Veterans of the Second World War were joined by serving soldiers today to launch this year's Poppy Appeal, marking the movement's 90th anniversary. Troops . from The Royal Highland Fusiliers, 2nd Battalion the Royal Regiment of . Scotland formed a giant 90 at their Glencorse Barracks in . Penicuik, Midlothian. The . event marks the start of the Scottish Poppy Appeal, which uses money . raised to provide support to veterans of all ages and from all . conflicts. It also coincides with the official launch of the Royal British Legion's Poppy Appeal in London, fronted by television presenter Gethin Jones. Past meets present: Second World War veterans and serving soldiers stood side by side to launch the 90th Poppy Appeal . Milestone: TV presenter Gethin Jones officially launched the Royal British Legion's 90th Poppy Appeal for 2011 at the Riverside Studios in London . William Walker, a 90-year-old veteran . who was wounded while serving with the Royal Scots in Burma in 1943, . was among those who attended the event to launch the appeal. Mr Walker, from Edinburgh, said: 'I was just a lad when I was shot in World War II and it was a terrifying experience. 'The . Scottish Poppy Appeal was there for our boys then and it is comforting . to know that it is still here, helping the men and women who are coming . back from Afghanistan today with terrible injuries. 'The Scottish Poppy Appeal changes lives and I would ask people to be generous when they are buying their poppy this year.' Side by side: Gethin Jones (second from right) with music group The Soldiers (from left to right) Lance Corporal Ryan Idzi, Staff Sergeant Ritchie Maddocks and Sergeant Major Gary Chilton . Last . year, a record £2.35 million was collected but Poppyscotland, the . charity that runs the appeal, said more money needs to be raised as it . believes there will be an increase in the numbers of veterans needing . support in the future. Ian . McGregor, the charity's chief executive, said: 'When the Scottish Poppy . Appeal was created in 1921, no-one would have considered that ninety . years on it would still be needed. 'Sadly, . it is needed as much now as it ever was, with more and more veterans . requiring a great deal of support to help them deal with often complex . and multiple needs. 'That's . why we are calling for the Scottish public to give as much as they can . to the appeal to ensure that veterans and their families, and Scotland, . will receive the help they need and deserve now and in the future.' Meanwhile the Royal British Legion's poppy appeal was launched by television presenter Gethin Jones today who was joined by the musical band The Soldiers. The trio of servicemen - consisting of Lance Corporal Ryan Idzi, Staff Sergant Ritchie Maddocks and Sergeant Major Gary Chilton - have recorded the official Poppy Appeal Song, I've Gotta Get A Message To You. To mark its 90th anniversary year, . the Legion launched its Poppy Appeal under the slogan of standing . 'shoulder to shoulder with all who serve'. The theme is backed by an online campaign and a chart-destined official single recorded by Robin Gibb and The Soldiers. The appeal will run from October 27 to November 13.","Past and present troops stand side-by-side to launch the appeal in its milestone year .

"Matthew VanDyke told his mother and girlfriend he was going to research a book . Locked in the notorious Abu Salim prison where inmates were murdered with machine guns in 1996 . Returned to the front line alongside rebels after he escaped . By . Lydia Warren . Last updated at 3:20 PM on 6th November 2011 . An American writer who went missing in Libya after fighting on the front line has returned to the United States. Matthew VanDyke, 32, from Baltimore, Maryland, was captured while on a reconnaissance mission in the north African nation and spent five months in solitary confinement in Libyan prisons. When he finally escaped, the freelance writer and filmmaker decided to stay on the front line until the despot had fallen. Home: Matthew VanDyke hugs his mother Sharon as he arrives in an airport near Baltimore, Maryland after fighting with rebel forces to end Muammar Gaddafi's regime in Libya . Holding up a new Libyan flag as he arrived at Baltimore-Washington International Marshall Airport and dressed in a military uniform, Mr VanDyke shouted: ‘Victory! We won!’ He left for Libya in February, just days after the uprising against dictator Moammar Gaddafi began. Arriving at the airport near his home on Saturday, he revealed he had told his family he planned to document the country’s revolution for a film and book he was working on. In fact, it was always his intention to join the uprising. 'You don’t tell your mother and girlfriend that you’re going to go fight in a war,' he explained on Saturday night. 'When . I got out of (a Libyan) prison, I was going to finish what I came to . do. So the past several weeks I've been in combat on the front lines in . Sirte fighting Gaddafi's forces.' Safe: VanDyke spent five months in solitary confinement in a prison in Abu Salim. He said he sang Guns N'Roses songs to himself and tried to name all the Star Trek characters to pass the time . Committed: After escaping prison, he returned to the front line to fight until Gaddafi had fallen. He shows reporters his identity card for the Hassan al-Jaber Brigade of the National Liberation Army of Libya . Mr VanDyke was met by his mother and girlfriend, who planted a kiss on his lips. Earlier . this year, Mr VanDyke was in Baltimore working on a book and film about a . motorcycle trip across the Middle East and southeast Asia when friends . in Libya started telling him their relatives were disappearing. He said: 'I wasn't going to sit back . and let this happen to people I care about and not do anything about it. I see how people are suffering under regimes like this and it's time . for it to end.' Mr VanDyke was on a reconnaissance mission in Brega when he was captured by Gaddafi forces. Reunited: VanDyke kisses his girlfriend Lauren Fischer as reporters look on . 'You don't tell your mother and girlfriend that you're going to go fight in a war': Fischer thought VanDyke was going to Libya to work on a book . He spent more than five months in solitary confinement in Libyan prisons. To pass the time, he sang Guns n' Roses songs to himself and tried to name all of the ‘Star Trek’ characters. He said he suffered from the psychological effects of solitary confinement. In a bid to free her son, Sharon VanDyke travelled to Turkey with his photos to speak to Libyan diplomats. Along . with her son’s girlfriend Lauren Fischer, she enlisted the help of C. A . Dutch Ruppersberger, a Maryland Democrat on the House Intelligence . Committee, who held a news conference in May to call attention to the . situation. Libyan officials denied Mr VanDyke was being held until July. Family: Sharon VanDyke (pictured) waits for her son to arrive on a flight at Baltimore-Washington International Airport. She had previously travelled to Turkey to speak with diplomats over his release . When the Abu Salim prison in Tripoli was bombed in August, fellow prisoners opened Mr VanDyke's cell and he escaped. He made his way to a compound, where he borrowed a phone to call home. Family members and the State Department urged him to return, but he said he wanted to finish what he went there to do. He . said: 'I felt appreciative that they spent time and resources to try to . help me and by keeping my story alive they did prevent the regime from . executing me and I'm very grateful for that. 'If . they had actually gotten me released then, yes, I probably would have . come home. I broke out and I ran for my life with other prisoners. I . freed myself and I come home when I wanted.' His girlfriend Lauren Fischer told Associated Press it was tough to learn he had always planned to fight in the revolution. Determined: VanDyke pictured on the front line in Sirte, Libya after fleeing the prison . Violence: VanDyke joined rebels to end the regime of Muammar Gaddafi, who had been in power for 42 years. Fighting began in February and persisted for eight months . She said: 'I knew that he went there to help his friends, not to fight, but to help his friends. 'It was not what I thought, but especially after five and a half months of not even knowing for sure where he was, I thought that was what was really more important to me was knowing that he was safe and OK.' 'Victory': Muammar Gaddafi was captured and shot in his home town of Sirte on October 20 . Deciding he would stay until Gaddafi fell, Mr VanDyke joined the Ali Hassan al-Jaber Brigade of the National Liberation Army of Libya. After Gaddafi was captured and killed last month, Mr VanDyke travelled to Tripoli to celebrate – and finally felt he could return home. He said: 'It's good to be home. I'm glad to be home. I'm glad that the job was finished. I wasn't going to leave until Gaddafi was out of power. He's gone, so I'm home.' Sharon VanDyke said: 'A lot of time of his life has been given to another country. I know Libyans appreciate it. 'I'm very proud of that he followed his commitment. I never once tried to make him come home. I told him all along that I would support his decisions.' Mr VanDyke said he plans to go to church on Sunday morning and spend time with his mother and girlfriend now that he is back. But he also admitted he wanted to go to other revolutions elsewhere in the Arab world. 'There's a lot more to be done,' he said. 'This is spreading.","Matthew VanDyke told his mother and girlfriend he was going to research a book .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:55 PM on 4th November 2011 . Israeli forces have boarded aid vessels trying to break its naval blockade of Gaza, the country's military said today. Two protest boats approached the Gaza coast on Friday with the intent to violate Israel's naval blockade of the territory, but were met by Israeli navy vessels, according to Palestinian activists. The boats were said to have been towed to the Israeli port of Ashdod, north-east of Gaza, following a 'peaceful' takeover. Taken over: In an image released by the Israel Defence Forces, one of the two Gaza-bound boats can be seen before it was boarded by members of the Israeli navy . After being spotted trying to break the Israel blockade, the nation's navy towed the boats to Ashdod, north-east of Gaza . The Irish and Canadian boats with 27 activists from America and eight other countries on board had set sail from Turkey on Wednesday. Activist Amjad Shaww said the Israelis told the boats, whose passengers had intended to carry on to Gaza, that they were entering a closed military zone. The Israeli military said only that it was 'monitoring' the two ships. Israel's navy has intercepted similar protest ships in the past, towing them to an Israeli port and detaining participants. Israel says its naval blockade of Gaza is vital to prevent weapons from reaching militant groups like Hamas, the Iran-backed group that rules the territory. Protest: A Palestinian boy looks on as Islamic Jihad militants take part in a rally in the northern Gaza strip . Goal: Islamic Jihad members are aiming for the destruction of the state of Israel and its replacement with an Islamic state . However, critics call the blockade collective punishment of Gaza's residents. Israel's government has said the activists can send supplies into Gaza overland. Last year, nine Turkish pro-Palestinian activists were killed when they resisted an Israeli operation to halt a similar flotilla. Each side blamed the other for the violence. Restrictions: Fishing boats in Gaza Fishing boats in Gaza have been told to operate within three nautical miles of the shore . The incident sparked an international outcry and forced Israel to ease its land blockade on Gaza, which was imposed in 2006 and tightened, with Egyptian cooperation, after Hamas seized control of the territory the following year. Militants in Gaza have fired thousands of rockets into Israel in the past decade, and now have much of southern Israel in range. Speaking after prayers at a Gaza City mosque, Ismail Haniyeh, the Hamas prime minister, addressed the passengers aboard the boats, saying, 'Your message has been delivered whether you make it or not.' 'The siege is unjust and must end,' Haniyeh said.",Aid vessels carrying activists and supplies towed to Israeli port by navy .

Police have been left baffled after a 22-year-old hairdresser was found dead in the driving seat of her torched car following a girls' night out with other stylists. Investigators believe Elizabeth Lightfoot was murdered, but are trying to determine exactly how as her body had been too burned to immediately tell.

There are no CCTV cameras at the scene of her death. 'It was nothing out of the ordinary from what I've found out,' Mr Keshishian told Fox News. 'Everything was just the same. I don't know if she saw anybody there, we're just puzzled. 'She wasn't stupid, she wouldn't have been uncareful.'

A mother was told her baby son was stillborn, only to discover him alive wrapped in a yellow plastic bag and dumped in a hospital bathroom. Four medics have been suspended after the incident Nanhai Red Cross Hospital in Foshan, China, where nurses also told the mother wrongly the child was a girl. It is yet another scandal to hit the city in Guangdong province where just a month ago a toddler died after being run over twice while being ignored by passers-by, sparking global outrage and raising questions over the country's humility. Scroll down for the video . Rescued: The little boy, who has yet to be named, is recovering well after his ordeal . China Daily reported mother Liu Dongmei, 23, was seven months pregnant when . she arrived at the hospital with her 24-year-old . husband, Wang Haizhang with internal bleeding and stomach cramps. After her delivery midwives broke the devastating news the child was not crying, or breathing and had turned purple. They then wrapped the child, which they mistakenly told Liu was a girl, in a yellow plastic bag and placed the baby in nearby bathroom, without informing a doctor. Discovery: Nursing staff pull the breathing baby from the yellow plastic bag in a bathroom .

According . to local newspaper reports, nurses at the hospital are believed to have . told the family the baby was a girl in an effort to 'soften the blow'. Lucky: The child is pulled from a bag after a relative noticed it was moving . Hao Hu, a senior pediatrician at No 6 . Hospital Affiliated to Sun Yat-sen University, questioned why medics . did not check the baby's pulse or eyes before putting him in a bathroom.

"By . Mail On Sunday Reporter . Last updated at 1:59 AM on 6th November 2011 . It has become traditional for David Cameron to appear at European summits in front of both the Union Jack and the EU emblem to illustrate the ‘dual sovereignty’ between London and Brussels. But now a senior EU official has caused outrage by appearing to suggest that the national flags of member states should be dropped in favour of the EU design of a circle of stars on a blue background. Christine Roger, the communications director of the European Council, the EU’s governing body, made her comments in a speech to 650 'spin doctors’ from local authorities across Europe, including the UK. Dual sovereignty: David Cameron frequently speaks in front of both the Union Jack and the EU flag . She called for a new, dedicated public-relations budget to help ‘sell’ the EU as a ‘brand’ to its increasingly disenchanted citizens. The meeting in Brussels last month, which cost taxpayers across the Continent tens of thousands of pounds, came as EU leaders were fighting to contain the eurozone economic crisis. In her speech, a copy of which has been seen by The Mail on Sunday, Ms Roger – a veteran Brussels apparatchik – posed a series of leading questions, including how Europe should be defined. ‘Are we talking about a state-to-be? About a federation?’ she asked. Then, as she flashed up a picture of French President Nicolas Sarkozy standing next to both a French and EU flag, she said: ‘How much do we believe in ourselves? For how long will we see Heads of State with the European flag alongside the national flag? If we don’t believe in ourselves, why should the world outside do so?’ Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy, with their national flags and the EU's . Last night, as Eurosceptic politicians accused her of calling for countries to sacrifice their national identity to promote the EU, Ms Roger insisted that she had been misinterpreted. One of her aides said: ‘What is meant in this presentation is clearly not about national flags. On the contrary, it is part of a discussion on how better to organise the branding and visual identity of the various European institutions and agencies for which there is, at present, no overall brand architecture. ‘The question, “For how long will we see Heads of State with the European flag alongside the national flag?” is meant to underscore the importance of the European brand being clear and simple. In other words the implication is, if it is not, will member states continue to use it?’ In her presentation, Ms Roger also called for more money to be poured into the EU’s image as a ‘single entity’. She said: ‘If member states do not invest enough in the European brand, a proliferation of sub-brands is sure. Branding contributes to improving Europe’s internal and worldwide reputation as a social and political entity, making Europe’s achievements easy to identify for stakeholders and citizens [and] building a sense of common belonging.’ She called for more money to be ploughed into advertising the benefits of the EU, adding: ‘There is no common funding for a European communication policy.’ She said one should be developed ‘to communicate on European achievements’. Nigel Farage: 'It's like a competition to be the most stupid' UKIP leader Nigel Farage described the plans as a further example of national identities being trampled. ‘This summit was a disgusting waste of taxpayers’ money, typical of the delusional EU and its staff who see any disaster as an opportunity and think that money grows on trees,’ he said. ‘This organisation has recently voted to increase its budget while hard-working people struggle in a financial crisis. ‘Their choices and priorities are so unwelcome and so unhelpful it’s as if they are having a competition within the EU to see who can be the most stupid. ‘I must say, the competition is looking pretty fierce.’ Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles also entered the row last night, questioning why communications experts from British councils had been sent to the meeting to hear Ms Roger and other experts speak. ‘I don’t think it’s appropriate that taxpayers should foot the bill for a spin doctors’ summit in Brussels,’ said Mr Pickles. ‘I cannot understand what the business case is for councils attending events such as this. During these tough economic times, local authorities should be focusing all their efforts on protecting frontline services.’ A spokesman for the EU Committee of the Regions, which organised the meeting, said: ‘The event brought together communications managers from local, regional, national and EU authorities to share case studies of communication activities aimed at bringing the European Union closer to the citizens. ‘When organising this event we made great efforts to keep  the costs down and achieve the best possible impact with very limited resources. ‘The total cost amounted to around €50,000 [£43,000] for  a two-day event bringing together 75 speakers and  650 participants.’","Senior officials cause outrage by suggesting member states should drop their flags in favour of the EU design .

"By . Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 3:17 PM on 4th November 2011 . A suspected terrorist granted refugee status by Britain has been banned from flying back into the country over fears he could be plotting a terror attack, it was revealed today. It is understood that security officials have ordered airlines around the world to stop Reda Taher Nasouf boarding planes bound for the UK. Steps are also being taken by officials to strip the Algerian, who is believed to be in the north African country, of his refugee status, according to the Daily Mirror. Flight ban: It is understood that security officials have ordered airlines around the world to stop Reda Taher Nasouf boarding planes bound for the UK . It is the first time such a ban has been used to prevent a suspect flying into Britain because of terror fears, according to the newspaper. The Home Office said it does not comment on individual cases, but a spokesman told the Mail Online: ‘We make no apologies for refusing people access to the UK if we believe they represent a threat. ‘Coming here is a privilege we refuse to extend to those who seek to subvert our values.’ A source told the Mirror: 'It is about disrupting something in the planning stages before it becomes a risk to British citizens and it was not done without careful consideration. 'Everything is being done to strip this man of his refugee status.' Under the Aviation Security Act 1982, the Secretary of State is able to direct any airline operating in the UK to take any measure necessary to counter any threat to aviation. Intelligence officers have been tracking Nasouf for months and suspect he could be in the early stages of plotting a terror attack against UK civilians, according to The Mirror. It is thought he may have already spent some time in Britain as a refugee but returned to Algeria allegedly to plot his atrocity and was hoping to return soon. The UK Border Agency will today begin proceeding to revoke Nasouf's refugee status, the tabloid claimed. The security alert threat level last night remained at 'substantial' meaning a terror attack in the UK is a 'strong possibility'.","Airlines around the world ordered to stop Reda Taher Nasouf boarding planes bound for the UK .

A teenager convicted of killing a . mother and her 13-year-old son when she crashed head-on into . their car while driving at 85mph in 2009 has broken her silence. In an interview for the TV show . Dateline, the much vilified Justine Winter finally says sorry to the . family of her victims, pregnant Erin Thompson, 35, and her son Caden. Winter, from Montana, said: 'I don't want to put them through any more pain than they've been put through already.' Scroll down for video . Remorse: Justine Winter breaks down as she apologizes to her family and the family of her victims . She also apologized to own her family, saying: 'My family was put in a lot of pain because of the accident. But they've got to see me grow up.' Winter is serving a 15-year sentence for the killings and, at 18, is the youngest inmate at Montana Women's Prison. Asked if she would finally take responsibility for the horror, she said she would, but claims she cannot remember a single thing about the crash. Vilified: Winter, the youngest inmate at Montana Women's Prison, said she found it hard to read the comments people have written about her breaks her silence . Winter said: 'If I knew then I would take responsibility for it. 'If it was me I would take complete, utter responsibility for it ... and I do.' She said she has been hurt by some of the comments she has read or heard about the case. 'They are really hard to read,' Winter said. 'I read one that said I need to hang from a noose on a tree.' Twisted wreckage: The remains of vehicle driven by Erin Thompson, who was pregnant at the time . The crash happened after Winter had fought with her boyfriend. The argument continued through heated text messages as she drove home. In one text, shortly before crash, she told her boyfriend Ryan Langford that she wanted to kill herself. At her trial Winter and her defence team insisted it was an accident rather than a suicide attempt. Tragedy: Erin Thompson, 35, and her son Caden, 13, died instantly in the collision . Proud moment: Caden was performing in a school concert and was on his way home the night he and his mother died . They even said it was the fault of Mrs Thompson, who was travelling at just 30mph at the time. Winter had a multitude of injuries and suffered brain damage after going through countless surgeries. She was found guilty of double homicide after Winter and her defence team insisted it was an accident rather than a suicide attempt. Tribute: Jason Thompson said of his wife Erin that meeting her was the 'culmination of his dreams' Winter's attorneys David Stufft and Maxwell Battle argued during the two-week trial in late February and early March and  that it was Thompson's vehicle that crossed over into Winter's lane. The theory was discredited by law enforcement officials, prosecutors, multiple crash reconstruction experts and an eyewitness. But Winter - both in a written statement and during her testimony - appeared to maintain her belief that it was an accident. Flathead County Deputy Attorney Lori Adams opened the trial by reading selected text messages allegedly sent from Winter’s cellular phone to her then-boyfriend Ryan Langford in the hours leading up to the crash. Among them were the words 'It's ending' and 'I want to kill myself, good bye Ryan,' Adams said. The final message was sent only six minutes before Winter’s car collided with Thompson's. Sentence: Justine Winter, who was 16 at the time, was found guilty of double homicide and jailed for 15 years . The prosecution also argued that she was not even wearing a seatbelt. After being found guilty of two counts of deliberate homicide, she was sentenced to two concurrent 30 year sentences, though the judge suspended 15 years of each. The judge heaped praise on Erin Thompson's family, saying their courage and compassion was remarkable. In return to the tragic loss and emptiness in their lives, they only asked that the 18-year-old apologise. According to the Daily Inter Lake, when given a chance, the Evergreen resident seemed to stop short of accepting full responsibility. Winter's sentencing on Monday June 6 came two days after she graduated with honours from Glacier High School. She did not attend graduation because she was in jail. The interview with Justine Winter airs on the Dateline special Crossing The Line on NBC on Friday, 10pm, 9pm Central.

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 10:46 AM on 4th November 2011 . Three men who were jailed for almost 20 years over the rape and murder of a 14-year-old girl have been released after new DNA evidence came to light. Robert Taylor, 34, said it felt 'beautiful' to be free 20 years after being sent to prison for the attack on Cateresa Matthews in Dixmoor, near Chicago. Brothers Jonathan Barr, 34, and James Harden, 36, have also been told they will be released while prosecutors are confident the final two men will also be exonerated. Released: Robert Taylor, 34, left, walked free two decades after the murder of Cateresa Matthews. Jonathan Barr, 34, is also set to be released . Cateresa disappeared after leaving her . grandmother's house in November 1991 and her body was found weeks later . near a highway with a gunshot wound to the mouth. The murder went unsolved for about a year before five teenagers were arrested in 1992. Two signed confessions and agreed to . testify against the others for shorter prison sentences, even though . attorneys said there were inconsistencies in their testimony and DNA . evidence taken from the girl did not match any of them. Robert Taylor, 34, who walked out of Stateville Correctional Center in Illionois yesterday, said it was great to be out. 'I'm still getting used to it. (But) I knew it would come,' he said. 'I'm always going to be angry, due to what . was taken away from me. I can't get that back. 'I'm not . going to let my anger drive what I want to do with the rest of my life. There is so much I want to do.' Wrongly convicted: James Harden, 36, was just a teenager when he was charged with murder . Prosecutors reopened the case this year after new DNA testing linked a convicted rapist to the crime. He has not been charged with the killing, but remains under investigation. The 53-year-old is currently serving time behind bars for a drugs offence, authorities said. Two years ago defense attorneys . asked for new DNA testing to be carried out amid growing fears the five had been wrongly convicted. Earlier this year the breakthrough came when swabs from the 1991 murder were matched to a man who is now aged 53. The group - dubbed the Dixmoor Five - all knew each other and the victim from school. Defense attorneys claimed the . teenagers were questioned relentlessly - and at least one of them was . told he could see his parents if they confessed. Robert Lee Veal, 34, and Shainne . Sharp, 36, confessed and agreed to testify against the others in . exchange for reduced 20-year prison sentences. Records show each served . about 10 years. Veal, who has 'severe learning . disabilities,' could not read when he was arrested and signed a . confession not knowing what it was, his attorney Stuart Chanen said. Taylor also had confessed to the . crime, but later recanted saying it was coerced. He and Harden were . sentenced to 80 years in prison. Barr received 85 years. Robert Taylor's attorney Josh Tepfer said: 'It's truly unexplainable. 'It's one of the most tragic injustices in this state's history. It's five kids who were wrongfully convicted... while a true perpetrator went on and lived a criminal lifestyle.' Robert Lee Veal, 34, has been unable to find work because of his conviction . Barr and Harden were both in custody at Menard Correctional Center and will be released once paperwork has been completed. Tara Thompson, who represented Harden, said: 'Their mother and father passed away while they were in prison. 'He missed the opportunity to go to college. Everything you've done in your life since high school, he's missed out on that.' The case is among the dozens of wrongful conviction cases in Illinois made public in recent years. Allegations of torture and coerced confessions by Chicago police eventually helped lead then-Republican Governor George Ryan in 2000 to impose a moratorium on Illinois' death penalty. Shainne . Sharp, 36, is now behind bars after committing a separate drugs offence. Veal, 34, is 'very happy' to have heard the news, his attorney said. While he has been out of prison since 2002, his conviction dramatically altered the course of his life and he has been unable to find work. 'It's virtually impossible to get a job with a murder conviction, with being an ex-con ... on your rap sheet,' his Attorney Stuart Chanen said. 'At least he gets the stench of that off his record.'","Three men released after 20 years behind bars .

Many thousands of fatal illnesses could be avoided in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland - if they would only adopt the diet of their English neighbours. As many as 80 per cent of preventable deaths from the biggest killer diseases would be eliminated if the rest of the UK followed England's nutritional habits, according to new research. But experts say that this does not give the English 'bragging rights', as even they are not eating a very balanced diet. Perhaps best not to follow the dietary habits of Rab C Nesbitt (pictured in a scene from the comedy with long-suffering wife Mary) given researchers found people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland consistently eat more calories, more fat and more salt than those living in England . They have proposed a 'fat tax' to improve the diet of the UK as a whole and reduce regional inequality in health. The research showed that people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland consistently eat more calories, more fat and more salt than those living in England, and fewer fruit and vegetables. Eight out of 10 unnecessary deaths from cancer, heart disease and stroke in Wales and Northern Ireland - and four in 10 of those in Scotland - could be prevented if people ate the 'average' diet in England. Analysis of diets between 2007 and 2009 found that, on average, people in Scotland and Northern Ireland also ate 7.5g of salt daily compared to 7g in England, while those in Wales ate 7.4g. Salt increases blood pressure and the risk of heart disease and stroke. Those in Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales also ate more fat and saturated fat and less fruit. People in Scotland ate about 951g of vegetables a week, while those in Northern Ireland ate 902g, compared to the higher 1,190g in England. Experts from the University of Oxford and the John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford also looked at 10 cancers associated with diet, including those of the gullet, bowel, and stomach. They noted that death rates for heart disease, stroke and cancer are higher in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland than they are in England. Calculations showed that between 2007 and 2009, just under 22,000 more people died in Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland from stroke, heart disease and diet-related cancers than would be expected if death rates were as low as in England. Head to head: Are fish and chips really more healthy than haggis and chips? Over the period, 3,005 deaths in Wales, . 6,353 in Scotland and 1,890 in Northern Ireland could have been 'delayed . or averted' if the English diet was adopted, the study found. The authors concluded: 'Diet has a substantial impact on geographical variations in mortality from coronary heart disease, stroke and various cancers within the UK.' They said identifying 'fiscal initiatives aimed at increasing the cost of foods high in saturated fat (so called ""fat taxes"") may be best placed to reduce geographical inequalities in health if they are paired with subsidies for fruit and vegetables.' People in Scotland ate about 951g of vegetables a week, while those in Northern Ireland ate 902g, compared to the higher 1,190g in England . Victoria Taylor, senior dietician at the British Heart Foundation, said: 'This research isn't about bragging rights to the English or tit-for-tat arguments about how healthy our traditional dishes might be. 'Saying the rest of the UK should follow England's lead to cut heart deaths isn't a foolproof solution - a quarter of English adults are obese and only 30 per cent eat their five-a-day.'","Death rates for heart disease, stroke and cancer higher in Scotland, Wales, and Northern Ireland than England .

An asteroid the size of an aircraft carrier is set to pass closer to Earth than the moon - the nearest anything this big has come to our planet in 35 years. The space rock has been classed as a 'potentially hazardous object' because it will shave our planet .8 lunar distances away on Tuesday, November 8. Experts have calculated that if something of that size were to hit Earth it would cause a 4,000 megaton blast, a magnitude 7.0 earthquake, and if it hit water a 70-foot high tsunami would spread within 60 miles of the crash site. The last time a rock this big passed so close was in 1976, but it was missed by everybody, including NASA. Near-Earth asteroid: 2005 YU55 will shave our planet .8 lunar distances away on Tuesday, November 8 . NASA's Near-Earth Object manager Don Yeomans said this week that they are to carefully study 2005 YU55, which will be 200,000 miles away, because it will give 'clues as to what it was like when our solar system was forming.' 'Without objects of this type, we probably wouldn't be here,' he added. This asteroid is in orbit around the Sun and has not been this near to Earth for some 200 years. Giant: Antennas at the Goldstone radar centre in California's Mojave Desert, pictured, will be focussed on the asteroid . It will not be visible to the naked eye, but amateur astronomers could see it if they use a telescope at least 6in in diameter as it approaches from a sunward direction. Encounters of objects this large, this close to our planet, will not happen again until 2028 when an asteroid will pass near Earth to within .6 lunar distances. NASA will use its super-sensitive Goldstone radar antennas in California’s Mojave Desert, usually used to study quasars, as well as map planets and comets. Close shave: The 2005 YU55 asteroid will flash by Earth just 200,000 miles away next week, nearly 30 years since the last one of a similar size came past . Holding secrets: A radar image of 2005 YU55 captured by the Arecibo Observatory in Puerta Rico last year . Scientists say they can reconstruct the shape of the asteroid with a resolution as fine as 13 feet using their instruments and plan to do similar studies at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. 2005 YU55 was 'imaged' in Puerto Rico on April 19 last year. The . data collected has allowed the Near-Earth Object Program Office at . NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) to refine the space rock's orbit, . enabling scientists to rule out any possibility of an Earth impact for . the next 100 years. Safe for now: Data obtained from the Arecibo Observatory has ruled out the chance of 2005 YU55 smashing into Earth within the next 100 years . A NASA spokesman said: 'We hope to obtain images that should reveal a wealth of detail about the asteroid's surface features, shape, dimensions and other physical properties.' Barbara Wilson, a scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory added: 'While near-Earth objects of this size have flown within a lunar distance in the past, we did not have the foreknowledge and technology to take advantage of the opportunity. 'When it flies past, it should be a great opportunity for science instruments on the ground to get a good look.'","2005 YU55 will be 200,000 miles away on November 8 .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 2:45 AM on 6th November 2011 . They are a hidden maze of tunnels where a bloody underground war was played out in terrifying darkness and where the bodies of 28 heroes lie entombed forever. Now, after lying practically undisturbed since troops laid down their arms in 1918 and just days before Remembrance Sunday, the secrets and tragedies of the labyrinth are finally being revealed thanks to work by archaeologists. Since January, the . Anglo-French La Boiselle Study Group has been working with historians . to open up and explore the tunnels to discover more about the lives of the men lost in them. Heroes: Tunnelling Company workers pictured together at the Somme in 1916. 28 tunnellers died at La Boisselle . The passages, named the Glory Hole by . British troops, run under and around the sleepy village of La Boisselle . in northern France, which was of huge strategic importance to the 1916 Battle of the Somme. The infamous four-month battle claimed the lived of millions, including 420,000 British soldiers - all for just a few yards of territory. Twenty eight Britain tunnellers died in the passages between August 1915 and April 1916 and their bodies now lie permanently buried within . the collapsed tunnel walls. Finds: A French soldier's metal drinking cup, left, and a margarine tin issued as part of the ration were found . At war: German soldiers of the 111th Reserve Infantry Regiment. The lips thrown up by the mine craters can be seen behind them . Most were a mining 'elite' sent from collieries across Britain, but never returned home. One . victim was Sapper John Lane, 45, from Tipton in Staffordshire, a . married father-of-four killed along with four others 80ft underground on . 22 November 1915. His . great-grandson, Chris Lane, 45, from Redditch in Worcestershire, said he . had been gripped to learn about his relative’s fate, the BBC said in . June. BBC journalist Robert Hall was among the first people to venture into the newly opened tunnels, many of which run up to 100ft deep. He has documented his account in the Daily Mirror. From bottles of drink and tins of . food, graffiti, helmets, picks and bits of shrapnel, he discovered all . sorts of eerie reminders of these lesser known heroes of the Great War. Digging deep: BBC journalist Robert Bell was one of the first people to enter the newly-opened tunnel . A camera getting ready for its descent down the 50 foot W-shaft. Archaeologists have been working on the site since January . Discoveries: British .303 rifle ammunition and the heads of tooth brushes were found inside the passages . Almost . 90 years ago the passages would . have been full of tunnellers digging, laying explosives, and bringing . soil to the surface aided by a recently discovered small railway - all . with the Germans often just yards away doing exactly the same. Mr Hall wrote of the tunnels: 'The first thing that strikes you is how untouched they look.' A poem scrawled on a wall he passed read: 'If in this place you are . detained; Don’t look around you all in vain; But cast your net and you . will find; That every cloud is silver lined.' Top: A British shovel carried by infantrymen and below special strengthened pick used by the miners . BBC reporter Robert Hall, right, has been investigating the tunnels at La Boisselle . This is how the village became strategically important. On 28 September 1914 the German advance was halted by French troops at La Boisselle. The two sides fought for the possession of the civilian cemetery and farm buildings. In December that year, French engineers . began tunnelling under the ruins which sparked the prolonged battle . below ground lasting until 1916. Both sides tried to probe underneath each . other's trenches, setting off explosives to undermine . fortifications, working at a depth of about 12 metres. The British Tunnelling Companies sent in miners to deepen these tunnels and crater system to 30 metres while above ground infantry occupied trenches just 45 metres apart. At the start of the Battle of the Somme La Boisselle stood on the main axis of British attack. To aid the attack the British placed two . huge mines, known as Y Sap and Lochnagar, on either flank, but they failed to neutralise the German defences in the village. The village was eventually captured from the Germans on July 4. Military mining was key to tactics of . both the Allies and the Germans during the conflict with tunnellers . digging and laying explosives to undermine each other's fortifications. During the 1917 Battle of Messines, 10,000 Germans were killed after 455 tons of explosive was planted in 21 tunnels. And, . two years earlier, in October 1915, 179 Tunnelling Company began to . sink a series of deep shafts to try and stop German miners approaching . beneath the British front line. At a location known as W Shaft they went down from 30 feet to 80 feet and began to drive two counter-mine tunnels towards the Germans. But they heard sounds of German digging getting louder and explosives were prepared and planted. Company Commander Captain Henry Hance spent six hours listening and worked out the Germans were 15 yards away. However, 24 hours later the Germans set off their own explosives, which detonated the British charge too. Carbon monoxide gas was released by . the huge explosion proving fatal for the tunnellers working underground. Four bodies were found; William Walker, . Andrew Taylor, James Glen and Robert Gavin. The bodies of two other men from Staffordshire, John Lane and Ezekiel Parkes, were never found. Military historian Simon Jones, from . the University of Birmingham, has studied the tunnellers of the 179th . and 185th Tunnelling Companies and following seven years of research, learned who they were and . how and when they died. British infantrymen occupying a shallow trench before advancing during the Battle of the Somme on the first day of battle in 1916 . One of the German trenches in Guillemont during the Battle of the Somme. The battle began at 7.30am that day, and by the following morning 19,240 British soldiers had died . The Battle of the Somme took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916 in the Somme area of France . The battle consisted of an offensive by the British and French armies against the German Army, which, since invading France in August 1914, had occupied large areas of that country. The Allies gained little ground over the four month battle - just five miles in total by the end. The battle is controversial because of the tactics employed and is significant as tanks were used for the first time. On the first day of fighting the British lost more than 19,000 men and 420,000 in total. Sixty per cent of all officers involved on the first day were killed. By the time fighting ceased there were more than 1 million casualties, including 650,000 Germans. He studied letters, maps and records as well as tunnel plans and diaries to uncover the truth about the deaths. The number of German tunnellers killed remains unclear. Mr Jones told Mr Hall: 'What comes across is the human endeavour. 'And . the fact these men, most of them volunteers from Britain's coal mines, . were a breed apart, and regarded themselves as an elite.' Military historian Peter Barton told Mr Hall: 'It's been a moving experience for us all.' Owners of the site, the Lejeune . family, decided to let archaeologists into the site in January. It is . hoped the area will be preserved once work is completed. The project is the first of its kind . on the Western Front and has been officially sanctioned by the French . archaeological authorities. It is envisaged that work may continue for up to fifteen years. For more information see www.laboisselleproject.com .

A Scout leader jailed for sexually assaulting an 11-year-old girl on a camping trip is appealing to the European Court of Human Rights to be taken off the Sex Offenders Register claiming it breaches his human rights. Andrew Deaves, who was jailed for two years last July but who has now been freed, said that being on the list was making his life 'a misery' and made it 'almost impossible' to go on holiday and see friends. The 51-year-old has written to the court in Strasbourg in a bid to have his name taken off the register. There are around 30,000 perverts on the Sex Offenders Register, which monitors the activity of convicted sex offenders and tries to ensure they cannot commit crimes again again. In his letter to the court, Deaves states that the register is 'draconian' and that it is making it hard for him to go on holiday or visit friends. He said he has to continue reporting to a local police station at least once a year to sign the register and said the police can visit his house unannounced at any time. Deaves said at each visit photographs and other details like his National Insurance number and car registration are taken. Letter: Mr Deaves has written to the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg to have his name taken off the register . He wrote: 'Being on the register also means that . every time I leave the country for work or holiday, for more than three . days, I have to go to the police station and give them full details of . my visit including the destination address and length of stay. 'Also if I am to visit friends or family . within the United Kingdom and my aggregate stay anywhere is more than . seven days, again I have to register that address with the police. I would like to appeal against one of the most draconian pieces of legislation being implemented in UK, which is the ‘sex offenders register’. Being on the sex offenders register means that even after finishing my full sentence, I will have to continue reporting to a local police station at least once a year to sign the register and/or the police can visit my house unannounced any time of their choosing. At each visit my photographs and other details like my National Insurance number and my car’s registration number are also taken. Being on the register also means that every time I leave the country for work or holiday, for more than three days, I have to go to the police station and give them full details of my visit including the destination address and length of stay, also if I am to visit friends or family within the United Kingdom and my aggregate stay anywhere is more than seven days, again I have to register that address with the police. In other words u have to register the details of my friends and family as well who have not committed any crime. This makes me seriously wonder that would most of my friends and family would want to keep ties with me knowing that their names and addresses are going to be on a police register as part of the sex offenders register. I strongly believe that keeping me on the SOR is in serious breach of not just mine but my family’s human rights, fundamental freedoms, freedom of movement and Right to respect for private and family life. It also prevents us from returning to any kind of normal life after doing my sentence and paying my penance. Being on the sex offenders register is just like getting out of a smaller prison and then living the rest of your life in a bigger prison. I would be grateful for your intervention to have my name removed from the UK sex offenders register. 'In other words you have to register the details of my friends and family as well who have not committed any crime. 'This makes me seriously wonder that . would most of my friends and family would want to keep ties with me . knowing that their names and addresses are going to be on a police . register as part of the sex offenders register.' In the letter, also published in Inside Time magazine, he added: 'I strongly believe that keeping me on the Sex Offenders Register is in serious breach of not just mine but my family's human rights, fundamental freedoms, freedom of movement and right to respect for private and family life. 'It also prevents us from returning to any kind of normal life after doing my sentence and paying my penance.' Croydon Crown Court heard in July last year how Deaves was arrested after he reported the girl he had sexually abused after she contacted him and told him she would go to the police if he didn't give her money to keep quiet. When police interviewed the girl, who was 19 last year, on suspicion of blackmail they discovered the truth and arrested Deaves at his home in Norwood, south London. The girl told them that Deaves had repeatedly sexually assaulted her during a summer outing in 2002 when she was just 11. forcing her to perform sexual acts on him. Deaves admitted two counts of gross indecency with a child, two indecent assaults and breach of trust and was jailed for two years and banned from being in the company of children under the age of 16 last July. He was also put on the Sex Offenders' Register for 10 years. Recorder Daphne Wickham, in sentencing the pervert, told him: 'The sentence will bring your career and your work in the community to an end. 'I accept it was you who stopped the contact. It was a reflection on the mess you made of your life. 'But you should never ever have done that to a little girl.'",Andrew Deaves says being on the list breaches his human rights .
"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 12:42 PM on 3rd November 2011 . For many teenagers, being told NOT to eat fruit and vegetables would be welcome news. But Chrissie Roberts, now 22, was devastated when she was told she could no longer tuck into the fresh produce after developing a bizarre allergy. The student developed a bizarre allergy to fruit at her boarding school when she was 15-years-old. Allergic: If Chrissie ate the fruit she is pictured holding her throat would close up and she would suffocate . Now at university, Chrissie must take a cocktail of vitamins to compensate for the lack of nutrition in her diet. She wants to raise awareness for others about her rare condition which also means she has to avoid many cosmetics and fruit-based shampoos. Experts diagnosed Chrissie with 'oral allergy syndrome', which is made up from a cluster of allergic reactions in the mouth to fresh fruits and vegetables. It typically develops in hay fever sufferers but can improve in later life. The former public schoolgirl was boarding at Trinity School, inDevon, when she experienced her first reaction. Miss Roberts said: 'We used to get melon every day during break times. 'One day I was messing around with my friends and I put my whole face into the fruit. 'After about 10 minutes I had a red raw rash on my face and my throat began closing up. 'I love melon and I tried to eat it again but the reaction was even moreextreme the second time so I knew I must be allergic. 'After that I started having reactions to all fruit and some vegetables. It gotso bad that I was forced to cut it out of my diet completely. 'People accused me of making it up and said I was a fussy eater orthat I was just doing it for attention. 'But nothing could be further from the truth. You've got no idea how hard it is to avoid eating or coming into contact with fruit. 'I have to take it really seriously. When it happens my airways close up andI've been told I could suffocate to death if I left it untreated.' Chrissie not only has to keep an eagle eye out for fruit within other foods but has to check cosmetic products. She told how an innocent sleep over turned into a nightmare when sheexperimented with a new hair conditioner. She said: 'I was having a girly night in with my friend Harriet and we decided to use this new hair treatment she bought that's meant to repair split ends. 'After a few minutes I felt this burning sensation on my back and I had redwelts where the conditioner had dripped off my hair. 'I ran screaming into the shower and managed to get it all rinsed off.When I read the packaging I saw it had avocado in it. I though 'oh greatanother thing I can't eat'.' Awareness: Chrissie wants to highlight oral allergy syndrome . Chrissie's mother Michelle and stepfather Kevin, from Wells, in Somerset, are both pharmacists and make sure she is fully equipped with antihistamines for whenever she goes back to university. Currently studying animation at Camborne University in Cornwall Chrissie joked that she's not all that different from everyday students. Chrissie said: 'Most my friends are pretty much on a fruit free diet anyway so I don't notice that I can't have it most of the time. 'But I do miss eating it. It's ironic because I was really healthy before thishappened and I always made sure I had my five a day.' A spokeswoman from Allergy UK said: 'Fresh fruit and vegetables are common causes of an unusual condition called oral allergy syndrome. 'Oral allergy syndrome is the medical term for an allergic reaction to foodwhich is limited to the lips, mouth and throat. 'Those who suffer with seasonal allergic rhinitis or 'hay fever' are more than likely to suffer, as it has been shown that pollens from trees (especially Birch), grasses and weeds contain proteins of similar structure to those present in certain fruit, vegetables, nuts and spices. 'These proteins are recognised by the immune system of a person with hay fever and can trigger an allergic reaction in a susceptible person when they eat a food which shares the same protein as the pollen. 'If you have oral allergy symptoms, it is important that you are referred to an allergy specialist. This will ensure that you have a correct diagnosis and appropriate treatment. 'Avoidance of the foods that cause your reactions is most important. Usually, cooking will destroy the allergens so that you need not worry about cooked food.'",Chrissie always had her five-a-day before she developed a severe allergic reaction to fresh fruits .
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:13 PM on 15th September 2011 . President Barack Obama today recognised the sacrifice of a courageous U.S. Marine by giving him the nation's highest military award, the Medal of Honor. In a solemn ceremony in the White House's East Room, Mr Obama told the family and friends of Sgt Dakota Meyer how, in a conflict that has produced thousands of American heroes, the 23-year-old's extraordinary tale of courage stands out from the rest. Meyer charged through heavy insurgent gunfire on five death-defying trips in an armoured Humvee to save 13 Marines and Army soldiers and another 23 Afghan troops pinned down by withering enemy fire. He personally killed at least eight insurgents despite taking a shrapnel wound to one arm as he manned the gun turret of the Humvee and provided covering fire for the soldiers, according to the military. Stoic: President Barack Obama awards the Medal of Honor to former Marine Cpl Dakota Meyers, 23, from Greensburg, Kentucky . Valor: Meyer ran through enemy fire to recover bodies of fellow troops in Afghanistan . Honoured: President Obama shakes hands with Dakota Meyer at the end of the ceremony . Dakota Meyer 'placed himself in the thick of the fight... again, again, and again,' President Obama said, recalling the events of September 8, 2009, when Meyer defended his fellow soldiers in far-off Kunar Province, Afghanistan during an ambush attack. 'You did your duty, above and beyond,' President Obama said. 'Because of your honor, 36 men are alive today.' Meyer, now a civilian,  also accepted the Medal in Honor of four comrades who did not survive the attack. The White House said Meyer is the third living recipient of the military decoration for actions in Afghanistan or Iraq. He is the first Marine so honoured with the medal. His hero's moment, however, was his . darkest day. Meyer lost some of his best friends the morning of the ambush. 'It's . hard, it's... you know... getting recognised for the worst day of your . life, so it's... it's a really tough thing,' Meyer said prior to the ceremony, struggling for . words. Meyer's slain comrades will be memorialised in hometown ceremonies at his request. The ceremony comes after an informal meeting between Meyer and President Obama on Wednesday, when the two men were pictured having a beer on a patio outside the Oval Office.

White House spokesman Jay Carney tweeted: 'Over the weekend, . the President's staff called Meyer in preparation for Thursday's Medal . of Honor ceremony at the White House. Meyer asked the staffer if he . could have a beer with the President. POTUS invited Dakota to come by . the White House this afternoon.' The Medal of Honor, awarded by the U.S. government, is bestowed by the President on members of the U.S. Armed Forces who distinguish themselves through 'conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his or her life above and beyond the call of duty while engaged in an action against an enemy of the United States.' According to the Congressional Medal of Honor Society: . In . Afghanistan, Meyer was part of a security team supporting a patrol . moving into a village in the Ganjgal Valley on the day of the ambush. Meyer . and the other Americans had gone to the area to train Afghan military . members when, suddenly, the village lights went out and gunfire erupted. About 50 Taliban insurgents on mountainsides and in the village had . ambushed the patrol. As the forward team took fire and called for . air support that wasn't coming, Meyer, a corporal at the time, begged . his command to let him head into the incoming fire to help. Four . times he was denied his request before Meyer and another Marine, Staff . Sgt Juan Rodriguez-Chavez, jumped into the Humvee and headed into the . fray. For his valor, Rodriguez-Chavez, a 34-year-old who hailed . originally from Acuna, Mexico, would be awarded the Navy Cross. 'They . told him he couldn't go in,' said Dwight Meyer, Dakota Meyer's . 81-year-old grandfather, a former Marine who served in the 1950s. 'He . told them, ""The hell I'm not,"" and he went in. It's a one-in-a-million . thing' that he survived. With Meyer manning the Humvee's gun . turret, the two drew heavy fire. But they began evacuating wounded . Marines and American and Afghan soldiers to a safe point. Meyer made . five trips into the kill zone, each time searching for the forward . patrol with his Marine friends - including 1st Lt Michael Johnson - . whom Meyer had heard yelling on the radio for air support. With . Meyer and Rodriguez-Chavez ready to test fate a fifth time in the kill . zone, a UH-60 helicopter arrived at last to provide overhead support. Troops aboard the chopper told Meyer they had spotted what appeared to . be four bodies. Meyer knew those were his friends and he had to bring . them out. 'It might sound crazy, but it was just, you don't . really think about it, you don't comprehend it, you don't really . comprehend what you did until looking back on it,' Meyer said. Wounded and tired, Meyer left the relative safety of the Humvee and ran out on foot. 'He just really took a chance,' Dwight Meyer said. Ducking . around buildings to avoid heavy gunfire, he reached the bodies of . Johnson, a 25-year-old from Virginia Beach; Staff Sgt Aaron Kenefick, . 30, of Roswell, Georgia; Corpsman James Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California; . and Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr, a 31-year-old gunnery sergeant from . Columbus, Georgia. Meyer and two other soldiers dodged bullets and . rocket-propelled grenades to pull the bodies out of a ditch where the . men had died while trying to take cover. The deaths of Meyer's . comrades prompted an investigation into events that day, and two Army . officers were later reprimanded for being 'inadequate and ineffective' and for 'contributing directly to the loss of life.' Along with Meyer's . friends, a fifth American - Army Sgt Kenneth W Westbrook, 41, of . Shiprock, New Mexico - was fatally wounded in the ambush. Respected: Meyer, 23, signs a book for one of his high school teachers before giving remarks to his high school faculty and staff at Green County High School in Greensburg, Kentucky on August 3 . Remembrance: Meyer, 23, shows the black wristbands he wears on each arm honouring the three Marines and Navy corpsman who were killed in action in Ganjgal, Afghanistan, during the ambush . Meyer said . he'll be humbled by the memory of his fallen comrades as he receives the . award on Thursday. One of the memorials will be at a Columbus cemetery for . gunnery sergeant Johnson, a father of three who served nearly 13 years . in the U.S. Marine Corps. Will Duke, one of the organisers, said the memorials spoke volumes about Meyer. 'I . can tell by his actions, not only the actions he took in earning the . Medal of Honor in Afghanistan but also the actions he is taking now. Essentially by requesting these memorial services for his fallen . comrades, he's saying this is about them,' Duke said.","Heroic soldier saved 13 .

"By . Ray Massey . Last updated at 7:03 PM on 4th November 2011 . Good news: Lower petrol prices for drivers is welcomed by the AA, but towns without an Asda could pay 8p more . Supermarket giant Asda sparked a price war today by slashing its pump prices to their lowest level since February – by knocking up to 2p a litre off petrol. Sainsbury’s swiftly announced its own price cut and forecourts run by oil giants were set to follow. But the AA, while welcoming the moves, warned that motorists could be paying up to 8p a litre more in towns where there is not an Asda supermaket forcing prices down. It also warned motorists that the . relief may be short-lived because of the volatility of oil and currency . fluctuations, and the actions of speculators in the market. Asda . said that drivers filling up at its 192 filling stations would pay a . maximum of 128.7p a litre for petrol and no more than 136.7p a litre for . diesel after cutting 2p off unleaded and 1p off diesel. Sainsburys swiftly followed . Asda’s lead by announcing its own 2p a litre cut on unleaded and 1p per . litre  on diesel. But the supermarket refused to say what its average . prices were by insisting it ‘priced locally’ and would be too difficult . to work out the average. However, latest forecourt fuel-price data from Experian Catalist for mid-October show Sainsbury’s average price to be 132.60p for petrol and 137.63p for diesel – against which any subsequent price cuts can be judged by consumers. Asda said a separate sample survey taken from PetrolPrices.com on November 2 shows that some retailers are getting away with charging up to 8p a litre more in towns where there is no competition from an  Asda supermarket filling station. An Asda spokesman noted: 'Asda is . unique amongst supermarkets and oil companies by setting a maximum . national price cap for its customers wherever they live – others rely on . high prices at filling stations with no local competition to fund . phoney price drops elsewhere. ‘That . clear policy is what lies behind the AA's confirmation that towns with . an Asda are likely to have Britain’s lowest petrol prices.’ The AA said prices average petrol . prices were still within 3p of the all-time record averaging 134.69p a . litre, with diesel 140.67p. In May, pump prices peaked at 137.43 for . petrol and 143.04 for diesel. Asda said its income tracker showed . transport costs continued to be the main cost pressure on households, . with UK families £15 a week worse off than they were this time last . year. High prices: The AA said average petrol prices were still within 3p of the all-time record averaging 134.69p a litre, with diesel 140.67p. In May, pump prices peaked at 137.43 for petrol and 143.04 for diesel . Jeremy Walton, Asda’s head of petrol . trading, said: ‘We’re committed to doing everything we can to help lower . the cost of living for our customers, and today’s move shows that Asda . is once again leading the way in reducing the price at the pump.” Sainsbury's said it was not part of . its ‘strategy’ to reveal its average prices to consumers. But it said: 'From tomorrow we will be cutting fuel prices in many of our stores by . up to 2p per litre.' A Sainsbury's spokesman added: ’We are doing everything we can to help our customers save money. We regularly check our prices against those of competitors to ensure we always provide customers with great value.’ Paul Watters, head of AA Public Affairs said: ‘We very much welcome Asda’s decision to pass on savings quickly. 'Unfortunately, there are many towns in . the UK that don’t have their influence and they will have to wait . significantly longer for wholesale price cuts to be passed on – and . probably not in their entirety. We hope that other retailers will take . up the challenge.’ Mr Watters added: ‘A stronger pound and drop in the value of oil have created the chance to give drivers some respite from high fuel prices – but we fear that it is temporary. 'This summer has been characterised by a series of price swings from fluctuating oil prices that reflected more the twists and turns of the euro crises than the fundamentals of supply and demand.’","Supermarket giant has knocked up to 2p a litre off petrol prices in the UK .

"By . Craig Mackenzie . Last updated at 6:49 PM on 4th November 2011 . Three-year-old Shylah Silbery had to fend for herself for two days after her mother died unexpectedly in their home in New Zealand . A three-year-old girl survived for two days on eating cheese and leftover lasagne after her mother died suddenly leaving her locked in her home. Shylah Silbery, from Wellington, New Zealand, also hugged her favourite toy - a teddy bear named Possum - as she waited alone in the house near her mother's body. She was rescued when 28-year-old Lauren Silbery's relatives alerted the authorities when they had not heard from her for two days. Police who went to the property managed to coax Shylah to drag a coffee table to the door so she could climb up and unlock it. She told them: 'Mummy won't wake up.' Lauren was found face down next to her bed. Her daughter had been able to drink milk and feed herself with whatever she could find in the fridge. Shylah spent several days in hospital recovering from dehydration and urine burns before attending her mother's funeral. The child's uncle Pete Silbery, 24, said: 'I can only imagine her in there for that long, trying to wake Mum up.' 'She's doing okay now. She's still bubbly. When we lowered the coffin into the grave at the cemetery, though, she pointed at it and said, ""Mummy's in there"". It was pretty heartbreaking.' Mr Silbery spoke every night to his sister, but he nad his mother grew so concerned after failing to reach her for two days they rang a friend who lived nearby. The friend went to the house and saw Shylah inside but no sign of her mother. The dead woman's mother, Heather, said: 'Lauren and I were very close - she would ring me every morning. 'One day I was in the garden and that afternoon at about four o'clock... her brother Peter and I said, 'Well, we haven't heard from Lauren'. Tragic: Lauren Silbery collapsed and died in her home. Police have said they do not think her death was suspicious . 'So we got a friend to go around there and [the grandchild] had come to the cat door, but Lauren hadn't, so I dialled 111.' But she said she knew her daughter was dead the instant she heard that neighbours couldn;t contact her. 'Lauren wouldn't have done anything silly,' she said. 'She loved Shylah so much and was a devoted mum. But I knew exactly what had happened. It's a mother's instinct.' She added: 'Her daughter was everything to her. She was the type of person who has a nice way of bringing people together.' Officers saw the three-year-old inside the house and taught her how to open the door by getting her to stand on a coffee table. The child's grandmother said: '[She] is still a bit quiet, but she still smiles and she's one of those kids that makes you laugh and you love to have her around. 'When we started cleaning and taking Lauren's stuff out of the flat, she did say ""Mummy won't wake up"" and when we went back in, she had shut her mother's bedroom door. 'She goes all around the flat happy, but she would not go in that room.'Mrs Silbery praised Shylah for coping so well with the traumatic experience. She said: 'Shylah doesn't quite have the spark she used to have but that will come back with time. But she still has her little sense of humour. 'We took her out for lunch and as her uncle David picked up a chip to put it in his mouth she'd grab it and eat it - then she'd laugh her little head off.' She said the fact her grand-daughter was left alone 'is what really rips into me the most ... just how resourceful my little granddaughter was. She was brilliant'. The road in Wellington, New Zealand, where the toddler was found alone but alive . The death of Ms Silbery at her house in the Upper Hutt area of the city is as yet unexplained. Police and the family believe that she died of natural causes but an investigation on behalf of the coroner has now been started. They said the fact Lauren was face down next to her bed was consistent with her having a heart attack or stroke and falling out of bed, but they said they need to wait for the results of an autopsy. They don't believe Lauren's death was suspicious. The toddler is now awaiting a Child, Youth and Family decision about whether she will be returned to her family. Shylah . was placed in CYF care after the discovery. But yesterday, central . regional director Karen Petrie said she hoped to place Shylah back with . her family. She said: . 'This is an absolutely tragic event and our sympathy goes out to this . family. Child, Youth and Family's preference in these situations is to . place children in the care of extended family members as long as this is . in the best interests of the child, and circumstances permit.' Shylah . was in regular contact with her family, and the agency was working with . them to care for Shylah's immediate needs, Ms Petrie said. Heather Silbery said her daughter had not written a will, . and confirmed her family was applying for custody of Shylah. Meanwhile, . a neighbour at the flats in Whakatiki Street, Upper Hutt, said yesterday . that in the days before the discovery silence had descended on the flat . where Shylah and her mother lived. 'Everything . had gone pretty quiet because they were normally quite a loud family, . going up and down the stairs. All of a sudden it got really quiet,' Dominic Curry, 23, said. They had recently moved into the flat, which another tenant described as having 'not that good' a community spirit.","Police alerted by Lauren Silbery's brother when he hadn't been able to contact her .

"By . Andy Dolan . Last updated at 3:40 PM on 4th November 2011 . A 72-year-old man who inherited the fortune of a partner 22 years his senior is set to lose their home and much of her cash  – because they were not married. Wheelchair-bound Leonard Taylor shared Doris Luker’s home for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died. But a court heard the ‘toy boy’, who is now seeing a 30-year-old woman, faces having to sell the semi-detached property to pay a £100,000 legal bill after losing a court battle over a £61,000 cheque Mrs Luker paid him a week before her death. 'Toy boy': Leonard Taylor shared Doris Luker's home for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died. He is set to lose the home and money he inherited because they were not married . New partner: 72-year-old Mr Taylor is now in a relationship with 30-year-old Alberta . In a case which sounds a warning to . unmarried couples, the Appeal Court was told yesterday that when Mrs . Luker died in October 2003, she left Mr Taylor her home in Birmingham, then worth £150,000, . its contents, her car and £28,000 in cash. The remainder of her estate was to be split between the British Heart Foundation and the Cancer Research Campaign. But after Mr Taylor, a retired architect who is now seeing a 30-year-old known as Alberta, had taken his portion, it emerged there was nothing left for the charities. The executor of Mrs Luker’s estate queried the cheque payment and, with the charities’ backing, launched a High Court fight to get the cash sum repaid. In . March, Judge David Cooke accepted that Mr Taylor had treated the . ‘intelligent and financially aware’ former company secretary ‘in every . way as a gentleman’, but ruled in the executor’s favour and ordered the . repayment of the cash. The . judge said Mr Taylor had a forceful personality and added that, even if . the money had been a gift, it was invalidated by ‘undue influence’. Yesterday . the pensioner - who needs a wheelchair after suffering two strokes . following his partner’s death - failed in a bid to overturn the ruling . at the Appeal Court. Charity battle: Mr Taylor shared Doris Luker's home in Birmingham for 15 years and acted as her sole carer in the three years before she died. He may now have to sell the property to cover the charities legal bills - estimated at £100,000 . Now, as well paying back the £61,000, Mr Taylor may lose his home to cover the . charities’ legal bills - estimated at £100,000 - although enforcement of . the order could be delayed until after his death. His barrister James Quirke told the London court that, had the couple been . man and wife, the venerable legal ‘presumption of advancement’ - which . assumes that cash and property transfers between close family members . are outright gifts - would have applied. But, because Mr Taylor was not . formally married to his benefactor, the opposite presumption - that the . £61,000 was a repayable loan - held sway with Judge Cooke. Mr . Quirke argued that the ‘presumption that the money was a loan applied . to strangers’ and was of ‘no application in a domestic context’. He added: ‘The judge has put the cart before the horse. No part of this presumption has any place in a domestic transaction. ‘The . payment of a cheque from one long-term co-habitee to another should not . be subject to the same assumptions as a commercial transaction. ‘He . did all, or almost all, the work in their common household and looked . after her in her illness. She made all, or almost all, the payments in . the household including substantial payments to him from time to time.’ The court heard the couple got together in 1985 when Mr Taylor was 46 and Mrs Luker was 68. He moved into her home in Hall Green, Birmingham, three years later. Ruling against Mr Taylor, Lord Justice Etherton said: ‘The law presumes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the payment of money implies an obligation to repay it. ‘The long term, loving, supporting, relationship - which Judge Cooke was perfectly willing to accept - was not sufficient in his view to explain the transaction as a gift.’ He said the High Court judge had ‘assessed the credibility of the witnesses and found on the balance of probabilities that Mrs Luker didn't intend it as an outright gift.’ Cancer Research UK legacy administration manager Sianne Kerrane said: 'We welcome the High Court’s decision to fulfil the charitable wishes of the late Doris Luker. 'Over a third of Cancer Research UK’s lifesaving work into the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of cancer is funded through gifts in Wills. 'In only a small number of cases are there any disputes and, for the most part, the family and loved ones of the deceased are happy for the contents of the will to be carried out. 'We are very grateful to Mrs Luker for choosing to remember us in her will.' Stephen Morgan, Head of Legacies Management, British Heart Foundation said: 'We are pleased the High Court had ruled in our favour and has chosen to respect the wishes of the late Doris Luker. 'We are always grateful to everyone who chooses to remember us in their will and support our work in the fight against heart disease.'","Charities win court battle for share of will .

"Former Luton South MP accused of claiming £22,500 for treating dry rot at her Southampton home . Accused of claiming £14,805 for boiler repairs and work on her conservatory . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:52 AM on 20th September 2011 . Weeping openly and with pain etched into her face, this picture shows the toll the expenses scandal has taken on former Labour MP Margaret Moran. The 56-year-old was pictured leaving Westminster Magistrates' Court earlier today with a handkerchief to her nose after an appearance in relation to her expenses. The former member for Luton South cried yesterday as she appeared in court charged with fraudulently claiming £80,000 in expenses. Showing the strain: Margaret Moran cried as she left court after hearing charges regarding her expenses. Right, the ex-MP during her time at Westminster . She is alleged to have claimed £22,500 to treat dry rot at a home in Southampton, more than 100 miles from her constituency. She is also is said to have . repeatedly ‘flipped’ her designated second home, making claims for . properties in London, Luton and Southampton over four years. Moran, who stood down at last year’s . general election, is also said to have  dishonestly claimed £4,756 for . replacement kitchen units and £14,805 for emergency heating and . conservatory repairs. She faces 15 charges of false . accounting and six of using a false instrument, which relate to her . allegedly submitting forged invoices, between November 2004 and August . 2008.

District Judge Daphne Wickham . released Moran, who lives in Southampton, on unconditional bail. She . will appear at Southwark Crown Court on October 28 for a plea and case . management hearing. The other charges she faces include . dishonestly claiming £575.78 for a washing machine, fridge and kettle . for her home in Southampton, a £2,678.76 bill for a  carpet and £527.20 . for a bed.

"By . Becky Barrow . Last updated at 8:43 AM on 6th October 2011 . House prices are plunging across England and Wales, with some regions hit by the fastest fall since records began, official figures revealed yesterday. Only London is saved from the collapse, with house prices continuing to rise sharply. The figures, from the Land Registry, highlight the ‘property apartheid’ between London and every other region of the country. Price drop: Of the 10 regions, the worst affected is the North East where prices have fallen by a fifth since the financial crisis began in 2008 . Of the ten regions, the worst affected is the North East where prices have fallen by a fifth since the financial crisis began in 2008. By comparison, prices in London, where the average home costs nearly £350,000, are close to an all-time high. Over the last year alone, prices in the area have dropped by 7.8 per cent in the North East, the biggest annual drop that the Land Registry has ever recorded in the region. The figures highlight the 'property apartheid' between London and the rest of the country. In London property prices have increased since last year by 2.1 per cent . The plunge leaves many homeowners in negative equity, which means their mortgage is larger than the current value of their property. In January 2008, the price of the average home in the North East peaked at £128,705. Today the same home is worth just £101,759. The North East is particularly affected by the Government’s austerity programme. Around one in three workers are employed by the State. And the unemployment rate is higher than anywhere else in Britain, with more than one in ten people out of work and failing to find a job. House prices have dropped by around 10 per cent - or more - in Blackburn, Blackpool, pictured, Kingston upon Hull, Hartlepool, Ceredigion and Durham . In other regions, such as Wales, the North West, West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber, house prices have fallen by at least four per cent over the last year. They have dropped by around 10 per cent – or more – in Blackburn, Blackpool, Kingston upon Hull, Hartlepool, Ceredigion and Durham. The fall is a disaster for millions of homeowners, who cannot sell their property or can only find a buyer who is prepared to pay far less than the homeowner paid. The housing market stalled last month, Nationwide's chief economist said today. The average price of a home increased by just 0.1 per cent to £166,256 from £165,914 in August. Economist Robert Gardner said prices had remained flat over the year - and were 0.3 per cent lower than September 2010. He said: 'Sluggish demand for homes on the back of weak labour market conditions, combined with only a gradual rise in the supply of available properties, has helped to keep property prices fairly stable since the summer of 2010. 'We expect this trend to be maintained over the remainder of 2011, although downside risks have increased as UK and global growth prospects have weakened.' The number of homeowners finding a buyer has halved over the last five years, according to official figures from HM Revenue and Customs. In 2006, 1.7million homes were sold. Last year, there were just 880,000 sales, leaving many trapped in homes they want to sell. Some of the worst affected are people . who have had to move for their jobs, and are being forced to rent . because they cannot sell their previous home. For . Londoners, the situation could not be more different, with prices up . 2.1 per cent over the last year, but up to 10 per cent in some areas. Experts said yesterday the property market in London is red hot with many homes selling instantly and triggering a bidding war. Liam . Bailey, head of residential research at the estate agency Knight Frank, . said: ‘London prices have soared over the past two years, but this has . not registered at all in the regions. ‘This housing wealth is not flowing beyond the M25. In fact, it is barely flowing beyond the North and South Circular.’ Peter . Rollings, chief executive of the estate agency Marsh & Parsons, . said: ‘London is a magnet for people wanting to put their money safely . in property. ‘But, if you go 30 miles out of the capital, it is a totally different story.’ Table showing the average prices per property type in England and Wales. The price of all homes are down 2.6 per cent on average . He said a two-bedroom flat in South Kensington, London was put on the market last Friday. By Tuesday, 45 different people had booked a viewing. Of the six homes sold recently by Marsh & Parsons’s office in Kensington, five were the subject of a bidding war between rival buyers. Research by Knight Frank shows about half of the homes bought in central London for more than £1million are acquired by foreigners. They are typically from Russia, the United Arab Emirates, America, France, Singapore or India. For many British people, London property has been the best place to put their money at a time when savings rates are rock bottom and the stock market has plunged.","Figures highlight 'property apartheid' between London and rest of the country .

Search: Crews led by the Dyer County Sheriff's Office have been scouring the area looking for clues in the disappearance of Karen Johnson Swift . He told the Dyersburg State Gazette: 'We are searching for anything of interest. And we are still inspecting other potential evidence, which we have recovered.' Missing: The 44-year-old has not been seen since she left a Halloween party . Friends of the woman have come forward, saying they suspect foul play because Mrs Swift would never voluntarily leave her family. Carrie Engelhardt, a friend of Swift's, told FoxNews.com: 'It’s not in her nature. We’re really concerned and worried because it’s been over a week now.'

"By . John Stevens . Last updated at 9:57 AM on 8th November 2011 . Bitter battle: Jennifer Grubb, 55, outside London's Appeal Court after she won her fight to hang on to a £4.4m divorce package . A divorcee has won her battle to hold on to a £4.4million slice of her ex-husband's ancestral fortune despite contributing nothing to their shared wealth. Jennifer Grubb, 55, was awarded a £2million nine-bedroom country house set in 40 acres of parkland, £75,000 a year for child maintenance, a £1.65million lump sum to meet her 'reasonable needs' and other assets after splitting with Anthony Arbuthnot Watkins Grubb in July 2009. A High Court judge agreed on the division of the couple's £12million estate in August, after describing the couple's wealth as 'not the product of the endeavours' of either of them. Mr Grubb, 61, a chartered surveyor, yesterday challenged the decision at the Court of Appeal, claiming he had 'arguably contributed 100 per cent' to the fortune – most of which has been in his family for years. However, yesterday the court upheld the original judgment. The ruling comes amid claims that courts have lost touch with the idea of 'reasonable needs' for wives in big-money divorce cases. Lord Justice Thorpe, sitting with Lady Justice Hallett and Sir Stephen Sedley, heard that Mrs Grubb was given Damerel, the couple's former home in North Chailey, East Sussex – and £75,000 for renovations – following the original High Court hearing. The house, set over three storeys, was described as having 'large gardens, woodlands, lakes, a tennis court and swimming pool'. The couple, who married in 1985, raised their five children there before moving to the £2million Mayes House in East Grinstead, West Sussex. Jonathan Southgate, representing Mr Grubb, attacked Mrs Grubb's award as 'exorbitant'. He described the house as 'enormous' and far beyond her 'reasonable needs' now that most of the former couple's children, aged between 15 and 30, have flown the nest. 'The word “needs” has been hollowed out and we have lost connection with it,' the barrister said. 'A nine-bedroom property of this stature was clearly over and beyond her needs.' However, Richard Anelay QC, for Mrs Grubb, argued that her ex-husband should count himself lucky to have only lost about a third of his ancestral wealth.

Aerial view of the East Grinstead home the couple moved to after leaving their nine-bedroom house in North Chailey, East Sussex. It is the North Chailey home which Mrs Grubb can hold on to following the ruling. After the hearing Mr Grubb said: 'It's a funny old system, but there you go' 'The wife's award represented less . than 50 per cent of the assets,' he told the court. 'Although Damerel is . described as nine-bedroomed, three of the rooms are very small, or . tiny.' Lord Justice Thorpe said: 'You can say . the property was so large or valuable that the judge was plainly wrong . to give it to her. That is easy to understand but difficult to succeed . on in an appeal, because it is a matter of discretion. I can see no . trace of error, or the slightest chance of succeeding on an appeal.' After the hearing, Mr Grubb said: . 'It's a funny old system, but there you go.' He inherited a vast . fortune, including several farms, a substantial shares portfolio and a . shooting estate, following the death of his father. The source of the Grubbs' wealth was a large manufacturing business, which was floated in the 1950s and sold in the 1980s. The legal costs of Mr and Mrs Grubb's divorce have been estimated at almost £700,000.","After hearing, Anthony Arbuthnot Watkins Grubb said: 'It's a funny old system, but there you go'"

Former News of the World editor . Rebekah Brooks has walked away with £1.7million and a chauffeur-driven . limousine in a controversial pay-off deal. The News International former chief . executive, who was arrested in July this year by detectives . investigating phone hacking and illegal bungs to police, has received a . bumper severance package from the newspaper group. The 43-year-old, who resigned at the . height of the phone-hacking scandal, received £1.7million in cash, the . use of a London office and a company limousine and chauffeur for two . years as part of the deal. Just days after she quit, she was arrested and is still on police bail. But News International will continue . to pay for her office in an expensive central London location for . another two years, raising suspicion that she will be allowed to return . to the firm. The controversial decision to give . her an office is likely to come under scrutiny on Thursday when James . Murdoch, the 38-year-old son of Rupert Murdoch and chairman of News . International, returns to answer questions at the Commons culture, media . and sport select committee about his knowledge of phone hacking. There have been reports that Mrs . Brooks, a favourite of Rupert Murdoch, was told she would one day be . able to return to the company, possibly in as little as two years. Mr . Murdoch is said to have told her to ‘travel the world’ until the scandal . died down. Records at Companies House show that she has now resigned from 23 directorships related to the firm. Facing questions: James Murdoch, pictured next to his father appearing before the Commons Select Committee in July, will appear before MPs again on Thursday . Labour MP Tom Watson said today: ‘It is remarkably curious that such a generous package is given to Mrs Brooks when others have been cut loose. ‘It is almost as if she hasn’t really left the company. 'I am sure Mr Murdoch will want to explain the decision to his shareholders.’ Dave Wilson, the chairman of Bell Pottinger, the public relations group hired by Mrs Brooks to deal with the fallout from her resignation, declined to comment on the confidential details of her severance package. News International also declined to comment. Mrs Brooks has been bailed to return in March next year.","Former chief executive also received chauffeur-driven limo and a London office in severance package .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:25 AM on 8th November 2011 . A loving couple who died after apparently being poisoned by their coal fire were found dead in each other's arms on their sofa. Pamela and Leslie Cox were discovered lifeless in front of the television in the front room of their home in Wickford, Essex, by their sons. It is believed that the popular couple, who had been married for 36 years, were poisoned after their coal fire developed a fault, causing smoke to gradually pour into their house. Tragic: Leslie and Pamela Cox are thought to have died from fumes given off by their coal fire . An ambulance service spokeswoman confirmed a hazardous area response team was deployed as it was thought carbon monoxide may be involved. Their devastated sons, Ian, 32 and Neil, 33, revealed today that thermal heating engineer Mr Cox had been rushed by ambulance to Basildon Hospital on Friday after feeling unwell yet was diagnosed with an ear infection. And whilst at the hospital Mrs Cox passed out but doctors allegedly said she just suffering from shock and sent the couple home. Police have launched an investigation but confirmed today that the deaths are not being treated as suspicious. Neil Cox fought back tears as he described what he and his brother were confronted with as they entered their parents terraced house yesterday morning. The thermal heating engineer said: 'We couldn't get hold of mum and dad, so we both came round and found them cuddled up together on the couch. Devastated: Leslie and Pamela Cox's sons Neil, left, and Ian found their parents dead in each other's arms on their sofa . 'The pair of them sitting there, happy together - it's as though they fell asleep together. 'There was such a strong smell when we opened the door, we just knew as we entered the property that there was something wrong. 'It was some sort of poisoning - an ambulance took my dad to hospital on Friday evening and then mum collapsed in the hospital but all they did was check her blood pressure and said ""you are fine""  and said to dad he had an ear infection and sent them home. 'Obviously Basildon Hospital is not doing its job properly are they? I am sorry but for two people to be in at the same time like that and then be sent home, there is something wrong. 'Something has been missed - if they had checked them properly, then they would still be here now. 'They said they felt like they had a hangover even though they had not been drinking.' Under attack: Pamela and Leslie Cox's sons have said they believe Basildon Hospital did not do its job properly when dealing with their parents . And his brother, Ian, is appealing for people to check their appliances to prevent further tragedies happening: . 'I just want everyone to be careful, to have alarms because it is such a tragedy that we have lost our mum and dad.' The sons said their popular parents had been planning their retirement and loved spending time at their caravan at Clacton. Ian added: 'We will remember them as smiling and with a drink in their hand - that's how they were in life and they left it smiling. 'They have left behind three grandchildren, it's just a tragedy. They were the best two people in the world. 'Mum would do anything for anyone, she was that sort of person and dad was a ""happy go lucky"" guy - he was our football manager when we were lads. 'Mum was always putting others before themselves, they were just enjoying life and looking forward to retiring to Clacton. 'We are taking strength from the fact that they were together and that it was peaceful. 'The television was on, the lights were on - it was as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened.' Essex Police this morning confirmed that they are treating the deaths as 'unexplained' at this stage. A spokesman said: 'The deaths are not being treated as suspicious but the home is being preserved for a detailed examination to try to establish the circumstances surrounding the deaths.' A police community support officer remains outside the £200,000 terraced house which has been taped off as investigations continue. Post mortems into the deaths are set to take place later this week.","Devastated sons find their parents dead in house .

"X Factor back on top in ratings war after Saturday's live show beats Strictly Come Dancing . By . Emily Sheridan . Last updated at 3:02 PM on 7th November 2011 . It was a big shock in The X Factor with show favourites The Risk and Johnny Robinson being voted off in a double elimination. Flamboyant Robinson was voted off after going head-to-head in a sing-off with fellow Over-25s act Kitty Brucknell. And surprisingly, Brighton wildboy Frankie Cocozza managed to stay another week, despite his panned performance on Saturday night. Farewell: Johnny Robinson puts on a brave face with his former mentor Louis Walsh . Game over: Charlie Healy and Derry Mensah of The Risk leave the X Factor studios for the final time . His mentor Louis was forced to choose between Robinson and Brucknell, admitting he thought the blonde singer was more likely to get a recording act. After it was announced that Robinson was going home, both Walsh and Gary Barlow shed a tear for the popular finalist. Choosing between his acts, Walsh said: 'They've . been incredible to work with. They were both incredible in the sing-off. I have to pick the person who I think in the real world who would get a . recording act and the act I'm gonna have to send home is Johnny.' Decision time: Johnny Robinson was voted off after a sing-off with Kitty Brucknell . Shock factor: The Risk (L-R) Charlie Healy, Andrew Merry, Ashford Campbell and Derry Mensah were the first to leave . Joining Robinson on stage, who appeared to accept his fate with good humour, Walsh added: 'This guy is a brilliant singer, he's a great character, he's gonna have a great career. I hate to see him go home.' Robinson said: 'I wanna thank everyone who have got behind me. All the judges, everyone out there in the UK who accepted me for just being me.' Unemployed Robinson, 45, sang The Righteous Brothers' Unchained Melody, while Brucknell, 26, sang Kelly Clarkson's Beautiful Disaster. Our acts have gone: Both mentors Louis Walsh and Tulisa Contostavlos were visibly upset . Farewell: Brucknell embraces Robinson after finding out he's going home . After the sing-off Tulisa said: 'I . get along with both of you really well. I've got to go with the act that . I look forward to watching perform each week so the act I'm sending . home this week is Johnny.' Kelly lamented: 'The act that I'm looking to that is gonna provide us with something more in the competition is Johnny.' Although . Rowland's decision cemented Robinson's departure, Barlow added: 'Johnny . is one of the nicest people in this competition.' Tough decision: Kelly Rowland chose Johnny, but Gary Barlow got emotional when he praised the singer's lovely character . While the pair fought for survival in a sing-off, boy band The Risk were eliminated straightaway after receiving lowest vote. The Risk's exit came as a shock as only a week ago they were second favourite to win the show by the bookies. But perhaps their recent change of line-up after Ashford Campbell, 16, replaced Ashley Baptiste may have affected their chances. Singing for survival: Brucknell sang   Kelly . Clarkson's Beautiful Disaster while Robinson belted out The Righteous . Brothers' Unchained Melody . Group hug: Tulisa commiserates with The Risk after they hear they are heading home . Marcus Collins: 9/4 . Janet Devlin: 3/1 . Craig Colton: 7/2 . Misha B: 9/2 . Little Mix: 7/1 . Kitty Brucknell: 40/1 . Frankie Cocozza: 50/1 . (Ladbrokes) When . asked how they felt by Dermot O'Leary, The Risk singer Derry Mensah . said: 'I dunno what is it. I'm just happy we're here together.' Charlie . Healy added: 'We're The Risk, we're just gonna carry on,' while . bandmate Andrew Merry said: 'It's been a honour to sing with these . guys.' Tulisa's girl band . Little Mix were the first to find out they were through until next week, . followed by the new bookies favourite Marcus Collins. Despite landing in the bottom two last week, Manchester singer Misha B was thrilled to find out she was safe for another week. There was shock when Cocozza got through, with the singer evidently surprised he had managed to survive another week after his performance of The Black Eyed Peas' I Gotta Feeling the previous night. Surviving another week: Frankie Cocozza - the bookies' favourite to leave the show this weekend - amazingly stayed . Meanwhile, . X Factor alumni JLS and Florence And The Machines performed their . latest singles Take A Chance and No Light, No Light. The results show comes after X Factor managed to beat Strictly Come Dancing in the ratings war on Saturday night. A peak of 11million tuned in to watch the Club Classics-themed week on X Factor, compared to 10.5million with Strictly on BBC. And then there was one: Tulisa's sole remaining act Little Mix were first to find out they were through to next week .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:11 PM on 8th November 2011 . Greek party leaders were today struggling to agree on who will become the country's new prime minister - as they came under increasing pressure from the EU to push through a bailout to save the country's finances and end the chaos threatening the euro. After early signs that agreement on a new national unity coalition could be reached quickly, the drive by the socialist and conservative parties to create a government that will rule only until February appeared to be losing momentum. Monday came and went without any accord on who will lead the coalition, despite former vice president of the European Central Bank, Lucas Papademos, emerging as a frontrunner. Embattled: Greece's Prime Minister George Papandreou is struggling to agree who will be his replacement . President Papoulias (right) welcomes the Mr Papandreou at the beginning of their hour-long meeting . Socialist Prime Minister George Papandreou and conservative party head Antonis Samaras have been wrangling over who will lead an interim government that aims primarily to secure a new 130 billion euro European rescue package, agreed less than two weeks ago. The rivals reached a landmark agreement late on Sunday for Papandreou to step down and the temporary government to be formed. European Ombudsman Nikiforos Diamantouros is also being touted a potential leader. The coalition deal was an effort to calm a political crisis that erupted last week after Papandreou announced plans to put the new debt deal to a referendum. He withdrew the plan on Thursday following anger from European leaders, an open revolt from within his Socialist party and turmoil in the financial markets. Opposition leader Antonis Samaras snubbed the idea of a coalition government insisting what Greece needs is 'immediate elections' Papandreou, half way through his four-year term, has said he will step down after a power-sharing deal is reached. An agreement on who will lead the new government had been expected yesterday, but telephone negotiations between Papandreou and Samaras had produced no public announcement by this morning. Some officials said a result might come before a Cabinet meeting Papandreou was to chair at 12noon today. The wrangling comes amid intense pressure from Europe. Jean-Claude Juncker, the chairman of the eurozone’s finance ministers, said yesterday that the leaders of the two main parties must co-sign a letter reaffirming their commitment to Greece’s bailouts and economic reforms before the next batch of bailout cash is handed over to Athens. EU Monetary Affairs Commissioner Olli Rehn said Greece can receive the next 8 billion euro slice of its first bailout in November, if both parties commit to the bailout program. Without the funds, Greece will default before Christmas. After Papandreou’s referendum announcement, the country’s international creditors froze the critical instalment. Turmoil: Greece's government is in chaos as it tries to create a coalition . Frustrated with the political turmoil in Greece, they have maintained the pressure even after the public vote idea was officially cancelled. Greece has survived since May 2010 on a (euro) 110 billion ($150 billion) rescue-loan program from its eurozone partners and the International Monetary Fund, but all agree it’s not enough. A second rescue package has been created which involves private bondholders who have agreed to cancel 50 percent of their Greek debt. Greece has endured 20 months of punishing austerity measures in exchange for the international rescue loans. The efforts by Papandreou’s government to keep the country solvent have prompted violent protests, crippling strikes and a sharp decline in living standards for most Greeks. The EU has been accused of carrying . out a coup d’etat in Greece, after the head of the European Commission . also threatened the country with ‘paralysis’ unless MPs removed their prime . minister.# . Chaos: Riot police in Athens help a fellow officer whose clothing caught fire after being hit by a petrol bomb . Explosive: Union protesters run from a fore bomb hurled towards them in Athens as clashes from the general strike turned violent . Jose Manuel Barroso, the EC . president, had warned that Greece would not get its next payment from . the EU and International Monetary Fund unless Mr Papandreou was toppled. EU leaders were horrified that Mr . Papandreou said a referendum should be held to approve a 100billion euro . bailout deal, which will result in a decade of tax rises and spending . cuts. German politician Peter Altmaier . insisted that Greece’s future in the eurozone would depend on the . implementation of long-term economic reforms. ‘We have made it clear we want to . preserve the euro,’ the deputy parliamentary leader of Chancellor Angela . Merkel’s Christian Democrats said. ‘At the final stage, it depends what . happens inside Greece.’ Meanwhile, Joachim Fels, of Morgan . Stanley Research, warned that the admission by EU leaders that countries . could leave out of the eurozone threatened even more turmoil. ‘Chancellor Merkel and [French . president Nicolas] Sarkozy, in response to the idea of a Greek . referendum on the bailout package, raised the possibility of a country . leaving the euro – so far a taboo in European political circles,’ he . said in a note to investors. ‘By raising the possibility that a . country might leave the euro, core European governments may have set in . motion a sequence of events which could potentially lead to runs on . sovereigns and banks in peripheral countries that make everything we . have seen so far in this crisis look benign.’","Leaders struggle to agree on who will become new prime minister .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 3:06 PM on 7th November 2011 . Missing: Atiya Anjum Wilkinson whose fifth birthday it is today has been missing for two years . A father who abducted his five-year-old daughter has been jailed after refusing to reveal her whereabouts. Atiya Anjun-Wilkinson who turns five today went missing during a trip to the seaside two years ago on her third birthday, High Court judges have heard during private hearings in London. She was at first thought to be in Pakistan but relatives fear she could now be in Iran. The girl's mother, Gemma Wilkinson, 32, from Ashton-under-Lyne, Greater Manchester has not seen her daughter since. Atiya's father - former insurance salesman Razwan Ali Anjum, 27, is in prison for contempt of court several times. He has repeatedly refused to comply with a court order and reveal Atiya's whereabouts, judges have heard. Lawyers representing Ms Wilkinson are today appealing for help in finding a four-year-old girl abducted by her father after a senior judge lifted a publicity ban that had prevented the case from being reported previously. One judge described the case as 'as bad a case of child abduction as I have encountered'. Details of the case emerged in August at a public Court of Appeal hearing in London - where Anjum, also of Ashton-under-Lyne, failed to persuade three appeal judges to rule that he had been unfairly jailed for contempt. Anjum argued that repeated prison sentences for contempt of court were unfair and served no purpose. Separated: Anjum, left, and Ms Wilkinson, right, had an 'on-off' relationship split-up before Atiya was born . However Lord Justice McFarlane, Lord Justice Hughes and Lord Justice Tomlinson, disagreed and dismissed Anjum's appeal. The judges also decided that Atiya should not be identified. But several few days ago, Lord Justice Hughes lifted the publicity ban and allowed for Atiya's name and photograph to be published in order that it might help find the little girl. In court, Anjum hinted that his daughter, Atiya might be living in Tehran, Iran with a former girldfriend who also cares for his son from a previous relationship. Solicitor Matthew Lord, of law firm Pluck Andrew & Co - which has an office in Ashton-under-Lyne said: 'The father has said she is now in Iran but she could well be in the UK - she could be anywhere. 'We think that one possibility is that she is in the Huddersfield area of West Yorkshire. 'We would urge people to look at her photograph and think very carefully if they might have seen her - maybe living nearby.' Following Anjum's failed appeal in . August, Lord Justice McFarlane said it was 'impossible to underestimate' the impact that the 'continued limbo' was having on Ms Wilkinson. Ruling: Three judges at the High Court (pictured) who jailed Anjum for contempt of court several times said he would be released in April . The girl's mother told the Metro: 'With the lack of information, you just imagine the worst. 'I've had no contact with her. It must be so scary for her'. Lord . Justice McFarlane said in August: 'This four-year-old girl has now not . seen either of her parents for a period fast approaching two years. 'She is fast growing up with no knowledge of or relationship with either her mother of father. 'The way forward is in her father's own hands and for the child's sake I earnestly hope he will now change from the highly abusive course he has hitherto been set upon.' Appeal judges heard that Anjum's 'on-off' relationship with Ms Wilkinson ended in 2008. The couple had met in 2003 while on the same course at Oldham Business Management School. Ms Wilkinson later fell pregnant and they split-up before Atiya was born. On her third birthday, Anjum took his daughter on a trip Southport, Lancashire and phoned Ms Wilkinson to tell her Atiya was in Pakistan and that she was 'never going to see Atiya again,' judges heard. Anjum had referred to Ms Wilkinson as 'only or merely her birth mother', judges heard. Lawyers said Anjum had been jailed for contempt - by judges sitting in the Family Division of the High Court - in 2010, then again in April 2011, then again in October 2011. They said he was due for release in April next year.","Five-year-old went missing on her third birthday during trip to Southport, Lancashire .

"She even serves it at dinner parties . By . Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 2:25 PM on 8th November 2011 . As a professional artist and taxidermist Alison Brierley is used to handling roadkill. But now rather than making jewellery from the hides of dead animals she finds, since becoming pregnant Ms Brierley has found a new use for the animals. Ms Brierley, from Harrogate, North Yorkshire, has developed strong cravings for roadkill meat. Unusual entrées: Pregnant Alison Brierley sits at her dinner table alongside Japanese Gyoto dubbed Feral Fusion after it was made with roadkill due to her cravings . She said: ‘Usually I eat really healthily but now I'm pregnant I get strong cravings for roadkill. ‘It's more gamey than other meat and I love the taste. ‘I also don't have to feel guilty about eating it because I know it's had a completely free range and natural life. ‘Because I'm pregnant I've been extra careful when handling the carcasses and I always wear gloves. I don't want to risk any infections that could hurt the baby.’ Ms Brierley, 42, and her partner Marcus Speer, 44, are thrilled to be having a baby boy, which is due in February. Unusual cravings: The professional artist and taxidermist has been craving roadkill since becoming pregnant (pictured here picking up dinner from a road in Yorkshire) Cooking up a storm: Alison in her kitchen in Harrogate creating the Japanese Gyoto made from road kill . Although the nomadic couple have eaten roadkill before, and admitted to trying venison on a recent trip to America, Ms Brierley says that her extreme cravings have only been brought on by the pregnancy. She said: ‘I'm craving junk food which is really unlike me and I am eating a lot more roadkill and red meat in general. ‘It's probably because I need all the natural iron I can get at the moment, what with all these extra red blood cells I am making.’ Ms Brierley revealed how she has even started hosting regular roadkill dinner parties, which she says are thoroughly enjoyed by her friends. She said: ‘They trust me and they know I'm a good cook so I think they love it. ‘I get the best meat from friends who ring me up to tell me about a kill they've spotted on their way to work. Eating for two: Alison says she needs all the natural iron she can get at the moment, because of the extra red blood cells she's making while pregnant . ‘The best road round here is the A61 to Ripon, it's definitely the most fruitful. ‘But most of my foraging is opportunistic and I don't go out looking for carcasses. ‘The first time I picked something up was when I drove past a perfectly good pheasant. ‘I stopped and I thought 'I'm going to eat this'. ‘I took it home and marinated it in olive oil for four days before I made a kind of Kentucky fried pheasant dish. ‘I've also tried  hare, deer, pigeon, rabbit, owls and partridges, but pheasant is still the staple because it's so common. ‘I would like to try fox and badger but they're never in good enough condition to eat; although I have used them for my artwork.’ Despite their controversial lifestyle choice Ms Brierley and Mr Speer believe that their way of life is better for the environment. ‘One of the big reasons for being public about this is that I want to raise awareness about where food actually comes from’, said Alison. ‘Some people are so blasé about picking their food off a supermarket shelf without giving a thought to how it lived or how it was killed.’","Alison Brierley is a professional taxidermist .

"By . James Chapman and Nick Pisa . Last updated at 8:50 AM on 8th November 2011 . Praying for salvation? Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi resorted to Facebook . Silvio Berlusconi logged on to Facebook yesterday to insist he will not quit as Italian prime minister. Rumours swirled around Rome that the billionaire was about to yield to pressure from EU leaders for a coalition government to step in to embrace tough austerity measures. Brussels is accused of masterminding 'coups d'etat' to keep the single currency together, with Greek leader George Papandreou having been seen off after he proposed giving his people a vote on an EU bailout package. There are growing fears that debt contagion is spreading across the Continent, threatening to engulf Italy's economy and sending shockwaves across Europe. Mr Berlusconi, who is facing a crunch budget vote in the Italian parliament this afternoon, went online to say he was staying where he was. The 75-year-old wrote: 'Reports of my resignation are completely unfounded and I don't know where they have come from.' He took to the social network site after leaving the Italian capital for a 'prearranged appointment', which turned out to be a meeting with members of his family at their luxury villa at Arcore near Milan – the venue for his infamous 'bunga bunga' sex parties. Last night, Mr Berlusconi added another comment to his Facebook page, saying: 'Let's go forward, we must be ready to fight because if there were an unelected left-wing revolution against the government that would be the opposite of democracy.' As dozens of government MPs threatened to defect, the Italian leader told the centre-right newspaper Libero that those who abandoned him were traitors. 'I'll propose a confidence vote. I want to see who tries to betray me,' he declared. Earlier, Giuliano Ferrara, editor of the newspaper Il Foglio and a close friend of Mr Berlusconi, said the leader was on the brink: 'The fact that Berlusconi is about to step down is given as read, it is just a question of time, maybe even minutes.' Dismissed: Silvio Berlusconi took to Facebook to deny the rumours that he was about to quit . German Chancellor Angela Merkel (left) and France's President Nicolas Sarkozy share a joke at the EU summit in Brussels on October 23 . Last days of Rome? Silvio Berlusconi (left) has been hit by the defection of Gabriela Carlucci (right) Italy is the third biggest economy in . the eurozone and its political woes and debt worries are seen as a huge . threat in the wider crisis facing the single currency. Berlusconi's latest assurance over . his majority may be bad news for Italian bonds, which sold off again on . Friday to push their yield to a record euro-era high above 6.4 per . cent. It demonstrated that investors were steering clear of lending to the debt-plagued nation and increasing the likelihood of Silvio Berlusconi accepting a bail-out . He is currently under intense external pressure to . end months of procrastination over structural reforms and measures to . cut Italy's 1,900billion euro public debt. The spread over . German bunds, reflecting the higher risk premium investors place on . Italy, also hit a record above 4.6 percentage points. Bond . prices would recover and the yield spread would fall by a full . percentage point if the government should fall, according to a Reuters . survey of 10 fund managers, market analysts and strategists last week. Economy . Minister Giulio Tremonti was forced to deny reports that he had . forecast a 'catastrophe' on financial markets next week unless . Berlusconi stepped down. European . Central Bank council member Yves Mersch underscored Italy's high stakes . on Sunday, saying the ECB frequently debates the option of ending . its purchases of Italian bonds unless Rome delivers on reforms. Without that bond-buying program, the run on Italian bonds would probably already have spiralled way out of control. Rebel MPs have threatened to desert . him in large numbers in this afternoon's vote on Italy's accounts for . last year – an occasion which should be routine but is being seen as a . crucial test of his strength. Mr . Berlusconi, who is his country's longest-serving post-war leader, is . said to have the support of only around 300 out of 630 MPs, and if he is . defeated it is very likely he will resign. Fresh elections would be . held in January, a year earlier than planned. EU leaders are determined to have a . technocratic government in Rome, just as they have done in Athens, . despite growing unease about the implications for democracy and the . concept of sovereign nation states. Mr Berlusconi has already been forced . to accept that officials from the International Monetary Fund and the EU . will be drafted in to oversee the chaotic public finances. However, the think tank Open Europe . said in a report Italy will need at least £700billion over the next . three years just to stand still. Yesterday the nation's borrowing costs soared to their highest level since the euro was created. The yield, or interest rate, on . ten-year Italian government bonds leapt to a punishing 6.66 per cent. Economists say 7 per cent would make a bailout unavoidable.

Russia, holder of the world's third largest forex reserves, today delivered a vote of no confidence in Europe's approach to resolving its sovereign debt crisis. It came as the head of the International Monetary Fund visited Moscow to seek support. Without directly referring to the eurozone's bailout fund, foreign minister Sergei Lavrov made it clear Russia would not be willing to lend directly to it, preferring to channel any support through the IMF. He added that this was the joint position of the so-called BRICS caucus of emerging markets nations that have accumulated trillions of dollars in foreign reserves to insure against external shocks. He told a press conference: 'Our countries are ready to take part in joint efforts, including the provision of credits, under those rules and channels that exist in the International Monetary Fund.' Lavrov said that, in return for financial assistance, emerging markets wanted earlier agreements on 'deep reform' to the IMF and the global financial system to be implemented. Lavrov spoke before Christine Lagarde, making her first visit to Moscow since taking over as managing director of the Fund, met President Dmitry Medvedev at the Kremlin. Medvedev made no substantial comment at a photo-opportunity with Lagarde, who also made no comment. She was due to give a speech later today, meet Finance Ministry and central bank officials, and hold a news conference tomorrow. It was not clear whether Lagarde would meet Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, the senior partner in Russia's ruling 'tandem' who has announced he will run for the presidency next year. Putin was hosting a meeting of a regional security group in St Petersburg attended by Chinese Prime Minister Wen Jiabao.","Berlusconi faces crunch budget vote today .

"By . Ian Drury . Last updated at 12:47 PM on 8th November 2011 . Lord Dannatt, the ex-Chief of the General Staff, says that society could learn lessons from the military . Britain has lost its ‘moral compass’ and should look to the conduct of the Armed Forces to instill proper standards of decency, the former head of the Army argues today. A series of scandals that have rocked the country are evidence people in the UK are struggling to differentiate between right and wrong, warns General Lord Richard Dannatt. They include MPs shamelessly milking their . taxpayer-funded expenses, phone hacking, bankers paying themselves . obscene bonuses and the summer riots, he will explain. But in a lecture tonight Lord Dannatt, the ex-Chief of the General Staff, says that society could learn lessons from the military. He says the Armed Forces today place as much importance on teaching recruits moral and mental strength as it does on physical training. He says: ‘In past generations, it was often assumed that young men and women coming into the Armed Forces would have absorbed an understanding of the core values and standards of behaviour required by the military from their family or from within their wider community… I would suggest such a presumption cannot be made today. ‘Given that much of our society is pretty unstructured these days, and given that the military has the unique opportunity to educate its own into the importance of a proper moral understanding, then perhaps the military community may have a wider contribution that it can make to the nation.’ A country losing its way? A furniture shop burns in Croydon, south London on the third night of rioting in August . Lord Dannatt’s remarks will spark controversy because the Army has recently been blasted for abusing prisoners in Iraq. 'In past generations, it was . often assumed that young men and women coming into the Armed Forces . would have absorbed an understanding of the core values and standards of . behaviour required by the military from their family or from within . their wider community… I would suggest such a presumption cannot be made . today' Sir William Gage’s inquiry into the death of hotel receptionist Baha Mousa, who suffered more than 90 injuries after he was arrested as a terror suspect by British troops in Basra in 2003, found he had been beaten and tortured. The British Army insists the abuse was not endemic and merely a case of a handful of rogue soldiers. Lord Dannatt, speaking at the social think-tank Theos’ Annual Lecture tonight, will call these cases 'unforgivable' and say: 'All our soldiers must know that collectively and individually, we can, and should, and will be called to account when things go wrong.' He will say that the moral and even the spiritual dimensions are as crucial as the strategic and operational dimensions of warfare, and essential for winning wars. Moral training can make it possible for soldiers to show loyalty and integrity, and even to 'kill and show compassion at the same time,’ he will say. General Lord Dannatt will argue that leaders both in the army and across society need a better understanding of the moral and spiritual dimension to both war and all of life. Elizabeth Hunter, director of Theos, said: 'Following moral scandals across politics, journalism and banking, and the shock of the summer riots, Lord Dannatt is offering a way forward for rebuilding a society based on values and virtues.'","Armed Forces place as much importance on teaching morals as physical training, says Lord Dannatt .

Marks & Spencer posted a drop in profits for the first time in two years today after it opted not to pass on the full extent of rising costs to cash-strapped shoppers. They reported a half-year pre-tax profit of £320.5million - down eight per cent on the previous six-month period. Hot weather in September and . October hampered a depressed clothing market by causing . shoppers to postpone buying autumn and winter ranges. Fall: M&S announced profits were down eight per cent at £320.5million as its half-year results were published today . The store has launched a . high-profile tie up with X-Factor in recent weeks as it tries to . tempt consumers to part with their money in the run-up to Christmas. M&S shares opened up four per cent because the results were in line with forecasts - and the company said the second half of its financial year was going as expected. Chief executive Marc Bolland said it had cut prices and focused on offering better value to shoppers at a time when household finances were being squeezed. The strategy came despite the company facing higher commodity costs, particularly in clothing. Mr Bolland added that he remained cautious about the outlook but said the chain was 'well set up' for the Christmas period. The 127-year-old group, seen as a high street bellwether, made £348.6million in the previous 26 week period between October last year and April. Although profits were down for the 26 weeks to October 1 this year, it has launched more than 900 new lines and rolled out promotional offers. The chain, which operates from 700 . stores, has been hit by the huge number of promotions on offer at both . its supermarket and fashion rivals, which has seen its profit margins . squeezed as it tries to compete. It started its summer sale two weeks early this year, in line with the . rest of the high street. Sales in British stores fell 0.7 per cent in the last quarter, with a 2.5 per cent drop in general merchandise sales. Christmas campaign: M&S has linked up with the X-Factor finalists for a Christmas advert which was screened for the first time last weekend . M&S recently announced a £600million revamp that it hopes will make its outlets easier to shop in and . boost sales of its own brands. The stores will include 'shops within . shops' for each of its brands, such as Per Una, Limited Collection and . Autograph, with each benefiting from their own distinctive backdrops. It . comes after shoppers complained the stores were difficult to shop in. New-look outlets include delicatessens and bakeries on site, while Mr Bolland will relaunch in France within the next few weeks. M&S shares have fallen 18 per cent over the past six months, against an eight per cent dip for the wider FTSE 100 Index. Cheer: M&S hopes the X-Factor tie-up will boost its figures after a dismal summer for retailers . Rising inflation has hit shoppers’ pockets, leading to a wave of dismal figures from the High Street last week. Next said store sales were down eight per cent in the three months to the end of October on a like-for-like basis. Even fast-growing online retailer Asos has warned that there will be heavy discounting by clothing retailers in the run-up to Christmas. At the height of the recession two years ago M&S was forced to close 27 stores - costing 1,230 jobs - as it brought in cost-cutting measures. Sales figures were down 7.1 per cent in the run-up to Christmas in 2008. M&S link-up with X-Factor for Christmas advert - Video .","Shares UP 4% as results were in line with forecasts .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:43 AM on 8th November 2011 . Councils should be allowed to close down betting shops which are 'blighting' traditional high streets, local authority officials have argued. Regional government officials have warned that attempts to keep betting shops away from Britain's town centres have stalled due to complex and expensive planning rules. The Local Government Association will today warn MPs that some areas of London currently have as many as eight bookmakers on a single street. The rise in betting shops has made them a 'blight' on Britain's high streets, according to local government officials . The rise of betting shops in British towns has led to increased crime and higher policing costs, according to the Daily Telegraph. But councils are finding it more and more difficult closing down shops which 'cause misery for local people'. David Parsons, chairman of the LGA's environment and housing board, told the Daily Telegraph: 'The Government must give councils new powers to stop betting shops setting up if they are likely to cause a public nuisance. Warning: David Parsons, from the Local Government Association, said the rise of betting shops has increased policing costs and health problems . 'At the moment, numbers cannot be restricted and this results in crime, disorder and misery for local people. 'We are seeing a reckless gamble with our high streets which is contributing to higher policing and health costs, in addition to reducing the quality of life for local residents.' The LGA is expected to make its comments to MPs on the culture, media and sport comittee, which is currently investigating whether current laws are effective enough in protecting children from the harmful effects of gambling. Dirk Vennix, a spokesperson for the Association of British Bookmakers, said it was important to study the evidence linked to gambling, adding that betting shops have only become an issue for 'a handful of councils'.","More bookmakers 'lead to increased policing and health costs'

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 3:33 PM on 7th November 2011 . A leading cancer specialist hospital is in crisis after staff made four major patient blunders in just six weeks. Surgical items were left inside two patients, while a third case involved 'wrong site surgery' - where surgeons operated via an incorrect route into the body. In a fourth error the wrong implant was fitted inside a patient. Addenbrooke's Hospital: Four patients suffered due to staff blunders over the last six weeks. However none has come to 'permanent harm' The multiple blunders at Addenbrooke's Hospital in Cambridgeshire are known as 'never' events in the NHS because they are never supposed to happen. A Cambridge University Hospitals . spokesman said: 'We deeply regret these incidents and have apologised to . the four patients. Fortunately none of them came to any permanent harm. The Cambridge hospital has 1,000 beds and 7,000 staff. Between 2010 and 2011 there were 458,141 visits to outpatients and 115,844 day cases. The hospital admitted 67,787 patients and dealt with 93,523 cases in A&E. The hospital has an income of £577m and 33 operating theatres. There are five intensive care units and 40 wards. 'This hospital has one of the best . records in the NHS for patient safety - but we are investigating and . will learn from these events. 'We have already taken action to minimise the risk of them happening again.' The spokesman added that no more information would be given due to patient confidentiality. The medical director Dr Jag Ahluwalia . sent an email to staff reminding them that the standard of patient . safety should be '100 per cent.' NHS chiefs will be holding an urgent meeting in the next few days to discuss why the events took place and how to prevent them happening in the future. Peter Walsh from Action Against Medical Accidents, said: 'They aren't called 'never events' for nothing. There are basic safety checks in place to avoid this type of thing. There can be no excuse.' Diane Abbott MP, the Shadow Public Health Minister, said: 'Andrew Lansley is so out of touch, he’s oblivious to the damage being done to the hospitals in his own constituency, let alone the rest of the country. 'They have boasted about increasing NHS spending when in fact they have cut it in real terms.' Addenbrooke's is an internationally renowned teaching hospital and is a leader in both neurological care and liver and bone marrow transplants. The Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute is based within the hospital complex.","Other errors include wrong implant fitted and 'wrong site surgery'

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:14 AM on 8th November 2011 . Bringing in the old: Chris Moyles has seen the average age of listeners of his Radio 1 breakfast show rise to 33 . It is supposed to be the radio station for the nation's youth. But the age of the average Radio 1 listener is actually 32, according to research, up from 29 three years ago. And the audience for the breakfast show presented by 37-year-old Chris Moyles is even older, at an average age of 33. The BBC station infamously lost long-running presenters including Simon Bates and Dave Lee Travis in the 1990s to try to become 'trendy' again. Its target audience now is 15- to 29-year-olds. Yet the station has almost 2.5million listeners aged 45 and over, according to the analysis from commercial rival GMG Radio, owner of Smooth Radio. Moyles has seen his 15- to 24-year-old audience fall by 7 per cent in three years while his 45- to 54-year-old listenership has increased 23 per cent to 854,000, according to GMG Radio. Radio 1 had an average weekly reach of 11.85million listeners in the three months to September 18, according to official Rajar figures. This was its highest quarterly listening figures since 1999. But Moyles lost more than 250,000 listeners on the previous quarter, down to 7.16million. The analysis comes despite repeated calls by the BBC Trust for Radio 1 executives to refocus the station towards a younger audience. It also represents a dilemma for new controller Ben Cooper, who took over last month following the exit of long-standing chief Andy Parfitt in the summer. GMG Radio chief executive Stuart Taylor said: 'My message to Ben Cooper would be: You have got the job, now bring the station into line. What are you going to do to meet the trust's clear instructions?' In 2009, the station was told in a BBC Trust review to refocus its schedule on winning more younger listeners. At the time, it was also reported that Radio 1 executives privately believed some of their DJs were too old. Older but wiser: There has been talk of bringing in younger DJs to present Radio 1 shows but 36-year-old Sara Cox (left) still remains. Vernon Kay (right) is another presenter who is in his late 30s and attracts older people to the station . No change in five years: The average listener of the Radio 2 breakfast show is 51 despite Chris Evans replacing Sir Terry Wogan last year . The concerns were repeated in the . BBC's annual report this year, in which the Trust said it would . 'continue to challenge [BBC management] to ensure that Radio 1 focuses . more clearly on younger listeners'. Mr . Taylor said: 'Why not redesign Radio 1 around 15 to 29-year-olds? If . you started again from scratch you wouldn't have what they do now.' A . BBC spokesman said: 'Radio 1's young audience has actually increased . and now reaches 3.7million 15- to 24-year-olds. Share of listening among . this age group has also risen and the station now reaches 45 per cent . of all 15- to 24-year-olds in the UK. 'Radio 1 and 1Xtra both have a strong . editorial strategy for continuing the focus on attracting a younger . audience. 'This includes programming like Radio 1's Teen Awards, Radio . 1's Big Conversation, 1Xtra under 18s night and the Radio 1 Student . tour.' Despite Radio 1's ageing audience, the average listener to its sister station Radio 2 is still significantly older. The average age of a Radio 2 listener is 51, as it has been for more than five years.","Rises to 33 for breakfast show presented by Chris Moyles (aged 37)

Last updated at 5:26 PM on 8th November 2011 . It's been less than a week since they had a public bust up over Mark Wright but last night Lauren Goodger and Sam Faiers came face-to-face once again. The Only Way Is Essex stars were both walking the green carpet at the Call Of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 launch party but appeared to steer well clear of one another. The pair joined a host of D-listers at the London party including their fellow TV stars, Lauren Pope and Mario Falcone. Hands on hips: Lauren Goodger (L) came face-to-face with Sam Faiers for the first time since their bust up at Chloe Sims birthday party last week . Supportive sister: Sam was lucky to have her older sibling Billie there with her . The reunion comes after Lauren, 25, spoke exclusively to Star magazine this week saying she feels as though Sam has 'stabbed' her in the back. 'She disgusts me,' said Lauren. 'I know Mark wasn’t an angel in our relationship, but I’ve never actually seen him with another girl in front of my face. That was just awful.' 'I’m really p****d off,' she said of Sam, 20. 'It’s really unfair. What’s the need for it? 'She’s hurt me loads. Right now it’s really awkward - I can’t text her or go to Minnies. She’s hurt me more than Mark. She knew I was there in the woods - so how could she kiss Mark when he’d been looking at me all day and bantering back and forth?' The dramatic scenes took place at . Chloe Sim's wedding themed birthday party last week and saw Lauren . publicly have a go at Sam and call her 'desperate.' Cat fight: Lauren and Sam had an argument after she spotted Sam kissing her ex-boyfriend Mark Wright . Whose side were you on during the TOWIE catfight? But she looked far from angry as she posed for photographs last night in a black sleeved dress. Wearing a bright red waist belt with . patent platform heels, the reality TV star showed off her shiny tanned . legs and wore her long blonde hair in loose curls. Her . fellow bridesmaid, Lauren Pope, looked just as glammed up in a green Celeb Boutique . bodycon dress and peep-toe heels and also wore her hair in a loose wave. And fellow TOWIE star, Maria Fowler also dressed up for the event wearing a short leopard-print dress from online brand, ForeverUnique.co.uk. But Sam did her best to out-do the girls by showing off her cleavage in a black lace top. Teaming . it with a tight-fitted pencil skirt and black heels, the glamour model looked . smug as she told the MailOnline that she thinks Lauren is a 'moose'. TOWIE fest: Lauren Pope and Maria Fowler were also at the London launch party and posed for photographs on the green carpet . Posing with her older sister, Billie - who wore a figure-hugging gold mini-dress from LavishAlice.com - the TV star couldn't care less that she had hurt Lauren's feelings. However, Lauren doesn't believe the relationship between her ex and the fashion store owner will last. 'If Mark didn’t treat me right, why would he treat anyone else right? I think it’ll fizzle out,' she said. 'I . think she fancies him because she’s never been able to have Mark and . he’s a bit of a player and a bad boy. But she’s more in love with the . attention of it than with him because they don’t really know each . other.' But one TOWIE couple who surprisingly staying together is Mario Falcone and Lucy Mecklenburgh. 'Crazy': TOWIE star let slip that Mario Falcone is already back with his girlfriend Lucy Mecklenburgh . When . asked if there was any chance of a romance between him and Lauren, . Mario was quick to dismiss it simply saying: 'She's not my type.' However, the pair were friendly with . one another at the event but it was James 'Arg' Argent who revealed . that Mario is already back with 20-year-old Lucy following their break-up in Sunday's episode. 'I know I shouldn't be saying anything,' he told MailOnline. 'He must be crazy.' But Mario was alone as he posed on the green carpet in a pair of blue denim jeans, a grey top and a beige coat. Dull but smiling: Katie Melua (L) and Imogen Thomas both wore black as they posed for the cameras . He shared the limelight with the . likes of Calum Best, George Lineker and Coronation Street actor, Chris . Fountain - who all turned up in casual attire. But not one to let the females down, former Big Brother star Imogen Thomas glammed up for evening. Wearing all black and bright red lipstick, the brunette model looked happy to be having her picture taken. Someone else who was smiling for the cameras was singer Katie Melua. Wearing . an odd layered dress with chunky boots and a cape jacket, she seemed . rather unaware of the TOWIE-infused drama that was taking place nearby.

Thousands of Chinese citizens are risking the wrath of their government - by sending mountains of money to a dissident artist who was handed a bill of $2.4 million for unpaid tax. More than 20,000 people, convinced that the fee is nothing more than the 'government harassment' of known dissenter Ai Weiwei, have tossed $800,000 into his garden. They have also wrapped notes around fruit to throw into his yard, folded up the cash as paper aeroplanes, and wired the money. Mr . Weiwei, who was detained for three months earlier this year as part of . an overall crackdown on dissent, said: 'This shows that a group of . people who want to express their views are using their money to cast . their votes. Scroll down for video... Support: More than 20,000 people, convinced that the fee is nothing more than the 'government harassment' of known dissenter Ai Weiwei (pictured),have tossed $800,000 of his $2.4 million 'unpaid tax bill' into his garden . Chipping in: Volunteers collect money (left) and log remittance receipts (right) sent to the home of Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei . 'It shows that in the Internet age, society will have its own judgement and its own values. People are using these methods to re-examine the accusation that I evaded taxes.' Nearly 20,000 people have sent more than 5.3 million yuan ($840,000) since he announced a week ago that the Beijing tax bureau was demanding that he pay 15 million yuan ($2.4 million) in back taxes and fines. The donation campaign is rare for Chinese dissidents because of the threat of retaliation that comes with supporting high-profile government critics. And state-run newspaper Global Times criticised the outpouring and warned it could be illegal. Mr Weiwei, an internationally . acclaimed conceptual artist, believes his detention and the subsequent . claims of tax evasion have been interpreted by activists as a way to . punish him for his often-outspoken criticism of the authoritarian . government. He said he would not treat the money from supporters as donations, but as loans that he would repay. Thank you: Commemorative ceramic seeds from Ai Weiwei's Sunflower Seeds art installation are prepared in packets to send to people who contribute money to him . No cameras please: A Chinese worker pretends to obstruct a photographer taking pictures outside the home of Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei in Beijing today . Today, staff and volunteers at his Beijing Fake Cultural Development Ltd design company were sorting through hundreds of wire transfer receipts. They were also sending off packets of sunflower seeds in return, a reference to his past installation involving 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds at London's Tate Modern. Volunteer Liu Yanping said many of the donations have been accompanied by messages of support, including 'Brother, let me be your creditor' and 'the whole family has been mobilised, everyone will be creditors'. Other messages were poetic, with one saying: 'Walk toward the light, the darkness will pass.' Feminist scholar Ai Xiaoming described her donation as 'a form of support as well as an appeal.'

He has demanded that police return the account books they seized from his studio when they detained him and that they allow him to meet with his former office manager and accountant.

'But these people are an extremely small number when compared with China's total population. 'Ai's political preference along with his supporters' cannot stand for the mainstream public, which is opposed to radical and confrontational political stances.' The newspaper also asked if Ai really needed to borrow money to pay off the tax bill, as he has shown his work in London, New York and Berlin and earned large sums selling his work at auctions and through galleries. Mr Weiwei responded to the question by saying: 'Yes, I am very wealthy, but this is a separate issue. 'I have said that I will repay every cent of the loans.

"By . Sara Nelson . Last updated at 2:53 PM on 8th November 2011 . 'Very worried': French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe today expressed concern over speculation of an Israeli strike on Iranian nuclear sites . France is 'very worried' about Iran's nuclear programme, but is opposing any strike against the Islamic Republic because it would cause 'irreparable damage'. Foreign Minister Alain Juppe today voiced concern about speculation that Israel is preparing a strike on Iranian nuclear sites ahead of the release of an International Atomic Energy Agency report on Tehran's nuclear activity. If the IAEA report, due out this week, indicates Iran is building atomic weapons capabilities, then France would firmly back further U.N. sanctions, he said, but would do all it can to stop military action. Four previous rounds of sanctions have been imposed on Iran over its nuclear programme. But Russia and China, two veto-wielding U.N. Security Council, members have made clear any new sanctions would be an extremely tough sell. 'We are very worried about Iran stepping out of line. It would seriously destabilise the region,' Juppe told RTL radio. 'France's position is firm: if we need to reinforce sanctions, we are ready,' he said. 'I think we have to do everything we can to avoid the irreparable damage that military action would cause.' Iran is pursuing its nuclear weapons program at the Parchin military base about 30 kilometers from Tehran, diplomatic sources in Vienna say . Parchin has hundreds of structures and a number of fortified tunnels and bunkers for carrying out explosive experiments . The IAEA report is widely expected to strengthen suspicions that Tehran is seeking to develop the capability to make atomic bombs, countering its claims that its nuclear enrichment programme is purely for civilian purposes. Russia and Iran warned the West against . military intervention on Monday, saying an attack would lead to civilian . casualties and create new threats to global security. Defence Minister Ehud Barak today appeared to play down speculation about an Israeli strike, insisting 'We don't want a war' China is also expressing concern about a possible American military strike against Iran. Western nations are likely to react by calling for further sanctions against the Islamic state, but speculation has been rising that Israel is preparing a pre-emptive strike on Iranian nuclear sites. However today, Defence Minister Ehud Barak appeared to play down speculation of a strike, saying it had not decided to embark on any military operation. 'War is not a picnic. We want a picnic. We don’t want a war,' Barak told Israel Radio. '(Israel) had not yet decided to embark on any operation,' he said, dismissing Israeli media speculation that he and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had chosen that option. Fresh details ahead of tomorrow's IAEA report suggest that Iran could even be 'nuclear ready' within months. And laying bare the disturbing extent of the country’s atomic weapons programme will increase calls in the United States for pre-emptive action against the Islamic state. The Iranian nuclear power plant in Bushehr, southern Iran - a site that may be targeted in a mooted military strike . However, Iran has threatened to retaliate by blocking the Strait of Hormuz, severing 40 per cent of the world’s oil supplies. Russia's foreign minister yesterday became the latest critic of any proposed action against Iran warning it would be 'a very serious mistake fraught with unpredictable consequences'. Sergei Lavrov added: 'The only path . for removing concerns is to create every possible condition' to resume . the talks between Iran and six world powers, which broke down last . December. China has also expressed concern about a military strike against Iran, but has also urged Tehran not to be confrontational with the IAEA. Moscow . and Beijing have signaled concern that the report will box Iran into a . corner and dim any chance of diplomacy resolving the dispute, which has . the potential to spark a wider conflict in the Middle East. Concerns: Russia's foreign minister Sergei . Lavrov, right, warned any action against Iran would be 'a very serious . mistake.' China's foreign minister Yang Jiechi, left, has also expressed . concern . 'The Russians in particular have been lobbying quite intensively,' one senior Western diplomat said. Meanwhile former U.S. Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice has weighed in to slam Iran saying the U.S. should consider . even tougher penalties against the Iranian government and 'be doing . everything we can to bring it down.' Rice told ABC's This Week that the U.S. should never take the option . of military force off the table when it comes to dealing with Iran. The current Iranian government is trying to obtain a nuclear . weapon and has repressed its own people, she said. 'The regime has . absolutely no legitimacy left,' she added. Israeli President Shimon Peres had earlier expressed a determination to launch a military strike against Iran. New UN evidence suggesting Iran was helped by several foreign scientists could provide further headache for Iran's President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad . 'The . possibility of a military attack against Iran is now closer to being . applied than the application of a diplomatic option,' he said over the weekend. 'I . estimate that intelligence services of all these countries are looking . at the ticking clock, warning leaders that there was not much time . left,' he added. Republican candidate Rick Perry, last week came out to back an Israeli air strike on Iran. The Texas Governor said he would support Israel on the matter if there is proof Tehran is moving closer to having a nuclear weapon. The news comes as a former Soviet weapons expert and scientists in Pakistan and North Korea are all believed to have aided Iran in its nuclear quest, according to the United Nations. Former Soviet weapons scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko allegedly taught Iranians how to build high-precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction, according to UN evidence. Danilenko was believed to have been contracted by Iran's Physics Research Centre, linked to the country's nuclear programme, in the mid 1990s. He allegedly gave lectures and shared research on developing and testing bombs that Iran then incorporated into their warhead design, according to Washington Post sources with access to IAEA's files. However, while Danilenko acknowledged his role he also said he believe his work was limited to assisting civilian engineering projects, the sources added. There is also no evidence that Russia knew of Danilenko's Iranian activities. Weapons experts added that Iran relied on foreign scientists for mathematical formulas and codes, some of which may have come from North Korea. The design for a neutron initiator by father of Pakistan's nuclear programme, Abdul Qadeer Khan, was also discovered in Iran, sources said. The latest intelligence provided to UN nuclear officials, due for publication on Wednesday and obtained by the Washington Post, suggests former Soviet weapons scientist Vyacheslav Danilenko allegedly taught Iranians how to build high-precision detonators that could trigger a chain reaction during the mid 1990s.' But it makes clear the Iranians want to be able to build such weapons quickly if need be. And thanks to outside help, the Iranians are now on 'the threshold' of making a nuclear warhead small enough to fit on top of a ballistic missile, says the study. One key technical breakthrough, say the IAEA’s intelligence sources, is that Iran has learnt how to design a device known as an R265 generator. It added there was also evidence to suggest other . precision technology linked to experts in Pakistan and North Korea had . helped advance Iran's nuclear capabilities. Iranian officials appear unconcerned. Iran’s foreign minister and former nuclear official, Ali Akbar Salehi, told the Mehr News Agency: 'Let . them publish and see what happens,' adding that the uproar over the . country's nuclear programme was '100 per cent political' and that the . IAEA is 'under pressure from foreign powers.' Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said on Sunday the U.S. feared Iran's growing military power because it is now able to compete with Israel and the West. 'Yes, . we have military capabilities that are different from any other country . in the region,' he said. 'Iran is increasing in capability and . advancement and therefore we are able to compete with Israel and the . West and especially the United States.' 'The U.S. fears Iran's capability. Iran will not permit (anyone from making) a move against it.' Proof: A test-fire launch of a short-range missile in Iran. The UN now has a 'compelling case' that Iran is building an arsenal of nuclear weapons . Iran is conducting its secret nuclear programme at the Parchin military base, near Tehran, according to sources close to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). Iran has allegedly carried out experiments in the final, critical stage for developing nuclear weapons, including explosions real and simulated. These have been carried out in a bus-sized container spotted on satellite photos, according to reports. U.S. intelligence agencies are thought to have believed the base is suitable for developing nuclear weapons for around eight years. The Iranians have rejected an IAEA request to visit Parchin in the past, arguing the IAEA rules allowed it to deny such visits to military bases. Now the site is under scrutiny again as a suspected location for covert nuclear activity. One . part of the IAEA's report is thought to reinforce concerns that Iran . continued its nuclear programme after 2003 - the year that U.S. intelligence agencies believed it had bowed to international pressures . to halt experiments. One . Iranian document suggests scientists had been discussing plans to start a . four-year study of neutron initiators beginning in 2007 - four years . after the 2003 deadline, according to sources. 'The programme never really stopped,' David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector who has seen the intelligence files said according to the Washington Post. 'After 2003, money was made available for research in areas that sure . look like nuclear weapons work but were hidden within civilian . institutions,' he added. Tehran denies secretly trying to develop nuclear weapons, insisting it is enriching uranium for reactors to generate electricity. But Iran has become increasingly belligerent in recent weeks and tensions are continuing to mount over its ambitions. The country's history of concealing sensitive nuclear activity and its refusal to suspend work that can potentially yield atomic bombs have already been punished by four rounds of U.N. sanctions, and separate U.S. and European punitive steps. Earlier this week, it was revealed Britain was drawing up contingency plans for any military action. Commanders . were working out how to deploy Navy submarines equipped with Tomahawk . cruise missiles in case President Barack Obama decides to launch missile . strikes against Iranian bases.","Russia and China warn America against Iran strike .

"By . Paul Sims . Last updated at 11:56 PM on 7th November 2011 . A criminal investigation has been launched into a mix-up at a mortuary where the body of a Falklands war veteran who died in police custody turned up in a mortuary more than a decade after he was believed to have been buried. Ex-paratrooper Christopher Alder, 37, choked to death while handcuffed and lying on the floor of a police station in Hull, in the early hours of April 1 1998. It now appears a Hull pensioner called Grace Kamara was buried in his place in 2000. Christopher Alder choked to death at a police station in 1998. It has been discovered that his body has laid in a mortuary for ten years when it was thought he had been buried . Christopher Alder was a former paratrooper. An inquest found that four police officers were guilty of the 'most serious neglect of duty' when he died . Mrs Kamara is understood to have died from natural causes in 1999 but her burial was delayed and finally scheduled for Friday. It appears the blunder was only discovered because her friends and family asked to see the body and Mr Alder's remains were found in its place in the mortuary. Yesterday Nicola Yates, chief executive of Hull City Council, apologised and launched an investigation. Today she said the police were being brought in. Mr Alder's sister Janet has battled for justice, but lost a recent challenge after claiming she had been racially abused during the investigation . She said: 'As chair of the multi-agency group dealing with the tragic circumstances around Grace Kamara and Christopher Alder, I have requested that the police undertake a criminal investigation into this extremely distressing case. 'As I said last night, I am appalled and distraught at what we have learned and my first priority has been to make sure the families involved are kept informed and given the necessary support. 'It is vital that the families and the public get a clear view of the facts and understand what happened. A thorough police investigation will make sure this happens. 'Now that the police are carrying out a formal investigation it would be inappropriate for me to comment further. 'I recognise that this has been very traumatic for everyone involved and I again offer my sincere sympathies to the families.' Humberside Police's chief constable Tim Hollis said the investigation will be carried out by the South Yorkshire force due to the sensitive history of the case. Mr Hollis said: 'Whilst the role of the police is to provide investigative support to the respective authorities I am, naturally, mindful of the strong association of Humberside Police with Christopher Alder's name and his sad death. 'It is, therefore, my decision to invite South Yorkshire Police to provide a team of officers to undertake any necessary investigation into the circumstances that have come to light. 'On a personal note, my thoughts are with the family of Mrs Kamara who, at this time, still do not know the whereabouts of her body and to Christopher Alder's family who have now been informed that Christopher's body was not buried, as they believed, in November 2000. 'Officers from South Yorkshire Police will conduct the investigation, on behalf of Humberside Police. 'This investigation will examine the circumstances surrounding the retention and safe keeping of the bodies of Christopher Alder and Grace Kamara and their subsequent release for interment.' Police officers appear to stand around as Mr Alder chokes in a police station in Hull . Two uniformed police officers try to save Mr Alder as a group watch on . Despite efforts to save him, a police officer tells his sergeant that Mr Alder has died . In another statement, Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust chief executive Phil Morley said: 'We realise how distressing this incident has been for the families of those concerned and our thoughts are with them. 'We also recognise that other members of the public may have concerns, however, following a full review this weekend the trust is confident that our systems for the identification and release of bodies from the mortuary are robust. 'It is extremely rare for a body to be retained for more than a few days in a mortuary. The normal process is to establish the cause of death, to formally identify the body and properly release the body to the family. This is usually done within 72 hours and the vast majority of bodies are only kept for this time period. 'All bodies upon release have to be correctly identified and signed out by both mortuary staff and those taking responsibility for the body. 'While this remains the subject of a criminal investigation we do not believe it is appropriate to comment further.' Yesterday, Mr Alder's sister Janet expressed her shock over the mix-up branding it 'disgusting'. The 49-year-old said: ‘[Police] told me that in 1999 a . woman called Grace Kamara, who was about 60, died from a heart attack. She was kept in deep freeze because her family, who all live in Nigeria, . were asking for repatriation.’ Miss Alder added: ‘The undertakers went to get the body and it was then they found it wasn’t Grace, it was a man. ‘It’s just unbelievable – the police . even said to me that they can’t say for sure that it was Grace that was . buried in Christopher’s grave. I don’t know what to believe.’ Miss Alder has been told by . officers that in 2000 the Hull mortuary where her brother’s body was . kept had been moved to an unknown, temporary location. A year later it was moved permanently to Hull Royal Infirmary. Miss Alder added: ‘I want to know what’s happened to Christopher’s body all these years. ‘It’s like they just went into the mortuary, saw a black person and said “send this one out”.’ Mr Alder, a father-of-two choked to death at the feet of four officers . on a police cell floor on April 1, 1998. He had been punched during an . argument outside a nightclub in his home city of Hull and was taken to . hospital, where he became hostile, perhaps because of his head injury. He was then discharged into the hands of Humberside Police, who arrested . him for a breach of the peace and took him to Queen’s Gardens police . station. By the time he arrived, he was . unconscious and his trousers were around his knees. He was left . handcuffed on the floor while the four officers looked on and did . nothing. They could allegedly be heard on CCTV . footage making monkey noises as he lay dying for 11 minutes. They later . claimed they thought he was ‘putting on an act’. But a damning report by the Independent Police Complaints Commission found the men responsible of ‘unwitting racism’. It concluded that PC Matthew Barr, PC Neil Blakey, PC Nigel Dawson and Sergeant John Dunn – who all refused to co-operate with the IPCC investigation – were guilty of a ‘most serious neglect of duty’. The officers were charged with manslaughter but acquitted at Teesside Crown Court in 2002 on the orders of the trial judge.",Hull City Council apologises and launches investigation .

The collapse of the euro would ultimately lead to a strengthening of Britain's economic position, a think tank predicted today. Despite resulting in a short recession and costing the economy 2 per cent GDP, the end of the European single currency would ultimately be beneficial, the study showed. The Centre for Economics and Business . Research also said that if the euro survives the current sovereign debt crisis with the help of bailouts, Britain could face a decade of austerity measures. The study will add further pressure on David Cameron who will today hold crisis talks with Cabinet eurosceptics as it emerged that Britain’s exposure to the International Monetary Fund could rise to £40billion. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith and Northern Ireland Secretary Owen Paterson will tell the Prime Minister he needs to toughen his stance on Europe, setting out a clear timetable for clawing back powers handed to Brussels. There is increasing concern that core EU nations are planning to use the debt crisis to join forces to ‘bulldoze’ over British interests, leaving the UK marooned in a permanent voting minority as they integrate further. Alarm on the Conservative benches . deepened last night as Treasury Chief Secretary Danny Alexander, a keen . Europhile, confirmed that Britain’s contributions to the IMF could rise . to £40billion and said he would have no problem with more money being . loaned to Greece. Rebel . MPs will be emboldened by a report from a group of economic experts, . which says the cost of the euro collapsing would be a contraction of at . least two per cent of GDP across the eurozone – but that keeping it . together will mean a decade of austerity.

Contraction: UK fell into recession in 2008. A report today suggests that if the eurozone was to collapse GDP would slide by two per cent in two -and-a-half-years of pain . Tory . eurosceptics say that Britain will be powerless to resist a tide of new . EU laws as the 17 countries in the single currency seek to keep the EU . project alive by coming together as a ‘caucus’, a group that will . override the views of the UK and other countries outside the euro. Pressure: David Cameron has come under fire from Tory backbenchers . The Prime Minister is under increasing pressure to use talks on allowing the eurozone countries to integrate economically to try to contain the crisis as an opportunity to demand protections for Britain. Mr Duncan Smith, who is the Cabinet’s leading eurosceptic, and Mr Paterson are expected to use a private meeting at Downing Street tonight to urge Mr Cameron to ‘stiffen his resolve’ on the EU to prevent further Tory rebellions. Mr Cameron was rocked last month by the biggest revolt over Europe ever endured by a Conservative Prime Minister when 81 of his MPs defied him by voting in favour of a referendum on Britain’s future in the EU. The Prime Minister will today use a . Commons statement to tell the eurozone to get its act together after the . failure of last week’s G20 summit to make progress on the debt crisis. Mr .

If Emma Barton pulls through, she will be given the heartbreaking news that she has lost her father and sister in the M5 disaster. Miss Barton, 19, whose mother died just a few years ago, had been travelling with boyfriend Chris Burbull and her family from a funeral when they were caught up in the carnage of Britain’s worst motorway crash for 20 years. Crash victim: Emma Barton, pictured, was left in a coma following the crash on Friday night. Her partner Chris Burbull has been keeping a bedside vigil . Clear-up: Police officers comb the debris after the crash on the northbound carriageway of the M5 near Taunton, Somerset on Friday evening . At least seven lost their lives and 51 were injured in the pile-up which involved more than 30 cars and six articulated lorries on Friday night. Police believe the crash was caused by smoke from a rugby club fireworks display, but a row broke out yesterday when the organiser attempted to blame the foggy weather and even the motorists themselves. Fighting for life: Emma Barton has been left in a coma following the collison . Police now want to interview several people connected to the rugby club to establish what safety precautions were taken. As the names of some of the victims were released, there were tales of heroism and astonishing escapes. One family told how they and their three show dogs managed to get out of their van moments before it erupted in flames. Friends said Miss Barton was ‘only just alive’ and Mr Burbull was refusing to leave her side in hospital. The family had faced another tragedy in 2005 when Theresa, the mother of the two girls, died of cancer aged 46. They had travelled down to the West Country in Emma's white Vauxhall car. Chris is likely to have been at the wheel. Emma worked for the Thames Hospicecare charity as a volunteer. Chief executive Jacqueline Clark said in a statement: 'We were all deeply shocked to learn that Emma was seriously injured in the M5 crash. 'Emma is a lovely and very popular girl with a generous and caring heart. 'She has given so much to Thames Hospicecare over the last few years, firstly giving up her own time to volunteer for the hospice and more recently joining our staff as a retail assistant in our Windsor shop. 'Her willingness to help the hospice whenever and wherever she could is a testament to her compassion and kindness. 'This is an absolute tragedy and everyone at the hospice is praying and hoping for Emma's speedy recovery. 'We hope that Emma's boyfriend, Chris Burbull, also a volunteer for the hospice, makes a full and rapid recovery from his injuries. Our heartfelt thoughts and sympathy are with Emma, Chris and their families at this critical time.' Neither Chris, nor Emma's father Mike, were in work at the time of the accident although Chris had previously worked as a van driver at the nearby Pinewood Studios. Laura Kyte, 20, said: ‘Chris is really worried about Emma. They met as teenagers and I think they’ve been together for about five years. ‘They are a lovely couple. They’d do anything for anyone and are great to have as friends. ‘We are all in total shock. It’s awful.’ Mr Burbull is believed to have been at the wheel of the car when it crashed. Last night his parents left their home in Slough, Berkshire, to be with their son at the Musgrove Park hospital in Taunton where Miss Barton is in intensive care. Horror: The crash scene on the M5 near Taunton, Somerset, after the biggest pile-up on British motorways in 20 years . After repairs had been carried out to the motorway, the Highways Agency re-opened the road today. 51 people were injured in the 34-vehicle pile-up . At the Barton family home in Windsor, neighbours told how Miss Barton and her elder sister Maggie had been heartbroken when they lost their mother several years ago. ‘They were a very close family,’ said one. ‘I  think they just had each other.’ Miss Barton’s father, Michael, was wheelchair-bound. Neighbours said he had been ‘poorly’ for some time and would not have been able to escape the wreckage of the crash. Maggie was described as ‘loving, caring and full of life’. One neighbour described Maggie as ‘the loveliest person you could ever meet’, while another said she was ‘the best babysitter I’ve ever had’. A young woman at the family home sobbed uncontrollably. ‘We are just devastated,’ she said. ‘I grew up with them and have known them all my life.’ Also killed in the crash were retired couple Pamela and Anthony Adams who were on their way home from visiting their daughter and grandchildren in Taunton.","Emma Barton, 19, fighting for life with her childhood sweetheart Chris Burbull at her bedside .

Breakthrough: Scientists in have genetically engineered rice to produce high levels of human blood albumin, a protein used to treat serious injury and disease . Scientists in China believe they have found a way of harvesting large amounts of a human blood protein used to treat burns, trauma injuries and liver disease - from grains of rice. When extracted from rice seeds, the protein is 'physically and chemically equivalent to blood-derived human serum albumin (HSA),' according to research published in the U.S. Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The findings could lead to a breakthrough in production of HSA, which typically comes from human blood donations. The demand for the blood protein is about 500 tons per year worldwide and China has faced worrying shortages in the past. The rice method was devised by scientists at Wuhan University in China and colleagues from the National Research Council of Canada and the Center for Functional Genomics at the University at Albany in New York. First, they genetically engineered rice seeds to produce high levels of HSA. Then, they worked out a way to purify the protein from the seeds, gathering about 2.75grams of the protein per 1kg (2.2lbs) of rice. When they tested the rice-made protein in rats with liver cirrhosis, a common condition for which the human equivalent is often used, they found it produced similar outcomes to treatment with HSA. Medical marvel? It is hoped the new technique will solve shortages in the production of HSA, which typically comes from blood donations . 'It looks like an interesting technological step forward,'  Dr Richard Benjamin, chief medical officer for the American National Red Cross, told FoxNews.com. 'It could potentially produce large quantities in a reasonable time. The disadvantage of what we currently use is that it is a blood product, which means it could transmit infection.' But concerns have been raised that it could actually raise possibility of the transmission of hepatitis and HIV since the protein comes from human blood. The protein is often used in the manufacture of vaccines and drugs and is given to patients with serious burn injuries, hemorrhagic shock and liver disease, the researchers said. Concerns: There are fears the large-scale planting of genetically modified rice fields need to produce large amounts of the protein could lead to food-supply contamination . In 2007, a shortage in China led to price spikes and a brief rise in the number of fraudulent albumin medicines on the market. But large-scale planting of genetically modified rice fields that could produce enough seed for mass production of the protein also raises environmental and food supply contamination concerns, since rice is a major world food staple. More research is needed to evaluate the safety of the rice-derived protein in animals and humans before it can be considered for the market.","HSA used to treat burns, shock and liver disease .

Causing a stink: Birmingham councillor Graham Green has accused binmen of believing they have a 'God-given' right to finish work before noon and 'put their feet up' Binmen believe they have a 'God-given' right to finish work before noon and 'put their feet up', a councillor has claimed. Graham Green, a Conservative councillor in Birmingham, launched the astonishing attack as union leaders revealed plans for a five-day strike among refuse teams in the city. The walkout, over planned changes to working arrangements, threatens to herald a return to the scenes of the start of this year, when bin bags festered in the streets for up to six weeks during an earlier dispute. Mr Green said: 'They need to come into the real world. I'm sure they're going to upset a large number of residents again. 'I listened to their union representative the other day and he seems to think they have a God-given right to start early in the morning, wake half the city then finish at 11.30am and put their feet up for the rest of the day. 'We all have to live in a different world where every penny is accounted for.' Mr Green also said that strike action could ultimately lead the council to seek a private contractor to deal with the city's rubbish. Binmen staged a one-day strike and imposed work-to-rule measures last December in a row over the loss of bonus money said to average out at £4,000 per worker. Union officials said the latest dispute essentially involved issues from the last industrial action which had not yet been settled. Dispute: Councillors at Birmingham Town Hall, pictured, have work to do in order to prevent a planned five-day strike among refuse teams in the city . Steve Foster, of Unite, would not be drawn on Mr Green's comments about binmen 'putting their feet up'. But he said refuse workers wanted to work with the council to avoid the strike, earmarked to start on November 28. Mr Foster said: 'This is a knock-on of issues from the past dispute. They (the council) came out with a reorganisation that could result in less pay and less posts. Ready to talk: Binmen in Birmingham have said they want to work with the council to avoid a strike which is earmarked to start on November 28 . The workforce has had to say ""enough"". 'We've said we're prepared to meet . the council any time, any where, to solve the dispute and have been . invited to a meeting on Wednesday and we hope that is to start resolving . the dispute.

Some 35,000 public sector workers staged a vocal, but peaceful protest as the conference got under way. Chants of ‘Tories out’ and ‘David Cameron on your bike’ could be heard clearly behind the security barriers protecting conference delegates. Taking to the streets: Thousands of union protesters marched through Manchester yesterday to show their anger at Tory cuts ahead of the party's conference in the city . March: Thousands walked through the city centre streets carrying banners from a wide range of unions . Fury: Demonstrators lit flares and sang song attacking the Prime Minister and his party during the peaceful protest . Organised by the Trades Union Congress, it was billed as a march and rally for ‘The Alternative – jobs, growth, justice’ in opposition to the coalition’s axing of public services and pensions. Police were on alert for extremists attempting to hijack the peaceful protest, with mounted officers, vans and policemen and women lining the march route. But no arrests were made. Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said a mass walkout over pension reforms planned for next month was effectively a ‘general strike’ against the cuts. He told the crowd: ‘We need a coalition of resistance, of trade unions, community groups, church organisations, and students and of our senior citizens, an amazing coalition of resistance to engage in every form of resistance, including co-ordinated industrial action. In Unison: Members of the union and others march in the event organised by the Trades Union Congress and billed as a rally for 'The Alternative - jobs, growth, justice' Anger: A group of teenage protesters daubed themselves in fake blood and use it to paint their placards attacking the Tories . Dressing up: A student protester wore bandages and fake blood, while this baby's father dressed her in a t-shirt depicting the Prime Minister on a wanted poster . ‘If you want to call it a general strike then so be it. The reality is civil disobedience is the oldest form of democracy and we should applaud it. We should applaud direct action and fantastic organisations like UK Uncut. ‘We should take our lead from the young people, the students who this time last year put 60,000 to 70,000 on the streets of London.’ Mark Serwotka, leader of the PCS union, told the crowd every village, town and city will see picket lines on November 30 when a mass strike has been called by several unions across the UK. He added: ‘If you never fight you lose every time. Now’s the time to fight, now.’ And Tony Lloyd, MP for Manchester Central, was cheered as he said: ‘One blue is even less welcome here than Carlos Tevez, and that’s David Cameron. David Cameron is not welcome in this city.’ Peaceful: There were no arrests during the protests as a large police presence assured there was no violence or chance for extremists to take over . Posters: A demonstrator carries a number of banners demanding David Cameron's resignation and a general strike . Around 50 people, from protest group Occupy, staged a sit-down demonstration in Albert Square, in front of Manchester Town Hall, a police spokesman said. Assistant Chief Constable Ian Hopkins, of Greater Manchester Police, said: ‘We are grateful to those protesters who co-operated fully with the police.’ The march required ‘a significant police presence in the interests of public safety and protecting the city’, he said. ‘Manchester is privileged to host the conference and the event is good for the city,’ he added.","35,000 stage peaceful demonstration ahead of party conference .

Honoured: One of the new elements which has been added to the Periodic Table has been named after Polish astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus . Schoolchildren now have a bigger task on their hands when studying science after three new elements were added to the Periodic Table. The General Assembly of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) has approved the names of the new elements - including one which will honour the astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus. The elements are numbered 110, 111 and 112 and are called darmstadtium (Ds), roentgenium (Rg) and copernicium (Cn). The General Assembly, which consists of 60 members from different countries, approved the new names at its meeting at the Institute of Physics (IOP) in London yesterday. Dr Robert Kirby-Harris, chief executive at IOP and Secretary-General of IUPAP, said: 'The naming of these elements has been agreed in consultation with physicists around the world and we’re delighted to see them now being introduced to the Periodic Table.' Although they have only just been approved to the table, the elements were discovered a long time ago. But names need to be officially given to them by scientific organisations. Generally, new elements are named after the person who discovered them. According to Universe Today, Copernicium was created on February 9, 1996, but its original name – ununbium – didn’t get changed until almost two years ago when German scientists proved its existence. IUPAP accepted the proposed name and symbol for it on February 19, 2010, the 537th anniversary of Copernicus’ birth. Changes: Three new elements have been added to the Periodic Table . The Polish astronomer, who died in 1543, was the first person to suggest that the Earth revolves around the sun. The General Assembly includes delegates from national academies and physical societies around the world. The five-day meeting, which had been running since last Monday and finished yesterday, has included presentations from leading UK physicists, and the inauguration of IUPAP’s first female president, Professor Cecilia Jarlskog from the Division of Mathematical Physics at Lund University in Sweden.",One new element is named after famous astronomer Nicolaus Copernicus .

Michelle Plevin rushed her six-month-old son Cason to the centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester, after his temperature rose to 39.5C and he refused to eat or drink. But she was reassured by medics that he was teething and recommended Calpol. Just hours later Carson turned blue, started fitting and was rushed to hospital where tests revealed that he had contracted bacterial meningitis, which left untreated can cause severe brain damage. Six month old Carson Wright displayed a sky-high temperature but his mother Michelle was reassured at an NHS walk-in centre in Oldham that he was teething . Over a five day period at Oldham Hospital the toddler was given urgent treatment, including oxygen and antibiotics, before being allowed to return home with his parents Michelle Plevin, 25 and father Craig Wright, 34. Mother of four Michelle, from Oldham, . Greater Manchester, is now angry that doctors failed to spot the serious condition. Over a five day period at Oldham Hospital Cason was given urgent treatment . She said: 'I'm still so upset because if he didn't start . fitting and turning blue I wouldn't have rang the ambulance - the walk . in centre should've spotted that something wasn't right. 'It was awful - he couldn't breathe and . he was so dehydrated and looked awful in hospital with all the tubes in . his nose and the needles in his arm.' The incident occurred after . Michelle, a part time hairdressing student, noticed Cason's symptoms and . decided to seek medical treatment. But unable to get an . appointment with her own GP she took him to the Integrated Care . Centre in Oldham, Greater Manchester where a doctor checked him over, . misdiagnosed his condition and sent him away. Michelle said: 'I didn't think it was teething . because I've got three kids and I know what teething is. Yet you assume . doctors know best and I took her word for it. 'If I would have ignored my instinct . and just listened to the drop in then he might not have been here today. 'A nurse said if I hadn't seen him having those fits, he could have . died.' Now Michelle, her . GP, and GP practice manager are set to submit a formal complaint to the . walk-in service, where a full investigation is underway. More serious form of the condition . An infection of the meninges (the protective membranes that surround the brain and spinal cord) caused by bacteria . Symptoms usually begin suddenly and rapidly get worse . Early warning signs can include pain in the muscles, joints or limbs, unusually cold hands and feet, or shivering, pale or blotchy skin and blue lips . Early symptoms can include a severe headache, fever, nausea, vomiting, feeling generally unwell . If you suspect a case of bacterial meningitis, you should phone 999 immediately . Treatment includes antibiotics, oxygen, intravenous fluids, steroids and other medication to help reduce the inflammation around the brain . David Beckett, chief executive of Go To Doc, a body which runs the medical centre, said: 'We fully understand the distress the situation must have caused Cason's family and while we await a formal complaint I would urge them to get in touch with us so we can fully understand their concerns. 'Our preliminary assessment suggested that the advice given was suitable for the symptoms Cason presented with at the time.' Mother Michelle, who suffered from septicemia . meningitis three years ago, hopes that this will help others spot the . signs of meningitis, as the rash - one of the most common signals - wasn't . present in her or Cason's case. She added: 'All we want is if someone goes to . the drop in and gets sent away and they're not happy then don't think . there's anything wrong in asking for a second opinion.'

"Future of Eddie Murphy's role as possible Oscar host now uncertain . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:15 PM on 9th November 2011 . Falling on his own sword: Brett Ratner has resigned from producing the Oscars show next year over his recent gay slur . Brett Ratner has resigned as producer of next year's Academy Awards. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences says the 42-year-old . filmmaker submitted his resignation yesterday, one day after he apologised . for using a gay slur at a screening of his latest movie. Academy President Tom Sherak says Ratner 'did the right thing for the academy and for himself'. Sherak said: 'Brett is a good person, but his comments were unacceptable.' Ratner was named Oscar producer in August along with TV veteran Don Mischer. Ratner issued an open letter explaining his resignation. It read: 'I called [the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences president] . Tom Sherak this morning and resigned as a producer of the 84th Academy . Awards telecast. 'Being asked to help put on the Oscar show was the . proudest moment of my career. 'But as painful as this may be for me, it . would be worse if my association with the show were to be a distraction . from the Academy and the high ideals it represents.' Yesterday Brett apologised for using a gay slur during a question-and-answer session at a screening for his new film Tower Heist. Ratner used a pejorative term to describe gay men in response to a question asked at a screening of his latest movie. In his apology he said sorry 'for any offense my remarks caused,' adding that the slur was 'a dumb and outdated way of expressing myself.' He said that 'as a storyteller I should have been much more thoughtful about the power of language and my choice of words.' Leading men: Stiller and Murphy play modern day Robin Hood characters in Tower Heist, out today . Initially Academy President Sherak said Ratner's remarks were 'inappropriate' - but said the academy had no plans to remove him from his Oscar-producing position. Eddie Murphy, who worked with Brett on the new film, Tower Heist, was set to host the Oscars, but his role is now uncertain. On Monday, Ratner also recorded an expletive-laden interview with shock jock Howard Stern. In the revealing interview, he discussed oral sex, masturbation and the size of his testicles. Beauty: Olivia Munn at an event in New York last night . He admitted he was stunned he had never impregnated anyone because of his virility: 'How lucky I am that I never got a girl pregnant.

He also claimed he asked Lindsay Lohan to get an STD test when they allegedly slept together when she was 19. He praised her natural acting talent and claimed 'everything f**ked up about her is because of her parents'. He said: 'I’m a hypochondriac. Before I go all the way, I send the girl to the doctor and check them for everything. My doctor has a test to tell if you’re going to catch something in the future even.' It's not the first time Ratner has shocked with his brash commentary. Ratner . recently admitted to having had a fling with Olivia Munn - who had . apparently referred to him in her book Suck It, Wonder Woman!: The . Misadventures Of A Hollywood Geek.

An elderly couple were stamped to death by their schizophrenic son after refusing to press charges for his earlier attacks, a court heard today. Terrence Dunkley, 59, repeatedly abused his elderly parents before his fatal attack at their home in  Lyng near Dereham, Norfolk. Police had been called to three violent attacks by Dunkley on his parents, Marguerite, 80, and her husband Arthur, 83, which included punching his mother in the face and pushing her down the stairs. But Mrs Dunkley later confided to friends she would never press charges as she loved her son. In the weeks before her death she told her neighbour: 'Terrence is my son. You will understand when you have a baby.' The court heard Dunkley, 59, went 'completely lost his temper' killing his parents by punching them to the floor and repeatedly stamping on them after they returned from church. Neighbours heard him screaming 'You f***ing bastards' and 'It's . time to go.' The former sports and geography teacher then piled up furniture over his parents' bodies after his fatal attack on June 12 2005. Prosecutor Ian James told Norwich Crown Court: 'As the police . approached the premises, the defendant came out with a demeanour . described as totally calm. 'He told police that there had been some . damage to the house and his parents were inside and they were dead.' Loving parents: Arthur and Marguerite Dunkley told neighbours they could never report him to police as they 'loved him' Police found the bodies were cold when they discovered them under the . furniture indicating they had been dead for some time. Mr James said Dunkley 'simply smiled' when the bodies were found and was arrested on suspicion of murder. Mr James said it was a 'poignant' feature of the case that Mr and Mrs Dunkley had earlier refused to press . charges against their son who had been diagnosed as schizophrenic in . 2003. Dunkley of Tottenhill near Downham . Market, Norfolk was ordered to be detained indefinitely in 2006 after it . was ruled that he was too ill to enter a plea on murder charges . Justice: Dunkley was told killing his parents were 'very grave offences' by Judge Peter Jacobs at Norwich Crown Court . But a court heard today that . his condition had improved enough for him to make a plea even though he . was still diagnosed as paranoid schizophrenic. Dunkley admitted two charges of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility and denied two counts of murder. Judge Peter Jacobs made an order . for him to be detained indefinitely in a secure unit under Section 37 of . the Mental Health Act, saying it was clear he was suffering from a . psychotic illness. The court heard Dunkley had been a geography and sports teacher in Surrey, but his mental health deteriorated after he moved to Norfolk with his wife who was a primary schoolteacher. Judge Jacobs described the killings as 'very grave offences' and said it was obvious that he had been in a 'terribly violent temper' He said: 'Family members were expressing real concern about your behaviour, but your mother and father said you were their son and they loved you and they were reluctant to do anything about it.' The judge added: 'The tragedy of this case is that you destroyed your own life as well as theirs. A further tragedy is that because of your mental state, it is something you can never fully appreciate.'",Mother Marguerite Dunkley told a neighbour in the weeks before her death: 'Terrence is my son.

"By . Sadie Whitelocks . Last updated at 4:37 PM on 4th November 2011 . Just months after breaking his neck, one gymnast has sprung back into action with his sights set on the 2012 Olympics. Despite suffering an injury last year that could have left him paralysed for life, 21-year-old Geoff Rellis is due to compete at the Northern European Championships in Sweden later this month. The determined sportsman landed on his head while attempting a somersault from a vault in August 2010 and was rushed to St George's Hospital in Tooting, London. X-rays revealed he had suffered a fracture millimetres from his spinal chord, dislocating two vertebrae. Despite suffering a broken neck that could have left him paralysed for life, 21-year-old Olympic hopeful Geoff Rellis, has returned to gymnastics and is back competing . Geoff, who lives in Tolworth, Surrey, underwent a four-hour operation two weeks later, and spent the following eight weeks wearing a neck brace which left him unable to exercise, causing him to lose a stone in weight. But after a remarkable turnaround, he was back in the gym in February and has since spent over 30 hours a week training in a 24-hour gym. He said: 'The last thing I remembered was pushing from the vault, after that it was black. I had no idea what was happening and when I woke up in hospital I was told I'd broken my neck. 'It was a massive shock at first but it just made me determined and I refused to let it get me down. I was just focused on my recovery and focused on being a gymnast again.' An X-ray showing the neck fracture and dislodged vertebrae (left) and a scan after corrective surgery (right) Geoff, originally from Kildare in Ireland, was practicing at his . gymnastics club in Tolworth on August 7 last year when he performed a . move which involved a handstand in which he would push off the vault and . rotate twice in the air. His girlfriend, Janine Pavlis, 22, was travelling to the gym at the time to film his gymnastic sequence for a YouTube montage. But as he started to turn mid-air, he . accidentally opened up from the tightly curled ball he was in and . plummeted to the floor, landing on his head in the foam safety pit. Still smiling: Geoff at the hospital before surgery (left) and after the four hour operation (right) Determined: It has taken hours of rehabilitation and training in a 24 hour gym to regain strength . After experiencing shooting pains he was immediately rushed to hospital where scans revealed the serious fracture and was operated on two weeks later. During the four hour operation surgeons fused the two dislocated . vertebrae with a metal frame and bone from his hip, by moving his . throat to one side. Support: Geoff with girlfriend Janine Pavlis . For months he was left incapable of moving his head and spent time recuperating at home. He said: 'The muscles in my neck had deteriorated so much I had to lift my head with my hands when I was lying down. 'Until December I couldn't do anything apart from lie in bed at home. I was used to working out every day and instead had to sit down and watch the TV, it was so frustrating. 'But I refused to accept that I would . never be a gymnast again.' Last December Geoff started to gain strength . and confidence using two ballet bars installed at . his home and in February 2011, his surgeon signed a letter allowing him to return to gymnastics. Now after months of . rehabilitation he is back on his feet and in the gym - and taking part . in international competitions. He added: 'It hasn't been easy and I have wanted to give up a few times. I wanted to feel a purpose to my . life again and to get that confidence back. 'If I make the Olympics, it will be a miracle. I should be dead, or at least paralysed.' Geoff - who was crowned Ireland's national . gymnastics champion last year - is now hoping to win a late call-up to Ireland's Olympic squad next summer if he gets to the final of this month's competition.","Gymnast suffers fracture millimetres from spinal chord, dislocating two vertebrae .

According to U.S. website Radar Online, Yeater told a judge: . 'When I later realized I was pregnant with Justin Bieber's baby, I tried . to contact him through his representatives but no one ever called me . back.' She stated: 'On July 6, 2011, I gave birth to a baby boy. That was . exactly 36 weeks and two days after the sexual encounter with Justin . Bieber. Baby daddy? The singer performed on Dancing With The Stars last night . 'Based upon the timing as well as the fact there were no other . possible men that I had sex with that could be the father of this baby, I . believe that Justin Bieber is in fact the father of my baby.'

"By . Sean Poulter . Last updated at 5:11 PM on 9th November 2011 . VAT change: George Osborne's decision to close the tax loophole will raise around £100m a year . A sales tax loophole used by millions to buy cheap CDs, DVDs, computer games and even contact lenses from the Channel Islands is to be closed. Chancellor George Osborne has decided on a change to the VAT regime in a move that will cost shoppers at least £100million a year. Currently, low value items costing less than £15 can be imported to the UK and from locations outside the EU - such as the Channel Islands - without carrying VAT. This has allowed large firms like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury’s and Boots, to set up warehouse operations in the Channel Islands to sell cheaper - VAT-free products to UK consumers. Amazon and other fast-growing internet specialists, such as Play.com and TheHut.com, use the same ploy. The decision to close the VAT loophole suggests these firms will now add the sales tax to all their products shipped in from the Channel Islands. The change, which comes into effect in April next year, could add £2 to the price of a blockbuster DVD, such as the Lion King, taking it up to £12. A chart CD, such as Adele’s 21, could go up by £1.60 to around £9.60. The VAT loophole has been a disaster for small independent chains and others for many years amid claims it has snatched sales from the high street. A spokesman for Tesco today vowed to keep prices low despite the duty rise. 'We always seek to be competitive on price and have no immediate plans to increase prices as a result of the change,' he said. St Peter Port on the Channel Island of Guernsey. The decision to close the VAT loophole suggests firms will now add the sales tax to all their products shipped in from the Channel Islands . 'We welcome this news and have been supportive of a level playing field for some time now.' Critics such as the Forum for Private . Business (FPB) claim it led to the closure of hundreds of stores and . associated job losses. The last Labour government rejected repeated calls to change the VAT rules, insisting it was not a loophole. However, the Chancellor criticised the system when in Opposition and is now in a position to do something about it. Conservative . Treasury Minister, David Gauke, described the move, which will bring in . an extra £100million in VAT to government coffers, as a victory for . small business and taxpayers. Large firms like Tesco, Asda, Sainsbury's and Boots, to set up warehouse operations in the Channel Islands to sell cheaper - VAT-free products to UK consumers. Online retailer Amazon uses the same ploy . ‘These reforms will ensure that UK companies, especially small and medium sized enterprises, can compete on a level playing field with those larger companies with the resources to set up operations in the Channel Islands,’ he said. ‘We are also protecting a significant amount of tax revenue. By making these changes, we are striking the best possible balance between the costs of collecting small amounts of VAT and protecting the interests of UK taxpayers and businesses.’ Senior policy adviser at the FPB, Phil McCabe, said: ‘This is a victory for small, hard-pressed shops and internet traders on the mainland who have suffered for decades because of this anti-competitive tax loophole. ‘For too long large retailers have been able to undercut them by 20 per cent on the price of a wide range of goods imported VAT free via the Channel Islands and sold online.

The credibility of a ‘KGB defector’ was in the spotlight last night after he was caught using a clumsily forged driving licence. Ikrom Yakubov, 30, claimed asylum when he arrived in the UK in 2008, and later appeared on the BBC’s Newsnight as the first agent to defect from the Uzbekistan KGB. But he now faces deportation, after a jury at Kingston Crown Court in London dismissed his elaborate story of obtaining a Portuguese licence legitimately during a top-secret mission. Police checks with MI5 and MI6 failed to back up his claims. Yakubov, who is unemployed, told the BBC’s Newsnight that  his grandfather founded the Uzbekistan KGB. He said he was in danger after criticising Islam Karimov, the country’s president, and that he had been tortured. In the August 2009 interview, he claimed agents had broken his fingers, and he had been left with intestinal injuries after being badly beaten.

Looking for something new to punctuate . its weekly broadcast, '60 Minutes' aired its first Rooney commentary on . July 2, 1987. He complained about people who keep track of how many . people die in car accidents on holiday weekends. In fact, he said, the . Fourth of July is 'one of the safest weekends of the year to be going . someplace.' Signing off: Veteran broadcaster Andy Rooney delivers his final essay for CBS's 60 Minutes at the age of 92 . More than three decades later, he was . railing about how unpleasant air travel had become. 'Let's make a . statement to the airlines just to get their attention,' he said. 'We'll . pick a week next year and we'll all agree not to go anywhere for seven . days.' In early 2009, as he was about to turn . 90, Rooney looked ahead to President Barack Obama's upcoming . inauguration with a look at past inaugurations. He told viewers that .

"Last updated at 2:15 PM on 9th November 2011 . A rogue U.S. soldier planned to detonate bombs at Fort Hood and then shoot the survivors, authorities said yesterday. Private First Class Naser Jason Abdo has been indicted on six counts for plotting to blow up a restaurant full of troops near the Texas Army post this summer. The 21-year-old will be tried on one count of trying to use a weapon of mass destruction, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. Treachery: AWOL soldier Naser Jason Abdo planned to blow up a restaurant full of his comrades in Texas . The charges have been ramped up from those brought against him in August, in an effort to increase his prison sentence. The federal grand jury has also charged him with attempted murder of officers or . employees of the United States, two counts of possession of a firearm . for use in a federal crime of violence, and two counts of possession of a . destructive device for use in a federal crime of violence. He will now be tried first on this six-count indictment, . according to the prosecution. Terrifying plot: Abdo was arrested with bomb-making materials after asking to be discharged from the Army as a conscientious objector . Abdo faced three federal charges in August - possession of an unregistered destructive device, possession of a firearm and possession of ammunition by a fugitive from justice - but the maximum penalty for each was only ten years. He was approved for discharge from the Army as a conscientious objector at the start of this year, after citing his Muslim beliefs, but that status was put on hold when he was charged with possessing child pornography. The soldier then went absent without leave from Fort Campbell, Kentucky, in early July, and was arrested later that month at a motel near Fort Hood. Police were alerted by a local gun shop owner that Abdo had been acting 'suspicious'. Investigators say they found a handgun, an article titled 'Make a bomb in the kitchen of your Mom' and the ingredients for an explosive device - including gunpowder, shrapnel and pressure cookers - in his room. An article by that name appears in an al-Qaeda magazine. Abdo told police after his arrest that he planned to make two bombs and detonate them in a restaurant where Fort Hood soldiers eat, according to documents filed in the case. At his first court appearance in July, Abdo shouted out the name of a military psychiatrist accused of a 2009 shooting rampage at the base. Cold-blooded killing: Abdo appeared to have been devising a copycat shooting following one at the base in 2009 . He yelled at the media as he left the Waco courtroom: 'Abeer Qassim al-Janabi Iraq 2006; Nidal Hasan, Fort Hood, 2009!' Hasan is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32 in the attack. Abeer Qassim al-Janabi was a 14-year-old girl who was raped and murdered by U.S. soldiers in 2006. Past crime: Nidal Hasan, the military psychiatrist accused of murdering 13 in the 2009 shooting . ABC also reported that Abdo had mentioned the name of Anwar al-Awlaki, a powerful al-Qaeda leader, during interrogations. The network said Abdo had told police he was targeting the base to 'get even,' possibly after his discharge from the army was delayed until after the child porn trial. He was arrested after a call from Greg Ebert, an employee at a Killeen gun shop, who told Reuters he was concerned when Abdo bought ammunition and smokeless powder. It was the same gun shop from which Hasan had bought his weapons two years ago. Last September, Abdo said of his conscientious objector status: 'As a Muslim, we stand against injustice, we stand against discrimination, and I feel it's my duty as an individual to do this. 'I knew that if I went to Afghanistan and, God forbid, something were to happen, that my faith was so weak that I wouldn't be admitted into heaven.' Abdo, who remains in federal custody, had not yet entered a plea for the original three charges. Authorities have said there is a gag order in the Texas case.","Prosecution brings fresh charges in effort to get life sentence .

"By . Martin Robinson . Last updated at 1:57 AM on 24th August 2011 . Four wealthy Russians cheered a gang rape like 'professional footballers celebrating the scoring of a goal' a judge said yesterday as he jailed them for a total of 36 years. Oleg Ivanov and Gregory Andreev Melnikov, both 23, Norayr Davtyan, 22, and Armen Simonyan, 19, filmed the sickening attack on an 18-year-old Malaysian fellow student at their £30,000 a year . boarding school using an iPhone. Jurors unanimously convicted the 'minigarchs' of rape after viewing the video, during which one of them labelled the victim a 'machine for ****ing', while another had to ask her name. Guilty: Clockwise from top left, Oleg Ivanov, 23, Norayr Davtyan, 22, . Armen Simonyan, 19, and 23-year-old Gregory Melnikov were sentenced to a . total of 36 years at Woolwich Crown Court . Ringleader Davtyan, who maintained that . the 18-year-old Malaysian teen was a 'slut' in the witness box, was . jailed for 10 years, Melnikov for nine years and Ivanov and Simonyan for . eight years apiece at Woolwich Crown Court this afternoon. In the course of the 'disgusting' attack they egged each other on by saying: 'You're not going to marry her.' They later showed the iPhone footage of their victim's ordeal to friends at their exclusive college in south London . Judge Peter Murphy said: 'The iPhone footage shows what can only be described as a callous disregard for the victim as a human being and indeed as anything other than an object of their own pleasure. 'Although there was no pre-existing plan, once the sequence of events started, they were encouraging each other to do more and more and were clearly seen on the iPhone celebrating their triumph almost in the manner of professional footballers celebrating the scoring of a goal. College: Oleg Ivanov was one of the four 'minigarchs' convicted of rape . 'They also boasted that they would show the footage to anyone in Moscow. '(The victim) in my judgment certainly is heard to utter the word 'no' on a number of occasions. Whatever the case of her condition, it is clear as I think it must have been to the defendants that she was in no position to decide whether to consent or not to consent, or to resist what was going on. 'No-one who has seen that footage can leave this trial without feeling complete disgust towards it.' On the night of January 21 this year, the college put on a disco for its students, while Davtyan also held an impromptu party in his room. The group of Russians filmed the whole attack on a mobile phone . The victim went to the room between 7pm and 8pm and downed a shot of whiskey before going back to the main building. She thought her drink had been spiked and felt dizzy. CCTV cameras captured her stumbling though the main entrance before later filming her in an outdoor smoking area talking to Ivanov and Melnikov. She was later seen walking away from the smoking area with Melnikov when she was taken to the party in Davtyan's room. Once there she was seen to vomit and lie down on the floor, and as the party wound down she was eventually left alone with the four men. Video footage recovered from Davtyan's iPhone taken between 12.38am and 3.10am then showed all four men raping the girl. 'At one point Mr Ivanov said he felt pity for her, but this was only after he and the others had sex with her,' prosecutor Peter Clement said. 'He was talked out of that attitude by Mr Davtyan who described [the girl] as just a whore and a machine for f******'.' The footage also showed that the rapists took regular breaks to go outside for cigarettes. Ivanov, Melnikov, Davtyan, Simonyan, all of  Deptford, South-East London, all denied two counts of rape. In their evidence, they tried to claim that the sex had been consensual. The jury of seven men and four women unanimously convicted Davtyan of two counts of rape. They convicted Melnikov of one count of rape but found him not guilty of the other, instead finding him guilty of an alternative charge of attempted rape. Ivanov and Simonyan were both convicted of one rape count and acquitted of the second.","Oleg Ivanov, Gregory Melnikov, Norayr Davtyan and Armen Simonyan were unanimously convicted of rape .

"By . David Gardner . Last updated at 8:08 AM on 9th November 2011 . Michael Jackson's jailed doctor has finally broken his silence to reveal the King of Pop's final words. Conrad Murray refused to give evidence at his trial to explain how Jackson died. But the 58-year-old cardiologist . talked publicly about the 50-year-old superstar's last moments in a . paid-for interview for a TV documentary. Conrad Murray (left) began shooting a documentary about Michael Jackson almost immediately after he died . 'He was pleading and begging to . please please let him have some milk because that was the only thing . that would work,' said Murray. The disgraced doctor was referring to propofol, the powerful hospital anaesthetic Jackson overdosed on the day he died. On Monday, a jury in Los Angeles convicted Murray of involuntary manslaughter for administering the lethal injection. Guilty: Dr Conrad Murray was convicted of involuntary manslaughter in LA yesterday . Handcuffed: Murray was led out of the courtroom by bailiffs. His sentencing is scheduled for November 29 . In the documentary, to be screened on . Channel Four later this week, Murray said Jackson looked like the . heavily made-up character he portrayed in his famous 'Thriller' video in . the days before he died. 'He really could not sleep. Have you ever seen the Thriller image when he was made up? He looked that hysterical,' he said. The physician's two-and-a-half hour . interview with detectives was the only explanation the jury and . Jackson's family have had from Murray, who was the only person with the . star when he died on June 25, 2009. Relief: Sister La Toya Jackson (left) and mother Katherine (right) Michael Jackson's father Joe (left) and brother Jermaine Jackson leave the courthouse after the announcement . But after a scene showing him . praying, Murray reveals for the first time on camera what happened in . Jackson's bedroom and blames the star's bodyguard for the chaos. He was lambasted by a string of . witnesses for delaying more than 20 minutes before calling for help . after finding the star's lifeless body. When asked if he wanted to testify, . he declined fearing his story would be ripped apart by prosecutors. He . barely said more than a few words in the courtroom . But recounting what happened in the . TV interview, Murray said: 'I told security to get the kids away from . there, get the kids away because I did not want them to see their father . getting CPR. 'And he (the security guard) says, . 'Doctor, doctor, what happened?' I need help! I'm doing CPR, Mr . Jackson's not breathing! Call 911! I need you to call 911! 'They listen to me doing CPR. Chest . compressions, I'm trying to resuscitate this patient. I'm controlling . him (the security guard) on the 911 call. The jury was sensationally shown this image of Jackson's dead body by the prosecution early on in Murray's trial . A bottle of Propofol found at Michael Jackson's home is shown in this frame grab from prosecution evidence video during Murray's trial . 'How old is this patient? 50!' Shouting, Murray added: 'Get the **** over here. Get here! I need you. Come on! Help me.' An excerpt from the documentary, . 'Michael Jackson and the Doctor: A Fatal Friendship' was shown on . breakfast TV in the US yesterday and it will be screened in full on . Friday night. Murray describes his close . relationship with Jackson, saying they both grew up having difficult . relationships with their fathers. 'He (Jackson) said of all my life I . have found one friend, which is you, Dr Conrad. I think in many ways . there are some mirror images of our lives, especially in not having the . full appreciation from our fathers,' said the doctor. 'He had a dad who never hugged him, . never hugged his own children. He lived a life greater than 100 years of . pain, only human on Earth.' He said he helped Jackson get rid of painful calluses on his feet and got him manicures and pedicures. Murray was also interviewed sitting . in a car outside the rented mansion where Jackson died. He told how he . would help sneak his famous patient out by hiding him in the back of his . car.

Michael Jackson fans react to the guilty verdict and cry out in celebration . The body of pop king Michael Jackson photographed as medics lifted it from a helicopter and into a waiting coroner's van in 2009 . 'He liked those risks,' he added. Jackson's older sister Rebbe said . yesterday that children Prince, 14, Paris, 13 and nine-year-old Blanket . were at school when the guilty verdict was announced on Monday. 'They now 'feel a lot of relief,' she added. King of Pop: Jackson dressed with a glittering body on stage in Munich's Olympic stadium . Murray, who will return to court on . November 29 for sentencing, was said to be on suicide watch in his cell . where he is being held without bail. He is being held in solitary . confinement in the medical wing of Los Angeles County Jail because of . fears he could be targeted by other inmates. It emerged yesterday that Murray is likely to walk free in months even if he is sent to jail for the maximum four years. It is even possible he could be . allowed to remain at home on house arrest with an electronic tracker . ankle bracelet, according to law enforcement sources in Los Angeles. With the city's jail system bursting . at the seams, judges have little control over the amount of any prison . term inmates have to complete. Under new guidelines targeting jail . overcrowding, non-violent criminals must be sent to local lock-ups . rather than tough state prisons. Legal analysts said the three-year . prison sentence being predicted as the most likely punishment for Murray . might amount to less than six months behind bars. 'He could also serve a sentence on . house arrest or other possible alternatives to incarceration,' said . Julia Mezhinsky Jayne, vice chair of the Criminal Law Section of the . California Bar. The jury of seven men and five women . returned their unanimous verdict after almost two days of deliberations . at the end of the six-week trial. But Murray's court ordeal isn't over. He now faces a civil lawsuit filed by Jackson's father, Joe, claiming . unspecified damages for his negligence in causing the performer's death.","Conrad Murray began shooting documentary immediately after Michael Jackson died .

Two offshore racers have been killed after their powerful speedboat flipped up into the air before crashing at high speed at a world championship event. Spectators and organisers watched as Big Thunder Marine - a 46ft Skater catamaran with four 1,200 horsepower engines - was almost torn open by the force of the collision. The powerboat came down so hard in the third lap of the seven-lap race that its right front hull was severely damaged. The accident led to the deaths of throttleman Robert M. Morgan, of Sunrise Beach, Missouri, and driver Jeffrey Tillman, of Kaiser, Missouri. Tragic: Big Thunder Marine, a 46ft Skater catamaran, goes airborne during a violent accident at the Key West World Championship event. Robert M. Morgan and Jeffrey Tillman both died following the crash . Bob Morgan was one of two racers who died in the crash at Key West Harbour in Florida . The race was halted following another accident because rescue services were severely stretched at the event. The tragedy marred the opening day of three days of racing at the Key West World Championship event. Superboat International President John Carbonell said he witnessed the crash, which occurred yesterday next to a spectator area inside Key West Harbour in Florida. 'He was probably going about 130mph and the boat's propellers were barely in the water,' Mr Carbonell said. 'The boat apparently caught some air and went bow (front) up; straight into the air, came down and went backwards.' Mr Carbonell said rescue divers were deployed to the accident site in less than a minute. Both men were removed alive from the wreckage of the catamaran and transported to Lower Keys Medical Center, he added. Mr Tillman died either before or just after arrival at the hospital.

Television actress Holly Matthews, who has appeared in television dramas Casualty, Waterloo Road and Byker Grove, was stunned when her baby daughter Brooke was diagnosed with the deadly disease just eight weeks ago. It was like history repeating itself as Miss Matthews had already beaten the disease herself at the age of seven. Survivors: Actress Holly Matthews was stunned when her baby daughter Brooke was diagnosed with meningitis just eight weeks ago - especially after she herself had already beaten the disease herself at the age of seven . She could only watch hopelessly as her tiny daughter fought for life, just as she had done years earlier. But against all the odds, Brooke has survived and has now returned home with Miss Matthews. Miss Matthews, who lives with her partner Ross Blair, 26, who runs his own online security company, said: ‘We are both survivors. I can’t believe that we have both survived meningitis like this. ‘When she was diagnosed it was like history was repeating itself all over again. I could only pray that she would pull through like I did. ‘It was terrible watching her fight for life and not being able to do anything to help her. I just had to hope that she would be as strong as I was.’ Miss Matthews was just seven years old when she started feeling unwell. She complained to her mother Clare, 51, that her head hurt and the light hurt her eyes. She was taken to the Royal Victoria Infirmary in Newcastle where doctors diagnosed her with meningitis. Miss Matthews, who lives in Coventry, said: ‘Mum was really worried about me as the doctors said that meningitis can cause brain damage, deafness and blindness. ‘Luckily they managed to catch it in time and after two weeks in hospital I had recovered enough for be allowed home. ‘Tests showed that I luckily hadn’t suffered any lasting damage and after another two months I had made a full recovery.’ Fight for life: Miss Matthews watches over Brooke as she battles back to full health in hospital . Miss Matthews was thrilled when she gave birth to her daughter Brooke in March this year, but when her daughter was just 12 weeks old she developed a high temperature. She said: ‘I was really worried about Brooke, but at first it never crossed my mind that it could be meningitis too. ‘I never thought that she would be unlucky enough to have it too. She had had her immunisation jabs several days beforehand so I thought it was just a reaction to them.’ But Brooke remained unwell so Miss Maxwell took her to Walsgrave Hospital in Coventry where doctors carried out tests. It was then that they broke the devastating news to Miss Maxwell that her daughter was suffering from meningitis too. She said: ‘I just couldn’t believe what I was hearing. I never imagined it would be anything like meningitis. ‘My mum was with me and she was really worried too. Brooke had been born five weeks premature weighing just 4Ibs, so she was only 7Ibs at 12 weeks old. It was like a newborn baby fighting for her life. ‘It brought it all back for my mum, to see Brooke fighting for her life in hospital. It was like history repeating itself.’ For 24 hours it was touch and go for the tiny baby. Doctors battled to get her temperature down but it remained dangerously high. At work: Miss Matthews (right) in a 2007 episode of Waterloo Road . Miss Matthews said: ‘At one point they told me there was nothing more they could do. All I could do was pray that she would be as strong as I had been. ‘As she lay there fighting so hard, all I could think of was that if she pulled through would she be blind, deaf or brain damaged. It was terrifying.’ Luckily the following day Brooke turned a corner in her fight for survival and her condition started to improve. Miss Matthews said: ‘When the doctors told me the news I just burst into tears. It was such an emotional moment. We were just so relieved.’ After two weeks in hospital she was finally allowed home. She has now made a complete recovery, and like her mother, has been given the clear from any lasting damage. Miss Matthews, who is currently fundraising for the charity Meningitis UK, added: ‘Luckily Brooke has been shown to be all clear from any brain damage and her sight and hearing hasn’t been affected. She is reaching all her developmental milestones, although she does have to go back to the hospital for a check up every few months. ‘I asked the doctor whether there was any connection between our meningitis cases, but he said it was complete coincidence. ‘We had both just been very unlucky. Thankfully Brooke pulled through, just like I did. And when she’s old enough to understand I’ll tell her how we both beat meningitis.’ For more information visit www.meningitisuk.org.","Holly Matthews was stunned when her 12-week-old daughter Brooke was diagnosed with meningitis .

Born into a family of respected lawyers and academics, Rupert Ross had all the advantages his privileged background could provide. But the former public schoolboy turned his back on his fortunate past to embrace the underworld and become a gangster. Today he faces life in prison after being convicted with an accomplice of murdering a rival drug dealer in a daylight assassination at the gates of Britain’s largest prison. Convicted: Rupert Ross, left, and Leon St Aubin, right, have been found guilty of murdering Darcy Austin-Bruce . Senior detectives said Ross ‘lost sight of reality’ as he plunged into the violent depths of West London’s criminal underworld. His mother, who runs the Ad Hoc . boutique on Chelsea’s King’s Road where clients include Katie Price and . Megan Fox, has been left reeling by courtroom revelations about the . bloodthirsty killing. They included a diary in which Ross . said he ‘lived a fast life, hectic, lots of wars over drugs and money, . one or two shoot-outs’. His aunt, a prominent criminal QC who . offered a large cash surety to get him bail, had no idea of the scale of . his violent lifestyle. But his grandfather Herbert Lank, a retired Cambridge don and internationally respected art restorer, has cast him adrift. Darcy Austin-Bruce was shot five times outside Wandsworth prison in south London . Ross, 30, shouted ‘I love you Mum, be . strong’ to Diana Lank, 55, as he was led to the cells after being . convicted of murder at the Old Bailey. She was duped into storing a . bullet-proof vest at her £700,000 Fulham home that proved to be a vital . part of the case against her son. Forensic tests revealed it was covered . in gunshot residue with the same chemical composition of the bullets . used to kill 20-year-old Darcy Austin-Bruce. Police never recovered the stolen scooter, murder weapon or distinctive smart suits used by the killer and his accomplice. Ross dressed like a lawyer when he approached his victim outside Wandsworth Prison in south-west London in May 2009. He pulled out a handgun and fired five times at close range. Ross, who was also wearing a crash . helmet, then ran to a waiting moped ridden by 34-year-old fireman and . convicted drug dealer Leon De St Aubin. The two men sped away as Austin-Bruce, a former Fulham FC academy player, bled to death in the arms of prison medics. The Old Bailey heard the men had once been friends but had fallen out and the shooting was the culmination of a drugs feud. The assassins took revenge days after . Mr Austin-Bruce and another man fired a gun at a car in which they were . travelling. The opportunity for murder was set up by a prisoner who used . an illicit mobile phone to tip off Ross that Mr Austin-Bruce was due to . visit a man on his wing. Fatal shooting: Police at the scene of the shooting on May 1 2009 outside Wandswoth prison . A picture taken following the shooting. Leon De St Aubin and Rupert Ross dressed up as lawyers to gun down their former friend Darcy Austin-Bruce . Detectives later found notes that . Ross, a former pupil at £30,000-a-year Dulwich College, wrote as part of . his treatment during a stay at a luxury drug rehabilitation centre, . paid for by his family. He wrote: ‘I still want the gangster . life and end up dealing again. My dealing was making good money and I . was living a fast life. Life was very hectic. Lots of wars over drugs . and money one or two shoot-outs.’ Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said: . ‘Here is Rupert Ross, out of his own pen, admitting being involved in . drug dealing – and not small scale cannabis supply but drugs of . sufficient importance to engender “lots of wars”.’ Gunman Ross was a one time pupil at the prestigious Dulwich College in south east London, pictured. He was found guilty of murder . Mr Aylett said the killing of Austin-Bruce was a ‘murder of quite breathtaking audacity’. Fellow pupils at Dulwich College, from . which Ross was expelled, remembered him as a ‘wannabe gangster’ who . adopted a strong London accent and hung out with minor criminals. In a shocking symbol of the culture of . violence surrounding the men, a second victim was shot dead on the eve . of Mr Austin-Bruce’s funeral. No one has ever been charged with the . murder of Anthony Otton, 28, a close friend of Ross and De St Aubin. Acting Detective Chief Inspector Brian Lucas, of the Met’s Trident gun . crime unit, said: ‘These men were living violent and criminal lives to . the extent that they believed they could get away with killing a man in . broad daylight as revenge for a petty argument. ‘They had lost sight of reality and . now face the consequences of their sad and violent choices. They can no . longer delude themselves of their “gangster” status.’ De St Aubin and Ross, both of Fulham, face life imprisonment when they are sentenced by Judge Martin Stephens QC today.","Detectives said Rupert Ross had 'lost sight of reality'

A woman who couldn't remove her false nails and another who had paint stuck in her hair are just some of the 'inappropriate' patients turning up in A&E, according to research. A new campaign is urging people not to go to A&E unless their condition is a genuine emergency, after figures suggested as many as a . quarter of people who go to A&E could care for themselves or use . alternative treatment. Other bizarre examples include someone seeking treatment for a sick dog, and a man requesting an ambulance after being bitten on his finger by a guinea pig. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bizarre: The NHS has released a video with actors portraying some of the stranger cases that turn up in A&E, such as a false nails disaster . One woman wanted someone to cut her toenails because she could not get a chiropody appointment. Meanwhile, one mother took her child to A&E because they had stepped in dog poo and she wanted staff to clean it off while another woman called 999 because she had diarrhoea. A further woman rushed to the department saying her hand had turned blue - it turned out to be dye from her jeans. A man also dialled 999 because he was suffering from constipation, while another went to A&E because he had a hangover. Across England, unnecessary A&E attendances are estimated to cost at least £80 million to £100 million a year. Every attendance at A&E in the UK costs a minimum of £59. The Choose Well campaign features short films of these scenarios played by actors and are available on YouTube or through social media websites. Dr Mike Cheshire, medical director at NHS North West, which is co-ordinating the national campaign, said: 'The tales told in the videos are very funny and they are extreme cases, but there are very serious issues behind them.' Dr Cheshire said unnecessary attendances 'put an enormous and unnecessary strain on the NHS, and not just in financial terms.' He added: 'Every minute that an A&E doctor or nurse spends treating very minor problems reduces the time they can spend attending to those who have suffered heart attacks, strokes and life-threatening injuries'. Commenting on the campaign, Joe Mulligan, Head of First Aid Education for the British Red Cross told Mail Online: 'When people know first aid, this not . only saves lives and reduces suffering, but can also save the NHS money through . reduced demand for services. 'Our experts have developed a free online first aid course to help deal with common scenarios.

"Vows people who swear at police will be arrested . By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 3:18 PM on 4th October 2011 . Boris Johnson tried to dodge photographers this morning as he went for a run in what appeared to be last night's shirt. Asked by photographers how he had initially managed to avoid their long lenses when he left the Midland Hotel in Manchester, the London Mayor declared: 'I'm like a whippet.' Mr Johnson, who addressed the Tory party conference this morning, left for his 15-minute run around the secure zone just after 6.30am wearing a white shirt, khaki knee-length shorts and trainers. It begs the question whether the mayor is trying to keep pace with his rival David Cameron who is regularly photographed running before work. Phew, made it. Boris Johnson returns to his hotel after this morning's run . This weekend the PM was spotted stretching his legs along the banks of a Manchester canal at sunrise. Mr Johnson's run appeared to pay off as he launched into a barnstorming speech shortly after 10am, speaking of the 'need to put the village back in the city'. He spoke of how his administration . had planted 50,000 trees and had identified thousands more growing . spaces in wasteland around the capital. He . also spoke of building affordable, decent-sized homes for families with . rooms 'big enough for humans rather than hobbits, as none of us are . getting any smaller', and expanding his cycle hire scheme. Speaking of the scheme - dubbed Boris Bikes where cyclists can hire bikes from docking stations around the centre of London - Mr Johnson said: 'There's nothing more . villagey than the sight of someone sailing elegantly past, bolt upright . on one of these big, blue, burly bicycles.' However, he conceded he he did not know whether to be 'pleased or offended' that not one was stolen during the London riots, saying that only bookshops were safer than his bike stands. Mr Johnson also contrasted the £140million bike scheme with the problems its French equivalent has encountered. He said just three bikes were stolen . during the first two months in London where as in Paris . hundreds were taken. Mr Johnson said he believes this proves there is a growing sense of 'civility and trust' in the capital' and 'respect for property that is public'. What's on the horizon? Mr Johnson spoke today of the 'need to put the village back in the city' during his speech . Hobbits? Mr Johnson spoke of building affordable, decent-sized homes for families with rooms 'big enough for humans rather than hobbits, as none of us are getting any smaller' Thumbs up: Mr Johnson said he believes there is a growing sense of 'civility and trust' in the capital' and 'respect for property that is public' He quipped: 'Does it tell you that the . people of London are more honest than the light-fingered Parisians? I . would point out in Paris over a comparable period they managed to lose . 500 bicycles. 'I don't want to violate the ""entente . cordial"" but it seems to me there are obvious comparisons to be drawn . between our population and the light-fingered Parisians. 'What I do think it shows is a growing sense of civility and trust in London, and respect for property that is public.' Mr Johnson said the 'village' mentality, where people know each others names, was key to fighting crime. Rival? Mr Cameron stands to applaud Boris Johnson's barnstorming speech this morning. Many believe Mr Johnson harbours hopes of succeeding Mr Cameron . On the economy, Mr Johnson said . that the capital could drive Britain's economic recovery if . investment in transport continues. He urged the Government not to scrap spending projects in the city despite the tough financial climate. Mr Johnson urged the Government not to scrap spending projects in the city despite the tough financial climate . He said: 'Thanks to the common sense of this coalition Government, the . settlement we got last year, we not only have the Tube upgrades, we have . Crossrail and Thameslink, which is going to be as fantastic as . Crossrail. 'I will not allow that investment and these vital improvements to be jeopardised for a short-term political gain.' And addressing the prime minister directly, he added: 'I say to my friends in the Treasury - not . all of whom I see here; well, Dave's here - Franklin D Roosevelt offered . a new deal. 'I give you the wheel deal: you help . us to invest in transport infrastructure and we in London will supply . the locomotive of the UK economy.' Mr Johnson said cutting crime and . improving transport would attract businesses and called for 'the right . tax and regulatory framework - I will say no more than that', believing . 'British enterprise will do the rest'. He told party members: 'I reckon we have a record to be proud of. 'We . have effectively cut the council tax by 10% over the last three years, . we have put Oyster on the overground, we have delivered a 24-hour . freedom pass for the people of London - a fact I hardly dare mention in . Manchester in case they get jealous - (and) the last bendy bus will . leave our streets by Christmas. Spotlight: Mr Johnson takes to the stage at the party conference. He told activists he wanted to make sure people who swear at police officers are arrested . 'In the new year we will see a generation of Routemaster-style bus with the open platform.' Mr Johnson, who previously criticised the Government's plans to cut police numbers, said he would not allow the number of officers in the Metropolitan Police to dip below what he deemed 'safe and reasonable'. In addition, he said he was changing guidance given to the Met to make sure people who swear at officers are arrested. Activists gave the mayor a standing ovation as he closed his speech saying he had delivered 'sensible, moderate, one-nation Conservative government in London', but there was 'so much more to do'. Boris Johnson leaves the conference hotel ahead of his speech this morning . He added: 'I have no doubt it is going to be a tough fight, but with your help we can do it again.' Mr Cameron, who was in the hall for Mr Johnson's address, earlier praised the Mayor, who many believe harbours hopes of succeeding Mr Cameron as Tory leader and Prime Minister. Mr Cameron told LBC 97.3 Radio today: 'At a time of economic difficulty, I think he brings strong, charismatic leadership, he brings people together, he cheers people up. 'I am right behind him because I think the last thing London needs is a return to Red Ken.' Mr Livingstone later blasted Mr Johnson's speech, branding him 'out of touch'. The Labour candidate said: 'Today we saw the real Boris Johnson - an out-of-touch Conservative, failing to put ordinary Londoners first on the issues that really affect them, from rising fares to police cuts. 'He gave no hope to Londoners facing another steep fare rise this January, which will mean bus fares are up 56% under a Tory mayor, and gave no hard commitment on police numbers, which are in fact due to fall by 1,800 according to his own Metropolitan Police figures. 'Under the Conservatives, Londoners are less well-off and increasingly less safe, under a moonlighting mayor who meets bankers more than the police. 'People in London are feeling the squeeze but Boris Johnson doesn't see it.'","London Mayor pledges to 'put the village back in the city'

A heartbroken daughter has revealed how her mother was moved nearly once a week in the five months leading up to her death. Heart patient Marion John, 84, was moved 17 times between three different NHS hospitals and her care home, before dying at  Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest on May 17 last year. Her daughter, former nurse Megan Busby, criticised doctors telling an inquest at Milford Haven that the 'communication was dire' and said it was responsible for her mother's rapid deterioration. According to family members Mrs John, from Narberth, Pembrokeshire was 'sharp and . independent' before the heart valve replacement surgery at Morriston Hospital in Swansea in January 2010. Despite her death certificate stating that she died of bronchial pneumonia  it was revealed at the court hearing last Friday that it was bleeding from the aorta that led to her death - a typical . complication with someone of Mrs John's  age. It was only after Mrs John's family disputed the cause of death and a post-mortem examination was ordered by the coroner that the internal bleeding was discovered. Speaking out against her local health care trust Mrs Busby said: 'The family had lost confidence in the care she was receiving.' She added that her mother's care home in Tenby, West Wales, Withybush hospital, the General Hospital in Carmarthen, and Morriston Hospital. failed to communicate effectively. An inquest heard how heart patient Marion John was moved around in the 19 weeks leading to her death at Withybush Hospital in Haverfordwest (pictured) Mrs John developed a series of infections in the wounds in her chest, suffered internal bleeding at the point where a new heart valve was inserted and fell and broke her leg while at Morriston Hospital. She was also due to be transferred from Withybush Hospital to Morriston Hospital but the ambulance had to turn around midway on discovering that there were no beds available, despite her pleading 'with the crew to go on'. Mrs Busby also told how her mother had been prescribed oxygen towards the end of her . life, but she found her 'gasping for air' and not on 'oxygen or fluids'. And when mother died, it took medics five minutes to arrive after she rang the call bell. Hywel Dda health board apologised for the care and Iain Robertson-Steele, director of clinical care, at . Withybush Hospital, said: 'The health board regrets the distress caused . by the circumstances surrounding this case and apologises to (Mrs . John's) family. 'We will review the case in the light of the inquest to ensure any relevant lessons are learned.'","84-year-old woman shuttled around three different NHS hospitals and a care home in her final weeks .

He is accused of four deadly attacks in France in 1982 and 1983 . Carlos the Jackal arrives at the Paris courthouse today under heavy police guard . Speaking to confirm his real name - Ilich Ramirez Sanchez - Carlos looked . relaxed and calm in jeans, sweatshirt, and a blue casual jacket as he smiled . and raised his arm in a clenched-fist salute. During a number . of interventions, Carlos was cheered from the public gallery as he blamed . 'Imperialists' for waging war on Muslims, and attacked the 'racist Zionists of . Israel'. Referring . to those he had killed, Carlos said he was 'sorry for the victims of the . attacks. The killed and wounded were in the wrong place at the wrong time'.

Supporters . attending the court included a number of Venezuelans who view Carlos as a . political prisoner. As their applause . intensified, judges called for order, saying that a courtroom was not a place . to hold a political demonstration. He had arrived in a dock made of bullet-proof glass and with a cage roof under . conditions of the tightest security from Paris's La Sante prison, where he is . already serving life for the 1975 murders of two French secret servicemen and . an informer.

Francoise Rudetzki, former head of the SOS attentats (SOS attacks) - an association of victims of guerrilla attacks - arrives at the Paris courthouse . Carlos, who has recently gone on a . hunger strike over his treatment in France's most notorious prison, had . been put into isolation for using a phone to speak to journalists about . the upcoming trial. After being convicted of the murders in 1997, he claimed he had been 'stitched up' by Israeli secret service, Mossad. The new charges relate to four deadly attacks in France in 1982 and 1983, which . killed 11 people and wounded another 100. Prosecutors allege he carried out the attacks in order to force the authorities . to release two of his accomplices, including Magdalena Kopp, whom he went on to . marry. Today, Carlos's legal team included his third wife, barrister Isabelle . Coutant-Peyre, 58, whom the notorious womaniser married in prison a decade ago. The trial is taking place under tight security - with a dock made of bulletproof glass and a roof cage . The scene of a car bomb explosion near Champs Elysées in Paris on April . 22, 1982, which left one dead and 63 wounded. Carlos has been accused of . four terrorist attacks in France during the 1980s . Supporting her husband before the trial, Ms Coutant-Peyre said: 'He is not a . criminal but a politician, like Nelson Mandela. He is a freedom fighter - a . revolutionary.' When it was pointed out that Carlos had admitted killing hundreds during his . career as a 'super terrorist', Ms Coutant-Peyre said: 'It's very unfortunate . for the victims, but there's always a reason in international politics.' In another interview on the eve of the trial, Carlos admitted being responsible . for up to 2,000 deaths. Jailed: Carlos raised his fist as he appeared in court in Paris on November 28, 2000 . High security: La Sante prison in Paris, where Carlos the Jackal has gone on hunger strike . He told El Nacional, a newspaper in his home country of Venezuela, that 'of the 1,500 . to 2,000, there were no more than 200 civilian casualties'. Carlos said he co-ordinated 'over 100' attacks during his terrorist career, . claiming that 'minor errors' had seen innocent people hurt. He also singled out America and Israel as his 'main imperialist enemies'. Ms Coutant-Peyre is convinced she can get Carlos out of his 'filthy dungeon' and see him returned home to Venezuela as a pardoned political prisoner. Carlos, who got his nickname from the Frederick Forsyth novel The Day Of The . Jackal, first made international headlines in 1975 when he led a commando raid . on an Opec oil cartel meeting in Vienna. The raid led to three deaths, with Carlos then flying to Algeria with the . dozens of hostages and ending up extracting a ransom of around £10million. Despite his confidence, Carlos is now a pale shadow of the swashbuckling young . 'revolutionary Marxist' who regularly used to appear in a Che Guevara beret and . sunglasses.

If convicted, he would have to serve a maximum penalty of life, with a minimum of 22 years jail. In a letter to the Ministry of Justice, Carlos's lawyer Francis Vuillemin said his hunger strike was in response to 'the deliberate violation of my client's rights by the prison administration'. Mr Vuillemin said a computer which Carlos had been able to use to prepare his defence case had been 'dismantled and thrown in pieces into a cardboard box, with no possibility of it being set up in his isolation cell'.

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson and Gavin Allen . Last updated at 8:01 AM on 10th November 2011 . Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou stepped down tonight without naming his successor as the nation lurched closer towards economic disaster. Parties from left and right seemed to have settled on veteran socialist Filippos Petsalnikos, the speaker of parliament, after ditching a plan to recruit a former top European Central Bank official. But talks have hit a last-minute snag, with political leaders leaving a top-level meeting without naming a new PM. Greek Prime Minister George Papandreou has officially stood down but there is no word yet on who will succeed him . Mr Papndreou leaves the presidential palace after quitting over the crisis . Greeks and the nation's international lenders have watched in growing horror for three days as party leaders feuded over a shrinking list of credible candidates to lead a national unity coalition after Papandreou's government imploded. The president's office said the talks, which have already lasted three days, would resume tomorrow morning. Earlier, Giorgos Karatzaferis, the head of a small right-wing party, had stormed out of the meeting, accusing the heads of the two main parties of using 'trickery' but not giving any details. Farcically, the breakdown in talks came less than hour after Mr Papandreou said in his televised resignation speech agreement had been reached. They need to form a unified secure a new 130 billion euro (£111.5 billion) debt deal from the eurozone and keep the country in the single currency. Greece will run out of money next month unless the new government comes to an agreement with the European Union and International Monetary Fund, Greece's last remaining lenders. In a television address before heading to meet the president, Papandreou wished the new prime minister well without giving any name and declared that Greece had avoided bankruptcy - even though Greeks are pulling their savings out of local banks due to the political turmoil. Speaker Filippos Petsalnikos was expected to take over as Prime Ministers but there were problems in discussions today . Savers have been pulling huge sums of money from their bank accounts in case the country reverts back to the drachma . They withdrew as much as 5 billion euros - nearly 3 percent of total deposits - after Papandreou's shock call last week for a referendum on the euro zone bailout, said one banker, who declined to be named. 'Many people withdrew their money from banks on Thursday and Friday and money couriers had a hard time supplying banks with cash to satisfy the emergency demand,' said another banking source, who also requested anonymity. Many wealthy Greeks moved their money into foreign banks last year as the crisis deepened. Now other people are demanding sometimes large amounts in euro banknotes, fearing that any bank savings might be converted into devalued new drachma if Greece is forced to revert to its national currency. 'We got to the point where customers ordered amounts of up to 600,000 to 700,000 euros in cash to take home - unbelievable,' the first banker said. Papandreou also said the new . government would win approval for Greece's 130 billion euro bailout deal . and secure the nation's membership of the euro zone despite its crisis. 'I am proud that, despite . the difficulties, we avoided bankruptcy and ensured the country stayed . on its feet,' he said. 'I want to wish the new prime minister success, I . will support the new effort with all my strength. 'Today, . despite our differences - political and social differences do exist - . we have put aside our fruitless conflict and disagreement,' Papandreou . said. Right-wing party (LAOS) leader George Karatzaferis stormed out of talks at the Greek Presidential Palace today . It was left to the party sources to give Greeks some idea of who their leader will be until early elections are held in February. They named speaker Filippos Petsalnikos, 60, who founded the PASOK party in 1974 along with Papandreou's late father Andreas, Greece's first socialist prime minister. However, they warned against taking anything for granted. 'We have agreed on Petsalnikos but things can change between now and when the prime minister sees the president,' a source close to the discussions between PASOK and the conservative opposition New Democracy told Reuters on condition of anonymity. Earlier optimistic reports proved premature as the parties bickered over who should take the poisoned chalice and lead a government that will impose yet more crippling financial austerity on an angry electorate. Some Greeks had put their faith in a plan for Lucas Papademos, a former vice-president of the European Central Bank, to head the new government as a technocrat and give it the credibility that politicians lost long ago. But that idea stalled in the small hours, apparently over politicians' refusal to let Papademos pick his own team to tackle Greece's overwhelming debt and budget problems. With Greeks and the European Union clamouring for an end to the game of political cat-and-mouse, the central bank governor earlier made a rare intervention to say a new coalition was imperative for securing the euro zone bailout. 'Political uncertainty has added to the stress facing the economy and the banking system,' Bank of Greece Governor George Provopoulos said in a statement. 'Any delay in forming a new government threatens to damage further the country's credibility.'","Papandreou officially steps down .

A storm forecast to be one of the worst on record in Alaska is lashing lashed the state's western coastline, tearing roofs off buildings and pushing water and debris into communities, authorities said. The storm, which began hitting Alaska late on Tuesday after building over the North Pacific Ocean, brought winds measured at up to 89 miles (143 km) per hour and flooded parts of some Native villages along the coastline. There were no reports of deaths or injuries as of Wednesday evening, and damage tallied so far was caused largely by wind and included reports of tin roofs flying off and power lines down, authorities said. Scroll down for video . Waves pound a seawall near a home in Nome, Alaska, yesterday . Sea surges: Kids plays in sea foam near the Nome harbor late on Tuesday evening as the Bering Sea storm starts kicking up in the coastal Alaskan village . 'This is a storm of epic proportions, . as it's being described,' said Jeff Osiensky, a meteorologist and . regional warning coordinator for the National Weather Service. 'This is . kind of ratcheted up to a level much higher than we've been accustomed . to.' 'I think this would probably be about . a Category 3-type hurricane if we were to do some sort of a similar . comparison,' he said. 'It's on the line of a pretty destructive . hurricane.' Category 3 hurricanes on the . Saffir-Simpson scale, which have sustained winds exceeding 111 miles . (178 km) per hour, can cause devastating damage to homes, buildings and . utilities. Osiensky said that by Wednesday . evening wind speeds were diminishing but water levels would remain high . and new surges of floodwaters were expected. Flooding: River Street is seen covered with ocean water in Nome, Alaska yesterday . High waters: A couple stands in front of River Street while the waves hit the seawall, in Nome, Alaska . Rushing in: Waves splash up on the shore near homes in Nome, Alaska . Most of western Alaska is at high . risk, from the Yupik Eskimo community of Bethel in the Yukon-Kuskowim . delta to the Inupiat Eskimo village of Wainwright on the North Slope, . according to the National Weather Service. But one of the hardest-hit areas so . far has been Nome, a former Gold Rush boomtown famous as the end of the . Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race, and surrounding villages. There, the storm tossed debris onto . roads, making driving dangerous, city officials reported. Waves have . launched 'fist-sized rocks' and logs up to two feet in diameter onto the . roadway, officials said. Despite boarding up windows in preparation for the storm, the Nome Trading Company on Front Street was continuing to serve customers yesterday . Nome's River Street was, perhaps aptly, under water yesterday . A trio get a closer look at the large waves cresting over the seawall just south of Nome's Front Street yesterday evening . 'These objects would cause injury to any person that was struck,' the city's emergency managers said in a written statement. Evacuations have been ordered in . low-lying parts of Nome and other sites, with residents housed in . schools and other public buildings. But large-scale evacuations out of . the region are not considered feasible because weather conditions make . flying hazardous, a state official said Tuesday. Nome, with 3,600 residents, is one of . the largest cities in western Alaska. The communities spread along the . coastline are mostly traditional Native settlements, with a few hundred . to a few thousand inhabitants, and no roads linking communities.

The U.S. Coast Guard has stationed helicopters and cutters . in the region to aid mariners involved in the crab fishery. The Alaska National Guard activated an operations center at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. Powerful storms of this magnitude are . common at this time of year in the Bering Sea and North Pacific, but . this storm is unusual because of its northward trajectory and the lack . of sea ice in near-shore areas like Norton Sound off Nome, National . Weather Service and other agency officials said. Boarding up: Pat Krier, owner of the Polar Cafe in Nome, puts finishing touches to his windows while his crew carries merchandise out of the cellar on Tuesday . Thrashing: Waves bang against the Western Alaska coastline as the storm moves inland . Dangerous: Charlie Weyauvanna plays in sea foam late on Tuesday as the storm intensifies in Nome . 'Forty years ago, a big storm like . this would come through and the sea ice would act as sort of a buffer,' said Mark Serreze, director of the Snow and Ice Data Center. 'The Bering Sea has and always will . have these strong storms. What is different now is their potential . destructiveness as you lose the sea ice cover,' he added. 'It's barely beginning to wind down . along the coast,' Stephen Kearney, a meteorologist for the Weather . Service in Fairbanks, said late Wednesday. 'The sea level will remain steady . into the early morning hours and then start to come down tomorrow . morning,' he told the Anchorage Daily News. The weather service said 'a potent . upper level disturbance' rotating around the Bering Sea storm is . expected to bring 3 to 8 inches (7 to 20 centimeters) of snowfall to the .

"By . James Slack and Anthony Bond . Last updated at 2:28 PM on 7th November 2011 . More pressure has been heaped on the UK Border Agency after a damning report found that is continuing to fail. The body charged with protecting the country's borders is already under investigation after damaging revelations last week that vital border checks for criminals and terrorists were secretly abandoned over the summer. Three senior officials - including Brodie Clark, the head of the UK border force - have been suspended. Suspended: Brodie Clarke is now facing the sack after claims that he relaxed passport checks . Theresa May will today give an emergency statement on the fiasco to MPs, which has led to the establishment of three inquiries. The new report has revealed that officials have lost track of a population of asylum seekers and migrants the size of Cambridge. The latest review of the UKBA by MPs also found that hundreds of foreign nationals who should have been deported are still in the country, and the agency is using euphemistic language designed to deflect attention away from key areas. Furious: Home Secretary Theresa May . Figures revealed the number of 'lost' asylum and immigration cases had tripled in six months from 40,500 in March to 124,000 in September. The so-called controlled archive became a 'dumping ground for cases where the UK Border Agency has lost track of the applicant', the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee said. The 'controlled archive', the MPs said, was 'a bureaucratic term which hides the true nature of a Government department's activity and is designed to deflect attention away from it'. It would more appropriately be called 'an archive of lost applicants', they said. The archive includes cases in which around 98,000 asylum seekers cannot be found and the agency has no idea whether the applicant even remains in the UK, legally or otherwise. It also includes around 26,000 migrants . following a review of cases, most of which are more than eight years . old, and involve those who have overstayed their visas or who have been . refused an extension of leave, such as students. The agency was also criticised for . failing to explain why 350 foreign national prisoners who should have . been deported were still in the country. Of . about 1,300 prisoners who were released between April 1 last year and . March 31 this year, more than a quarter (27%) were labelled 'unknown'. The . agency was even unable to disclose how many individuals were removed . from the country based on intelligence provided by members of the . public. Unless the public can see that officials . use the intelligence provided, 'It will simply lead to further public . frustration with the immigration system as a whole', the MPs said. More problems: Further pressure has been heaped on the UK Border Agency following a damning report by MPs . Meanwhile, whistleblowers have blamed the latest border checks scandal on an official obsession with cutting queuing times at the nation’s air and sea ports. Staff spoke out following the . revelations that a senior UK Border Agency official had secretly . abandoned checks on passports and even anti-terror watch lists for . non-EU citizens. Investigators are examining allegations . that Brodie Clark, the £135,000-a-year head of the UK Border Force, . approached the Home Secretary’s office for permission to weaken passport . checks during the busy summer months. Senior figures say he was . explicitly told ‘No’ in writing – but then went ‘rogue’ and implemented . the proposal anyway. Ministers had agreed to one relaxation of the rules – but he then went much further, it is understood. Investigations will also focus on . whether port operators, including BAA which runs most of the UK’s major . airports, were complicit in the decision because they wanted to avoid . queues. UKBA staff claim they were put under enormous pressure to avoid lengthy queues and delays which would infuriate passengers. Last night, Andy Friend, national chairman of the Border Agency union ISU, said: ‘Government  imposed job cuts have exacerbated the internal problems within the agency  along with a misplaced focus on reducing queue times at air and sea ports. Our members have been and continue to be, opposed to watered down measures which undermine their ability to secure our nation’s borders to the highest degree possible.’ The Mail revealed on Saturday how  immigration officers were told secretly not to bother checking biometric chips on the passports of hundreds of thousands of citizens from outside the EU. Staff were also instructed not to check their fingerprints or other details against a ‘warnings index’ containing the names of terror suspects and illegal immigrants. Mrs May is furious and officials have been instructed that, if criminal wrongdoing can be established, prosecutions should be brought. During her appearance before MPs, Mrs May will come under pressure to say whether anybody posing a threat to national security slipped into the UK during the time the checks were relaxed. Labour will also claim that ministers themselves began the process under which the rules were relaxed. Officials have confirmed that Mrs May and immigration minister Damian Green took a documented decision in July to allow border checks to be downgraded by a level, so that the biometric chips on EU passports would not be checked. When approached by the Mail, Mr Clark, who was suspended last Thursday and faces the sack, said he could not comment on any of the allegations because of the ongoing investigations. The UKBA was at the . centre of another controversy this summer when it emerged officials . missed six chances to stop a banned Palestinian activist from entering . the UK. Mrs May said an . investigation into how Sheikh Raed Salah was able to enter the UK in . June despite being banned found 'insufficiently robust processes' led to . six missed chances to intervene overseas, on departure to, and in the . UK. A new system needed to . be brought in to highlight live alerts to UK ports and to the agency's . overseas network, while the police national computer should be amended . to include details of those banned from the country, the Home Secretary . said .","Further pressure heaped on under-pressure agency .

But for Betsy and Katie Overman, 11.11.11 is an even more special day - their 11th birthday. The twins, from Madison, Wisconsin, . have already received their present from an aunt – a bag containing 11 . bags, each containing 11 little presents. Special day: Betsy and Katie Overman will celebrate their 11th birthday on Friday, the 11th November, 2011 . ‘If we go to school, we'll stay for 11 minutes,’ Betsy told the Wisconsin State Journal. ‘Or they may count down on the school clock to 11 minutes after 11,’ Katie suggested. Spoon-bending 'psychic' Uri Geller believes that thanks to its status as a 'balanced' number, '11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond' The . twins, born 17 minutes apart on Saturday, Nov. 11, 2000, have been . deemed the 'child messiah' by The Corduroy Appreciation Club, which . recognizes 11.11.11 as the date that most closely resembles the . material. But Friday's date will also hold meaning for many others. It will be: . The reason the date is so unusual is that 11.11.11 is the only double-figure palindromic date, since there is no 22nd month. And . the last time it happened, on November 11 1911, an almost supernatural . event saw temperatures drop by more than 60F in a single day. This was the Great Blue Norther, a cold . snap which hit the U.S. causing blizzards and tornadoes as well as . record falls in temperature. In Kansas City, it was as warm as 76F (24C) in the morning - but this had dropped to 11F (-12C) by the end of the day. A new film being released on Friday, . entitled simply 11-11-11, predicts that the day will see the opening of a . portal in to Hell, and says: 'On this day, innocent blood will spill.' Remembrance: November 11 is best known in the UK as Armistice Day, or Veterans Day in the U.S. The film by Darren Bousman, director . of several entries in the Saw franchise, features a man whose family . dies in a car crash at 11.11am, and who then begins to be haunted by the . number 11. It plays on . beliefs long held by some spiritualists, who say that the number has a . special significance and claim that many people have a mystical . attraction to the time 11.11. One group believes that 11.11 is the . special symbol of the 'Spirit Guardians', a group of 1,111 celestial . beings who supposedly look after mortals and manifest themselves in . mid-morning. Spoon-bending . 'psychic' Uri Geller has written that the number represents 'the need . to find balance in life', and added: 'When I see the number 1111, I pray . for sick children and world peace.' Horror: This Friday sees the release of apocalyptic film 11-11-11, which predicts the opening of a Hellmouth . He also believes that thanks to its status as a 'balanced' number, '11.11 is the pre-encoded trigger and . the key to the mysteries of the universe and beyond'. However, most of those who have chosen . this Friday as a day to get married are more attracted by the pleasing . coincidence than by any deeper significance. Gretna Green: The romantic town in the Scottish Borders will have an upswing in marriages on 11.11.11 . The small town of Gretna Green, a . traditional wedding venue near the border between Scotland and England, . will host at least 50 weddings on 11.11.11, compared to fewer than a . dozen on a typical November Friday. Wedding . mania will be even more pronounced overseas, such as in India where . thousands of couples have judged the date to be auspicious for a . successful marriage. Sarah . Bull, a Mail Online journalist who is getting married in Suffolk on . Friday, said that it 'means a lot to be able to get married on such a . historical date.' She . added: 'We chose 11.11.11 for our wedding day because it's a date which . nobody, including my rather absent-minded fiancé, will ever forget.' Like Betsy and Katie Overman, the day will also be one of celebration for a number of children who will be turning 11 on 11.11.11. Trousers: One group which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the Corduroy Appreciation Club, which has anointed 11.11.11 as 'The Day That Most Resembles Corduroy' because it is made up of straight lines . For . Hannah Rose Hawkins, of Walton in Somerset, England it will be even more special, . as she sees in her 11th birthday at her house - number 11. Most famously, the 11th of November is . Armistice Day in the UK - Veterans Day in the U.S. - when we celebrate . the end of World War I and commemorate the victims of that war and . subsequent ones. The reason we ascribe significance to 11.11.11 is apophenia - the urge to find patterns in seemingly random data. It is this that explains why we see clouds forming certain shapes, and why we often hear of people finding 'faces' in things like potato crisps. Apophenia is also important in the psychology of gamblers. It can either encourage those on a winning streak to believe that it will continue, or convince losing gamblers that their luck must inevitably change. While it can be a symptom of mental illness if taken to an extreme - as depicted in the film A Beautiful Mind - apophenia is instinctive to all humans as a way of drawing conclusions about the world. This phenomenon helps us, for example, to recognise abstract drawings as representing human figures, and to remember phone numbers which seem to follow a pattern. The end of the Great War came on November 11, 1918. Given the carnage seen in the war, we can assume that the date was not deliberately chosen, but was simply the earliest possible opportunity for a ceasefire. However, the decision to end the war at exactly 11 o'clock certainly was deliberate, at the Armistice was signed around five in the morning (Paris time), to take effect at the symbolic point a few hours later. Tragically, fierce fighting continued right up until the official ceasefire, and one American soldier was killed at 10.58. Of course, there is no real significance to the date 11.11.11 - not even at the time of 11.11.11 - but it is a classic example of apophenia, the human urge to see patterns in essentially random events. With that in mind, perhaps the group . which is taking the day in its correct spirit is the Corduroy . Appreciation Club, which has anointed 11.11.11 as 'The Day That Most . Resembles Corduroy' because it is made up of straight lines. However, . to say that the date is no more than a coincidence would have provided . little comfort to those who endured the bizarre weather on the last . 11.11.11. It remains to be . seen whether 11.11.11 will produce such surprises this time around, but . people should be sure to keep a careful eye on the weather - and on any . local Hellmouths - at 11 seconds past 11 minutes past 11 o'clock.","Date and time will hit 11.11.11 11.11.11 on Friday .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 8:00 AM on 10th November 2011 . A juror in the Michael Jackson trial has broken her silence to reveal why his private doctor was convicted of killing him. Debbie Franklin said she and her co-jurors found Dr Conrad Murray guilty for three reasons - he failed to call 911, had no medical backup equipment and left Jackson alone. The mother-of-two said the jurors were particularly struck by the evidence that the 'king of pop' was still alive when Dr Murray found him. Speaking out: Debbie Franklin, a juror in the Conrad Murray trial, said jurors found Michael Jackson guilty for three different reasons . She told Good Morning America that if he had the right equipment available the 51-year-old star might have lived. Asked if Jackson would still be alive, but for Dr Murray, she said: 'Yes. Absolutely.' She added: 'Conrad Murray did it. Conrad Murray agreed to be the one to . go into the bedroom and do this. He [Jackson] was looking for somebody . to say yes, and Conrad Murray said yes.' Despite this, Ms Franklin said the jury believed Dr Murray did not intentionally mean to kill Jackson. 'We don't think he even had a motive to do this. We think it was . something that he was doing that was careless that got out of hand.' Ms Franklin, who was juror number five in the trial, said initially the panel could not reach a verdict after the first day of deliberations. Guilty: Handcuffs are placed on Dr Conrad Murray as he is remanded into custody after the jury returned with a guilty verdict in his involuntary manslaughter trial over Michael Jackson's death . She said they were split and agreed to spend the weekend thinking about the evidence. On Monday after further deliberations Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail. Ms Franklin, a mother of two, said: 'We really did our job. Our hearts were pounding. Pop legend: Michael Jackson died on June 25, 2009. Dr Murray was found guilty of involuntary manslaughter and now faces up to four years in jail . 'On the first day it wasn’t unanimous, We talked about it and said lets think about over the weekend. It was stressful, there was yelling.' Ms Franklin, who works as legal assistant, said of Jackson: 'I believe he had issues, he had addictions. He was looking for someone to say yes, and Dr Murray said yes.' Ms Franklin said Jackson was still alive when Dr Murray returned to his room having been absent to ring his girlfriends. 'When he came back Dr Murray said he was alive. He was not breathing, he had pulse,' she told the TV show. 'At that point he was alive. If he had the medical equipment there, if the airways were blocked, he had nothing.' Ms Franklin said after nine hours of talking the panel of 12 voted with a show of hands to find Murray guilty. Each of the jurors wrote their decision on a piece of paper and they returned to the Los Angeles courtroom to deliver the verdict. Ms Franklin added that she was not surprised to see the 55-year-old doctor led away in handcuffs as he had been found guilty. 'I never gave it a second thought,' she said. 'It didn't bother me.' She also praised the role of the prosecution team during the trial. 'I thought they did an excellent job. They were ready for every witness. The questioning went from beginning to end. Nothing seemed to sidetrack them.' Dr Murray could face four years in prison when he is sentenced on November 29. Ms Franklin said : 'I'm glad I don't have to make that decision. 'I really have no feeling one way or the other what the sentence is. We did our job.'","Doctor convicted because he failed to call 911, had no medical backup and left Jackson alone .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 9:05 PM on 10th November 2011 . A New York woman cleared of murder charges in the shooting death of her retired police officer husband was sentenced to five years in prison on Thursday for gun possession, a decision her lawyer described as disheartening. In a case seen as a test of the battered-woman defense, Barbara Sheehan, 50, was acquitted of second-degree murder last month after her lawyers successfully argued that she fired a gun at her husband only after he threatened to kill her. She and her children testified during her trial about the violent household ruled by Raymond Sheehan, 49, a former New York City police sergeant. Barbara Sheehan was found not guilty of murder after she shot her ex police officer husband 11 times after, she and her children claimed, years of abuse. But she was sentenced to five years on a weapons charge . Both the prosecution and defense said the beatings and bruises came to an end on February 18, 2008, when Sheehan shot her husband 11 times in their Queens home. She was sentenced in state Supreme Court in Queens to five years in prison and two years of probation on the unlawful gun possession charge, based on her use of her husband's weapons. She had faced a possible sentence of 3-1/2 to 15 years. Her attorney Michael Dowd called her sentence 'disheartening' and said an appeal was planned. 'I think it is a horrific message, the sentence in this case of five years, a horrific message for battered women,' Dowd said outside the courthouse after sentencing. Raymond Sheehan reportedly threatened to kill his wife, so she shot him. She has sentenced to five years in prison and two years of probation on the unlawful gun possession charge . 'If you're a battered woman, move someplace else if you expect to get help because you're not going to get it here,' he said. Legal experts called the case a test of the battered-woman defense, in which a history of abuse is cited to explain a woman's mental state at the time she is accused of committing a crime. Key to the battered-woman defense is the issue of self defense. New York state law justifies the use of lethal force in response to an immediate threat to life. Under the battered-woman defense, lethal force can sometimes be justified even if the threat may not appear immediate. Court documents said the shooting happened after Sheehan refused to go on vacation with her husband. She testified she was scared because he had threatened to kill her if she didn't go. Prosecutors said Sheehan shot her husband 11 times using two guns the former police officer had at home. Her husband was in the bathroom shaving before Sheehan shot him. According to court documents, Sheehan told police the night of the incident: 'I shot him! I shot him! I think he's dead. He's in the bathroom.' The defense said he had grabbed a gun he kept in the bathroom and pointed it at her head, and she shot him in self defense.",Barbara Sheehan shot husband Raymond 11 times .
"By . Simon Tomlinson . Created 4:53 PM on 10th November 2011 . Hero: Lost Scotsman Sergeant Alexander Barrie was among eight wartime servicemen whose remains laid unidentified until a historian solved the mystery . The remains of a 'lost' Scots airman who saved a pilot from a burning plane a week before he was killed in World War Two have finally been found 68 years on. Sergeant Alexander Barrie and seven other RAF servicemen perished when their Halifax bomber was shot down over Denmark in 1943. A week before his death, Sgt Barrie, from Cupar, Fife, rescued a US pilot whose aircraft crashed and burst into flames at Grantham, Lincs. He rushed into the burning wreckage and dragged the badly-wounded pilot to safety, an act for which he was posthumously awarded the British Empire Medal. For nearly seven decades, Sgt Barrie and his seven comrades have lain in unmarked graves in a Danish cemetery as none of them were identifiable due to the impact of the crash. Now dedicated Danish historian Anders Straarup has solved the mystery and identified all eight airmen, bringing great comfort and relief to their families. They will travel to Bispebjerg, Denmark, for a ceremony to dedicate the new marked Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstones with the correct names on. Retired schoolteacher Mr Straarup discovered the truth after unearthing old photos of the aircraft wreckage and a German report describing the plane involved. Remarkably, he also traced . eye-witnesses to the crash after nearly seven decades by placing an . appeal for help in a local newspaper. The new information helped him whittle the potential aircraft down to Halifax bomber DT628. Perished: Novice serviceman Deryk Martin (left) was on his maiden flight to gain more experience when the plane, piloted by Sgt Bruce Brett, was shot down . One of the reasons why it has taken so . long to learn the truth is because there are seven graves for the eight . men that were on board. The Germans who buried their remains assumed there were seven of them because that was the usual number of a bomber crew. But . the aircraft in question was carrying novice pilot Deryk Martin on his . maiden flight so he could gain operational experience. Also, . the War Office wrongly informed the families the plane had crashed at . sea after an unidentified airman was washed ashore at Holland. Mr . Martin's younger brother Anthony, 80, from Melton Mowbray, . Leicestershire, today said it is a wonderful but emotional time for his . family. Names to remains: Sgt Roland Lyster was navigating on the doomed flight, while Sgt John Waring was the aircraft engineer. They have finally been recognised . Bomb aimer pilot officer Ronald Glover . He said: 'Our only regret is that our mother, father and elder brother didn't get to find out what happened to Deryk. 'He was reported as missing believed killed in action and then it was thought the plane had crashed in the sea. 'My . mother held out hope that Deryk had been taken prisoner and after the . war she believed he was suffering from amnesia in a corner of Europe . somewhere. 'So to hear this . news after 68 years and the prospect of being able to pay hommage and . say goodbye to him is staggeringly wonderful.' Mr Martin's nephew, Nigel Martin, 49, added: 'The gratitude my father, uncles and auntie feel towards Anders is enormous. 'At last the story has come to an end and they can honour their brother properly and say a proper goodbye.' Jean Brett, 86, from Ferndown, Dorset, is the younger sister of pilot Sergeant Bruce Brett. She said: 'I am very pleased and relieved to hear this news after so long.' Mr . Straarup, 67, said he felt compelled to identify the unmarked graves at . the Bisperbjerg cemetery out of gratitude to the war dead. He said: 'This is my way of showing my respect and gratitude to those who fought and died for our freedom. 'At that time, in the middle of the war, the Allies were our friends and because of them we ended up a free nation.' Tragedy: The wreckage of the men's Halifax bomber shot down over Denmark during World War Two. Remarkably, historian Anders Staarup even tracked down eyewitnesses to the crash as he sought to find their identities . The crew of DT628 were pilot Sgt Bruce . Brett, navigator Sgt Roland Lyster, bomb aimer Pilot Officer Ronald . Glover, wireless operator Sgt Peter Shortland, flight engineer Sgt John . Waring, mid upper gunner Sgt Clifford Vandy, rear gunner Sgt Alexander . Barrie and second pilot Sgt Deryk Martin. On . the night of April 20, 1943, Halifax DT628 of 51 Squadron, Lincs, was . part of a formation of 339 bombers on a raid on German munitions . factories in Poland. While . over the Danish coast the aircraft was struck by German flak. Realising . they were going down, the crew dumped the 1,000lbs bomb in a field . before crashing at Halskov. The impact caused the remaining incendiary bombs and fuel to blow the Halifax apart. Anonymous: The cemetery in Bisperbjerg, Denmark, where the eight men were buried in unmarked graves . Finally honoured: The Bisperbjerg ceremony is officially opened. The families of the men will now travel there to dedicate the new marked Commonwealth War Graves Commission headstones . Mr . Straarup said: 'In local archives I found some photos of the plane . wreckage and was able to identify a Rolls Royce Merlin engine which . Halifax bombers had. 'Another photo showed a feature of the undercarriage which proved it was definitely a Halifax. 'I then placed an article in a local newspaper and to my surprise several eye-witnesses who are still alive today came forward. 'They stated the bomber came in over Denmark with the main force when it was shot at and crashed at Halskov. 'I also found German reports with a list of 30 aircraft that were shot down in this operation - 19 of them were shot down on Danish territory.' The man to thank: Determined historian Anders Straarup has closed a chapter in history that was shrouded in mystery . Mr Straarup then contacted Peter Gilmore at the 51 Squadron History Society. He confirmed eight Halifax bombers crashed over Denmark and seven of them are accounted for. After checking the names on the Runneymede Memorial in Surrey for lost airmen, Mr Gilmore was able to confirm the names of the crew through a process of elimination. With the 'jigsaw' of evidence pieced together, Mr Straarup presented it to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission which agreed it had been proved beyond doubt. Neil Smith, of the 51 Squadron History Society, said: 'When Anders approached us for help we were able to prove the graves must belong to the crew of DT628 because we traced all of the other British bombers that crashed that night and every other aircraft we were able to pin to a different geographical location. 'The crew has lain in anonymous graves for the last 68 years. 'Now we have traced all of the families and most of them are planning a trip to Denmark to visit their loved one's graves next spring for a ceremony.'","Eight servicemen died after plane shot down over Denmark in 1943 .

"By . Richard Hartley-parkinson . Last updated at 6:10 PM on 4th October 2011 . David Cameron promised a 'better time ahead' as he acknowledged today that families are suffering difficult times due to the uncertain economic situation. The Prime Minister said the Government is taking action where it can to help keep families' bills down, citing Chancellor George Osborne's announcement yesterday of a one-year council tax freeze. But he insisted that he would stick to the deficit reduction package of cuts and tax rises. Scroll down for video . David Cameron left the conference hotel with MP Nicky Morgan this morning to give interviews in which he said he understood the financial difficulties faced by families . Speaking at the Conservative Party Conference in Manchester, the Prime Minister also warned that interest rates would . rise if the international money markets lost confidence that Britain . was paying off its debts. 'The whole message of this conference is that we know things are difficult, we know families face difficult times right now, but we have got to show the leadership to make the right decisions and get us through this difficult time and get to a better time ahead,' he told ITV1's Daybreak. 'I completely understand that families today do see the prices at the petrol pump high, food prices have gone up. Many people, particularly in the public sector, have had their pay frozen. 'I understand the difficulty people are going through, so the council tax freeze is helpful because that is one bill that is not going up. Finishing touches: David Cameron, William Hague and aid Kate Fall go through the Prime Minister's keynote speech, which will be delivered tomorrow . 'All the time, we are looking to see is there spare money we can use to help Britain's families get through what is a difficult time.' Mr Cameron told BBC Radio 5 Live: 'People are very worried about future job prospects, and this Government has got to do everything we can to reassure them that the difficult decisions we are taking, and I believe they are necessary, are in the long-term interest of the country.' The PM insisted it was 'completely unfair' to say the Tories were supporting the rich. 'Overall . the richest 10 per cent are going to pay 10 times more tax than the . poorest. I think this is a fair way to reduce the deficit.' Calling for responsibility at the top of society, Mr Cameron backed Mr Osborne's plan to tackle tax avoidance. The Prime Minister repeated his Chancellor's vow that the Tories would not be moved from its deficit reduction plan . 'I want responsibility from people at the top as well as at the bottom and paying your taxes is a key responsibility.' Mr . Cameron rejected the idea that the government had found more than £1billion for extra spending commitments 'down the back of the sofa'. And . he defended using the money to fund weekly bin collections and a . council tax freeze rather than cutting the deficit more quickly. Eric Pickles (pictured) came in for praise from Cameron for his plan to freeze council tax . 'When a government is spending around £700billion a year it is perfectly possible, through good financial management, to find savings and underspends and use that money wisely,' he said. 'With bin collections, I think a lot of families in this country would say ""Look, the one service I get from my district council is the bin collection and I really would like them to collect the smelly food waste once a week"". 'I think that is a thing you should expect in a civilised country. 'I think that is a good use of money by (Communities Secretary) Eric Pickles, I think the use of money to freeze council tax is a good use of money.' Mr Cameron said it was possible to take action on 'people's priorities' because the Government had been 'very tough on its own costs'. Mr Cameron said he did not believe the Government should intervene to stop bonuses or put a cap on pay in the banking sector. He told the Today programme: 'On the question of bonuses, if there is a bank entirely in the private sector, I want to see responsible behaviour and I want to see us regulating properly, but we can't determine the pay structure in every single organisation. That wouldn't be the right thing to do. 'Companies do need to attract and retain and recruit good staff. I am not opposed to the idea of bonuses. I used to work in business, I used to employ staff and negotiate bonuses with people. 'A bonus on top of what you earn to reward hard work and good behaviour is part of what happens in corporate life and that's entirely right.' Mr Cameron said Labour leader Ed Miliband had gone 'off the rails' in his conference in Liverpool last week when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones. 'Where I think Ed goes off the rails is the idea that the Chancellor of the Exchequer can sit there and say there is one tax rate for this company and another tax rate for that company. Mr Cameron said that Ed Miliband had gone 'off the rails' at the Labour Party conference when he proposed using tax and regulation to support good business practices and penalise bad ones . 'It is completely impractical and that is why the business response to the Labour conference was so negative, because they thought 'Heavens above, we are trying to grow an economy and get more people working and we need investment and jobs. What on earth is this guy talking about?'' Mr Cameron challenged Mr Miliband's claim that Labour was opposed to the culture of 'something for nothing' in British society. 'I have been saying for five years that if you put into society you should get out of society,' he said. 'If you do the right thing, bring up your children, work hard and try to take a role in your community, you should be able to look back on a life and say 'I did the right thing and it was worth it'. 'The tragedy in our country today is too many people who do the right thing think it's not worth it because actually they get punished for that good behaviour, rather than rewarded. 'What I found rather staggering about the Labour conference is that they don't seem to understand that the massive budget deficit they built up was a something-for-nothing deficit. 'The fact that they haven't tackled all these people on welfare who for years have been able to stay on welfare even though they could work - that was a something-for-nothing culture. 'The words are great, but what matters in government is are you doing the things to back them up.' Mr Cameron insisted that the Government was following its mantra that 'we are all in this together' in paying down the deficit. 'I don't accept this is a Government that has one rule at the top and one rule at the bottom,' he said. 'We are absolutely asking people at the top of our society to be responsible and we are completely dissatisfied about the way the banking industry behaved over the last decade.'","Prime Minister warns that interest rates would rise if markets lost confidence in Britain .

"By . Emily Andrews . Last updated at 10:33 PM on 9th November 2011 . The Catholic Church should no longer run a leading school where child sex abuse went unchecked for 60 years, a damning report has recommended. Its author, Lord Carlile of Berriew QC, said all faith schools should be run by independent educational trusts, maintaining a ‘faith ethos’ but with lay governors. His independent inquiry found monks at Ealing Abbey in west London assaulted pupils at St Benedict’s, one of the country’s top Catholic schools, from at least the late 1940s until 2007. Child abuse: St Benedict's School, in Ealing, west London, which is run by Benedictine monks . He detailed 21 separate abuse cases at the school. St Benedict's is under Ealing Abbey's watch, which is run by Benedictine monks. Four top fee paying schools, . including Ampleforth College, North Yorkshire, and Downside, near Bath, . share similar structures to St Benedict's. Lord Carlile strongly criticised the . cover-up of sexual abuse and sadistic bullying at the school and the . destruction of documents as the abbey repeatedly failed to intervene or . investigate. The £12,000-a-year school’s . headmaster, Christopher Cleugh, offered a ‘heartfelt apology for past . failures’ and accepted Lord Carlile’s recommendations in full, including . setting up a new governing body. Lord Carlile launched an independent inquiry into the sex abuse . In his inquiry, Lord Carlile outlined . a catalogue of failures by the west London abbey to intervene as . allegations of abuses came to light. ‘I have come to the firm conclusion . that the form of governance of St Benedict's School is wholly out dated . and demonstrably unacceptable,' Lord Carlile wrote. ‘The abbot himself has accepted that it is 'opaque to outsiders'.’ The report said the crimes of Father David Pearce, . jailed for a catalogue of abuse against five boys over a period of 36 . years, illustrate how ‘St Benedict's rule of love and forgiveness . appears to have overshadowed responsibility for children's welfare’. Pearce, referred to as the ‘devil in a dog collar’, was jailed in October 2009. The report added: ‘In a school where . there has been abuse, mostly - but not exclusively - as a result of the . activities of the monastic community, any semblance of a conflict of . interest, of lack of independent scrutiny, must be removed.’ Two trusts should be launched to . remove ‘all power from the abbey’ while maintaining the Benedictine . connection for the parents, Lord Carlile said. Changes will be in place by the beginning of the next academic year, he added. Catholic church: Ealing Abbey (pictured) neighbours St Benedict's school and is also being investigated by the Vatican . Mr Cleugh said the school was ‘totally’ committed to implementing the changes. Responding to the report, he said: ‘Past abuses at the school have left a terrible legacy on those affected and have tarnished the reputation of St Benedict's. Police are also hunting Father Laurence Soper (pictured) over allegations of child abuse . ‘On behalf of the school, I offer my heartfelt apology for past failures.’ According to campaigners, those affected by sex attacks may number in the hundreds. The report comes after the High . Court ruled that the Catholic Church can be held liable for the . wrongdoings of its priests. Martin Shipperlee, an abbot at the school, . commissioned the independent review before the Vatican announced it had . ordered a separate inquiry into historic sex offences at St Benedict's and . Ealing Abbey. Police are also hunting Father Laurence Soper, 81, over allegations of child abuse dating back to when he taught at St Benedict's from 1991 to 2000. A former abbot of Ealing Abbey, he is believed to have been living in a monastery in Rome but was due to return to London to answer bail in March. He is the subject of an international manhunt after a European arrest . warrant was issued against him. Speaking today, Lord Carlile urged Father Soper to surrender himself to officers, saying: ‘I regret very much the difficulties he has caused.’ Lord Carlile's report was commissioned by the abbey to examine how to improve child protection.","Those affected by sex attacks at St Benedict's school may number in the hundreds .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 8:36 PM on 10th November 2011 . Cancer-stricken Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez (pictured on September 17) Cancer-stricken Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez's is not expected to live more than six months, according to a former U.S. ambassador. Roger Noriega, former U.S. ambassador to the Organisation of American States, said the disease could kill him before the presidential elections in October next year. He said U.S. officials believe it is unlikely he would stand as a candidate in the close run race for control of South America's biggest oil exporter, according to the Miami Herald. Formerly the leader of the fifth Republic Movement Chávez has held the position of president since 1999. Writing in a column called 'Hugo . Chávez’s Big Lie and Washington’s Apathy' published on Inter-American . Security Watch, Noriega said information and documents from the . Venezuelan government which he had seen suggest his cancer is . spreading faster than expected. He said: 'The international team of doctors in charge of treating Hugo Chávez’s cancer does not expect him to live more than six months'. He added: 'His physical deterioration is . speeding more rapidly than his doctors had predicted and, despite this . serious situation, Chávez has insisted on receiving low doses of . chemotherapy to avoid long absences from the political scene during this . fragile period.' Noriega said doctors think the decision not to increase the dose of chemotherapy so he can continue work is very dangerous for his health. He wrote leaders within the regime were now worried about how they were going to explain the 'big lie' to the public, who have been lead to believe their president is 'healed'. Chavez (right) completed a fourth round of chemotherapy in Cuba in September. He is pictured here with Bolivia's President Evo Morales at the Miraflores Palace . In September Chavez denied rumours of a setback to his health claiming he was expecting to complete his cancer treatment. He . called state television and urged Venezuelans to 'pay no attention to . rumors' which were circulating about him having kidney failure. 'I'm fine,' Chavez said. 'I'm here in my place of work and working.' He said he was taking steroids and other medicine to recover from chemotherapy and said he was working at 'half throttle'. He underwent surgery in June to remove a tumour from his pelvic region. Critics of Chavez have accused him of giving slow, incomplete reports on his illness that have fed rumors. Following his socialist ideology, Chavez has focused on implementing socialist reforms in the country. In . the early 1980s he founded the secretive Revolutionary Bolivarian . Movement-200 (MBR-200) after becoming disillusioned with the Venezuelan . political system which he viewed as corrupt and undemocratic. He was imprisoned after leading the group in an unsuccessful coup d'état against the government in 1992. On his release two years later, he founded the Fifth Republic Movement, and was elected president of Venezuela. He . has proved a controversial and divisive figure and his influence in . Latin America led Time magazine to include him among their list of the . world's 100 most influential people in both 2005 and 2006.","Disease could kill him before presidential elections .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:05 PM on 10th November 2011 . Clothing discovered in bushes near the car of a missing mother-of-four belonged to her, a friend has claimed. Karen Johnson Swift, 44, has not been . seen for 12 days after she was reported missing by her husband on October 30. A pair of jeans and a grey zip-up top were found by the side of the road close to where Mrs Johnson Swift's car was abandoned, a quarter of a mile from her home in Dyersburg, Tennessee. Disappearance: Karen Johnson Swift was reported missing by her husband on October 30 in Dyersburg, Tennessee . A friend of the missing woman, Laura Jane, told The Huffington Post: 'They found her Halloween costume in . the car. 'Some other articles of clothing that belonged to her - a pair . of jeans and a gray zip-up - were found in some brush not far from her . car. 'They confirmed [the clothing items] belong to her. They took DNA . from her mother and compared it to DNA on the clothes.' Calls to Sheriff Jeff Boxx, who is leading the investigation in Dyer County, by MailOnline were directed to his voicemail today. Police would not confirm that the articles belonged to the missing woman until they had a full analysis from the state crime lab. Clues: Police have released images of Karen Johnson Swift's car - a white 2004 Nissan Murano - which was abandoned by the side of the road around a quarter of a mile from her Tennessee home . Sheriff Boxx previously told the Dyersburg State Gazette: 'We . are searching for anything of interest. And we are still inspecting . other potential evidence, which we have recovered.' Mrs Johnson Swift has two sons in college and two daughters aged seven and nine. One friend, who would not be named, told local TV station WMCTV: 'She would not willingly leave us. We would like answers and we want her back.' It is believed that Mrs Johnson Swift picked her daughter up from a Halloween sleepover at around 1:30am because she had not been feeling well and stayed with her daughter during the night. Mother missing: Friends of Karen Johnson Swift, fourth from left, say it's 'not in her nature' to leave her family . When the child woke at around six am, her mother was gone. The youngest girl 'just cries' and will 'hardly eat' now, a family member told ABC. On October 11, the mother-of-four had . filed for divorce from her husband David Swift but the couple remained living . under the same roof. Mr Swift has been interviewed by police but has not yet been named as a person of interest in his wife's disappearance. He told police he last saw his wife at home after she . returned from the party to drop off their children. It is believed her estranged husband has hired a lawyer and is no longer talking to the authorities. Search: Aerial shots show the rural area near the town of Dyersburg where the mother-of-four disappeared in the middle of the night almost two weeks ago . Vanished: Mrs Johnson Swift's husband David reported her missing after her car was found abandoned in a woodland area . None . of the family have spoken to the media about her disappearance but Mr . Swift wrote on Facebook: 'We want her home and love her very much.' Her vehicle, a white 2004 Nissan Murano was found with a flat tyre in a rural area. Police have released new images of the car at the scene which it is hoped will help solve her disappearance. Authorities are continuing to comb the area and have brought in helicopters to conduct aerial searches. Another friend of the missing woman, Cathy Bona, said: You hear so many different things on a day-to-day basis about what's found that you don't know what to believe until you officially hear it.' Distraught: Cathy Bona, a friend of the missing 44-year-old, said her friends didn't know what to believe about her disappearance . She added: 'I do believe they are doing . all they can do. They are searching fields, ponds, rivers, looking . everywhere they can with what information that they have.' Friends will hold another prayer vigil for the missing mother-of-four in downtown Dyersburg tonight. Missing: The mother-of-four has not been seen since Halloween . Friends of the woman have come forward, saying they suspect foul play because Mrs Swift would never voluntarily leave her family. Carrie Engelhardt, a friend of Swift's, told FoxNews.com: 'It’s not in her nature. We’re really concerned and worried because it’s been over a week now.' There are no signs of foul play and her disappearance was being treated as a missing persons case, Sheriff Boxx told KAIT. The cell phone of the missing woman, who has . blonde hair and green eyes, was also missing. Police said it was last used at about 5am on Sunday when Mrs Swift . accessed the internet on the device. Police were working with the phone . company to pinpoint its last location. On Saturday, the sheriff's department arrested a neighbour who has been accused of poisoning two dogs, one of which belonged to the Swift family, in early October. The suspect, 39-year-old John Hogshooter, was charged with animal cruelty in the case, according to the State Gazette. The paper reported that Mrs Swift had tried to speak to Hogshooter about her dog weeks before she disappeared, but he was not home. The sheriff's office has not said whether or not he is suspected of being involved in Mrs Swift's disappearance. Vanished: Karen Johnson Swift's husband David told police that he last saw her at their home in Dyersburg, Tennesee . In . addition, her home in Dyersburg is just 80 miles away from where . 21-year-old nursing student Holly Bobo was abducted in Darden in April. Six . months after that disappearance, her family are continuing their own . searches and investigators are developing leads and working on the case . daily. But authorities can not yet be certain that the two cases are connected.","Friend claimed clothes belonged to Karen Johnson Swift who was last seen by her husband on October 30 .

"By . Rob Cooper . Last updated at 1:57 AM on 10th November 2011 . Schools across the  country will shut as head teachers strike for the first time in their history, it was confirmed yesterday. Further misery for parents came after the National Association of Head Teachers voted for strike action over cuts to their pensions. However, there was anger last night after it emerged that thousands of the heads and deputy heads planning to strike will be partially insulated from the  pension reforms. Walkout: The National Association of Head Teachers voted 75.8 per cent in favour of strike action for the first time in their history. Union members can be seen here at their annual conference in Brighton in May . This is because last week’s last-minute concession from ministers offered to guarantee the final  salary schemes of all those who are within ten years of retirement. In addition, data unearthed by the Daily Mail shows at least 1,000 head teachers are so-called ‘p . This will mean they receive the equivalent of £58,000 a year throughout their retirement. Business leaders called on the Government to withdraw its concessions and ‘face down the Scargills of our schools’. Yesterday’s strike decision was the first time in the 114-year history of the NAHT that it has resorted to industrial action. Strike: Russell Hobby, the union's General Secretary, said members voting in favour of action for the first time marked an 'unhappy milestone' It represents heads and deputy heads who work in 85 per cent of state primaries and 40 per cent of state secondaries. They are also in charge of around more than a fifth of private schools, some 600 establishments. They claim the Government’s plans would leave them working longer, paying more in monthly contributions and – for those not within ten years of retirement – receiving less when they retire. Around 24,500 of 28,000 members were balloted for strike action  and around 40 per cent voted  in favour. Turnout was high in relation to recent ballots on strike action – 53.6 per cent. Of the 12,864 members who actually voted, some 75.8 per cent, 9,750, backed strikes and 3,114 voted against. They are now due to take part in the TUC’s national day of action on November 30. They will join other public  sector unions including three  representing teachers – the National Union of Teachers, the Association of Teachers and  Lecturers and the University and College Union. A fifth classroom union – the NASUWT – is expected to vote in favour of the strike next week. Russell Hobby, the NAHT general secretary, who earns £148,260 a year including contributions paid into his pension scheme, said: ‘I have spoken at length to many school leaders and not one has been anything other than upset and sometimes downright angry that they have been forced into this situation as the only way to stand up for the profession and standards.’ Some 12,400 heads, of a total of 56,800, are over the age of 55. However just 1,900, currently work later than their 60th birthday. Strike: Thousands of public sector workers marched through central London as they staged a one-day walkout on June 30. The NAHT today voted for a walkout . Official figures show the average salary for head teachers aged 60 and over across the primary and secondary sector is £62,280. Up to 1,600 earn more than £100,000. The average head teacher can expect an annual pension pay out of £36,000. It would cost £674,000 to buy  an annuity this large in the private sector. Nick Gibb, Schools Minister, said: ‘Strikes benefit no one - they damage pupils’ education; disrupt and inconvenience parents’ lives; and risk the professional reputation of teachers in the eyes of the public.’ In addition to head teachers, more than 100,000 teachers and teaching assistants are due to strike on November 30. Also, dinner ladies and cleaners and admin staff, who belong to other unions such as Unison, will be striking. The combination will result in massive staff shortages that will make it impossible for most schools to open, for practical or health and safety reasons.","Thousands of schools likely to shut on November 30 .

"By . Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor . Last updated at 6:35 PM on 9th November 2011 . The giant Comet electrical chain, which has 248 stores and 10,000 staff, has been sold for just £2. The price, which is cheaper than a pack of batteries, offers grim evidence of the dire straits suffered by many specialist high street retailers. More significantly, the Comet owner Kesa Electricals is giving the new owners a further £50million to take it off its hands, and retaining liability for the staff pension scheme, which has a £40million deficit. Sold: Comet was today sold for a token £2 after its owner Kesa Electricals called time on the loss-making business (London store in Greenwich Retail Park pictured) Mother of four Stacey Jackson who recorded a record with US rapper Snoop Dog. Mrs Jackson's husband Henry runs the investment company which bought Comet today. Mr Jackson claims expertise in turning around failing retailers . Electrical chains are among the main . casualties of the biggest cost of living squeeze in more than 60 years . as shoppers put off ‘big ticket’ purchases. Earlier this week the US electricals giant, Best Buy, announced the closure of its 11 UK outlets and abandoned plans to set up a national chain. Separately, the Dixons group, which includes Currys and PC World, has also issued profits warnings. The household name chains have been forced to cut prices to tempt shoppers through the door, while they are also being squeezed by online retailers and the supermarkets, who have moved into the market. Kesa, which has been reviewing options for Comet since June, said the UK chain was expected to make a loss of £22.3 million in the six months to October 31, after like-for-like sales fell 18.6per cent. Comet was founded in 1933 by George Hollingbery as Comet Battery Stores Limited, as a two man operation charging batteries and accumulators. It then moved into the radio rental business and by 1939 had 2,500 accounts with a small fleet of vans. In 1968 Comet opened its first out-of-town electrical retail store,in Hull. In 1970, the company went public and in 1984 it was taken over in a £129m deal by Kingfisher plc.By 1987 consumer group Verdict recognised Comet as the best retailer of electrical goods in Britain and in 1991 it opens it first service headquarters in Leeds. The launch of the Comet Price Index in November 1995 reinforced the company's commitment to low prices. Comet acquires Norweb Retail in 1996 and increased its store portfolio to over 250 stores nationwide. Leading retail specialist KPMG said, in Retail Week in 2001, that Comet's new concept 'destination stores' pose a serious threat to all competitors in the electricals industry. In 2005 the stores undergo a £20million re-branding campaign, mainly to differentiate itself from competitors such as Currys. Its policy was called Every Day Low Pricing, with the promise that they’d check competitors’ prices and reduce theirs to match. But Comet regularly faced criticism for poor customer service issues and were investigated by Trading Standards for allegedly refusing to refund faulty products. The store saw its retail profits increase steadily from the years 2000 to 2005, reaching £52million, but since 2008 has seen dramatic decreases due to competitive trading in the economic downturn. Revenues fell 22 per cent over this summer alone. The firm has already announced plans . to shut one of Comet’s three warehouses, axe 12 of its 14 regional . service centres and close nine under-performing stores as part of a . cost-cutting drive. The remaining staff will inevitably fear further closures and redundancies. Kesa . chairman, David Newlands, explained the decision to pay the new owners . to take over Comet, saying: ‘The £50million is categorized as an . investment but the truth of the matter is we had to pay £50million to . get the business away. We will be writing it off as having no value.’ Kesa has sold the business for a nominal £2 to investment company OpCapita, which is run by the millionaire former investment banker, Henry Jackson, who claims expertise in turning around failing retailers. He is married to Canadian-born singer Stacey Jackson, a mother of four who is described as a Chelsea ‘yummy mummy’ and had an unlikely UK dance chart hit earlier this year with ‘Live it Up’, featuring rapper Snoop Dog. Mr Jackson’s predecessor investment company – Merchant Equity Partners - bought MFI for just £1 in 2006 and then sold it to managers in 2008. Despite its involvement, the business subsequently went bust. Retail analyst Philip Dorgan, of Panmure Gordon, said he could understand the reason for the fire sale. ‘Clearly, the board has decided that sustaining Comet’s losses into an uncertain future is the wrong thing to do and it is difficult to disagree with them,’ he said. This week, the British Retail Consortium detailed the tough trading conditions for electrical chains in the past month. It said: ‘It was another tough month, with sales largely promotion-led and often for replacement purposes rather than upgrades. ‘Big-ticket items in particular continued to struggle as uncertainty about jobs and income prospects made people reluctant to spend unless they perceived value or really needed the item.’","Also, Comet's owner GIVES buyers investment company OpCapita £50m to take it off its hands .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:26 AM on 11th November 2011 . A senior News of the World journalist arrested over the phone hacking scandal claimed yesterday he had made secret recordings of his bosses. Neville Thurlbeck, ex-chief reporter for the Sunday tabloid who is currently on police bail, claims to have compiled a large dossier of taped conversations and memos, which is now with his lawyers and proves phone hacking was ingrained in the culture of the paper. Mr Thurlbeck also cast doubt on James Murdoch's insistence to the culture select committee that he was never told the full extent of illegal voicemail interceptions at the News of the World. Phone-hacking suspect Neville Thurlbeck, the former News of the World chief reporter, claims he was offered immunity in return for evidence that could potentially implicate ex-news editor Ian Edmondson, right . He claims the News International . executive chairman was shown the crucial 'for Neville' email, which . first made clear that journalists other than royal editor Clive Goodman, . jailed in 2007, were engaged in criminal activity. Yesterday MP Tom Watson told the . Commons Culture, Media and Sport committee that he had met with Mr . Thurlbeck, and that he – like Mr Murdoch – insists that he was never . shown the 'for Neville' e-mail, even though it bears his name and was . apparently meant to be forwarded to him. It emerged during a legal action taken . against the paper by Professional Footballers' Association chief Gordon . Taylor. Mr Thurlbeck claims he pleaded with NI's former legal manager . Tom Crone not to show it to Mr Murdoch because he feared he would lose . his job as a result. More questions: News International Executive Chairman James Murdoch gives evidence to the Commons Culture Committee inquiry into phone hacking today . Detectives have been deluged with 300million emails handed over by News International. The extraordinary amount of evidence was revealed as an outside police force recommended more officers be drafted in. Initially the Operation Weeting team began with 45 detectives, there are now 118 working on the hacking inquiry and two associated investigations, at a cost of £3million in salaries alone. Scotland Yard has arrested 17 people so far over the scandal. But he says he could not persuade him, . and a week later Mr Crone allegedly confirmed to Mr Thurlbeck that he . had shown it to his boss. This would appear to contradict Mr . Murdoch's testimony that he was never shown the e-mail. The evidence . seized from Mr Thurlbeck's home by police is thought to include a . recording of a conversation between him and Ross Hall, the junior NoW . journalist who sent the e-mail. In the tape Hall is alleged to blame a . senior NoW executive for commissioning the hacking of Mr Taylor. Mr Thurlbeck, 50, has lodged a claim . for unfair dismissal against News International. Among the large batch . of recordings and memos which are with his lawyers, one tape is said to . be of a NoW executive agreeing that Mr Thurlbeck had nothing to do with . the hacking of Mr Taylor. It is understood that Thurlbeck tried . to offer the tape to very senior NoW executives in April this year in a . bid to prove his innocence. However, . they were said to have been 'very angry' that the paper's chief . reporter was conducting his own inquiries, refused to collect the . recording and told him to keep quiet. The . revelation that Mr Taylor had been targeted dispelled News . International's claims that phone-hacking was limited to rogue Royal . reporter Clive Goodman, who was jailed over the affair. Mr . Thurlbeck denied commissioning the voice-mail interception and it is . believed that a recording and a memo that were found at his home may go . some way to clear his name. The . memo to the paper's former editor, Colin Myler, and the former head of . legal, Tom Crone, is said to name other senior executives. It is claimed that the message was sent in July 2009 before Parliament was told that hacking was restricted to a rogue reporter. After his arrest Mr Thurlbeck claims . to have been offered potential immunity from prosecution if he would . testify against former colleagues. He refused because he thinks he will . be exonerated. Pressure: The paper's former editor Colin Myler, left, and News International head of legal affairs Tom Crone, right, give evidence to MPs . Close: News Corporation chairman Rupert Murdoch, left, and former News International chief executive Rebekah Brooks, right, who have also been questioned over the scandal . Police allegedly made the approach after previous suggestions that Thurlbeck had passed information on crime to the police. Court reports revealed Mr Thurlbeck was charged with corruption over his relationship with a National Criminal Intelligence Service detective. But the men were acquitted in July 2000 and Mr Thurlbeck later said that the information he provided to police was applauded by the judge. Police have refused to discuss the role of informants. The apparent move suggests that police are still gathering evidence in the investigation which could run for many more months. Mr Thurlbeck, who has always insisted that he is innocent, said that he declined the offer. He told the Independent that he believed he would eventually be cleared. He said: 'I have informed Scotland Yard that while I fully understand and respect the reason for their request of me to give evidence for the Crown in any prosecution arising from Operation Weeting, it is my opinion that a detailed and forensic inquiry into my working methods by what is a highly professional police unit will fully exonerate me. So... I have declined their offer.' The latest evidence is believed to have emerged after officers from the Met raided Mr Thurlbeck's home earlier this year.","Police 'found memo and secret recordings' at Neville Thurlbeck's home .

"By . Hugo Duncan . Last updated at 10:25 AM on 31st August 2011 . Britain’s debt levels are dangerously high and are damaging the economy, according to one of the world’s leading financial watchdogs. Debt in the UK grew faster than in any other major economy in the last decade to £180,000 per household. It means the country is in the danger zone following a ten-year borrowing binge under the last Labour government, a hard-hitting report from the Bank for International Settlements has revealed. Dangerously high debt: The British economy has flat-lined for the last nine months . Its chief economist, Steve Cecchetti, said: ‘Beyond a certain level, debt is bad for growth. At low levels, debt is good. It is a source of economic growth and stability. But at high levels, private and public debt is bad, increasing volatility and retarding growth.’ The BIS said government, corporate and household debt in Britain jumped from 223 per cent of gross domestic product in 2000, or £2.18trillion, to 322 per cent, or £4.68trillion, in 2010. That is the equivalent of £180,000 per household. The 99 percentage point increase was the biggest of any leading economy and left Britain deeper in the red than any country in the Group of Seven industrialised nations except Japan. The watchdog warned that debt levels in Britain ‘will explode’ unless it gets to grips with future spending on health and pensions as the population gets older. ‘The debt problems facing advanced economies are even worse than we thought,’ said Mr Cecchetti, who is based at the BIS headquarters in Basel, Switzerland. ‘As public debt rises and populations age, growth will fall. As growth falls, debt rises even more, reinforcing the downward impact on an already low growth rate. Hard-hitting: The report came from the Bank of International Settlements in Switzerland . ‘The only possible conclusion is that . those with high debt must act quickly and decisively to address their . looming fiscal positions. 'The longer they wait, the bigger the negative . impact will be on growth, and the harder it will be adjust.’ The Treasury welcomed the report – called The Real Effects of Debt – which was presented to central bankers and economists at the Jackson Hole summit in Wyoming last week. ‘This underlines the need for us to get a grip on our debt levels,’ said a spokesman. ‘Part of the reason the recovery is a challenging one is because all parts of the economy are having to adjust – and the numbers will continue to get bigger unless we get them under control.’ The watchdog said the danger limit for government debt is 80 to 100 per cent of a country’s GDP. The threshold for corporate debt is 90 per cent of GDP and for household debt it is 85 per cent, it said. Once these levels are reached, debt starts to hold back growth, the report found. In 2010, Britain had government debt of nearly 90 per cent of GDP, corporate debt of 126 per cent and household debt of 106 per cent. Of the G7 economies, only Britain and Canada were in the danger zone for all three types of debt. The British economy has flat-lined for the last nine months, growing by just 0.2 per cent in the second quarter of the year following six months of stagnation. The subdued recovery at home has been weakened further by a slowdown overseas, particularly in the U.S. and the eurozone, Britain’s two biggest trade partners.","Debt in Britain grew faster than any other major economy .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Last updated at 9:13 AM on 11th November 2011 . Colette's body was flown back to her hometown of Bridgend where she was cremated. But Colette's family were convinced her death was suspicious - and asked British police to investigate . A husband has been arrested on suspicion of murdering his wife on their honeymoon seven years ago. John Davies’s bride Colette, 39, was found dead at the bottom of a ravine just a week into the holiday in India. She had plunged more than 80ft from a viewing point, but Indian police ruled out foul play and a British coroner said that the death was an accident. However, Mrs Davies’s family were convinced she died in suspicious circumstances and persuaded their own local police to investigate. And after flying to India to visit the scene and interview witnesses, officers  yesterday arrested Mr Davies, 50. The couple had married more than a year before going on a delayed honeymoon in 2004, trekking in the beautiful Himachal Pradesh region of India. Mrs Davies’s body was flown back home to Bridgend, South Wales, where she was  cremated after an inquest recorded an  accidental verdict. South Wales Police would not say when exactly they began their own inquiries but confirmed that a team of officers flew to the town of Solan in northern India to review the investigation carried out by the force there. They visited the spot near the town of Gaura where Mrs Davies was found dead and re-interviewed more than a dozen witnesses. Yesterday they arrested Mr Davies at his £300,000 home in Milton Keynes and took him back to Bridgend for questioning. The couple had lived in a semi-detached house on a quiet estate in the town after they were married in October 2002. Colette and her husband John delayed their honeymoon to go trekking near the Giri River (pictured) in the beautiful Himichal Pradesh region . A former neighbour said yesterday: ‘It was a real mystery to us what happened. They went off together on honeymoon but only he came back. ‘We heard there had been a terrible accident and Colette had died. We never really heard much more, and then within a few months he was gone. It is a real shock all these years later.

But detectives from South Wales travelled to India as part of a review of the case. ‘While I consider this arrest to be a positive development in the investigation, I am also appealing for any information surrounding the circumstances of this death. ‘Colette’s family have been informed of the arrest and continue to be supported by specialist family liaison officers.’","Colette Davies, 39, found at bottom of ravine after falling 80ft from viewing point while out trekking ."

A criminal out on bail beat an elderly woman to death, stole her engagement and wedding rings and then used them to propose to his girlfriend, prosecutors said yesterday. Raymond Harris, 36, showed off Virginia . Perillo's rings at a party just hours after an . attack last month that left the OAP unconscious and bleeding in her Chicago garage. Former nurse Perillo, 73, was rushed to a hospital but declared brain dead. She died two days later. Charged: Raymond Harris (left) is accused of beating Virginia Perillo (right) to death and then using her engagement ring to propose to his girlfriend . According to the Cook County State's Attorney's Office, Harris asked friends at the party which of the two rings he should present when he asked his girlfriend to marry him. They said he wound up giving her both when he proposed a week later. Police arrested Harris, who was paroled in May after serving 13 years of a 30-year sentence for attempted murder and aggravated arson, as a suspect in the killing after they found a bloody watch in her car. Tests showed a match with Harris' DNA, which was already held in a law enforcement database. His fiance subsequently turned the rings over to police. Harris, from Carpentersville, Illinois, was charged yesterday with murder and armed robbery in Perillo's death. He is being held without bail. In 1997, just weeks after he was released from jail on an armed robbery conviction, Harris invaded the home of a woman, beating and raping her repeatedly over several hours, prosecutors said. Harris then slit the victim's throat, knocked her unconscious and set her house on fire. The woman woke up with her legs in flames and suffered third-degree burns but survived.","Raymond Harris is charged with murder and armed robbery of woman, 73 .

"By . Chris Greenwood . Last updated at 11:45 AM on 9th November 2011 . Princes William and Harry were among more than 150 public figures kept under surveillance by a private detective working for the News of the World, it emerged last night. The princes were secretly followed and filmed under the noses of their armed protection officers on the instructions of the now defunct Sunday newspaper. Scores of high-profile celebrities, politicians and sportsmen were spied on over an eight-year period by Derek Webb, a former policeman who claims to have received MI5 training during his career with the Hertfordshire Constabulary. Watched: Princes Harry and William were reportedly kept under surveillance by a private detective who was working for the News of the World . Harry’s former girlfriend Chelsy Davy, actress Angelina Jolie and football pundit Gary Lineker were also targeted, as was Maxine Carr, former partner of Soham killer Ian Huntley. Mr Webb, who is believed to have earned hundreds of thousands of pounds working for the News of the World, was still following people on its behalf until its closure in the summer. Labour MP Tom Watson, who has been a thorn in the side of News International by continually raising phone hacking in the Commons, was watched when he attended a conference in Brighton last year. Victim: Prince Harry's former girlfriend Chelsey Davy was allegedly targeted by the spies . Solicitor Mark Lewis and his former assistant Charlotte Harris, who represent many of the most prominent phone-hacking victims, were also trailed. Mr Webb revealed the industrial scale of the spying operation when he told BBC’s Newsnight that he was paid to follow targets selected by the newspaper from 2003 until it was shut down in July. He said other targets were Manchester United boss Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham and former Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho. Several former Cabinet members, including John Prescott and Charles Clarke, were also followed. Although carrying out surveillance is not illegal, the revelations mean the News of the World continued to snoop on people even after its royal editor Clive Goodman was jailed for phone hacking in 2007. Goodman admitted working with private investigator Glenn Mulcaire to intercept messages, including those left on the phones of senior royal aides. News International’s chairman, James Murdoch, will inevitably face difficult questions about the surveillance when he appears before MPs tomorrow. Members of the Culture, Media and . Sport Committee, which is probing the phone-hacking scandal, want to . know who sanctioned the surveillance operations. A lawyer working for the News of the . World instructed a private detective to put two solicitors under . surveillance in a bid to get them into professional difficulties. Julian Pike, a partner at the Queen’s . solicitors, Farrer and Co, told News International executives that . trailing rival lawyers Mark Lewis and Charlotte Harris could reveal they . were ‘an item’. In a separate email to private . detective Derek Webb, he added that if they could be shown to be living . together, it could help bring professional misconduct proceedings . against them. In another letter to Mr Webb, Mr Pike wrote: ‘I write to . confirm my instruction.’ Mr Lewis and Miss Harris are the . outspoken representatives of some of the most high-profile victims of . phone hacking by the News of the World, including  the family of Milly . Dowler. The suspicions proved to be without . foundation but Mr Lewis’s former wife was secretly watched and filmed in . and around her Manchester home. The messages provide fresh evidence of . desperate manoeuvring behind the scenes at the Sunday newspaper as the . phone-hacking scandal unfolded. News International admitted the newspaper had ordered the surveillance and branded it ‘deeply inappropriate’. There are suspicions that the scale of . the covert investigations was one factor in the eventual resignation of . News International chief executive Rebekah Wade. Mr Webb passed a dossier of evidence about his surveillance activities to Newsnight after falling out with the newspaper over a payment when it closed. The former detective constable founded a private investigation agency, named Silent Shadow, after retiring in 2003. He was soon hired by the Sunday  newspaper to follow and document the activities of scores of celebrities over the next eight years. He specialised in secretly filming his subjects and kept meticulous notes about their movements. His most high-profile target was Prince William, who he followed during a visit to his father’s Gloucestershire home Highgrove over several days in 2006. It is not known when Harry was followed, but the antics of the party-loving prince were a regular feature in the tabloid newspaper. The surveillance operations raise uncomfortable questions for Scotland Yard protection officers charged with safeguarding the princes’ security and privacy. Other targets are said to have included Lord Goldsmith, who was followed while he was attorney general, London mayor Boris Johnson, Chelsea footballer Frank Lampard, former Director of Public Prosecutions Ken Macdonald, Paul McCartney and Lord Coe. Mr Webb also trailed the parents of Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe between 2009 and 2011. Mr Webb said nine out of ten of those . put under surveillance were celebrities or politicians. ‘I would write . down what they were wearing at the time, what car  they were in, who . they met, the location they met, the times,’ he said. Spied: The parents of Harry Potter actor Daniel Radcliffe, left, and . former attorney general Lord Goldsmith, right, were also allegedly spied on . Details of the massive surveillance operation emerged after Mr Lewis disclosed that Scotland Yard detectives had handed him documents revealing how he was targeted early last year. The solicitor’s clients include the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, whose voicemails were hacked after she went missing in 2002. His former wife was secretly filmed at . her Manchester home, and while visiting shops with her daughter. Mr . Lewis plans to sue News International for breach of privacy. Labour culture spokesman Harriet . Harman said: ‘These revelations take the shame of the phone hacking . scandal to a new low.’ A spokesman for Prince William declined to . comment. Targeted: Charlotte Harris and Mark Lewis, . who represented victims of phone hacking, were allegedly tailed by a . private investigator . News International has admitted it was ‘deeply inappropriate’ to put Mr Lewis and Miss Harris under surveillance and said the move was ‘not condoned by any current executives’. A spokesman added last night: ‘We are not able to make any comment around the specific work carried out by Derek Webb. As is well known, the News of the World was closed by News International during the summer.’ Mr Webb told Newsnight last night: ‘I used my 15 years of experience to evade the attention of royal protection officers. They didn’t rumble me, they had no idea.’ Jules Stenson, former head of features at News of the World, branded Mr Webb a ‘man with a grudge’. ‘All we are getting is one side of this from Derek Webb,’ he told Newsnight. ‘He’s clearly a man with a grudge who’s got a grievance against the company for not getting any compensation (when the paper closed). You are getting a very slanted story and you are not hearing any context to these investigations.’ A dossier compiled by private investigator Derek Webb reveals the names of 153 people allegedly targeted for surveillance by the News of the World between 2003 and 2011. Here are the celebrities, politicians and other public figures said to have been singled out. The list, obtained by Channel 4 News, does not include ordinary members of the public.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:21 PM on 10th November 2011 . The Duchess of Cornwall doesn't want to become Queen because of the sensitivity connected with the memory of Princess Diana. Camilla has instead made it clear she intends to be known as Princess Consort should Prince Charles outlive his mother and become King. This is despite the fact that legally she will become Queen should Charles take the throne. Should Charles become King, Camilla would be legally entitled to call herself Queen. However, aware of the sensitivity around the memory of Princess Diana she has made clear she wishes to be known as Princess Consort . In the same way, senior royal sources . say Prince Charles's wife is technically the Princess of Wales, but . chooses not to go by that title again because of the sensitivities associated . with Diana. A senior royal aide yesterday insisted the position is not set to change, telling the Daily Express: 'Legally, she will be Queen, but that doesn't mean she has to go by that title. 'In the same way, she is legally the Princess of Wales but she doesn't use that title because of the sensitivities.' It is widely believed that Prince Charles does not want his wife to be remembered as being deprived of the title. When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, the Royal Household said it was convention that the wife of a King was known as his Queen. Despite her insistence, earlier this . year Camilla did nothing to quash rumours she still wanted to be Queen . when an eight-year-old girl asked her: 'Are you going to be Queen one . day,' and she replied: 'You never know.' A senior royal adviser told the Express: . 'It will be up to the Government of the day to decide whether it thinks . legislation is needed.' The Duchess has recently impressed many with her willingness to publicise good causes and engage with the public. But it hasn't always been the case. Hitting the dance floor: Charles and Camilla gamely showed their moves during the 'chapauringe' dance during a visit to the Old Fort in Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar. The couple are visiting Tanzania on an eight-day Commonwealth tour . A dancer placed a yellow, red and black khanga on Camilla's shoulders but she soon had to remove in the heat . Camilla was extremely unpopular after she and Charles became . lovers in the 1980's while he was still married to Diana, the nation's . sweetheart. When asked to cite the cause of the . marriage breakdown on BBC's Panorama, Diana responded 'Well there were . three of us in this marriage, so it was a bit crowded' referring to . Camilla. Charles later admitted to the affair on a television interview with Jonathan Dimbleby. Camilla subsequently . announced her divorce to husband Andrew Parker Bowles in 1995 and she . and Charles resumed their relationship. They were eventually engaged to be married in 2005. Since marrying the Prince, Camilla has demonstrated ease in dealing with public appearances. None . more apparent than yesterday, when she showed off a henna tattoo on her . hand during the couple's eight-day Commonwealth tour of Tanzania. The . royal couple flew to the idyllic isle, which is a semi-autonomous part . of the country, on a private jet from its commercial capital, Dar es . Salaam. Charles and Camilla even took part in a local dance during the visit, much to the delight of onlookers. Charles swayed contentedly along to a tune played on a zumari, similar to the instrument snake-charmers use. Camilla was hot on his heels though and, clutching her white parasol, she swayed her hips to the music, while a Zanzibari woman wrapped a yellow, red and black khanga shawl around her. The couple then did an impromptu dance called the chapauringe in the searing heat within the walls of the Old Fort in Stone Town, the capital of Zanzibar.",Duchess of Cornwall intends to be known as Princess Consort .
"By . Allan Hall . Last updated at 1:25 PM on 11th November 2011 . Formula One chief Bernie Ecclestone only found out his daughter’s wedding had cost him more than £12million after the big day – because his ex-wife settled the bill and didn’t tell him. The extraordinarily high price tag for the ceremony was revealed for the first time yesterday in a German court case. It had previously been thought to have cost around £5million. Ecclestone’s youngest daughter Petra, 22, married businessman James Stunt in August at a medieval castle in the Italian town of Bracciano. The big day: Petra Ecclestone is pictured in a Rolls Royce with her father - who only found out how much the wedding had cost after it took place . Happy couple: Petra with her husband James Stunt. The pair married in August . The lavish celebration included stunning fireworks displays, acrobats performing beneath hot air balloons, £4,000 bottles of Chateau Petrus claret and a private show by chart-topping band The Black Eyed Peas. Petra’s Vera Wang wedding dress cost £80,000 and the service was accompanied by 18 members of the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra, who had been flown in for the occasion. Accompanying them was the 20-member Tenebrae Choir, described as ‘one of the greatest choirs in the world’. More than 250 VIPs attended and they were kept cool in air-conditioned flower-filled canopies in the castle grounds. Giving evidence for a second day at the fraud trial of a German banker, Ecclestone told the court: ‘Let me tell you something. When my youngest daughter said she was getting married I thought as father of the bride I should pay for the wedding. Venue: The couple married at this medieval castle in the Italian town of Bracciano and were treated to a a fireworks display and flying acrobats . Secret payments: Ecclestone admitted his lawyer in Switzerland acted as 'moneyman' when he paid £27million in blackmail cash to banker Gerhard Gribkowsky . ‘When it was suggested how much they would be spending on drinks I thought it was absurd. So I managed to upset my daughter and my wife. ‘Only later did I learn that it cost in excess of £12million which I did not find out about until later, paid by my wife, and I did not find out from her.’ Happier times: Ecclestone and ex-wife Slavica, whose trust half of the cash came from . In another startling revelation, the Munich court also heard the 81-year-old motor racing tycoon confess to having a ‘girlfriend’ during his 24-year marriage to wife Slavica. In court he constantly referred to Slavica, 53, as his wife, despite their divorce in 2009. He said the banker, Gerhard Gribkowsky, became a ‘drinking pal’ of Slavica and told how they once met in a mobile home at a race meeting where Slavica tried to extract information about her husband’s girlfriends. ‘Were there girlfriends then?’ asked the prosecutor. ‘Well, one girlfriend,’ replied Ecclestone before the questioning moved on. The Formula One boss is the star witness in the case against Gribkowsky, who is accused of corruption and tax evasion and who Ecclestone says blackmailed him out of £27million in 2006. The tycoon has not been charged with any offence but his admission that he paid out the vast sum  puts him at the centre of the corruption case. Prosecutors refused to believe that the tycoon had never discussed the ‘shakedown’ payment with his then wife, and Ecclestone used the story about the wedding bill to illustrate how he and Slavica kept business and personal spending separate. ‘I never brought my business problems home to my wife,’ he said. Gribkowsky, who was the chief risks officer for the BayernLB bank in Munich, handled the £500million sale of 47 percent of Formula One rights from the bank to London-based private equity group CVC. He was charged with fraud after he was found to have £27million in a bank account after the deal was completed. He denies all charges. Headache: Ecclestone, left, said he paid Gribkowsky, right, the cash to . make sure the 'starstruck' banker did not cause him problems with the . taxman . No expense spared: Petra's wedding featured a performance by the Black Eyed Peas and guests were served £4,000 bottles of Chateau Petrus claret . Ecclestone said he paid the cash to the banker because he feared he would ‘make me liable for a £2billion tax bill’. The tycoon said he believed Gribkowsky had become starstruck by the world of Formula One and  wanted to become his business partner. When he spurned his offers, Ecclestone claimed Gribkowsky began making noises about going to the Inland Revenue. ‘He would have landed me with a lengthy investigation, massive legal costs and I didn’t need it and so I paid to get rid of the problem,’ he said. After the hearing Ecclestone boarded a private jet to Abu Dhabi for this weekend’s grand prix. The case continues.","Formula One boss revealed wife's extravagance .

"By . Associated Press . Last updated at 8:40 AM on 11th November 2011 . The man who executed four people inside a quiet New York pharmacy during a drug robbery was sentenced Thursday to a series of life terms without parole. His wife, who drove the getaway car, received 25 years in prison. David Laffer pleaded guilty to first-degree murder in the June holdup at Haven Drugs in Medford, perhaps the most egregious case in a wave of U.S. pharmacy robberies. Convicted: David Laffer, seen here at a previous court appearance, was sentenced to five consecutive life terms - and a judge said he would recommend they be served in solitary confinement . Laffer said he committed the robbery because he had lost his job, and his wife required not only painkillers but also blood pressure medicine, anti-nausea pills and muscle relaxants. He jammed a backpack full of pills after killing the four. The victim-impact statements were so emotional that even hardened homicide officers fought back tears as they watched, but Laffer showed no emotion. Mary Moran, the grandmother of victim Jamie Taccetta, said: 'He is a dark, hell-bound soul. He is a coward. He has no soul.' Later, she looked at Laffer and said: 'Burn in hell.' Forlorn: Melinda Brady, Laffer's wife, was sentenced to 25 years in prison for driving the getaway car . Laura Bustamonte, the daughter of victim 71-year-old victim Bryon Sheffield, looked directly at Laffer and said: 'You had a gun and you didn't care who or how many people had to die for your mission to be accomplished.' Laffer, his hands cuffed behind his back, sounded sober and straightforward as he read a statement from a paper held by his lawyer. He said: 'I know that it doesn't begin to explain or excuse my horrific actions that day. 'However, if a discussion and recognition of prescription pill abuse and doctor-shopping will be generated among the public, then maybe something beneficial can come from this.' He said of the victims' families: 'To ask for forgiveness from them would be a selfish act.' Laffer's wife, Melinda Brady, had pleaded guilty to robbery charges and was sentenced Thursday to 25 years. Prosecutors said they could not prove that Brady was aware in advance that her husband planned the killings and, thus, could not charge her with murder. Heartbreak: Mary Moran, seen here clutching a photo of her granddaughter, Jamie Taccetta, who was shot and killed by David Laffer, called him a 'dark, hell-bound soul' Brady, who cried throughout the proceeding, said: 'I am so sorry for the loss of your loved ones. That awful day will haunt me for the rest of my life.' Judge James Hudson responded: 'You're more sorry for yourself than for the victims.' Daniel Taccetta, the victim's brother, said Brady was getting away with murder. 'She is just as guilty as he is,' he said. 'You are both cowards for what you did to my family,' said Tricia Taccetta, Jamie Taccetta's mother. Hudson later told Laffer: 'I promised you when you pled guilty that you could not hope for mercy and I will not disappoint you. You merit only the scorn of this community, your victim's families and this court.' Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota called the killings among the most gruesome in the history of the county, which in 1974 was the scene of the 'Amityville Horror' slayings in which a man killed six members of his own family. Suffolk County Assistant District Attorney James Chalifoux said Thursday: 'We as a society look at it and see that it could have been anybody. It could have been me. It could have been my children, or it could have been me or my wife.' Mugshots: Mr Laffer pleaded guilty to the murders, while Mrs Brady pleaded guilty to robbery, as prosecutors could not prove that she knew her husband's intentions . Laffer, a 33-year-old Army veteran, walked into Haven Drugs shortly after 10 a.m. on June 19 and opened fire without announcing a robbery, killing 45-year-old pharmacist Raymond Ferguson, who was filling in for a colleague celebrating Father's Day. He then shot 17-year-old clerk Jennifer Mejia, who was due to graduate high school days later. He then fatally shot two customers who unwittingly walked in on the carnage, authorities said. One was Sheffield, a 71-year-old retiree picking up medication for his ailing wife; the couple was planning their 50th wedding anniversary in July. The other, Taccetta, was a 33-year-old mother of two who was planning her wedding. Store surveillance video showed Laffer disguised in a scruffy beard augmented by mascara, firing at the victims. The first shot came from a .45-caliber handgun hidden in Laffer's backpack. The bullet struck Ferguson, behind the counter. Laffer then found Mejia, and shot her. Grisly case: Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas Spota called the killings among the most gruesome in the history of the county, which in 1974 was the scene of the 'Amityville Horror' murders . As he began filling a backpack with pills, Sheffield and Taccetta walked into the store and he sneaked up behind them and fired shots into their heads. He then fled with thousands of pills. Laffer has since said in a jailhouse interview that the first shot went off accidentally and when he realized what happened, he killed the others. Prosecutors say Laffer and his wife staked out several pharmacies before settling on Haven Drugs, a tiny family-owned business on an out-of-the-way suburban street. Investigators said they found parts of the disassembled weapon used in the holdup, as well as at least 2,000 hydrocodone-type pills in the couple's home, which is not far from the pharmacy. Other evidence, including the backpack and empty medicine bottles, were believed tossed out in trash bins behind businesses in the area. A shirt Laffer was seen wearing was found buried in his yard. Laffer was sentenced to five consecutive life terms. The five first-degree counts reflect the deaths of the four victims in the pharmacy, plus an umbrella charge for multiple murders. In addition, Judge Hudson said he would push that Laffer serve his sentence in solitary confinement, with no privileges. Laffer has said he expects he will be killed in prison. 'I'm not even under any illusions that I'd make it 15 years,' he told Newsday in a September interview.

"By . Hugo Gye . Last updated at 11:16 AM on 10th November 2011 . Police who raided the home of convicted sex offender Neil Waters, 50, found a DVD containing forty excerpts from films which had been screened on television . A man accused of possessing child pornography has been cleared after a judge heard his videos were taken from terrestrial TV. Police who raided the home of convicted sex offender Neil Waters, 50, found a DVD containing 40 excerpts from films which had been screened on television. None of the films was pornographic, and they could be legitimately and legally viewed by the public, Gloucester Crown Court was told. Judge Jamie Tabor ruled that whatever . motive Waters had for gathering the film clips together, they could not . be regarded as indecent within the meaning of the law. On hearing his ruling, prosecutor . Virgina Cornwall said the Crown would not continue with the nine charges . against Waters of making indecent images of children between 2008 and . 2011. Waters has been on the sex offender register since 2006 when he was jailed for child porn offences. The court heard that following the raid on his home on February 28 this year Waters, who was on parole, was recalled to prison to continue serving his sentence and he has remained behind bars since then. Ms Cornwall told Judge Tabor: 'We invite . the court to rule on the admissibility of these images. They were found . in somewhat unusual circumstances. 'The defendant was at the time a . registered sex offender who had been released from prison and was living . in the community. As a result of information received, officers . attended his home and during a search found a disc in his shed. 'That . disc contained 40 clips of principally young girls that had been taken . from films broadcast on terrestrial TV. VHS tapes were also found and it . is clear that the excerpts on the disc came from them. They were . perfectly legitimate terrestrial TV films.' Gloucester Crown Court (pictured) heard that following the raid, Waters, who was on parole, was recalled to prison to continue serving his sentence and he has remained behind bars since then . Judge Tabor said, 'I understand there was no question of them coming from pay-per-view TV, but from films any member of the public could have seen.' Ms Cornwall replied, 'Yes, they were films shown at any time without restrictions on them which are not pornographic in nature at all. They are innocuous, generally speaking.' Waters' lawyer said: 'The defendant has not purchased these images. He has just taped what has been on TV. Anyone could have recorded them.' Giving his ruling, Judge Tabor said he had viewed a selection of the clips and they were undoubtedly of children but they would not be considered by the public to be indecent nowadays - and probably would not have been seen as indecent even 30 years ago. If the case went to trial, he said, the jury would not be allowed to consider the motivation for Waters making the recordings and the disc. The children shown in the clips were 'predominately of children in semi-undressed state,' he said. 'He may well have derived some form of gratification, sexual or otherwise, by looking at scantily clad young children - for example in an aboriginal cave talking to their mother. 'But if one removes the motivation for making these clips one is left with the images themselves and one asks oneself objectively are they indecent? They are not.' Ms Cornwall offered no evidence on the nine charges in the light of the judge's ruling and Waters was formally found not guilty.","Judge Tabor: 'I understand there was no question of them coming from pay-per-view TV, but from films any member of the public could have seen'"
"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 1:58 PM on 11th November 2011 . Just days before TV doctor Phil McGraw will announce the results of Rebecca Zahau's second autopsy, it has been revealed that the twin sister of Jonah Shacknai's ex-wife was at the mansion in the hours leading up to her death. Nina Romano, whose sister was married to Miss Zahau's Billionaire boyfirend before they divorced several years ago, said she went to the house in San Diego to get answers about six-year-old Max's death. That same day, on July 13, Miss Zahau, 32, was said to have committed suicide at 3am  after hearing that her step-son Max - who . had been injured in an accident at the Coronado home days earlier - was about . to die. Scroll down for video . Mysterious: The family of Rebecca Zahau are working with TV psychologist Dr Phil to investigate her death . Tragic: Max Shacknai died after his fall but a doctor allegedly said he may have suffocated . Miss Zahau's naked body was found . hanging from the mansion's balcony with her ankles and wrists bound. Her . death was later ruled a suicide but her family have always maintained she was murdered. The Zahau family attorney previously . claimed that it was Mr Shacknai's ex-wife Dina who was at the mansion, but a . source close to the investigation told Radar there was 'irrefutable . evidence' that she was actually at the hospital by her son's bedside. Nina Romano told the CBS affiliate in . San Diego earlier this week that she went to the house to get answers . about Max's accident. She was staying at her sister's house, which is . in close proximity to the mansion. Family: Max pictured with his aunt, Nina Romano - the twin sister of Mr Shacknai's ex-wife, Dina . New evidence? Ms Romano, 41, was at the mansion shortly before Miss Zahau's death, but said she knocked on the door and left shortly after no one answered . Conflicting reports: An eyewitness has told police he saw Max's mother, Dina, and not her twin sister, at the mansion that night . Recalling a conversation she had with . Miss Zahau two days before her body was found, she told CBS: 'I said . to her, ""Rebecca what happened? I heard Maxie was walking up the stairs . and he had a cardiac arrest. That makes no sense to me"". 'I said, ""He's a six year old boy. He's a . healthy boy. He plays soccer. He plays sports. I don't understand"". 'And . (Rebecca) just looked at me and she said, ""I know"". And I said, ""Okay, well, where did he fall from? Did he fall from the . first set of stairs, the little landing, the stairs going up, the top . landing by the bedrooms, where did he fall from?"" 'She said twice, ""He fell from the bedroom. He fell from the bedroom"". 'And I looked at her and said, ""How do you know that? I thought you . didn't see him."" And there was no answer.' During the two-hour interview . detailing events, the 41-year-old said that she simply went over there that night . for an explanation and for Miss Zahau to show her where she found Max. She said: 'I just wanted to see for . myself. That's why I went there. I just wanted her to show me how she . found him because I didn't understand. Scene: Miss Zahau, 32, was found nude with her wrists and feet bound with rope at Mr Shacknai's San Diego home (pictured here) 'I went up to the front door and rang the bell, nothing; rang the bell a second time, nothing. I knocked on the door. 'I looked through the glass, nothing. It didn't look like anybody was home. The kitchen was dark, everything was dark. 'So I thought, that's kind of strange . because her car's here; that light's on, that's weird. So then I just . thought, ""Maybe she just doesn't want to talk to me"". 'So, I turned around and I left right away and I walked back to my sister's house, got ready for bed and went to sleep.' Nina Romano was the last person to text Miss Zahau, asking if she could come over. Miss Zahau did not reply. On Monday and Tuesday Miss Zahau's family will appear on the Dr Phil show, along with the family attorney.

"By . Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 9:33 AM on 10th November 2011 . As many a forecaster will cheerfully admit, predicting the weather isn’t an exact science. But the Met Office is about to try to make it that little bit more precise with a new format. Rather than telling us that rain, sun or snow will be ‘likely’ or ‘very likely’, they will use percentages to describe the probabilities of what the weather could be. 100% chance of rain: Hundreds of golf spectators huddle beneath their umbrellas at the Royal St Georges Golf Course, Kent, in July this year . So, for example, tomorrow’s forecast could tell you there is a 45 per cent chance of rain. The Met Office said the system would ‘empower people to make their own decisions’ based on the information available. But anyone who’s ever been caught in an unexpected downpour may feel they have simply come up with a way to deflect blame when they get it wrong. In the U.S., forecasts often outline multiple scenarios for what could happen, so people have to make up their own minds as to whether to brave a day out, or stay home. Yesterday the minister who oversees the Met Office, Edward Davey, told MPs that an American-style system of percentages was the ‘direction of travel’. The system is being tested on a separate Met Office website to gain public feedback, and is expected to be launched formally next year. The information on it includes ‘probability of precipitation’ – rain, sleet or snow – the percentage of humidity, wind speed and a UV level between one and ten indicating how strong the sun will be. Edward Davey, who oversees the Met Office, told MPs that an American-style system of percentages was the 'direction of travel' It also gives actual temperatures and what it ‘feels like’ taking into account these factors. Consumer affairs minister Mr Davey told the Commons Science and Technology committee: ‘The Met Office is working with a number of people to look at how best to get over those risks and probabilities. ‘We do know that other countries use percentages to try to get  that over. On the website they are beginning to use a lot of probability data, fan charts and so forth, so this is the direction of travel. ‘But if we do move away from “it is likely to rain” or “it is very likely to be foggy” or the phrases we see and hear on our TV screens, we need to make sure where we end up is something the British public feel happy with and are able to use in their daily lives.’ Met Office spokesman Dan Williams said: ‘It would mean the public can assess the likelihood of what they do. Instead of us saying it is likely to rain, it will empower people to make their own decisions based on the best information we’ve got.’ He said that broadcasters such as the BBC would have to decide whether or not to use the probabilities in their weather reports. In 2009, the Met Office came under fire for predicting a barbecue summer which turned out to be a washout, then months later was accused of failing to warn the public of the coldest winter for  30 years. As a result, it ditched its 90-day seasonal forecasts.",Met Office says it will 'empower people to make their own decisions'
"Reality stars have recorded a Christmas charity cover of 'Last Christmas' By . Andrea Magrath and Georgina Littlejohn . Last updated at 7:31 AM on 9th November 2011 . They are no strangers to an old fashioned feud, with plenty of experience from their own constant onscreen bickering. So the cast of The Only Way is Essex knew exactly how to issue a low blow to their current nemesis, footballer Joey Barton, during an ongoing war of words on Twitter. Taking a break from recording their Christmas charity single in London this afternoon, the cast posed for a rude photo mocking the 29-year-old sportsman. 'Jel Joey': The cast of TOWIE mocked footballer Joey Barton today by posting this picture on Twitter . While the reality stars are almost always engaged in some argument at any one time within their group, they banded together yesterday to take on the footballer after he launched a scathing attack on them. The cast, including Joey Essex, Lydia Bright, Sam and Billie Faiers, Chloe Sims and Maria Fowler, held their pinky fingers up for the camera. Mario Falcone went one further, gesturing with his middle finger, while Nanny Pat held a sign that read 'Jel (slang for jealous) Joey Barton.' Members of the group then posted the snap on Twitter. Boys will be boys: Barton took a break from the feud he sparked on Twitter on Monday night to go paintballing . The move only reignited Barton's rant last night, with the QPR player targeting other celebrities and fans who waded into the fight to support the TOWIE gang. 'Isnt it quite obsurd (sic) that all these z-listers stick up for each other regardless of the show their on? Must think it'll get them a Daz advert,' he wrote. After lashing out at a number of Twitter users, he ended his tirade with: 'Right people time to leave u. Take the high ground, there's a Z-list lynch mob outside burning pitchfolks with Asda t shirts on.' Charity single: The cast spent the day recording a cover of Last Christmas . Meanwhile, the TOWIE cast got back to work on their charity single, filming the video in a West London studio. James 'Arg' Argent announced the news on Twitter. He wrote yesterday: 'The Only Way Is Essex Have officially recorded a Charity Xmas Single covering Wham's “Last Christmas”! Gona be so funny #Towie4XmasNo1 !!!!!' The reality stars were dressed up in red, white and gold to perform the hit song, with crooner Argent as their leader. Break: Gemma Collins and Chloe Sims were spotted dressed to the nines outside the studio during a break from recording the single . Long day: Joey was seen arriving at the studios in casual wear, while co-star Mario Falcone was pictured leaving hours later . They weren't letting the attack from Barton dampen their holiday spirit as they belted out the hit song, which will be released on the charts in time for Christmas. The war of words began last night shortly after Barton attended the Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 launch party along with several members of the TOWIE gang. Rather than keep to himself and enjoy a night off from the day job, Barton, who doesn't exactly have the best reputation himself, launched a barrage of digs in their direction. Party season: Frankie Essex wore a red satin frock and leopard heels, while Nanny Pat was lovely as ever in a white dress . But, rather cowardly, he didn't . actually put them down to their face - but decided to rant about them on . his Twitter page instead. He . started by noting that his fellow guests were a bunch of 'strange . z-list celebs' and added: 'Just for the record the TOWIE helmets were . there, all of them together. FREAKS.' But TOWIE's James 'Arg' Argent was having . none of it and responded: 'Only person there that everyone looked down . on is u. Should we beat our TOWIE cast mates up & go down for you to . like us!? Mug!' Barton replied: 'Leave it u stonehenge teeth. Cheeky man giving it bigguns, leave it large undies.' Uncalled for:  Barton attended the launch of Call of Duty: MW3 in London last night where he saw the TOWIE stars, including James 'Arg' Argent, which sparked his scathing Twitter attack . Arg's best friend and fellow TOWIE star Mark Wright wasn't at the computer game launch as he had dinner plans with his family. But that didn't stop him getting involved as he took to his Twitter page to defend his friend and put Barton in his place. He wrote: 'Joey where can I get ur hair cut ? Also u no that arg wants he's teeth done so thanks 4 watching the show!!' Barton replied: 'Same place u get them speedo's. Ur sister still collecting footballers like panini stickers???' Didn't want to say it to their face? Barton's Twitter feed shows some of the insults directed at Argent and Wright . Online rant: Barton's digs continued long after Wright, Essex and Argent signed off . Mark laughed it off and wrote, 'Is . that all you got haha. Good night silly nuts', but Barton got angry and . decided to insult Mark's grandmother instead, telling him: 'Nanny pat . same knashers as that white horse u rode in on.' Still . determined not to rise to it, Mark concluded: 'Haha u even know the . white horse I rode in on. U must b watching. @joey7barton #TOWIE no1 . fan! Last message I waste on u, u complete lunch.' Joey Essex also decided to tell Barton off and wrote on his Twitter page, 'Go to bed mate, it's 1 in the morning', but Barton told him: 'Don't u start. Go and tell that bird u love her and get a massive ""nice guy"" jog on.' Fighting back: Wright wasn't going to let Barton insult his friends and family - but also rose above it by trying to laugh it off . Mark and Joey then signed off the row . and refused to get drawn into it further but Barton would not let it . lie and carried on making nasty remarks about the cast and the show. He . wrote: 'TOWIE firm don't mess with big boys, u and ur shallow, fake, . pretentious lifestyles. In a year u'll be opening sh***y poundshops if . ur lucky. 'FYI- TOWIE retards.....""Pretentious"" google it if ur struggling......Off to bed, keep me updated people with the TOWIE blerts, all thats wrong with the world that mob, I'll take great pleasure in abusing them.' You tell him, Arg! The crooner tried to put Barton in his place on his Twitter page . Award-winning: Arg points out that TOWIE has won a prestigious gong . One step further: Arg then posted a picture poking fun at Barton's hairstyle . Arg couldn't resist one last attempt to shut Barton up before signing off and wrote: 'Someone looks like they've watched the . show more then we have! Night #TOWIE fans! Wanna put us down? All we . need to say is one word.. BAFTA!' But that wound Barton up even further, . and he added: 'Told u to leave didn't I, right fatty now ur fair game. Can't believe ur giving it with them teeth like a burnt down fence. 'I actually despise the whole of that . firm, mentally deficient, turn up at the opening of an envelope, fame . hungry, prized b*** bags.' He wouldn't let it lie: Barton kept digging at the TOWIE gang long after he left the party . Barton, who has been described as one of the dirtiest players in the Premiership, has twice been convicted of violence, the first in May 2008 when he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray after he was caught on CCTV in Liverpool knocking a man to the ground before straddling him and punching him four or five times as his cousin threw food at the victim. Minutes later Barton attacked a 16-year-old boy and left him with broken teeth and served 77 days of the prison term. In July 2008, he was given a four month suspended sentence after he pleaded guilty to a violent attack on Manchester City teammate Ousmane Dabo during a row at the club's training ground. This effectively finished his career at the club where, four years earlier, he stubbed a lit cigar out on the eye of teammate and youth player Jamie Tandy and was fined six weeks wages, which amounted to about £60,000. Thug: Barton is known for his violent outbursts on the pitch too and is seen here squaring up to Arsenal's Gervinho during one of his last games for Newcastle before he moved to QPR this summer .",Reality stars have recorded a Christmas charity cover of 'Last Christmas'
"By . Rebecca English, Royal Correspondent . Last updated at 12:57 PM on 11th November 2011 . Prince William will undertake a six-week tour of duty in the Falkland Islands early next year, the 30th anniversary of the conflict. The future king, an RAF Search and Rescue pilot, will fly to the South Atlantic in February for the posting without his new wife. The timing of William’s deployment is hugely sensitive and is certain to antagonise the Argentinan government, which continues to assert a territorial claim to the islands despite defeat at the hands of British forces in 1982. Keen to go: Prince William at the controls of a Sea King helicopter, which he will be co-piloting on a six-week tour of the Falklands early next year . Talked at length: The Prince and his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, pictured on a visit to a UNICEF centre in Copenhagen on November 2, will be apart for nearly two months. But she is said to be very supportive . Two years ago Argentina's foreign . minister, Jorge Taina, condemned suggestions the prince would be posted, . saying: ‘This only serves to once again highlight Britain's ongoing . military presence in land and sea areas that are part of the Argentine . Republic's national territories.’ William, referred to in the RAF as Flight Lieutenant Wales, has always made clear, however, he is keen to go. According to sources, the prince does not want to be singled out for any special treatment and the posting will, significantly, count towards his bid for promotion to captain. He is currently working as a Sea King co-pilot. He has also discussed the issue with his wife, the Duchess of Cambridge, as it will be the longest they have ever been apart. Kate, though, considers herself ‘very much a military wife’ and is said to have been ‘overwhelmingly supportive’ of his decision. For his part the prince is said to be looking forward to the posting. ‘He just wants to get on with his job,’ a source said. The Ministry of Defence was at pains to stress last night that this was very much a ‘routine deployment’ - although it will, conveniently, allow the prince to be back in the country well before the actual anniversary of Argentina’s invasion, on April 2, and the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations in June. A spokesman further insisted that the decision to send the prince, who will be one of a crew of four sent from RAF Valley on Anglesey, North Wales, was one taken solely by his RAF chain of command. In a statement the department said: ‘The RAF can confirm that Flight Lieutenant (Flt Lt) William Wales, Search and Rescue Co-pilot, 22 Squadron, RAF Valley will complete a routine deployment to the Falkland Islands as part of a crew of four RAF personnel during the period February – March 2012. ‘This deployment forms part of a normal squadron crew rotation and will form part of Flt Lt Wales’ training and career progression as a Search and Rescue pilot within the RAF.’ Victory: British soldiers fly the Union flag over port Howard, West Falkland, on June 16, 1982. Simultaneously, another flies in the islands' capital Port Stanley, signifying the end of the Falklands conflict . In the family: Prince Andrew grins broadly at Port Stanley in his capacity as a Sea King pilot during the conflict. He opened RAF Mount Pleasant, where Prince William will be based, in 1985 . Defeat: Argentine prisoners of war amassed in Port Stanley after their surrender to the British Falkland Islands Task Force. Prince Willliam will be deployed there on the 30th anniversary of the war . They also stressed that the prince would not be carrying out any royal duties while he was there. The spokesman added: ‘Flt Lt Wales is one of 38,000 RAF personnel, all of whom are regularly and routinely deployed abroad. It is part of the job A six week deployment to the Falklands is conventional for such pilots at this stage of their career.’ The Foreign and Commonwealth Office insisted it was simply co-incidence that the prince was being deployed during the 30th anniversary of the war. ‘It is a routine deployment and just so happens to fall in the 30th anniversary. It was not planned in any way. Obviously we value our relationship with Argentina and these things are taken into consideration but it is simply that the deployment rotation has fallen in this way,’ a spokesman said. Two RAF Search and Rescue (SAR) crews are based in the Falklands at any one time and pilots routinely deploy on a rolling basis as part of their training and career development. Provocative: The Prince's deployment may be seen as antagonistic, but David Cameron says sovereignty of the islands is non-negotiable . A SAR crew consists of two pilots, a winch/radar operator and a winchman. The team provides 24-hour cover and support for British forces in the region as well as providing an extra rescue and life-saving facility for islanders and shipping in the area. William will travel to the British sovereignty 8,000 miles away in early February – just after his wife’s 30th birthday – and return to the UK in March. RAF Mount Pleasant, where he will be based, was opened in 1985 by the Duke of York, who was famously a Sea King pilot in the 1982 war. Andrew was based on Invincible flying on missions that included anti-submarine warfare and casualty evacuation. He witnessed the Argentinian attack on the civilian container ship, SS ‘Atlantic Conveyor’ and was one of the first to take off survivors. Mount Pleasant, 30 miles south west of the islands' capital, Port Stanley, is home to up to 2,000 British military personnel. Conditions are said to be ‘bleak’ and the base has been dubbed ‘the death star’ due to its confusing layout. The prince will have to take his own toilet roll and be prepared for plagues of mice and mites in his living quarters. His accommodation will be furnished with a simple single bed and shared bathroom facilities. William will be advised to take plenty of warm clothing as the islands can experience ‘all four seasons in just one day’ and shoes in good repair because there are no cobblers. The base does have a range of sporting activities to alleviate boredom, but the golf course in Port Stanley has no greens and players need to negotiate a mine field. Mail normally arrives twice a week and the Duchess will have to write ‘blueys’, like other forces’ wives.","Prince will fly out in January after spending Christmas with the Duchess of Cambridge .

Aspiring stand-up comedian Jeffrey Lluis once cracked jokes about committing crimes in a YouTube video. But it was no laughing matter when he allegedly carried out the gag in real life by robbing the same Florida bank TWICE in a week. Lluis, 27, implied he would 'blow the bank up' unless he was given cash by the teller at the  SunTrust branch in Citrus Park, Tampa, say police . Then two days later, wearing the same hat and dark glasses, he said to startled staff: 'It's me again.' However, police had the last laugh when he was held after two bank employees picked him out from a line up of suspects. 'They (bank staff) recognized him before he even . announced the robbery,' Captain Andy Ross said. 'I wouldn't think he's . thinking it's very funny right now.' A detective quizzed Lluis about the first raid when investigators noticed a strong resemblance between him and the suspect after they reviewed a surveillance tape. But Lluis, who was on probation for cocaine possession, robbery and two counts of uttering a forged instrument, wasn't arrested. The next day the SunTrust Bank was hit again.

"By . Mail Foreign Service . Last updated at 4:33 PM on 10th November 2011 . An eight-year-old girl is believed to be among 15 killed in Syria today amid fresh violence. The deaths - and those of six soldiers - occurred in fighting in Homs, which has become the epicentre of the uprising, a human rights group claimed. In some of the day's attacks, security forces opened fire as they conducted raids in search of dissidents. Death on the streets: A home video clip from an amateur video given to the Ugarit News group today claims to show an anti-Assad supporter lying dead next to a car in Damascus yesterday . There also were reports of fighting between soldiers and army defectors. The UN estimates some 3,500 people have been killed in the Syrian crackdown on dissent over the past eight months. In Washington, some Arab leaders told the United States they were willing to provide safe haven to Syrian President Bashar al-Assad to hasten his 'inevitable' departure from power after seven months of protests. Assistant Secretary of State Jeffrey Feltman would not identify the countries that had come forward. But he told a Senate panel: . 'Almost all the Arab leaders, foreign ministers who I talk to say the . same thing: Assad's rule is coming to an end. It is inevitable,' Fury: A protester holds up a burning picture of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in Vienna today . He hoped Assad and his inner circle would 'head for the exits voluntarily.' Assad has shown no sign of leaving. Today's violence follows the deaths of at least eight protesters and . injured 25 in Damascus yesterday. More than 60 people have been killed . by the army and security forces just since last week, when Assad's . government signed a peace plan sponsored by the Arab League. Western governments led by the United States have called on Assad to quit office. Feltman said the U.S. would continue . to support the Syrian opposition while diplomatically and financially . pressuring the regime. U.S. and European financial sanctions were 'tightening the financial noose around the regime,' he added. 'He must go': Syrian President Bashar al-Assad and Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman spells out the U.S. position to a Senate panel yesterday . But the United States did not seek militarisation of the conflict: 'Syria is not Libya.' Washington favoured multilateral sanctions on Syria at the United Nations, Feltman said, adding that he would consider other steps if Russia and China continued to block a Security Council resolution condemning Syria. He wanted to see European-led efforts to introduce a resolution in the UN General Assembly's human rights committee that would insist on access to Syria for internationally recognised human rights monitors. He feared the transition to democracy in Syria could be long and difficult. Feltman also added that U.S. company, Blue Coat Systems Inc, was being probed by the commerce department over suspicions its products had had made their way to Syria despite strict trade embargoes. Blue Coat, of Sunnyvale, California, said in a statement on its website that some of its equipment apparently had been 'transferred illegally ' to Syria, but that it did not know who was using the devices or exactly how. It said the company was co-operating with the U.S. government investigation.","Eight more dead in Homs today .

"Jonah Shacknai sells mansion where his girlfriend was found dead for an 'undisclosed amount' By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:15 PM on 2nd November 2011 . The lawyer representing the family of Rebecca Zahau, who was found hanging naked at Jonah Shacknai's mansion, is in talks over a book on the high-profile case. Miss Zahau, 32, was found dead two days after her Mr Shacknai's six-year-old son, Max toppled over a balcony railing at the top of a staircase at the San Diego home. He died later that week from head injuries. Lawyer Anne Bremner has been hired by the Zahau family to spearhead efforts to get the investigation reopened after it was controversially ruled that Miss Zahau, who was found nude with her wrists tied on July 13, committed suicide. Tragic: Rebecca Zahau was found hanging naked and bound at her boyfriend Jonah Shacknai's mansion . Ms Bremner, who has a history of adapting her high profile cases into books, has been in recent talks with a literary agent and a crime author, according to a report by ABC News. Ann Rule, the author of 32 non-fiction . books about homicide and other crimes, told ABC News that she . recently met with Ms Bremner and discussed the . possibility of writing a book about the Zahau family.. Ms Rule said: 'The probability of writing a book about the Zahaus, however, is about . '50/50 -– if charges were brought. It's a difficult thing . because the little boy's father is very, very wealthy so for legal . reasons it's kind of a mine field.' Ms Bremner said she is 'a huge fan' of Ms Rule, adding, 'I believe Ann can help us find the answers that we seek.' The Zahua family and Ms Bremner have established two websites about Miss Zahau, one of which asks for donations and is overseen by literary manager Sharlene Martin of Martin Literary Management in Seattle. In a tweet on October 28 she wrote, 'Been working with Anne Bremner on the Rebecca Zahau case for 2 months. Help us find the truth athttp://www.RebeccaZahauFund.com PLEASE!' Ms Martin told ABC News there is no Zahau book currently in the works, but if there was her agency would handle it. Book: Seattle lawyer Anne Bremner, who is representing the Zachau family, is in talks over a book on Rebecca's case . For sale: Spreckels mansion owned by Jonah Shacknai is up for sale after his girlfriend and son both died at the San Diego property . Pharmaceuticals tycoon Mr Shacknai, 54, who has kept a low profile since the deaths, refused to comment on plans for a book. The news comes after it emerged that Mr Shacknai has sold his lavish mansion where both his girlfriend was found dead. The Spreckels mansion was sold to an investment group for an undisclosed amount but they plan to put the home on the market later this week for $14.5 million, according to RadarOnline. Real estate agent Scott Aurich told . the Coronado Patch that Mr Shacknai had originally bought the house for . $13 million but the value dropped to $7 million. Happier times: Jonah Shacknai and his girlfriend Rebecca Zahau lived at the lavish historic mansion in the San Diego area . Speaking of Mr Shacknai, the agent said: 'He's done.' Miss Zahau's family had her body exhumed . last week, allegedly paid for by TV star and psychologist Dr Phil . McGraw, to look for further evidence of foul play. The forensic pathologist who conducted the second autopsy said coroners 'rushed to judgement' on ruling the death of Rebecca Zahau a suicide. Fatal fall: Max Shacknai, 6, also died at the house after falling from a balcony . Senior forensic pathologist Dr Cyril Wecht has called those results into question - giving the Zahaus fresh hope the investigation into her . Although authorities closed the case into Miss Zahau's death, they have said if new evidence comes to light they will reopen it. The Zahau family plans to discuss the findings with Dr Wecht on Dr Phil this month during sweeps week, reports the network. Miss Zahau's sister, Snowem Horwath, told ABC News the family paid for the exhumation, which can cost up to $10,000 'through the generosity of others'; she said that Dr Wecht donated his services. Miss Zahau's death came two days after Mr Shacknai's son, Max, was found unconscious at the base of the stairs at his father's vacation home in California. However, questions have been raised about that ruling as well. The boy's physician, Dr Brad Peterson of Rady’s Children’s Hospital, was quoted in a search warrant saying suffocation may have occurred prior his fall. His neck was broken and he was found not breathing and with no pulse by Miss Zahau at the bottom of the stairs after she heard a noise and came to look. Miss Zahau and her teenage sister Xena were the only people at home at the time of Max's accident. Police contend that Rebecca was in the bathroom at the time of Max's accident, and that Xena was in the shower. Mr Shacknai has two children with his first wife, Kimberly. Max was his only child with his second wife, Dina, whom he divorced in 2008.",Jonah Shacknai sells mansion where his girlfriend was found dead for an 'undisclosed amount'

"By . Michael Zennie . Last updated at 6:35 PM on 11th November 2011 . Joe Paterno contacted a powerful Washington defense attorney, one day after Penn State University fired him in connection with the sex abuse scandal that rocked the university and college football fans across the country. The legendary head football coach hasn't been charged in connection with the crimes and is listed as a cooperating witness into the case against former assistant coach Jerry Sandusky. Sandusky, who was once the top choice to succeed Paterno as head of the Penn State football program, is accused of molesting eight boys over 15 years - including some at university practice facilities. Worried: Joe Paterno reached out to a powerful defense lawyer because he's concerned about the potential for criminal charges and likely civil lawsuits . The 84-year-old Mr Paterno is concerned about new investigations by the Pennsylvania Attorney General's Office, as well as his liability in civil lawsuits from Sandusky's alleged victims and their families, NBC News reported. Analysts have predicted Penn State's liability from the scandal, and alleged cover-up, could cost the university $100 to $250 million. A a result, Mr Paterno's advisers reached out to J. Sedwick Sollers, a Washington defense lawyer who represented President George H.W. Bush during the Iran-Contra scandal. Powerful lawyer: Sedwick Sollers, the Washington defense attorney Mr Paterno reportedly contacted, represented President George H.W. Bush in the 1980s . Mr Sollers has not met with the former coach yet and not official retainer agreement has been signed, according to NBC News. As a result of the allegations, Mr Paterno could lose his chance at receiving the nation's highest civilian award. Pennsylvania . Sens. Pat Toomey, a Republican, and Bob Casey, a Democrat, both pulled . their nominations for the coach to receive the Presidential Medal of . Freedom, citing the recent scandal. Republican Rep. Glenn Thompson, who . also nominated Mr Paterno, wouldn't say Thursday whether he would . withdraw his support, as well. The politicians submitted Mr Paterno's . name in September for the award, citing his contributions to athletics . and higher education. Rocked: The sex abuse charges against former Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky brought Mr Paterno's storied career to a screeching halt . Also arrested: Athletic director Tim Curley (left) and vice-president for finance and business Gary Schultz (right) were charged with failing to report the allegations to police . In . 2002, assistant coach Mike McQueary, who was a graduate assistant at . the time, saw Sandusky molesting a 10-year-old boy in the showers at a . football practice center and reported what he witnessed to Mr Paterno, . according to a grand jury indictment. Paterno told athletic director Tim . Curley and vice-president for finance and business Gary Schultz, who . failed to report the incident to police, authorities said. Both Curley and Schultz have been arrested and charged with a cover-up. All three men say they are innocent of the charges. On . Wednesday Penn State trustees fired Mr Paterno and university president . Graham Spanier for not doing enough to stop and report the alleged . abuse. More trouble: Prosecutors in San Antonio, Texas, are investigating whether Sandusky abused a boy during the 1999 Alamo Bowl. It was Sandusky's last game and he was carried off the field by his players . Mr McQueary will keep his job at Penn . State, but will not coach in Saturday's game against Nebraska. University officials have said it is for his own protection, as he has . received threats since news of his involvement broke. Sandusky's lawyer, Joseph Amendola . disputes the 23-page grand jury indictment, which includes graphic . testimony, and has claimed his client is being unfairly tried in the . court of public opinion. The . arrests, firings and allegations of sex abuse left the university . stunned. Mr Paternoc has been at Penn State for 45 years and holds the . record for the most wins of any coach in Division 1 college football. More . than 4,000 Penn State students rioted in the streets after news the . trustees sacked Mr Paterno. They burned fliers, tore down light posts . and tipped over a news van. Riots: More than 4,000 students rioted after Mr Paterno's firing Wednesday. Thousands more poured into the streets to protest the move . The students threw rocks and bottles at police, who eventually used pepper spray to disperse the crowd. The support for Mr Paterno could take . an embarrassing turn at the game Saturday, when friends and family of . the Penn State football players wear white to honor their former coach, . called 'JoePa.' However, . that plan could compete with fans, who plan to wear baby blue in support . of Sandusky's alleged victims, according to TMZ.com. Legal trouble in the sex abuse case could extend far beyond Pennsylvania. The . district attorney in San Antonio, Texas, is considering bringing . charges against Sandusky after he traveled to the city for the 1999 . Alamo Bowl, the last game before his retirement, according to the San . Antonio Express-News. Forever changed: Students view a mural at Penn State that once included a painting of Sandusky. However, his image his since been removed, replaced with an empty chair . “Victim . 4 was listed, along with Sandusky's wife, as a member of Sandusky's . family party for the 1998 Outback Bowl and the 1999 Alamo Bowl,” the . indictment states. “... Sandusky did threaten to send him home from the . Alamo Bowl in Texas when Victim 4 resisted his advances.” The U.S. Department of Education is also investigating whether anyone in the case violated at federal law known as the Clery Act, which requires colleges and universities to publish information about criminal offenses that are reported to school authorities. Education Secretary Arne Duncan said in a statement: 'If it turns out that some people at the school knew of the abuse and did nothing or covered it up, that makes it even worse. Schools and school officials have a legal and moral responsibility to protect children and young people from violence and abuse.'","Storied coach loses support for Presidential Medal of Freedom .

The 14-year-old son of a 'hero' police traffic officer who died as he helped a stranded motorist on a motorway hard shoulder was in tears as he followed his father's coffin at his funeral service. Ben Goodlad clutched the white-topped police cap of PC Mark Goodlad, 41, as he walked into Wakefield Cathedral, past an honour guard of scores of the officer's colleagues from West Yorkshire Police. The misty centre of Wakefield came to a stop as the funeral cortege, which was led by police motorcyclists and horses, drew up outside the cathedral, between lines of officers. A father and husband: Ben Goodlad, 14, was in tears as he watched the procession alongside and his mother Helen . A hero: PC Mark Goodlad's son Ben, 14, and widow, Helen watch as his coffin is carried out of Wakefield Cathedral after the funeral . Ben and PC Goodlad's widow, Helen, travelled behind the hearse in a marked police traffic car. Members of the public joined the lines of police outside as the family followed the coffin through the main doors of the cathedral. Among the officers outside was West Yorkshire Police's chief constable Sir Norman Bettison who also read a eulogy at the packed service. Sir Norman said the dedication PC Goodlad showed on October 24, when he died as he helped a woman who was stranded on the hard shoulder of the M1 near Wakefield, was typical of him. He told the congregation: 'He would put on his uniform and the cap that now sits on his coffin, and go out to face risk, threat and harm wherever they arose. 'After a gruelling, exhausting night shift he would do it all over again the following day. 'That is what police officers, special constables and PCSOs do the length and breadth of this magnificent force and that is why I am able to say that it is my honour to speak today about our departed colleague Mark Goodlad. 'He stands for what is best in all of us. Tribute in numbers: Led by mounted officers, the funeral procession makes its way through a guard of honour .

The police car and the Suzuki were both stationary on the hard shoulder. PC Goodlad was between the two vehicles, helping the 51-year-old female Suzuki driver. The woman suffered minor injuries in the incident. Crash scene: PC Goodlad, 41, was killed on the hard shoulder of the M1 while helping a stranded motorist .

The mother of one of Jerry Sandusky’s alleged child sex assault victims said she is infuriated by the lack of action taken against the former coach and revealed her son is still traumatized by the alleged abuse. 'Victim number one' told his mother that he didn't feel he had any power to resist the former Penn State assistant football coach, telling her 'you can't say no to Jerry' and was too shamed to come forward sooner. As well as the 40 counts against him in Pennsylvania, prosecutors in Texas say they have opened an investigation into the possibility of also filing charges, following the release of grand jury testimony . indicating Sandusky may have sexually assaulted one of his young victims . when Penn State was in San Antonio for the 1999 Alamo Bowl.

The man testified that when he resisted Sandusky's advances, the coach threatened to 'send him home'. The mother of 'victim number one' spoke to Good Morning America and said she was horrified when she heard the details about what allegedly took place in the basement of Sadusky's home and at the school. Anonymous: Mother of 'victim number one' said she is horrified by the abuse that took place and infuriated that nothing was done sooner .

I was absolutely . horrified. I knew some . details but I didn't know that it was that, I didn't know it was that . bad. It's caused a lot of nightmares, for him and I both.' She said she first became suspicious when her son asked her about researching 'sex weirdos' online to see if the former coach was on there. Baseball legend Cal Ripken Jr has asked that Second Mile, a charity allegedly used by former Penn State football assistant Jerry Sandusky to meet and then molest young boys, to remove his name from its website and other literature. Before Thursday, his name was under the heading 'Board of Directors: Honorary Board' and has now been taken off. According to spokesman John Maroon, the Hall of Fame former Oriole spoke at an event benefiting the charity but did so at the behest of a corporate partner of the Cal Ripken S. Foundation. After speaking, Ripken had his name listed on the website but did not do further work with the organization. Former Notre Dame football coach Lou Holtz also had his name removed from the Second Mile's site, while legendary golfer Arnold Palmer, Philadelphia Eagles coach Andy Reid and actor Mark Wahlberg did not. She recalls: 'I asked my son if there was . something he needed to tell me, if there was something going on. It . wasn't 'til a month later when he indicated he was uncomfortable with . leaving the school with him, and (Sandusky) pulling him out of classes . at school. 'I have no idea how this went on for so long. But I want justice, I want him to be locked up. There is no help for someone who does this.' Her son was just 11 years old when he first met Sandusky and would often stay at his home alone in the basement. High school administrators have also admitted that he would pull her son out of class for unsupervised visits and a wrestling coach said he saw Sandusky lying on top of the child in an empty weights room. When she spoke to her son about it, she revealed: 'I said to him: ""You know, maybe we should have come to this conclusion earlier, you should have told me"". 'He was like, ""Well, I didn’t know what to do. I didn’t know what to do, and you just can’t tell Jerry no"". 'I'm infuriated. Even if they had the . slightest inclination that anything inappropriate was going on it should . have been reported, or at least brought to my attention. 'I didn't even know he was leaving the school with my . child, taking him out of classes. They never told me that.' According to the grand jury report detailing the 40 counts of sexual abuse facing Sandusky, the coach had the boy stay overnight at his home, took him to professional and college sporting events and showered him with gifts, 'including golf clubs, a computer, gym clothes, dress clothes and cash'. Worried: Joe Paterno reached out to a powerful . defense lawyer because he's concerned about the potential for criminal . charges and likely civil lawsuits . Perjury charge: Penn State Athletic Director Tim Curley, left, and VP for finance and business Gary Schultz . The grand jury in the Texas case, involving 'victim number four' also indicates that Sandusky showered him with gifts and told him he would be considered as a walk-on player at Penn State if he agreed to his sexual advances. Fitting title: Amazon reviewers lashed out at Jerry Sandusky's book Touched, which was released in 2001 . Bexar County First Assistant District Attorney Cliff Herberg says, although authorities are investigating, they don't have a lot to go on. 'All we have at this point is an allegation contained in an indictment from another jurisdiction,' Mr Herberg said today. 'So we have no evidence, we have no case, we have no complainant yet. 'We will have to determine the quality of the evidence, given that it (is) from 1999, on whether we can pursue a case.' The scandal over the charges in Pennsylvania led to the firing this week of legendary football coach Joe Paterno and university president Graham Spanier. Since the scandal emerged, a book written by Sandusky in 2001 has been thrust into the spotlight again. 'Touched', which is available to buy on Amazon, tells the story of the former coach's life in his own words. A synopsis on Amazon said: 'From his childhood to his professional career, this book goes behind the scenes to explore the successes and challenges that Jerry Sandusky has faced in life, both on and off the football field. 'The book also explores Sandusky's involvement in children's charities, including the founding of his charity, Second Mile.

A gang of internet 'cyber bandits'  who stole $14 million after hacking into at least 4 million computers in an online advertising scam have been arrested following a joint investigation by the FBI and Nasa. Estonian-based cyber criminals the Rove Group infected computers in over 100 countries with a software virus that redirected users to online advertising or websites. The operation was first discovered by workers at space agency Nasa's New York office who were shocked to find out their computers had been infected. File picture: The FBI have arrested six members of a cyber criminal ring who netted $14million through a sophisticated online advertising scam . They passed on the information to the FBI who began a two-year investigation - Operation Ghostclick - involving police from around the world to track down the fraudsters. Yesterday the FBI, working alongside . international partners, arrested six Estonians within their home . country. A seventh member of the gang, a Russian, is believe to be still . at large. Janice Fedarcyk, FBI Assistant Director in charge of the FBI's New York field office said: 'Today, with the flip of a switch, the FBI and our partners dismantled the Rove criminal enterprise. 'Thanks to the collective effort across the U.S. and in Estonia, six leaders of the criminal enterprise have been arrested and numerous servers operated by the criminal organization have been disabled.' The scam was simple but effective; the crooks would first sign deals with perfectly legitimate online advertising companies which gave them a small fee for sending a web user to certain websites and adverts via links. From 2007 they began spreading the virus . or 'malware'. In the U.S. alone 500,000 computers were infected . including those belonging to businesses and government agencies as well . as private individuals. In most cases the malware, which was designed to resist anti-virus security software, sat unnoticed on the user's hard drive. Known as a DNSchanger it would be activate when the user went online working in two ways. Users . who searched for major websites such as iTunes or Netflix or IRS would . receive a seemingly normal list of links but would be redirected to . pages featuring adverts which the crooks would profit from. Operation Ghostclick: The arrests follow a two-year joint investigation involving the FBI, Nasa and several international security agencies . The powerful virus was also capable of replacing the adverts on major websites such as Amazon.com with one of their own making. The US will now seek to extradite the six criminals who have been taken into custody.

"By . Liz Hull . Last updated at 1:46 AM on 12th November 2011 . This is the youth allegedly filmed on  CCTV swinging a cat around by its tail. Riain Richards, 20, yesterday handed himself in to the authorities. He walked into a police station with his solicitor after being identified as the prime suspect by animal cruelty officers from the RSPCA. 'Trouble-maker': Riain Richards, seen here in a social networking image, has been named as the man who handed himself in to police in connection with swinging Mowgli the cat by its tail . The charity was inundated with calls naming Richards as the alleged culprit after sickening images of a two-year-old tom, named Mowgli, being spun around emerged earlier this week. Yesterday Richards was interviewed by an RSPCA inspector, before being freed. They will decide over the coming weeks whether to prosecute the youth under animal cruelty legislation. Richards, who lives with his building surveyor father, Andrew, 60, in a three-bedroomed detached property in Ramsgate, Kent, refused to comment when confronted by reporters last night. Safe and well: Michelle Buchanan holds her cat Mowgli, who is recovering at home in Ramsgate following the ordeal . However, neighbours claimed he was a tearaway who had gone off the rails following the death of his mother, Dawn, last year. Cruel: Richards is accused of swinging Mowgli around by his tail at least 14 times during the early morning attack last month . One said: ‘Riain is a trouble-maker. He has damaged cars, has young girls to the house and is always playing loud music. One night people came and smashed all the windows in his house. ‘His mother died last year after falling down the stairs. His father is a nice man, but he can’t control Riain. He is away working from  Sunday to Friday. We hope this will mean he will finally leave the street.’ Photographs of jobless Richards on the social networking site Bebo show him drinking and apparently smoking cannabis joints with his friends, who he describes as ‘potheads’. Last night it also emerged that Richards’s half-brother, Ross  Hammond, 31, is serving a life  sentence after being convicted in April 2003 of sexually abusing and murdering a baby. Jade Hart – the 13-month-old daughter of Hammond’s then girlfriend – died of a brain haemorrhage. Hammond had inflicted 117 separate injuries on her, leaving her with a broken leg, fractured ribs and a black eye. Richards is accused of swinging Mowgli around by his tail at least 14 times during the early morning attack last month. The 17-second clip, taken from CCTV cameras installed outside a nearby pub, shows the thug dancing down the street as he is egged on by three friends, the cat’s head coming perilously close to being smashed into cars and railings. His owner, Michelle Buchanan, 43, who was away from her flat at the time, said a neighbour who ran out and confronted the yob undoubtedly saved Mowgli’s life. Shocking: This CCTV footage released by the RSPCA shows a man swinging the cat by its tail outside a pub in Ramsgate, Kent . Near miss: During the attack the cat's head nearly smashed against the pavement. The animal, named Mowgli, was left in a 'very distressed state' Confrontation: Two passers-by appear to speak to the man but he continues to carry out the attack on the helpless cat . Distressing: The cat narrowly avoided a wooden post surrounding a green. The owner of the cat, who lives in a flat below the pub, is said to be too upset to watch the footage . Miss Buchanan, a community education . co-ordinator, said she was ‘delighted’ by the news of Richards’s arrest. ‘What I wanted to happen has happened,’ she said. ‘I have received such . amazing support. It’s incredible what people power can do.’ Hundreds had taken to social networking sites Twitter and Facebook to urge those who knew the culprit to shop him to police. On Thursday officers from Kent police went to arrest Richards, but he was not at his home, near where the incident happened. Yesterday a former school friend of . Richards – who attended Charles Dickens Secondary School, in . Broadstairs, Kent – said everyone realised it was him when they saw the . footage. The friend described his actions as ‘absolutely unacceptable’. Richards voluntarily attended Margate police station shortly before 9am yesterday .","RSPCA inundated with calls from shocked animal lovers naming suspect .

A senior immigration officer is facing a lengthy jail term after he admitted illegally issuing 'scores' of visas to immigrants, granting them indefinite leave to remain in the UK. Samuel Shoyeju, 53, abused his position as an entry clearance officer for the UK Border Agency by allowing African nationals to avoid the normal application process. The visas enabled those who received them – mainly Nigerians – to live and work in Britain. A Crown Prosecution Service source . said: 'We think most of the people who received the visas will never be . traced. They've slipped through the net for good.' A court heard yesterday there was . evidence Shoyeju had received tens of thousands of pounds in cash . payments in his bank accounts. But it is understood it would be . difficult to prove where the money came from and six charges, including . money laundering offences, were dropped against the married . father-of-three, who lives in Canvey Island, Essex. Shoyeju admitted a charge of wilful . misconduct by granting indefinite leave to remain to non-EU nationals . who did not qualify under immigration laws. The offence, which carries a maximum . jail term of ten years, related to 'scores' of visas handed out before . April 30, 2008, Basildon Crown Court heard. Shoyeju, who worked at the agency's . headquarters in Croydon, South London, was remanded in custody and is . not expected to be sentenced until the conclusion of a trial of a . co-defendant. Judge Christopher Mitchell said: 'He's facing a substantial period in custody.' 'The UK Border Agency expects the . highest levels of integrity, behaviour and professionalism from its . workforce and we take any allegations of abuse very seriously,' a . spokesman said. 'If someone is believed to have committed a crime, they . will be prosecuted.' Visa scam: Samuel Shoyeju, 53, admitted misconduct in public office at Basildon Crown Court (pictured) Prosecutor Lucy Kennedy said there was . documentary evidence of vast sums of money being paid into Shoyeju's . account. 'There is an inference to be drawn in that Mr Shoyeju did . receive funds,' she added. 'The fact is we do not know why he was . doing it. For the purposes of sentencing the Crown says the most . critical point is the vast breach of trust.' But Stephen Linehan QC, defending, . said: 'My case has always been that he did not do this for money – there . is absolutely no doubt about it. 'The defendant's case is “I did put . that money in my account. It was not criminal property”.' Few details were given about the case during the brief hearing. The case comes as the UK Border Agency . is already engulfed in separate controversy over claims it went beyond . the terms of a pilot scheme to relax border checks. Immigration officers were informed . secretly to relax checks on biometric chips on the passports of . thousands of people from outside the European Union, it is claimed. Staff were also told not to check . fingerprints and other personal details against a database containing . the names of terror suspects and immigrants who posed a risk to the . public.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 8:54 PM on 11th November 2011 . A small-time drug dealer was tortured, killed and his body dismembered into six pieces 'behind closed doors' by a brutal drug gang, a court heard yesterday. Adam Vincent, 33, was shot with air rifle pellets and savagely punched and kicked in the weeks before his gruesome death. The gang then scattered his body parts in waterways across Lincolnshire, Sheffield Crown Court was told. Discovery: Adam Vincent's head, right arm and right leg were found in the River Ancholme, near Brigg in June, pictured . His severed leg was found sticking out of the water by birdwatchers at Tetney Lock near Cleethorpes on March 3 this year. After a police investigation two other parts were recovered and his head, right arm and right leg were found in the River Ancholme, near Brigg in June. Prosecutor Tom Bayliss QC said the five-strong gang believed Mr Vincent had stolen £5,000 from them and 'grassed' them up to the police. The court heard Mr Vincent was a heroin addict and sold 'wraps' for the gang in return for using some of the drug himself. At the time of his death he was living with the gang whose headquarters was based in a small bungalow in Scartho, Grimsby. Grimsby men Lee Griffiths, 43, his sons Thomas, 22, and Luke, 19, Lee's stepson Mark Jackson, 27, and Matthew Frow, 32, all deny murder between February 26 and March 4. They also deny conspiracy to pervert the course of justice by concealing Mr Vincent's dismembered body between the same dates along with Andrew Lusher, 43, also from Grimsby, who is alleged to have hired the van used to dispose of the body. Mr Vincent's severed leg was found sticking out of the water by birdwatchers at Tetney Lock near Cleethorpes, pictured, on March 3 this year . The three Griffiths and Mark Jackson further deny conspiracy to supply heroin between December 1, 2010 to March 7, 2011. Frow admits conspiracy to supply the Class A drug. Mr Bayliss said Mr Vincent was a close associate of the five men charged with murder. He did small-time drug dealing on their behalf and 'it was the gang he was associated with that killed him.' Three weeks before Mr Vincent's body was found three of the gang were arrested for drugs offences by police then released. Officers searched the bungalow, which is owned by Lee Griffiths, and where Mr Vincent had been living. Mr Bayliss said Lee Griffiths believed Mr Vincent had given information to the police and had stolen £5,000 and drugs from them. The gang began a 'sustained physical assault' on Mr Vincent and the violence continued for a fortnight ultimately leading to his death. A post mortem showed Mr Vincent died from a blunt force trauma to the head. He had been struck at least three times with a weapon. Mr Vincent was last seen alive on February 27 and the following day it is claimed that one of the gang sent a text to his girlfriend which implied Adam Vincent had been killed. His body was dismembered after his death and a van, organised by Lusher, was allegedly used to dispose of it. The birdwatchers chanced on the leg just hours after it had been dumped. Prosecutor Tom Bayliss QC told Sheffield Crown Court, pictured, the five-strong gang believed Mr Vincent had stolen £5,000 from them and 'grassed' them up to the police . Mr Bayliss said: 'Adam Vincent was killed behind closed doors by this gang. 'All five of the defendants were participating in a joint enterprise which led to Adam Vincent's death.' He said it was difficult to identify individual acts of violence but the prosecution claim anyone involved in it is guilty of murder even if they were not present when the fatal blow was delivered. The court heard three of the gang were arrested for suspected drugs offences and the bungalow was searched. Drug paraphernalia was seized along with an air rifle on February 11. Pellets matched to the rifle were found in Mr Vincent's body. Mr Bayliss said: 'Even before this one of the things that was happening was that Mr Vincent had been shot in the body by this a air rifle. 'It would have caused pain and injury. It was an indication of how he was being treated. 'Mr Vincent's father Keith visited his son who was in hospital with pneumonia in late January. Mr Vincent told his dad he had had enough of his drug-taking lifestyle.' 'He said: ''I want to get away but they won't let me. I need to sort some issues out first.' 'He later added: 'You don't know these people. I'm trying to get it all sorted.'' Mr Vincent discharged himself against medical advice and was probably killed three weeks later. Mr Bayliss said witnesses spoke of how Mr Vincent would tell of being beaten up and how 'they couldn't let him go because he knew too much.' When Mr Vincent stole the money from the gang he was given 'a bit of a kicking' and was tied up in the house, it was alleged. Another witness said Lee Griffiths was becoming 'paranoid' about heroin going missing from the house and suspected Mr Vincent had been stealing it. The court heard that as early as January Mr Vincent was seen with a black eye and Thomas Griffiths was bragging he had shot him. A few days before Mr Vincent was killed Thomas Griffiths was seen to punch him in the face in the house and Luke Griffiths kicked him in the side while his father held a knife to Mr Vincent's throat. The victim was later seen in pain and by February 26 was described as having a 'shocking' appearance by a witness at a supermarket. He was walking with a limp and had cuts all over his face. 'His facial expression according to a security guard was one of terror,' said Mr Bayliss. The hearing, which is expected to last at least six weeks, continues.","Adam Vincent was 'shot with air rifle pellets and punched and kicked in the weeks before his death'

They say Met Police at the wedding of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge operated an unlawful policy of pre-emptively stopping, searching and arresting those they believed were likely to express 'anti-monarchist' views. Judges at London's High Court have given the go-ahead for a full judicial review hearing, which is expected to take place in the new year. Unrest: Police, seen her controlling crowds outside Buckingham Palace, have been accused of unlawfully stopping and searching 20 people . Lord Justice Elias, sitting with Mr Justice King, said: 'We have reached the conclusion that there is a sufficient basis for concluding that permission should be granted.' Police lawyers have responded to the claims by saying there is no evidence of an unlawful policy, and policing activities on the wedding day were aimed at preventing criminal conduct, not preventing lawful protest. The Met has pointed out that several anti-royal protests took place in central London which were peaceful and the police did not intervene. Security around high profile royal wedding locations such as the Mall in central London was tight and extensive on April 29 this year . All 20 individuals were arrested in London on April 29, the day Prince William married Kate Middleton, or were subjected to searches on days leading up to the wedding. Two of the applicants, Theodora Middleton and Dafydd Lewis, had their possessions searched when police officers raided their homes at Sipson Camp, a squatters' site in West Drayton, Uxbridge, west London. The camp was initially set up to oppose the building of a new runway at Heathrow Airport but later turned into a community garden and climate change campaign centre. Met Police, seen here controlling crowds along the Mall during the royal wedding, performed one of their most extensive policing operations during the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge . Lawyers for Ms Middleton and Mr Lewis argue that the searches constituted an 'unlawful interference' with their right to respect for their homes and private life under human rights legislation. They are also challenging the legality of a decision by Bromley magistrates to grant the police a search warrant. Hannah Pearce and Shirin Golsirat are seeking judicial review of 'unlawful' searches and seizures of property when other squats were raided across London. Their lawyers argue that the police acted 'outside the scope' of their search warrants. Brian Hicks and 14 other applicants . are challenging a series of 'pre-emptive arrests' made by Met officers . at various locations in central London on the wedding day. They . include individuals in fancy dress who attended a 'zombie picnic', or . alternative royal wedding, organised at Soho Square by Queer Resistance. Lawyers . for Mr Hicks say the arrests were unjustified as the police had no . reasonable grounds for suspecting a breach of the peace. The youngest claimant is 16-year-old M, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Special occasion: Police have pointed out that several anti-monarchist protests took place during William and Kate's wedding, which were peaceful and required no further action . All 20 of the complainants were arrested on April 29, the day of William and Kate's wedding, or subjected to searches in the days leading up to the wedding . He was seen to be carrying a megaphone and stopped and searched on his way to Soho Square. He was handcuffed and arrested on suspicion of possessing items - felt-tip pens - with intent to commit criminal damage. His lawyers argue that his stop and search and subsequent arrest were unlawful and for the ulterior purpose of 'suppressing lawful anti-monarchist protest on the day of the wedding'. The judges indicated that the case should go ahead as a formal judicial review application, unless parties made requests to cross-examine witnesses, in which case an alternative court process might have to be followed.","Those arrested argue police acted 'outside the scope' of search warrants .

"Legendary head coach Joe Paterno fired after his assistant coach Jerry Sandusky was charged with 40 counts of sexual assault . Sandusky's house attacked as passer-by throws cinderblock . President Obama calls for national 'soul searching' in wake of allegations . Penn State, ranked 12th nationally, lost to Nebraska, ranked 19th, 17 points to 14 . By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 10:11 PM on 12th November 2011 . Penn State fans stood together today in support of the university's football team after a week full of sex abuse allegations and the surprising firing of head coach Joe Paterno. The stadium was packed with 100,000 attendees, though the mood was not as lively as normal. The beleaguered team went on to lose against Nebraska, 17 to 14, even though they were ranked higher. While they typically dress in all white, the crowd was dressed in blue as a sign of support for the victims of sexual assault by the team's former defensive line coordinator Jerry Sandusky. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Solidarity: Players walked out onto the filed arm in arm, an unusual move for the typically raucous team . The end: The team walks off the field at the packed Beaver Stadium, capping the scandal-filled week with a loss . Nothing to cheer about: The team lost against Nebraska in their final home game of the season . Advocates for victims of sexual assualt called for a 'blue-out' at today's game, urging attendees to change their wardrobe from the typical 'white out' seen at home games. Donations for two child-abuse prevention organizations were accepted at the stadium gates. Earlier fund-raisers raised more than $200,000 in the days leading up to the game. 'This has been one of the saddest weeks . in the history of Penn State and my heart goes out to those who have . been victimized. I share your anger and sorrow,' new school president . Rod Erickson said in a video played in the first quarter. 'Although we . can't go back to business as usual, our university must move forward. We . are a community.' Saturday home games are a town-wide event in State College, Pennsylvania, and are normally the source of joy and excitement. That feeling was not present at today's game, as the sacking of Paterno left fans with heavy hearts. 'I love Penn State football, always will love Penn State football. Tough week, cried in my office a couple times when I had moments to myself,' said Dave Young, a longtime Penn State fan. 'But now it's time to release and watch the football game and enjoy it,' Mr Young continued. Paterno is one of the most successful coaches in the history of college football, and has been lead Penn State's team for the past 46 years. Showing support: Fans dress up like Joe Paterno and wear sweaters dedicated to him at Saturday's game . Angry: Many fans were upset at the sacking of the famed coach after he failed to properly handle the allegations of sex-abuse . Paterno poseurs: Students dressed up like the fallen coach wearing the glasses he is identified with . He was fired Wednesday after reports surfaced that one of his former assistant coaches, Jerry Sandusky, had assaulted a number of young men while working on the team. Paterno reported the abuse to university higher-ups, but did not contact police, which is the crux of the university's decision against him. Paterno initially said that he would retire at the end of the season, but university trustees then decided that he needed to be fired immediately. Intense: Their actions reflected the heavy weight of tension surrounding Saturday's game . In the glare: Interim coach Tom Bradley took over after Joe Paterno was fired Wednesday . Arriving under pressure: The team walks into the stadium as fans turnout to support amid the sex scandal . New coach: Tom Bradley was appointed interim head coach after Joe Paterno was fired . The move angered fans and students as the coach is seen as a legend. 'Having [Paterno] taken away from us made us feel lost,' said student Leah Blasko. The team was lead by Tom Bradley on Saturday who had served as Paterno's assistant for the past 11 years. 'We are obviously in a very unprecedented situation,' Bradley said Thursday. 'I just have to find a way to restore the confidence and to start a healing process with everybody.' Security: Police are on high alert at Beaver Stadium after an earlier bomb threat . Threat: The school sent out an emergency text to students Saturday morning confirming that there had been a bomb threat against the football stadium . Assistant coach Mike McQueary was put on administrative leave Friday after he had several threats made against him since speaking to a grand jury panel about Jerry Sandusky's activities with young boys. The university president and two administrators were fired and the administrators were arrested in for perjury. An unidentified caller tipped police off to a bomb threat against the famed Beaver Stadium Friday evening, but two sweeps by police and FBI forces were done and nothing was found, allowing Saturday's game against the Nebraska Cornhuskers to go on as scheduled. True colors: Fans typically wear white at games, calling it a 'white out' but more blue was seen Saturday in support for the victims of sexual assault at the hands of one of the team's former coaches . Remembering: Fans of all ages paid tribute to the long career of the recently-fired coach . Missing: Saturday's game was the first in 46 years that Joe Paterno was not a part of . Pre-game events reflected the determined yet repentant mood of the university, with the entire stadium pausing for a moment of silence before the alma mater was sang. When the team members- none of whom were actually involved in the scandal- the players were linked arm-in-arm, showing their level of commitment to the victims. Normally, they rush the field and wave on fans who are screaming in anticipation. 'It's heartbreaking and sad and almost surreal. You can't get it out of your head for more than a minute. I'm sure just about everyone here feels the same way,' said fan Emmie Fay. 'But we're here because we love the school and believe in it,' Ms Fay continued. Legends: Coach Joe Paterno will not be leading the Penn State football team Saturday for the first time in 45 seasons . Fall: Paterno was fired by a school trustee due to his involvement in the Jerry Sandusky sex abuse scandal . A number of former players attended the game and watched on from the sidelines, rallying behind the team, but the most talked about presence was one that was lacking: Joe Paterno was nowhere to be seen. Paterno's son Jay attended the game and cheered on fans, encouraging them to support the team. 'That's Joe Paterno's decision,' new Penn State president Rod Erickson said Friday when asked if he expected Paterno at the game. 'Clearly he's welcome to come, as any other member of the public would be.' Thick of it: Jerry Sandusky (left) is the defensive line coach charged with 40 counts of sexual assault and Mike McQueary (right) was the assistant coach who testified against him . Fatherly: Coach Joe Paterno and his wife Sue addressed fans shortly after his firing was announced Wednesday, and he told students to 'get a good night's sleep, study' The . eight victims of sexual assault by former Penn State defensive line . coach Jerry Sandusky will have to testify if the case goes to trial. Legal experts say that while two of the eight men remain anonymous, they would have to testify in court. That said, there is the thought that the case may not even make it into a courtroom. 'Ninety-four percent of state cases . plead out,' legal commentator Beth Karas told CBS News. 'So, yeah. Chances are it will, but a lot of cases still do go to trial, so it . could.' Sandusky has been charged with 40 . counts relating to sexual assault and many are expecting more victims to . be added as the case continues. 'This was a two-year investigation. There's no reason to believe these eight children are the only ones,' Ms Karas said. 'Jerry Sandusky had his foundation . since 1977. I believe the investigation will widen, and the net cast is . very broad. I did speak with a spokesman for the attorney general's . office, and he will not comment on further victims who are coming . forward. 'Two of the eight are unidentified. They're known as victims two and eight. No one is named in that grand . jury report. But, yes, they will have to testify. That's very common,' Ms Karas continued.

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 1:42 AM on 12th November 2011 . A man with a fetish for cutting off women's hair has been convicted by an Italian court for the 1993 murder of a teenager - months after he received a life sentence in Britain for a similar murder in Bournemouth. Danilo Restivo, who was tried in absentia, was sentenced to 30 years in prison at a court in Salerno near Naples for the death of 16-year-old Elisa Claps. Her decomposed body was found in March last year hidden on the roof of a church in Potenza, Italy, where she was last seen 18 years ago. Jailed: Danilo Restivo, left, who was tried in absentia, was sentenced to 30 years in prison for the death of 16-year-old Elisa Claps, right . In June, Restivo was sentenced in England to life without parole for killing and mutilating his neighbour Heather Barnett, 48, in Bournemouth in 2002. The ritualistic murder - in which the mother-of-two's breasts were cut off and strands of hair placed in her hands - echoed the Claps murder. Restivo, who is serving his sentence in the UK, denied the charges. Elisa's mother, Filomena, appealed to Restivo to 'tell the truth' about her daughter's death following the verdict. Restivo's lawyer, Marnio Marinelli, told reporters that they did not expect a guilty verdict, and refused to comment any further. Discovery: The decomposed body of Elisa was found on the roof of the Santa Trinita Church in Potenza, Italy, pictured, last year . The court will issue its reasoning within 90 days, at which time the defence can appeal. Elisa vanished from her hometown of Potenza, south of Rome on September 12, 1993. Murdered: Heather Barnett who was discovered dead at her house in Bournemouth in November 2002 . She was last seen in the Most Holy Trinity church in downtown Potenza with Restivo, an acquaintance who later acknowledged that he had spent about 10 minutes in the church with her before leaving. Her decomposed remains were discovered in a corner of a hard-to-reach rooftop garret in March 2010 by maintenance workers who had climbed to the roof to fix a leak. Earlier this year Winchester Crown Court heard Restivo bludgeoned Heather Barnett with a hammer before cutting her throat. He then cut off her breasts and left a clump of someone else's hair in her right hand and some of her own underneath her left hand in a ritualistic murder. The Italian then left the body . for Mrs Barnett’s children, Caitlin, then 11, and Terry, then 14, to . find in the bathroom. A victim impact statement . was read on behalf of Caitlin, 19, who described . the ‘horror’ of finding her mother’s body and being told by police that . she was dead. She said: ‘It was at that moment that I felt as if my heart had been ripped out. The house in Bournemouth, Dorset, where Heather Barnett was found murdered in 2002 . Danilo Restivo, 39, being interviewed by police following his arrest for the murder of Heather Barnett . ‘I was in a state of complete and utter shock and it took months before I accepted the truth.' The judge branded Restivo a 'cold, depraved, calculated killer' with a 'sadistic, sexual appetite'. He lived just 50 yards away from . Mrs Barnett and had visited her six days before the murder to ask . about having curtains made. She had told her sister, Denise Le . Voir, she felt ‘concerned, hassled and distressed’ after Restivo stole . her house keys. Restivo falsified alibis on the day . of the murder – first buying a bus ticket during the morning and later . altering log-in records at his place of study. In another bizarre link . between the cases, jurors heard that 15 women had reported their hair . being cut on buses and in a cinema in Bournemouth and also in Potenza . around the time of the murders in 2002 and 1993.","Elisa Claps body found on a church roof in Italy last year .

"By . Nadia Gilani . Last updated at 5:50 PM on 12th November 2011 . Extravagant: Tony Billings led a double life and fleeced people of cash to shower his lover with gifts . A married fantasist stole £430,000 to pay for extravagant gifts and foreign holidays for a woman he was obsessed with. Tony Billings lived an extravagant and a bizarre double life, purporting to be a wealthy businessman to impress the 'love of his life' during their affair, Leicester Crown Court was told. Billings posed as a chartered accountant with a PhD from the London School of Economics and convinced colleagues and friends he was phenomenally successful. The ex-bookkeeper, described as 'singularly average' by his lawyer, smooth-talked his way into a directorship of sports company, Tennis Midlands Ltd, based at Loughborough University. He stole £360,000 from the business, causing it to collapse. He also duped fellow director and Leicestershire tennis professional, David Ireland, out of £70,000 savings, saying he was investing the cash for him. Self-styled 'Dr Billings' always drove new cars and showered his lover - a Derbyshire hairdresser, with treats, including jewellery, cases of champagne and toys for her children. He even gave her £100,000 to pay her divorce settlement and took her to New York and Sri Lanka  - giving her £700-a-month to be his 'research assistant'. However the 52-year-old's excessive lifestyle crashed back to reality when he was sentenced to four years in prison on Thursday. Academic: Billings falsley posed as a chartered accountant with a PhD from the London School of Economics (pictured) His wife, Anne Billings, who signed over the last £28,000 equity on their home before he was made bankrupt, was seated in the public gallery, still supporting him despite his infidelity. Judge . Michael Pert QC said: 'I'm told the reason you stole was to lavish money . on a woman other than your long-suffering wife and this is somehow an . excuse in your mind for what you did. 'You're . a thief. You lived a lie, sitting in an office with plaques and awards . and Financial Times articles on the wall and certificates of academic . excellence - all lies'. Billings, a father of one, from Oakwood, Derby, admitted theft and fraud. John Hallissey, prosecuting, said: 'Over the course of several years Billings lived a double life. 'He . invented a world for himself in which he was a successful, wealthy . economist, a professor, who was able to make substantial sums of money . in the stock market. 'With . extravagant claims and spending he convinced his friends, work . colleagues and even a woman he was in a relationship with of his . financial prowess and success. His whole world was a sham and his entire . lifestyle was financed by theft or fraud. 'In 2007 he trained as a tennis coach at the Nottingham Tennis Centre. It was there he met David Ireland'. Big Apple: Billings took his lover on trips abroad including New York (pictured) Even when arrested, Billings was bizarrely secretly instructing solicitors in the purchase of an £870,000 house. He falsely claimed to have once owned an accountancy business and offered to help with the club's books. He . assisted associates from the club to apply for Lawn Tennis Association . funding to establish a tennis coaching performance programme at the LTA . Academy at Loughborough University. When . the bid was successful he was offered a directorship of the business, . Tennis Midlands Ltd, with responsibility for the finances, because of . his so called expertise. Mr . Hallissey said Billings adorned his office wall with photos of articles . from the Financial Times, with his name superimposed on them. Early in 2010 the cracks began to appear and staff were not paid for three months. He made excuses, blaming cash flow and the death of his father - who was still alive. On . June 21, 2010,  he failed to turn up for work and sent a text message . saying he 'cannot go on any more' to one of the staff saying Tennis . Midlands had ceased trading the previous week. Mr Hallissey said: 'For several years he treated Tennis Midlands' account as though it was his own personal current account. 'Between 2008 and 2010 he stole and spent around £400,000. 'He . was wooing a woman he'd known for some time through tennis clubs. He . would carry ostentatiously large bundles of cash.In June 2010 he was . made bankrupt'. Defence counsel, Philip Bown, said: . 'His deluded behaviour was to maintain an interest of this lady who . clearly was the love of his life. 'He was motivated by desperation to impress her. His lies and dishonesty left misery and destruction in its wake'. When his lover found out about his bankruptcy, he told her: 'If I lose you, I've lost everything'. Mr Brown described him as being mentally fragile, suffering from depression and having low self-esteem. Billings . met his lover in 2004. To maintain her interest he told her he was . suffering from testicular cancer, when it wasn't true. 'He's . a singularly average man, married for many years and was formerly a . bookkeeper. He was besotted by her and lost touch with reality'. Speaking after the sentencing Mr . Ireland, 40, said: 'It's shocking and disgusting that someone you work . with and trust could do such a thing. 'It's one of the harsh lessons in life. 'You . hope not to meet those sorts of people. He was plausible, spent a lot . of time at work, was always the first in the office, and appeared to . have the best interests of the company at heart, which wasn't the case.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 2:01 AM on 12th November 2011 . The teenagers – the youngest of whom was just 13 when the robbery took place – left their shopkeeper victim so terrified that he is no longer able to leave the house alone. They can be named after a judge lifted reporting restrictions due to the seriousness of their offence. A court heard how the gang discussed plans to steal Crunk Juice, an strong alcoholic energy drink, from a newsagent’s. Daniel Flint, aged 15 at the time, sent a text to Joshua Quinn, 14, saying: ‘We are going to rob him for his crunk juice and fags, you on it?’ Baby-faced: Daniel Flint (left), now 16, and Iain Crook (right), now 14 but 13 at the time of the raid, have been handed 18-month custody terms for the robbery . The court was told Joshua Quinn (left), 14, was from a 'very good family', while Jordan Tennant (right), 16, felt a 'deep sense of shame' for what he had done . Bystander: Billy Woodford, now 15, was described as having a tendency to 'lose his way' On June 30 Billy Woodford, 14 at the . time, and Flint entered the News, Food and Wine shop in Southampton, . posing as customers. They were followed by Quinn, Jordan Tennant, 16, . and Iain Crook, then 13, who used hats and scarves to cover their faces. Quinn, who already has one GCSE and . was taking five more a year early, pointed a gun at father- of-two . Gurdeep Singh and demanded cigarettes. Simon Privett, prosecuting, said . Crook, another promising pupil in his school’s top sets, told Mr Singh . to ‘put all the fags in the bag, cash as well’. The gang then left and divided up £140 . in cash, 300 cigarettes and five packets of tobacco. The boys, who did . not have a previous conviction between them, carried out the . unsophisticated raid in 70 seconds. All five were arrested on the same day . and charged with robbery, which they all admitted. Police discovered a . series of text messages between them plotting the raid and, in the days . afterwards, discussing alibis and how to dispose of the weapon, an . antique 1950s air gun found by Quinn’s stepfather years earlier. Mr Singh told officers he thought he . would be shot, while Mr Privett told Southampton Crown Court that he has . suffered from flashbacks and nightmares, and is unable to leave the . house on his own. Judge Patrick Hooton said the crime . was of such seriousness that he had no option other than custody, and . handed down five 18-month sentences. ‘I have heard your mitigation that any . term of custody would be catastrophic for you,’ he said. ‘But the . effect of what you did to Mr Singh is already catastrophic.’ CCTV footage: The masked boys in hooded tops were caught on CCTV during the armed raid on the News, Food and Wine Newsagent's, in Southampton, Hampshire, on June 30 . The raid: One of the gang was just 13 when the shopkeeper was threatened with a gun, held by one of the other boys, aged 14 at the time . American-made Crunk Juce (short for Crazy drunk) is an alcoholic energy drink that is as strong as wine. Police have had growing reports of drinkers on ‘Crunk’ being involved in criminal incidents. Inspector Phil Bates, of Southampton Police, said in June that it is clearly becoming popular since the rise in advertising campaigns for Crunk. Crunk Juice, spelt with an i, is a cocktail consisting of red bull and Hennessy brandy supposedly invented by American rapper Lil Jon. Crunk - short for crazy drunk - is a name given to a type of hip hop music produced by Lil Jon and his group the East Side Boyz. Jon has previously endorsed a non-alcoholic energy drink simply called Crunk. But last year the manufacturers launched Crunk Juce - which is packed with alcohol. The 12 per cent drink is available in three flavours - fruit punch, grape and watermelon. Consuming just one can is the equivalent of drinking a pint of wine mixed with an energy drink such as Red Bull. Crime scene: The five teenagers were jailed for robbing this store - News, Food and Wine Newsagent's, in Southampton, Hamphire on June 30 . Joshua Quinn, 14, - The gunmanUtterly remorseful for his actions according to his barrister who pointed out he had not been one of the planners. Described as coming from “a very good family” He already achieved one GCSE and was taking five more a year early, his barrister claimed prison would have a catastrophic effect on his future.Jordan Tennant, 16, - Masked intruderFelt a deep sense of shame for his part in the robbery, describing it as a “horrible crime” in a letter to the judge.

More than 40 years after jumping bail, a 67-year-old man has surrendered to police to accept his punishment for shooting at officers in a gun battle. On November 5, 1968, Ronald Bridgeforth was involved in a shootout at a San Francisco discount store after he was accused of using a stolen credit card to buy $29 worth of clothes and toys. He has lived under the alias of Cole Lee Jordan over four decade, working his way up from being a janitor to earning a master's degree and becoming a college guidance counselor in Michigan. Fugitive: Ronald Bridgeforth, 67, has surrendered to police to accept punishment for shooting at officers in a gun battle in 1968 . On Thursday, after resigning from his job, Bridgeforth arrived at the Hall of Justice in Redwood City, California, and surrendered. 'This seems to be the right thing to do, and in the end it is all about family.' Bridgeforth said. 'I guess I've come back to face the consequences of my actions on that evning of 1968.' 'He wanted his sons to grow up to be the man he was today, not the young man he was on Nov. 5, 1968,' his attorney Paul Harris told ABCNews.com. After being confronted on that day in . 1968, Bridgeforth allegedly pulled a gun on the officers and fired two . bullets into a police car. Police fired back, shooting him in the foot. No officers were injured in the shoot out and Bridgeforth was taken into custody. On the run: A 23-year-old Ronald Bridgeforth jumped bail after being arrested during a shootout in San Francisco on November 5, 1968 . Accused: Fugitive Ronald Bridgeforth is charged with shooting at police officers outside this store in San Francisco in 1968 . He pleaded no contest to the shooting, but jumped bail in 1969 and escaped to Africa for a year, where he knew no one. 'He was 23 and scared, his lawyer said he'd serve life in prison because California had indeterminate sentencing at that time,'  Mr Harris said. After a year, Bridgeforth returned to the United States and assumed his new identity as Cole Lee Jordan. He settled in to life in Ann Arbor with his wife, Diane, who was the only person to share his secret. Bridgeforth's two grown sons have only recently learned of their father's past. He had even severed ties with his mother to keep his identity secret, reports ABCNews.com. Surrender: Fugitive Ronald Bridgeforth arrives in court to hand himself in for the 1968 shooting . Bridgeforth got a job working as a . janitor at Washtenaw Community College in 1978, according to Janet . Hawkins, spokeswoman for the school. 'Throughout his work here, he went to school and took on various jobs,' Ms Hawkins said. She told ABCNews.com that Bridgeforth earned a bachelors degree in general studies from Wayne State University in 1986 and a masters degree in counseling from Eastern Michigan in 1993. He was licensed as a professional counselor in 1994 and became a faculty member at Washtenaw Community College in 1998, where he worked as a student adviser ever since. Handcuffed: Bridgeforth was put in handcuffs and led away by bailiffs as he whispered, 'I love you,' to his wife . On Thursday, after his attorney said he . would plead guilty on Nov. 22, Bridgeforth was handcuffed and led away . by bailiffs as he whispered, 'I love you,' to his wife . Mr . Harris said he expects to make Bridgeforth's $25,000 bail, thanks to . the level of support that he said has been pouring in 'from all over' Bridgeforth knew when he came forward that he was also wanted for the 1971 fatal shooting of an officer. He was alleged to be the getaway driver, but he denied any involvement. Mr Harris said his client wasn't even in the state at the time of the incident. The San Mateo deputy district attorney said that those charges would be dropped. Wanted: Ronald Bridgeforth was also wanted for having a part in the murder of San Francisco Sgt John Young (pictured), the case against him has since been dropped . Deputy District Attorney Karen Guidotti is asking a judge to sentence Bridgeworth to five years in prison, Harris said, but he's hopeful his client will walk away with probation. Despite giving up his freedom, Mr Harris said Bridgeforth's family is proud of him for setting things right. And after 41 years, he was able to have a long-awaited emotional reunion with his mother, who is now 82-years-old. 'His family is by his side right now,' Mr Harris told ABCNews.com, adding: '[Ronald] is one of the most dignified, good people I have ever worked with.'","Wanted 67-year-old faces up to five years in prison .

Gloria Dwomoh, said to be obsessed with the weight of ten-month-old daughter Diamond, used a small milk jug to tip baby rice, African corn porridge and chicken soup into her mouth. The 31-year-old denied causing or allowing the baby’s death, insisting the method was ‘perfect’ and widely used in her home country, Ghana. Nurse Gloria Dwomoh and her daughter Diamond. She has been jailed for three years at the Old Bailey for force-feeding the ten-month-old . She admitted that Diamond often vomited after being fed, but said it did not worry her because her three other children had done the same. Gloria Dwomoh, appearing outside court at an earlier hearing, was told she should have known better . She had been warned about the dangers of the practice more than two years before Diamond died in 2010 when she developed pneumonia after food got into her lungs. In what was thought to be the first case of its type, Dwomoh, who worked at St Thomas’s Hospital in South London, was unanimously convicted after a three-week trial at the Old Bailey last month. Her 37-year-old husband, who cannot be named, was cleared. The Common Serjeant of London, Judge Brian Barker, said the case was ‘truly rare and truly tragic’. He told her: ‘You come from a background where the attempted feeding from a cup or a jug where a child is held may have been traditional. ‘But by the time of Diamond’s birth you must have known in this country, the feeding of young children in this way against her will was wrong and dangerous. ‘Social services has been involved with the family ... and it appears you paid little attention to what they said.’ He added: ‘You are a trained nurse. You must have known the importance when feeding the recipient, whatever their age, should stay in control of their intake. 'At best, it was a misguided obsession but it was a determined obsession and must have caused prolonged and daily distress to your daughter.’ The public gallery was packed with family and friends, and her barrister Trevor Burke told the court her husband had a petition with 1,000 signatures, saying she was a loving mother. During her trial she told the jury: ‘I knew cup feeding was entirely perfect because I have seen it myself being used in Ghana with my own eyes. I would do nothing to harm her. I was scared.’ Mother-of-three: Gloria Dwomoh, a picture of baby Diamond, and two of her other children - faces obscured to protect their identity .","Court hears she poured liquidised food down throat of 10-month-old toddler .

Kim Kardashian's former publicist claims the reality star has never got over her ex Reggie Bush - and that her marriage to Kris Humphries was a sham. Jonathan Jaxson - who worked with the reality star between 2007 and 2009 - has renewed claims Kim's nuptials to NBA star Humphries were a publicity stunt. Speaking on Good Day LA this morning, Jaxson said: 'Two weeks prior to her wedding she knew it was not something she wanted to do. 'Unfortunately they were obligated to . honour contracts [with the E! network which had TV rights] otherwise they . would have owed a lot of people a lot of money.' Earlier this week during an interview with New York's Elvis . Duran and the Morning Show, Jaxson said: 'She's never gotten over [her ex . Reggie Bush].' Kim, 31, and 26-year-old NFL star Reggie were the subject of repeated engagement claims throughout their relationship. The . couple dated for around two years before initially splitting in July . 2009. Two months later they got back together before ending their . relationship again in March last year. Lovely in leather: Kim was spotted on the set of The Wedding Counsellor in Atlanta today . On location: The 31-year-old reality star will complete her last day of filming today before heading back to LA . Jaxson claimed he would often help Kim stage publicity stunts when he worked with her. He continued: 'I staged several of the moments that . the world has seen of her, such as a ring that we alleged was from . Reggie Bush.' The publicist . talked about how he helped generate a fake engagement story between Kim . and Reggie in 2007 by setting up paparazzi to take pictures of her . leaving a Beverly Hills jewellery store. She . then sported a ring on her wedding finger in public - which Jaxson . claimed is identical to the one Kris proposed to Kim with. Jaxson added that there is no doubt Kim and Kris, 26, made a packet during their time together. Speaking out: Kim's former publicist spoke to Good Day LA this morning . Despite . Kim's mother Kris Jenner insisting her daughter 'didn't make a dime out . of the wedding - responding to reports the couple netted a whopping . $17.9m - Jaxson begs to differ. He told the radio show on Wednesday: 'They had a lot of contracts, they had endorsements. To say they weren't paid is a lot of foolish garbage.' Kim is yet to respond to her former publicist's claims. 'Staged': Kim's former publicist Jonathan Jaxson claims her marriage to Kris Humphries was a publicity stunt . But . she has publicly denied her marriage to Kris - who she filed for . divorce from just 72 days after the Montecito nuptials - was fake. 'Anyone that would get married for a TV show, it's just, you know, . ridiculous,' she said. 'It's just sad that I even have to defend that.' Meanwhile, it has emerged that Humphries is using Minnesota-based lawyer Lee Hutton to end his marriage with Kim. Hutton represents a lot of sports stars, although does not tend to deal with divorces, according to TMZ. Jetting and netting: Her mother Kris Jenner flew back to LA from Atlanta today after visiting her daughter while Kim's ex, NBA star Humphries, was out training in Minnesota yesterday . But as the divorce is quite straight forward,  it should not be an issue. Kim and Kris are not disputing who gets what in the division of assets due to the prenup being put in place. The divorce should be finalised six months from the date Kim filed - the minimum time required by law. Kim is currently in Atlanta shooting for a cameo role in the Tyler Perry movie, The Marriage Counsellor and was spotted on set again today for her last day of filming.

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 2:35 PM on 11th November 2011 . Two former News of the World executives have hit back at their 'disingenuous' former boss James Murdoch as a bitter war of words engulfs the media empire. The paper's former editor Colin Myler and ex-legal manager Tom Crone claim that they made Mr Murdoch aware of widespread hacking within the organisation as long ago as 2008. But Mr Murdoch told MPs yesterday he 'disputed vigorously' the claims from Mr Myler and Mr Crone that they revealed the significance of an email indicating the practice was widespread. The meeting in June 2008 centres on the 'For Neville' email which contained transcripts of hacked messages from the mobile phone of Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association. This email was apparently intended for chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck. Coming out fighting: Former News of the World editor Colin Myler, left, and Tom Crone, former legal manager of News International say James Murdoch was told in 2008 about widespread hacking . Denials: News Corp executive James Murdoch protests his innocence to MPs during a second round of questioning in front of the Commons Culture Committee yesterday . Had Mr Murdoch been fully briefed about the contents of the message it would have been clear to him that hacking was not limited to the single 'rogue' reporter, Clive Goodman, who was jailed in 2007. Mr Myler and Mr Crone say he knew about the contents of the email. Mr Murdoch says he did not. After the meeting, a payment of  £425,000 was made to Mr Taylor in return for a confidentiality agreement that prevents him from discussing the matter. It is not known how such a significant payment could have been made without the full reasons being known by those at the top of the organisations. Parliament was later told in July 2009 that hacking was restricted to a single reporter. Mr Murdoch has repeatedly insisted to MPs that he had no knowledge of hacking. The bitter row erupted yesterday after Mr Murdoch's bruising second appearance before the House of Commons Culture Committee's inquiry into the scandal. The 'For Neville' email and the payment to Gordon Taylor were two of the main lines of questioning that MPs used to interrogate Mr Murdoch. Mr Murdoch insisted he had not learned until recently that the practice of illegally eavesdropping on private phone messages was widely used at the newspaper. The evidence given to the committee by Mr Crone and Mr Myler in September was 'inconsistent and not right', he said, adding: 'I believe their testimony was misleading and I dispute it.' Committee chairman John Whittingdale said it was clear that of the two accounts MPs had heard about the June 2008 meeting to discuss settling a legal claim brought by Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor 'one of them cannot be true'. Mr Murdoch admitted that he was made aware by Mr Crone and Mr Myler at that meeting of the existence of the 'For Neville' email. But he insisted he was not shown it or told its full contents or significance. Mr Watson told the hearing that he had spoken to Mr Thurlbeck, who claimed he was told by Mr Crone that he had shown the email to Mr Murdoch. Mr Crone and Mr Myler had told MPs the email was the sole reason for deciding to pay Mr Taylor an out of court payment of £425,000, because it fatally undermined the 'single rogue reporter' theory. They say the News International boss was fully aware of this, suggesting his denials to MPs were misleading. However, asked by Labour MP Tom Watson whether he had misled the committee in his previous evidence, Mr Murdoch said: 'No, I did not.' Mr Murdoch admitted he was made aware of the existence of the 'for Neville' email but said he was not shown it, nor told of its full contents by Mr Crone or Mr Myler when they discussed settling Mr Taylor's case at the June 10 meeting. Labour MP Tom Watson, left, has called for football boss Gordon Taylor, chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, to come clean  over his £425,000 out-of-court hacking settlement . It was a short meeting, said Mr Murdoch, . where he was given 'sufficient information to authorise the increase of . the settlement offer that had been made. But I was given no more than . that.' He said the email 'was mentioned to me as evidence that was important with respect of it being a transcript of a voicemail interception that came through, that proved it was on behalf of the News of the World'. He added: 'It was not shown to me, nor was it discussed with me its other features – that it was 'For Neville,' and that it might indicate wider-spread knowledge or wider-spread activities of phone-hacking.' The two former executives fought back against Mr Murdoch's suggestions that they had misled Parliament. Mr Myler and Mr Crone both issued statements last night standing by their original evidence to Parliament that their media boss knew the practice went beyond a single 'rogue reporter'. 'For Neville': The controversial email was destined for the paper's former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck . In a statement later, Mr Crone said he 'can perfectly understand' why Mr Murdoch 'felt the need to discredit' the two men but found it 'regrettable'. 'The simple truth is that he was told by us in 2008 about the damning email and what it meant in terms of wider News of the World involvement,' he added. 'At best, his evidence on this matter was disingenuous.' Mr Myler said he had 'every confidence' the police would establish the truth adding: 'My evidence to the Select Committee has been entirely accurate and consistent. I stand by my account of the meeting with James Murdoch on 10 June 2008.' The now-defunct newspaper's chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck said he had compiled his own secret dossier - partly held by the police - that he believed would be 'good news' for the beleaguered Mr Murdoch. But Mr Thurlbeck said last night his dossier would be 'good news' because it would back up Mr Murdoch's claim that he has been 'seriously misled by senior executives on the News of the World'. 'But it will be bad news in the sense it will prove my case for unfair dismissal and will certainly cost News International the redundancy money which they owe me,' he added. Labour MP Chris Bryant said Mr Murdoch’s credibility as chairman of parent company News International had been shattered by his claim that he was kept in the dark and failed to establish what happened. Mr Bryant said Mr Murdoch, the son of News Corporation chief Rupert, should stand down. He said: 'I don’t think anyone really thinks he was telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. His defence was that he is incompetent — because he never bothered to ask the questions that a 12-year-old would have asked. 'If I was a shareholder in BSkyB or News Corporation, I would say, ‘you have allowed your company to corrupt the Metropolitan Police, to lie to Parliament, and to hack the best part of 6,000 people: It’s time you went’.' The Labour MP and shadow justice minister said a director of a construction company would be held personally liable for any injuries and that being ignorant was no excuse. The Times newspaper, part of the Murdoch group, today used a leading article to admit that the company mishandled the crisis by putting private investigators onto its critics. It said: 'This was disgraceful. Instead of listening and responding to those asking legitimate questions, the company instead pursued its critics as enemies.'","Colin Myler and Tom Crone say that James Murdoch was told in 2008 about widespread hacking .

"By . Claire Bates . Last updated at 5:34 PM on 8th November 2011 . A surgeon who uses laser surgery to boost women's sex lives faces being struck off for damaging five patients. Professor Phanuel Dartey - who has pioneered the use of lasers for cosmetic genital surgery - is due to appear before the General Medical Council next week. The 68-year-old who claims he has helped hundreds of women patients over the last three years, has been suspended for 18 months while his case was investigated. Some women resort to vagina rejuvenation after childbirth because loosening of the vaginal canal can affect how much they enjoy sex (posed) He practised at several major private hospitals in London and two years ago hit the headlines with an injection designed to enlarge the G spot. The jab is said to increase the number of orgasms experienced by a woman by making it easier for their partners to hit the target. But professor Dartey's main work was in the controversial area of 'vaginal rejuvenation' using a laser treatment developed in the USA. His operations cost as much as £6,000. Some doctors believe that such surgery should be banned. Many of Dartey's patients were women who wanted their sex lives restored following difficult childbirth while others were concerned about the external appearance of their genitals. Professor Dartey claims that he has been suspended on the basis of one complaint from a patient who had undergone cosmetic surgery on her labia. He said: 'She wasn't happy with the aesthetic result of the operation. That can happen. This type of surgery is very personal and I always offer further surgery without charge if the end result wasn't quite what was wanted.' But the GMC's case is that he harmed a number of patients and also worked without medical insurance. Professor Dartey's case will come before the GMC on 14th November . He is charged with not obtaining consent for labial surgery from one patient, not telling her about risks and complications and leaving her scarred. He is alleged to have operated 'inappropriately' on another lady and with a third failed to manage post surgery complications. Another patient suffered a punctured uterus and fifth was left in pain after 'inappropriate' surgery. Professor Dartey - a gynaecologist and obstetrician -runs the UK Laser Gynaecology Centre from rooms in London's Harley Street. The vagina can often loosen after childbirth which can decrease enjoyment of sex. The cosmetic procedure involves using a laser to tighten the muscles in the vaginal canal. It is a non-invasive procedure that takes one to two hours. It is said to cause less scarring than a scalpel and cautery machine as it can both cut and seal blood vessels. Recovery time is eight weeks on average but women can return to work after a week. It is performed in a number of clinics in the U.S, . but Professor Dartey was the only one to offer it in the UK. His website states: 'The majority of operations performed at the UK LGC are on women post childbirth suffering from vaginal prolapse resulting in urinary stress incontinence. 'Procedures are available to rejuvenate the structures of the vagina to their pre-pregnancy state and for women with no children, aesthetic solutions are available through cosmetic procedures.' Professor Dartey said: 'I was shocked that the GMC decided to suspend me. They have presented no serious evidence that I am a risk to patients. 'The expert witness who they used to criticise my surgery isn't even qualified in laser surgery so can't judge my results.' He claimed: 'I have lots of satisfied women patients since I started using a laser for this type of surgery.  I have carried out more than 250 operations using the laser and there have been no complaints. 'Quite a lot of patients have surgery because childbirth has affected their sex lives or even caused medical problems like urinary incontinence. 'I have had lots of compliments from patients who have said my surgery has transformed their lives. 'I have practised in this country for 40 years and have never had any complaints by patients to the GMC.' A leading private dentist - who had 'vaginal rejuvenation' carried out by Dartey claimed the surgeon had done a 'fantastic job' for her and been 'very caring and attentive'. She said: 'I have birth to four strapping kids and as a result things below got out of shape. 'It affected my sex life and gave me urinary incontinence. Professor Dartey used his laser technique and he transformed my life. I can't speak to highly of him. 'I was so happy with the result that I would speak to other women who were considering the surgery. I was shocked to hear that Professor Dartey had been suspended and I've written to the GMC supporting him.' One of his anaesthetists from the world-famous Royal Marsden Hospital wrote a testimonial to the GMC describing Dartey's work surgical work as ""painstaking"" and ""caring"" and that he was particularly concerned about the safe use of the laser. Despite practising in Harley Street and at some of London's top private hospitals, three time married Professor Dartey, lives alone in a modest two up two down terraced house in Edmonton, North London and drives a 20 year-old Daimler Sovereign. He claimed: 'I don't make a lot of money by the time I've paid for the operating theatre and an anaesthetist. I also 'redo' some operations if patients aren't totally happy. 'I'm not in private practice to make a fortune. I take lot of time with my patients. This is intimate surgery and give patients a lot of my time to make sure they are happy. 'And I generally don't charge for this. I want patients to be happy with surgery and I won't charge if they think the final result is not quite right.' Just days before his suspension in March last year he was giving a lecture on laser surgery at the Royal Society of Medicine. Ghanian-born Dartey - who gained his medical degree in Russia - trained up to consultant level in the NHS before going into private practice in the 1980s.  At one stage he ran a fertility clinic in Wanstead, East London which went bust. A leading consultant gynaecologist who specialises in the same sort of surgery, but without laser, said: 'This is a difficult area of surgery, particularly when you operate on external genitalia. The end result is very personal. 'Professor Dartey has an additional problem because he is the only surgeon in this country using the laser for this type of work.'","GMC's case is that Professor Dartey harmed a number of patients and worked without medical insurance .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 4:37 PM on 13th November 2011 . Searching for help, President Barack . Obama lobbied the skeptical leaders of Russia and China on Saturday for . support in keeping Iran from becoming a nuclear-armed menace to the . world, hoping to yield a 'common response' to a crisis that is testing . international unity. Yet Obama's talk of solidarity with . Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Chinese President Hu Jintao was . not publicly echoed by either man as Iran moved anew to the fore of the . international stage -- and to the front of the fierce U.S. presidential . race. Obama, at home in Hawaii and holding . forth on a world stage, also sought to show aggressiveness in fixing an . economy that has weakened his standing with voters. Agreement: Speaking to reporters Saturday, President Obama (right) said he and Russian President Medvedev (left) plan to 'shape a common response' to possible Iranian nuclear weapons . He pushed Hu about American impatience . with China's economic policy, touted the makings of a new pacific trade . zone and showered attention on the lucrative Asia-Pacific export . market. The United States' vast worries about . Iran grew starker with a report this week by the U.N. atomic agency that . asserted in the strongest terms yet Iran is conducting secret work with . the sole intent of developing nuclear arms. The U.S. claims a nuclear-armed Iran could set off an arms race among rival states and directly threaten Israel. Last month Israel informed Obama of no guarantees a strike against Iran would be notified in advance to the U.S., suggesting the country feels it no longer needs Washington's permission, a source briefed on the meeting told the Telegraph. 'They did not suggest that military action was being planned or was imminent, . but neither did they give any assurances that Israel would first seek . Washington's permission, or even inform the White House in advance that a . mission was underway,' a source told the Telegraph. The Israeli decision shows a dampening confidence in a diplomatic solution by the state, as Russia and China remain a roadblock to the United States in its push to tighten international sanctions on Iran. Pressed efforts: Despite President Obama's push (right) for Russian President Medvedev (left) to tighten control of Iran, both Russia and China has shown no sign of interest . Both are veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council and have shown no sign the new report will change their stand. With Medvedev on the sidelines of an . Asia-Pacific summit here, Obama said the two 'reaffirmed our intention . to work to shape a common response' on Iran. Shortly after, Obama joined Hu, in a . run of back-to-back diplomacy with the heads of two allies that hold . complicated and at times divisive relations with the United States. Obama said that he and the Chinese leader want to ensure that Iran . abides by 'international rules and norms.' Obama's comments were broad enough to portray a united front without yielding any clear indication of progress. Medvedev, for his part, was largely . silent on Iran during his remarks, merely acknowledging that the subject . was discussed. Hu did not mention Iran at all. Iranian operations: A nuclear power plant in Iran is eyed in a report released Friday by the International Atomic Energy Agency that raises concern about Iran's nuclear program . Fabrication: Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei (center) claims a report released Friday on their nuclear program is fabricated but international concerns grow as the country warns nearby Israel of mass retaliation to any military attacks . White House aides insisted later that . Russia and China remain unified with the United States and other allies . in preventing Iran from developing nuclear weapons, and that Obama, Hu . and Medvedev had agreed to work on the next steps. Deputy national security adviser Ben . Rhodes said the new allegations about Iran's programs demand an . international response, and 'I think the Russians and the Chinese . understand that. We're going to be working with them to formulate that . response.' As the president held forth on the . world stage in his home state, Republicans vying to compete against . Obama for the presidency unleashed withering criticism in a 'Commander-in-Chief Debate' held in . South Carolina. On the defense: Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (center) addressed the IAEA report in a cabinet meeting saying it strengthens claims that Iran is developing nuclear weapons . It was a rare moment in which foreign policy garnered attention in a campaign dominated by the flagging U.S. economy. 'If we re-elect Barack Obama, Iran . will have a nuclear weapon. And if you elect Mitt Romney, Iran will not . have a nuclear weapon,' said Mitt Romney, the former Massachusetts governor. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann warned . that Iran's attempt to develop a nuclear weapon is setting the table . 'for worldwide nuclear war against Israel.' In competing plans by the presidential candidates, Rival Herman Cain says he would not use military action but . says he would move warships to the region to deter Iran. Instead, Mr Cain says he . would prefer to aid the resistance to Tehran to overthrow the regime. Candidates' debate: The 'Commander-in-Chief Debate' Saturday was the first foreign policy debate by the U.S. GOP candidates . Iraq: Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul likened the U.S.' handling of Iran to 'the war propaganda that went on against Iraq.' And rival Ron Paul, a congressman from Texas, says any use . of force against Iran would require approval from Congress, adding, . 'I'm afraid what's going on right now is similar to the war propaganda that . went on against Iraq.' Iran has insisted its nuclear work is in the peaceful pursuit of energy and research, not weaponry. U.S. officials have said the report by . the International Atomic Energy Agency was unlikely to persuade China . and Russia to support tougher sanctions on the Iranian government. But led by Obama, the administration . is still trying to mount pressure on Iran, both through the United . Nations and its own, for fear of what may come should Iran proceed . undeterred. Financial pressure: Texas Governor Rick Perry suggested a form of pressure to foreign countries would be scrapping their foreign aid to zero dollars and negotiating up from there . In a suggested form of pressure by Mr Perry at Saturday's debate, he proposed a cut to foreign aid to send 'a clear message to every country.' '...the foreign aid budget in my administration for every country is gonna start at zero dollars. Zero dollars. And then we'll have a conversation,' Mr Perry said. More broadly, Obama sought Saturday to . position the United States as a Pacific power, creating more . American jobs by tapping the explosive potential of the Asia-Pacific. For businesses, he said, 'this is where the action's going to be.' 'There is no region in the world that . we consider more vital than the Asia-Pacific region,' he told chief . executives gathered for a regional economic summit. The president went so far as to saying . the United States had grown 'a little bit lazy' in trying to attract . business to the United States. Obama's aides said he was blunt with . Hu in expressing concern about China's undervalued currency, which keeps . its exports cheaper and U.S. exports to China more expensive. Deputy National Security Adviser Mike . Froman said Obama made it clear that Americans are growing 'increasingly . impatient and frustrated' with the state of change in China economic . policy. Economy: President Obama and wife Michelle greet Chinese President Hu Jintao and his wife Liu Yongqing (left) ahead of the APEC summit leaders' dinner before discussing the U.S' desire for the Chinese currency to be permitted to rise . China had a $273 billion trade surplus . with the U.S. last year and U.S. lawmakers say the imbalance hurts . American manufacturers and taken away American jobs. Underscoring the search for some good . economic news ahead heading toward a re-election vote, Obama announced . the broad outlines of an agreement to create a transpacific trade zone . encompassing the United States and eight other nations. He said details must still be worked out, but said the goal was to complete the deal by next year. 'The United States is a Pacific power and we're here to stay,' Obama said. The eight countries joining the U.S. in the zone would be Australia, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, New Zealand, . Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Obama also spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda about Japan's interest in joining the trade bloc. Free trade: Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda (left) told President Obama Saturday of Tokyo's desire to negotiate a Pacific free trade area with the U.S. In a sign of potential tension with . China, Froman shrugged off complaints from China that it had not been . invited to join the trade bloc. He told reporters that China had not . expressed interest in joining and said the trade group 'is not something . that one gets invited to. It's something that one aspires to.' Addressing the European debt crisis, . Obama said he welcomed the new governments being formed in Greece and . Italy, saying they should help calm world financial markets. Obama's ever increasing attention to . the Asia-Pacific is driven in part by Europe's own financial woes and . the U.S. need to get more aggressive in tapping its export options. Obama will be in Honolulu through Tuesday, when he leaves for Australia before ending his trip in Indonesia.","U.S. Presidential candidates liken President Obama's handling of Iran to Iraq .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:12 PM on 11th November 2011 . 'Light touch': Theresa May has secretly abolished passport checks for foreigners entering the UK on certain flights . A second relaxation of border controls authorised by Theresa May has allowed thousands to enter Britain without passport checks, it emerged today. The 'smart zone' system was quietly introduced at Luton, Gatwick, Birmingham and Leeds/Bradford  airports last year. It means some passengers are security-screened before take-off and face only a 'light touch' inspection on their arrival. The minimal checks have resulted in those on 'low risk' routes into the UK passing through border control in half the time previously taken. The system makes it easier for illegal immigrants, criminals and terrorists to enter the country unchallenged. The new rules were revealed by the Daily Telegraph with the Home Secretary already under fire for a separate, secret move in the summer to relax passport checks at all airports. 'Smart zone allows us to pre-check people on low-risk routes and, . therefore, to provide a faster, lighter-touch, screening of passengers . at the port,' said the UK Border Agency, in a report seen by the newspaper. 'This is better for passengers and allows . us to use our staff’s expertise at spotting the unknown risk, rather . than routinely processing documents.' The report shows the Home Office are putting an end to the processing of passports and other travel documents for selected . flights, the newspaper said. Low security: The 'smart zone' system means passengers are only screened before take-off, making it far easier for terrorists and illegal immigrants to slip through the net . Insiders claim the tactics could pave the way for full-blown profiling of travellers based on race, according to the Telegraph. Further trials of the system are planned for Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester airports, and some coach parties arriving from Calais have been ushered in under the relaxed new policy. The French coastal city is a notorious entry route used by people-trafficking networks, who have been known to charge migrants up to £5,000 to smuggle them into Britain. Mrs May faced three days of grilling this week over her involvement in disgraced ex-border chief Brodie Clark's reckless relaxation of passport checks. The Home Secretary admitted she authorised a pilot scheme relaxing checks on EU nationals, but insisted Mr Clark had gone much further without her knowledge. Fighting back: Border chief Brodie Clark is suing the Home Secretary for constructive dismissal, as he claims she knew all about his relaxations of security controls . Mr Clark, who is bringing a six-figure lawsuit against Mrs May for constructive dismissal, argued that Mrs May was aware of all his actions. Over the summer, he allegedly allowed the . suspension of checks on non-EU nationals, and let staff stop checking . against a warning index of terror suspects and illegal immigrants. During tense exchanges in the Commons on Wednesday, Mrs May admitted that an internal Border Agency document leaked on Monday did ‘reflect government policy’. It showed that staff were told to ‘cease routinely opening the chip’ within biometric passports from EU nations. She also agreed to suspend so-called warning index checks for children travelling with an EU passport with their family or on a school trip, sparking fears that a trafficked child could slip through the net. Mr Clark will give evidence to MPs next week which could cause further trouble for Mrs May following calls for her resignation this week. Labour MP Simon Danczuk yesterday asked Sir Gus O’Donnell, the head . of the Civil Service, to investigate the conduct of Mrs May’s aides in . relation to Mr Clark. Damian Green, the immigration minister, said in parliament that UKBA was reviewing its processes. He said: 'Smart zones are one part of this and operate by using information . gathered through the e-Borders system [a programme that collects electronic records of everyone entering and leaving the country] to conduct enhanced watch-list . checks in advance of arrival.' 'Passengers are then directed through a designated smart zone where the . appropriate level of checks can be made on arrival. This has the . potential to remove duplication of detailed checks at the border, improving the passenger experience while maintaining border security.' A Home Office evaluation of the smart zone scheme is due next month. Whitehall officials said feedback from UKBA staff, airlines and . passengers had been positive. UKBA was unable to comment today.","Thousands allowed to enter without proper checks .

"By . Meghan Keneally . Last updated at 7:02 PM on 14th November 2011 . A video interview with Jerry Sandusky in 1987 offers a disturbing look into the earlier mind of the man now charged with 40 counts of sexual assault after sexually abusing at least eight young boys. The former defensive line coach for Penn State University's football team was at the height of his career when he was interviewed by NBC news, talking about the charity he formed to help underprivileged youth. Now, in light of the scandal that broke last Saturday, it is confirmed that he used that same charity as a way to pick his victims. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Behind the smile: Jerry Sandusky was interviewed by NBC in October 1987, ten years after starting his charity . Connected: Sandusky's name was inherently connected to Penn State and his coaching role made him a local hero . 'I enjoy being around children,' he said, smiling. 'I enjoy their enthusiasm. I just have a good time with them.' Sandusky created The Second Mile as a charity to help underprivileged Pennsylvania youth, often in need of foster homes. The court report filed against Sandusky says the self-described mission of the charity was to 'help children who need additional support and would benefit from positive human interaction'. Sandusky was very much the head of the program until he retired last year, and was the emotional leader of the organization, respected and admired by the children as a fatherly figure both because of his charity and because of his position in the Penn State football program. 'Spending time': The interview shows Sandusky playing sports and swimming with the children from The Second Mile . Founder: Sandusky created The Second Mile in 1977 and now it is known that is where he chose his victims . 'One of the biggest things would be the trust that would developed,' he said of his goals for the program. 'What we're trying to be is, what we think to be of, is a true friend. 'Everybody needs people to care for them.' He alludes to his role as a disciplinarian as well, which has an underlying message after having read the court reports which describe his sexual interactions with unwilling young boys. 'Sometimes they don't want it, sometimes they don't understand what you're trying to do but they want to be disciplined,' he said. 'Kids are growing up awfully fast today.' Leaders: head coach Joe Paterno (left) was . already a legend in the late eighties and Sandusky was considered his . second-in-command, making him a football celebrity on his own (right) Resigned: Jack Raykovitz, former CEO of The Second Mile, resigned amid allegations that Sandusky found his victims through the organization . The damage of the allegations continues . to spread as the charity announced Sunday that Dr. Jack Raykovitz, who . has served as the CEO of The Second Mile for the past 28 years, . resigned, saying that he and the board of directors felt it was in 'the . best interest' of the organization. This old interview and the removal of Mr Raykovitz from The Second Mile comes just as one of Sandusky's victims hired an attorney to pursue a civil suit against anyone who potentially knew about the abuse and did nothing. The lawyer, Ben Andreozzi, represents . one of the unnamed victims and would not give any clues as to which one, . but said that his client is 'torn up' about the entire situation. 'It's . important to understand that these folks were involved in the Penn . State football community,' Mr Andreozzi said in an interview with the . Today Show. 'They were on . the sidelines of football games, they were spending significant amounts . of time travelling with the team and or in the locker room with the team . and getting to know members of that football team. to say that he's . torn apart would be an emotion would really explain where he's at right . now,' he continued. Lawyered up: Ben Andreozzi is pursuing a civil lawsuit for one of the victims against anyone who knew of the abuse but did not report it to police or law enforcement officials . Because of the victims close ties to Penn State, and really the town of State College as a whole, the ripple effects of the scandal are hard for Mr Andreozzi's client to handle. 'The general public may think that an abuse victim in his position would automatically have feelings of negativity towards the university and while I think he's very disappointed in the way that members of the University community handled his situation or the situation involving the cove rup, it's a complex issue and we need to understand that he has a variety of thoughts going through his head right now,' Mr Andreozzi said. The civil suit is the first of its kind in this scandal, as so far Sandusky and two other university administrators have only been criminally charged. Disturbing: 'Sometimes they don't want it, sometimes they don't understand what you're trying to do but they want to be disciplined,' he said in the 1987 interview . Tom Corbett, the governor of Pennsylvania, thinks that this is not the end of the case either and he expects more victims to come forward now that the incidents are public. 'When the word gets out, when people understand that authorities are actually doing something about this, that they may be believed, then more people come forward, Mr Corbett said to Fox News Sunday.

The firm jaw, the determined look, the hint of a confident smile - features that would later inspire the millions he led to victory over Nazi Germany. Taken when he was 18, these previously unseen images of Winston Churchill have emerged through the sale of an album belonging to a titled family which has chosen to remain anonymous. The pictures, taken in 1892 when William Gladstone was prime minister and photography was still the preserve of the wealthy, show Churchill alongside his brother Jack. The brothers take it in turns to pose with a terrier outside their Aunt Cornelia's home in Canford Magna near Bournemouth. With a terrier on his lap, Winston poses with his brother Jack outside their Aunt Cornelia's home in Canford Magna near Bournemouth . The dog changes hands and this time Winston stands and his brother sits. Leaning casually against a pillar he gives the camera a charming smile . There is also a picture of the boys' mother Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill. The American socialite, who was . born in New York, leans elegantly against one of the property's columns. Shortly after the pictures were taken, Winston fell 29ft from a bridge and almost died. He had been chased by his brother and . a cousin and, not wanting to be caught, leapt for a tree hoping to slide . down it, but fell instead. He ruptured a kidney and was in a coma for three days. His father sent the best London doctors down to the coast to treat him. It was as he lay recovering that Winston learned he had failed to get into the Royal Military Academy, . Sandhurst for the second time. He got in at the third attempt. Elegant: Churchill's mother Jennie, Lady Randolph Churchill, looks poised as she leans against a column. The socialite was born in 1854 in Brooklyn, New York . Affectionate: Jack and Winston with their mother Jennie in a charming and relaxed family portrait . The images showing his younger . brother John - known as 'Jack' - are also of interest because his life . was overshadowed by his elder brother. Jack fought in the Boer War - where . Winston worked as a journalist - and World War I and was mentioned in . Dispatches in both conflicts. During World War II he moved into . No.10 Downing Street after his home was bombed in the Blitz by the . Luftwaffe. He worked as a banker in the City of London and died in 1947. The album of 150 images is being sold by auctioneers Bonhams on November 22 and it is expected to fetch £3,000. A spokesman from the saleroom said: . 'Churchill is such an iconic figure that anything new about him always . causes great excitement. 'In one of these photographs the . young Churchill is striking the kind of confident pose that many years . later would become familiar to millions of people round the world. 'And it is not too fanciful to see in these very relaxed early family images the inspirational leader he was to become.' Within two years of these photographs . being taken Churchill attended the Royal Military Academy, Sandhurst . where his adventures as an army officer and journalist began. He travelled to Cuba and saw the Spanish fight the Cuban guerrillas and . wrote about the conflict for the British newspaper, the Daily Graphic. It was while he was there that he acquired a taste for Havana cigars, which he would smoke for the rest of his life. He also saw action on the North West Frontier of India and in Sudan. While working as a journalist during the Boer War he was captured and . made a prisoner-of-war before making a daring escape. Already in a confident pose at the age of seven, left,  his determined look stares out from portraits taken as he grows older.

It was this escape which made him a minor national hero for a time in Britain, although instead of returning home, he rejoined General Buller's army and was among the first British troops to relieve the British at the Siege of Ladysmith and take Pretoria in South Africa. Churchill was born at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire on November 30, 1874 to the aristocratic family of the Dukes of Marlborough. His father was the charismatic and prominent Tory politician, Lord Randolph Churchill, who served as Chancellor of the Exchequer. His mother, Jennie Jerome, was an American socialite. Rebellious by nature, Churchill generally did poorly at school which he started in Dublin. He later attended three independent schools: St. George's School, Ascot, Berkshire; Brunswick School in Hove, and then Harrow, where his military career began. He eventually left the army in 1899 to take up politics. His political career began when he won the Conservative Party seat at Oldham in 1900, however having become disaffected with the party he joined the Liberals four years later. As President of the Board of Trade in Asquith’s Liberal government he set up labour exchanges and unemployment insurance. As Home Secretary in 1910 he improved safety in the mines and prevented the employment of child miners, although he disappointed radicals by deploying troops in Wales during a miners' strike. Churchill became Prime Minister in May 1940 when Britain was at war with Germany, following the resignation of Neville Chamberlain. He died on January 24, 1965 and was given a state funeral. Since his death, Churchill’s stature has continued to grow. He was recently voted ‘Greatest Ever Briton’ in a major BBC poll, beating Isambard Kingdom Brunel and Charles Darwin.","Family album images emerge of man who would lead Britain to victory over Nazi Germany .

Maybe our military could whip some of you into shape.' Meanwhile, protesters are facing off with authorities across the country as officers step up pressure against the demonstrators. In Portland, police in riot gear Sunday surrounded demonstrators in a downtown park area after hundreds of people defied the mayor's order to leave the park by midnight. By early afternoon, officers had mostly surrounded the camp where the protesters were holding a ""general assembly"" meeting to discuss their next moves following the eviction order. Some officers used nightsticks to push people away from the encampment and used loudspeakers to warn that anyone who resisted risked arrest and 'may also be subject to chemical agents and impact weapons.' Demonstrators chanted 'we are a peaceful protest.' Police could be seen carrying at least one protester away from the park. Another man was taken away on a stretcher; he was alert and talking to paramedics, and raised a peace sign to fellow protesters, who responded with cheers. There was no immediate word on arrests. Protester Mike Swain, 27, told The Associated Press: 'We were talking about what we were going to do and then they just started hitting people. Seems like a waste of resources to me.' Diss from a rose: An Occupy Portland protester offers police a flower after the deadline for them to vacate a park passed early this morning . Disobedience: In Portland, protesters and their supporters flooded a downtown city park area this morning in defiance of a midnight deadline to disperse was set by city officials . At one point the numbers swelled to thousands but then started to thin in the early morning hours. Protest organizers in Portland said they hope enough people will join them to make it difficult if not impossible for police to carry through on any eviction. 'Occupy the street,' one organizer said through a bull horn. 'Remain peaceful and aware. We have strength in holding the streets.' Mayor Sam Adams had ordered the camp shut down, citing unhealthy conditions and the encampment's attraction of drug users and thieves. Police numbers shifted throughout the night, but they showed no signs of moving against the protesters. Around 4 a.m. a line of about 200 police stretched across a street and in front of a federal courthouse. Protesters facing them appeared to be in a festive spirits with some banging on plastic pails, another clanging a cowbell while others danced in the streets as a man juggled nearby. Police had prepared for a possible clash, warning earlier that dozens of anarchists may be planning a confrontation with authorities. Crackdown: Police in Denver forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment and arrested four people for interfering with officers who removed illegally pitched tents . Officers seized pieces of cement blocks Friday, saying they were told some demonstrators had plans to use them as weapons against police. They've declared a war on corporate greed, but the Occupy Wall Street movement is costing small businesses big time. 'Occupied' coffee shops and . restaurants near Zuccotti Park are chasing away the regular clientele, . and the owners of the establishments are taking a nearly $500,000 hit. A survey conducted by the New York . Post showed that the businesses, which also include jewellery stores and . hair salons have collectively lost about $479,400 since the protest . began on September 17. one business owner told the paper: . 'We’re done with them! My customers used to take food to eat in the . park, but now they can't.' The staggering total does not even . include the money lost on toilet paper and supplies to clean and repair . bathrooms that used more than ever, thanks to protesters. As the movements shows no signs of slowing, business owners don't know where to turn. One proprietor told the paper that the regular customers - now scared away - are 'what keeps the lights on in this place.' Police spokesman Lt. Robert King told the AP: 'They said they believe some demonstrators are building shields and trying to collect gas masks. 'We'll take action that's appropriate, when it's appropriate.' 'We are not going to engage in confrontation for a misdemeanour,' he said, noting that is the legal violation for remaining in the park after midnight. It appeared earlier that about 200 campers planned to get arrested. But police action seemed less likely after the crowds swelled the parks in the early morning hours. In the hours leading up to midnight, protesters held general assembly meetings where they talked about what to do when the deadline came. The also repeated the main message of Occupy Wall Street movement of peaceful resistance to income inequality and what they see as corporate greed. As those speeches were going on, some snacked on coffee and burritos as others sang protest songs. About 60 bicycle riders circled the camp repeatedly to show support. 'We are a peaceful resistance,' said rider Chico Tallman, a 63-year-old accountant. 'But we're fed up with the direction the country is going. It's all about profit.' Face-off: Nineteen people were arrested in Salt Lake City after police protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man was found dead inside his tent at the encampment . In Philadelphia, a protester with a criminal past was quickly arrested after he allegedly raped a woman in her tent, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported. The 50-year-old suspect, who was not named, was booked after the 25-year-old victim called 911 to report the attack. In Salt Lake City, police arrested 19 people last night when protesters refused to leave a park a day after a man was found dead inside his tent at the encampment. The arrests came after police moved into the park early in the evening where protesters had been ordered to leave by the end of the day. About 150 people had been living in the camp there for weeks. Authorities in Denver forced protesters to leave a downtown encampment and arrested four people for interfering with officers who removed illegally pitched tents, said police spokesman Sonny Jackson. Mr Jackson said police had advised protesters since Wednesday that their tents in Civic Center Park and on a nearby sidewalk were illegal. Violence marked the protest in San Francisco yesterday where police said two demonstrators attacked two police officers in separate incidents during a march. Detained: Lionel Tiepanlev was one of 19 people taken into custody in Salt Lake City after protesters refused to leave the Occupy encampment in the city . Police spokesman Carlos Manfredi said a protester slashed an officer's hand with a pen knife while another protester shoved an officer, causing facial cuts. He said neither officer was seriously hurt, and the assailants couldn't be located. Meanwhile, in Southern California a small group of protesters braved soggy weather yesterday to gather for the first time under the banner of Occupy Inland Empire. Members of Occupy movements in Fontana, Redlands, Riverside, and other nearby towns marched past banks and in front of San Bernardino City Hall in what they called a 'visibility action,' The Sun newspaper reported. Last night, Occupy Portland protesters dismantled large sections of their encampment, but dozens of tents remained after midnight. For the second time in as many days, Oakland city officials warned protesters that they do not have the right to camp in the plaza in front of City Hall and face immediate arrest. The eviction notices come as officials across the country urged an end to similar gatherings in the wake of three deaths in different cities, including two by gunfire. Demands for Oakland protesters to pack up increased after a man was shot and killed Thursday near the encampment site. Restless: Police use their bikes to barricade Occupy Portland protesters as the city enforced a deadline to leave a city park . 'Your activities are injurious to health, obstruct the free use of property, interfering with the comfortable enjoyment of [Frank Ogawa Plaza], and unlawfully obstruct the free passage or use of a public park or square,' the notice read. Oakland officials first issued the eviction notice Friday after first pleading with protesters to leave the encampment. Police officials have said a preliminary investigation suggested the shooting resulted from a fight between two groups of men at or near the encampment. Investigators do not know if the men in the fight were associated with Occupy Oakland, but protesters said there was no connection between the shooting and the camp. The shooting occurred the same day a 35-year-old military veteran apparently committed suicide in a tent at a Burlington, Vermont, Occupy encampment. Police said a preliminary investigation showed the veteran fatally shot himself in the head. They said the death raised questions about whether the protest would be allowed to continue.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:54 PM on 7th November 2011 . Calls for the Government to ditch its plans to raise the motorway speed limit were dismissed yesterday. The M5 crash led to safety campaigners urging the Coalition to abandon plans to increase the 70mph limit to 80mph. But drivers' groups immediately accused them of 'circling like vultures over the M5 dead' and Transport Secretary Justine Greening insisted it was too early to say whether speed caused the pile-up. Tragedy: As the stretch of the M5 reopened today after the 34 car pile up, safety campaigners and driving groups have become embroiled in a war of words over speed limits . Aftermath: As a fingertip search was conducted yesterday, safety campaigners called for the Coalition to abandon plans to increase speed limits . 'Some people have said the weather was particularly bad,' she said. 'What we need to do now is focus on what's happening to the people who have been injured. We'll have a debate about the policy issues in the coming weeks.' But Jo Bullock, spokesman for the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, said: 'We have said from the beginning that we would not support an increase in the speed limit. 'Higher speed means less time for . drivers to react to what's going on around them. Our concern is that . there will be more serious accidents.' And Ellen Booth, senior campaigns . officer at Brake said: 'Government policy should not be doing anything . to increase the number of man-made, unnatural deaths occurring.' Tragedy: Was speed an issue? In the days after the accident safety campaigners and drivers' groups have been at odds over the crash . Fireball: Fire crews from Devon and Somerset Fire Brigade tackling a blaze on Friday evening, since the crash a war of words has erupted over 80mph speed limits . 'Like a war zone': The mangled vehicles at the crash scene on Saturday as police worked to clear the wreckage. 51 people were injured and seven killed in the 34 vehicle pile-up . Too early: Transport Secretary Justine Greening said it is not yet clear if speed was the cause of the pile up . But Brian Gregory, Chairman of the Association of British Drivers, issued a press release under the title 'Road Safety Charities Are Like Circling Vultures Over M5 Dead'. He said: 'Accidents aren't caused by a “number on a pole” and the M5 disaster will be shown to be no exception. 'It is clear that the accident involved a number of HGVs limited to 56mph and below, plus there are question marks over the wisdom of holding a firework display adjacent to the motorway.' Tory MP Margot James agreed there shouldn't be a rush to judgment. 'We don't know how fast people were driving. 'I don't think people were driving that fast anyway, from the reports I've heard from the people interviewed who survived the accident. So I'm not sure it was the speed that was causing the problem.' A full risk assessment is needed of measures to increase the maximum motorway speed limit from 70mph to 80mph, a motoring group said today. Today, the Institute of Advanced Motorists (IAM) called on the Government to pilot an 80mph limit on a controlled and managed motorway 'to assess its practicality and safety and road users' reaction'. IAM chief executive Simon Best said: 'A fifth of motorway-users already travel at this increased speed, and more than half exceed 72mph when they can, suggesting that a properly controlled 80mph limit may not show huge increases in carbon or road casualties. 'A detailed trial is needed to assess these risks though, and if they are shown to increase significantly, of course a better-enforced 70 limit may be a more appropriate system.' Blame: Ian Gregory, Chairman of the Association of British Drivers, said: 'Accidents aren't caused by a ''number on a poll'' and the M5 disaster will be shown to be no exception . He went on: 'Raising the motorway . speed limit has been debated for many years, and the evidence is that . the motoring public are ready for it. The Transport Secretary should now . publish a consultation with firm proposals.' Earlier this autumn the then . transport secretary Philip Hammond announced that the Government would . be launching a consultation on raising the limit to 80mph. He said the current speed limit was . nearly 50 years old and was out of date thanks to huge advances in . safety and motoring technology. Mr Hammond said an increase to 80mph . would generate economic benefits of hundreds of millions of pounds . through shorter journey times.","Safety campaigners urge the government to abandon plans for increased limit in wake of tragedy .

Dorothy Sandusky has been married to alleged child rapist Jerry Sandusky since the 1960s and the indictment says abuse took place in their home . Jerry Sandusky’s wife has been largely absent from the analysis of who knew what about her husband’s alleged sexual abuse of eight boys over a 15-year period. But Dorothy 'Dottie' Gross Sandusky does make an appearance in the 23-page Grand Jury indictment which graphically details the charges against the 67-year-old former Penn State coach. Mrs Sandusky, 68, attempted to call one of the victims in the weeks leading up to his testimony, despite the fact the now 26-year-old had cut off all contact with Sandusky two years prior. She left a message on Victim 7's phone saying the matter was 'very important' but the man, who told the Grand Jury that as a ten-year-old in 1994, Sandusky hugged and inappropriately touched him, did not return the call. Part of that alleged abuse took place in the Sandusky family’s State College, Pennsylvania, home, in which Dorothy and her husband raised their six adopted children. Sandusky claimed he and his wife could not have any of their own. Over the years the couple became the parents to Ray, now 46, a businessman living in Nashville, EJ, 41, former Nittany Lions player, and now a football coach at West Chester University, Kara, 38, a Penn State graduate, Jeff, 35, a former Marine, and 33-year-olds Matt, a Penn State graduate and Jon, who is Director of Player Personnel for the Cleveland Browns. Quite how much any of them knew about the sexual abuse, which occurred between 1994 and 2009 with a number of incidents at the family home, is now under scrutiny. The former Penn State defensive coordinator and his lawyer, Joe Amendola, have maintained that Sandusky is innocent and publicly denied all allegations. Neither Dorothy Sandusky nor any of her adopted children have yet made a statement on the scandal. Handcuffed: Eight young men have been identified . as the targets of sexual advances or assaults by Sandusky from 1994 to . 2009, prosecutors said . Idyllic: Authorities say Jerry Sandusky's home in State College, Pennsylvania, was one of the places he . sexually abused several boy . Jerry Sandusky's book Touched, which was released in 2001 . The Grand Jury indictment states that . Sandusky selected his young victims from the 'Second Mile', a charity he . started in 1977 devoted to helping troubled boys in the State College . area. Mrs Sandusky helped out with the running of the programme. 'After we had taken in some foster children, we saw the opportunities that some kids just hadn't had,' Mrs Sandusky told Sports Illustrated in 1982. 'But we'd gotten to the point where we couldn't take in anymore, so Jerry started thinking about starting a group home.' In his 2000 autobiography, 'Touched: The Jerry Sandusky Story' the onetime heir apparent to Joe Paterno devotes many pages to his relationships with boys he met through the Second Mile. He also makes reference to his own children during an exchange with some of the boys from the charity. Sandusky wrote that one night he was talking to two Second Mile boys who had rebelled against their foster parents, with one boy telling how his foster father had 'grabbed me around the back of my shoulders and he made me do something when I didn't want to do it.' 'Do you ever grab your kids like that?' the boy asked Sandusky. 'No, I don't grab my kids like that,' Sandusky answered. 'I grab them like this.' He wrote: 'With that, I put my hands . gently around their throat.' It was an apparent jest. 'I could tell they were totally confused,' Sandusky wrote. 'Both boys had a scared look in their eyes.' The . book repeatedly described Sandusky hugging boys and detailing how he . was very close to those he met through the charity. Of the photos that line his office walls, he said: 'They are kids that have touched my . life and have been a part of me for a long, long time.' In the book he paints himself as someone who would repeatedly take risks in the hunt for what he refers to as 'mischief.' 'I . believe I live a good part of my life in a make-believe world,' Sandusky wrote in one of the final chapters. 'I enjoyed pretending as a . kid, and I love doing the same as an adult with these kids.' Whether . Mrs Sandusky was worried by any such behaviour is not yet known. What . is established is that she has been by Sandusky’s side since the . mid-1960s, when they married. Originally . from Chattanooga, Tennessee, she had met Sandusky in Washington a few . years before. He endearingly called his wife 'Sarge,' because she was in . charge in their home, ESPN News reported. Losers today: Penn State narrowly lost their NCAA college football game against Nebraska at the Beaver Stadium in State College, Pennsylvania today . Former leaders: Jerry Sandusky (left) was the defensive line coach under head coach Joe Paterno (right) before Sandusky retired in 1999 . The shocking Grand Jury indictment makes repeated accusations that victims were abused inside the couple’s home. Victim 1 spent many nights there sleeping in a basement bedroom. The report states that Sandusky would come down to the basement to check on him at bedtime. The report found that Sandusky 'indecently fondled Victim 1 on a number of occasions, performed oral sex on Victim 1 on a number of occasions and had Victim 1 perform oral sex on him on at least one occasion.' Phone records also confirm that Sandusky made 61 phone calls from his home phone to Victim 1's home phone between January 2008 and July 2009 despite Victim 1 expressing a wish that he no longer wanted to see the football coach. The defensive coordinator also made 57 calls from his personal cell phone to Victim 1's home phone. Heyday: Jerry Sandusky (centre) is a star in football circles as he is closely identified with the school's reputation as a defensive powerhouse . Despite these actions, there is no suggestion whatsoever in the indictment that Mrs Sandusky was aware of her husband's sexual relations with Victim 1 or any of the other seven victims. Experts have suggested that she and her children could well have been kept in the dark. '[Abusers are] very good at hiding it from everyone,' clinical social worker Farlie Chastain told WRCB TV. 'Very good at seducing the child and manipulating the child not to tell.' However, Chastain, who counsels sexually abused children and teenagers at Parkridge Valley, Tennesee and at Foxus Psychiatric Services in Tennessee Valley, adds: 'I've seen it both ways, in which the family knows and is in denial.' Meanwhile State College police have reported that someone threw two cinder blocks through a bedroom window at Sandusky’s house on Thursday night. The news came as it emerged that the accused child rapist, who is out on bail, lives close to an elementary school and playground.","Dorothy Sandusky called Victim 7 before he gave evidence despite him cutting contact with former football coach two years prior .

Two-year-old Jack Ayton needed 20 stitches in his face after the dog sank its jaws into his nose, lips, cheek, and eyebrows.

The toddler's family are now calling for the pet to be put down to avoid further attacks. His mother Aimee, 21, a part-time support worker, said: 'I had a phone call from the childminder to say ""I'm so sorry, we're in A&E. Jack's been attacked by a dog. You have to come up."" 'I was in total shock, I phoned my dad and we rushed up there to see what had happened. I expected the worst, but it was more awful than even that. 'He was in surgery for 90 minutes - it was horrific. He was lucky not to have been blinded in his right eye.' The attack happened last Wednesday . morning after Miss Tonks, who is registered with Ofsted, had collected . him from his playgroup in Gloucester. But instead of taking him home she took him to visit a relative who owns the Alsatian cross dog. She says the attack happened after Jack pulled the animal's tail in the kitchen. After the attack Jack was rushed to Gloucester Royal Hospital, where he was treated for six hours. Jack's granddad Phil Hicks, 44, said: 'His eyebrow was open and his lip looked like it had another lip coming from it. 'Jack had to have about eight stitches in his eyebrow, another six on the left side of his lip and more inside his mouth. He was in a terrible state.' Miss Tonks will be interviewed by Ofsted this week and the organisation has the power to revoke her registered childminder status.

She said: 'I reported it to Ofsted as soon as I could. They are coming to talk to me. 'It's . a really unfortunate thing to have happened. I would not become a . registered childminder to purposely have a dog attack a child. 'I have two children - they are my life. I will probably be shut down now because of this.

Asked whether she thought it appropriate to take Jack to a house with a dog, Laura said: 'I spoke to Aimee and she had said do what you like with him.' Single mother Aimee and her family have asked Gloucestershire Constabulary to intervene, but officers say they are powerless to take action because the incident happened on private land. Jack was back in hospital today having his stitches removed under general anaesthetic. A spokesman for Gloucestershire Constabulary said: 'Our thoughts are with the child and his family at this time.

Luxury: Sue in her top-of-the range kitchen which she had built to make life 'more comfortable' When Sue Pickard discovered she had terminal cancer she vowed to make the most of the 18 months doctors said she had left to live. The grandmother-of-three used a £30,000 insurance pay-out to fulfill her 'bucket list' of final wishes. She splashed out £10,000 doing up her home in Bedworth, Warwickshire and thousands of pounds on a flat-screen TV and luxury sofas. The 47-year-old even piled on four stone eating in expensive restaurants. But then she was given another bombshell - she was told the cancer had vanished. She was understandably 'thrilled' but added: 'I just thought to myself ''My God I've spent £30,000 and I'm the size of a house"".' Mrs Pickard, who has two grown-up daughters, worked full time at a GP surgery before she was diagnosed with cancer. Doctors discovered a three-inch tumour in her cervix in February last year. After a CT scan doctors found the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes. Sue began gruelling chemotherapy sessions three times a week days after . her diagnosis and also underwent 10 weeks of radiotherapy this summer. Sue said: 'The consultant said he was really sorry but he estimated I had between 12 and 18 months left. 'I was absolutely devastated and didn't know what to do. I just sat and sobbed.' Her and her husband Tony, 54, received the payout having taken out critical care cover on their mortgage years earlier. They forked out on holidays and spent £900 a month eating out every night at restaurants and pubs. In just a few months she had ballooned in weight after piling on nearly four stone until she tipped the scales at 19 stone 11lbs. But in September, just weeks before she was expected to die, doctors told Sue her radiotherapy and chemotherapy had worked and the cancer had vanished. The mother-of-two said: 'I was shell-shocked when the doctors told me I wasn't going to die. High life: Sue and husband Tony indulge in beers during one of many nights out they enjoyed during their spending spree . 'I was thrilled but I just thought to myself ''My God I've spent £30,000 and I'm the size of a house. I couldn't believe it, I'd prepared myself for death and even planned what songs to play at my funeral. 'After I was diagnosed with cancer I . had chemotherapy and radiotherapy to try and reduce the tumour but I . always thought it might only give me a few months more. 'Tony and I decided to enjoy every last second we had left together so blew the money on eating out and holidays. 'Me and Tony always loved pub meals so ate out all the time. We went away in our caravan most weekends and lived it up. I would always have chips and we'd have curries, fish and chips and chicken in the basket seven days a week.' She added: 'The money was supposed to cover the mortgage repayments in the event of either me or Tony getting critically ill. Family: Sue watches her grandson play in his expensive new toy car she bought for him after believing it would be their last Christmas together . 'Tony told me he wanted me to enjoy my last few months. All our family agreed and we just spent it all. 'I didn't cook once, we just went out to the pub or restaurant or got takeaways. 'I didn't care about putting the weight on because in my mind I was going to die anyway so what was the point of dieting? 'I even gave my bike away just indulged myself by eating lots of food I enjoyed.' Sue was given the surprising . all-clear in September and doctors told her she does not need any . further treatment but must have a check-up every three months to ensure . the cancer does not return. She has now enlisted the help of . hypnotherapist Russell Hemmings, who runs Bridge Therapy Clinic in . Coventry, to help her lose the weight. He said: 'Sue has already overcome incredible odds to beat terminal cancer so losing weight will not be a problem for her. 'She is absolutely motivated and wants to succeed which is half the battle.' Recovered: Sue Pickard in front of the new conservatory that she splashed out on during a spending and eating spree after being told she had terminal cancer . As well as eating and drinking out every night of the week they spent £10,000 building a new conservatory on their home. They also forked out on scores of mini-breaks in their caravan. Sue said: 'When I was diagnosed with cancer I left my job and Tony just said ''right lets go and enjoy ourselves''. 'I wasn't able to go too far because the chemotherapy did tire me but we went all over the country in our caravan. 'We loved going to the Dorset coast, Cornwall and especially Skegness and Wales. 'It didn't matter what the weather was like, every Friday we'd jump in the car and tow the caravan to a different campsite. 'We ate out all the time too, we must have eaten in over a hundred different restaurants and pubs. 'I love travelling and going away with Tony and our family every weekend helped take my mind off the cancer. 'I wanted to cram as much happiness into my last few months as possible. 'I saw sunsets and sunrises all over the country and basically indulged myself with food and pleasure. 'One of my favourite times was when we stayed on a farm near our home and the sheep were lambing. 'I had always wanted to hold a newborn lamb and my husband told the farmer and he let me hold one.

Matthew Newbury, the first UK patient to receive a new bionic prosthetic leg system 'Genium' He lost a leg in a motorcycle accident but property developer Matthew Newbury has no trouble scaling the ladders and scaffolding on his building sites. He is the first Briton to be fitted with the latest state-of-the-art bionic limb and says it has transformed his life. Mr Newbury, who lost his left leg above the knee, has had prosthetic replacements before but none have allowed him to move as freely as the £50,000 Genium. He can even ski and walk backwards. 'The difference is just vast,' said Mr Newbury, 30. 'With my old leg, a lot of the time I'd be walking gingerly, avoiding tripping up, but now I can walk with much more confidence, I can climb stairs in a much more natural way. 'But the best thing is I'm not tired all the time. I have my life back. I can go out for drinks and dinner until late without feeling exhausted.' He is so happy with his 'super limb' that he says it works better than his right leg, which survived the 1997 accident but was badly damaged. Mr Newbury, of central London, was 15 when the motorbike he was a pillion passenger on was struck from behind. He spent more than 18 months in hospital and rehabilitation. In 2004 he was awarded £2.1million compensation, as well as more money for his accommodation needs – and blew some of the cash on a Porsche with the number plate HA5 1 LEG. He also used it to set up a building company and he is now said to be worth more than £9million. The combination of motion and speed sensors and advanced computing mean that the Genium, made by German firm Otto Bock Healthcare, can detect small changes in movement and direction. This makes it better than other models at changing the rigidity of the knee, providing better balance and stability. Cycling, skiing, golf and table tennis are all possible. New lease on life: Matthew's leg's new technology means he can programme the limb to suit the day's activities .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 10:36 AM on 13th November 2011 . The world is getting warmer. And scientists have got an alarming video to prove it. According to researchers from the Berkeley Earth . Surface Temperatures project (BEST) from Berkeley University in California, the Earth's average global land temperature has risen by 1C since the 1950s. Led by controversial physicist, Professor Richard Muller, they used data from 1800 to 2009 to present their 'irrefutable' proof. However, mutiny within the BEST ranks has cast doubt on their findings - much to the delight of climate change sceptics. Scroll down for video . Warming up: The temperature of the Earth in 2009 with the hot spots illustrated on the glowing world map and the cooler areas in blue . Colder: The world in 1800 was cooler. Scientists at Berkeley University, led by controversial physicist Richard Muller, gathered a billion weather reports in the past 200 years . Professor Judith Curry was one of ten experts attempting to compile the definitive temperature data. She claimed it had been ‘tarnished’ by Prof Muller ‘overselling’ the results in favour of global warming - and she has threatened to quit the project. Prof Curry, of the School of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in the U.S., said their data actually showed . average world temperatures had ‘paused’ since the late 1990s. She also said that a graph . published on the project’s website depicting temperatures from 1850 to . 2006 appeared to ‘hide the decline’. Berkeley Earth's land surface temperature (BEST) data was taken from 1.6 billion temperature archived records dating back to the 1800s from 15 sources around the world. It shows deviation from the mean temperature . over two centuries - and overall global warming since the industrial . revolution. To highlight their findings, BEST researchers put all the data into one alarming video of a warming world visualising surface temperature records. How the Earth was in 1850 with huge swathes of the world cool . Fifty years on: Earth in 1900 starting to show signs of heating up (just like the climate change debate would many years later) The 1C rise in temperature matches estimates by the world's respected climate watchers who maintain official records. These include the Met Office with the University of East Anglia, Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York and the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. Prof Muller told the Guardian: 'My hope is that this will win over those people who are properly sceptical. Poles apart: BEST team leader Prof Richard Muller, left, says the latest . findings settle the climate debate once and for all. But Prof Judith . Curry says such a claim is 'a mistake' 'Some people lump the sceptical in with the deniers and that makes it easy to dismiss them, because the deniers pay no attention to science.' Muller's survey - the biggest open database of . temperature records - was focused on producing a transparent and . independent assessment of global warming. Global warming doubters have always criticised official figures on the grounds that many temperature stations . are poor quality and that data is tweaked by hand. But the Berkeley study found that the . so-called 'urban heat' which makes cities warmer than surrounding rural . areas, did not significantly contribute to average land temperature . rises. Rising temperature: The world in 1950. Scientists wanted transparent data to counter doubts by climate change sceptics . Here we glow: The way the world was in 2000 with heat spots shown in burning red . This, said the Guardian, is because . urban regions make up less than one per cent of the Earth's land area. And . while ' poor' stations might be less accurate, they recorded . the same average warming trend . The U.S. team includes Saul Perlmutter, joint winner of this year's Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery that the universe is expanding at an increasing rate. It has gone public before publication by submitting four papers to the journal Geophysical Research Letters. Muller said: 'We have looked at these issues in a straightforward, transparent way, and based on that, I would expect legitimate sceptics to feel their issues have been addressed.' The research has won backing from Peter Thorne at the Cooperative Institute for Climate and Satellites in North Carolina and chair of the International Surface Temperature Initiative. He told the paper: 'This takes a very distinct approach to the problem and comes up with the same answer, and that builds confidence that pre-existing estimates are in the right ballpark. 'Openness and transparency is a must, particularly now with climate change being so politicised.' But one U.S. climate sceptic, Anthony . Watts, claimed he had identified a 'basic procedural error' concerning . time periods used in the research, and urged the authors to revise the . paper. And the project has been attacked by some climate bloggers, who point out that one of the sponsors runs a company Greenpeace have branded a 'financial kingpin of climate science denial'.","Controversial physicist Richard Muller believes his findings will 'address the issues of legitimate sceptics'

A ‘callous' barmaid hatched a cover story with her uninsured boyfriend to ‘save their own skins’ moments after he killed a cyclist in her car. Lauren Mellish, 22, was in the vehicle with Alex Dexter, 23, when he  overtook three vehicles in the powerful Ford Puma before losing control and ploughing into Steven Rodway, 38. As the married father-of-two lay dying under the car, the couple were seen whispering together to concoct a story involving someone else taking it on a test drive. Aiding and abetting: Lauren Mellish (left) was jailed for six months after making up a cover story with boyfriend Alex Dexter (right) to get them off the hook . Mellish eventually confessed the truth . two weeks later and wept in court today as she became the first person . to be convicted of aiding and  abetting a driver who caused death by . careless driving. She was given a six-month term for the . offence, which was created under the Road Safety Act 2006. The maximum . penalty is two years. Dexter, who only held a provisional . licence when he got behind the wheel of her car, looked visibly shaken . as he was given a 15-month term after admitting  three charges including . causing death by careless driving and causing death  while uninsured. Speaking after the hearing at . Chelmsford Crown Court, Essex, Inspector Keith Whiting said: ‘They got . out of the car and made up a story to cover themselves  without offering . Steven any assistance. Victim: Married father-of-two Steven Rodway was killed in the accident . ‘I have never known such callous actions at the scene of a fatal collision.’ Mr Rodway’s widow Marrissa, 35, said . she now lived for their children Harriet, six, and Erica, two, but . always felt lonely without her ‘soul mate’. She added: ‘Alex Dexter and Lauren . Mellish have turned our lives upside down and I know I will find it hard . to forgive them for the heartache they have caused our family.’ Dexter, an engineer, was seen . overtaking three cars before losing control as he tried to avoid a . transit van on June 13 last year. The vehicle rolled down the road in . Stapleford Tawney, near Epping, before coming to rest on its wheels on . top of insurance worker Mr Rodway, who lived in Hutton, near Brentwood, . and was out on a Sunday afternoon bike ride. After climbing out of the overturned car, Dexter told a fireman that ‘another  male had been driving the car’ and had run off. Mellish also lied, saying that a man she knew only as 'Matt' had been test  driving the car and then escaped after the accident. Witnesses described seeing the pair - . who have since split up – ‘whispering to  each other’, adding they . ‘didn’t seem concerned about the cyclist’. The false story led to police . launching a major search operation for the  fictional driver, including . calling out sniffer dogs which were sent into  surrounding fields. Both defendants refused to comment . during police interviews and it was only a fortnight later that Mellish . finally said Dexter had been driving. Both admitted the charges at a hearing last month. They were also banned from  driving for three years yesterday. Judge Christopher Ball QC said the . accident would not have happened if Mellish had not allowed her . boyfriend to drive and he had to send out a message to  anyone who . allows their uninsured partner to use their car. He added: ‘Perhaps worst of all was . your reaction at the scene. As Mr Rodway  lay dying underneath the car, . it was to try to save your own skins by inventing  a fictional third . person and try to identify him as the culpable driver.’","Couple concocted excuse as cyclist lay dying underneath their car .

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 3:00 PM on 11th November 2011 . The early years of a child's life are often most precious to their parents. But one mother lost all her recollections of her young sons - after she suffered brain damage in a car crash. Jenny Crow, 37, had just picked up her sons from primary school when she was involved in car accident in September 2009. It left her unable to remember most events from the last seven years of her life, including giving birth to her sons Harrison, 6, and Jackson, 5. Today: Jenny Crow, pictured with Harrison and Jackson, is rebuilding her life with her family following her devastating car accident . But she is now recovering from her injuries and is keen to build a a new life with her two sons. Her father Ron Spencer, 63, a painter and decorator, said: ‘Jenny is doing wonderfully well after everything that has happened. ‘She can’t remember giving birth to the boys as seven years of her memory have been totally wiped out. But she loves them dearly and is now carrying on with her life with them. ‘We are just grateful that she is still with us. We don’t know if her memory will ever fully return, but she is just taking each day as it comes.’ The smash happened as a pregnant Mrs Crow picked up her two young sons from school. They were strapped into their car seats in the back of her car when she collided head-on with a bus coming in the opposite direction. The boys were unhurt, but Mrs Crow was rushed to Peterborough District Hospital with two smashed thigh bones and a broken hip. She had an operation to repair her broken legs, but she remained in a coma for nearly three weeks. Sadly she lost her baby. Memory wipe: Jenny doesn't remember giving birth to her two children and can't recall their early lives . Mr Spencer, who lives with wife Lynette, 53, said: ‘She took the full impact of the crash. She was put on a ventilator and the doctors were really worried when she didn’t come out of the coma after four days, as they expected her to. ‘We kept talking to her, begging her to wake up. Eventually after nearly three weeks she opened her eyes and it was the most amazing moment. Her first words to me were ‘I love you’. Mrs Crow, who lives in Great Casterton in Rutland, spent the next 18 months at a rehabilitation centre in Cambridge where she learnt to walk and talk again. She also had daily physiotherapy treatment to help her walk. But even though she is slowly recovering movement she still can’t remember the previous seven years of her life. In hospital: Jenny lost her unborn child following the car accident . She had been six months pregnant with her third child at the time of the crash, and can’t remember being pregnant at all. She also can’t remember the birth of her two sons, her brother’s wedding and her son’s first day at school. Mr Spencer added: ‘Her long term memory is still good. She can remember things she did as a child. But she can’t remember the last few years before the crash. ‘We have had to tell her what happened in those seven years to fill in the gaps for her. She didn’t remember giving birth to the boys, but she knew who they were when she came out of her coma. ‘Its been a big incentive for her, to get better to come home for them.

Danger: A korma sauce bearing Loyd Grossman's name has been issued with a recall after two people were hospitalised with botulism poisoning . TV chef Loyd Grossman was today 'distressed and upset' after two children were taken to hospital with botulism after eating by his korma sauce. The two youngsters were rushed to hospital with the potentially deadly bug on Sunday after eating a meal prepared with the curry sauce over the weekend. It is not yet known how they came down with the illness but 47,000 jars of the sauce have now been recalled. Mr Grossman, who developed the recipe for the sauces, was 'in shock' after hearing about the apparent poisoning. His agent Peter Schnabl told MailOnline: 'Loyd is very upset and distressed at the minute. 'It was a such a big shock when he was told about the illness of the children. He's devastated. It's all very upsetting. 'Loyd's not just putting his name to the products, it's a full involvement. 'We're furiously trying to figure out what has happened. 'Loyd will be leading the charge in finding out who's responsible. He's not happy about it.' A spokeswoman for NHS Forth Valley said the two patients from the same family are in a 'stable and improving' condition. The Food Standards Agency has advised the public not to consume jars of the sauce as it may pose a risk of botulism poisoning. It said a batch of the korma sauce has been recalled and is being removed from shop shelves. The product recall relates to 350g jars of Loyd Grossman Korma sauce with a best-before date of February 2013 and a batch code of 1218R 07:21. The sauce is made by Premier Foods, the UK’s largest food manufacturer, which is responsible for more than 40 household brands including Mr Kipling, Hovis, Branston, Bisto and Oxo. Botulism is caused by toxins produced by the bacterium Clostridium botulinum, which is the deadliest naturally occurring poison in the world and attacks the nervous system. The illness can be fatal in up to 10 per cent of cases, and victims can take many months to recover. Symptoms of food-borne botulism, which include blurred vision and difficulty swallowing and speaking, can rapidly get worse and lead to muscle weakness and paralysis. They typically begin between 12 and 36 hours after eating a contaminated meal, but may appear in as little as six hours. Anyone suffering these symptoms after eating the product is being advised to seek medical help urgently. The infection cannot be spread from person to person. While the initial cases of illness have occurred in Scotland, the Food Standards Agency and Scottish health authorities have issued a UK-wide alert. The FSA said: ‘Anyone who has any of the jars from this batch of Loyd Grossman Korma sauce should not eat it. Setback: Grossman says his sauces use the best ingredients and that he personally insists on tasting each on new recipe until he knows it is just right . Botulism is a rare but serious illness which can lead to paralysis. It can be caused either by ingesting the botulinum toxin or by contamination in a wound. It cannot be transferred from person to person. Botulism can lead to paralysis which usually starts with the muscles in the face - particularly those in the eyes and those used for chewing - and spreads towards the limbs. In severe cases the breathing muscles can become paralysed, causing respiratory failure. Botulism can be prevented by killing the spores by cooking food about 121°C for three minutes. Treatment for respiratory paralysis can require a patient to be on a ventilator for weeks as well as being treated in intensive care. After several weeks, the paralysis usually slowly improves. ‘Two members of the same family who . have contracted botulism and have eaten from a jar of this batch of . sauce have been hospitalised in Scotland. ‘Only . one jar from the batch is known to have been contaminated with . Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism, but the agency is advising . people not to eat products from this batch as a precautionary measure.’ Dr John Cowden, consultant . epidemiologist at Health Protection Scotland, said: ‘People can be . reassured that botulism is rare in the UK. ‘Any person, child or adult, with the symptoms should seek urgent medical advice. Anti-toxins have proved very effective in treating the condition if treated early, although full recovery may take several months.’ The news will be a heavy blow to the reputation of the TV food guru’s line of products, which includes curry and pasta sauces. The products are marketed on the basis that they use ‘only the very best ingredients’. Mr . Grossman has promoted the sauces saying: ‘I love food and believe great . food comes from care and attention to detail. That’s why I insist on . tasting every recipe until it’s just right.’ Spores of Clostridium botulinum are normally found in soil and can get into food products via contamination of farmers’ fields. There . have been cases in the past – although extremely rare – of the spores . and associated toxin being found in food sold in cans and jars. The . NHS website says just 500g of the toxin ‘is enough to kill every human . being on the planet’, adding: ‘The toxins . . . block a special type of . chemical called a neurotransmitter. Neurotransmitters send messages from . your brain to the rest of your nervous system. ‘In . the case of botulism, the toxin blocks the effects of a . neurotransmitter called acetylcholine, which is used by your body to . help stimulate muscles. If acetylcholine is blocked, it causes paralysis . which, if left untreated, can lead to death.’A spokesman for Premier Foods, the makers of the sauce, said: 'The safety of consumers is of paramount importance to us.  At this stage, we understand that the incident relates to a single jar of Korma sauce.  There is no evidence of any broader contamination, no further reports of illness have been notified to the authorities and we have had no consumer complaints of illness related to this product. 'We are working urgently with the authorities to investigate the cause of this incident, including how the jar may have been transported and stored after leaving the factory. While these investigations are underway, we have initiated a precautionary recall of the specific batch code in the interests of the safety of our consumers.'","Sauces with best-before of February 2013 and batch code 1218R 07:21 are affected .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 11:51 AM on 15th November 2011 . Qaisar Shaffi says he was only interested in clothes, booze and recreational drugs . A convicted terror plotter has claimed he only went on an Al Qaeda reconnaissance mission because he wanted a free holiday. Qaisar Shaffi says he got involved in a mass murder plot 'for the thrill' and is now asking a top judge to pave the way for his release. He says he was only interested in clothes, alcohol and recreational drugs and was hoping for a 'free holiday' when he accompanied Al Qaeda operative Dhiren Barot on a reconnaissance trip to New York in 2001 to view targets for a bombing campaign. Shaffi, from Willesden, north London, was convicted in 2007 of conspiracy to murder and was handed a 15-year jail term. Including time spent on remand, he has now been held as a 'high risk' Category A prisoner for more than seven years and is currently behind bars at Long Lartin Prison, in Worcestershire. Shaffi will be considered for release by the parole board in February next year - after serving half his sentence - but stands no chance of early release whilst he remains in Category A, his barrister, Dan Squires, told London's High Court. Mr Justice Eady heard the Director of High Security has twice refused Shaffi's bid for a downgrade in his security rating - an essential preliminary to release - despite 'unanimous expert evidence' that he is no radical Jihadist and poses a low risk to society. Mr Squires said Shaffi's only involvement with Barot - who is serving a minimum 30-year sentence for conspiracy to murder - came in March 2001 when he accompanied him on a trip to New York, where prosecutors said Wall Street and the IMF Building were being 'scoped' for an attack. Qaisar Shaffi accompanied al-Qaeda operative, Dhiren Barot, on a reconnaissance trip to New York in 2001 to view targets for a bombing campaign . Shaffi, who worked at a mobile phone shop, only met Barot because he was a customer and agreed to fly across the Atlantic with him 'principally because it offered the opportunity of a free holiday', the barrister added. Barot was jailed for life in 2006 for plotting attacks in the US and the UK . Far from holding Islamic extremist views, Shaffi enjoyed a 'hedonistic' lifestyle at the time. 'He took recreational drugs and drank alcohol and his life revolved around clothes, music and partying', Mr Squires told the judge. He added that Shaffi, now 33, is a changed man with a long-term girlfriend, an 'exemplary record' in prison and his only wish on release is to return to his wife and peacefully build a family. Challenging the refusal to downgrade Shaffi from Category A, in which he is being held amongst many hardline extremists, Mr Squires said it flew in the face of expert views on the low risk he poses. He also argued it was 'unfair' not to grant him an oral hearing. Barot was jailed for life in 2006 for plotting attacks in the US and the UK using explosives-packed limousines and a 'dirty' radiation bomb. Prosecutors said he had intended a 'memorable black day' of terror. Six others admitted conspiring to cause explosions and were handed sentences of between 15 and 26 years. The High Court hearing continues.","Qaisar Shaffi says he was only interested in clothes, alcohol and recreational drugs .

Jordan's King Abdullah has said Syrian President Bashar Assad should step down making him the first Arab ruler to make such a call. Jordan has been critical of Syria's violent crackdown on anti-government protesters in recent months and the king said the country's leader should initiate a political dialogue. He told the BBC: 'I would step down and make sure whoever comes behind me has the ability to change the status quo that we're seeing. Step down: Jordan's King Abdullah, left, says Syrian President Bashar Assad, right, should retire to allow his country to start 'a new phase of political life' 'If Bashar has the interest of his country, he would step down, but he would also create an ability to reach out and start a new phase of Syrian political life'. At least 40 Syrians were killed in fighting on Monday between forces loyal to President Bashar al-Assad and insurgents in a town near the border with Jordan, local activists said, in the first case of major armed resistance to Assad in the region. The European Union on Monday decided to impose more sanctions on Syria to get Assad to halt his bloody crackdown on the eight-month uprising. The Arab League has also suspended Syria from its League membership - a move that has been hailed by the Foreign Secretary as 'strong measures'. Mr Hague today welcomed more EU sanctions against Syria in protest at President Assad's failure to end 'horrific violence'. He also approved the extension of European travel and financial restrictions to another 18 members of the regime's inner circle, . Seal of approval: Mr Hague has welcomed more EU sanctions against Syria in opposition to President Assad's failure to end the violence . Mr Hague said: 'President Assad has ignored countless calls by the international community to put an end to the horrific violence in Syria. 'Since the Syrian regime's claim to have agreed to the plan put forward by the Arab League on November 2, violence has only escalated with a death toll of over 3,500 people since March'. He added: 'As long as the violence continues, we will continue to press the Syrian regime to bring an end to this killing'. The 18 individuals added to a current list of 56 already targeted for European travel and visa bans and the freezing of any assets held in the EU have not been named. But they include security, military and intelligence officials known to be involved in or actively supporting the regime's activities. Mr Hague and his EU counterparts also agreed to halt loans to Syria from the European Investment Bank in a bid to further squeeze President Assad, whose country has received nearly £1.5bn from the EIB since 1978 to aid major infrastructure projects, crucially in its energy sector. In a statement the EU foreign ministers expressed deep concern about the deteriorating situation in Syria and condemned 'the ongoing brutal repression and widespread human rights violations'.","President Assad should allow his country to start 'a new phase of political life'

A Republican politician has sparked religious fury by demanding all Muslims be forced out of the U.S. military. Tennessee State Representative Rick Womick claimed serving Muslims posed a significant threat and needed to be kicked out of the armed forces because their religion commands them to lie. Interviewed on Veteran's Day by the Think Progress website he said: 'Personally I don't trust one Muslim in our military because they're commanded to lie to us. 'And if they really are a devout Muslim and follow the Koran and the and the Sunnah, then I feel threatened because they're commanded to kill me.' Mr Womick was attending the 'Preserving Freedom Conference hosted by the controversial group, the Sharia Awareness Action Network. Asked if he felt that serving Muslims should be 'forced out' he replied: 'Absolutely yes.' He later reasserted his opinions in an interview with the Murfreesboro Daily News adding: 'Who are we at war with? 'We are at war with al-Qaeda and the Taliban, who are Muslims. It's a Catch-22. They are not allowed to kill their fellow Muslims, we're at war with Muslims. 'The only solution I see is that they not be allowed in the military.' Womick, a Baptist and member of the National Rifle Association, served as a pilot in the Air Firce during the first Gulf War. The Washington-based Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) demanded the Tennessee General Assembly rebuke Womick for his comments. But he described them as a 'radical Islamic group'. Duty: There are an estimated 3500 Muslims serving within the U.S. armed forces . He added: 'Whatever they have to say, I choose to ignore.' Saleh Sbenaty of the Islamic Center of Murfreesboro told the Tenneseean: 'It's really sad to see Mr. Womick's comments coming on Veterans Day,' said Sbenaty. 'He needs to be reminded that there are thousands of Muslims who serve and are serving (in the U.S. military), and there are many of them who gave up their lives to preserve the freedom of this country and the freedom that he is enjoying.' There are an estimated six million Muslims living in the U.S. with around 3500 serving the military and many seeing action in Iraq and Afghanistan. Mr Sbenaty added: 'Al-Qaida doesn't believe in freedom of religion. 'They want to rule the world according to their views. And Mr. Womick wants to rule the United States according to his narrow vision.' In 2009 13 people were killed at Fort Hood in Texas after a Muslim officer allegedly went on a rampage yelling 'Allahu Akbar', weeks before he was due to serve in Afghanistan.

Nadia Boukhari, 43, hit Paul Duffy repeatedly over the head after saying she suffered two years of abuse at his hands. Her co-accused, John Green, 48, stabbed Mr Duffy in the back at a house close to the home they shared  in Stoke Newington, North London. Mr Duffy, a 40-year-old former boxer, hit her in the face after she refused to give him a cigarette moments before the attack took place. Nadia Boukhari (left) has been sentenced to seven years for killing her lover, Paul Duffy, while John Green (right) was sentenced to life with a minimum of 14 years . She was two months pregnant with their first child but suffered a miscarriage following the fight. The jury took just three hours to convict Green of murder while Boukhari was cleared of murder but found guilty of manslaughter following the three-week trial. Green was handed a life sentence with a minimum tariff of 14 years. Judge Brian Barker QC said they had killed Mr Duffy following an 'explosion of violent temper'. 'The behaviour in that room was blind and selfish, and the catastrophic results all too familiar in these courts,' he said. 'In my view, your actions were a complete over-reaction to Mr Duffy's aggressive and drunken behaviour. A life has been thrown away.' Addressing Boukhari, he said: 'You were the victim of an attack in the house and there was an element of both provocation and self-defence. 'But your reactive acts were totally disproportionate.' Duffy and Boukhari had been living with Green, an unemployed caretaker, shortly prior to the killing. The fight broke out in the lounge of a mutual friend, Daniel McNamara, who lived near them, shortly before 12.30pm on January 5 this year. Green stabbed Mr Duffy with a knife and Boukhari struck him on the back of the head with a hammer, fracturing his skull. A jury at the Old Bailey in Central London took just three hours to find Boukhari guilty of manslaughter and Green guilty of murder . Prosecutor Jonathan Rees QC said: 'Shortly before Mr Duffy was assaulted by these two defendants, he had gone to the address to confront Green and assaulted Nadia Boukhari. 'It appears one possibility is that he suspected there was something going on between them.' Green had told jurors at the Old Bailey that he was not in the house when the murder happened and he saw a badly injured Mr Duffy when went back to get his bus pass. However, they did not believe him and convicted him of murder. Boukhari, who emigrated to the UK from Morocco in 2008, claimed Green was the knife-man and had denied using the hammer. She then changed her story to say she had acted in self-defence. Boukhari was found guilty of manslaughter after hearing about the 'turbulent relationship' she had with Mr Duffy, who had been violent towards her on numerous occasions. Defence barrister Ann Cotcher QC said Boukhari had been assaulted repeatedly throughout her stormy two-year relationship with Mr Duffy, and had been punched twice in the face earlier on the day of the killing. 'Nadia Boukhari told the court she was generally assaulted three or four times a week,' she said. 'If she's even nearly right, that runs into tens, if not hundreds, of occasions. She added: 'For simply being refused a cigarette, he launched an attack on Ms Boukhari, the seriousness of which she had never experienced before. 'The attack continued for some time and almost immediately that it finished, she picked up a hammer. 'It was the extreme violence that made her use it. 'This was a strong man, said to be a boxer or bare-knuckle fighter, fighting a woman. 'The cumulative effect of being abused time after time after time may well have had some bearing on how she behaved on that occasion.'","Nadia Boukhari said the victim - a former boxer - had attacked her after she denied him a cigarette .

"By . Kirsty Walker . Last updated at 10:05 AM on 15th November 2011 . Shamed: Baroness Uddin could return to the House of Lords without repaying £125,000 in expenses . Shamed Labour peer Baroness Uddin will be allowed to return to her seat in the House of Lords, despite failing to repay a penny of the money she was fined for cheating on her expenses. Lady Uddin, the first female Muslim peer, was booted out of the Lords for 18 months and ordered to repay £125,000. Despite owning three properties with her husband, she claims she is now too poor to repay the money. It has emerged the Lords authorities are powerless to prevent Lady Uddin, whose suspension ends in April, from returning. A ruling by the committee for privileges and conduct in the Lords says that it would be illegal to make her return conditional on the repayment of the money. It has warned that such an arrangement would amount to a permanent ban and this would infringe her right as a peer to be called to the House by the Queen at the start of a parliament. Lady Uddin was exposed as a cheat in May 2009 after it was reported that she had never been seen at her designated ‘main home’ in Maidstone, Kent. The small flat allowed her to claim £174 a night while she was living at her family home in Wapping, East London, provided by a housing association. Lady Uddin has always denied wrongdoing, but an investigation by the Lords authorities found she had deliberately exploited the system to boost her income. The failure to prevent the peer returning to the Lords has angered her fellow peers. They fear that Lady Uddin wants to use her peers’ tax-free allowance of £300 a day to gradually pay back her debts. 'Main home': Baroness Uddin's property in Maidstone, Kent, which she listed as her primary residence. Neighbours said she was never seen there . If she attended the House of Lords . frequently, she could pay back all £125,000 in three years – meaning she . would end up repaying taxpayers with their own money. Liberal Democrat peer Lord Oakeshott . said: ‘It can’t be right to let a disgraced peer back before they have . repaid their bogus expenses. If you do not pay your fines, you go to . prison.’ His view is shared by a sub-committee . on Lords’ conduct which has warned that she should not be allowed to . come back until the money has been repaid. Fellow expenses cheats in the Lords . have either paid back the money or have vowed to do so before they . return. Lord Hanningfield has promised to pay back £30,000, while fellow . Conservative Lord Taylor of Warwick has paid back his full amount of . £24,000. Lady Uddin has declined to comment. When the scandal broke, she insisted that she had stayed regularly in the Kent home. The CPS said she would not face charges on the grounds it was ruled that a ‘main house’ might be visited only once a month.","Baroness Uddin owns three properties with her husband but says she is 'too poor' to repay money .

Mr Gallop, 37, said he was stunned when he spotted five lamps, costing £2,000 each, had been vandalised. As his house is covered by CCTV . cameras he reviewed the film and was shocked to discover footage of Mr . Willan peering over the wall ‘like a meerkat’. Video showed Mr Willan, dressed in a pinstripe suit, clambering over the adjoining wall clutching a long scaffolding pole. The senior law partner, who was . awarded an Italian knighthood and has a family seat in Turin, then . smashed the five Georgian lamps adorning Mr Gallop’s courtyard and . driveway. A furious Mr Gallop called police and Mr Willian, 56, a father-of-three, was arrested on suspicion of criminal damage. After being questioned he admitted the offence, expressed regret, and was issued with a caution. The incident was the culmination of a two-year feud between the pair who live in a leafy millionaire’s row in Bowdon, Cheshire. Boundary dispute: This image of Mr Willan's house was taken from Mr Gallop's house . Mr Gallop's home, where some of the damaged Georgian lamps are visible on the walls of the house . Two of the damaged lamps on Mr Gallop's property, which he says cost up to £2,000 each . They had earlier become locked in a . bitter boundary dispute which escalated after Mr Gallop chopped back the . branches of a sycamore which he said were overhanging his new property. Mr Gallop, the managing director of . Belmont Homes, said he was worried branches could snap during the winter . and damage his roof and also feared that falling leaves could block his . drains. But Mr Willan, a senior partner at . Linder Myers solicitors in Manchester, complained the tree surgeon had . trespassed on to his property to chop back some branches. Police were called in over the lights row last month. In a statement Mr Gallop said: ‘I . checked the CCTV and could not believe it. Mr Willan popped up like a . meerkat peering over the wall. Then fully-suited he dropped into my . courtyard and started smashing up the lights. 'My first instinct was to go round and confront him, but I thought the best thing to do was call the police.’ Yesterday Mr Willan, who is the . official solicitor to the Italian Consulate in Manchester, said the . incident was part of an on-going row. The pair are locked in a civil battle with both claiming compensation for damage caused to their properties. Neighbours say Mr Willan, who lists . his interests as shooting, real tennis and 20th century Japanese art, . has been left so distressed by the dispute he has put his £2million . house up for sale. The lawyer, whose mother was Italian, . is a descendant of an Italian count, ennobled for heroics on the . battlefield during the 16th century. The family seat is near Turin but, because the country is a republic, the title has little modern significance. A statement from his law firm said: . ‘Mr Willan has claims against Mr Gallop for trespass and criminal damage . on two separate occasions, the latter [being] the damage to certain . trees which caused the present incident. Mr Willan regrets and . apologises for the current incident and acknowledges responsibility.’ Linda Roberts of Heatons Solicitors, . representing Mr Gallop, said: ‘We are awaiting quotes for the damage Mr . Willan caused to my client’s property and will be seeking damages . accordingly.’","Catalyst was when Simon Gallop called in a tree surgeon to cut back overhanging branches of a sycamore growing in Paul Willan's garden .

Thomas Bashline, 42, who worked for the Harlem Globetrotters, was found dead by his girlfriend in Frederick, Colorado, two weeks ago. Initially police believed he may have been killed over drugs tests that he carries out on athletes across the U.S. Trotter: Bashline, centre, was a high school trainer for 10 years before being hired by the blue team of the Globetrotters three years ago . Thomas Bashline was found murdered in his bedroom after being shot in the head . However, that is not the case and . sources within the Weld County police department now say Bashline met . the suspect on the man-for-man personals section on the website. Officers believe that he had driven 15 miles to Longmont where he picked the man up before taking him back to his home. There it is believed the suspect shot Bashline in the head before stealing his Chevy S-10 truck which was found in 22 miles away in Boulder, Col. Officers also said that the man they have in custody is answering questions on an unrelated charge but evidence they found inside the stolen vehicle had linked him to the crime. His brother, Richard, has refused to speak about the latest turn of events, but soon after Thomas Bashline was killed he told Fox 31 Denver: 'It's not natural, it wasn't suicide. It was murder.' Bashline had been a high school trainer for 10 years before being hired by the blue team of the Globetrotters three years ago, according to the Denver Post. Murder: It is believed the suspect shot Bashline, right, in the head before stealing his Chevy S-10 truck which was found in 22 miles away in Boulder, Colorado . Initial reports suggested he had been murdered because of drugs tests he carried out, but that is now not thought to be the case . Jeff Munn, executive vice president of the club, said: 'We have just learned of the tragic loss of one of our trainers, Thomas Bashline. 'Our condolences go out to Tom's family and friends. The entire Harlem Globetrotters organisation is deeply saddened by this news.' Bashline was also a businessman, operating a company that administered drugs tests across the U.S. for baseball, basketball and football players.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 3:44 PM on 14th November 2011 . The Norwegian right-wing extremist who confessed to a bombing and shooting massacre that killed 77 people tried to give a speech describing him as a resistance leader at his first public court hearing today - but was cut off by the judge. Wearing a dark suit, Anders Behring Breivik was escorted by guards into an Oslo court room packed with dozens of reporters and members of the public. They included survivors and families of his victims who were able to see him face-to-face for the first time since the bloody rampage. Extremist: Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik is taken into an Oslo court in a police van today for the first open hearing of his case . Guises of a killer: Anders Behring Breivik in military uniform (left) which he had requested to wear at a previous court hearing and (right) in an image found in a manifesto attributed to the anti-Islam extremist earlier this year . Breivik began portraying himself as . the 'commander' of a Norwegian resistance movement and rejected the . court's authority to hear his case before the judge interrupted him and . told him to stick to the issue at hand. Speaking at a court just two blocks . from where he detonated a huge homemade bomb, he said: 'I am a military . commander in the Norwegian resistance movement and Knights Templar . Norway. 'Regarding the competence (of the court), I object to it because . you received your mandate from organisations that support hate ideology . (and) because it supports multiculturalism.' He acknowledged carrying out the . massacre, but refused to plead guilty to terror charges. He claims he is . in a state of war to protect Europe from being taken over by Muslim . immigrants. 'I acknowledge the acts but I do not plead guilty,' Breivik told the court. Breivik, speaking at a court picketed . by a group of protesters holding a banner that read 'No speakers' platform for fascists', attempted to address survivors and victims' relatives, but the court denied his request. Facing a killer: Survivors of Breivik's rampage wait nervously in the courthouse to see him for the first time since the attacks in July . Highly charged: Armed police stand guard at the courthouse in anticipation of the hearing as media, survivors and protestors mingle outside . Media storm: Journalists wait in line for a final security check in the Oslo courthouse before today's hearing . Speaking after the hearing, Bjoern . Ihle, 20, from Oslo, said: 'He aimed at me on Utoeya Island. That was . the last time I saw him. 'It is good to see he was powerless, . which he was not then. He looked nervous and weakened. It was a . different experience than when I saw him at Utoeya.' Most of the island victims were in . their teens or 20s and some were shot at point-blank range or while . trying to swim to safety. Daniel Vister, another survivor, said Breivik looked weak and his rant showed he was mentally ill. 'I think that what he said there shows that he is completely mad. He is definitely not on this planet. 'I didn't think he would look like that ... he was very big then and he now looked so flimsy,' he said. In a rambling manifesto posted on the . Internet before the attacks, Breivik wrote that his arrest would open . 'the propaganda phase' of his operation to ignite a war to defend Europe . against a supposed Muslim takeover. The world watches: Members of the press wait in room 828 of the courthouse before Breivik is led in for the hearing, but only after the photographers have left . The hearing, required under Norwegian . law to keep a suspect in prison before trial, was Breivik's fourth, and . as expected, the court decided to keep him in custody for a further 12 . weeks. He will likely remain in prison until he goes to trial, probably in the first half of next year. About 120 people were admitted to the . courtroom, while hundreds of others squeezed into overflow rooms . equipped with video links. Breivik has been kept in solitary . confinement since July 22 and has been denied visits, correspondence and . access to newspapers and television. The prosecution asked the court to ease those restrictions slightly on Monday, but the judge declined. At the end of today's hearing, however, the judge lifted a ban on reporting on the proceedings. Investigators say Breivik set off a . fertilizer bomb outside the government headquarters on July 22, killing . eight people, before heading to an island retreat, where youth sections . of Norway’s governing Labour Party were gathered for their annual summer . camp. Devastation: Smoke billows from a 17-storey government building after Breivik's bomb rocked central Oslo on July 22 killing eight people . Disturbing: Police and rescue groups recover some of the last remaining bodies from Utoeya Island after Breivik, posing as a police officer, shot dead 69 during a rampage at a youth camp . Disguised as a police officer, he opened fire on scores of panicked youth, shooting some of them as they fled into the lake. Sixty-nine people were killed on Utoeya island before Breivik surrendered to a police SWAT team. The carnage left Norway shocked and continues to haunt a nation that sees itself as peaceful and tolerant. An online manifesto attributed to . Breivik sheds light on his choice of targets. In it, he lays out a . blueprint for a multi-phase revolution, targeting left-leaning political . elites he accuses of destroying their own societies by admitting large . numbers of immigrants, especially from Muslim countries. His actions were widely condemned, including by the anti-Islamic bloggers and groups that he cited prolifically in the document. Oil-producing Norway, home to the . Nobel Peace Prize, is known for its open society and relative . prosperity, but the attacks sparked a public debate about immigration, . security and a legal system which never had to cope with such an event.","Right-wing extremist attempts to give speech, but was cut short by judge .

Pc David Rathband, 43, used Twitter to confirm he and his estranged wife Kath, 41, are set to divorce. Clearly heartbroken he wrote: ‘Sad to announce Mrs R has called time on our marriage separation permanent.’ Divorcing: Pc David Rathband is splitting from his wife Kath, 41, he revealed on Twitter yesterday . The couple separated at the end of August after police were called to their £300,000 home in Cramlington, Northumberland, following reports of a domestic incident. Pc Rathband was detained by colleagues from Northumbria Police on suspicion of assault after responding to a late-night call made by the couple’s son Ashley, 19. Killer: Raoul Moat shot Pc Rathband in the face while he was sat in his patrol car . Pc Rathband, a former traffic officer, was spoken to at the scene and officers gave the couple advice before leaving. The couple remained in contact with one another and appeared to be rebuilding their marriage. But just two days ago he wrote: ‘Life is a mystery. Who knows what is round the corner. Roll on Christmas.’ Pc Rathband miraculously survived after he was shot twice by Moat from close range as he sat in his traffic car at a roundabout in the West Denton area of Newcastle. He was left with more than 200 pellets lodged in his skull yet gave evidence at the trial of Moat’s two accomplices, Karl Ness and Qhuram Awan. Both were jailed. Wearing his uniform and holding a white stick, he told a court how he had seen the crazed killer approach his Volvo before two shots were fired through the passenger window. He was convinced he was going to die, he told the jury. Somehow he managed to radio for help and was rushed to hospital where he had emergency surgery. Since then he has launched his own charity, the Blue Lamp Foundation, to help emergency service personnel injured in the line of duty. He has also won bravery awards. In his autobiography, Tango 190, Pc Rathband paid tribute to his wife and children for supporting him in the months after the shooting in July last year. ‘I live for them now,’ he wrote. Moat, who shot and injured his former partner Sam Stobbart and killed her new boyfriend, Chris Brown, vowed to kill as many policemen as he could while on the run. He was finally cornered by armed officers in the Northumberland village of Rothbury where, after a six hour stand-off, he shot himself in the head with his double-barrelled shotgun. Following the news of Moat’s death Pc Rathband said he had enjoyed his first full night’s sleep for ages. He has since launched legal action against Northumbria Police, accusing the force of failing to do enough to protect him and fellow officers from the killer.",Pc David Rathband separated from his wife Kath following reports of a domestic incident in August .
"By . Rachel Quigley . Last updated at 4:52 PM on 15th November 2011 . The ex-girlfriend of convicted home-invasion killer Joshua Komisarjevsk said he called her a week after the brutal crime, bragging about the killings and showing 'no remorse in the slightest' for his actions. As evidence mounts in the penalty phase of his trial and the jury continue to deliberate on whether or not to give him the death penalty, Caroline Mesel revealed that Komisarjevsky even boasted about the ferocity in which he beat Dr William Petit. Miss Mesel told RadarOnline that the 31-year-old described the events that  led up to the deaths of Jennifer Hawke-Petit and her daughters Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11, on 23 July, 2007, with no trace of regret in his voice. Ex-girlfriend: Caroline Mesel said she doesn't care if Komisarjevsk lives or dies after bragging about the crimes to her in a phone call the week after . She said: 'He bragged about hitting Dr Petit. He said to me, ""You should have seen how big this guy was, I had to hit him a number of times"". 'I told him that was gross. He didn’t sound remorseful in the slightest.' No remorse: Joshua Komisarjevsky is said to have bragged to his girlfriend about how hard he beat up Dr Petit . The disturbing conversation took place just a week after the family was attacked and their upscle Cheshire  home was burned down. Miss Mesel was dating Komisarjevsky at the time but had moved to Arkansas with her family just weeks earlier. Throughout the trial, Komisarjevsky repeatedly blamed Steven Hayes for being the ringleader of the horrific crime, in which they broke into the Hawke-Petit home, held them captive for hours, eventually raping Mrs Hawke-Petit and her youngest daughter. They also tole $15,000. They then . strangled the mother before dousing the house with gasoline and setting . it ablaze with the daughters tied to their beds. Dr Petit was beaten with a baseball bat and tied up. By the time he managed to get free it was too late to save his family. Miss Mesel told RadarOnline Komisarjevsk blamed Hayes when he called her a week later, claiming he was the mastermind behind it all. 'He tried to blame it all on Hayes,' she said. 'Josh said he told him, ""You got yours, now I get mine"",' referring to the fact that Hayes raped Mrs Hawk Petit before strangling her. Victims: Dr William Petit Jr, . left, with his daughters Michaela, front, Hayley, centre rear, and his . wife, Jennifer Hawke-Petit . A mother's love: Joshua Komisarjevsky's mother . Jude cried recounting stories of her son, who was adopted as a baby . shortly after his 1981 birth . Komisarjevsky admitted to police that he molested 11-year-old Michaela while she was tied to her bed. Accomplice: Steven Hayes was convicted and is already on death row for the killings . In his disturbing taped confession, he said: 'One thing led to another and I ended up … performing oral sex on her. 'She had this look on her face that she understood, like you know that, yeah we were here, and we were invading her home and that she understood that we wouldn't hurt them and we'd just be on our way.' Both daughters died of smoke inhalation. Photographs of the scene shown to the jury revealed the eldest daughter had freed herself after being tied up and was apparently trying to save her younger sister when she was overcome by smoke. Her body was stretched out on the floor on the landing at the top of the stairs. Michaela's body was found tied to the bed, with her lower body draped on the floor. Miss Mesel said, now that all the gruesome details of the crime have come out and Komisarjevsky - who she calls her 'first love' - and Hayes have been convicted, she doesn't care if he lives or dies. 'I go back and forth about whether he gets life or death. I just want it to be over with,' she told Radar. 'I . was devastated (after it happened), I couldn't sleep for weeks and had . nightmares. I would sleep with my mom and cry constantly. I thought, . ""This can not be happening"". Scorched: The house was set alight with the girls still inside, tied up with pillowcases over their heads . Horror: An image shown to the court shows the charred bedroom of Hayley Petit after the attack . 'How do you do that to someone you don’t even know, to two girls who hadn't even lived their life? And to a mom...It was so shocking, I had no idea. Everything changes, your whole perception in life changes.' She said she has no interest getting any form of explanation or closure from him whether he gets the death penalty or sentenced to life in prison. She said: 'I won’t try to contact him. I don’t even care about talking to him, it would be a waste of my time hearing words out of his mouth.'","Caroline Mesel claims Joshua Komisarjevsk called her a week after saying: 'You should have seen how big this guy was, I had to hit him a number of times'

"By . Jack Doyle, Ben Todd and Kate Loveys . Last updated at 11:26 PM on 15th November 2011 . The adopted son of Pink Floyd guitarist David Gilmour was released from prison yesterday morning - four months after he was sentenced for violent disorder during the tuition fee protests. Charlie Gilmour, 21, walked out of HMP Wayland in Norfolk into the autumn sunshine with what appears to be a cigarette tucked behind his right ear before stepping into a chauffeur-driven Mercedes in which his father was sitting. The close crop of the rioter's hair was in marked contrast to the lengthy locks he sported when he swung from a Union flag on the Cenotaph during demonstrations in London last December. Charlie Gilmour, 21, steps out of prison today into the autumn sunshine after serving barely a quarter of his sentence for violent disorder during the London riots . On leaving the prison Gilmour, with what appears to be a cigarette tucked behind his right ear, stepped into the a chauffeur-driven Mercedes in which his father was sitting . The close crop of the rioter's hair was in marked contrast to the lengthy locks he sported when he swung from a Union flag on the Cenotaph during demonstrations in London last December . Gilmour was jailed after admitting violent disorder during the riots in London while high on LSD, Valium and whisky . He was jailed for 16 months in July after a judge said he had shown the 'ultimate disrespect' to Britain's war dead. His solicitor, Robert Brown, said: 'Charlie Gilmour was released from HMP . Wayland subject to him complying with a home detention curfew (HDC - . commonly known as tagging). 'The curfew will continue until the . halfway point of his 16-month sentence. This is standard procedure for . prisoners who are serving a sentence of between three months and four . years. 'Charlie Gilmour was sentenced to 16 . months' imprisonment on July 15, 2011, and his release today subject to . HDC is therefore in line with normal Home Office procedure.' Despite his conviction, Gilmour is likely to be allowed to complete his history degree next year, the Mail can reveal. Cambridge University authorities are . yet to make a formal decision on whether he should be disciplined, but . have indicated he is extremely unlikely to be expelled. Gilmour's release comes two days after Remembrance Sunday. Tory MP Patrick Mercer, a former Army colonel, criticised the decision to let him out. He said: ‘I thought Gilmour had been . given an exemplary sentence in order to discourage others. I find it odd . therefore that he is being released with barely a quarter of his . sentence served.’ Gilmour was jailed after admitting violent disorder during the riots in London while high on LSD, Valium and whisky. He joined a mob which ransacked . Topshop on Oxford Street, causing £50,000 of damage; attacked the convoy . carrying Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall to the Royal . Variety Performance; and was photographed swinging from a Union Flag on . the Cenotaph. At his trial he tried to excuse himself by claiming he did not know it was the Cenotaph. But Judge Nicholas Price said that . explanation ‘defied belief’ and described Gilmour’s behaviour as . ‘outrageous and deeply offensive’. Last month, Gilmour appealed against . his sentence, claiming  it was ‘unduly harsh’, but the case was rejected . by the Court of Appeal. Following his release he is likely to return to his family home in Billingshurst, West Sussex. Gilmour, pictured with his parents on his way to court, was originally sentenced to 16 months for his rampage through London . The family also have a £2.68million seafront mansion in Hove, East Sussex. Gilmour will wear the tag until he reaches the halfway point of his sentence, when he will be released on probation. His family are said to be ‘delighted’ he will be home for Christmas. A Prison Service spokesman said: ‘We do not comment on individual prisoners.’ A spokesman for Cambridge University . said Gilmour had been released from jail too late to start the third . year of his undergraduate history degree. He said: ‘There is no way that he . would be able to resume his studies this year but no decision has been . taken on whether he can next year.’ Gilmour’s college, Girton, will decide within a month if he can return in October next year to complete his degree. He could be fined up to £200, suspended or sent down, the Cambridge term for being expelled. A college spokesman said no students had been sent down in the past decade.","Charlie Gilmour, 21, sentenced for violent disorder during student protests .

Gabrielle Giffords and her family have revealed how the tragic shooting in January of this year healed the rift that had simmered between her and her two teenage stepdaughters. As Giffords struggled to form full sentences in at television interview last night, the Congressowman's stepdaughters Claudia and Claire told how the tragic afermath of the attack gave them a 'second chance' to bond with their father's new wife. The Diane Sawyer interview with Giffords and Mark Kelly was the congresswoman's first full interview since the January shootings that killed six people and wounded 13. Giffords said she would not be returning to congress until she is 'better. She struggled to respond to a question about whether she would return to Congress, saying 'No, Bette' before husband Mark Kelly finfished her sentence. Scroll down for video . Feeling 'pretty good': Gabrielle Giffords smiles during her first TV interview since being shot in the head ten months ago . 'She wants to get better' he said. Giffords . appeared alert and happy on the show, but admitted the rehabilitation . has been 'difficult' and that there is still a long way to go. The . 41-year-old is alert, curious and her intellectual skills are clearly . still there, but she spoke in halting sentences as she tried to get the . words out. Despite Giffords's struggle to summon the words, her speech therapist believes there is plenty more progress to be made. It was revealed in the programme that Mark Kelly's daughters Claudia and Claire were cold and indifferent towards Giffords after she married him in 2007. The girls admitted in the show that they regretted not being closer to the stepmother before the shooting. Kelly touched on the subject in the new book In their new book Gabby: A Story Of . Courage And Hope, writing: 'Gabby tried her best to connect with my . kids. They wouldn't be rude. They just weren't receptive.' When Giffords tried to engage them in conversation, they just shrugged and were even unresponsive when their new stepmother bought them gifts. Giffords eventually told her husband: 'I understand. They're kids and I love them. I'm patient. I'll wait for them to come around.' But the shooting changed everything. Kelly and his daughters were in Houston, where they lived full-time, when Giffords was holding her meet and greet event at a store in Tuscon, Arizona. When they heard of the shooting, they immediately flew to be by her bedside. The girls had never seen their father cry before. Change of heart: Mark Kelly with his daughters Claire (left) and Claudia who came to respect and love their stepmother Gabrielle . After two years of giving Giffords a hard time, Claudia, then 16, wrote: 'You are the strongest, most incredible woman I have ever met. 'I love you so much. I am thankful to have you in my life. 'I know we have not been extremely close in the past couple years and I am really sorry. That is going to change immediately.' From that moment, the girls did everything they could to show Giffords they loved her. Claudia said on tonight's show: 'I took Gabby for granted for so long, and I'm lucky I got a second chance to build a relationship with her.' In May, four months after she was shot, Giffords was well enough to leave her rehab center for a Mother's Day dinner with Kelly, his daughters, and Giffords' mother. She showed up at the restaurant with gifts for her own mother from her and Kelly. Just before the shooting: Gabrielle Giffords was meeting with constituents in Tucson, Arizona, when she was shot in the head . But she was also met with a pleasant surprise - Claudia and Claire joined them for dinner, showering Giffords with cards and gifts. It was a first for the girls and for Giffords and another turning point in their relationship. It may have taken a tragedy to bring Giffords and the girls together, but it made the girls realise how lucky they'd been to receive a second chance, Kelly writes. He said: 'We didn't fully know it, but we'd all been very lucky, and lucky to have each other. We see that clearly now.' In tonight's show Giffords said she will not return to Congress until she is 'better.' She struggled to form a sentence and replied, 'No. ... Better' when asked if she wanted to return to Congress. She moved her hands in front of her mouth as if needing to form the words and said, 'Better, better.' Her husband, former astronaut Mark Kelly, completed the thought for her, saying, 'She wants to get better.' The show also featured video documenting the 10 . months of progress since the . horrific Tucson shooting. The couple credits much of her recovery to music, as footage shot by her husband shows her singing such songs as Cyndi Lauper's Girls Just Wanna Have Fun and Free Falling by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers with hospital personnel.

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 7:58 PM on 15th November 2011 . Hero: Rachel Wheeler has raised more than $250,000 to help build new homes for the victims of the earthquake in Haiti . Rachel Wheeler has spent a large part of her life dedicated to the relief effort in the desperately poor Caribbean country of Haiti. Her tin-rattling, pledge-inducing exploits have raised an incredible $250,000 which has been spent on building 27 homes on the earthquake-torn island. All in all, not bad for a 12-year-old. The families in the village of Leogane were so delighted with their new homes, they have baptised the housing development 'Rachel’s Village'. But her dream has not stopped there. She now wants to rebuild the local school, which was severely damaged in the 7.2-magnitude earthquake which devastated the country in early 2010, killing 316,000 and leaving 3million homeless. 'Life is life,' she told msnbc.com. 'You can't expect to change Haiti overnight with the snap of the fingers. You have to work at it. You have to make it happen.' Three years ago, when she was just nine, the Florida youngster tagged along to a meeting about the charity work being carried out in Haiti by Food For The Poor. There, she met Robin Mahfood, the head of the aid agency, who described the famine, disease and homelessness affecting the children so badly. But just as her mother, Julie Wheeler, thought her daughter didn't understand what was being discussed, Rachel stood up on a chair in front of all the adults and pledged to build 12 homes. What a relief: Nine-year-old Rachel is surrounded by grateful Haitians in Leogane. The families were so pleased with their new homes they have named the development 'Rachel's Village' Humanitarian effort: Not content with just building homes, Rachel also delivers care packages to villagers on the earthquake-struck island . Rachel ran bake sales, passed the tin at homecoming games and sold homemade potholders at her Zion Lutheran School in Deerfield Beach, Florida, it was reported on msnbc.com. Through her Facebook page and by word-of-mouth, a cherry farm in Washington heard about Rachel and sent along the proceeds from one of its season's harvest. Another generous donation came from a family that regularly supports the overseas work of Food For The Poor. Rachel, who has been to Haiti twice to see the abject poverty first-hand, has more than doubled her promise. A family enters their new abode for the first time. Such was the alien environment of these houses, many of the residents had to be shown how to use a lock and key . Safe haven: Workers build the concrete, earthquake-proof homes in Leogane - 27 of which have been paid for with money raised by Rachel over the last three years . She spent $170,000 on brand-new earthquake-proof cement structures that shelter 27 families in Leogane, a small fishing village outside of the capital Port-au-Prince. Many of the residents had spent their whole lives in makeshift homes and tents - Food For The Poor needed to give them instructions on how to use a lock and key on their new abodes. Mr Mahfood said Haiti would be a 'completely different country' if everyone helped like Rachel had done. 'After nearly two years (since the earthquake), there is still so much great need. The children are experiencing an incredible amount of pressure. 'There aren't enough schools to go around and there is a lack of clean drinking water. People don't have the ability to look after their children properly or build their own home. There is so much unemployment it is unreal.' Teamwork: The youngster with Robin Mahfood, the head of aid agency Food For The Poor, whom she met at the meeting in Florida three years ago which encouraged her to help out . Determined: Rachel ran bake sales and encouraged businesses to donate money to make her promise a reality . Rachel has about half of the money needed to re-build the Reap de Morel school in Leogane, where 200 students learn in classrooms that have no walls, a patched tin roof and dirt floors. Classrooms are partitioned by bed sheets. The school 'library' is a simple wooden table displaying no more than 30 tattered books. Each child owns just a single pencil and notebook. Food For The Poor has worked in Haiti for 25 years. The charity runs hundreds of food pantries that feed more than 400,000 people daily and supports dozens of free health clinics. Many young Haitians suffer from deadly diseases such as cholera, which has killed more than 6,200 Haitians.

The WikiLeaks founder, who recently lost a High Court battle against removal, today lodged an application to take his fight against extradition to senior judges in London. The 40-year-old is facing sex crime allegations in Sweden. Legal battle: Julian Assange leaves the High Court on November 2 in London after failing in his bid to stop his extradition to Sweden to face sexual assault charges . Keeping a low profile: The WikiLeaks founder at the Occupy London demonstration, where he was stopped by trying to get through police lines wearing a black cape, hood and mask . It was confirmed today that he will be asking senior judges in London on December 5 to certify that his case raises a question of general public importance and should be considered by the highest court in the land. Two judges rejected claims that extraditing the Australian would be 'unfair and unlawful'. Allegations: Assange is accused of 'raping' one woman and 'sexually molesting and coercing' another . The Swedish authorities want Assange to answer accusations of 'raping' one woman and 'sexually molesting and coercing' another in Stockholm last August. Assange hit out after losing his High Court battle to block his extradition, saying: 'I have not been charged with any crime in any country. 'The European arrest warrant (EAW) is so restrictive that it prevents UK courts from considering the facts of a case, as judges have made clear here today.' He added: 'No doubt there will be many attempts made to try and spin these proceedings as they occur today but they are merely technical.' Today's legal developments follow reports that Assange has hired a Swedish public relations company - said to indicate that he was ready to abandon his appeal to the Supreme Court. The High Court upheld a ruling by District Judge Howard Riddle at Belmarsh Magistrates' Court, south London, in February that the computer expert should be extradited to face investigation. Assange, whose WikiLeaks website published a mass of leaked diplomatic cables that embarrassed several governments and international businesses, denies the allegations and says they are politically motivated.","Assange lodges application to take appeal to senior judges .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 10:58 AM on 15th November 2011 . Casey Anthony’s lawyers tried to persuade the 25-year-old to accept a plea deal towards the end of her murder trial, a retired prosecutor from the case has revealed in an explosive new book. Jeff Ashton said that while the Florida mother ‘may have deserved’ the death penalty if she had been convicted of killing her two-year-old daughter, he didn’t believe a jury would ever have agreed to the sentence. Writing in Imperfect Justice: Prosecuting Casey Anthony, he said he would have been pleased if the prosecution team had left the punishment off the table. Revelations: Prosecutor Jeff Ashton (left) says defence lawyers tried to make Casey Anthony (right) accept a plea deal in the closing stages of her murder trial . Insight: Mr Ashton hands evidence to a witness in Miss Anthony's trial on June 6. He has revealed previous behind-the-scenes revelations about the case in his new book . He also branded Miss Anthony’s attorney ‘smarmy’ and claimed he was genuinely careless with facts and encouraged his client to be uncooperative with detectives during the search for her daughter. Mr Ashton said: ‘Personally, I think I would have been happier if the death penalty had not been reintroduced into the case, even though I think on some level I think Casey may have deserved it. Simply put, I just didn’t think the jury would go there.’ Anthony’s refusal to accept a deal paid off as jurors acquitted her in July over the killing of her daughter, Caylee. She was released from prison, although she is in hiding somewhere in Florida, serving probation for an unrelated check fraud case. Mr Ashton’s book is the first account written by one of the key players in the trial that captured the attention of the nation last summer. He retired soon after the trial ended. Damning account: Mr Ashton's new book Imperfect Justice: Prosecuting Casey Anthony . In it, he takes direct aim at Anthony’s defense attorneys, specifically Jose Baez, whom he says he genuinely dislikes. ‘There is an unearned air of arrogance about the man that is incredibly frustrating to witness,’ Ashton writes. ‘The word I used in describing Jose is smarmy: somebody who is slick, underhanded and doesn’t shoot straight.’ Mr Baez said in a statement that Ashton’s characterisations were false. He said: ‘Having read several of the comments Mr Ashton makes in his new book, I am both surprised and somewhat disappointed he has chosen to attack me on a personal level.’ Mr Ashton also writes an unflattering view of jurors. He wrote they seemed to give a lot of thought and discussion about which movies they wanted to watch or which restaurants to go to while they were sequestered. Yet no juror asked a single question about the evidence during deliberation. ‘From the moment our jury had been fielded ... we’d had concerns over their apparent absence of strong opinions as well as over the amount of effort they seemed willing to expend on this,’ Ashton writes. ‘In retrospect, I think those concerns were justified.’ 'Smarmy': Mr Ashton says he genuinely dislikes Miss Anthony's defence attorney Jose Baez (left) who he claims encouraged his client to be unhelpful with police during the search for her daughter . Three jurors gave television interviews immediately after the verdict, but they have since refused to talk to reporters about the case. The book, for the first time, also discloses the results of two psychological evaluations taken of Anthony. Two defense psychologists who did the evaluations never testified. But Miss Anthony told the psychologists that she was sexually abused by her father, Ashton wrote. As part of their defense, Miss Anthony’s attorneys said Caylee drowned in the family swimming pool, and that her father, a former police officer, helped cover it up. Miss Anthony’s partying and shopping during the month before her daughter was reported missing was caused in part by her father’s sexual abuse, according to the defense theory. Grief: Miss Anthony's father George Anthony (pictured with wife Cindy) has always denied sexually abusing his daughter . Her father, George Anthony, repeatedly denied those claims in court and afterward. One psychologist expressed . apprehension about his evaluation being used to support that defense . theory, Ashton writes, especially since Miss Anthony had scored in a . normal range on a test designed to discover mental disorders. The . other psychologist gave Anthony a battery of tests to diagnose stress . from trauma such as sexual molestation. The tests didn’t support the . theory that she had been molested, Ashton writes. A . few weeks before trial, prosecutors met with Mr Anthony, and his wife, . Cindy, to give them a heads-up about the molestation accusations that . the defense planned to use at trial. ‘George . looked like he had been crying, like someone had just killed Caylee all . over again,’ Ashton writes. ‘He was just devastated.’ More . than six months after she disappeared, a meter reader found Caylee’s . remains in a swampy, wooded area near where she lived with her mother . and grandparents. Ashton said in the book that law . enforcement and volunteers never examined that area until Roy Kronk . reported seeing the remains there in December 2008. Tragedy: Miss Anthony's two-year-old daughter Caylee was found in woodland near her grandparents house six months after going missing in June 2008 . He writes: ‘In the end, Murphy’s Law prevailed: everyone assumed that someone else had searched there, but in fact no one actually had. ‘Everyone, including law enforcement, assumed that the most obvious place had to have been combed and given the all clear — which just proves the adage about what happens when you assume. 'Everybody ends up looking like and ass and a nation spent an extra four months searching around the country for a lost little girl who was a quarter mile from home.’ A spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff’s Office, the lead agency investigating Caylee’s disappearance and death, said Monday that pinpointing a place to search for the toddler was challenging. ‘Mr. Ashton, as part of the prosecution team, was well aware of the difficulties in establishing a starting point,’ Capt. Angelo Nieves said. ‘ . Casey Anthony told numerous lies to law enforcement throughout the investigation concerning her daughter’s whereabouts.’","Jeff Ashton attacks defence attorneys and jurors in new book .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 11:26 AM on 15th November 2011 . A Scotland Yard chief inspector has been sacked after boasting that he had sex with a 14-year-old boy, it was revealed today. John Duffy, 46, claimed online that he carried out the depraved sex act on a teenage stranger he met through a gay dating website. He also bragged that he had taken cocaine and used his position as a uniformed officer to try and seduce people online. Gross misconduct: John Duffy had been a chief inspector at Scotland Yard before he was sacked for the lurid online boasts . Duffy was caught out after a shocked user of the website reported  him to the police. He was arrested at his home in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, on suspicion of sexual assault in June last year. Last week it was revealed that a senior inspector from the Metropolitan Police had been sacked after an internal investigation. The officer was not named but he has now been revealed to be Duffy, the Sun reported today. Duffy was in charge of the scene at Stockwell Tube Station where Brazilian electrician John Charles de Menezes was wrongly shot dead by police in 2005. The 27-year-old had been suspected of being involved with the failed London bombings the day before. Last week it was revealed that Duffy had . used his position to advertise himself online in an attempt to meet . sexual partners while in uniform. He . was arrested at his home last year but a criminal investigation by . Kent Police was dropped because there was not thought to have been . enough evidence. Shooting: Duffy was in charge of the scene after the death of innocent suspect Jean Charles de Menezes at Stockwell tube station, pictured . Victim: Mr Menezes, a Brazilian electrician, was mistaken for a terrorist . However, the Met's Directorate of Professional Standards launched an internal investigation with supervision from the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Duffy was sacked last week after a two-day hearing in which he was found guilty of gross misconduct. 'There was no evidence he did have sex with a boy. It was all a fantasy, but an unhealthy one,' a source told the Sun. IPCC commissioner Mike Franklin said: 'Police officers, by virtue of the powers vested in them, hold positions of authority and trust in our communities. 'Those who discredit their role cannot expect to continue to serve the public and, as in this case, they should be dismissed.' Commander Peter Spindler, director of professional standards at the Met, said: 'Officers and staff may believe that what they do online, whether on duty or off-duty, is either anonymous or doesn't have any impact on others. 'This is not the case. The Metropolitan Police Service will pursue any allegations regarding improper online activity as vigorously as any wrongdoing offline. 'We expect our employees to behave professionally, morally, ethically and with the utmost humility and integrity in all areas of their lives. Anything short of this will not be tolerated.' A IPCC spokesman said: 'The breaches relate to claims made to members of the public on an interactive dating website that he was a serving police officer and that he had committed criminal offences including drug-taking and a sexual offence. 'He was also found to have used his position as a uniformed police officer to have advertised himself online in an attempt to meet sexual partners while in uniform.'","Senior officer named as 46-year-old John Duffy .

Police searching for missing toddler Sky Metalwala are investigating an online dating profile in his mother's name which was posted on a site advertised as 'a secure place for like-minded Sugar Daddies, Mommies and Sugar Babies to meet each other'. The owner of the site - Brandon Wade - said police contacted him on November 10 asking about Julia Biryukova's profile and asked him to turn over login information and any messages going in and out. Mr Wade said the page was created by someone using a Washington state Internet account, but because it was free there were no payment details or no real way to verify who it set it up. Scroll down for video . Suspicious: Investigators are frustrated that Sky's mother isn't willing to take polygraph or 'lie-detecting' test . Missing: Sky Metalwala, 2, was reported missing by his mother after she says she left him sleeping alone in her unlocked car for an hour after it ran out of gas . The website, which is called seekingarrangement.com, hails itself as a place for sugar daddies, mommies and babies to meet. Mr Wade said that Ms Biryukova - or . the person who created her account - signed up to be a 'sugar baby' which he said means 'she's looking for someone wealthy to take care of . her'. According to MNBC, on the profile - . which was created onJuly 25 - a person identifying herself only as 'JB' wrote she was 'looking for financial stability and assistance. I am . looking for a successful mentor. I am looking for a REAL man. 'YOU tell me YOUR ideal' arrangement!""', adding that she expected a monthly income of $3,001 - $5,000. The website features photographs . similar to those posted on her Facebook page and describes her as a . 30-year-old  'non-drinker, non-smoker', who can 'speak fluent Russian, . Ukrainian and English'. Abandoned: The street corner, shown, where the mother says she left her two-year-old, is a mile from where she says she walked to get gas . Hour's walk: A gas station shown is where the mother told investigators she walked with her daughter after she ran out of gas about a mile away, leaving her 2-year-old son alone in her car . The last time the account was accessed was October 26. sky went missing on November 6. The mother-of-two has so far refused a . police interview or polygraph test but police say there is no evidence . to charge anyone with a crime yet. Ms Biryukova is a native of Ukraine. She moved to the United States as a child and has spent most of her life . in Bellevue and the Eastside. Her two-year-old son Sky has been . missing for more than a week after she claimed she left him in the car . while she and her daughter went to get gas. But investigators have found that there . was enough gas in the car to run a considerable distance, Bellevue . police Maj Mike Johnson said last week. Washington police said they are keeping an eye on the mother-of-two in case she tries to leave the country. Brother and sister: Sky's older sister, Maile Metalwala (left), accompanied the mother to the gas station, leaving Sky alone in the car, according to their mom . 'We're not comfortable calling her a . person of interest or a suspect. So I suppose if she did intend to make . travel plans it would be something we'd want to know about and discuss . with her,' Maj Mike Johnson said today. Speaking about her flight risk, Maj Johnson said: 'It is something that's on our radar. We're watching for that.' he did not rule out that Ms Biryukova . may be trying to smuggle her son out of the country as he is currently . locked in a bitter custody battle with her husband Solomon. 'There's a lot of work going on to . rule out possible theories of abduction, coercion, the element of . custody battle between mom and dad, secreting him outside the country, . all of these are viable theories,' Maj Johnson told ABC. Custody battle: Sky's disappearance comes during a bitter divorce and custody fight between the mother and the boy's father Solomon Metalwala, seen holding Sky at an earlier time . He said Ms Biryukova's story has . become less and less plausible as police have tried and failed to find . any evidence that supports the facts as she presented them. He . emphasized, however, that she remains cooperative in other ways, . by answering every police question through her attorney, driving police . along the route she drove and then walked, and allowing complete access . to her home and car. In the week before Sky disappeared, . his parents reached a tentative agreement after a 12-hour mediation . session that would allow Solomen Metalwala to have some visitation with . the couple's two children. But two days later — and two days . before she reported her son missing — Biryukova decided to pull out of . the agreement, Metalwala's divorce attorney, D. Michael Tomkins, said . Wednesday. In a letter sent by her attorney, . Biryukova insisted that everyone at the mediation session had been . against her and the settlement was unfair, Tomkins said.

Visitation: The parents of Sky reached a tentative agreement that would allow the father to have some visitation with his two children, which the mother backed out of immediately before Sky's disappearance . The children didn't attend the marathon session, and it's possible they were left home alone for the entire time — raising the possibility that Sky could have become dehydrated, Tomkins said. Papers filed in the divorce say that Ms Biryukova suffered from 'severe' obsessive-compulsive disorder.

A mother died after she failed to receive an 'urgent' blood transfusion for two hours after giving birth, an inquest was told. Joanne Hatton lost two litres of blood as she gave birth to twins by Caesarean section at Darlington Memorial Hospital. But the hospital staff's failure to give the transfusion triggered a catalogue of errors as her condition worsened, the inquest at Newcastle Coroner's Court heard. Despite suffering kidney failure and liver problems after the birth, no one linked her deterioration with the blood loss, her husband, Julian, told the hearing. The 38-year-old legal adviser only got to spend one day with her newborn sons Ben and Miles before she became seriously ill. County Durham and Darlington NHS Foundation Trust has since accepted responsibility for the failings. Mr Hatton, 44, told Newcastle Coroners' Court doctors and midwives who were dealing with his wife did not communicate properly and that no one person was in charge of her care. He said the hospital had . underestimated his wife's blood loss after she haemorrhaged heavily . following the birth of her sons on December 30 2008. Dr Ahmed Ali, who has since retired, told . the hearing that he had called for an urgent blood transfusion but that . when he returned two hours later it had still not taken place.

'Again, it was like nobody linked her deterioration with her significant blood loss. Nobody appeared to be talking to each other. ‘There was a distinct lack of involvement from the maternity unit, which I found very strange at the time. On January 2, Mrs Hatton's family were told by a consultant that her kidneys had recovered and that she would be transferred back onto a general ward a few days later. However, doctors then became concerned about problems with her liver.  Mr Hatton received a phone call at 12.30am on January 4, telling him his wife was to be transferred to the Royal Victoria Infirmary, in Newcastle. After ten days of being brought in and out of sedation, Mrs Hatton died on January 20.

"By . Ted Thornhill . Last updated at 1:39 PM on 14th November 2011 . Three astronauts blasted off today for the International Space Station (ISS) as Russia seeks to restore confidence in its space programme following the recent crash of a cargo spaceship and several botched launches. The launch was the first since Nasa ended its 30-year shuttle programme in July, heralding a gap of several years when the 16 nations investing in the $100billion (£63billion) space station will rely solely on Russia to ferry crews. ‘The spaceship has reached orbit,’ Flight Engineer Anton Shkaplerov said in a radioed message to the cavernous Mission Control centre in a northern Moscow suburb. Up, up and away: Russia's Soyuz TMA-22 spacecraft with the International Space Station (ISS) Expedition 30 on board blasts off from the Russian-leased Kazakh Baikonur cosmodrome . Applause broke out as the crew flashed a thumbs-up signal to on-board cameras. The mission had been delayed since September over safety fears after an unmanned Russian Progress craft taking supplies to astronauts broke up in the atmosphere in August, one of the worst Russian space mishaps in decades. Veteran Nasa astronaut Daniel Burbank is making his first voyage on board a Soyuz spacecraft from Russia's Baikonur launchpad in Kazakhstan, while cosmonauts Shkaplerov and Anatoly Ivanishin are making their maiden space voyage. Ready and waiting: The Soyuz craft stands on the launch pad . The crew had shrugged off safety concerns before their craft lifted off from a snowbound Baikonur, blazing a bright orange trail through the overcast sky above the Kazakh steppe. ‘We don't have any black thoughts. We have faith in our equipment,’ Russian news agencies quoted Shkaplerov as saying before the launch. Reporting back to Mission Control after take off, he said the crew was ‘feeling good’. A small stuffed bird from the mobile app Angry Birds, a mascot given to Shkaplerov by his five-year-old daughter, hovered above the weightless crew. Ice one: The Soyuz rocket sits in the launch pad in freezing conditions prior to blast off, left. The arms eventually move away as the launch approaches, right . ‘Except for the bad weather in Baikonur, everything went extremely well,’ Vladimir Solovyov, head of launches for the Russian segment of the ISS, told reporters at Mission Control. After a cramped two-day journey aboard the Soyuz TMA-22 capsule, the crew will dock with the space station on November 16, overlapping briefly with station commander Mike Fossum of Nasa, Japan's Satoshi Furukawa and Russia's Sergei Volkov. Any problem in reaching the ISS could leave the space station empty for the first time in more than a decade when the current three-man crew returns to Earth later this month. Final frontier awaits: (from left) Russian cosmonaut Anton Shkaplerov, U.S. astronaut Dan Burbank and Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin, pose for photos prior to the launch . Russia's space agency chief has said the August 24 failure of the Progress rocket launch was an ‘isolated’ glitch caused by a fuel pipe blockage. But it added to a string of failures that marred this year's celebration of the 50 years since Yuri Gagarin's pioneering orbit and pointed to deeper troubles with Russia's space industry. Moscow hopes a smooth mission will begin to restore its reputation after more trouble this week when a launch touted as post-Soviet Russia's interplanetary debut went awry. Russia is likely to have lost the $165-million Phobos-Grunt probe, which is stuck in orbit and may drop to Earth after it failed to set a course toward Mars's moon on Wednesday. Botched launches have also lost Russia a high-tech military orbiter, a costly telecommunication satellite, and set back plans for a global navigation system to rival the U.S. GPS. While Nasa suffered the tragic loss of crews on its Columbia and Challenger shuttles in 2003 and 1986, Russia last suffered such an accident in 1971, when three cosmonauts died on their way back to Earth on the Soyuz-11 mission. This year the United States turned over all crewed flight responsibilities to Russia, at a cost of about $350million (£220million) a year, until commercial firms can offer space-taxi rides. Nasa is seeking $850million (£535million) to help U.S.-based private companies develop human orbital transport capabilities with the goal of breaking Russia's monopoly on ferrying astronauts to the space station before the end of 2016.","First manned launch since U.S. shuttle programme retired .

Gemma Whitby, 14, suffers from WAGR Syndrome - a disorder affecting fewer than 100 people worldwide. She was diagnosed shortly after birth, developing cataracts just after she was born and kidney cancer at the age of two. Gemma, 14, developed blindness and kidney cancer because of her rare condition. She is determined to become a DJ . However Gemma refuses to let her condition get her down. Her mother Fiona, 40, said: 'You just wouldn't believe the obstacles she has overcome. 'You read all the time about inspirational children, but she really is one.' The teenager from Bury, Greater Manchester, beat kidney cancer but her condition - which also made her blind - means she is much more likely to also develop ovarian cancer. Doctors expect this to happen at some point during puberty. Gemma is studying for her GCSEs at St Vincent's School for the Blind in Liverpool, and hopes to become a DJ. Her dream is to meet Radio 1 DJ Edith Bowman. Gemma was born at 41 weeks after a normal pregnancy, but her mother suspected something was wrong when her daughter had trouble breastfeeding. Doctors at the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital diagnosed WAGR Syndrome and at the age of two they found a cancerous tumour in her kidney. Ambition: Gemma hopes to meet Radio 1 Presenter Edith Bowman one day . The youngster had the organ removed but was dealt a further blow when she was diagnosed with chronic pancreatitis - meaning she has to have a controlled diet, with no chocolate or sugary drinks. Last December, she was hospitalised after eating Maltesers - and doctors warned her to avoid sweet foods or they could eventually kill her. Gemma is the only person to be treated for the condition at the children's hospital. Her consultant, Dr Indi Banerjee, said: 'It's a very rare condition. 'We have to keep a close eye on Gemma because there is a risk she could develop cancer. It's a horrible condition.' The condition is caused by a mutation . on chromosome 11, with several genes in this area deleted. It was first . described by scientists in 1964. Newborns with the condition have part . or all of the iris absent from their eyes and may have cataracts. Around half of sufferers develop Wilms tumours, which are tumours of the . kidneys.","But 'inspirational' Gemma doesn't let it get her down .

"By . Lucy Laing . Last updated at 12:20 PM on 12th November 2011 . Sisters Charlie-Marie and Emma-Jean Skinner have baffled doctors with their survival after they were both diagnosed with the rare tumours. Four-year-old Emma-Jean has two tumours in her heart and one in her brain, while Charlie-Marie, 15 months, has a tumour so big that doctors say they have never seen one that size before. Amazingly she is still alive and leads a normal life in Blackburn, Lancashire, because one of her heart chambers has grown bigger, to compensate for the size of the tumour. Hereditary condition: Emma-Jean (back) and Charlie-Marie (front) Skinner both suffer from Tuberous Sclerosis - a disorder which causes the tumours to grow . Their mother Heather, 27, who is studying to be a social worker, said she and her 51-year-old husband Andy were devastated when the girls were diagnosed with the hereditary condition Tuberous Sclerosis - a disorder which causes tumours to grow in the brain, nervous system, kidneys and heart. ‘Charlie-Marie was diagnosed before she was born after doctors spotted the tumour on the scan. They told us she wasn’t going to survive, so the fact she is still here is amazing. ‘Then a few months after she was diagnosed, Emma-Jean was tested too, and they found two tumours on her hearts. ‘But they don’t let it get them down. The doctors are amazed at them. They can run around and play just like their friends.’ Devastated parents: Heather Skinner, 27, and her husband Andy, 51, were devastated when their daughters were diagnosed . The devastating news was given to Mrs Skinner when she was 28 weeks pregnant. She went for a scan at hospital and doctors spotted a mass in the baby’s heart. She was referred to St Mary’s Hospital in Manchester and doctors told her that it was a tumour that was going to kill her unborn baby. Mrs Skinner, who is married to council worker Andy, said: ‘We were absolutely devastated. ‘They told me that I needed to terminate the baby as there was no way she would survive. The tumour was so big it was going to kill her. 'It was covering the whole left side of her heart and they said they had never seen one so big. ‘But we went home and I knew there was no way I could kill my baby. So we decided not to go ahead with the termination and instead we waited to see what would happen. Doting mother: Heather Skinner with Charlie-Marie, now 15 months, when she was a newborn, who was diagnosed with the tumour before she was born . ‘Every time she stopped moving I thought that was it, that we had lost her. 'We even bought her a blanket and a little outfit to bury her in. 'The midwife told us to get as many memories as we could, so we bought casting kits to take casts of her hands and feet when she was born to remember her by.’ Charlie-Marie was born by caesarian at Blackburn Royal Infirmary in January last year, weighing 6Ib5. Emma-Jean, four, has two tumours in her heart and one in her brain . The couple, who have four other children, twins James and Jessica, nine, Jennifer, eight, and Alfie, two, had her christened and she was taken down to special care. Mrs Skinner said: ‘The doctors didn’t think she had long left, so they wheeled me down to see her. But as the hours went by, she hung on. They couldn’t believe it.’ Charlie-Marie was still alive after four days, so the couple were allowed to take her home. When she was five-months-old she had tests which showed she was suffering from Tuberous Sclerosis. Mrs Skinner said: ‘We were devastated when Charlie-Marie was diagnosed. We were all tested as it is a hereditary condition. Andy has the condition too, although he has only ever had two lumps removed from his knee and arm and he wasn’t diagnosed at the time. ‘All the other children were fine, apart from Emma-Jean who has also been diagnosed with it. ‘Scans have shown that she has two tumours in her heart and one in her brain too.’ Family portrait: Heather and Andy with their childrend (from back left to right) James, Jennifer, Jessica (from front left to right) Alfie, Emma-Jean and Charlie-Marie . The couple are now taking one day at a time, as there is a possibility that if the tumours grow more they could put fatal pressure on organs, or they can turn cancerous. Mrs Skinner said: ‘They are both developing normally at the moment and the doctors can’t believe how well Charlie-Marie is doing as her tumour is so big. They expected her to have fits due to the size of it, but so far she is doing fine. ‘They are just normal little girls at the moment, which we are so grateful for. They have check-ups every six months and we don’t know what the future will bring for them both. ‘But at the moment no-one would know they both have tumours on their hearts. They are so full of life, they are our two little miracles.’","Charlie-Marie, 15 months, was diagnosed with the tumour before she was born .

"By . Graham Smith . Last updated at 3:00 PM on 4th October 2011 . Republican presidential candidate Michele Bachmann's White House bid has been thrown into doubt after a staff exodus, including her pollster and senior adviser, has led to questions about her campaign finances. Pollster Ed Goeas plans to leave the campaign after upcoming debates in New Hampshire and Nevada, and senior adviser Andy Parrish is returning to the Minnesota congresswoman's office where he served as chief of staff. The latest staff changes follow four previous resignations from Mrs Bachmann's campaign team. She is now trailing in seventh place in a new opinion poll of public support for Republican presidential candidates. Fall in support: Minnesota congresswoman Michelle Bachman, pictured campaigning in Virginia last week, has dropped to seventh place in a new poll of Republican presidential candidates . Maybe even more than the Republicans, President Barack Obama is looking forward to the GOP picking a candidate to challenge him. For now and months to come, Mr Obama is an incumbent with no specific rival, a campaigner against various forces but not one in particular. He is running against a staggering economy. And Congress. And himself - that history-making version of Mr Obama that many voters remember from 2008. The longer it takes for Republicans to rally around a nominee, the more the election remains a referendum on Mr Obama and jobs. That's not what the White House and his campaign eagerly want - a clear choice between the president and another candidate who holds starkly different views about how to improve the economy. With polls showing his approval rating in the low 40s, Mr Obama even contended yesterday that he's the underdog. 'I don't mind - I'm used to being an underdog,' the president said in an interview with ABC News. With no control over when he gets an opponent, Mr Obama is now waging what amounts to a proxy campaign against the eventual Republican nominee. Every time he presents his jobs bill as a choice between helping the middle-class or protecting the ultra-rich, every time he tells Democratic donors that his opponents' approach to governing 'will fundamentally cripple America', he is previewing a campaign argument that he will apply against whoever his opponent is. Republican insiders say their party's battle could extend into May - meaning Mr Obama would not have a specific challenger for more than seven months. Alice Stewart, a Bachmann spokeswoman, . said: 'Given the changing caucus and primary schedule, we will not be . utilising full-time polling consultants and will concentrate heavily on . retail politics in Iowa. 'Ed will work on several projects with us this month, then we shift focus to Iowa and he will shift to other projects not associated with the campaign.' Mr Parrish's return to Minnesota follows a move to Iowa last summer to build support before the state's lead-off 2012 caucuses. The moves signal an effort to preserve money three months ahead of the first Republican nominating contests. Mrs Bachmann began July with about $3.6million (£2.3million), most of which had been transferred from her congressional campaign account. She has struggled to match her vast reach among small-dollar givers with cheques near the $2,500 maximum donation. An update on her campaign's financial health is due by October 15. In other staff changes, deputy press . secretary Doug Sachtleben transferred back to the congressional office . after only a couple months with the campaign. So has Mrs Bachmann's . scheduler, Kimberley Rubin. In . a statement released last night, Ms Stewart said the moves were part of . a long-standing strategy to 'shift people and resources as needed'. She . said: 'We are adding staff in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina to . meet the demands of the changing caucus and primary schedule. 'With Congress back in session, we have shifted some employees back to the congressional office to meet the demands there.' Only last month, Mrs Bachmann's campaign manager Ed Rollins and his deputy stepped down. Mr . Rollins cited health reasons and deputy David Polyansky attributed his . departure to differences over the campaign's direction. Their exit came . within weeks of the candidate's Iowa GOP straw poll victory. After a strong start, numerous gaffes that earned her comparisons with that other hard-right conservative, Sarah Palin, Mrs Bachmann's standing in the race is starting to suffer. She now stands as the seventh most popular Republican candidate. A fall in support was first noticeable when Texas Governor Rick Perry announced his candidacy. She . fell further in opinion polls after suggesting an unproven link between . vaccines and mental retardation while trying to criticise Governor . Perry's executive order requiring young girls to get immunised for the . human papillomavirus, a sexually spread virus that can cause cervical . cancer. Former Massachusetts governor .

"By . James Chapman . Last updated at 12:25 AM on 15th November 2011 . Secret stockpiles of chemical weapons have been found in Libya – revealing Colonel Gaddafi duped Tony Blair when he promised to give them up. David Cameron said last night that the new Libyan government had told him it had identified an arsenal that had been ‘kept hidden from the world’. Diplomatic sources said several sites thought to contain mustard gas agent and other chemicals had been discovered across the country and were now under armed guard. Cosying up: Tony Blair with Colonel Gaddafi in 2007. The pair forged close links . If confirmed by international inspectors, the discovery will mean that Britain was mistaken when it cosied up to the Libyan regime on the understanding that it had given up its weapons of mass destruction. Closer ties between the countries were agreed when Mr Blair shook hands with Gaddafi in a tent outside Tripoli in the ‘deal in the desert’ in 2004. Mr Blair insisted at the weekend that he was not embarrassed to have forged links with Gaddafi. He said: ‘We were used to him being a threat, sponsoring terrorism. He was developing a nuclear and chemical programme. He gave it all up.' But last night Mr Cameron, at the annual Lord Mayor’s Banquet in London, said: ‘Although Gaddafi agreed to declare and dismantle all his weapons of mass destruction… in the last few days, we have learned that the new Libyan authorities have found chemical weapons that were kept hidden from the world.’ Stockpile: A part of Gaddafi's arsenal discovered in Tripoli. The former Libyan leader had been 'lying to the world' Broken promises: When Libya joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2004, it was obliged to declare all its chemical warfare materials and destroy them . This has prompted serious security . concerns given the political instability in Libya following Gaddafi’s . downfall. Britain is thought to be observing the sites closely using . satellite technology. A source said: ‘It seems Gaddafi had . been lying to the world about what he had and what he was doing with it. This is stuff that Gaddafi did not declare. ‘We are still waiting for confirmation about exactly what it is, but Gaddafi’s interest was in mustard gas. What we have said to the NTC [Libya’s National Transitional Council] is that it is critically important that this material is not moved, and that it is kept secure.’ When Libya joined the Chemical Weapons Convention in 2004, it was obliged to declare all its chemical warfare materials and destroy them by internationally agreed deadlines. Hidden: David Cameron said the new Libyan government had found an arsenal . Gaddafi declared 25 tonnes of bulk . mustard agent and 1,400 tonnes of ‘precursor chemicals’ which are used . to make chemical weapons. He also declared more than 3,500 unfilled . aerial bombs designed for use with chemical warfare agents such as . sulphur mustard, and three chemical weapons production facilities. By . February this year, Libya said it had destroyed 55 per cent of its . declared stockpile of sulphur mustard. The Organisation for the . Prohibition of Chemical Weapons has already deployed an inspection team . to Libya to evaluate the status of chemical weapons stored at the . Ruwagha depot in the south-east of the country. But the new Libyan authorities have advised the OPCW that ‘further stocks’ have been found. A spokesman for the OPCW said: ‘In accordance with the Convention, Libya will provide the OPCW with a new declaration in the very near future. The OPCW will continue to work with the Libyan authorities to verify and destroy any newly declared stocks.’ In last night’s speech, Mr Cameron rounded on critics who suggested Britain’s mission in Libya would ‘only end in failure’. ‘Some said we couldn’t win because they said Britain didn’t have the military might any more,’ he said. ‘Well, to those who predicted failure, look at what we have achieved. ‘We saved civilian lives as Gaddafi’s tanks bore down on Benghazi. We helped the Libyan people to liberate themselves. I would argue that our action helped keep the Arab Spring alive. Some will look at Libya and ask “is this a new British doctrine for intervention? Next time, will we just charge in regardless?” ‘My answer is “no.” Look at the reasons for the success of the Libya campaign. We set limited goals and stuck to them. We worked with allies. We had the support of the people.’","New Libyan government finds arsenal 'hidden from the world'

"Gustavo Villoldo's wealthy father forced to kill himself to save his sons by anti-capitalist Cuban regime in 1959 . He avenged father's death by helping to capture Che Guevara - and was tasked with secretly burying him . By . Chris Parsons . Last updated at 7:25 PM on 25th August 2011 . A Cuban exile whose family were persecuted by Fidel Castro's regime has been awarded $2.8billion damages after his father was forced to commit suicide at the height of the 1959 Communist revolution. Gustavo Villoldo's father was told by Castro's key lieutenant Che Guevara to take his own life and return his wealthy family's fortune to the state or his two young sons would be executed. Now over 50 years since Mr Villoldo's tormented father killed himself at Castro's request, his son - who later avenged his father by helping to capture Guevara  - has been given the payout after a landmark court ruling. Payout: Gustavo Villoldo, who was part of the team who killed Che Guevara (pictured in book), has been awarded $2.8bn damages following his father's forced suicide during the Communist revolution in 1959 . A judge in Florida ordered the Cuban government to pay damages to Mr Villoldo, 72, after his father - who had the same name - was given the ultimatum to take his own life in order to save his sons. Despite being the biggest ruling of its kind, however, Mr Villoldo will have huge difficulty obtaining any of the payout money, as Cuba does not recognise U.S. court rulings and has only $200million of seized assets in America, which are being claimed by other exiles. Gustavo Villoldo Sr, the wealthy owner of a law firm and General Motors plant worth $15million a year, was targeted by Fidel Castro's anti-capitalist agenda as soon as the Cuban revolutionary toppled President Fulgencio Batista in 1959. The family's home was stormed, Mr Villoldo Sr was imprisoned and interrogated and his family captured before he was given the suicide ultimatum in February the same year. Regime: Mr Villoldo's family were targeted during the Cuban revolution by Prime Minister Fidel Castro, right, and his key lieutenant Che Guevara, left . After his father's death, Gustavo . Villoldo Jr fled Cuba and moved to the U.S. after continued . persecution of his family and his late father's car business by Castro's . regime. Mr Villoldo . joined an anti-communist Cuban exile group and after joining the army . took part in the failed 1961 CIA-led Bay of Pigs invasion to topple . Castro. He later worked with the CIA, and was . part of the team that tracked down Guevara in the Bolivian jungle . eight years after his father's death in October 1967. Two years ago a different judge awarded Gustavo Villoldo more than $1billion in damages for the death of his father. Cuba’s . government has flatly refused to pay similar damage awards in the past, . leaving lawyers scrambling to find assets linked to Havana around the . world they can attempt to seize. Ernersto 'Che' Guevara was born in Argentina in 1928. He studied medicine but during a trip through Latin America when he was 23 he became politicised by the poverty he witnessed. Guevara became involved in Guatemalan social reforms until the American CIA overthrew the President Jacobo Arbenz. The rebel later met Fidel Castro and brother Raul in Mexico City and sailed to Cuba in 1956 to fight successfully against Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. Guevara worked within Cuba following the revolution and oversaw a national literacy campaign and redistribution of wealth. He was captured by U.S.-backed forces and executed on Oct 9 1967 . In her ruling this week, Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Beatrice Butchko found that Cuba's actions 'rose to such a level of depravity' that they amounted to torture and that Cuba must pay billions of dollars in damages. Judge Butchko wrote that Mr Villoldo Sr was 'told repeatedly that he, his sons, and his wife would be killed, unless he acquiesced to the turnover of his property and took his own life'. Mr Villoldo Jr's attorney, Andrew Hall, said he will attempt to collect by tapping frozen Cuban assets in the U.S. and Cuban-linked businesses around the world. Mr Hall told The Times: 'He's . ecstatic at the court ruling, but he's been through an awful lot... one . of his primary motives in bringing this case was to avenge his father's . death. 'His life has been the biggest rollercoaster in the world. 'Imagine . a leader of a nation that knows you personally, curses your name and . wishes you ill, wishes you an unpleasant death, and has attempted to . assassinate you periodically over a period of decades, then you will . understand what Mr Villoldo has endured.' U.S. courts have issued a number of similar judgments against Cuba over killings, imprisonment and confiscation of property. Some . people have collected sizeable amounts by going after bank accounts and . similar assets, but others have managed to find very little. Fidel Castro, 85, handed the Cuban presidency to his brother Raul in 2006 after 49 years in power. After fleeing Cuba, Mr Villoldo later joined an anti-communist rebel force on the failed CIA-led mission to topple Fidel Castro, seen here at the Bay of Pigs in 1961 .","Gustavo Villoldo's wealthy father forced to kill himself to save his sons by anti-capitalist Cuban regime in 1959 .

"By . Bruce Jones . Last updated at 2:38 AM on 15th November 2011 . Sam Ellicott’s life changed last year, on November 9, when he turned on his car radio. ‘A specialist was on talking about aneurysms,’ recalls the 73-year-old grandfather. ‘I’d never heard of them before but he described them as a swelling in an artery that can cause fatal blood loss. Lucky to be alive: Sam Ellicott had a dangerously large aneurysm . ‘I wasn’t listening too intently at first. But then he said men aged 65 and over could be at risk — and that you wouldn’t know you had one as there were no symptoms'. The presenter gave out a contact number for the local NHS aneurysm screening programme. Sam scribbled it on the back of his hand at the next set of traffic lights and called later that day. The retired NHS administrator, from Lichfield, Staffordshire, was booked to have an ultrasound scan in hospital the following Monday. ‘I just lay down on a couch and lifted my shirt, and they rubbed some jelly on my tummy. It only took about 15 minutes in all and they gave me the results immediately,’ says Sam. It was bad news. He was told he had a large aortic aneurysm. That meant a section of his aorta — the largest artery in the body, which carries blood from the heart down to the bowel, liver, kidneys and legs — was weak and bulging, and could rupture at any time. Aneurysms can occur anywhere in the body, but the aorta is most prone to the problem. Sam had been diagnosed with an abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) — Britain’s fourth biggest killer in men over 65, after cancer, heart attacks and stroke. Killer: It is estimated that 6,000 people die from aneurysms every year . An estimated 6,000 people — mostly men — die from them every year. Frighteningly, the condition often has no symptoms. ‘There’s usually no warning,’ says Jonothan Earnshaw, consultant vascular surgeon at the Gloucestershire Royal Hospital, and director of the NHS screening programme. ‘Generally speaking, you don’t know you’ve got one until it bursts. Most people die from a loss of blood. You can be perfectly well one day and dead the next'. An abdominal aortic aneurysm may develop when the aorta wall loses its elasticity, he adds. ‘The aorta wall can stretch with age. That means the aorta can develop a bulge — an aneurysm. It usually takes a few years for the aneurysm to grow, but once the bulge is more than 5.5cm wide there’s a significant risk of it bursting'. Although some aneurysms will never swell to that red alert of 5.5cm, about 50 per cent of people with the condition will eventually need treatment. Sam Ellicott’s aneurysm was 6.5cm when he went in for his scan. Four weeks later, surgeons at Heartlands Hospital, in Birmingham, carried out the life-saving operation. The swollen section of his aorta was cut open and replaced with a synthetic tube. Tissue from the artery was then wrapped round the new tube and stitched into place. ‘I had to take it extremely carefully at first after the operation,’ says Sam. ‘But in a few months, I was completely back to normal'. Not all aneurysm operations involve major surgery such as Sam’s. Sometimes the condition can be treated with keyhole surgery to insert a stent — a man-made narrow tube — inside the aneurysm itself, which reduces pressure on the artery. High cholesterol, smoking and being overweight can all contribute to developing an aneurysm, as they all encourage fatty deposits in arteries. These deposits cause inflammation, which makes artery walls lose their elasticity and bulge as a result. The NHS is running a screening programme to cut deaths from abdominal aortic aneurysms. Already available in 40 per cent of England, it started to roll out to the rest of the country last month. All men in screening areas will receive a letter inviting them for a scan when they turn 65. Scotland also has a programme. Wales and Northern Ireland plan to start theirs from 2012. ‘Many of the men we see will have nothing to worry about,’ says Jonothan Earnshaw. ‘But we’ve found 130 men with a large aneurysm in the first two years of the programme. ‘Any of those could have burst and killed them'. Sam is well aware this could have been his fate: ‘If I hadn’t been listening to the radio that day last November, there’s a real chance I might not have been here today. I really do feel incredibly lucky'.","An estimated 6,000 people - mostly men - die from aneurysms every year .

"By . Rebecca English . Last updated at 7:54 AM on 16th November 2011 . Perhaps she just wanted to take her mind off her split from long-term boyfriend Alex Loudon. For just days after her newly-single status first leaked out, Pippa Middleton was enjoying a weekend-long shoot at the stately pile of her close friend, George Percy, the Mail Online understands. Accompanied by a small group of friends, the Duchess of Cambridge’s vivacious younger sister spent three days taking pot-shots at grouse on his family estate in the Borders. Over the summer, Pippa Middleton and George Percy were seen at endless social events, including the Queen’s Club championships in June . George's parents Ralph and Jane at their home, Northumberland’s Alnwick Castle, which features as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films . George – or to give him his proper . title, Earl Percy, son of the 12th Duke of Northumberland – also invited . Pippa, 27, to join his family at a Remembrance Sunday service held at . Roman Catholic St Paul's Church in the nearby village of Alnwick. She . took a place in the front pew along with his parents, the Duke and . Duchess of Northumberland, and grandmother, Dowager Duchess of . Northumberland, Duchess Elizabeth. George, 27, sat in the row behind. The . Rev David Archer, who led the service, admitted he had noticed a rather . ‘attractive’ lady in the front row but had no idea it was the future . king’s sister-in-law. The pair have been confidantes since they shared a flat at Edinburgh University . ‘I . had noticed an attractive lady in the front row, but I did not realise . it was her. She did look like Pippa Middleton,’ he said. St Paul's new priest, Father Phil . Carroll, had welcomed the group into the church but also failed to . notice Pippa and remarked: ‘That shows how much we know about what is . going on.’ But an unnamed worshipper said: ‘It caused a bit of a stir in the church.’ According to friends, George was one of the few men who made Pippa’s beau a little green around the gills. Royal sources say that while Pippa’s . friendship with the heir to one of the richest and grandest dukedoms in . the land wasn’t the reason for their split, Alex never felt entirely . comfortable with the closeness of their relationship. The . pair have been confidantes since they shared a flat at Edinburgh . University along with Ted Innes Ker, son of the Duke of Roxburghe. Over the summer the couple were seen at endless social events, including the Queen’s Club championships. The night before the tennis Pippa and George were also seen enjoying a . three-hour dinner together in a French restaurant near Sloane Square . before returning to his London flat where she was eventually seen . leaving at 2am. Bizarrely, George shares a flat with another of Pippa’s . ex’s, JJ Jardine-Paterson. There . was also a long weekend in Madrid with a gaggle of girlfriends shortly . after the royal wedding in May, where the affable aristocrat . was seen squiring Pippa out to several of the city’s hottest nightspots . as rowing her around a boating lake. Old Etonian Alex, a contemporary of Prince William at the upper-crust school, is no slacker in the family stakes. His father, James, is a successful financier and former High Sheriff of Kent while his grandfather, Francis, married Lady Prudence Jellicoe, daughter of Admiral Sir John Henry Rushworth Jellicoe, who commanded the Royal Navy’s Grand Fleet at the Battle of Jutland in the First World War and became the second Governor-General of New Zealand. Olantigh, his family’s Kent estate, is an eminently respectable country retreat with more than 20 acres of farmland. But it cannot even begin to compare with the Northumberland’s Alnwick Castle, which features as Hogwarts in the Harry Potter films. The castle is known as as the ‘Windsor of the North’ and George’s family are regarded locally in Border country as royalty. The family’s wealth is conservatively put at around £300million and includes more than 100,000 acres of land as well as an estate in Surrey and Syon Park in London. A bright, well-mannered and well-meaning young man, George, who studied geography at university specialising in renewable energy, also recently set up in business and is poised to drill the first commercial geothermal well in Country Durham. Ex-boyfriend Alex found Pippa’s association with the Percy family ‘claustrophobic’ His parents, Ralph, the 12th Duke of Northumberland, and gardening-obsessive mother Jane are sensible sorts and withheld the bulk of his inheritance to prevent him going off the rails. The couple are on ‘kissing terms’ with most members of the royal family (including the Queen) and they and their four children were all invited to prince William’s April wedding. For her part Pippa was said to be ‘supremely at home’ when she attended the wedding of their eldest, daughter, Lady Katie at Alnwick In February.Little wonder that Alex found Pippa’s association with the family a little ‘claustrophobic’, according to one well-placed source. Last week The Sun reported they had finally spilt after 18 months together – just weeks after Pippa was given the keys to Alex’s Fulham home.. According to the newspaper, Pippa and Alex, a former professional cricketer who works as a financial analyst at brewing giant SAB Miller in Woking, are now ‘barely speaking’. ‘She and Alex split briefly in the summer – but this time it’s over,’ a source said. The paper claimed that Alex, who is intensely private, felt uncomfortable with Pippa’s new found celebrity. Friends have always expressed surprise at the relationship – ‘Alex is very nice and steady and all that but he’s just, well, a bit boring – particularly compared to Pippa who is hugely outgoing,’ one told the Mail only last month. Friends say her next beau would need to be ‘seriously sporty and well off’. ‘And it wouldn’t hurt for them to have even a moderately respectable country pile,’ said one. Perhaps the Middletons might yet boast double duchesses in the family?","The .

"By . Daniel Martin . Last updated at 4:09 PM on 16th November 2011 . Questioned: The £195,000-per-year Care Quality Commission boss Cynthia Bower . Ministers have launched an inquiry into the watchdog which regulates hospitals and care homes over concerns that its failings have put patients at risk. Officials from the Department of Health took action because of fears that the Care Quality Commission was failing in its responsibility to carry out the inspections that can root out poor care. It follows growing criticism of the quango which failed to notice abuse of residents at the Winterbourne View care home in Bristol for people with learning disabilities and took action only after undercover filming by the BBC’s Panorama programme. Last week, the Department of Health’s permanent secretary Una O’Brien called in CQC chief executive Cynthia Bower for questioning over the organisation’s perceived failings. A team of officials from the department also visited the quango’s headquarters to investigate its operations. Miss Bower is paid £195,000 a year and has one of the largest taxpayer-funded pension pots in the public sector. Before taking up her post at the CQC she was head of the NHS West Midlands health authority. Her job there included supervising the performance of Stafford Hospital, where hundreds of patients died needlessly in the A&E department. The CQC, which was set up by Labour in 2009, is already under investigation by the National Audit Office and the Commons public accounts committee amid growing concerns that the body is not fit for purpose to oversee 20,000 hospitals, care homes and clinics. Two months ago the health select committee of MPs lambasted the CQC for neglecting its duty of scrutinising patient care in favour of tick-box ‘registration’ of care providers. 'Unforgivable': The CQC admitted a lapse of judgment over care of patients at Winterbourne View, pictured. It has now emerged it actually reduced inspections but claimed it had doubled them . It emerged yesterday that in 2010/11, the CQC carried out only 7,368 inspections and reviews – despite telling Parliament in its annual report that the total was 15,220. The organisation has also cut down on the number of investigations it carries out into care scandals. Over the last year it carried out just one – into Winterbourne View – compared to the 16 that the Healthcare Commission, the CQC’s predecessor, carried out in five years. Miss Bower disbanded the CQC’s investigations team soon after taking up her post – even though NHS bosses told her that failure to publicise examples of poor care could encourage complacency. There has been a staff exodus at the organisation, following claims by employees of a culture of bullying. This has made it harder for the CQC to carry out inspections. The National Care Association, which represents care home providers, has warned of the risk of a ‘complete loss of confidence in the regulator throughout the sector’. It told the health select committee: ‘Our members pay large amounts of money to be regulated and expect in return to be the subject of robust inspection and a critical friend relationship. ‘The reality is that now more than ever there is very limited inspection; just a paper chase.’ A Department of Health spokesman said: ‘It is essential that the CQC is performing to the highest possible standards. ‘We are currently carrying out a review to ensure that it is doing the best it can to protect patients. ‘The findings of the review will be made public in the New Year.’ A spokesman for the CQC said: ‘The review has been openly discussed with CQC stakeholders and staff, and we have found it an extremely helpful process.’ The CQC said the review was in no sense out of the ordinary, as all health quangos were undergoing a ‘capacity and performance review’. It has been announced in September. Yesterday, health secretary Andrew Lansley told Health Service Journal magazine that the review did not reflect a lack of confidence in the leadership of the CQC – and said it was now running a ‘proactive and tough’ inspection regime.","Quango missed abuse at Winterbourne View care home exposed in BBC Panorama undercover programme .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 4:58 PM on 15th November 2011 . Positive press : The troubled UK Border Agency has been accused of manipulating drug seizure figures . The Home Office has been accused of manipulating drug seizure figures to show the troubled UK Border Agency in a ‘good light’. Bosses decided to release a select six month figure to the press a week before official statistics were due to be released showing the UKBA has actually seized less drugs this year than last. The chairman of the UK Statistics Authority Sir Michael Scholar said today the releasing of six month period figures to select journalists was 'irregular and inconsistent' with the code of practice. Figures released last Monday, showed border officials seized more cocaine and almost double the amount of heroin in the last six months than in the whole of the previous year. But days later, the official Home Office Statistical Bulletin showed the amount of cocaine seized by border officials in England and Wales had actually fallen by a quarter in 2010/11 compared with 2009/10, and the amount of heroin seized had halved. Sir Scholar has written to Home Office Minister Damian Green seeking reassurances the move was not 'to generate positive news coverage ahead of the release of the national statistics which showed a decline in the volume of drug seizures' were unfounded. In his letter to Mr Green, Sir Michael wrote: 'The Statistical Bulletin makes reference to a fall in the volume of seizures of Class A drugs in the most recent period. 'This contrasts with the November 4 press release, which highlights a large increase in seizures, albeit for a different time period. Seizure: Official figures show the UKBA took less drugs off people at borders this year than last . 'The November 4 press release, which appears not to have been published on either the Home Office or the UK Border Agency websites, and seems to have been distributed only to a select group of journalists, makes no reference to the forthcoming Statistical Bulletin. He went on: 'It has been suggested to me that one motivation for this release was to generate positive news coverage ahead of the release of the National Statistics which showed a decline in the volume of drug seizures. 'I would welcome your reassurance that this is not the case. Were it to be the case, the authority's view is that this would be highly corrosive and damaging to public confidence in official statistics.' Sir Michael added that, while the UK Statistics Authority backs the publication of important statistics as soon as they are ready, 'we believe that the right way to do this is to bring forward publication of the official statistics to the earliest date possible'. UKBA chief executive Rob Whiteman, who will be quizzed by MPs today over his role in the ongoing border checks row, welcomed the initial figures, saying: 'Our work to secure the border all day, every day continues to show significant results despite the efforts of organised crime gangs to circumvent our controls.'","Home Office released figures for a select six months just days before official stats showed less drugs were seized than last year .

"By . Michael Seamark and Colin Fernandez . Last updated at 11:40 AM on 16th November 2011 . News International made an abject apology for ‘shameful’ phone hacking by the News of the World at the public inquiry into Press standards yesterday. A lawyer for the company said that the newspaper, closed earlier this year, had reached both ‘the depths and the heights’ of journalism. Rhodri Davies QC said that the company now accepted that phone hacking may have gone on after 2007 – when the paper’s royal editor Clive Goodman was jailed – and went beyond a ‘single rogue reporter’. Guilty: Clive Goodman, left, was jailed in 2007 along with private detective Glenn Mulcaire, right. Hacking 'may have continued' at the paper after the cases . But he said the paper also produced . major investigations, such as the Pakistan cricket fixing affair, a . scandal initially ignored by police. Contrition: News International's lawyer Rhodri Davies QC . From Monday the inquiry will hear . from 21 witnesses, including film and TV stars and relatives of crime . victims, who will tell of the impact of having their phone messages . intercepted or their privacy intruded upon by the Press. The first live evidence is expected to come from the family of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Allegations that Milly’s voicemail . was hacked on behalf of the News of the World after her disappearance . triggered the public outrage that led David Cameron to launch a public . inquiry into the Press. Among those expected to appear, the . inquiry heard, are J K Rowling, Hugh Grant, Sienna Miller, Steve Coogan, . Sheryl Gascoigne, Charlotte Church, Anne Diamond, Max Mosley, Alastair . Campbell and Christopher Jeffries, who was wrongly suspected of Joanna . Yeates’s murder. A further 30 ‘core participants’ will submit evidence . in the form of written statements. Yesterday Mr Davies said: ‘It is . right that at the formal opening of this inquiry and in public, I should . repeat on behalf of News International the apologies that have been . made to all those whose phones were hacked or whose families, friends or . associates’ phones were hacked, by or at the behest of staff working at . the News of the World. ‘That phone hacking was wrong. It was shameful. It should never have happened. Probe: A policeman walks through the security gates at News International's Wapping plant in London earlier this year . ‘News International apologises for it unreservedly. Denial: The Sun 'did not' hack into the phone of Jude Law, pictured . ‘We accept that there was no public . interest justification for it and we further accept that it was not the . subject of a proper and thorough investigation until the Metropolitan . Police began Operation Weeting in January this year, following the . supply of certain material to them by News International.’ But he added: ‘Tragically, the News . of the World managed to plumb both the depths and the heights. The . depths, I need hardly say, are taken up by phone hacking. ‘The heights are well illustrated by . the remarkable piece of investigative journalism which exposed very . recently the willingness of international cricketers to take money to . fix events in cricket matches and led to the convictions of three . cricketers. ‘It was an investigation which no . private citizen could have taken on, and which no government organ or . professional body showed any inclination to take on.’ Mr Davies described the commissioning . of a former detective to carry out numerous surveillance operations for . the paper as ‘wholly unacceptable’ and ‘not journalism’. But he added: ‘Not everyone who . worked at the News of the World was involved. There were many fine . reporters and staff who worked at that newspaper who had no involvement . in phone hacking and who have suffered in the fallout.’ Mr Davies said he ‘was surprised’ by . claims from Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, that 27 News . International employees were involved in commissioning investigator . Glenn Mulcaire to phone hack and said ‘our understanding is it certainly . does not add up to 27’. He also disputed Mr Jay’s claims that Jude Law’s phone was hacked ‘by or for the Sun’. The whole of the British Press must not be tarnished by the illegal activities at the News of the World, the inquiry was urged. Jonathan Caplan QC, counsel for Associated Newspapers, which publishes the Daily Mail, Mail on Sunday and Metro, said: ‘We are anxious that the allegations of phone hacking should not be allowed to besmirch the profession as a whole.’ He told Lord Justice Leveson: ‘We need to be clearly aware that any recommendations or restrictions which come out of this inquiry are not simply introduced on the basis of historic transgressions which no longer occur.’ Setting out the position of the newspaper group, Mr Caplan added: ‘It condemns the practice of phone hacking, and so far as it is aware, no journalist at Associated Newspapers has engaged in phone hacking. ‘It does not bribe police officers and, in particular, it condemns the shameful practice of hacking the mobile phones of the victims of crime or of their families.’ He told the inquiry: ‘Of course there is always room for improvement, and for better practices. ‘We do wish, however, to stress that Press standards have vastly improved over the last 20 years under the Press Complaints Commission and under the Editors’ Code of Conduct. ‘Most journalists are hard-working, conscientious and honest, and they passionately believe in what they do.’ Mr Caplan went on: ‘No one involved in this inquiry or outside this room could seriously doubt that a free Press, which is independent of government, is essential to any democracy.’ He said the Daily Mail and its sister paper the Mail on Sunday are successful because they connect with their readership and their values, and went on: ‘That readership will stop buying those newspapers if they feel that they cannot trust its integrity or accuracy.’ Referring to Operation Motorman, an investigation by the Information Commissioner into inquiry agent Stephen Whittamore, who was commissioned by most national papers, including the Daily Mail, the barrister said: ‘The activity which Stephen Whittamore was hired to undertake almost a decade ago was primarily to obtain addresses and telephone numbers, most of which could legally have been obtained if the individual had had the time to research it. ‘It should also be stressed that Mr Whittamore did not work simply for newspapers. He was hired by organisations such as banks, local authorities and firms of solicitors who similarly were seeking to locate people.’ After the Information Commissioner’s report into Whittamore was published in 2006, Paul Dacre, editor-in-chief of Associated Newspapers, banned the use of all inquiry agents, said Mr Caplan, and all Associated journalists are required to abide by the Editors’ Code of Conduct.","Hacking may have gone on after 2007, company admit .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 4:56 PM on 10th November 2011 . A couple were caught on camera repeatedly throwing their pet dog into the sea, a court heard. John Nesbitt, 62, and Linda Jones, 51, hurled their four year old terrier dog called Jess into the sea  from a slipway at Exmouth, Devon. Jess narrowly avoided injury as she plunged head first towards the concrete just below the surface of the sea. The little dog twisted in the air as she flew towards the seas. She was thrown in at least four times. The court heard that the couple were photographed by an eye witness. Suffering: Linda Jones, 51, hurls four-year-old terrier, Jess, into the sea at Exmouth, Devon. The dog twists in the air before hitting the shallow water below . Jones and Nesbitt, both from Exmouth, Devon, were convicted of a charge of causing unnecessary suffering to an animal. The couple claimed they were just trying to keep their pet cool during a hot day in April. Prosecutor Clifford Howard told Exeter magistrates court that an eye witness 'was on Exmouth docks taking some pictures and witnessed the incident - and his photos were shown to the court. Police arrested the pair and interviewed them.’ Prosecutor Clifford Howard said: ‘Both of them accepted that the dog called Jess was thrown into the sea by them. However they claimed they were cooling her down because she was hot.’ Mr Howard said beneath the water was a concrete slipway but said the couple would not know how shallow the water was at the point and where the solid concrete was under the sea. The prosecutor said the first photos showed Mr Nesbitt throwing Jess into the water after holding her in his arms. The second batch showed Jones holding her before launching her into the sea from shoulder height and the dog 'hitting the water'. Mr Howard said Jess would have been in danger of hitting the concrete base of the slipway. Mr Clews said: ‘The male picked up the dog and chucked it into the sea. It went into the sea and got back out. Then the woman picked it up and she chucked it in the sea. I saw the dog hit the water.’ Photos don't lie: Jones holds the pet dog, Jess, aloft before swinging her forward and . releasing her. The court said the dog could have been hurt on the . concrete slipway below the water, she told police she couldn't lift the small dog . Poor Jess: The little terrier is bent uncomfortably as Jones throws the dog. The astonishing scenes were captured by a shocked eye witness . Jones told the magistrates: ‘I am so angry. I know the sea like the back of my hand. I just want my baby back.’ Jones told police in her interview: ‘I did not throw the dog in the water, Mr Nesbitt did. I could not have thrown her into the sea, I couldn't pick her up, she is too heavy to throw into the sea. ‘She was just going in for a swim - to wetten her.’ But later she admitted: ‘I did throw her into the sea’ but said she 'plopped' her in. Four year old Jess was unhurt but a vet said she could have been as she twisted face first into the shallow water. Jones said: ‘All my dogs go into the sea. The water was clear, it was not dangerous. It was a lovely hot day in April. I would gladly do it again. ‘Whoosh, she goes to the bottom and up she comes. She is 18 inches tall and shakes herself off. She swims out of the sea - doggy paddles. It wasn't that shallow, the tide was coming in.’ Nesbitt said they both threw her in twice and Nesbitt said Jess flew a 'few feet' in the air into the sea. He called them 'little dips in the sea'. The black and tan terrier has not been allowed back with them since their arrest in May. Defence lawyer Jeremy Tricks did not call either defendant to give evidence. He said: ‘Linda Jones handling of the dog was foolish.’ But he argued that the did not cause Jess unnecessary suffering and that dogs are 'resilient animals'. Exeter magistrates convicted them after hearing from vet David Cooper that Jess could have suffered injuries to her spine, legs and jaw after twisting and plunging into the sea. The magistrates said the pair should have known their actions could have caused the dog suffering. The Crown want a life ban on them keeping animals and an order depriving them of Jess. Jess is still in boarding RSPCA kennels. Sentence was adjourned until next month.","Terrier was repeatedly tossed into water inches above concrete slipway .

"By . Kerry Mcqueeney . Last updated at 2:25 PM on 5th October 2011 . For a vegetarian it might seem an odd choice of past time. But self-taught taxidermist Nicola Hebson has turned her fascination with dead animals into a prosperous venture. The 21-year-old fine art graduate, from Blackburn in Lancashire, spends up to 20 hours carefully extracting the innards of animals before lovingly preserving the carcasses and selling them on eBay. Death imitating art: Taxidermist Nicola Hebson with two of her rat creations at her home near Blackburn . Stuffed: Five of Nicola's rodent creations lay on her workstation, next to her taxidermy tools . Nicola's unusual hobby is even more surprising as she is a dedicated vegetarian who, by her own admissions, is 'very squeamish'. However, she is making a tidy profit with her cadaverous creations, which includes a collection of stuffed rats - one of which has been turned into a handbag. One of her special rodents sold for £67 on eBay and the student has put the cash towards a dream trip to India. Nicola insists her taxidermy enterprise is strictly ethical: She never kills for her art and only uses animals that are already dead, whether it is the rodent victim of her cat or roadkill she finds on the street. Ethical enterprise: Nicola says she never kills for her art and only uses roadkill or rodents caught by her pet cat . She said: 'I have always collected . things that i find dead, flies and moths, pigeon feathers, flattened . dried out toads, skulls. So I think that it has kind of developed from . that. 'This gave me the idea to practise taxidermy on mice meant for snake feed as well as any road kill I would find. 'I . am generally very squeamish to most peoples surprise. Some people get . angry because they think I go out with a gun killing everything. 'But when I explain to them that I use road kill and frozen snake food they think its fine. 'It is more gruesome cutting up a tomato in my opinion' 'Me and my best friend, Chloe are both vegetarians and she used to hate my taxidermy, but now she has warmed to it. 'My friends and family are pretty normal about me playing with dead things and stuffing them. My mum even lets me do it in my room now.' Nicola's collection includes 14 rodent works of art - some of which have already been sold or given away to family and friends as gifts. Explaining her artistic technique, she added: 'If someone was to bring me a dead mouse, I would start off by putting it in the freezer for a few days. 'When I am ready to begin the taxidermy process I thaw out the mouse. Self-taught: The fine art graduate has given some of her works to her friends and family . 'I make an incision right down the back from the neck to near the end of the tail, with a fresh surgical blade. 'I carefully separate the membranes of skin from the skin attached to the head of the mouse. 'It is important to wire the insides so that it retains some sort of posture and structure. 'After I have filled the mouse with some sort of stuffing I sew up the back with a sturdy sewing needle and then begin to add finishing touches to the face. 'You have to leave the animal for a while in the position you want so it will dry and be sturdy. 'Also if it is a very fluffy animal such as a baby rabbit the fur will need a lot of blow drying.' Nicola says she is influenced by an old British tradition of taxidermy art, which stretches back to the early Victorian era. She said: 'I am very inspired by the taxidermist Walter Potter. I used to think taxidermy was a very negative and disturbing hobby until I found out about his work. 'Taxidermy is a very delicate process and if done correctly there won't be any blood at all. It is more gruesome cutting up a tomato in my opinion.' Walter Potter, widely considered to be a master taxidermist, lived from 1835 to 1918 and created famously strange scenes of mice, rats, frogs, cats and dogs all playing together like humans in bizarre scenes. His work was hugely popular during his lifetime - and many of his bizarre creations were displayed at a museum dedicated to him in Bramber, Sussex. Because of financial difficulty in 1983 the collection moved to Jamaica Inn in Cornwall before being auctioned off in 2003, fetching £529,900.

"By . Hugo Gye . Last updated at 12:37 PM on 15th November 2011 . Inflation fell slightly today, but remained far above the Government's target thanks to yet another increase in energy bills. The Consumer Price Index rate of inflation was five per cent for October, down from 5.2 per cent in September, according to the Office for National Statistics. The Retail Price Index rate, which is more closely linked to the costs of home ownership, fell to 5.4 per cent from 5.6 per cent the previous month. The fall in inflation reflects last month's 'price war' between major retailers, which saw them aggressively cut food and petrol prices in an attempt to compete with each other. Bank of England: Inflation remains well above the Bank's target of two per cent . Despite the fall, CPI is still more than double . the target of two per cent, meaning that the governor of the Bank of . England will have to write an explanatory letter for the eighth . consecutive quarter. The high inflation was driven by energy prices once again as increases from Npower came into effect, following previous rises from British Gas, SSE, Scottish Power and E.ON and ahead of a similar move from EDF this month. Heavy discounting from food retailers - including the UK's biggest supermarkets, which have been engaged in an aggressive price war - has slightly eased overall prices. But the figure was still high enough to trigger a letter of explanation from Bank of England governor Sir Mervyn King to the Chancellor - his eighth quarter in a row and 13th in total. Sir Mervyn, who will be at Buckingham . Palace today to be formally knighted by the Queen, has previously . forecast inflation to surpass five per cent before coming down rapidly . over the next year. Both CPI and RPI have remained fairly high over the last couple of years . The . Bank is expected to slash its forecasts for growth and inflation in its . quarterly inflation report tomorrow, as a raft of key indicators suggest . that the economy might head into reverse. The . weaker growth outlook is likely to push down the inflation projection - . but this will be slightly offset by the impact of the £75billion round . of quantitative easing unleashed in October. However, good economic news came . today as it was announced that both France and Germany had seen . significant rises in GDP during the third quarter of 2011. Sir Mervyn King: The governor must write a letter to the Chancellor explaining the high rates . Sir Mervyn said the Bank is now faced with the possibility of inflation undershooting the two per cent target due to 'substantial risks around the global economic recovery and the implications of a further slowdown in the world economy for the UK.' Germany's economy grew by 0.5 per cent from July to September, while France's grew by 0.4 per cent in that period. In the UK, gas and electricity bills applied the most significant upward pressure on the overall rate of inflation in October, rising 1.4 per cent and 1.5 per cent respectively over the course of the month. In total, energy bills have risen by 19.9 per cent over the last year as they have driven stubbornly high levels of overall inflation. Food prices had the most significant downward impact to the change in CPI between September and October as they fell 0.9 per cent. The ONS said 'significant and . widespread discounting by supermarkets' pushed prices down, as well as a . strong harvest for certain products. Vegetable . prices fell 2.4 per cent, fruit eased 1.6 per cent, milk, cheese and . eggs dropped 1.2 per cent and meat edged down 0.7 per cent. Tesco triggered a price war with its rivals in October with its £500million Big Price Drop campaign. Competitors . soon responded with their own schemes, including Sainsbury's Brand . Match campaign, while Asda slashing prices at the petrol pumps. This made shop price inflation fall back markedly to 2.1 per cent from 2.7 per cent, according to the British Retail Consortium. Price cutting: Heavy discounts from major supermarkets has contributed to October's fall in inflation . There were signs of further relief as Debenhams launched its annual five-day pre-Christmas promotion with £200million savings with price cuts of up to 40% in stores and online. BRC director general Stephen Robertson said it was a sign retailers were responding to households' severely strained budgets. He said: 'With consumers' budgets under severe pressure, competition between retailers has intensified. Supermarkets are cutting their already thin margins even further to hold down shop prices in the face of rising energy and property costs.' A six per cent fall in air fares and a slight 0.4 per cent dip in petrol pump prices also helped bring the overall CPI rate down. The average price of petrol was £1.34 in October, the lowest since July. The cost of air travel could rise again, however, as airlines are hit by the high price of fuel. Budget . carrier easyJet warned today that its fuel costs were set to rise by . £220million, having already increased by £100million over the last year. Fall: Air fares went down by six per cent between September and October, but may rise as easyJet forecasts a hike in fuel prices . Today's data was published as Prime Minister David Cameron faced a damaging Commons revolt by Tory backbenchers over rising fuel prices. A Treasury spokesman said: 'Whilst price inflation eased slightly in October, the Government recognises that these are difficult times for households as prices continue to be affected by conditions in the global oil and gas markets. 'The Bank of England has forecast that inflation should fall rapidly over 2012 but, in the meantime, the Government is taking action to help consumers with current high costs, including cutting fuel duty and freezing council tax.' Labour Treasury spokesman Owen Smith said: 'Families and pensioners are really feeling the squeeze because the VAT rise and the Government's failure to act on soaring energy prices are pushing up inflation. 'With Britain now having the highest inflation of any EU country except Estonia, it's time out-of-touch ministers started taking some responsibility and took action now. 'Reversing January's VAT rise temporarily, as part of Labour's five-point plan for jobs, would ease the squeeze on families and help to kick-start our flatlining economy. It would cut petrol prices by 3p a litre and give a couple with children an average boost of £450 a year.' TUC general secretary Brendan Barber said high prices meant families were facing a tough Christmas. He said: 'The small ease in inflation will provide some comfort for families but until wages keep up with prices, people's real incomes will continue to deteriorate.' However, most economists said the figures were likely to represent the start of a marked downward trend in the rate of inflation. Vicky Redwood, chief UK economist at Capital Economics, said: 'Fingers crossed, October's drop in inflation should mean that we have now passed the peak in inflation. The start of 2012 should see inflation begin to fall back sharply and we think that it will be below the 2% target within a year.'","CPI was 5.0% in October, RPI was 5.4% .

"By . Rick Dewsbury . Last updated at 4:53 PM on 14th November 2011 . Twenty-eight News International employees are named in a notebook belonging to private detective Glenn Mulcaire, the phone hacking inquiry was told today. The notebooks of the former investigator include references to the Sun and the Daily Mirror as well as for a series of News of the World journalists, the inquiry was told. Robert Jay QC, counsel to the inquiry, said that senior executives had either failed to make the proper checks or they had condoned hacking. In either case there was 'room for a Nelsonian blind eye' towards the 'thriving cottage industry'. Mr Jay said that Mulcaire wrote first names in the top left-hand corner of his notes recording details of the telephone voicemails he illegally intercepted. References to Max Clifford, left, and Elle Macpherson, right, were found in Mulcaire's notepad, the inquiry was told . Some of these corresponded to News of . the World employees, one of whom - referred to only as 'A' - apparently . made 1,453 separate requests for information from Mulcaire. But the private detective also wrote 'The Sun' and a name relating to the Daily Mirror in his notebooks, the inquiry was told. Mulcaire . was jailed with the News of the World’s former royal editor Clive . Goodman in January 2007 after they admitted intercepting voicemail . messages left on phones belonging to members of the royal household. The . inquiry heard that the investigator’s notes relating to the royal aides . are marked 'Clive', 'private' and with the name of 'A', who cannot be . named for fear of prejudicing the ongoing police investigation into . phone hacking. Robert Jay . QC, counsel to the inquiry, said: 'One possible inference to be drawn . is that ''A'' was working with or for Goodman, and he or she may have . instructed Mulcaire to carry out an interception. Jailed: Glenn Mulcaire was found guilty of hacking phones for the News of the World . 'It . might be argued that ''A'' could have been acting independently of . Goodman, but that would not make much sense since Goodman was the royal . editor.' Mr Jay added: 'Either News International senior management knew what was going on at the time and therefore, at the very least, condoned this illegal activity. 'Or they didn't and News International's systems failed to the extent that there was failure in supervision, failure of oversight with possible failures of training and corporate ethos and checking of expenses claims. 'And there's room for a Nelsonian blind eye. In either version, we have clear evidence of a generic, systematic or cultural problem. He added: 'I suggest that it would not be unfair to comment that it was at the very least a thriving cottage industry.' Mulcaire also . pleaded guilty to hacking the phones of publicist Max Clifford, football . agent Sky Andrew, chairman of the Professional Footballers Association . Gordon Taylor, MP Simon Hughes and supermodel Elle Macpherson. His notes for Mr Clifford feature the . name 'A' and 'private', for Mr Andrew a person referred to as 'I'; for . Mr Taylor 'A'; for Mr Hughes 'A' and people named only as 'B' and 'C'; . and for Ms Macpherson 'B' and 'private'. In total about 28 legible corner . names are legible in the 11,000 pages of notes that police seized from . Mulcaire, which relate to a total of 2,266 taskings and the names of . 5,795 potential victims, the inquiry heard. 'A' requested information from the . private investigator on 1,453 occasions, followed by 'B' on 303, 'C' on . 252, and someone identified as 'D' on 135. Mr Jay said: 'We have a range of corner names. I know the names in each . case, but obviously do not know anything about the corner name ‘private’ or its significance. 'We only have the first name in each . of the cases, but they happen to tie up with the first names of . employees of News International.' The inquiry heard that actor Jude Law has brought a claim against the Sun for allegedly hacking his phone. Mr Jay said: 'Part of the evidential . matrix in support of his case is a corner name in the Mulcaire notebook . which simply states ''the Sun'' without specifying the individual . working there.' The barrister added: 'There is also documentary evidence which we have seen of another corner name relating to the Mirror.' Lord Justice Leveson this morning opened the inquiry into media standards that was set up after the News of the World phone hacking scandal. Neil Garnham QC, representing the Met Police, left, and Shami Chakrabarti, right, who is on the Leveson Inquiry panel, seen arriving at the High Court today . He is examining the 'culture, practices and ethics of the press' and looking at whether media self-regulation works. The . appeal court judge will hear evidence from phone hacking victims while . considering whether self-regulation of the media works. Lord Justice Leveson warned editors against targeting people who speak out against intrusion by journalists. The Court . of Appeal judge was watched by Bob Dowler, the father of murdered . schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Her phone was hacked by the News of the World. Lord Justice Leveson said . his team would monitor newspaper coverage over the coming months for . any evidence that witnesses to his hearings were being singled out for . negative stories. Lord Justice Leveson opened the inquiry today at the Royal Courts of Justice . The chairman stressed that the freedom of the press was 'fundamental' to the UK's democracy and way of life. He . also recognised that there was a 'great deal to applaud' in Britain's . present press, adding: 'I certainly do not intend to limit my . consideration to activities which could be the subject of criticism.' But he stressed that he would be alert to any evidence of newspapers victimising witnesses who complained about press intrusion. Lord . Justice Leveson said: 'Concern has specifically been expressed that . those who speak out might be targeted adversely by the press as a . result. 'I have absolutely . no wish to stifle freedom of speech and expression, but I anticipate . that monitoring will take place of press coverage over the months to . come. 'And if it . appears that those concerns are made out, without objective . justification, it might be appropriate to draw the conclusion that these . vital rights are being abused, which itself would provide evidence of . culture, practice and ethics which could be relevant to my ultimate . recommendations.' David Cameron set up the Leveson Inquiry in July after . revelations that a private detective working for the News of the World . hacked the phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler. Lord Justice Leveson said the task of his investigation could be summed up in one simple question: 'Who guards the guardians?' He said freedom of expression and freedom of the press must be exercised 'with the rights of others in mind'. He said he had encouraged newspaper . editors to meet and discuss these issues outside his hearings and put . forward proposals for how the press could be better regulated. Victims: The phone of murdered schoolgirl Milly Dowler, left, was . hacked. Her father, Bob, right, attended the opening of the inquiry . today . News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch, left, has faced pressure over the hacking scandal. Senior executive Rebekah Brooks, right, resigned . Probe: A policeman walks through the security gates at News International's Wapping plant in London . 'Those ideas must reflect the fundamental freedoms to which I have referred,' he said. 'But it must also recognise that 'guard the guardians' is not an optional add-on. 'Neither . is it good enough if it does not take account of the legitimate public . concern, not only about phone hacking, but also other unethical . behaviour not justified by what is truly in the public interest.' The first part of the inquiry is looking at the culture, practices and ethics of the press in general. The second part, examining the extent . of unlawful activities by journalists, will not begin until detectives . have completed their work and any prosecutions have concluded. Milly's father Bob was among those who attended the start of the inquiry in Court 73 of the Royal Courts of Justice. In an opening statement to Lord . Justice Leveson and his panel, counsel to the inquiry Robert Jay QC, . said the public probe was born of an 'extraordinary series of . revelations' which resulted in the demise of the News of the World, . along with high profile resignations at the top of the Met Police. 'The media trigger for the set up of . this inquiry was the revelation that Milly Dowler's voicemail was hacked . into and deleted causing family and friends to cling to the hope that . she might still be alive,' he said. 'Although the individual or . individuals who deleted Milly's voicemail messages back in 2002 might . not have realised at the time what the consequence might be in terms of . raising false hopes, the public was ultimately sickened by the . carelessness and cynicism of the perpetrators.' Within two days of this revelation, . the Prime Minister announced to parliament that an inquiry would be set . up, Mr Jay told a room packed with lawyers, eminent QCs, media figures . and journalists. Mr Jay said the inquiry set out to expose the 'truth' and find 'practical and workable' answers. But he added: 'These solutions will not . necessarily have been the solutions which the press themselves would . have devised but they will have to be workable in the real world both . today and in the immediate future. 'Most particularly, the challenge is posed by the internet.The inquiry will also seek to identify where problems within the media might stem from, considering whether these may have been high up in organisations, exist because of a failure to stamp out bad practices or whether misdemeanours were systematic.' But he added: 'Even if the inquiry was to conclude that a culture existed in a particular newspaper that would not mean that everyone else within that newspaper was inevitably tarnished by it.'","The Sun and Daily Mirror also written in his notebook .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 4:25 PM on 15th November 2011 . Occupy London protesters will be evicted from St Paul's after talks with City authorities broke down, it was announced today. It comes just hours after riot police stormed Occupy Wall Street in New York forcing protesters out of the camp that has become a global movement's focal point. The City of London Corporation has put the blame firmly on the protesters who it said failed to agree to leave in January 2012 or to shrink the camp. Occupy out: The City of London confirmed it was relaunching legal proceedings against protesters today . Stuart Fraser, policy chairman at the corporation, said: 'We paused legal action for two weeks for talks with those in the camp on how to shrink the extent of the tents and to set a departure date - but got nowhere. 'So, sadly, now they have rejected a reasonable offer to let them stay until the new year, it's got to be the courts. 'We'd still like to sort this without court action but from now on we will have to have any talks in parallel with court action - not instead.' Talks broken down: City officials claim protestors would not agree to shrink the camp or move in January 2012 . A notice regarding the decision is expected to be served to the Occupy London movement tomorrow. Mr Fraser said: 'We are getting reports about vulnerable people, cases of late-night drinking and other worrying trends, so it's time to act. It will clearly take time but we are determined to see this through. 'Lawful protesters who stand or walk are a regular part of London. But tents, equipment and now, increasingly, quite a lot of mess, is not what a highway is for and others are losing out.' Ronan McNern, a spokesman for Occupy London, said: 'It's really sad this is the way the City of London Corporation thought they had to go. 'To be honest, it's really disappointing that they cut off the process of dialogue. 'However, if they want to go down this route we have a legal team who are fully prepared. 'It's significant that the City of London Corporation announced this today just as there have been violent evictions in New York and across the United States.' The chapter of St Paul's Cathedral are meeting tomorrow to consider their response, a cathedral spokesman said. Hard at work: A protester with a mask of David Cameron on his head cleans the Occupy London camp area outside St Paul's Cathedral. Notices given to the protesters in New York said the park 'poses an increasing health and fire safety hazard to those camped in the park, the city's first responders and the surrounding community'. Protesters were told they could return within hours, but without sleeping bags, tarps or tents. Occupy London organisers have called for supporters to meet outside the US Embassy in London this afternoon. Occupy London said in a statement: 'As part of the gathering, Americans allied with Occupy Wall Street and Occupy London will demand entry to the embassy to question the ambassador on events happening in New York.' Unruly behaviour: The City said reports of unruly behaviour after dark also made it reconsider legal action . Mr Fraser said City of London Corporation had taken the decision to pursue legal action some time ago, but 'where we've had our finger on the pause button, we've now taken it off'. Protesters will be told to remove their tents and equipment within 24 hours. If they remain, proceedings will be issued in the High Court. It is thought London protesters were aiming to . stay through the Olympic Games next summer –which would guarantee . international attention for their cause and embarrassment for the . Government. Riot gear: A man is confronted by New York Police Department officers as . New York City officials clear the Occupy Wall Street protest from . Zuccotti Park today . Mr Fraser said talks with the protesters made it clear that they 'are not going to move any time soon'. He said: 'We have a responsibility to clear the highway, which is frankly for the use of everybody. We don't have a choice in this.' Mr Fraser said businesses near St Paul's Cathedral have complained and are concerned they will suffer trading losses in the run-up to Christmas. The Corporation is expecting a legal challenge from the protesters. 'I am quite sure their legal teams are on standby,' said Mr Fraser. Archbishop: Dr Rowan Williams (left) has kept . his counsel since the protest began but, after the resignation of Dean . of St Paul's Cathedral Graeme Knowles (right), he has spoken and backed . the demonstrators . Court action is likely to take weeks. In a statement, the City of London Corporation said no enforcement action will take place without a further committee debate. The Corporation's bid does not extend to tents on land belonging to St Paul's Cathedral, which suspended its legal action against the protesters on November 1. Two senior St Paul’s clergy have resigned during the crisis: the Dean, the Very Rev Graeme Knowles, and Canon Chancellor Giles Fraser . The demonstraters, who arrived outside the cathedral in October as a ragtag group retreating from a failure to occupy the nearby Stock Exchange,  elevated their protest camp into a direct challenge to the Government and its attempt to resist the long-running French and German campaign to attack the wealth of the City.","Officials say protesters rejected 'reasonable offer' to stay until January 2012 .

At least four shots were fired at the popular Juliet Supperclub night spot in Chelsea, New York where actor Ryan Phillippe and singer Estelle had also been partying. Two men were hit by the gunshots fired from a 9mm handgun at around 2.20am with one of the men being fatally wounded. Shots fired: The popular Juliet Supperclub night spot in Chelsea, New York, was the scene of the shooting . Members of the New York Giants and Kansas City Chiefs had been in the club, although it is not clear when they left, according to a police source. Another source said the Giants wide receiver Cruz had been celebrating his 25th birthday and was inside the building when the shots were fired. Brandon Albert and Jarrad Paige from the Chiefs and NBA stars John Wall, Russell Westbrook, Chris Duhon and Bronx native Kemba Walker were said to have been at the club on the same night. It was not clear whether any of them had been there during the frightening incident. Guests: NFL star Victor Cruz (left) and actor Ryan Phillippe had been in the club . It is thought around 300 clubbers were inside the venue when shots were fired early on Tuesday morning. The man who was fatally wounded was identified as Artis Arthur, 43, of Brooklyn, who was shot in the torso. Tracy Ryals, 28, of The Bronx, and Jonai Washington, 28, of Long Island, were also wounded during the incident, according to the New York Post. The shooting at Juliet Supperclub comes just two months after a club promoter fatally stabbed another man outside the club's velvet ropes. Manuel 'Manny Stax' Pinero, 41, was arrested for murdering Christopher Adames, 23. Police are investigated how the gunman managed to smuggle a weapon into the venue, as the club normally insists in searching revellers before entry.","Giants star Victor Cruz had been celebrating birthday at club where man was shot dead .

"Jerry Sandusky, who faces sexual abuse charges, received $60,000 a year after retirement . By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 12:59 AM on 17th November 2011 . Former Penn State football coach Joe Paterno is eligible for half a million dollars in pension after spending 46 years in charge at the university. Paterno, 84, was fired as head coach last week after his former second-in-command Jerry Sandusky . was charged with sexually abusing boys over a period of 15 years. It has also been confirmed that Sandusky collects $59,000 annual pension and withdrew $148,000 upon retirement from his job at Penn State, according to records obtained by the Associated Press. Sweet package: Penn State's former football coach Joe Paterno, with his wife Sue on the front porch of their house, could be in line for $500,000 pension . The formula used by the State Employees' Retirement System (SERS) makes Paterno eligible for a pension equal to 100 per cent of the average of his three highest-salary years. His pay rose from $541,000 to $568,000 over the past three years. There also is a long-service supplement that could boost Paterno to 110 per cent of his final average salary. A spokesman for SERS said . benefit limits may apply, so the agency was unable to give an estimate of Paterno's full package before it was awarded. Handcuffed: Former Penn State football defensive coordinator Jerry Sandusky, who has been charged with sexually abusing eight boys, withdraws a pension of $59,000 each year . When Paterno retires, he will have to . make decisions about his pension, including whether to . bequeath benefits to a loved one after he dies and whether to obtain . a one-time, lump-sum payment of his own contributions. It was also revealed that Paterno transferred full ownership of his house to his wife Sue for $1 in July, according to the New York Times. The couple had previously both been on the deeds for the house. Paterno's attorney Wick Sollers told the Times in an email that the transfer had nothing to do with the scandal but was part of an ongoing 'planning program'. Local hero: A quote by former Penn State coach Joe Paterno - who many fans have come out in support of after he was removed from his post after 46 years of service . Paterno has not been charged with . any crime. However the 83-year-old, who was in his 46th year as head . coach of the Nittany Lions and winner of two national championships, has . been criticised for not doing more to intervene when incidents of . Sandusky's abuse came to light. A graduate assistant went to Paterno after he allegedly saw Sandusky raping a boy in the football team's locker room shower. A grand jury report said Paterno contacted the athletic director but did not go to police, and he has said he wishes he had done more. It was announced today that a new judge has been appointed to the hearing of  accused child molester Sandusky. Conflict of interests: Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who once volunteered at Sandusky's charity Second Mile, has been removed from his case . Robert Scott, from Westmoreland County, has been brought in after a court request for an out-of-county senior judge. Judge Leslie Dutchcot, who sits in Center County where Penn State is located, had requested Sandusky be freed on $100,000 unsecured bail on November 5. It has been claimed the judge had a conflict of interest because she was a volunteer for The Second Mile, the charity Sandusky founded. Her decision overruled a bid by prosecutors who requested a $500,000 bail be set for 67-year-old Sandusky. She also denied a request for the alleged molester to be fitted with a leg monitor, after he was charged with 21 felony counts for alleged sexual abuse. Chilling: Sandusky started the Second Mile charity in 1977 where it is alleged he picked his young victims . A spokesman for Pennsylvania Courts said Mr Scott 'has no known connections with the Pennsylvania State University, the Second Mile Charity, nor any officers or representatives of any of those entities'. The preliminary hearing for Sandusky will be held on December 7 or at another date set by Judge Scott. Sandusky has been charged with sexually abusing eight boys over a period of 15 years. In an interview earlier this week, Sandusky denied he was a paedophile but admitted that he 'shouldn't have showered with those kids'.","Jerry Sandusky, who faces sexual abuse charges, received $60,000 a year after retirement ."
"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:23 PM on 16th November 2011 . Two thirds of foreign wives could be banned from the UK under plans to stop immigrants becoming 'a burden on the state'. Government immigration advisers say that the minimum salary required to bring a spouse to Britain should go up significantly, and may even be doubled. The proposals could mean more than half of the UK's population would not be able to bring in a foreign partner, as they might not earn enough to support them without relying on benefits. And the threshold may be pushed even higher for those trying to bring children to the UK. Family: But British residents earning less than the national average wage could be barred from bringing in a partner from abroad (file photo) Professor David Metcalf, chairman of the Migration Advisory Committee, said a minimum salary of between £18,600 and £25,700 should be introduced for UK residents sponsoring a partner or dependant for UK citizenship. This minimum, which applies equally to British citizens and immigrants, is currently set at around £13,700. Some 40,000 foreign wives, husbands and partners were granted visas to join their family in the UK last year, but that number would be cut by up to 63 per cent under the proposals. The Government asked the advisers to identify the salary a worker would need to earn to support a spouse or partner 'without them becoming a burden on the state', Professor Metcalf said. The minimum salary could be even higher for those who wanted their children to join them from abroad, he added. The lowest figure in the proposed range, £18,600, is the income level at which many benefits, including housing benefit and tax credits, are withdrawn, while the highest figure, £25,700, represents the typical income of a one-adult household. It would mean that between a quarter and a half of full-time adult workers would be unable to bring their partners to the UK - but many others, including the unemployed and pensioners, could be prevented too. Wealthy: Only those earning above-average wages will be able to sponsor a spouse . Prof Metcalf said the proposals do not take into account Britons' right to a family life. 'We have to abide by the terms of reference that we are set up for, and that's to answer the questions which the Government sets us, and not go off on a track of our own,' he said. 'It's for others to then decide whether in some senses that question is a bit wrong, [if] it's in this case too economic focused, or quite possibly we've not addressed it properly.' He added that the current threshold was 'a bit low', and suggested there was 'justification for raising the pay threshold' to prevent a huge benefits bill for spouses from abroad. The MAC's figures show that of the 40,000 spouses and partners brought in from outside the EU, nearly a third were from India, Pakistan or Bangladesh, while 6 per cent came from the U.S. and 5 per cent from Nepal. It added that while 94 per cent of those based in the UK with a spouse abroad wanted their partner to join them, half earned less than £20,100 and three quarters earned less than £30,500. The Institute for Public Policy Research warned that if the Government accepted the proposals and went ahead with the policy, 'it is likely to be challenged in the courts'. Matt Cavanagh, the think-tank's associate director, said: 'It isn't unreasonable - particularly in the current economic climate - to ask whether, if someone is destitute or entirely dependent on benefits, they should be allowed to bring in a spouse or partner who is likely to end up in a similar position. 'But introducing an income threshold at £25,700 - the level of the national median income - would effectively bar half the population from bringing a spouse or partner from abroad. 'We're not talking about people who are destitute or living on benefits, we are talking about people who are working and getting an average wage.'","40,000 foreign wives, husbands and partners were granted visas to join their family in the UK last year ."
"By . Tamara Cohen . Last updated at 12:30 PM on 16th November 2011 . With autumn frosts well under way, it is hardly hosepipe ban season. Yet, just six weeks before Christmas, the public is being urged to ration its water use. The year’s topsy-turvy weather has seen several counties remain in drought for months after the lowest rainfall on record. Now water companies are urging householders to cut back on water use, amid concern that if reservoirs do not fill up, reserves could reach a critical level next summer. Dry spell: Parched areas of Pitsford Water pictured yesterday where half the normal rainfall has led to concerns over a water shortage . Wet: The reservoir near Northampton pictured with normal water levels in previous years . The east of England had only half its usual rainfall in September and October, following the driest Spring for 80 years. In March and April just one inch of . rain fell – a fifth of what is normal for the season and about the . typical level for North Africa. Northamptonshire, Cambridgeshire and . South Lincolnshire have had their driest year on record. Other . drought-stricken areas are parts of Bedfordshire and Norfolk. Anglian Water, which serves six . million homes and businesses, yesterday applied to the Environment . Agency for a permit to drain extra water from the River Nene to feed . reservoirs in Pitsford and Rutland Water which are half-full. Shortages: Anglian Water has applied for a winter drought permit so it can drain extra water from the River Nene to feed its reservoir at Rutland Water . It has applied to drain an extra 17million litres a day between December and April. Spokesman Ciaran Nelson said: ‘You usually think of having to save water when it is hot. ‘But this is the time of year when we . need to save water the most as the reservoirs should be filling up . ready for next spring.’ He said householders should take . measures such as lagging pipes so they don’t freeze, as well as basics . such as not keeping water running while brushing their teeth. Farmers are also irrigating at night to reduce the amount of water evaporating. Unseasonable: Bright sunshine at Stourhead National Trust estate this weekend. The weather in the UK has been so warm this autumn that farmers are irrigating at night time to reduce the amount of water evaporating . Another spokesman for the firm explained: 'Last year's winter . was the most severe since records began over 100 years ago. If that . wasn't enough, we saw an average 20 per cent less winter rainfall in our supply . region, followed by the driest spring in over 80 years. 'Despite these exceptional challenges we kept water supplies secure, and . by the start of spring we had replenished our reservoirs. 'However, . through spring, rainfall remained exceptionally low, particularly in the . west of the region. 'If the dry conditions were to continue throughout this winter, storage . levels at Pitsford would not recover and would remain very low. 'That's . why we're taking prudent action now, applying for a drought permit to . try to keep water supplies secure and customers' taps flowing.' Environment Secretary Caroline Spelman: 'Despite our reputation as a rainy country, planning for unreliable rainfall is something we all need to do' The last time such a permit was applied for during the autumn or winter months was in 2003, the Environment Agency said . David Hawley, a manager for the . Agency, said: 'Balancing the needs of people, businesses and . the environment for water has been a difficult job this year. 'Farmers . have been working hard to make the best use of the water they have and . we've been busy planning supplies and monitoring what's going on. 'But if we have a dry winter, this could make next year far more difficult for everyone than this year has been. 'That's . why we're asking everyone to look at their water use and see how it can . be reduced now so that there's enough to go around next year too.' Environment . Secretary Caroline Spelman said: 'Farmers, water companies and other . abstractors have worked really hard over the summer to help keep our . rivers flowing and head off any threat of hosepipe bans. 'Northamptonshire . and South Lincolnshire are amongst a number of areas taking steps now . to safeguard the water supply next summer and, despite our reputation as . a rainy country, planning for unreliable rainfall is something we all . need to do.'","Farmers having to irrigate at night to reduce amount of water evaporating as the weather is so warm .

"By . Emily Allen . Last updated at 1:32 PM on 17th November 2011 . A World War ll bomber pilot is to . have his dying wish - of military bands striking up again in his . favourite park - granted thanks to a High Court ruling. William . 'Billy' Higham left £2million of his £7million fortune to the Wigan Leisure and Culture Trust - on condition that the bands . he loved to hear as a boy began playing again at the bandstand in his beloved Mesnes Park in the town. But Mr Higham made the bequest in a 'home-made' will with vague wording which caused legal confusion. Music to his ears: Military bands will play again at the Victorian bandstand in Mesnes Park, Wigan, thanks to a bequest from William Higham . War hero: Bomber pilot William Higham left a home-made will which caused legal confusion . Mr Higham's family took the document to . the High Court in London to get it clarified by a judge. Mr Justice Mann has now ruled bands must play as the war hero, who died childless at the age of 91 in 2008, would have wished. Mr . Higham, who flew in an elite bomber squadron during the war, grew up near Mesnes Park and spent his boyhood weekends at the . bandstand. The 19th century cast-iron structure is now being restored by the original manufacturers in Glasgow. After flying Sunderland and Lancaster bombers at the start of the war, Mr Higham was later recruited as a De Havilland Mosquito pilot for a Pathfinder squadron, which spearheaded daring raids into Germany. Coming out of the airforce, Mr Higham took over his parent's floristry business in Makinson Arcade, Wigan. The company continues to this day, now operating out of Worthington Way, but Mr Higham retired to the village of St Mawgan, in Cornwall, where he died in September 2008. Marjorie, his wife of almost 70 years, died of a stroke the following year. Michael Waterworth, for Mr Higham's nephew, John, told the High Court: 'He was a man of extraordinary energy and ability, who was decisive in business and built up a fortune of £7million.' Mr Higham's estate included a large collection of paintings by artist James Lawrence Isherwood, whose popularity in the art world has grown exponentially - along with the value of his work - since his death in 1973. The two men were primary school friends in Wigan in the 1920s and Mr Higham bought a number of works from the hard-up artist in later life. But the court heard Mr Higham struggled to decide how to divide his wealth, and left a will which was, according to Mr Waterworth, 'difficult to follow'. Childhood memories: William Higham and his five brothers lived near Mesnes Park in Wigan when they were growing up . Addressing the issue of military band concerts, Stephen Pritchard, for the Leisure and Culture Trust, said: 'The will gives no indication as to the level of performance required... the Trust simply does not know at any given point whether it is adequately performing or not.' Stripped down: Mr Higham's beloved Victorian bandstand is now being restored to its former glory . The court heard Mr Higham's family were not against the money being left to the Trust, but wanted to make sure it was spent in accordance with his wishes. After negotiations outside court, lawyers for the family and the Trust agreed a set of rules on how the money should be spent, which they put before Mr Justice Mann to approve. In his ruling, the judge said: 'The will was home made, without the assistance of solicitors. The result demonstrates what a bad idea it is for a layman to do that, and has led to the expenditure of considerable costs.' After the decision, Mr Higham's 67-year-old nephew, John Higham, said: 'Billy and his five brothers, all of whom served in the war and all of whom came back, grew up in a house next to the park, and it was a big thing back then to go and hear the bands on Sundays. 'Billy bemoaned the fact that bands had been stopped by the council due to the expense, and he always said ""Im going to put the bands back in Wigan"". 'I'm very pleased that we have agreed terms that will see big bands from around the country come to the park, as well as giving opportunities to local bands to play there. 'I hope we can arrange for a Lancaster bomber to come flying over, in memory of Billy.'",High Court approves William Higham's wishes following confusion over wording of home-made will .

Deedy, who is attached to the Bureau of Diplomatic Security, was charged with second-degree murder and using a firearm in the commission of a felony. Honolulu . police said Deedy was released from jail at 5:15 am the morning following his arrest. Police . spokesman Carolyn Sluyter said Mr Elderts, Deedy and two other men were . involved in a confrontation at the restaurant when the shooting . occurred after an earlier altercation at a nightclub. Mr Elderts suffered a gunshot wound to the chest and was taken to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Shooting: Christopher Deedy (left) has been charged in a fatal shooting in Hawaii that left Kollin Elderts dead (right) Deedy was arrested at the scene, Ms Sluyter said. She did not identify the other two men. Michael Green, an attorney for Mr . Elderts' family, said the victim and Deedy didn't know each other and . that Mr Elderts was unarmed. The shooting came as security was ramped . up in the area for the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit which started the next day. According to Mr Green, Deedy followed the victim to the McDonald's at 3am. The lawyer said the victim 'was in a club and got . into a beef with a guy who turned out to be a federal agent. The guy . followed [Elderts] to McDonald's and shot him once in the chest'. Confrontation: The fatal shooting took place inside this McDonald's at 3am on Saturday morning in Waikiki . Mr Green did not know the name of the nightclub. He added: 'Nothing good happens at three o'clock.' Mr Green told Hawaii News Now: ‘If you have a group of people, including this agent, at a bar or club, what’s the likelihood of all of them winding up at this McDonald’s shortly after that, before the club is closed? Someone apparently followed someone.’ He added: ‘He’s an agent of the federal government and my guess is he’s on duty 24 hours, just like our Honolulu Police Department people are. ‘And so there are some issues involved and there are some legal questions that have to be answered.’ Out of control: A U.S. federal agent has been charged with second-degree murder after a man was shot in the chest at a McDonald's . The attorney said that a blood alcohol test was likely to take place. 'We can't wait to see those test results,' he added. Mr Green said he was in the process of tracking any surveillance videos from the McDonald’s and surrounding businesses. Mr Elderts, 23, was a graduate of Kalaheo High School in Kailua. His criminal record consisted of a 2008 disorderly conduct violation, for which he was ordered to pay $150 and a 2010 petty misdemeanor for operating a vehicle under the influence of an intoxicant, for which he paid a $300 fine.","Agent accused of following victim to restaurant .

A fan of the popular Twilight books has taken her love of the vampire series to a more permanent level by having the characters etched across her back. Cathy Ward, from Reading, Berkshire, showed off her £4,000 body art masterpiece at the opening of Breaking Dawn: Part One, at London's Westfield Stratford City last night. And the supermarket worker had her dreams come true when she managed to get heartthrob Robert Pattinson to sign her arm. Fan: Catherine Ward has had her back tattooed with the characters from 'Twilight'. The tattoo is based on the New Moon edition and has Edward, Jacob and Bella from left to right . The 50-year-old, who spent a painful 46 hours in the tattooist's chair getting her back and arms inked, said: 'I can't believe I made it to the premiere, it is a dream come true for me. 'Robert signed my arm and I am going to get my tattooist to trace its outline so I have it on me permanently. 'I already have five tattoos of Robert and this will be the icing on the cake.' She wore a halterneck jumpsuit for last night's screening, leaving her main tattoo on show. Her entire back is covered with scenes from the books and films, and includes the faces of Pattinson's co-stars Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart. Ms Ward will now spend another £2,000 pounds getting her arms finished and another tribute tattoo across her chest. She first decided to vamp-up her image after claiming the blood-sucking stars helped her lose five stone. Pattinson's co-stars Taylor Lautner and Kristen Stewart are also featured on her back. The masterpiece cost £4,000 . She said she dropped 14 dress sizes in just six months, ditching pasties and pizza in favour of getting stuck into the popular books and films. And, she managed not to eat fatty foods despite working in the cake department of her local supermarket. She said: 'A friend of mine got me the first film on DVD because I was feeling low. 'Once I started I just couldn't stop myself. I had to go out and buy all the books and films. I got hooked. It became my way of rewarding myself. 'I wanted a permanent reminder of the amazing series so I got a small tattoo and that turned into what I have got now.' Catherine Ward said watching the films and reading the books helped her lose five stone and now she regularly exercises . Ms Ward, who has shrunk from size 24 to 10, added: 'The way I look at it I could be spending the money on going out drinking and eating but instead I'm spending it on something I am really passionate about. 'I have got a cross trainer, rowing machine and hand weights and I work out in my spare room which has got Twilight pictures all over the walls. 'I watch the films or listen to the soundtracks as I exercise. It has worked miracles.' Ms Ward was able to attend last night's premiere after appealing to German TV company RTL, who covered the event, to put her on the guest list. The four Twilight books, which have been translated into 38 different languages, have sold more than 100 million copies worldwide while the films have smashed box office records.","£4,000 tattoo features Edward, Jacob and Bella in scenes from the films ."
"By . Sara Nelson . Last updated at 4:15 PM on 16th November 2011 . Budget airline passengers could soon be spared the ordeal of a seating free-for-all when they board their flights. EasyJet is to trial allocated seating on selected routes in the spring, following a similar move by rival Ryanair. Travellers are currently unable to choose a seat until they board the plane. EasyJet is to trial allocated seating on selected routes in the spring, following a similar move by rival Ryanair . The allocated seating plan should end the stampede that usually precedes easyJet boarding times . Those who have purchased speedy . boarding or are travelling with young children have priority, but even . there is no guarantee of a particular seat. The . trial of allocated seating is seen as another step on the road to . increasing easyJet’s appeal to business customers. Shares fell 3 per . cent following today’s update. Ryanair currently charges a fee for a seat in the front row and has recently extended its reserved seating trial on 80 routes. Although the move has not made the airline's 25-minute turnaround any longer, a spokesman said the carrier has no plans to extend the programme to the entire plane. The majority of passengers taking part in easyJet’s trial are not expected to pay for their seats, although the airline has admitted it plans to charge for popular spots such as the first few rows and seats over the wings. Chief executive Carolyn McCall said it . was too early to specify how much passengers would have to pay for the . option, nor had the airline decided which routes would take part in the . trial. She told the Financial Times the trial . was dependent on positive customer feedback and added: ‘If it increases . boarding time we won’t do it.’ Carolyn McCall, easyJet chief executive, says the airline is looking at whether allocated seating increases boarding time. Meanwhile, founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou has pushed for higher shareholder dividends . The news comes as the airline revealed a rise in profits today but warned it will become harder to pass higher fuel prices on to passengers. The group reported a 31.5 per cent . increase in underlying profits to £248 million in the year to September . 30, which was at the upper end of expectations, after a sharp rise in . the number of business passengers. It . said around 45 per cent of winter seats are already booked - about the . same level as last year - but warned that weak consumer confidence . across Europe will slow the rate at which higher costs can be passed on . to passengers. The . record profits for the group came after it offset a £100 million . increase in its fuel bill by focusing on cost controls and improved . customer satisfaction levels. Its on-time performance improved by 13 . percentage points to 79 per cent. But . the group warned the macro-economic environment remains challenging, . while it is facing higher costs, including increased taxation and a £220 . million rise in its fuel costs. As a result it is taking a 'cautious . approach' to expanding its fleet, which will lead to unchanged capacity . in the first half of its financial year and growth of around 4 per cent . for the year as a whole. Ryanair has already begun allocating seats - and charging extra for the front rows . It . expects first-half passenger revenues to increase by 'mid-single . digits', helped by higher bag charges and other ancillary revenues. The group announced payments to shareholders of £195million, which is about £5million more than previously expected amid pressure from its founder Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou, who along with his family is a major shareholder. The Luton-based airline has been expanding its appeal to business customers, which tend to provide higher profits, by flying more to business routes and offering flexible fares. Passengers travelling on business routes increased by one million to 9.5 million in the year. Total revenues rose 16 per cent to £3.5 billion while revenues per seat were up 3.4 per cent to £55.27, helped by a rise in ancillary revenues. Douglas McNeill, an analyst at Charles Stanley Securities, said Carolyn McCall's first full year in charge had been a good one. But he added: 'Cost inflation looks to be greater than we had thought and pricing isn't strong enough to compensate - the upshot is that our full-year 2012 forecasts may have to be reduced.'","Trial of pre-determined seating will start on selected routes in the spring .

"By . Nick Pisa . Last updated at 7:10 PM on 16th November 2011 . Designate: Mario Monti is set to name his new Italian government today . Economist Mario Monti today formed a new Italian government without a single politician - drawing from the ranks of bankers, diplomats and business executives to make sure Italy escapes looming financial disaster. The 68-year-old former European Union competition commissioner told reporters he will serve as Italy's economy minister as well as premier for now as he seeks to implement 'sacrifices' to heal the country's finances and set the economy growing again. Monti and his new cabinet ministers will be sworn later Wednesday, formally ending Silvio Berlusconi's 3 1/2-year-old government as well as his 17-year-long run of political dominance. Monti said he would lay out his emergency anti-crisis policies in the Senate on Thursday, ahead of a confidence vote. A second vote, in the lower Chamber of Deputies, will follow, likely on Friday. He stressed that Italy's economic growth is a top priority. Hopes for Italy's new administration won it some respite in financial markets today. The yield on its ten-year bonds dropped 0.16 percentage point to 6.77 per cent. In the last week, that borrowing rate had flirted over 7 percent - the level that forced fellow eurozone members Greece, Ireland and Portugal to seek international bailouts. Up until summer, Italy had mostly avoided the European debt turmoil despite having a jaw-dropping amount of debt: 1.9 trillion euro, or nearly 120 per cent of its GDP. But after frequent delays and backtracking on austerity measures, markets lost faith that any Berlusconi government could fix Italy's economic issues. Restoring confidence in Italy's financial future is crucial because, as the third-largest economy in the eurozone, it is too big for Europe to rescue. A debt default by Italy would threaten the euro itself and shake the global economy. New government: Mr Monti poses with the new members of the Italian government after the swearing in ceremony at the Quirinale Presidential palace in Rome . Discussions: Mario Monti (centre) sits yesterday during a meeting with industrialists and union representatives at the Senate, in Rome, as he tries to form a new government . Monti gave few hints about his political programme today, sidestepping a question about whether the government would dip into citizens' bank accounts as it did decades ago during another debt crisis. 'You may ask, he replied, but went no further. Explaining why his Cabinet contained no one from Italy's fractious political parties, Monti said that his talks with party leaders led him to the conclusion 'that the non-presence of politicians in the government would help it.' His ministers include Corrado Passera, CEO of Italy's second-largest bank, Intesa Sanpaolo SpA, to head Development and Infrastructure; Piero Gnudi, a longtime chairman of Enel utility company, as Tourism and Sport minister in a country heavily dependent on tourist revenues; and the current Italian ambassador to Washington, Giulio Terzi di Sant'Agata, to be foreign minister. Spain's ruling socialist government is expected to tumble on Sunday. Voters . braving sky-high unemployment, the sting of austerity, piles of debt . and a bleak future are expected to dump the PSOE at the country's . general elections. The opposition conservative party, the PP ruled by Mariano Rajoy, is riding high in the polls. But . it could come after Spain's yields on 10 year bonds break the critical 7 . per cent barrier, which forced Ireland, Portugal and Greece to be . bailed out by the eurozone. The interest rate currently stands at a dangerous 6.39 per cent. A historian of the Catholic church with close ties to the Vatican, Andrea Riccardi, was named minister of international and domestic cooperation, a choice that seemed to reward pro-Vatican lawmakers in Parliament. A Monti government is 'an historic and significant turn of events', said Francesco Rutelli of the pro-Vatican centrists. Still, his choices raised some eyebrows. Critics have pointed out that Italy will . now be governed by a band of 'non elected pipe smoking and tweed . wearing university dons' - although Monti does have the backing of all . the major Italian political parties. 'This government, ties to banks, to business, to the Vatican, to private universities - to the usual names - is the opposite of what this country needs,' said Paolo Ferrero, leader of Rifondazione Comunista, a tiny, far-left party. Passera also sits on the board of directors of Milan's Bocconi University, which forms Italy's business elite. Monti is currently the head of the Bocconi. But analysts gave Monti's selections a top mark, insisting the Cabinet ministers were independent.'I think the quality of the people is very high,' said Roberto D'Alimonte, a political science professor at Rome's LUISS University. 'All these people are very high-caliber, and highly respected, independent.' Italy's economy is hampered by high wage costs, low productivity, fat government payrolls, excessive taxes, choking bureaucracy and low numbers of college graduates. But Monti says Italy can beat the crisis if its largely polarized citizenry - often bitterly divided over Berlusconi's long tenure - can pull together. He has also met with union leaders and business representatives. 'I hope that, governing well, we can make a contribution to the calming and the cohesion of the political forces,' Monti told reporters. The head of Italy's largest union confederation, Susanna Camusso, backed Monti but hoped he 'won't put his priority on pensions'. Parliament on Saturday voted to raise the retirement age as part of an austerity package to 67 by 2026 and 70 by 2050, but critics say those reforms are meaningless because they are so far in the future. The new changes also call for the sale of state property and privatizing some services but contain no painful labor reforms. They also offer tax incentives to companies that hire young workers to fight Italy's 25 percent unemployment rate for people ages 15 to 24. The shift in power away from career politicians had caused bickering within Berlusconi's conservative People of Freedom Party, which eventually endorsed Monti. But Berlusconi's main coalition ally, the Northern League, has announced it will stay in the opposition during Monti's government. Out of sight: A torn poster of outgoing Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi's People of Freedom party reads 'Ready to double. Thank you Berlusconi' Rutelli predicted on Sky TG24 TV that Monti's government would win the confidence votes and last until the end of the legislature in spring 2013, to the dismay of many of Berlusconi's allies, who want elections in a few months. 'The economic crisis won't be solved in a brief time,' he noted. Not everyone was enthusiastic about an unelected, technocratic government. 'When governments of technocrats are needed, it means democracy and politics are considered useless, so it's something negative that has to be for a limited period of time,' said skeptic Giuseppe Drago on the streets of Rome. Greece's new government was . today expected to easily survive a vote of confidence, despite cracks . already appearing in the crisis coalition. New Prime Minister Lucas Papademos will then face the daunting . task repairing the shattered public finances.

"By . James Slack and Hugo Gye . Last updated at 3:25 PM on 16th November 2011 . Former head of the UK Border Force Brodie Clark gives evidence to MPs investigating the row over UK border checks . Ministers were unaware that immigration controls had been relaxed to ease airport queues, the former head of the UK Border Force admitted today. The news comes on the day the Mail exclusively revealed that a bombshell inquiry has found that Brodie Clark relaxed checks in clear defiance of ministers because he wanted ‘quick wins’ to speed passengers through airports. Speaking to the BBC Today programme this morning, Mr Clark said he was 'surprised' that ministers had not been told of a decision to relax fingerprint checks on foreign nationals coming through Heathrow at busy times. However, he also admitted there was 'no evidence' that Home Secretary Theresa May, or any other minister, had been informed of the plan. The former borders chief, who has resigned over the furore, told Radio 4 that the decision to relax checks had been made by Heathrow officials, but added: 'It seemed to me a very sensible decision.' He said he assumed someone had informed the Government of the plan, but when asked whether there was any evidence of this he said: 'There is no such evidence.' And while Mrs May later forbade Mr Clark from relaxing fingerprint checks on foreigners who need visas to enter the UK, he claimed today that he approved the Heathrow plan because 'she hadn't made her view clear on secure ID'. A leaked draft copy of a disciplinary investigation into the conduct of Mr Clark – who yesterday denied being a ‘rogue’ civil servant – reveals fingerprint checks on foreign nationals who need a visa to enter the UK were relaxed on 164 occasions. This was despite the Home Secretary explicitly saying that, even 'in extremis’, this must not happen in case it allowed those from terrorist hotspots such as the Yemen to enter unchecked. Staff also casually referred to a . pilot scheme authorised by Theresa May – which did controversially relax checks . on EU biometric passports and children travelling with their parents or . on school trips – as ‘children and chips’. But . the investigation, by former police officer David Wood, concludes Mr . Clark – who yesterday denied any wrongdoing in a dramatic appearance . before MPs – had a ‘case to answer’ that he had broken the Civil Service . Code. Had . he not resigned, this could have led to his dismissal. The report by Mr . Wood, the UK Border Agency’s head of enforcement and crime, which is . likely to be published next week, supports Mrs May’s claim that Mr Clark . had relaxed border checks without her approval. Mr Clark has said this claim was ‘wrong’ – putting Mrs May’s career on the line by implying she had misled Parliament. The internal inquiry, one of three into the scandal, paints a picture of how the civil service threw open the UK’s borders. But . it is the confirmation that Mr Clark did not have approval to go . further, by relaxing visa checks on non-EU nationals, that will be most . significant at Westminster and be seen as vindication of David Cameron’s . decision to back Mrs May. The report – titled ‘formal misconduct procedures’ – makes clear that Mr Clark had been agitating since January this year for the Government to relax border controls and was looking for ‘quick wins’ to prevent chaos at airports. He initially suggested three measures: not routinely opening the biometric chips on passports belonging to EU nationals; not routinely checking the fingerprints of foreign nationals requiring a visa and not routinely checking the documents of EU children travelling with their parents or on a school trip. Giving evidence: Brodie Clark (facing the panel) speaking during a Home Affairs Select Committee meeting in the House of Commons, London . Suspended: Home Secretary Theresa May suspended Clark, claiming he went further than what she had agreed to, local media reported . Immigration . Minister Damian Green’s office initially said he may be content to . support the proposals but wanted more details of their impact. In . April, Mr Clark was sent a response from Mrs May’s office saying . neither she nor Mr Green was ‘content to agree’ to the changes. The report then highlights an e-mail from Mr Clark to a senior official in the Border Agency which lays bare his concerns that Mrs May will not do what he wants. Home Secretary Theresa May leaving 10 Downing Street yesterday . It says: ‘I am now very concerned . about the impact of the summer pressures at the border. I am of the view . that procedural changes will not be in place in time for the main . pressure period. ‘I have little confidence that the Home Secretary will sign-off the changes (in time/at all) and  we seem to have lost some of the urgency around getting this dealt with.’ A string of further emails are exchanged between Mr Clark’s office and Mrs May’s. One, dated July 19, tells Mr Clark: ‘I can confirm you do not have authorisation to go to scenario 3 (suspending fingerprint checks) in any circumstances.’ Mr Clark later asks again if he could move to ‘Level 3’ in ‘absolute extremis’. He was informed on July 26 the answer was that he could not – ‘in any circumstances’. The report goes on to detail how senior staff had informed Mr Clark that they had taken ‘additional measures’ which went beyond those authorised by ministers. On two occasions, details of these ‘additional measures’ were included in weekly reports for ministers – but they ‘remained with Brodie Clark’s Private Office’ and were not sent to Mrs May or Mr Green. The scandal was finally uncovered after a visit by John Vine, chief inspector of immigration, to Heathrow Airport. He alerted Mr Clark’s superiors, who quizzed him about what had been happening. At this point, the report says Mr Clark conceded that checks on fingerprints for those needing a visa had been suspended on 164 occasions over the past year – 156 times at Heathrow. One very senior official said he could not ‘possibly understand’ how Mr Clark believed he had the authority for his actions. The report, which is likely to be published next week, concludes that: ‘I am clear that the evidence available would have led to a  recommendation, should BC still be a civil servant, that he has a case to answer in that he has not  met the standards articulated in the various parts of the [Civil Service] Code’. It adds: ‘The Home Secretary authorised a time limited pilot to enable Border Force to move to Level 2 checks [not checking the chips on EU passports or EU children travelling with their families or on school trips against the Warnings Index] when queues became unmanageable, and then only for the period needed. No other reductions in border controls were authorised, even in “absolute extremis”.’","Brodie Clark confesses there is 'no evidence' ministers knew about plans to stop fingerprinting foreigners at Heathrow .

Don Peters, who coached the 1984 U.S. women's Olympic team, has been listed as 'permanently ineligible' for membership by USA Gymnastics, the nation's governing body of the sport. The action means he can no longer work or volunteer at more than 2,000 member clubs across the country. Allegations: Former Olympics gymnastics coach Don Peters, pictured in 1988, has been permanently banned from coaching . The investigation into the 62-year-old comes after newspaper The Orange County Register reported alleged sexual and physical abuse of underage gymnasts. More than a dozen former gymnasts told the newspaper stories of abuse. In a September 25 story, Doe Yamashiro, a former U.S. national team and SCATS member, said Peters began fondling her in 1986, when she was 16, and had sexual intercourse with her when she was 17. As he looks today: Peters has been kicked out of the sport's hall of fame . Peters, who resigned from USA Gymnastics earlier this year, had argued that his banning was 'moot' because he had already relinquished his membership, and his attorney attacked the investigation, according to ABC news. 'The investigator hired by USA Gymnastics tainted and corrupted the interviews of the witnesses against Coach Peters,' attorney Kevin O'Connell claimed. USA Gymnastics is standing by the findings of its hearing panel, which essentially said it believes the allegations of the two now-adult women and decided Peters should be banned, reports ABC News. 'They can remove [Peters] from their corporate Hall of Fame,' Mr O'Connell added, 'but they cannot remove the gold medals from the team he coached'. Peters led the U.S. women's team to a record eight medals in the 1984 Olympics. The . alleged abuse took place in the 1980s and can not be prosecuted under . California law because the statute of limitation has expired. Two . other U.S. gymnastics coaches, Doug Boger and Michael Zapp, have either . been dismissed or terminated from coaching roles after allegations of . sexual and physical abuse surfaced in newspapers.","Don Peters has had his coaching privileges permanently revoked .

It certainly isn’t the first time she has been handed a bouquet – but judging by the Queen’s delighted expression the novelty never wears off. Her Majesty was approached by schoolgirl Martha Campbell as she left a service of celebration yesterday to mark the 400th anniversary of the King James Bible. The service at Westminster Abbey was led by the Archbishop of Canterbury Rowan Williams. The Queen, 85, was joined by the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales. Here you are Your Majesty: Martha Campbell presents her flowers . Dr Williams paid tribute to the ‘extraordinary’ and ‘abiding importance’ of the King James Bible - so named because it was a translation ordered by James I. Early editions were presented at the altar at the service attended by 2,000 people. The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales led around 2,000 worshippers at the service in Westminster Abbey where early editions of the Bible were presented at the altar. Dr Williams told the congregation that the translators would have been 'baffled and embarrassed' by the idea of a perfect translation but had sought instead to convey the 'almost unbearable weight of divine intelligence and love' into the English language. Delight: The Queen with her bouquet . 'The temptation is always there for the modern translator to look for strategies that make the text more accessible - and when that temptation comes, it doesn't hurt to turn for a moment - for some long moments indeed - to this extraordinary text,' he said. The service was attended by senior clerics including the Archbishop of York Dr John Sentamu, the Bishop of London Dr Richard Chartres and Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O'Connor, former head of the Catholic Church in England and Wales. Aversion of the People's Bible, hand-written by more than 22,000 people, formed part of the procession of Bibles to the altar. Organisers said the contributions came from a five-month tour of Britain with visits to the Orkney Islands, the Isle of Man, Jersey, Devon, Whitby, Glasgow, Swansea, Wrexham and London, including verses written by protesters at the Occupy London camp outside St Paul's Cathedral. Celebrities who hand wrote verses included the Prince of Wales, who is patron of the King James Bible Trust, David Cameron and Dr Williams. Other backers included comedian and broadcaster Frank Skinner and the actors Timothy West and Prunella Scales. The congregation also heard a new composition by one of the winners of the King James Bible Trust composition awards, US composer Zachary Wadsworth. The service comes after lectures, educational programmes and theatre performances around the world marking the anniversary of the Bible dubbed the 'DNA of the English language' by broadcaster Melvyn Bragg. The translation was first ordered by James I at Hampton Court Palace in 1604 as he attempted to forge unity between England and Scotland. Ceremony: The Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Prince of Wales led around 2,000 worshippers at the service in Westminster Abbey . Reception: The Prince of Wales with the Archbishop Dr Rowan Williams after the ceremony . The Bible, also known as the Authorised Version, was the work of 54 scholars working in six translation committees - or companies - based in Oxford, Cambridge, and Westminster. The final editing took place in the Jerusalem Chamber of Westminster Abbey where the translators read their new version of the Bible aloud. Expressions in the Bible such as 'the powers that be' 'the apple of his eye' 'signs of the times' and a 'law unto themselves' are still part of the English language. The global impact of its language was famously highlighted when US civil rights campaigner Dr Martin Luther King used its version of Isaiah chapter 40 verses 4-5 in his 1963 'I Have a Dream' speech.

Around 17 tons of marijuana have been seized after the discovery of a tunnel which police said was one of the most significant drug-smuggling passages ever found on the U.S-Mexico border . The tunnel stretched around 400 yards between warehouses in San Diego and Tijuana, was lined with wood supports and equipped with lighting and ventilation systems. Authorities announced the bust at a news conference yesterday near packages of dope festooned with labels of Captain America, Sprite and Bud Light - the coded markings used to identify the owners. A hole lot of pot: A soldier opens the access to the tunnel in Tijuana as others stand guard near packages of marijuana yesterday. The passage and its adjoining warehouses on the U.S-Mexico border contained around 17 tons of the drug . Iconic labels: The packs of marijuana were covered in stickers of action figure Captain America, a Sprite can and a bottle of Bud Light, which were used as codes to identify its owners . About nine tons of marijuana were seized inside a truck and at the warehouse in San Diego's Otay Mesa area, said Derek Benner, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent in charge of investigations in San Diego. Mexican authorities recovered about eight tons south of the border. Photos taken by Mexican authorities show an entry blocked by bundles that were likely stuffed with marijuana, said Paul Beeson, chief of the Border Patrol's San Diego sector. The tunnel was about four feet high and three feet wide. It dropped about 20 feet on the U.S. side. Two men allegedly seen leaving the warehouse in a truck packed with about three tons of pot were pulled over on Tuesday on a highway in suburban La Mesa and arrested. Complex: The entrance to the tunnel in Otay Mesa in southern California which has been described as one of the most sophisticated passages on the U.S-Mexico border . Extensive: Soldiers stand inside the tunnel during a presentation to the media in Tijuana yesterday. The passage was on average about four feet high and three feet wide. It dropped about 20 feet on the U.S. side . High-end operation: The tunnel was lined with wood supports and equipped with lighting and ventilation systems . A California Highway Patrol officer was overwhelmed by the smell, according to a federal complaint. Cesar Beltran and Ruben Gomez each face a maximum penalty of life in prison if convicted of conspiracy to distribute marijuana, said Alana Robinson, chief of the U.S. attorney's narcotics enforcement section in San Diego. They were scheduled to be arraigned today. Cross-border tunnels have proliferated in recent years, but the latest find is one of the more significant, based on the amount of drugs seized. Raids last November on two tunnels linking San Diego and Tijuana netted a combined 50 tons of marijuana on both sides of the border, two of the largest pot busts in U.S. history. Those secret passages were lined with rail tracks, lighting and ventilation. Proud haul: A Drug Enforcement Administration agent and a border patrol officer stand next to some of the 17 tons of the seized marijuana . Gripping find: An Immigration and Customs Enforcement special agent handles a package with a Captain America logo . As U.S. authorities tighten their noose on land, tunnels have emerged as a major tack to smuggle marijuana. Smugglers also use single-engine wooden boats to ferry bales of marijuana up the Pacific Coast and pilot low-flying aircraft that look like motorized hang gliders to make lightning-quick drops across the border. More than 70 tunnels have been found on the border since October 2008, surpassing the number of discoveries in the previous six years. Many are clustered around San Diego, California's Imperial Valley and Nogales, Ariz. California is popular because its clay-like soil is easy to dig with shovels. In Nogales, smugglers tap into vast underground drainage canals. Authorities said they found a drug tunnel Tuesday in Nogales, running from a drain in Mexico to a rented house on the U.S. side. San Diego's Otay Mesa area has the added . draw that there are plenty of warehouses on both sides of the border to . conceal trucks getting loaded with drugs. Its streets hum with . semitrailers by day and fall silent on nights and weekends. Staring them down: Investigators, accompanied by a sniffer dog, examine the hole inside a warehouse in Otay Mesa as they collate all the evidence . Media scrum: Authorities hold a news conference to announce their massive discovery which they say suggests a major Mexican drug cartel was involved . After last November's twin finds, U.S. authorities launched a campaign to alert Otay Mesa warehouse landlords to warning signs. Landlords were told to look for construction equipment, piles of dirt, sounds of jackhammers and the scent of unburned marijuana. U.S. authorities linked the November finds to Mexico's Sinaloa cartel, headed by that country's most-wanted drug lord, Joaquin 'El Chapo' Guzman. The cartel has expanded its sphere of influence to Tijuana in recent years. U.S. authorities said the sophistication of the latest tunnel suggests that a major Mexican drug cartel was involved, but no link has been established.","One of the most significant drug-smuggling passages ever found on U.S-Mexico border .

The mother of the 13-month-old baby whose body was found wrapped in a blanket and dumped in woods has been charged with his murder. Shelby Dasher, 20, was charged with second-degree murder after admitting to police she repeatedly struck her son Tyler in a rage  because he was crying and 'wouldn't lay down, wouldn't go back to sleep'. She also admitted disposing of his body, which was found discarded near a cemetery about a mile from his home on Tuesday, hours after Dasher reported him missing. It followed a frantic four-hour emergency services search for the child. Dasher originally told police she overslept that morning and discovered him gone from his crib when she awoke after claiming she put her son to bed at 10.30pm on Monday night. Robert P. McCulloch, the prosecuting attorney, told reporters at a press conference today: 'At this point, there's no indication that we have that there's anyone else involved other than Miss Dasher.' He said that Dasher arrived home drunk at 2.30am on Tuesday. When her mother left for work at 7.30am, Tyler would not stop crying so she beat him to death. What happened after that is 'a bit fuzzy', according to what she told prosecutors. Homicide: Tyler Dasher died from blunt force trauma to the head and body . Confession: Shelby Dasher said she had been drinking until 2.30am and when her mother left for work at 7.30am, she then beat her son in a rage. Everything after that was 'fuzzy' she said . Scene: Police launched a frantic search for Tyler after he was reported 'missing' by his mother Shelby . Police and the FBI mounted a massive search while questioning the mother. They noted there was no forced entry to the home. Tyler's father, Joe Ellington, lives elsewhere in the St Louis area. Mr . McCulloch said the child died of blunt-force trauma to the head and . body. He said that 'as far as we know' Dasher carried the body to the . cemetery herself. He said officials are not aware of any prior acts of abuse. Yesterday an area near the cemetery was cordoned off with yellow police tape as force dogs sniffed the ground. A cluster of young adults cried and hugged as they looked on. A candlelit vigil and one minute of . silence will be held for Tyler at 6.45pm today. Several Facebook pages . have been set  up in his memory.

A 79-year-old man died after a nurse mistakenly gave him a drug used in state executions rather than an over-counter medicine. Richard Smith was admitted to hospital in Miami, Florida, after complaining of stomach pains and shortness of breath. The former teacher was prescribed Pepcid, an over-the-counter antacid, to try and cure the problem. Dead: Richard Smith, 79, was admitted to hospital in Miami, Florida, after complaining of stomach pains and shortness of breath . But nurse Uvo Ologboride picked up a vial of Pancuronium from a locked drug cart and injected it into the former teacher's IV tube. The drug is given to death row inmates being put to death. It is a muscle relaxant that forms part of the three injections used in state executions. The drug is also used in operating rooms. An investigation by officials at the North Shore Medical Centre found that Mr Smith was left alone for 30 minutes after being given the wrong drug.

Mr Smith, a father-of-four, was resuscitated but never recovered, and died weeks later. An investigation into the incident in July 2010 revealed the nurse on duty failed to read the label, failed to scan the medication and failed to scan Mr Smith's patient ID bracelet. Officials said this would have alerted the nurse of the mistake before it happened. Scene: An investigation by officials at the North Shore Medical Centre found Mr Smith was left alone for 30 minutes after being given the wrong drug . A report also said the nurse failed to follow safeguards on a drug dispensing cart to prevent these types of incidents. Details of the mix up were revealed by the Smith family as they filed a lawsuit against the Florida hospital. The victim's son Marc said he arrived at the hospital to be told about the mix up by a doctor. Marc recalled the doctor said: 'I'm sorry to have to tell you this, but the nurse administered the wrong medication.' Days gone by: Mr Smith, eventually a father-of-four, was resuscitated but never recovered, and died weeks later . ‘I said: “How could that happen, didn't he read it?” He said: “The nurse said the package looked the same”,’ Marc added.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 5:58 PM on 16th November 2011 . France and Germany, Europe's two central powers, clashed today over whether the European Central Bank should intervene to halt the eurozone's accelerating debt crisis - as modest bond purchases failed to stop the rout. Facing rising borrowing costs as its AAA credit rating comes under threat, France appeared to plead for stronger ECB action, adding to mounting global pressure spelled out by U.S. President Barack Obama. Bond market contagion is spreading across Europe. Italian 10-year bond yields have risen above 7 per cent, unaffordable in the long term. Action: U.S. President Barack Obama (left during . his Australian visit) has again called for more decisive action from EU . leaders, as European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso (right) said the eurozone faced a systemic crisis and fragmentarion was not the . answer . Yields on bonds issued by France, the Netherlands and Austria - which along with Germany form the core of the euro zone - have also climbed. 'The ECB's role is to ensure the stability of the euro, but also the financial stability of Europe. We trust that the ECB will take the necessary measures to ensure financial stability in Europe,' government spokeswoman Valerie Pecresse said after a cabinet meeting in Paris. Pecresse said Paris believed the risk premium investors charge to hold French debt rather than safe haven 10-year German Bunds 'is not justified'. That 'spread' hit a euro era peak of 195 basis points today. But German Chancellor Angela Merkel made clear Berlin would resist pressure for the central bank to take a bigger role in resolving the debt crisis, saying European Union rules prohibited such action. 'The way we see the treaties, the ECB doesn't have the possibility of solving these problems,' she said after talks with visiting Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny. The only way to recover markets' confidence was to implement agreed economic reforms and build a closer European political union by changing the EU treaty, Merkel said. Intervention: The European Central Bank today stepped in to stem an accelerating sell-off of euro zone government bonds after the U.S. called for more decisive action to halt a spreading sovereign debt crisis . ECB policymakers continue to reject international calls to intervene decisively as Europe's lender of last resort, stressing it is up to governments to resolve the debt crisis through austerity measures and reforms. Traders said the central bank bought Spanish and Italian bonds on Wednesday, but the respite was short-lived and there was no sign of a change in the ECB's policy of limited, stop-go purchases to calm markets temporarily while maintaining pressure on governments. In Rome, Prime Minister-designate Mario Monti unveiled a government of technocrats, taking the key economy portfolio for himself in a drive to implement long delayed structural economic reforms and austerity measures. Fears for the French economy are growing as the yields on its 10 year government's bonds yesterday climbed to 3.63 per cent. With the German equivalent at just . 1.75 per cent, the difference between what it costs Paris and Berlin to . borrow is at its highest level since the euro was established in 1999. Other countries yields stand at: . Greece - 33.30% . Portugal - 11.25% . Ireland - 8.42% . Italy - 7.08% . Spain - 6.39% . France - 3.65% . UK - 2.14% . US - 2.02% . Germany - 1.82% . * as at 5pm GMT Wednesday. Monti, a former European Commissioner, said he hoped markets would be reassured by his team, which features several academics and Intesa bank Chief Executive Corrado Passera, but no politicians. He will present his programme to the Senate on Thursday. Obama, on a visit to Australia, turned up the heat on Europe to act more boldly to extinguish the spreading bushfire. 'Until we put in place a concrete plan and structure that sends a clear signal to the markets that Europe is standing behind the euro and will do what it takes, we are going to continue to see the kinds of market turmoil we saw,' he said. Obama said that whilst there had been progress in putting together unity governments in Italy and Greece, Europe still faced a 'problem of political will'. 'We're going to continue to advise European leaders on what options we think would meet the threshold where markets would settle down. It is going to require some tough decisions on their part,' he said. Unicredit Chief Executive Federico Ghizzoni said he would ask the ECB to increase access to central bank funds for Italian banks, which have faced growing funding problems since Italy was sucked into the debt crisis in July. European Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso told the European Parliament the eurozone faced a systemic crisis and fragmenting the European Union was no solution. He appeared to be referring to calls, notably from French President Nicolas Sarkozy, for a two-speed Europe with a much more integrated euro zone moving ahead of a looser confederation of non-euro members. He said: 'We are indeed now facing a truly systemic crisis that requires an even stronger commitment from all and that may require additional and very important measures. 'We will not make the euro stronger through the fragmentation of the European Union.' New men on the block: Mario Monti (left) is set . to name his new Italian government today, while Greek PM Lucas Papademos . (right) is facing a vote of confidence . In Greece, technocrat Prime Minister Lucas Papademos, a former ECB vice-president, was set to win a big confidence vote in parliament for his interim government despite the refusal of the main conservative leader to sign up to more austerity. New Democracy party chief Antonis Samaras gave Papademos only arms-length backing, refusing to bow to EU demands for a written commitment to the bailout programme and calling for elections in three months to restore social peace. With Papademos' national unity coalition already split, rebuilding Greece's shattered finances to avert default will be a daunting task as Europe battles to prevent its debt woes from dragging down the world economy. With financial markets sceptical that unelected technocrats will have the political clout to impose unpopular reforms, the two-year-old debt crisis still risks engulfing the entire currency bloc and hurting global growth. Today's respite may be short-lived. U.S. policymakers have voiced alarm at growing signs of strain in the money market, the plumbing of the international financial system. Banks in the eurozone face increasing difficulties in obtaining dollar funding, and while the stresses are nowhere near as acute as they were in the 2008 financial crisis, they have continued to mount despite ECB moves to provide unlimited liquidity to banks. Asian shares and the euro fell earlier today as signs that rising borrowing costs were affecting France stirred concern that the debt crisis has spread to the region's core. 'Markets are clearly expecting a circuit breaker to alleviate pressure on periphery bond yields,' said David Scutt, a trader at Arab Bank Australia in Sydney. 'If no announcement is forthcoming in the days ahead, one suspects that the situation could unravel fairly quickly.' U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner said Europe had a difficult task in boosting the creditworthiness of some of its economies while also boosting growth. And a Brussels-based think-tank warning that France's economy should be 'ringing alarm bells', Finance Minister Francois Baroin sought to calm fears about public finances. 'We have the necessary room to manoeuvre within the budget to meet our 2012 deficit target even if the economy slows more than expected,' he said in an interview in Les Echos. 'Even with growth of 0.5 percent we can cope.' Baroin said the government was not working on a third savings package after announcing a second round of belt-tightening in three months last week in order to keep its deficit targets within reach, despite slowing growth. Data on Tuesday showed the economy of the 17-nation euro zone barely grew in the third quarter. ECB President Mario Draghi has predicted the currency bloc will be in a mild recession by the end of the year. Baroin told Les Echos he believed the ECB had an important role to play in calming the debt crisis, but he acknowledged, as did Geithner, that Germany had deep reservations. Many analysts believe the only way to stem the contagion for now is for the European Central Bank to buy large amounts of bonds - effectively the sort of quantitative easing undertaken by the U.S. and British central banks. This has been anathema in Germany. But on Tuesday Peter Bofinger, a member of the group of economists that advises the German government, said the ECB should indeed become the euro zone's lender of last resort if the bloc's debt woes risked tearing apart the financial system. 'If politics can't do it, then the ECB must do all it can to bring interest rates down to more reasonable levels,' Bofinger said at Euro Finance Week.","Bond sell-off panic takes in healthy countries such as Netherlands, Finland and Austria .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Last updated at 1:59 PM on 17th November 2011 . Wanted: Daniel Andreas San Diego, suspected of 2003 terrorist attacks, has been spotted in Massachusetts . A fugitive on the FBI's 'Most Wanted Terrorists' list, linked to two bombings near San Francisco, may be hiding in western Massachusetts. Daniel Andreas San Diego, the first domestic terrorism suspect added to the list, was allegedly involved in bombings at a biotechnology firm and a nutritional products company in California in 2003, the FBI said. He disappeared before being taken into custody after a federal arrest warrant was issued in October 2003. The FBI said San Diego may be in the Northampton area, about 20 miles north of Springfield in the western part of Massachusetts. The bureau bases its intelligence on a recent tip from the TV programme America's Most Wanted. According to the FBI, San Diego has ties to animal rights extremist groups. The bureau is seeking public help to track him down and have offered a reward of up to $250,000 for information leading directly to his arrest. San Diego, originally a California resident, is described by the FBI as a white male, about 33 years old, six feet tall and around 160lb, with brown hair and brown eyes. He has several tattoos, including a large round image of burning hillsides in the center of his chest. Shadowy figure: The FBI believes this person, seen at Chiron Corporation before two explosions in 2003, is San Diego . At the time of his disappearance, San Diego did not eat any meat or any food containing animal products, and the FBI believes he may be preparing vegetarian and vegan foods for sale, as a way of making money. He also may be using his computer networking skills. Early in the morning of August 28, 2003, two homemade bombs exploded one hour apart at Chiron . Corporation, a biotech company, based in Emeryville, California. The FBI believes the second bomb was timed to explode as . emergency services were dealing with the aftermath of the first. Terror attack: One of the two explosions at Chiron Corporation, captured on CCTV. No-one was hurt in either of the bombings . No-one was hurt in either blast. Less than a month later, at 3.22am on September 26, a nail bomb exploded at Shaklee . Corporation, which makes nutritional supplements and eco-friendly . shampoos and lotions - in Pleasanton, Calififornia. No-one was hurt in this bombing either. Both companies had links to Huntingdon Life Company, a company that conducted laboratory . testing on animals. After each of the attacks, an animal rights group called the Revolutionary Cells-Liberation Brigade posted an e-mail taking responsibility for the bombings. It warned Chiron and Shaklee that, if they and others did not sever links to Huntington, the bombs would increase in size and employees' homes and families would become targets. FBI Agents began tracking San Diego, suspecting he might have part of the group. But San Diego must have realised he was being shadowed, as he parked his car in downtown San Francisco on October 6, 2003, and walked away. He never returned to his car and has not been seen since.","Activist targeted companies linked to animal testing .

A professional footballer killed himself over the 'embarrassment' of his fiancee having an affair with the brother of England captain John Terry, an inquest heard today. Dale Roberts, a goalkeeper with Rushden & Diamonds, hanged himself last December at the home he shared with partner Lindsey Cowan in Higham Ferrers, Northamptonshire. The inquest heard how Miss Cowan and Mr Roberts split up briefly after she had an affair with Paul Terry, 32, brother of John, in May 2010. Suicide: Footballer Dale Roberts, left, is said to have hanged himself because of his humiliation at his fiancee Lindsey Cowan, pictured today at the inquest, having had an affair with John Terry's brother Paul . Distraught: Miss Cowan (second, left) is comforted by Mr Roberts's mother Isabelle outside the coroner's court. His father George (right) also attended the hearing . On the evening of her fiancee's death, Miss Cowan said she came home to find a final message from Mr Roberts written on the whiteboard in their kitchen. It said: 'I love Lindsey Elizabeth Cowan very very much she is the love of my life.' Mr Roberts, who also played for the semi-professional national team England C, had become withdrawn after . an injury and begun taking anti-depressants, which left him 'lethargic' and 'lacking motivation'. The . day the 24-year-old was due to make his comeback for Rushden & . Diamonds, he sent a text to his fiancee saying: 'I'm so scared about . playing tonight'. Northamptonshire coroner Anne Pember recorded a verdict of suicide and the cause of death as asphyxia caused by hanging. Manchester . City winger and England star Adam Johnson, a schoolfriend of Mr . Roberts, said the pair had gone on holiday together shortly after rumours of the alleged affair became public. He . said: 'I'm not sure he could deal with the embarrassment the story . caused him. His death was a combination of the negative press and his . leg injury. 'This was a . very sad and tragic conclusion to the life of a wonderful young man who . was a dear friend and he had a great future in the game and my heart . goes out to his family.' Rushden . & Diamonds club doctor Dr John Mellor told the inquest Mr Roberts . came to him for help on November 19, 2010 and he prescribed him . anti-depressants. He saw him several weeks later and he was 'smiling' and 'training as normal', said Dr Mellor. Mr Roberts's mother Isabelle revealed that Miss Cowan and her son had been at school together in Peterlee and had been in a relationship for the past six years. 'Betrayal': Paul Terry, left, brother of England star John, right, stayed on the couple's sofa occasionally before allegedly having an affair with Miss Cowan . She said he was 'really upset' after reports of his fiancee's affair with Terry made the newspapers. 'He phoned us and said Lindsey had been having an affair with Paul Terry and gave strict instructions not to speak to the press. 'He was really upset because he gave him his couch and trusted him.' In September, Mr Roberts became depressed after injuring his leg while playing for England C and began missing training at Rushden & Diamonds. His mother added: 'I found him down and depressed, he had been missing training and not turning up at the club. 'He had began suffering panic attacks and said he couldn't go to Asda. 'I believe it was because he thought people recognised him and was worried about what people would say.' Miss Cowan, 26, told the hearing that Paul Terry stayed at their house 'from time to time' but that after they got back together they were able to laugh and joke about it. Torn apart: Mr Roberts and his fiancee in happier times, left, and Miss Cowan with his mother at court . Shortly before his death he was avoiding training and his team-mates, she added. She said: 'He began crying, he said he couldn't go to training because he couldn't be bothered anymore. 'He kept saying over and over ""my body can't take it"" and was very lethargic and wanted to sleep. 'Dale told him [his agent Cyrille Regis] Justin [Edinburgh, his manager] had shouted at him and said, ""if you were my son I would kick you up the backside"". Dale said he asked for a counsellor but did not get one.' He received a text message the night before he died from Mr Edinburgh telling him he was to start the game the following day. The next morning he sent Miss Cowan a text . message saying that he was scared. His body was found 3.30pm after . police were told he had not attended pre-match training an hour and a . half before. Mr Edinburgh told the inquest his player 'had no motivation'. Stunned: The inquest was also attended by Rushden & Diamonds manager Justin Edinburgh, left, who said his player had 'no motivation' and by Manchester City footballer Adam Johnson, a friend of Mr Roberts . He said: 'He was quite distant. Dale wasn't the greatest communicator off the pitch. He was such a nice lad, I wish I could have done more to have stopped this.' Mr Roberts's mother stormed out of the inquest as the manager gave his evidence. Club physio Harry Bedford told the inquest Mr Roberts had suffered palpitations and had distanced himself from other players shortly before his death. Coroner Anne Pember said: 'From the evidence I believe at the time when he was feeling low and depressed he made a decision he no longer wanted to live.' Outside the court a statement was read out by Mr Roberts's parents, George and Isabelle. It read: 'We wish to thank everyone for their help and support and and kindness over the past year. It's been a difficult time for everyone concerned but the love and support we've been shown has helped us during this difficult time.' Mr Roberts joined Rushden & Diamonds in January 2009 and had loan spells with Eastwood Town and Alfreton Town while on the books at Championship side Nottingham Forest. Forest's chief executive Mark Arthur described Dale as a 'talented' goalkeeper with a 'highly promising career' and said his death was a tragedy. Paul Terry - who was given a free transfer to Darlington after the alleged affair emerged, and now plays for Thurrock - did not attend the inquest. He is married to the Leicester City left-back Paul Konchesky's sister Sarah.","Dale Roberts killed himself at the home he shared with Lindsey Cowan .

He's surged to become one of the most talked-about politicians in the U.S. Now as New Jersey Governor Chris Christie prepares to make a final decision on whether to run for president, a poll revealed he is almost in a dead heat with Barack Obama for the White House. But even though he is developing into the most popular contender, critics are threatening to take his legs away before he has even started running by saying he is simply too fat to become president. Decision time: As New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, left, prepares to make a final call on whether to run for president, a poll revealed he is almost in a dead heat with Barack Obama, right, for the White House . President Obama is now backed by 44 per cent of likely voters and Governor Christie is a whisker behind with the support of 43 per cent, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll released today. Age: 49 . Home: Mendham, New Jersey . Job: New Jersey Governor . Political affiliation: Republican party . Marital status: Married to Mary Pat with four children . Likes: Bruce Springsteen, New York Mets and American Idol . Dislikes: MTV's Jersey Shore . Famous quote: 'Get the hell off the beach' (to New Jersey hurricane surfers last month) Governor Christie is expected to make a decision on whether to run this weekend, as he reportedly already has the backing of his family, many senior GOP figures and big-spending donors. But commentators and influential figures are circling around Governor . Christie over the issue of his weight, with some suggesting he is . simply too fat for president and others joking that he goes on the ‘Al . Sharpton Jailhouse Diet’. Reverend Al Sharpton, who has himself suggested a presidential run in the past, pulled off a hunger strike in 2001 during a 90-day prison sentence for trespassing on a U.S. Navy base. Family: Governor Christie and his family prepare to lay a white roses on wreckage pulled from Ground Zero during a memorial dedication on September 10 this year in Jersey City, New Jersey . 'Most of what we eat is what we think we want,' Reverend Sharpton joked on MSNBC. 'So what I think we should do is put Governor Christie in jail for 90 days.' Grover Cleveland (1885-1889) - 250lbs . Food fanatic President Cleveland once wrote: 'I must go to dinner, but I wish it was to eat a pickled herring a Swiss cheese and a chop at Louis' instead of the French stuff I shall find.' Warren Harding (1921-1923) - 200lbs . Keen musician but heavy smoker President Harding was born in Ohio and died in California of a heart attack, aged only 57. He suffered from high blood pressure. Presenter Joe Scarborough suggested that could be called the 'Al Sharpton Jailhouse Diet'. Bloomberg political commentator Michael Kinsley suggested that being fat could actually benefit Governor Christie by ‘authenticating his portrayal of Everyman (who) is sick to death of Washington’. But he added: ‘The symbolism of Christie’s weight problem goes way past the issue of obesity itself. ‘It is just a too-perfect symbol of our country at the moment, with appetites out of control and discipline near zilch. And it’s not just symbolism. We don’t yet know much about Chris Christie.’ Noel Sheppard of Newsbusters also pointed out that obese liberals New York Congressman Jerry Nadler and film-maker Michael Moore have not received so much focus on their weight. Governor Christie has come under intense pressure from the GOP to run because many are doubtful whether any current Republican candidates will be good enough to challenge President Obama. He is seen as the most electable of all . because of his no-nonsense approach, epitomised when he told surfers to . ‘get the hell off the beach’ before Hurricane Irene struck the East . Coast in August. Jokes: MSNBC presenter Joe Scarborough suggested that Reverend Al Sharpton's idea of 'putting Governor Christie in jail for 90 days' could be called the 'Al Sharpton Jailhouse Diet' Martin Bashir of MSNBC said the GOP is making out Governor Christie as ‘the great white hope’ - a reference to 1970 boxing film ‘The Great White Hope’, with James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander. But Rasmussen Reports president Scott Rasmussen said: ‘As Rick Perry has recently demonstrated, it’s easier being on the outside with people begging you to run than it is to actually run a campaign. ‘Running for president is a unique role in America, and there’s no way of knowing how a candidate will perform unless they actually try it.’ New challenger? President Obama is now backed by 44 per cent of likely voters and Governor Christie is a whisker behind with the support of 43 per cent, according to a Rasmussen Reports poll . Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote: ‘Chris Christie needs to find some way to lose weight. Like everyone else, elected officials perform best when they are in optimal health. 'Chris Christie needs to find some way . to lose weight. Like everyone else, elected officials perform best when . they are in optimal health' Eugene Robinson, Washington Post . ‘Christie’s weight is as legitimate an issue as the smoking habit that President Obama says he has finally kicked,’ he added, before advising Governor Christie to ‘eat a salad and take a walk’. Governor Christie told CNN in June that he has been ‘really struggling’ for a long time with his weight and feels ‘a sense of guilt at times’ about not getting it under control for the sake of his children. He was hospitalised for asthma soon after that interview and admitted he needed to lose weight – with National Institutes of Health estimates appearing to show he is ‘extremely obese’. Comparison: Martin Bashir of MSNBC said the GOP is making out Governor Christie as 'the great white hope' - a reference to 1970 boxing film 'The Great White Hope', starring James Earl Jones and Jane Alexander . Fewer jokes: One political commentator pointed out that obese liberals New York Congressman Jerry Nadler and film-maker Michael Moore, pictured, have not received so much focus on their weight . Governor Christie - who was viewed favourably overall in the poll - has already received the backing of former first lady Nancy Reagan, secretary of state Henry Kissinger and president George W. Bush. More than half of GOP voters have a favourable opinion of Governor Christie - although 35 per cent of likely voters still have no opinion on him, reported the New York Post. Ex-Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney would get 44 per cent to President Obama’s 42 per cent.","New Jersey Governor Chris Christie 'to decide whether to run this weekend'

"By . Becky Barrow . Last updated at 3:22 PM on 4th October 2011 . 'I doubt you will find a better offer than this anywhere else in the public sector,' said union boss Bob Crow . Tube drivers yesterday won a pay deal to boost their average salary to more than £50,000 a year. The inflation-busting award comes at a time when millions of workers are seeing only paltry rises, or even pay freezes. The London Underground drivers will be on almost twice the national average full-time salary of around £26,000. Under the four-year deal, negotiated by militant union bosses at the Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers' union, staff will get a 5 per cent pay rise this year. For the subsequent three years, they will get a pay rise equal to the retail prices index measure of inflation plus 0.5 percentage points. That would mean a rise of 4.5 per cent if RPI is 4 per cent next year. If the index slides, they are still guaranteed a 2 per cent lift. In a further boost, the pay deal comes on top of a bonus of up to £1,800 – a one-off £500 payment plus overtime for work during next summer's Olympic games. Transport for London said the agreement rules out pay strikes until at least 2015 – although other issues may lead to industrial action. Tory MP Dominic Raab said: 'At a time of financial restraint for businesses and families, this is daylight robbery that will cost users and taxpayers dearly.' Off the rails: Some drivers will get a £10,000 pay increase under the new agreement . Emma Boon of the TaxPayers' Alliance said: 'Taxpayers will be left fuming that bullyboy tactics have been rewarded with such a generous deal. 'The size of this inflation-busting pay increase is insulting to commuters who have faced the misery of repeated tube strikes in recent years.' Over the past year, just one in every 25 workers secured a pay deal worth 5 per cent or more, according to an authoritative analysis by the pay experts XpertHR. The average for the private sector worker was 2.3 per cent. Industry sources said Eurostar drivers . earn around £53,000, while drivers on the East Coast Mainline earn . around £50,000. Virgin Train counterparts get around £48,000. Bob Crow, the hardline general . secretary of the RMT, who earns £84,000 plus benefits, said: 'In these . days of austerity, we have shown that fighting trade unionism is the . best defence from attacks on jobs and living standards. 'I doubt you will find a better offer anywhere else in the public sector.' But Andrew Cave, of the Federation of Small Businesses, said: 'Small business owners will view this deal with astonishment. 'Many have stopped paying themselves a wage in order to keep existing members of staff.' Mike Brown, managing director of London Underground, insisted the pay deal was fair and affordable. The calculation of a Tube driver's . average salary is based on the current level of £42,500, plus official . inflation estimates from the Office for Budget Responsibility.","Wage is double UK average after inflation-busting rise .

A music teacher is on a mission to save a famous Yorkshire song claiming most young people in the region don't know the tune or the words. Traditional folk song On Ilkla Moor Baht 'at - said to mean on Ilkley Moor without a hat - is regarded as part of Yorkshire's heritage. But Gordon Eddison, 55, from Otley, West Yorkshire, was shocked to discover that very few children have heard of the song. Scroll down to hear the song . The hills are alive! Gordon Eddison conducts members of Otley Brass Band in a rendition of the famous song whose words and tune Gordon is trying to preserve for future generations . Now he has vowed to re-introduce the Victorian anthem back into hearts and minds across the region and has launched a campaign to preserve it. Mr Eddison, who is also Otley Brass Band's conductor, said when he asked youngsters if they knew the words, they either had no knowledge of it at all, and one child asked: 'Did Muse record it?' He added: 'This cannot go on. We owe it to our Yorkshire Heritage . to preserve this song in the minds of our young people and not let it . be relegated to words on a novelty tea-towel. 'Singing is vital to . our children’s musical and social education, parents and grandparents . should immediately put this right, teach them to sing On Ilkla Moor Baht . ‘at now.' Anecdotally, Mr Eddison believes only 10 per cent of children know what the song is. He thinks parents and grandparents might think their children are taught the song in school, but they're not.

"By . Jessica Satherley . Last updated at 1:56 AM on 18th November 2011 . Georgina Edmonds was 'brutally murdered' inside her cottage in Brambridge, Hampshire . The son of a pensioner who was tortured for her credit card pin number and bludgeoned to death told a court today how he found her beaten body in a pool of blood at her country home. Grandmother Georgina Edmonds was ‘brutally murdered’ in January 2008 inside her cottage in Brambridge, Hampshire, by electrician Matthew Hamlen, 33, the prosecution allege. Her son, Harry Edmonds, who runs a coffee importing company, described how he had a feeling of ‘foreboding’ as he arrived at his mother's cottage. He explained that his family lived in the main house of Kingfisher Lodge while his mother had moved into the adjacent cottage a few years previously. He told the jury at Winchester Crown Court that as he arrived at her home after work on Friday January 11, it was in darkness. He said: 'I was struck by the fact it all looked so dark, it seemed to be a foreboding atmosphere, I was conscious of it.' He explained that he had intended to see his 77-year-old mother to show her some photographs of his son acting in a play for which he had won an award. When he went to the cottage, he believed that she was asleep so he rang the phone so as not to give her a fright. But he said that when she did not respond, he became concerned and decided to climb into her bedroom through a window that he managed to open. At the same time, two groundsmen, Ian Wrightson and Bob Whale, who he had alerted by phone, also arrived. Mr Edmonds said: 'I heard voices coming from the main door and I looked across and it was Ian coming in but there was no Granny. Crime scene: Georgina Edmonds was found stabbed and battered to death at her home on January 11 2008 in Otterbourne, South Hampshire, (police seen at the scene) 'I saw some legs on the floor, 'My God', I thought, 'This is terrible, she's had an accident'. 'I said 'Put the light on' and there was Granny lying on the ground, flat on her face and there was a huge pool of blood coming out from under her head and unfortunately because it was dark I had trodden in this. 'I realised I had been treading these bloody footprints into the carpet.' Mr Edmonds said that he called 999 and told the operator: 'I think there's been a murder here.' He told the court: 'She was clearly dead, she wasn't moving and there was a huge pool of blood. 'I didn't touch her because I know you do not touch a crime scene and there was a big dent in her head and she had clearly received a blow or blows of sorts.' He said that after a wait, an ambulance crew arrived and confirmed the death with police arriving a while later. Brutal murder: A man tortured the frail pensioner for her credit card PIN number before bludgeoning her to death in a frenzied attack at her cottage (pictured) Michael Bowes QC, prosecuting, told the jury yesterday: 'The many knife wounds penetrated Georgina Edmonds's skin. Their pattern suggests they had been inflicted with some deliberation rather than a significant degree of force. 'Given the theft of her credit card and its unsuccessful use hours later, the inference is she was tortured in order to obtain her pin and then beaten to death.' Describing his mother, Mr Edmonds said: 'My mother was a fairly lively character, she had led an active life, she always had a couple of dogs and was fastidious about giving them a good walk in the morning and afternoon.' He explained that she suffered from osteoporosis and had had several hip replacements. He said: 'She never complained, she was always a positive, happy person.' The trial has heard that Mrs Edmonds was stabbed several times with a knife by her killer who tortured her to force her to reveal her bank card pin number. She was also hit over the head with a marble rolling pin from the kitchen where her body was found. Hamlen, from Eastleigh, Hampshire, denies murder. The trial continues.","Georgina Edmonds, 77, was found in her kitchen by her son Harry .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 3:32 PM on 18th November 2011 . Anti-capitalist protesters took over an empty office building owned by investment bank UBS last night. It is the latest defiance from Occupy London protesters who announced yesterday they would legally challenge 24 hour eviction legal notices pinned to their tents outside St Paul's Cathedral. A group of around 30 protesters got into the three storey office block in the heart of London's financial district with Occupy London taking responsibility on its website today. Occupy UBS: Protestors today in the three-storey office block in London, they say taking over the building is part of 'public repossession' The anti capitalist movement said it took over the abandoned office block in the neighborhood of . Hackney in a 'public repossession' overnight. Yesterday evening members of the group, stood in the . windows looking down on Sun Street, the City of London, which is . opposite another UBS building. One, with his face covered, tied . himself to a window frame with rope and sat on the ledge. When asked how . they got in, one of the protesters replied: 'Magic.' Armed police and a police helicopter . were at the scene of the occupation, which is close to a similar . occupation in Finsbury Square. Members of the group held a press conference on the ground floor with the press where they said they pledged they would be there round the clock. Take over: An Occupy London protestor, clad in hard hard, can be seen sitting on the window ledge today . 'Welcome room': A man plays a ukulele and a lady holds a child inside the UBS building, protesters took over the three-storey office block yesterday evening . They sat cross legged on the floor in front of a huge banner which read 'Occupy London'. Speaking about why they were occupying the disused building, one demonstrator, who wished to be named as Franklyn, 36, said: . 'UBS did gamble with pensioner's . money and they lost a lot of money so there are some real issues that . are global in terms of the economy. 'And it's the pensioners that are going to be hit the hardest.' The group said they were due to hold . the first national conference of the Occupy movement on Saturday from . the site in Sun Street and promised more people would be joining them. They told reporters they planned to use the space as a 'Bank of Ideas' to hold workshops and political discussions. Near and far: Banners put up by the protestors and, right, preparing this morning . Asked whether they were worried about . eviction Pete Phoenix, 41, part of the Squatters Action Housing Group, . said: 'We are not particularly worried. 'We are occupying the space at the moment and before the police come there would have to be a court case. 'We're here on behalf of the . pensioners who lost money. We hope to talk to UBS and the police. We're . very happy to negotiate and hope sense can be seen.' Speaking about why they were . occupying the disused building, a demonstrator who wished not to be . named, said: 'When the UBS security guards were yelling at us we said we . would give it back if they gave back the billion dollars the stole from . pensioners. He added: 'We've got more people joining us from the rest of the UK and Ireland tomorrow.' Inside: Demonstrators from the Occupy movement give a news conference inside the building today . You've been served: A bailiff pins an eviction notice to a tent outside St Paul's Cathedral . Time to leave: Bailiffs acting for the Corporation of London handed out eviction notices to the tents at the City Of London site . The City of London Corporation had . told the protesters to move tents and equipment from the public highway . by 6pm last night or face High Court action. But . instead of packing up, protesters were discussing putting up Christmas . decorations as they prepare for a lengthy legal battle. Bailiffs had tied notes to some of the 200 tents pitched in the churchyard telling activists to leave or face High Court action. But protesters vowed to continue and a sign on one of the tents yesterday declared: ‘Hell, no – we won’t go!’ The notice was issued a day after U.S. police cleared the Occupy Wall Street camp in New York. But lawyers warn the situation is more complex here due to human rights laws and the eviction could drag on for months. The Corporation had halted earlier court action to hold talks with protesters. But policy chairman Stuart Fraser said the negotiations went ‘nowhere’. Naomi Colvin, for Occupy London, insisted earlier this week the eviction ‘was not something we need to be remotely worried about’. She added: ‘It could take months. We will contest it.’ Legal threat: The warning notice handed out to protesters . The Mail told last month how thermal imaging cameras showed the camp virtually empty at night. Even if the court action succeeds, the protest is likely be continue in the churchyard during the day as long as nobody pitches tents. Adam Chapman, head of public law at Kingsley Napley, said the Human . Rights Act would make evicting London protesters a far more complex . affair. Before deciding . whether to give the go-ahead to the eviction, a judge would have to . consider Article 10, which covers freedom of expression, and Article 11, . freedom of assembly, he said. ‘Any judgment would hinge on whether the interference with those rights is ""proportionate"". Deadline passed: The anti-capitalist protesters did have the option of leaving voluntarily - but not one person has gone home . ‘The . protesters have in their favour that St Paul’s remains open and so . there is not a massive amount of disruption to the normal use of the . land. ‘The Corporation of . London also needs to decide if is just trying to remove the camp, or to . stop the protest altogether, which would be much more difficult. ‘It is likely that we could get a . situation where, even after the removal of the tents, protests are . allowed to continue outside St Paul’s during the day.’ He said there were likely to be . similarities with the attempts to evict the protesters camped in . Parliament Square which began in May 2010 but only concluded ten months . later in March this year. On patrol: Police officers walk among protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday . The anti-capitalist protest at the Cathedral is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy. Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul’s since October 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed. The City of London Corporation halted earlier court action to hold talks with protest organisers aimed at finding a compromise that would allow the demonstrators to remain at the site until January if they removed some of the tents. After a humiliating . internal row within the church which led to two high profile . resignations, St Paul’s Cathedral decided not to join the legal action . against the protesters. A spokeswoman for St Paul’s said earlier this week: ‘We recognise the local authority’s statutory right to proceed with the action. ‘We . have always desired a peaceful resolution and the Canons will continue . to hold regular meetings with representative of the protesters.’","Around 30 activists took over three-storey office building yesterday evening .

John Stone was a mine expert who carried out a daring reconnaissance mission of the Normandy beaches just before the D-Day landings. Hero: John Stone, a D-Day hero whose bravery helped change the course of World War Two has died . Wearing dark clothing, he crept up the beach and got to within 40 yards of German soldiers while he examined deadly bombs they had laid. He discovered wooden poles with anti-tank mines on top positioned along the shoreline that would have been hidden at high tide and devastated landing craft. Upon his return to England he was debriefed and his intelligence made Winston Churchill and Dwight D Eisenhower change the invasion from high to low tide to avoid the traps. Daring: Stone crept up the beach and got to within 40 yards of German soldiers while he examined deadly obstacles the Germans had laid . As a result thousands more soldiers made it safely to shore along the five Normandy beaches on D-Day, giving the Allies a strong foothold on Nazi-occupied Europe. For his bravery Mr Stone, who was a 22-year-old Sapper Lieutenant, was awarded the Military Cross. He also received a congratulatory telegram from Winston Churchill. After leaving the army, Mr Stone worked as a consultant engineer before retiring to Weymouth, Dorset. He recently developed prostate cancer and passed away at his home aged 89. He died on November 10 and the following day, Armistice Day, his daughter Tomina attended a Remembrance Day service in honour of her father. In an interview he gave in 2004, Mr Stone recalled the mission he carried out with a sergeant and a corporal. Aircraft reconnaissance photos had revealed suspected staked mines on the beaches but army chiefs needed to know what kind they were. His team was taken by motor torpedo boat across the Channel and they then got into a dinghy to make their way ashore at night-time. Escorted by commandos, the three engineers crept up the beach to inspect the defences. Mr Stone said: ‘It did not all go to plan. When we got into our dinghy it capsized and we had to wade the rest of the way.’ He added: ‘We saw sentries patrolling and we got to within about 40 yards of one smoking a cigarette. ‘A searchlight passed over us several times, but they never saw us.’ The group identified the mines as anti-tank devices. Mr Stone said: ‘If they had gone in at high tide it would have knocked the bottom of the landing craft out and sunk them before they got to the beaches. ‘As I understand it, the information we brought back led to the timing of D-Day being changed from high to low water. And our measurements showed our tanks were able to go between the poles on the beach.’ Mr Stone was a modest man and his widow Nora, 87, whom he married in 1946, said he only spoke of his heroics when pressed. She said: ‘I was very proud of him.’ Top honour: Stone was awarded the Military Cross for his bravery as he helped save thousands of lives .

After his All My Rowdy Friends song was yanked from the Monday Night Football opening by ESPN later that day in protest, Williams issued a statement acknowledging that his 'analogy was extreme' but insisting it was intended to illustrate how ludicrous he thought it was for Obama and Boehner to team up at golf. 'They're polar opposites and it made no sense. They don't see eye-to-eye and never will,' the bearded singer said. Outrageous: The singer compared President Obama, left, to Adolf Hitler . Williams, 62, was scheduled to return . to the Fox News Channel with an interview on Tuesday on the Hannity . show, but the network said that the singer decided to cancel. Hours . later, he posted yet another, somewhat more contrite statement, saying: . 'I have always been very passionate about politics and sports, and this . time it got the best or worst of me. 'The . thought of the leaders of both parties jukin and high fiven on a golf . course, while so many families are struggling to get by simply made me . boil over and make a dumb statement, and I am very sorry if it offended . anyone,' he wrote. He concluded, 'I would like to thank all my supporters. This was not written by some publicist.' The . statement was posted just below a link to a video clip from the ABC . daytime talk show The View, in which host Whoopi Goldberg suggested . Williams was judged too harshly. 'Hank . is a musician, and he's always been provocative,' Goldberg said on the . show. 'He could have chosen his words more wisely, but as someone who . steps in it quite often, we all do it. Those among us who are without . sin, cast the first stone.'

Not a single person has left the protest camp outside St Paul's Cathedral since a legal eviction notice was served giving them 24 hours to quit, activists said. The City of London Corporation had told the protesters to move tents and equipment from the public highway by 6pm last night or face High Court action. But instead of packing up, protesters were discussing putting up Christmas decorations as they prepare for a lengthy legal battle. You've been served: A bailiff pins an eviction notice to a tent outside St Paul's Cathedral . Time to leave: Bailiffs acting for the Corporation of London handed out eviction notices to the tents at the City Of London site . Bailiffs had tied notes to some of the 200 tents pitched in the churchyard telling activists to leave or face High Court action. But protesters vowed to continue and a sign on one of the tents yesterday declared: ‘Hell, no – we won’t go!’ The notice was issued a day after U.S. police cleared the Occupy Wall Street camp in New York. But lawyers warn the situation is more complex here due to human rights laws and the eviction could drag on for months. The Corporation had halted earlier court action to hold talks with protesters. But policy chairman Stuart Fraser said the negotiations went ‘nowhere’. Naomi Colvin, for Occupy London, insisted earlier this week the eviction ‘was not something we need to be remotely worried about’. She added: ‘It could take months. We will contest it.’ Legal threat: The warning notice handed out to protesters . The Mail told last month how thermal imaging cameras showed the camp virtually empty at night. Even if the court action succeeds, the protest is likely be continue in the churchyard during the day as long as nobody pitches tents. Adam Chapman, head of public law at Kingsley Napley, said the Human . Rights Act would make evicting London protesters a far more complex . affair. Before deciding . whether to give the go-ahead to the eviction, a judge would have to . consider Article 10, which covers freedom of expression, and Article 11, . freedom of assembly, he said. ‘Any judgment would hinge on whether the interference with those rights is ""proportionate"". Deadline passed: The anti-capitalist protesters did have the option of leaving voluntarily - but not one person has gone home . ‘The . protesters have in their favour that St Paul’s remains open and so . there is not a massive amount of disruption to the normal use of the . land. ‘The Corporation of . London also needs to decide if is just trying to remove the camp, or to . stop the protest altogether, which would be much more difficult. ‘It is likely that we could get a . situation where, even after the removal of the tents, protests are . allowed to continue outside St Paul’s during the day.’ He said there were likely to be . similarities with the attempts to evict the protesters camped in . Parliament Square which began in May 2010 but only concluded ten months . later in March this year. On patrol: Police officers walk among protesters outside St Paul's Cathedral on Wednesday . The anti-capitalist protest at the Cathedral is part of a series in cities across the globe which aim to highlight the inequalities caused by mismanagement of the economy. Demonstrators have been camped outside St Paul’s since October 15 after an attempt to occupy the nearby London Stock Exchange failed. The City of London Corporation halted earlier court action to hold talks with protest organisers aimed at finding a compromise that would allow the demonstrators to remain at the site until January if they removed some of the tents. After a humiliating . internal row within the church which led to two high profile . resignations, St Paul’s Cathedral decided not to join the legal action . against the protesters. A spokeswoman for St Paul’s said earlier this week: ‘We recognise the local authority’s statutory right to proceed with the action. ‘We . have always desired a peaceful resolution and the Canons will continue . to hold regular meetings with representative of the protesters.’","Activists had been told to leave camp by 6pm yesterday or face eviction .

"By . Simon Tomlinson . Last updated at 5:59 PM on 18th November 2011 . Douglas Tompkins is not one to shy away from a challenge. It is a trait that has seen the businessman-turned-environmentalist rise from high school drop-out to multi-millionaire in a career that has been as diverse as it has been successful. Now the 68-year-old founder of outdoor clothing firm North Face and women's fashion chain Esprit looks as though he may close to realising another dream - his long-held and passionate attempts to create a vast nature reserve in Argentina. Green aspirations: North Face and Esprit founder Douglas Tompkins at his property in Ibera, Argentina, in 2009 where he wants to donate 370,000 acres of land to the government to create a new national park . Need for preservation: A group of caymans in Laguna Ibera at the Esteros del Ibera, which is thought to be the second-largest wetland system in the world. It is, however, coming under increasing pressure from agriculture . It is a quest that has provoked fierce criticism from the South American country's inhabitants, most notably that of Land Minster Luis Delia, who, three years ago, described him as a 'gringo imperialist' after Mr Tompkins had bought up huge amounts of land for conservation work. Mr Delia even promised to expropriate his holdings over fears he was a threat to national sovereignty. But since the death of populist president Nestor Kirchner, there has been a warming of relations. This week, Mr Tompkins announced his intention to donate 370,000 acres of his land on the Esteros del Ibera wetlands in the province of Correntes, worth £120million, to the country in a bid to create a new national park. Mixed use: The Esteros del Ibera lies in Argentina's sub-tropical far north. it consists of some protected land, Mr Tompkins's estates and areas largely privately owned for agriculture . Conserving nature: The wetlands are home to more than 4,000 different species, including capybaras (pictured) and anacondas. If the area became a national park, Mr Tompkins's non-profit group would re-introduce several animals previously wiped out there . It is hoped the park would protect . the wetlands, the second-largest in the world, from farming and . agriculture. Mr Tompkins's non-profit group The Conservation Land . Trust (CLT) would also attempt to re-introduce species previously wiped out . from the area. The 3.2million-acre reserve is afforded only limited protection as nearly half the area is divided into farms. The North Face brand was established in San Francisco in 1966 when Douglas Tompkins and Kenneth Klopp created an equipment retail store that went on to acquire the famous name. The name came about because the north face of a mountain in the northern hemisphere is usually the most challenging to climb. It began as a mail order and retail company and in the early years was a leader in the design of sleeping bags and tents. Tompkins and his partner designed the pioneering North Face tents which did away with the need for a pole in the middle by using bendable rods. Tompkins sold The North Face in 1969 for $50,000 to focus on adventure film making and later to launch Esprit. The company logo (pictured) was designed by David Alcorn in 1971 and consists of a quarter-circle with two lines running within it next to the name. Continuing to thrive, the company hopes to double its turnover to $3billion over the next five years. However, . the deal has to break through one last barrier - that of Corrientes . Governor Ricardo Colombi, who fiercely opposes the plan because he . believes it would put the local farmers out of business. It . was hoped Mr Colombi's administration might be persuaded to hand over the 1.36million . acres it holds to the national government. But Mr Tompkins and the current president, . Cristina Kirchner will now wait and see if Mr . Colombi's successor, set to replace him in 2013, is more supportive. 'It . is a political issue, between the national and regional governments. It . is not our responsibility,' CLT spokeswoman Marian Labourt told The . Independent. Mr Tompkins was born in Ohio in . 1943 to an antiques dealer and decorator and raised in Millbrook, New . York, a summer resort for Manhattan's elite. After . dropping out of high school, he moved to California where he attempted . to make it onto the US ski team for the 1964 Winter Olympics. Around the same time, he set up the California Mountaineering Guide Service. He failed to be picked, so he decided to turn his hand to another talent - business and design. Soon . after, he founded The North Face with Kenneth Klopp in San Francisco as a . mail order and retail company specialising in rock climbing and camping . equipment before selling it a few years later for $50,000. In 1968, Mr Tompkins then teamed up with Susie to create a dress-making company, selling clothes out of the back of a VW bus. That company would become Esprit, which by 1978 was enjoying sales in excess of $100million a year. Green team: Mr Tompkins with his second and current wife, Kristine, with whom he has helped to conserve more than two million acres of wilderness in Chile and Argentina . But . by the 1980s, when Esprit was flying even higher, Mr Tompkins had a . change of outlook, which he later explained, saying: 'Fashion is one of the most . intellectually vacuous industries. 'We . had to manufacture desires to get people to buy our products. We were . selling people countless things that they didn't need.' Fashion fix: Mr Tompkins set up Esprit with his first wife in 1968. They started out by selling clothes off the back of a bus . He . sold his share of the American company in 1989 back to Susie, from whom . he had separated, and has since devoted his $150m fortune to buying up . vast swathes of land in Chile and Argentina. Mr Tompkins moved to south Chile, where he devoted much of his time to land conservation and environmental activism. He founded the Foundation for Deep . Ecology in 1990, which supports environmental activism, and The . Conservation Land Trust in 1992, which works to protect wildlands, . primarily in Chile and Argentina. In 1993, he married Kristine Tompkins (nee McDivitt) and the two have worked together on their conservation projects. They have spent about millions buying two dozen properties covering 2.2million acres in the two South American countries. His land donations helped to establish the Pumalin and Corcovado National Parks in Chile, preventing loggers from cutting through the ancient woodland. But he has not been without his critics as many locals began to speculate about this American's motives. Some claims were outlandish, such as him wanting to create a nuclear dumping ground, while others speculated that he wanted to seize control of water supplies. Antonio Horvath, a conservative senator for southern Chile once said: 'If I were to go to the United States and buy a big area of Florida as an environmental preserve and tell people they can't go here or there, I think the U.S. would kick me right out of there.' El Litoral, the regional newspaper in Corrientes, once described Mr Tompkins's projects as 'tentacles' wrapping around Ibera. You will have to what this space to see if Mr Tompkins's latest venture is a manageable ascent or a cliff face that's just too steep to climb.","Douglas Tompkins wants to donate 370,000 acres of land to create national park in Argentina .

"By . Anthony Bond . Last updated at 4:41 PM on 17th November 2011 . FIFA president Sepp Blatter came under intense pressure today as leading figures in the English game joined the calls for him to resign over his racism gaffe. The world of football has united in calling for the controversial head of FIFA to quit after he dismissed on-pitch racism during a TV interview. Today, Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, and UK Sports Minister Hugh Robertson both weighed in to the debate, saying it was time for Blatter to step down. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Taylor said: 'I just feel it's the straw that broke the camel's back. Comments: Sepp Blatter has provoked more controversy by claiming that racism in football can be solved with a handshake . 'When you see the corruption they've had at FIFA, the comments he made about homosexuals not going to Qatar, the way he talked about women's football, the style of the arrangements for the World Cup, the fact he won't have technology. I think it's really time to move over for Michel Platini. 'It is embarrassing – if one person should get it about racism it is the head of FIFA, which has 200 countries in the world, is so diverse with different cultures, creeds and colours.' Sports minister Hugh Robertson said: 'This is incredibly serious but it is part of a pattern of behaviour.' Asked whether Mr Blatter should go, he . told BBC Radio Five Live: 'Yes. I can't see there's anything terribly . new in this. We've been saying this for some time.' Labour leader Ed Miliband also weighed . into the row, branding Mr Blatter's comments a 'disgrace' and saying . that world of football needed new leadership. Time to go: Sports Minister Hugh Robertson, left, and Gordon Taylor, the chief executive of the Professional Footballers' Association, have called for Sepp Blatter to resign . Blatter today became embroiled in a Twitter war-of-words with England player Rio Ferdinand, whose brother Anton is currently involved in a racism claim with the Football Association over comments allegedly made by John Terry. The Manchester United defender contacted Blatter's Twitter account directly, writing: '@SeppBlatter your comments on racism are so condescending its almost laughable. If fans shout racist chants but shake our hands is that ok?'. Ferdinand also criticised FIFA's . attempts to clarify Blatter's comments with a statement on their website . underneath a picture of Blatter with South African minister Tokyo . Sexwale, who was imprisoned on Robben Island during the apartheid era. Row: Manchester United and England star Rio Ferdinand became embroiled in a Twitter row with Sepp Blatter over the FIFA president's comments on racism . Ferdinand wrote: 'Fifa clear up the blatter comments with a pic of him posing with a black man..I need the hand covering eyes symbol!!' Blatter was stung into a response today and replied directly to Ferdinand saying: 'The ""black man"" as you call him has a name: Tokyo Sexwale. He has done tremendous work against racism and apartheid in Africa. 'We have done several joint activities to raise awareness on the struggle against racism in South Africa. FIFA has a long standing and proud record in the area of anti-discrimination which will continue.' But Ferdinand posted more tweets today, accusing Blatter of ignorance. He wrote: 'To say what you said about racism in football spoke volumes of your ignorance to the subject. A second message read: 'I guess you now have the full support of all the women, gay community + people against racism in football....'. A third tweet said: 'If we want 2 stamp out racism in society a football pitch is a good place to start-loved by billions of people around the world'. The controversy started when Blatter was asked directly by a CNN reporter if racism exists on the pitch, Blatter denied it and said such incidents should simply be settled by a handshake at the end of the match. 'I would deny it,' he said. 'There is no racism, there is maybe one of the players towards another, he has a word or a gesture which is not the correct one, but also the one who is affected by that, he should say that this is a game. 'We are in a game, and at the end of the game, we shake hands, and this can happen. 'On the field of play sometimes you say something that is not very correct, but then at the end of the game you have the next game where you can behave better.' Investigation: Chelsea's John Terry has been accused of making a racist comment at QPR's Anton Ferdinand . To a reporter from Al-Jazeera he simply compounded the situation. 'During a match you may say something to somebody who is not exactly looking like you,' he said. 'But at the end... it's forgotten.' It comes as Luis Suarez was charged by the FA over allegations that he racially abused Patrice Evra. At the same time, England captain John Terry remains the subject of an FA inquiry and a formal Metropolitan Police investigation into claims that he racially abused Anton Ferdinand at Loftus Road last month. Now Blatter is facing a fight to hold on to his job after a backlash from the world of football. In a statement, Blatter said: 'I would like to make it very clear, I am committed to the fight against racism and any type of discrimination infootball and in society. 'I have been personally leading this battle against racism in football, which FIFA has been fighting against throughout the past years through campaigns in all of our competitions such as the 'Say no to racism' campaign. 'I also know that racism unfortunately continues to exist in football, and I have never denied this. 'My comments have been misunderstood. What I wanted to express is that, as football players, during a match, you have 'battles' with your opponents, and sometimes things are done which are wrong. But, normally, at the end of the match, you apologise to your opponent if you had a confrontation during the match, you shake hands, and when the game is over, it is over. 'Anyone who has played a football match, or a match in any sport, knows that this is the case.'","Head of Professional Footballers' Association and UK Sports Minister lead calls for Blatter to quit .

"By . Lucy Buckland . Last updated at 3:36 PM on 17th November 2011 . Surreal: Winemaker Duncan Schwab, 45, at his vineyard in Totnes, Devon, was Tasered by blundering police officers . A winemaker on his way home from harvesting grapes was Tasered by blundering police in a bizarre mix up over a burning car. Duncan Schwab had driven past a burning car when police suddenly smashed his van window with a baton and fired the electrical stun device at his shoulder. The shocked 45-year-old vintner was still reeling from the blow when he was taken to a police station in Totnes, Devon. He was breath tested but charged with failing to stop when asked and the matter ended up in court a year on. But at the start of the trial no evidence was offered and the court case was dropped. Mr . Schwab, from the well known Sharpham vineyard in Totnes, maintained all . along he had done nothing wrong and did not see officers signalling for . him to stop as he passed a burning car. After the case was dismissed, he said the incident was 'one of the most surreal moments in my life'. He said: 'From my point of view it all . happened over a year ago but has been hanging over me since. I just . want to get on with my work.' The incident began in the early hours of one October morning last year when he was driving with two passengers down a local road where they encountered a burning car. Explanations: Police said they were 'in a heightened state of alert' when they Tasered Duncan Schwab . He had been harvesting the Sharpham grapes and was on his way home. 'I reversed back and there was an officer hiding in a hedge who came out, smashed the side window and fired the Taser.' He claimed the officers then asked him what it felt like to be Tasered, replying that it was like erecting an electric badger fence. He said: 'They thought I was connected to the burned out car. They did not signal.' Prosecutor Sue Roberts told magistrates at Newton Abbot, Devon, before the trial: 'The prosecution decision is to offer no evidence and we would like the case to be dismissed.' In hiding: Police were behind a hedge in Totnes (pictured) when Duncan Schwab drove past . Devon and Cornwall police said officers had been investigating an incident when a car hit a house and burst into flames. They had been on the look out for culprits and were 'in a heightened state of alert'. The dispute was about whether Mr Schwab had failed to stop when signalled to do so. His solicitor Nigel Butt made a request for defence costs to be paid.","Police said Duncan Schwab failed to stop when asked as he drove past burning car .
