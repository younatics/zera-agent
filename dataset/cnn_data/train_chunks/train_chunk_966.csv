"QPR defender Rio Ferdinand wants English football authorities to consider introducing their own version of the NFL's Rooney Rule, which is designed to promote the hiring of black and ethnic minority coaches. Last week Professional Footballers' Association chief executive Gordon Taylor said 'there is a hidden racism which holds clubs back' when it comes to hiring managers. And Taylor wants to see the English game adopt the Rooney Rule, which is used in the NFL to ensure such candidates are adequately represented in the interview process for head coaching positions. Rio Ferdinand has endured a tough start to his QPR career after joining from Manchester United this summer . The defender is open to a rule that promotes the hiring of more black and ethnic minority coaches in England . The NFL employs the Rooney Rule to address the issue of a lack of coaches from minority backgrounds . When asked if he thought the rule should be introduced in England, Ferdinand told the BBC: 'It is something to be discussed definitely. 'It's been used in NFL, can it be replicated here? 'In football it's a mates game, rather than your colour. It's about whether they have a relationship with you and know that they can trust you.' Ferdinand was at the Mayfair Hotel in London last week to launch his new book #2sides . Only two out of 92 clubs in English football's top four divisions employ a black manager after Chris Powell took charge of Huddersfield and Keith Curle joined Carlisle last month. And asked about the state of racism in British football, Ferdinand said: 'It's hard to say. 'Football is a great tool to use but I think society is the bigger problem. 'It's about educating people. It's a long and winding path.' Huddersfield boss Chris Powell is one of just two black managers in the top  four divisions of English football .","QPR defender Rio Ferdinand wants an equivalent in English football of the NFL's Rooney Rule .

"Italian Football Federation president Carlo Tavecchio has been handed a six-month ban by UEFA over alleged racist comments made by him during his election campaign. The 71-year-old drew heavy criticism in July by making an allegedly racist comment about 'eating bananas' during an address to a summer assembly of Italy's amateur leagues. Both UEFA and FIFA launched investigations into the matter and the European governing body has now confirmed that Tavecchio will be 'ineligible for any position as a UEFA Official for a period of six months'. Carlo Tavecchio has been handed a six-month ban by UEFA for making alleged racist remarks . The campaign against Tavecchio's candidacy began when he made an allegedly racist comment when using a fictional example to try to make a point about the number of foreign players in the Italian leagues. Quoted by newspaper La Repubblica, Tavecchio said: 'England identifies the players coming in and, if they are professional, they are allowed to play. 'Here, on the other hand, let's say there's (fictional player) Opti Poba, who has come here, who previously was eating bananas and now is a first-team player for Lazio. 'In England he has to demonstrate his CV and his pedigree.' The Italian Football Federation president allegedly did so during an address to Italy's amateur leagues . Despite the controversy, he beat former AC Milan player Demetrio Albertini in the race to succeed Giancarlo Abete. He subsequently apologised and the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) decided not to take any action but UEFA's Ethics and Disciplinary Body (CEDB) conducted its own investigations. Upon learning of UEFA's investigation, Tavecchio said in a statement: 'I am calm and I respect UEFA's decision. 'It's something that had to be done, hence, we had foreseen it. I am certain that I will also be able to explain in UEFA's headquarters my mistake as well as my true intentions.' Tavecchio has since apologised for his comments following a FIFA and UEFA investigation . And the CEDB has now made its judgement with Tavecchio banned for six months, prevented from attending the UEFA Congress in March and being obliged to organise a racism awareness event. 'Following a request for information made by UEFA to the FIGC, on 20 August 2014 the UEFA Chief Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector opened a disciplinary investigation regarding alleged racist comments made by Mr. Tavecchio during his FIGC presidential election campaign,' read a statement from UEFA. 'At the request of the UEFA Chief Ethics and Disciplinary Inspector disciplinary proceedings were opened against Mr. Tavecchio on 29 September 2014. Despite the race controversy, Tavecchio beat Demetrio Albertini to presidency this summer . 'After having analyzed the case file and the statements submitted by both parties, the CEDB has decided, based on Articles 6, 7, 14(1) and 34(5) DR [in the spirit of UEFA's Resolution entitled European Football united against racism] and taking into account Mr. Tavecchio's decision to immediately refrain from participating in any UEFA's activity pending the resolution of the matter, as follows: . 'Mr. Tavecchio will be ineligible for any position as a UEFA Official for a period of six months starting from the communication of this decision; . 'Mr. Tavecchio will not participate in the next UEFA Congress scheduled for 24 March 2015; . 'Mr. Tavecchio will organise a special event in Italy aimed at increasing awareness and compliance with the principles of UEFA's Resolution entitled European Football united against racism.'","Italian Football Federation president Carlo Tavecchio has been banned for six months by UEFA after making an alleged racist comment .

"Unattractive people are more memorable than pretty ones, unless a beautiful person has distinctive facial features, like Angelina Jolie (pictured) The old maxim of never forgetting a pretty face might be untrue as psychologists believe beautiful people are less likely to be recognised. A new study suggests that attractiveness can actually prevent the recognition of faces, unless a pretty face is particularly distinctive. German psychologists think the recognition of pretty faces is distorted by emotions. Scientists at the University of Jena, Germany, discovered that photos of unattractive people were more memorable than pretty ones when they showed them to a group of people. However, people were able to easily remember a beautiful face with distinctive features, such as Angelina Jolie’s. Researchers Holger Wiese, Carolin Altmann and Stefan Schweinberger from the university, wrote in their study: ‘We could show that the test subjects were more likely to remember unattractive faces than attractive ones, when the latter didn't have any particularly noticeable traits.’ For the study, which was published in science magazine Neuropsychologia, the psychologists showed photos of faces to test subjects. Half of the faces were considered to be more attractive and the other half as less attractive - but all of them were being thought of as similarly distinctive looking. The scientists assume emotional influences distort the recognition of pretty faces. They used EEG-recordings which show the brain's electric activity during the memory tests. A stock image of a man with electrodes on his head is pictured . A recent study found beautiful people do better in their careers – even after their youthful good looks have begun to fade. At each career stage studied, pretty people held more prestigious jobs than plain Janes. Researcher Gundi Knies, of Essex University’s Institute for Social and Economic Research, said good looking people may benefit from a ‘beauty premium’. She added: ‘We found facial attractiveness is important in determining people’s occupational prestige at the beginning of the career as it is in the middle or at the end.’ The study tracked the career outcomes of more than 8,000 people and found the best looking were more successful throughout their whole lives. 'Or, in other words, the so called beauty premium is stable throughout people's employment history and pretty people are doing better even as they age.' The test subjects were shown the faces . for just a few seconds to memorise them and were shown them again . during the test so that they could decide if they recognised them or . not. The scientists were surprised by the result. ‘Until . now we assumed that it was generally easier to memorise faces, which . are being perceived as attractive - just because we prefer looking at . beautiful faces,’ Dr Wiese said. But the study showed that such a correlation cannot be easily sustained. He assumes that remembering pretty faces is distorted by emotional influences, which enhance the sense of recognition at a later time. The researchers’ idea is backed up by evidence from EEG-recordings which show the brain’s electric activity, which the scientists used during their experiment. The study also revealed that in the case of attractive faces, considerably more false positive results were detected. In other words, people thought they recognised a face without having seen it before. ‘We obviously tend to believe that we recognise a face just because we find it attractive,’ Dr Wiese said.","A study by the University of Jena in Germany found photos of unattractive people were more recognisable than pretty ones .

"From his lavish contemporary mansion to the Aston Martin sports car parked outside it, Lottery winner John Noakes is surrounded by the trappings that come with having millions in the bank. As part of a syndicate of 12 struggling bus drivers who shared a £38million jackpot, Mr Noakes, from Corby, thought all his dreams had come true when their numbers came up a year ago. But the multi-millionaire, who still lives in the Northamptonshire town with his second wife Jean, has told how the windfall brought with it hardship as well as happiness, adding: 'Sometimes I wish I'd never won.' 'Tough': Former bus driver John Noakes, seen with his wife Jean, said there have been some downsides to scooping a share of a £38million Lottery fortune . The former Bus Driver of the Year, 50, told the Sunday People how the members of the syndicate - who each scooped over £3million - had been beset by problems since their win; from family feuds to health scares. Mr Noakes told how various troubles forced four of the former colleagues to move out of the Northamptonshire town - with two leaving Britain altogether. He and Jean are now preparing to leave Corby for a new life in Cyprus. 'Becoming multi-millionaires changed our lives – but not all for the good,' said Mr Noakes, who said he recently started smoking again due to stress. While he is 'glad' he won the money, 'the transition from being broke to rich has been tough', he said. 'Tough': John Noakes said he and his wife Jean have not forgotten their former frugal ways . Pros and cons: Mr Noakes, who has a racing car simulator, left, and a pet parrot, right, at his Corby home, said many of his old friends 'don't want to know' since his Euromillions windfall . The former Stagecoach driver said he has had to learn to keep track of his money to ensure it lasts, and that many of his old friends now 'don't want to know'. He said he is approached by strangers in the street who ask him for money, and claims his former employers snubbed his offer to help out free of charge during last year's Olympic Games. Mr Noakes added that it was 'tough' trying to be 'equally fair' to members of his family without upsetting anybody. He and his wife are now planning to start a new life in Cyprus. Lavish: The couple have bought six houses with the proceeds of their lottery win, including their contemporary Corby mansion . Luxury: The snooker table at the couple's Corby home is overlooked by prints of Marilyn Monroe and Audrey Hepburn . The 50-year-old, who quit his £18,000 a year driving job after scooping £3,169,553, insists he hasn't changed a bit since the win, and claims he and wife Jean still shop at Poundland. His Aston Martin is second-hand, while Mrs Noakes said she still looks for bargains when clothes shopping. Life-changing: Mr Noakes is seen on the left with other members of the syndicate celebrating their huge Euromillions win in March last year . Nonetheless, Mr Noakes' life today is almost unrecognisable from his days of driving buses. The couple have bought six houses, including their own contemporary mansion complete with tennis court, and four for their children from previous marriages. Another member of the syndicate, Alex Robertson, 58, is moving to Spain to escape family feuds after the lottery win, according to the report.","John Noakes won more than £3million as part of a syndicate a year ago .

"When it comes to choosing what stories we like to click on when browsing news websites it seems we really are drawn in by tales of crime and scandal. According to new research from the University of Bristol, people who read online news websites love to find out about the latest exploits of their favourite celebrities or read up on the latest fashions. Yet they are not so enthusiastic when it comes to reading about politics or the economy. Celebrity matters: Online news readers are more interested in finding out about famous people like the Duchess of Cambridge, left, and Kim Kardashian, right, than matters of politics or the economy . When the researchers from the University of Bristol looked at the most clicked news stories on the Australian site News.com.au they discovered that those containing the words 'woman', 'sex', 'girl', 'porn' and 'mum' were most popular. While stories containing the words 'nsw', 'australian', 'flood' and 'queensland' were least likely to be clicked on . You can now see what weird and wonderful videos are being watched right now by people across the United States using YouTube's trend map. The map shows the most popular clips and can even filter by cities, age ranges and gender. It can also tell you whether a video is being shared a lot, or viewed a lot. Go to youtube.com/trendsmap to explore the trending videos. The study by researchers from Bristol University's Intelligent Systems Laboratory looked at which stories . were placed in the 'top stories' and 'most popular' feeds on a variety . of news websites including the BBC and New York Times to find out what . makes readers want to click on a story. The research, led by Nello Cristianini, Professor of Artificial Intelligence, identified the most attractive keywords, as well as the least attractive ones, and explained the choices readers made. When the researchers from the University of Bristol looked at the most clicked news stories on the Australian site News.com.au, for example, they discovered that those containing the words 'woman', 'sex', 'girl', 'porn' and 'mum' were most popular. While stories containing the words 'nsw', 'australian', 'flood' and 'queensland' were least likely to be clicked on. For Forbes readers, stories containing 'richest', 'app', 'best' and 'worst' were more likely to be clicked on. Whereas stories containing the words 'share', 'stock' and 'dividend' were less popular. The researchers found that using 'sentimentally charged language' and skewing towards entertainment and crime seemed to attract the most clicks. The most popular words from the Forbes news website are shown in pink, with the least popular in black. Forbes readers clicked on more stories containing the words 'app', 'richest', 'worst' and 'best'.

"Convicted murderer Jodi Arias appeared in court today in her striped and crumpled prison jumpsuit as she waits to find out whether she will face the death penalty. During a hearing on Tuesday in Phoenix, Judge Sherry Stephens gave attorneys additional time to file motions as Arias' lawyers want the jury's finding that made her eligible for the death penalty vacated. Arias, 32, looked tired and worn with her hair knotted in a bun, compared to the dramatic performances she had often put on during her months-long trial. A new hearing was set for August 26. Arias was convicted of murder on May 8 in the death of boyfriend Travis Alexander. He had been stabbed 27 times, his throat slit open and was shot in the head at his Arizona home in June 2008. Back in court: Jodi Arias appears for a hearing on July 16 over whether a new jury will be picked to decide if she should face the death penalty in Arizona . Advice: Jodi Arias talks with her defense attorney, Jennifer Wilmott, left, during a hearing on Tuesday . All eyes on me: Arias will next appear in court on August 26 for another hearing about the death-penalty phase of her trial . The jury failed to reach a unanimous decision in May on whether to sentence Arias to life in prison or death. While . her murder conviction stands, prosecutors must now decide whether to . try again for a death sentence with a new jury or to settle for life in . prison. Arias, a former waitress from California, admitted she killed Alexander, but claimed self-defense. In May, the eight-man, four-woman jury that convicted Arias of murder and quickly ruled her eligible for the death penalty subsequently failed to reach a consensus as to whether she should be executed, prompting a penalty-phase mistrial. In court filings, prosecutors have asked the judge to begin new penalty-phase proceedings on July 30. But defense attorneys asked that the proceedings be delayed until January because of scheduling conflicts and the possibility that Arias might want to call witnesses to speak on her behalf. State prosecutors have the option of retrying the sentencing phase before a new jury, or could allow her to be sentenced to a mandatory life-term by the judge. Back in court: Jodi Arias points to her family as a reason for the jury to give her a life in prison sentence instead of the death penalty during her trial in May. Arguments begin today over whether she will face a new jury to decide her fate . Murdered in his home: Arias was found guilty of stabbing and shooting Alexander at his Arizona home in June 2008 . If there is another jury deadlock at retrial, a judge would sentence Arias to spend the rest of her life in prison, or to life with the possibility of parole after 25 years. County Attorney Bill Montgomery has consistently maintained since the first jury deadlocked that he would ask the new jurors to put Arias to death. After the jury failed to reach a unanimous decision on May 23, Montgomery said that his office would assess its next steps, but was proceeding 'with the intent to retry the penalty phase'. The trial began in January and become a staple for U.S. cable television viewers with its tale of a soft-spoken, young woman charged with such a brutal crime. The trial was punctuated with graphic testimony and bloody photographs. Arias, 33, took the stand for a marathon 18 days and maintained throughout that the killing was in self-defense despite fierce cross-examination by prosecutors.

"Extravagant: India Rose James at The Look Of Love premiere, the film about her grandfather Paul Raymond . She is the porn baron’s grand-daughter whose family wealth exceeds £300million. But although she is one of the luckiest 21-year-olds in the country, India Rose James is, it seems, keen to squander her fortune. The heiress, who was the youngest person to make yesterday’s Sunday Times Rich List, lives an indulgent and extravagant party lifestyle after benefiting from Paul Raymond’s will. Her £329million fortune, which she shares with her sister Fawn, makes them technically richer than the Queen. The rich list also revealed that: . Miss James is not afraid to showcase her wealth, whether it is nights out arm in arm with Playboy bunnies, watching a £10 note go up in flames or jet-setting around the world. The self-styled part-time princess of Soho litters her Twitter page with pictures of her partying with tattooed model boyfriend Jake Hold and boasts about the time she has enjoyed in Los Angeles, Dubai, Paris and Rome. She talks about spending £180 on sweets and one photograph shows a £10 note being burned with the comment ‘just saw £10 go up in flames... I could have used that to go home’. Another tweet states: ‘On Alex’s roof in Soho, looking down on the little people.’ And . when your sister is a multi-millionaire too it means you have to . compete with her to impress daddy when it’s his 60th birthday. Last . month, India tweeted: ‘So I have 7 days to get my dad a better present . then (sic) what my sister got him – she got him a Bentley.’ Porn Baron: India Rose's grandfather Paul Raymond at his revue bar in Soho with some exotic dancers . Money to burn: A picture of a ten pound note on fire, posted by India Rose James on her Twitter account . Raymond built up his fortune launching the country’s first topless dancing club and introducing top-shelf magazines to the UK. Along the way he acquired the freeholds on almost two-thirds of Soho’s properties, building up a seedy business empire estimated to be worth around £650million. Top spot: Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, 59, and his wife . According to the Sunday Times Rich List 2013, when their grandfather died in 2008, Miss James and her sister Fawn, 27, inherited 80 per cent of his money and businesses. Now they share a £329million fortune, up £12million on last year, and are the biggest landlords in London’s entertainment centre. They are ranked at 265 in the list, making them richer than the Queen, who is in 268th position with £320million, up £10million on last year. They own 60 acres of prime real estate. Their father John is managing director of Soho Estates. The sisters are the children of Debbie Raymond, whose death in 1992 from a drug and drink binge drove her father Paul to become a haunted recluse. Debbie, 36, had already taken over parts of the empire and was expected to carry on his legacy. It is thought that Paul Raymond’s son Howard, 53, had to settle for 20 per cent of his father’s fortune after they fell out when he started taking cocaine in his 20s. Fawn is a director of Soho Estates and recently pledged to kick strippers out of a club above her grandfather’s Revuebar. She also runs some charitable activities. In contrast, India is fashion editor for obscure magazine Fault and an aspiring actress. But in February, she appeared to be growing tired of this, moaning: ‘I’m going to apply to a school, I’m bored in life.’ The Look of Love, a film documenting Paul Raymond’s life which stars Steve Coogan, is being released in UK cinemas on Friday. Alisher Usmanov, a part-owner of Arsenal football club, is the most affluent person in the country with a £13.3billion fortune. The second richest is another Russian oligarch, Len Blavatnik, who is worth £11billion. Former Miss UK Kirsty Bertarelli, whose family fortune stands at £7.4billion, is the wealthiest woman in the rich list. The Duke of Westminster’s property interests make him worth £7.8billion, placing him eighth in the list. Adele has been named the richest young musician in the country for a second year following the success of her song for the James Bond film Skyfall. The singer is worth £30million – up £10million on last year.","India Rose James shares her £329million fortune with her sister Fawn .

'His words perfectly illustrate his and the (ruling) AK party's attitude towards women,' she told The Guardian. 'In their eyes, women should not have any rights, they treat us like a separate species.' Turkish men also showed their support. One user wrote that the men of a country 'where women are not allowed to laugh are cowards'.

He said: 'Where are our girls, who slightly blush, lower their heads and turn their eyes away when we look at their face, becoming the symbol of chastity?' Arınç also said he was frustrated by high consumption, referring to the number of cars and mobile phones that individuals now own.

"Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson admits the Champions League will be a learning curve for most of the players this season but he is confident they will adapt quickly. The Reds laboured to a 2-1 win over Bulgarian minnows Ludogorets as they ended a five-year absence from Europe's elite competition at Anfield. Only captain Steven Gerrard survived from the team which played in Liverpool's last match back in December 2009 with nine players making their European debuts for the club and five playing in the Champions League for the first time. Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson runs towards goal in their game against Ludogorets on Tuesday . Henderson heads an effort on target during the Champions League clash against Ludogorets at Anfield . Henderson, one of those making his competition debut, accepts there is some adjustment to be made but he feels they will soon click into gear. 'We thought it would be difficult as there are no easy games in the Champions League,' said Liverpool's newly-installed vice-captain. 'It wasn't easy at all and they made it difficult. We will learn a lot from it but the most important thing was three points. 'It (Champions League) is a little bit different. I thought the crowd were incredible and the atmosphere was brilliant but you just have to adapt as best you can. 'You just have to play your own game and we did that at times but we can still be better. Everybody is looking forward to the next game now and we've got to keep improving.' Striker Mario Balotelli scored his first goal since a £16million summer move from AC Milan and Henderson believes it will kick-start the Italy international's career. 'It will be really important for him and the club as well because he is off the mark now and I think that will give him the confidence to go and get a lot more,' he added. 'He worked his socks off and he got his just rewards. 'It is always important to get off the mark so it is nice it has come for him in the Champions League and hopefully he can get another one at the weekend against West Ham.' Steven Gerrard saved Liverpool blushes as he scored an injury-time penalty to ensure a Liverpool win . Manager Brendan Rodgers' decision this week to make Henderson Gerrard's deputy when it comes to wearing the armband shows how far the 24-year-old has progressed in the last two years. The England midfielder is looking to learn from his captain and is relishing the additional burden. 'It means everything really. It's a great honour to be given the extra responsibility by the gaffer,' he said. 'He said not to change anything, to keep doing what I've been doing. 'He feels that I've been doing well and leading the group well at times. 'Hopefully I can continue to do that and it will not change me in any way. 'All I can do is look to support Stevie wherever I can, because he has not only been one of the best leaders for Liverpool and England but in the game itself. 'Like I always have, I'll look to learn from him as best I can. There's no better man than him to do that.'","The Liverpool midfielder says this year's Champions League campaign will be a new experience for many of the squad .

"A trainee nun was kidnapped and gang raped for a week by three men in a suspected revenge attack, Indian media have reported. The 22-year-old was allegedly lured to a train station by her cousins and then held captive and raped over days because they blame her family for their father's murder. It is the latest in a series of appalling rape cases in India this year since a student was gang raped and died from her horrific injuries on a Delhi bus in December. The trainee nun was lured to meet her cousins and held captive and raped for a week (file picture) The suspects dropped her at Brahampur station and warned her not to report the attack to anyone . The nun told police she was due to meet her cousins at a train station near Chennai, in Tamil Nadu, southern India, after they claimed their mother was ill. However, she says she was then taken to a nearby village where she repeatedly attacked. The suspects later dropped her back at the station and told her not to report the incident. The woman's cousins Jotindra Sobhasundar, 30, and Tukuna Sobhasundar, 28, were arrested on Sunday, according to The Times of India. A third suspect was detained on Monday during a series of raids in Kandhamal district. Local media said the nun's brother was questioned in connection with the murder of one the suspects. The attack allegedly happened between July 5 and 11 but has only been made public this week. Sexual violence against women in India has triggered nationwide protests and law changes . It has been condemned by the president of the Catholic Bishops' Conference of India. Cardinal Oswald Gracias, was quoted by Catholic Culture, as saying: 'This gang rape is physical and emotional terrorism. 'Rape is an abhorrent crime and an abominable transgression against the honour of women and reflects the abysmal state of woman in our society, community and nation.' He also accused government agencies of 'appalling apathy'. The death of the Delhi student in December sparked mass protests against the government's initial response to the attack and demonstrators called for better protection for women. This week four Indian girls, aged 12 to 14, were abducted from a care home and gang raped by up to 20 armed men. The children were kidnapped from a hostel at Lawada village in Pakur district.","Trainee nun, 22, said she visited cousins after they said their mother was ill .

"The Taliban has offered to release a U.S.soldier held captive for four years in exchange for five senior operatives who are being held in Guantanamo Bay. Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, from Hailey, Idaho, is the only known American prisoner of war in Afghanistan. He was captured after leaving his base on June 30, 2009, and it is thought he is being held in Pakistan. The offer of a prisoner exchange was made by the Taliban from its political office, which opened in Doha, the capital of the tiny Arab country Qatar, this week. Scroll down for video . Captive: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has been kept as a prisoner of war by the Taliban after being captured . Taliban spokesman Shaheen Suhail said Sergeant Bergdahl 'is, as far as I know, in good condition' but did not comment on where the 27-year-old soldier is being held. Among the five prisoners the Taliban has consistently asked for are Khairullah Khairkhwa, a former governor of Herat, and Mullah Mohammed Fazl, a Taliban military commander. The men have been held at Guantanamo for about a decade. Their release is the top item on the Taliban's agenda, and is seen as more of a priority than peace talks, Mr Suhail, who worked at the Afghan Embassy in Pakistan before the Taliban were ousted from power in 2001, said. 'U.S. officials have made it clear that getting Bowe Bergdahl back from the Taliban is still one of their top priorities,' NBC's Chief Pentagon Correspondent Jim Miklaszewski said. 'It's not unusual when you get into peace negotiations like this that a good faith gesture at the very beginning is some kind of prisoner swap,' he told KTVB. Sergeant Bergdahl's parents received a letter from their son this month, giving them hope that he is still alive. Dream: Bowe Bergdahl joined the military in the hope of exploring the world and helping other people . Campaign: Bowe Bergdahl's family and friends hold a vigil for America's only prisoner of war . Because he is considered to still be in a volatile situation, no details were released from the letter, which was delivered by the International Committee of the Red Cross. The former ballet student was seen as an unlikely recruit for the Army by some, but family and friends say he admired the military for its discipline and for what he saw as its role in protecting the American way of life, according to the New York Times. He was lured into a military life by the promise of travel and the chance to help people across the world. But two months after arriving in Afghanistan he was captured. Since his capture, Sergeant Bergdahl has been forced to appear in several propaganda videos for the Taliban, pleading for an end to the U.S's involvement in the war. It is also believed that he made a daring escape attempt in 2011. He jumped from a first-floor window of a mud-brick house in Pakistan where he was being held, and escaped into underbrush and forested mountains. His captors found him three days later hiding in a trench, covered with leaves and nearly naked, according to a report. Sources described Sgt Bergdahl, as fighting 'like a boxer' when he was found. Negotiations: Secretary of State John Kerry may meet the Taliban to discuss the swap when he arrives in Qatar . Headquarters: The Taliban has opened an office in Qatar, which has infuriated Afghan President Hamid Karzai . The offer of a prisoner swap comes as Secretary of State John Kerry prepares to travel to Doha for a conference on Syria at the weekend. He is expected to meet the Taliban, but state department spokesman Jen Psaki said the U.S. had 'never confirmed' any specific schedule with the Taliban in Doha. Prospective peace talks are also still in question, especially after Afghan President Hamid Karzai became infuriated by the Taliban's move to cast their new office in Doha as a rival embassy, according to ABC. President Karzai has also suspended . negotiations with the U.S. on a bilateral security agreement  to cover American troops staying in Afghanistan after Nato withdraws at the end of next year. At an opening ceremony for the office, a Taliban spokesman said the organization wanted talks with Washington but said its fighters would continue to attack. Prisoner: Since his capture in 2009 Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has been forced to appear in propaganda films . Hours after the ceremony, the group claimed responsibility for a rocket attack on Bagram Air Base near Kabul, that killed four American service members. A prisoner exchange with the Taliban was first discussed in secret talks nearly two years ago. A proposal to send the Guantanamo inmates to Qatar was scuppered when President Karzai demanded that the prisoners were sent to Afghanistan instead. If Mr Kerry does meet the Taliban over the weekend it will be the first  talks between the U.S. and the Taliban in a year and a half. Sergeant Bergdahl's family are holding a rally in Hailey on Saturday to support the campaign to bring him home.","Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl has been held captive since 2009 .

"Senator for Tasmania Jacqui Lambie  has opened up about her life before she became a politician, saying she fought off drug and alcohol abuse and an attempt to kill herself. The straightshooter, as described by PUP boss Clive Palmer, was born and bred in Davenport, Tasmania where there was little employment and growth. 'I wasn't born with a silver spoon in our mouths, and we've had to live that diversity and it hasn't been fun and it hasn't been handed to us on a silver platter,' she told Australian story. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . PUP senator Jacqui Lambie (pictured) told Australian Story how she abused drugs and alcohol and tried to kill herself before reaching parliament . PUP senator Jacqui Lambie (left) and her two sons, Dylan and Brentyn live together. When she was at her rock bottom son Dylan (far right) had to be a carer for his mum before he too started taking drugs at 13 . The daughter of a truck-driver father and factory shift-worker mother, Lambie spent her teenage years in public housing and did not complete high school, instead enlisting in the armed forces. She became a driver before moving into the military police, and while she enjoyed most of her experience serving her country, it was soured by officers who wanted her gone. '90% of those military police men are great but the other 10%, some of those men in there are nothing less than a pack of a***holes,' she said . 'They don't want females in there and they're guna do everything that they possibly can to break them and they weren't breaking me, they were just not going to break me.' Jacqui Lambie (pictured left) was in the armed forces for almost 10 years. She was discharged after suffered a painful back injury but that began her spiral downwards when her compensation payments were cut off . '90% of those military police men are great but the other 10%, some of those men in there are nothing less than a pack of arseholes,' said Jacqui Lambie (pictured as a youngster) She told Australian Story how hard it was for females in the military police and how they tried to break her . Ms Lambie (right) with her son Dylan (left) at home. At seven he was forced to be a carer for his mum after she was discharged from the armed forces with a back injury and turned to drugs and alcohol. But he too, at the age of 13, turned to drugs . Almost ten years in the job was when Ms Lambie suffered a dibilitating injury. In 1997, on a training exercise, she hurt her back after being forced to carry a significant amount of weight. Within two months she was medically discharged. The now senator lodged compensation claims with the department of veteran affairs and after some time she received payments. 'I think I was on the books for about four months and they decided I was maligned and they had video surveillance done on me,' she told Australian Story. That surveillance was used to discredit Ms Lambie and her entitlements were terminated and she was forced to go on a disability pension. That was when her life started spiraling out of control, using alcohol and drugs to null the pain. From abusing drugs and alcohol to becoming a senator. Jacqui Lambie (pictured left) with PUP boss Clive Palmer (pictured right) The moment she realised she wanted to be a politician : Jacqui Lambie in parliament. After the Davenport girl was hit by a car and got the psychological help she needed its then she knew she wanted to make a difference . 'I got worse and then the psychological side of it started to set in, depression basically and then eventually over five or six years that it went into alcohol abuse, pharmaceutical abuse.' she said. At seven, her youngest son Dylan, was forced to become his mum's carer. 'She just shut off really, just closed off from the world, obviously she had no money, she wasn't working, she was sore all the time, she didn't want to go anywhere, just moped around home,' Dylan said. But by the time he was 13 he too, was taking drugs and Jacqui Lambie's world started to fall apart even more and that also increased her bitterness towards the armed forces, who had left her high and dry after serving her country. 'They say thanks for doing service to your country, good one..... so and then we go and fight a bureaucratic system and we watch our families fall apart and we watch our lives in front of us fall apart because rather than help us they'd like to make our lives miserable,' she said. While in 2006 some assistance for her injury returned, it wasn't enough and in 2009 her life changed forever, but not before she hit rock bottom. She continued to abuse drugs and alcohol, she put on weight and the pain from her injury took its toll. Just before becoming a politician Jacqui Lambie (pictured) speaks to the people of Tasmania . Described as a straightshooter by PUP boss Clive Palmer, Jacqui Lambie (pictured) is making waves in the world of politics . 'I'd written a letter to both the boys and left them in my draw and said right here's a perfect opportunity, I had a few drinks and off I went.' 'I'd walked out in front of a car, I'd had enough, I'd had a gutful, that was it, I was finished, I was gone.' Ms Lambie sustained the loss of her two front teeth, a substantial scar to her forehead and a large hematoma to her thigh after she was hit by a car. But it was after she was hospitalised for a long period of time, she got the psychological help she needed before things in her life started to turn around. That was then, the beginning of her rise to becoming a politician, and her chance to make a difference and help those that needed a voice. 'If I'm going to get back at these people, and about to help others, then I could do this through politics,' she said.","PUP senator Jacqui Lambie abused drugs and alcohol before being elected as a senator .

"Simon Mignolet once again cost his side a goal as Liverpool laboured to a win over Ludogorets Razgrad on their Champions League return on Tuesday night. So is it time to trade in the Belgian for a better keeper? We asked Henry Jackson of authoritative Liverpool fansite This Is Anfield to assess whether Mignolet is worthy of the No 1 shirt. When Simon Mignolet joined Liverpool for £9m from Sunderland in the summer of 2013, he was seen as an excellent long-term signing by the club. It's not quite working out like that at the moment, however. The Belgium international is yet to convince during his short time at Anfield, and there is a definite argument that he is a major weak-link in Brendan Rodgers' exciting side. Dani Abalo gets the better of Liverpool goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to equalise for Ludogorets Razgrad . Abalo celebrates his goal but Liverpool did ultimately prevail 2-1 in the Champions League encounter . Mignolet looks on helplessly as Gabriel Agbonlahor (not in shot) scores Aston Villa's winner on Saturday . Mignolet in training at Melwood ahead of Liverpool's Champions League return . Tuesday night's last-gasp Champions League victory over Ludogorets saw Mignolet largely at fault for the visitor's late equaliser, which looked to have cost the hosts two points. The 26-year-old charged out of his goal with Dani Abalo clean-through in stoppage time, making it far too easy for the substitute to round him and slot the ball into an empty net. To put it bluntly, it was very poor goalkeeping. While there can be no doubting Mignolet's shot-stopping ability - Liverpool legend Jamie Carragher is one who passionately argues that all top level goalkeepers should be very good at stopping shots, as it's their job - there is a nervousness about him with the ball at his feet, he lacks dominance aerially and he has the knack of costing his side at big moments. If you look at last season, mistakes by Mignolet ultimately cost Liverpool dearly in their quest for a maiden Premier League title. Brendan Rodgers should be worried about Mignolet's gaffes as Liverpool try to mount a title bid . Mignolet looked like a sound signing when he joined for £9m from Sunderland in the summer of 2013 . Mignolet makes a feeble effort to keep out Alvaro Negredo's shot as Liverpool lost to Man City last season . His woeful attempt to keep out Alvaro Negredo's shot in the 2-1 loss to eventual champions Manchester City at the Etihad on Boxing Day was critical, while a few days later he softly let Samuel Eto'o's tame effort past him as they succumbed to defeat at Chelsea. Although it's both impossible and harsh to blame the Belgian for Rodgers' side not winning the title - they could quite easily not have won the 11 straight games that got them right into the mix - he certainly didn't help matters. Although Liverpool's defence is deservedly taking plenty of criticism at the moment, in particular the likes of Dejan Lovren and Mamadou Sakho at centre-back, a large part of that is because they look like they lack faith in Mignolet. There doesn't appear to be much communication there, and it is proving an issue. Mignolet takes on Stoke striker Peter Crouch in the air during a match last season . Liverpool have been linked with former Barcelona goalkeeper Victor Valdes . Consistent trophy-winning sides almost always have a top-class goalkeeper in their ranks, and at the moment Mignolet does not fall into that category. There are many better than him in the Premier League. The club have been strongly linked with a move for former Barcelona star Victor Valdes over the last few weeks, with the Spain international currently a free agent. The 32-year-old would be the perfect acquisition, and is both a world-class keeper and a born winner. His quality on the ball - something Rodgers is keen for in his goalkeepers - experience and consistency would make a huge difference. Mignolet is far from a bad goalkeeper, but he is not at the level required if Liverpool want to win silverware on a consistent basis. He will cost the Reds crucial points between now and the end of the season if he remains first-choice. VIDEO We showed great resilience - Rodgers .

"Liverpool turned on the style to thrash Ludogorets Razgrad 4-0 in their first-ever UEFA Youth League match on Tuesday afternoon. Goals from Jerome Sinclair, Daniel Cleary and Alex O'Hanlon gave the Reds a commanding three-goal advantage at the break as the Bulgarians were blown away by their incisive attacking play. And Sinclair grabbed his second a couple of minutes from time to round off the perfect afternoon for Neil Critchley's youngsters at Langtree Park in St Helens. Daniel Cleary heads home Liverpool's second goal as they opened their UEFA Youth League campaign with a 4-0 rout of Bulgarians Ludogorets Razgrad at Langtree Park in St Helens .

Referee: Mervyn Smith (Northern Ireland) The Under 19 competition, in its second year, is a replica of the Champions League, with the same group pairings. Facing the weakest team first of all, Liverpool were unsurprisingly on the offensive from the first whistle and Sinclair managed to miss the target with a close-range header from Sam Hart's cross early on. Liverpool were a constant menace down the flanks, with Ryan Kent marauding on the right and Sheyi Ojo, who scored a hat-trick for the Under 21s at West Ham on his last outing, on the left. And Ojo had a hand in Liverpool's first goal after half-an-hour, finding the run of left-back Hart, who broke through the Ludogorets defence to set up Sinclair. The forward produced an accomplished finish to get the European campaign up and running. They needed just eight mintues to double that lead, with Cleary both starting and finishing the move. With a piece of improvisation, he found O'Hanlon with the outside of his boot and then headed home the return pass after finding space in the penalty area. Firmly in the ascendancy, Liverpool were three to the good just moments later. Kent sprinted forward and squared to O'Hanlon, who found the back of the net with two assured touches.

"Clive Palmer’s former accountant and friend claims that the politician’s businesses were on the brink of bankruptcy during his Federal election campaign last year. In an affidavit, Palmer's former top executive and campaigning partner Bill Schoch claims that while Mr Palmer was publically claiming to be a billionaire, his companies were experiencing a cashflow crisis. Mr Schoch alleges the companies were on the verge of corporate financial collapse and Mr Palmer was so desperate for funds that he accepted a settlement deal from the tax office just two days after the 2013 federal election. Mr Palmer’s former friend and auditor, Bill Schoch, has submitted the affidavit to the Supreme Court as he prepares for court proceedings, according to The Weekend Australian. Mr Schoch claims he has used financial documentation, corporate records and personal knowledge to compile his affidavit. Bill Schoch worked with Clive Palmer for more than thirty years, initially as his auditor and handling Palmer's tax affairs. In 2011 Palmer hired Schoch to be a salaried executive . In the documents, Mr Schoch claims that Mr Palmer narrowly avoided insolvency over a $15 million debt to a Singapore-based company, shortly before Mr Palmer won political office. It is alleged that Palmer agreed to receive around half of the $90 million amount allegedly owed to him by the tax office, to ensure his company was not left ‘without cash’. The agreement allowed him to readily access $44.9m by September 2013 to alleviate the ‘cash flow challenges’ the Palmer Group was experiencing, according to Schoch's affidavit. In his affidavit, Schoch alleges the amount Palmer’s business owed to other companies in June of last year was ‘about the equivalent of the available cash at bank’ and claims financial accounts for Palmer’s business, Mineralogy, confirms the company only had access to $16.19m, with $US15m owing. Mr Palmer allegedly owed the money to BGP Geoexplorer Pty Ltd after a two-year project, which cost a total of $US35m. Schoch claims that Palmer's businesses were on the brink of bankruptcy last year, whilst Palmer was involved campaigning for office before the 2013 Federal election . BGP Geoexplorer was contracted to undertake seismic surveying of the sea bed off Papua New Guinea, where Palmer had identified a potential billion gas region. His company Palmer Petroleum, controlled by Mineralogy, had been granted exploration rights. The affidavit follows allegations that Palmer fraudulently withdrew more than $12m to bankroll his party in the election – wrongfully using funds from a planned joined venture the Chinese government-owned company, Citic Pacific. Palmer has denied that he breached the company’s trust to siphone $10m in August and $2.167m in September of last year. He maintains the money was used appropriately for the project with Citic Pacific. Schoch has launched Supreme Court action against Palmer and two of his companies, Mineralogy and Queensland Nickel, seeking damages after he was sacked by Mr Palmer in December last year. Bill Schoch is suing his former boss for more than $4.6 million over an alleged breach of contract and misleading conduct. Clive Palmer was Bill Schoch’s friend and client for more than 30 years, until a bitter feud ensued after Schoch’s sacking in December 2013. Scoch handled Palmer’s tax affairs and audited his businesses from 1978 until 2006. In 2011 he was hired to be a salaried executive. Schoch alleges in an affidavit submitted to the Supreme Court that whilst Palmer was maintaining his public image as a multi-billionaire, he struck a settlement with the tax office to avoid insolvency . Schoch began work with Palmer in June 2011. Schoch claims Mr Palmer promised him $5 million for five years of work, on the terms that he began on a ‘starting salary for a short time, and then go up to the million a year when the money comes in.’ When Palmer sacked Schoch in December 2013, he allegedly told his former friend ‘You don’t have a contract for five years. Your f***ing contract is for $150 thousand. Leave by Tuesday. Sue me’, according to court documents. Schoch maintains that he was misled by an oral agreement with Palmer about the terms of his employment. The affidavit claims Palmer then sent Schoch an invoice, demanding Schoch pay $633,150 for the cost of Schoch’s accommodation and meals whilst Schoch worked as resident manager at Palmer’s Hyatt Regency Resort on the Sunshine Court. Schoch’s affidavit claims that Palmer’s companies were ‘running near empty’ as they were not being paid royalties by Citic Pacific. Schoch claims Palmer expected up to $500 million a year from Citic Pacific, as royalties for the mining of iron ore. However, litigation between the partners meant Palmer had allegedly largely overestimated the company’s income. Palmer had once praised Schoch for his ‘impeccable character’, but in light of Schoch's affidavit, Palmer told The Australian that Schoch is ‘just not a truthful person.’","Clive Palmer's former top executive claims Palmer's companies were on verge of BANKRUPTCY in 2013 as Palmer campaigned for office .

"Liverpool have been handed a boost after Daniel Sturridge returned to light training at Melwood as he continues his recovery from a thigh injury. The England striker had been expected to miss three weeks after suffering the injury while away on international duty but it seems his comeback could come sooner than expected. Sturridge looked comfortable jogging, turning and running with the ball as he trained alone on Wednesday morning. Daniel Sturridge was back on the training ground on Wednesday as he continues his recovery from injury . Daniel Sturridge took part in a light training session at Melwood as he steps up his recovery . The striker had been expected to miss three weeks after suffering the thigh problem with England . Sturridge limped out of a training session with England and missed their Euro 2016 qualifier in Switzerland . Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers was furious that Sturridge had not been given enough time to recover after he played 89 minutes in England's 1-0 friendly win over Norway . But manager Brendan Rodgers will be wary of throwing Sturridge back in too soon and he is likely to sit out this Saturday's visit to West Ham in the Barclays Premier League. Next Tuesday's Capital One Cup tie with Middlesbrough at Anfield could see him return if his recovery continues ahead of schedule. The rest of the Liverpool squad were given the day off following their late 2-1 win over Ludogorets Razgrad in the Champions League on Tuesday night. Sturridge trained alone at Melwood as the rest of the squad recovered from Tuesday night's Champions League match against Ludogorets Razgrad . Sturridge looked in good spirits as he laughed and joked with the coaching staff during the session .

Sturridge's injury setback caused friction between Rodgers and the England coaches, with the Liverpool manager outspoken in his belief that his recovery after playing 89 minutes in the friendly win over Norway should have been better managed.

"Cristiano Ronaldo dispelled fears he may miss Portugal's opening World Cup match with Germany by training with minimal strapping on his left knee on Friday. The Real Madrid superstar had caused concern in the camp after leaving training early on Thursday with an ice pack attached to his knee, suggesting he had not fully recovered from the problem that affected the end of his club season. The 29-year-old, who is widely predicted to be a star of the tournament in Brazil, hobbled out of Thursday's session after less than 20 minutes and watched the rest from the sidelines. Back in action: Cristiano Ronaldo trained with light strapping on his left knee 24 hours after hobbling out of Portugal training . Precaution: The Real Madrid star wasn't too restricted in his movements as he juggled the ball with his left leg . Concerns: Ronaldo left Portugal's training session on Thursday with a recurrence of his knee problem, raising doubts that he might not make the World Cup opener against Germany . Worries: Ronaldo had his knee strapped with ice after Thursday's session and was left on the sidelines . But he was back with a ball at his feet on Friday morning, playing a full part while wearing just a light strap around the affected knee. Indeed, he was at the centre of things throughout, making forceful points to Fabio Coentrao, Nani and others as they worked through their training routines. He means business: Ronaldo makes his way onto the training pitch at Portugal's Campinas base . Get it right! Ronaldo makes a forceful point to Fabio Coentrao during a practice drill .

The current Ballon d'Or winner was out of action for two weeks with tendinitis in the knee before the World Cup - an injury which had largely been kept a secret. But he still ended the season on a high, scoring Real's fourth goal in their 4-1 Champions League final win over city rivals Atletico.

"Al Qaeda has issued a new threat to carry out 'earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying' attacks on the U.S. and Europe, it emerged today. In a posting on a jihadist website, the terror group said the 'coming strikes' would target the 'heart of the land of non-belief' as well as countries aiding France in its crackdown on rebels in Mali. The unidentified writer claimed the attacks would be 'group and lone-wolf operations, in addition to the use of booby-trapped vehicles'. U.S. officials say they are taking the threat seriously. 'Targeting heart of land of non-belief': Al Qaeda has issued a new threat to carry out terrorist attacks on the U.S. and Europe in a posting on the Arabic version of this jihadist website, Ansar Al-Mujahideen . The message, posted on the Ansar al Mujahideen network on Sunday, carried the headline: 'Map of Al Qaeda and its future strikes'. It says: 'Where will the next strike by al Qaeda be? 'The answer for it, in short: The coming strikes by al Qaeda, with God’s Might, will be in the heart of the land of nonbelief, America, and in France, Denmark, other countries in Europe, in the countries that helped and are helping France, and in other places that shall be named by al Qaeda at other times.' The message, translated by The Washington Times, says the attacks will be 'strong, serious, alarming, earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying.' All attacks would be recorded and published, it added. New threat: The message warned France and it allies that they faced a 'long war of attrition' in the battle with Al Qaeda insurgents in Mali (above) It goes on to warn France and those supporting its assault on Al Qaeda insurgents in Mali that they are facing a 'long war of attrition'. The threat emerged as French troops announced yesterday they had overtaken a rebel-held airport in Kidal, northern Mali, as they begin the completion of the first phase of the military operation in the African nation. Kidal was the last urban stronghold held by the Islamist insurgents who have been in control of the greater part of northern Mali for the past ten months. France has deployed some 4,500 troops in a three-week ground and air offensive, being suported by Britain and other European forces, aimed at heading off the risk of Mali being used as a springboard for jihadist attacks in the wider region or Europe. Growing force in Africa: The moment Al Qaeda stormed a gas plant in Algeria earlier this month in a hostage crisis that led to the death of 37 foreign workers . The Ansar al-Mujahideen network has . published reliably accurate propaganda messages from Al Qaeda and its . affiliates in the past. U.S. counter-terrorism has prevented major attacks by Al Qaeda over the last ten years. The efforts also tracked down the terror group's founder, Osama bin Laden, who was shot and killed by special forces inside a residential compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan, in May, 2011. But officials warn the group continues to be dangerous, as was shown earlier this month when Al Qaeda gunmen stormed a gas plant in Algeria in a hostage crisis that led to the death of 37 foreign workers. Some . 29 of the hostage-takers also died, while three were captured by Algerian . troops during a special forces mission to end the four-day stand-off which had been carried out in revenge for the Mali operation. The attack has led to renewed fears the terror network is growing in strength in North Africa.","Threatens to carry out 'earth-shattering, shocking and terrifying' attacks .

"If you want to avoid spoilers for your favourite TV show or a movie you're planning to watch, this new website from Netflix is definitely not for you. Called ‘Living with spoilers’ it lets users watch short video clips that reveal major plot points in popular TV shows and movies - both old and new. And the site also lets people vote on which spoilers they think should be in the public domain. California-based Netflix has revealed a website that shows people spoilers. Called 'Living with spoilers' users can click through various scenes (shown). Each shows a video clip from a show that reveals a major plot point . The website is intended to be fun, rather than a serious attempt to ruin people’s enjoyment of a story. A section called ‘Spoil yourself’ lets users play a Russian roulette-style game where they click through a series of spoilers. Within the next decade, the online video market as we know it could be turned on its head with no more adverts, no more channels, and no more menus. That’s according to Netflix’s chief product officer Neil Hunt. He predicts that by ‘2025 or sooner’ services such as his own, will have mastered personalisation to the point where sites know what users want to watch before they sign in. And everyone will get their own, dedicated channel. Each click reveals a new major plot point from a TV show or movie hosted on Netflix. The spoilers in this section are voted for by members of the public. They can vote for specific moments from shows and movies and decide if a specific spoiler should be hosted in the roulette-style game. For example, quotes from The Hunger Games can be approved or rejected for inclusion in the public domain of spoilers. While most of the spoilers involve classic films, some more recent shows such as Breaking Bad are also included - so viewers should steer clear if they're wary of what they might see. Elsewhere on the site, users can take part in a quiz to find out what type of ‘spoiler’ they are. The questions determine whether they enjoying ruining shows for others, or if they do it accidentally. Users can vote on the spoilers that appear on the website (shown) and decide which scenes should be approved. They can also take a quiz to find out what type of 'spoiler' they are. This quiz ask questions to determine whether they enjoying ruining shows for others, or if they do it accidentally . Spoilers featured include classic movies such as 1987 hit Good Morning Vietnam (pictured) starring Robin Williams (left) and James Thomas Patrick Walsh (right) The release of the site followed a transatlantic online study into spoilers commissioned by Netflix. It showed that less than four per cent of people in the UK think it’s okay to spoil programmes for others, while 76 per cent of Americans say spoilers are a fact of life. By comparison only 24 per cent of Brits thought we should have to put up with spoulers. And 58 per cent of Brits felt guilty if they spoiled a major plot twist to someone else, compared to just 37 per cent of Americans. Author and cultural anthropologist Dr Grant McCracken helped Netflix to make the findings; he went into the living rooms of TV viewers in the UK and US to get an in-depth understanding of their viewing behaviour. ‘The UK has a rich history of making great TV. And over the past few years, writers and showrunners from other countries have started creating complex and morally challenging TV, too,’ said Dr McCracken. ‘This new and improved TV is forcing a change in the way, the urgency, with which we talk about TV. ‘TV has, in effect, become more provocative of spoilers and more worthy of them. ‘While Brits are still more conservative in their TV conversation, we are seeing a less censored TV fan emerging here in the UK.’ The survery in the UK was carried out by YouGov in July 2014 and involved 2,421 men and women over 18 years of age, while in the US Harris Poll spoke to 2,023 adults in August.","California-based Netflix has revealed a website that shows people spoilers .

"French troops have overtaken a rebel-held airport in Kidal, northern Mali, as they begin the completion of the first phase of the military operation in the African nation. Kidal was the last urban stronghold held by the Islamist insurgents who have been control of the greater part of northern Mali for the past ten months. France has deployed some 4,500 troops in a three-week ground and air offensive aimed at heading off the risk of Mali being used as a springboard for jihadist attacks in the wider region or Europe. Victorious: French troops patrol the northern city of Gao today, a key Islamist stronghold until it was retaken by French and Malian troops over the weekend . As the first phase of the mission comes to an end, French military plans to gradually hand over to a larger African force, tasked with rooting out insurgents in their mountain redoubts near Algeria's border. Defence Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said French forces using planes and helicopters defied a sandstorm late on Tuesday to capture the airport but had been prevented by the bad weather from entering the town itself. ‘The terrorist forces are pulling back to the Adrar des Ifoghas mountains which are difficult to access,’ Le Drian told a news conference. ‘There is support from Chadian and Nigerian troops coming from the south.’ The deployment of French troops to remote Kidal puts them in direct contact with pro-autonomy Tuareg MNLA rebels, whose rebellion last year was hijacked by the Islamist radicals. Le Drian said France had established good relations with local Tuareg chieftains before sending in troops. MNLA leaders say they are ready to fight al Qaeda but many Malians, including the powerful military top brass in the capital Bamako, blame them for the division of the country. They view Paris' liaisons with the Tuaregs with suspicion. Freedom fire: A man smokes several cigarettes at once as he celebrates the French recapturing of Ansongo, a town south of the northern Malian city of Gao . Celebration: Unveiled Malian girls sing and play in Gao, in celebration of French and Malian troops' victory over the rebels . French and Malian troops retook the major Saharan trading towns of Gao and Timbuktu at the weekend. There were fears that many thousands of priceless ancient manuscripts held in Timbuktu, a UNESCO World Heritage site, might have been lost during the rebel occupation, but experts said the bulk of the texts were safe. The United States and European governments strongly support the Mali intervention and are providing logistical and surveillance backing but do not intend to send combat troops. The MNLA rebels, who want greater autonomy for the desert north, said they had moved fighters into Kidal after Islamists left the town earlier this week. ‘For the moment, there is a coordination with the French troops,’ said Moussa Ag Assarid, the MNLA spokesman in Paris. A spokesman for the Malian army said its soldiers were securing Gao and Timbuktu and were not heading to Kidal. The MNLA took up arms against the Bamako government a year ago, seeking to carve out a new independent desert state. Rebel war: A Tuareg man holds a bullet near a destroyed vehicle belonging to Islamist rebels on the road between Diabaly and Timbuktu in Mali today . After initially fighting alongside the Islamists, by June they had been forced out by their better armed and financed former allies, who include al Qaeda North Africa's wing, AQIM, a splinter wing called MUJWA and Ansar Dine, a Malian group. Although the first phase of the military operation is over, doubts remain about just how quickly the U.N.-backed African intervention force can be fully deployed in Mali to hunt down the retreating al Qaeda-allied insurgents. Known as AFISMA, the force is now expected to exceed 8,000 troops. Foreign Minister Laurent Fabius said France's military operation, codenamed Serval (Wildcat), was planned as a lightning mission lasting a few weeks. ‘Liberating Gao and Timbuktu very quickly was part of the plan. Now it's up to the African countries to take over,’ he told the Le Parisien daily. ‘We decided to put in the means and the necessary number of soldiers to strike hard. But the French contingent will not stay like this. We will leave very quickly.’ One French soldier has been killed in the mission, and Fabius warned that things could now get more difficult, as the offensive seeks to flush out insurgents with experience of fighting in the desert from their wilderness hideouts. Approval: A soldier in the Mali government force gives the thumbs up as reports came of French forces taking the most northern town of Kidal . Freed: Malians cheering French and Mali forces as they arrive in Gao after overtaking the Islamist rebels who have been in control of most of northern Mali for ten months . ‘We have to be careful. We are entering a complicated phase where the risks of attacks or kidnappings are extremely high. French interests are threatened throughout the entire Sahel.’ The French operation has destroyed the Islamists' training camps and logistics bases but analysts say a long term solution for Mali hinges on finding a political settlement between the northern communities and the southern capital Bamako. Interim President Dioncounda Traore said on Tuesday his government would aim to hold national elections on July 31. Paris is pushing strongly for Traore's government to hold talks with the MNLA, which has dropped its claims for independence. ‘The Malian authorities must begin without delay talks with the legitimate representatives of the northern population and non-terrorist armed groups that recognise Mali's integrity,’ French Foreign ministry spokesman Philippe Lalliot said. After months of being kept on the political sidelines, the MNLA said they were in contact with West African mediators who are trying to forge a national settlement to reunite Mali. ‘We reiterate that we are ready to talk with Bamako and to find a political solution. We want self-determination, but all that will be up to negotiations which will determine at what level both parties can go,’ Ag Assarid said. There have been cases in Gao and Timbuktu and other recaptured towns of reprisal attacks and looting of shops and residences belonging to Malian Tuaregs and Arabs suspected of sympathising with the MNLA and the Islamist rebels.","French military seized the airport in Islamist rebel stronghold town Kidal .

"For wealthy Victorians, visiting pyramids built by the Ancient Egyptians was one of the highlights in their grand tours. But now anyone can wander round the last of the Seven Wonders of the World from the comfort of their sofa, because Google has added pyramids and other sites in Giza, Egypt, to Google Street View.

Features of these landmarks and others in the Giza Necropolis can be seen up close in the Google Street View images and there are also glimpses of horses and carriages and market stalls around the historic sites. The Great Pyramid was built as a tomb and a symbol of eternity for the Pharaoh Khufu. It stands 456ft (139 metres) high – just over nine double decker buses stacked on top of one another.

Ancient pyramids dominate the skyline of the Sahara, while camels carry tourists to see the amazing sites . Purrfect shot? To the east of the pyramids sits the Great Sphinx, which is the oldest and largest known monumental sculpture in the world. With the body of a lion and the head of a human, it measures a grand 239ft (73 metres) long and 65ft (20 metres) high. The  creature is believed to resemble Pharaoh Khafre . Palm-fringed fortress: The Citadel of Qaitbay, a 15th-century defensive fortress perched atop the Mediterranean coast,  has also been caught on camera .

"Analysis of an ancient pelt buried with the remains of a Bronze Age princess has revealed that bears once roamed the hills of Dartmoor, experts have claimed . The animal skin was discovered inside a bog in 2011 on White Horse Hill. It was found wrapped around objects in the grave, including a woven basket and cremated human remains. All the finds discovered at the . 4,000-year-old site, including the fur and exotic beads, indicate the . grave was for a person of high status. Archaeologists believe that wild brown bears once lived on Dartmoor, after discovering a 4,000-year old fur pelt (pictured) buried with the remains of a Bronze Age princess . ‘It’s entirely possible bears were living in the local area,' said Fiona . Pitt, curator of Plymouth Museum, where the grave finds are on show. ‘We . think bears were spread around Britain at the time. Their natural . habitat was around woodland so they may have been around Dartmoor.’ Typical DNA analysis methods failed because of the effect of the bog . on the pelt, so it was sent to the Smithsonian Institute in the US where a . process called peptide mass fingerprinting was used. Vanessa . Straker, English Heritage’s science advisor for the South West said: . ‘Finding the right technique to analyse it took some time. The pelt was found in 2011 in a peat bog on White Horse Hill wrapped around artefacts found in the grave, including a woven basket containing precious amber beads and earrings, as well as the cremated remains of a Bronze Age princes (actor pictured) Fiona Pitt, curator of Plymouth Museum, where the grave finds are on show, said: 'It's entirely possible bears were living in the local area. We think bears were spread around Britain at the time. Their natural habitat was around woodland so they may have been around Dartmoor' Despite there being about 200 burial cists on Dartmoor, the moor has offered up few secrets before due to grave robbing. ‘This is the most outstanding site to have been excavated locally in over 100 years,’ said Ms Pitt of Plymouth Museum. ‘The items that were discovered in the cist are of national and international importance and provide one of the best glimpses into life in Bronze Age southern England that academics and scientists have ever had.’ They are now on show at Plymouth Museum. The results indicated that the pelt once belonged to a brown bear. ‘We . thought it would be one of the easiest finds to identify - it looked . very well preserved - but these things are so rarely preserved at all . that we have little experience of working on them.’ Other discoveries at the 4,000-year-old site include a hoard of about 150 beads. 'Some . of the beads were made from amber which would have been traded from . abroad, suggesting a person of high social status,' said Ms Pitt. In February, experts said that the buried artefacts could have belonged to a Bronze Age princess. The . basket held a collection of precious beads, wooden earrings and a flint . flake, shedding light on an advanced society capable of amazing . craftsmanship and international trade. The objects were the subject of a BBC . 2 documentary in March called 'Mystery on the Moor,' in which viewers saw . the coiled bag opened for . the the first time in 4,000 years. The basket (pictured) is around 4,000 years old and held a collection of ancient beads, wooden earrings and a flink flake, shedding light on a Bronze Age society capable of amazing craftsmanship and international trade . The objects were pulled from a prehistoric cremation burial chamber (pictured) in Devon and have allowed scientists to get one of the best glimpses into life in Bronze Age Southern England . Intriguing finds including prehistoric wooden earrings (pictured right), beads (also pictured), a studded bracelet and a near perfectly animal pelt have just gone on show at a new exhibition . The basket bag is fashioned from two circular . disks measuring 4.5 inches (12cm) in diameter to form a flat base and . lid, which is joined by a tube made using a coiled basketry technique . with cow hair stitching around the edge and was preserved in peat. The . wooden earrings inside, which measure up to an inch (2.5cm) in . diameter, have side grooves and are made from spindle wood – a hard, . fine grained tree that grows in Dartmoor which is traditionally used to . make knitting needles. The wooden earrings (pictured) measure up to two-and-a-half centimetres in diameter and and are made from spindle wood - a hard, fine grained tree that grows in Dartmoor which is traditionally used to make knitting needles . ‘The studs are unique in British . prehistory; they also represent the earliest evidence for wood turning . in the UK,’ experts at the Dartmoor National Park Authority said. Archaeologists . are used the objects to build up a picture of the person who was buried . at the site on Whitehorse Hill and it is thought they were of . considerable importance in the local community. They . speculate that the items, which also include precious jewellery, . belonged to a women between the ages of 14 and 25-years-old, who was . probably a princess. An . expert at Dartmoor National Park Authority told MailOnline that . archaeologists came to this conclusion as other lesser, comparable items . have been founded in prehistoric cairns. The princess was of incredibly high social standing, as evidenced by the high position of her final resting place 600 metres above sea level on the northern moors, which would have been visible to nearby settlements and the valuable items that were buried with her. A delicate woven bracelet with tin studs (pictured) was also unearthed. A total of 35 tin studs were held in place by a band of woven cow hair (although 32 remain). While the metal has oxidized, it would have been shiny in appearance . The ancient burial chamber (pictured) was deliberately positioned high upon a hill to show the princess' high status, experts said. They expect to find a settlement nearby . Bronze Age Britons were skilled at making tin and might have traded it with other far flung communities. They used to create elaborate jewellery, such as the delicate bracelet that was found. Other materials found at the site - including amber beads - show that people traded internationally. A stone flint also discovered, showed that while people used bronze tools, there were also still using earlier tools, which again, would probably have been traded. High status individuals were revered and were buried in elaborate burial chambers with precious possessions. It is not known how many people the princess would have ruled over but Dartmoor was well inhabited 4,000 years ago. The remains of 5,000 hut circles - Bronze Age houses have been discovered so far that had conical thatched roofs. Archaeologists have previously found small clusters of these houses in fenced enclosures that would have protected people from animals. People at the time had advanced cultural and religious beliefs. High status people also took care with their appearance and wore carefully crafted clothes and jewellery from fur pelts to tin beaded bracelets. Archaeologists first stumbled across . the chamber a decade ago when a stone fell out of the peat hag which had . been concealing it – far from other known prehistoric sites. 'The . find fills in the blanks of the local map in terms of Bronze Age . settlements, as before there was little evidence of inhabitation, so . there must be a settlement nearby,' one local expert told MailOnline. 'There's much more to discover in the area,' he said. A skilfully-made decorative sash or belt was folded around the cremated remains along with the pelt. It is composed of . textile and leather with a fringe of outward pointing leather triangles . made from thin calf skin. But the discovery of beads made of tin initially got archaeologists particularly excited because they are the earliest evidence of tin production found in the South West. Over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber. The precious material from the Baltic was associated with supernatural powers and used as an amulet, which therefore suggests a very high status burial as well as demonstrating that Bronze Age Britons traded with people from the continent. A delicate woven bracelet with tin studs was also unearthed. A total of 35 tin studs are held in place by a band of woven cow hair. While the metal has oxidized, it would have been shiny in appearance. ‘The use of tin for decorative objects . is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in Britain and . despite tin being a locally available resource on Dartmoor, this is the . first time it has been found within a prehistoric archaeological . context,’ local experts said. Ms Pitt said: ‘This is the most outstanding site to have been excavated locally in over 100 years.' ‘The . items that were discovered in the cist are of national and . international importance and provide one of the best glimpses into life . in Bronze Age southern England that academics and scientists have ever . had.’ The artefacts have just gone on display at Plymouth City Museum and Art Gallery. Over 200 beads were plucked from and around the basket and some are made from amber, demonstrating international trade as the precious material comes from the Baltic. The grey beads are made from shale and the centre bead from tin - another precious material showing the wearer was of high social status . Here, a model wears modern replicas of what the prehistoric jewellery is thought to have looked like. The use of tin for decorative objects is exceptionally rare within prehistoric burial contexts in Britain and has not been discovered before .","Bear pelt was among a hoard of Bronze Age treasure unearthed in Dartmoor .

"Fresh evidence has been uncovered for the theory that our moon was created by a collision between Earth and a planet-sized object some 4.5 billion years ago. German scientists studied moon rocks gathered by astronauts nearly a half-century ago in the Apollo 11, 12 and 16 missions. They say the results show Earth was hit by a huge object called 'Theia' which led to the moon's formation. Scroll down for video . Researchers analysed various kinds of oxygen atoms and found the moon rocks have a different makeup than Earth rocks do . Many researchers believe the moon formed after Earth was hit by a planet the size of Mars billions of years ago. This is called the giant impact hypothesis. The hypothesis claims the moon is debris left over following an indirect collision between our planet and an astronomical body approximately 4.5 billion years ago. The colliding body is sometimes called Theia, after the mythical Greek Titan who was the mother of Selene, the goddess of the Moon. They analysed various kinds of oxygen atoms and found the moon rocks have a different makeup than Earth rocks do. The idea that the moon was created in this way has been called the 'Giant Impact Hypothesis.' The results also suggest that the moon may be a 50-50 mix of material from this object and from Earth. That fits with the idea that the moon would contain material from the object that struck Earth. 'I think that most people believe in the Giant Impact Hypothesis,' said the study's lead author, Daniel Herwartz, a geologist at Georg-August-Universität in Göttingen, Germany. 'And now that we have solved one of the last gaps in explaining it, those who criticise it will have a hard time.' The study was published in the journal Science. Previous efforts to confirm that the impact had taken place had centred on measuring the ratios between the isotopes of oxygen, titanium, silicon and others. These ratios are known to vary throughout the solar system, but their close similarity between Earth and Moon conflicted with theoretical models of the collision that indicated that the Moon would form mostly from Theia, and would be expected to be compositionally different from the Earth. The German researchers used more refined techniques to compare the ratios in lunar samples, with those from Earth. A thin section of an enstatite chondrite fragment from the asteroid Almahatta Sitta, found  on 7 October 2008 in the Nubian Desert, Sudan. It was analysed for the initial research. The team initially used lunar samples which had arrived on Earth via meteorites, but as these samples had exchanged their isotopes with water from Earth, fresher samples were sought. These were provided by Nasa from the Apollo 11, 12 and 16 missions; they were found to contain significantly higher levels of 17O/16O than their Earthly counterparts. 'The differences are small and difficult to detect, but they are there,' said Dr Herwartz said. Evidence suggests the illustrated formation theory is how the moon came to be . Impacts on the Moon can eject lunar material, which may then fall . to the Earth. Kalahari 008 is an approximately 600g meteorite from the Moon that was collected . in 1999 in the Kalahari Desert, Botswana and used in the study. 'This means two things; firstly we can now be reasonably sure that the Giant collision took place. Secondly, it gives us an idea of the geochemistry of Theia. 'Theia seems to have been similar to what we call E-type chondrites. 'If this is true, we can now predict the geochemical and isotopic composition of the moon, because the present moon is a mixture of Theia and the early Earth. Using measurements from the interior of Earth, coupled with  computer simulations, an international team of planetary scientists earlier this year claimed the moon, pictured, formed 95 million years after the formation of the solar system, 4.6 billion years ago - plus or minus 32 to 39 million years . 'The next goal is to find out how much material of Theia is in the moon.' Most models estimate that the moon it is composed of around 70% to 90% material from Theia, with the remaining 10% to 30% coming from the early Earth. However, some models argue for as little as 8% Theia in the moon. Dr Herwartz said that the new data indicate that a 50-50 mixture seems possible, but this needs to be confirmed.","After the solar system formed 4.6 billion years ago, Earth was said to have been hit by a Mars-sized planet .

"A nasty polar vortex that wreaked havoc on the east coast in January is making a shock return next week - though don't pull out your puffer coat just yet. Unseasonably chilly air is headed for parts of the northern and northeastern U.S. where residents have been sweltering in 90 degree weather this week - as one would expect in July. Thankfully, families won't be plunged into the despair they endured during January's brutally cold weather pattern. But the looming conditions bear some resemblance, so much so that meteorologists are dubbing this the polar vortex sequel. Polar vortex: A cold front set to hit the Midwest next week is NOT another polar vortex, just unseasonably chilly weather . Cooling off: Six-year-old Chance Seeds runs through the water at the splash pad at McEuen Park in Coeur d'Alene, Idaho on Thursday. But the weather is set to turn chillier soon . According to the Washington Post, a deep pool of cool air from Alaska and Canada will plunge into the Great Lakes early next week. From there it'll move towards the east coast. Because we're in July - the peak of summer - rather than bitter mid-winter, temperatures are expected to drop 10-30 degrees below average, so the polar vortex's 'lite' won't have quite the same effect. But it certainly will be chilly than normal, requiring hoodies and jeans in parts of the Great Lakes and Upper Midwest where the coolest air is expected and highs are forecast to be in the 60s and 70s tops - a sharp difference from the 80s and 90s of recent weeks. On Wednesday morning, the lows may drop into the 40s over a large part of the central U.S., which is extremely unusual in July. According . to the Post, the coolest temps will likely miss the east coast, but . highs are still forecast to be 10 degrees below normal, struggling to . reach 80 in D.C. next Tuesday and Wednesday with widespread lows in the . 50s. January chill: The winter Polar Vortex brought freezing temperatures and mountains of snow to much of the Midwest and Northeast . The relatively cooler air may also be felt in New York, according to ABC News. The brief weather pattern could even break records around the Plains and Great Lakes. Weather Underground meteorologist Jeff Masters told the Post that Japan's typhoon Neoguri is playing a role in how the polar vortex is coming together. '.... the large and powerful nature of this storm has set in motion a chain-reaction set of events that will dramatically alter the path of the jet stream and affect weather patterns across the entire Northern Hemisphere next week,' he said. 'Neoguri will cause an acceleration of the North Pacific jet stream, causing a large amount of warm, moist tropical air to push over the North Pacific. This will amplify a trough low pressure over Alaska, causing a ripple effect in the jet stream over western North America, where a strong ridge of high pressure will develop, and over the Midwestern U.S., where a strong trough of low pressure will form.'","Unseasonably chilly air is headed for parts of the northern and northeastern U.S. where residents have been sweltering in 90 degree heat .

"Tiny human hearts that beat of their own accord are being grown by scientists at Abertay University in Scotland. They . have been developed specifically to find a cure for heart hypertrophy - a form . of heart disease that can lead to sudden death. Made from stem cells, the miniature hearts are just 0.04 inches (one millimetre) in diameter and contract at around 30 beats per minute. Scroll down for video . Tiny human hearts that beat of their own accord (pictured) are being grown by scientists at Abertay University in Scotland. They have been developed specifically to find a cure for heart hypertrophy - a form of heart disease that enlarges the organ and can lead to sudden death . Although healthy to begin with, the scientists are using chemicals to simulate the physiological conditions that will make them become hypertrophic - enlarged - due to abnormal growth of the cells that make up the heart. In April scientists discovered a way to block the formation of excess cholesterol that leads to heart disease. Working with mice and rabbits, Johns Hopkins scientists successfully prevented the development of atherosclerosis, the main cause of heart attacks and strokes and the number-one cause of death among humans. The condition develops when fat builds inside blood vessels over time and renders them stiff, narrowed and hardened, greatly reducing their ability to feed oxygen-rich blood to the heart muscle and the brain. Once diseased, the hearts are then treated with newly developed medications to see if they can prevent the damage from occurring. ‘Although human hearts have been grown in labs before, this is the first time it has ever been possible to induce disease in them,' said Professor Nikolai Zhelev, who is leading the research. ‘Heart hypertrophy can be hereditary, can be caused by diseases such as diabetes, or can be caused by doing too much strenuous exercise. ‘The disease causes the heart muscle to thicken and stiffen, and makes it harder for the heart to pump blood around the body. ‘In some people, a life-threatening abnormal heart rhythm will develop, and this is the most common cause of sudden death in young people. ‘Although there are treatments, these only help to control the symptoms, and there is no known cure at the moment.’ Made from stem cells, the miniature hearts are just 0.04 inches (one millimetre) in diameter and contract at around 30 beats per minute. Pictured here are miniature hearts 'in vitro', which means they are studied with cells of biological molecules outside their normal biological context . However, the miniature hearts being grown in Professor Zhelev’s lab could help change that. Using biosensors, Professor Zhelev was able to label specific molecules within the miniature hearts to see how the research should be led. By establishing which molecules cause the hearts to become hypertrophic, he has been able to target drugs at these molecules and prevent them from going down the path they would usually take - and prevent them from becoming hypertrophic. He added: ‘We’ve tested a number of different compounds on these hearts - some of them entirely new ones that haven’t been tested in humans yet, which is why we’re testing them on these hearts we’ve grown in the lab. ‘One of these compounds, however, is a drug that we have developed which has just completed phase-two clinical trials in cancer patients and has had very positive results. ‘Although heart cells are the only ones in the body that will never get cancer, we noticed that the pathways the molecules in hypertrophic hearts follow are similar to those followed by molecules in cancerous cells, so we thought testing this new drug on these hearts might have the same positive effect.' And, said Professor Zhelev, this has proved to be the case. Although healthy to begin with, the scientists are using chemicals to simulate the physiological conditions that will make hearts enlarged due to abnormal growth of the cells. Pictured here are cariomyocytes, muscle cells, in the tiny hearts . ‘Some of the compounds we’ve tested have had undesirable effects,' he continued, 'such as increasing the number of beats the hearts do per minute and making them stop beating.' But he explained that other compounds, such as a new cancer drug in development, managed to protect the hearts and prevent them from becoming enlarged. ‘We are still testing new drugs using this system to find new compounds with better efficiency and fewer side-effects,' he said. ‘Once we know exactly which compounds work and which don’t we’ll begin developing new drugs which will then undergo further tests, before eventually being trialled in humans. ‘Although there is still a long way to go before the drugs become available commercially, we are extremely hopeful that we will one day be able to stop heart hypertrophy from developing in those at risk of the disease.’","Tiny human .

"He's been to some high places in his time, but now Snoop Dogg has turned even the White House green - by lighting a cannabis joint in the bathroom. The rapper claimed he reassured Secret Service agents he would only be igniting a 'napkin' before having a luxurious solo smoke on a recent visit. If his story is true he joins the likes of country singer Willie Nelson, who famously lit up a joint at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue during the presidency of Jimmy Carter. Scroll down for video .

When asked about his habit in 2006, Barack Obama famously replied: 'I inhaled frequently. That was the point.' The confession was made on Snoop Dogg's GGN ('Double G News Network') Youtube show during an appearance by comedian and talk show host Jimmy Kimmel.

Kimmel laughed and asked: 'Who said this, the First Lady?' Snoop replied: 'Nah, the CIA. Or the FBI. The alphabet boys. 'So I said look, when I do a number two I usually have a cigarette or light something to get the aroma right.

"New face in the neighborhood: Oprah Winfrey bought a 66-acre plot of land for $10.85million . A retired nuclear physicist has filed a lawsuit because he feels that his new neighbor, Oprah Winfrey, is planning to cut off access to public hiking trails. Charles Goodman has filed a lawsuit against a host of individuals involved in the sale of 66-acres of land next to his Telluride, Colorado summer home to the media mogul. Winfrey purchased the ski-in, ski-out property in March for $10.85million under one of her subsidiary companies, Yellow Brick Road CO LLC, and now their last-minute dealings to make changes to the long-respected public trail agreements is under new scrutiny. 'I don't care if Oprah is a neighbor, but if she is going to cut off access to trails, I don't find that acceptable,' Mr Goodman told The Denver Post. Winfrey is expected to build a main mansion on the property as well as a guest house, but that is not the only construction that is due to start in the coming months. Between 800 and 1,000 trees will be cut from the property, a new bridge will be built over a ski run to allow easier access and new roads will be paved. Mr Goodman's lawsuit does not take issue with any of the architect's plans, but pertains specifically to the predicted prevention of access to the long-public hiking trails. The 86-year-old physicist bought his home in the development in 1972 and he was one of the driving forces to create hiking trails in the property that sits next to the development. Under dispute: Dr Goodman has filed a suit over the potential changes to the public rights access to hiking trails he helped establish in the area near his home . Incursion: One of the public trails that runs through the 66 acres Winfrey purchased is Galloping Goose Trail . 'Yellow Brick Road CO LLC will continue to work with the residents of the Ski Ranches HOA to enable them to have reasonable access over portions of the company's recently acquired property for recreational trail use,' Yellow Brick Road spokeswoman Wendy Luckenbill told The Denver Post via email. Taking issue: Charles Goodman, a retired nuclear physicist, has owned a summer home next to Winfrey's new lot since 1972 and helped found the trails in 1989 . 'It is our hope that we can work together on a usage plan that is mutually agreeable.' The Denver Post reports that in 1989, when the trails were created, the land belonged to the U.S. Forest Service. The land was later given to Telluride Ski Co. but only under the provision that the trails would remain open to the public and not hindered in any way. Since then, the land was legally redistricted so that it became a part of the neighboring town, Mountain Village, and parts- including the property that Oprah went on to purchase- were sold to individuals who wished to build homes. Oprah's specific land went to Hoyt and Carol Barnett who bought the land in the 1990s. Throughout all of the turnovers, there was always specific language that preserves public access to the trails. That included a 2005 re-mapping of the area while still under the Barnett's ownership, where the trails were incorporated into the map. Mr Goodman has included the Barnetts in his lawsuit because they allegedly asked to change the stipulations to that 2005 document, called a plat, before selling the land to Oprah's company but without notifying any of the residents- including Goodman- who would be effected. 'One month before Oprah closed on the property, the rights of way disappeared entirely,' Mr Goodman's lawyer Robert Korn told The Denver Post. Familiar: Oprah Winfrey first bought property in the area in 1994 when she purchased this cabin in with a view of the San Juan Mountains . Out in nature: Telluride, Colorado draws visitors throughout the year with skiers in winter and hikers in the summer, and the public access to hiking trails is a major part of the tourism industry in the area . Local districting officials argued that when they were approached by the TV mogul's legal team ahead of the March sale, they only clarified the language used in the 2005 'replatting' and did not inherently change the public access rights. 'The town is supportive of continued access to Prospect Basin. And we are working with (Winfrey's) team, and it is pretty clear they want to continue access,' Mountain Village director of community development Chris Hawkins told The Denver Post. Mr Hawkins and the Mountain village mayor are also named in Mr Goodman's lawsuit, as well as the Barnetts and Winfrey's Yellow Brick Road Co. One of the trails that Mr Goodman argues is under seige is Galloping Goose Trail, which extends for 6.7 miles and is used by hikers, bikers, and joggers who don't mind a bit of elevation with their daily run.

"Three large solar flares over the last two days have released a huge cloud of particles from the sun which could knock out satellites and communication systems on Earth. A 'coronal mass ejection' (CME), a huge cloud of irradiated particles and a magnetic shockwave, could strike the planet on Friday, damaging satellites and knocking out communications. The three solar flares already caused brief disruptions to high frequency communications, such as radio broadcasts and aircraft communications, when they struck yesterday and twice on Tuesday. Scroll down for video . The sun has emitted three intense solar flares in just two days. Two on Tuesday (left and centre) and one on Wednesday (right), disrupting military radio and aircraft communications . The sun emitted two X-grade solar flares on Tuesday morning at 7.42am and 8.52am - X being the most powerful kind of solar flare - and a third X-class flare early yesterday. Solar flares are largely harmless, as Earth's atmosphere absorbs most of the harmful particles they emit. However they can cause satellites to malfunction, and disrupt the layer of atmosphere some communications pass through, causing interruptions. But if the CME strikes, then the damage could be far more severe. CME's can cause huge electrical surges, knocking out power grids and causing pylon cables to overload and snap. Events on this scale are unlikely, as the NOAA says the CME due on Friday will only strike a 'glancing blow', but satellites could be affected, leading to a drop in mobile phone signal. The last major CME to hit Earth came in 1859 when compasses were knocked out as Earth's magnetic field was disrupted. But the flares also released a 'coronal mass ejection', a huge cloud of irradiated particles and a magnetic shockwave which could hit Earth on Friday, potentially knocking out mobile phone satellites and GPS . The Aurora Borealis was also visible as far south as Cuba as particles from the sun bounced off of Earth's atmosphere. Because the last major CME happened before the planet was dependent on electronics for our day-to-day lives, little is known about what the real impact would be. But it is likely that large electronics would be badly affected, causing weeks or months of disruptions to power supplies, phone networks and the internet which could cost billions to repair. Small electronics, such as mobile phones and computers, would likely be unaffected, but would be rendered almost useless with large networks knocked out.

"A woman stripped of her Miss Delaware title last month for being too old is suing state pageant officials and the Miss America organization. In a lawsuit filed Tuesday, Amanda Longacre is seeking to be reinstated as Miss Delaware and to be allowed to compete in the Miss America pageant. She also is seeking $500,000 in damages for herself and $2.5 million for other contestants who she claims were recruited to compete in pageants before being told they were too old. Scroll down for videos . Lawsuit: Amanda Longacre is seeking to be reinstated as Miss Delaware and to be allowed to compete in the Miss America pageant . Longacre is also seeking $500,000 in damages for herself and $2.5million for other contestants who she claims were recruited to compete in pageants before being told they were too old . Officials say Miss America pageant rules require contestants to be between 17 and 24. Longacre turns 25 on October 22, after this year's national pageant. The lawsuit alleges that one or more other contestants in the 2014 Miss Delaware pageant also were too old to compete under those rules. 'It is a lawsuit without merit and we will defend it vigorously,' said Sharon Pearce, president of the Miss America organization. State pageant representatives did not immediately respond to messages seeking comment Wednesday. The Miss Delaware crown was given to runner-up Brittany Lewis. In June, Ms Longacre told Today: 'I won the title of Miss Delaware, I am Miss Delaware. I have been nothing but honest from the beginning. I did not know that rule. I asked from the beginning if I was eligible and they said yes, they signed off on my contract, they had my birth certificate, I gave them everything.' Miss Longacre sobbed on camera saying she was devastated at losing the chance to represent the people of Delaware . The 24-year-old wept on camera last week as she described the heartache of losing her coveted title. However she is allowed to keep a $9,000 scholarship award which was part of her winnings. The Penn State graduate said on Monday: 'I've gotten a lot of support and I'm so appreciative of it. I feel so much love from my state, and even from outside of my state people have been supporting me. 'I've been nothing but honest since the beginning and they don't think it's right either.' She added: 'This is about the title of Miss Delaware that I rightfully won. I want to represent the people of Delaware. I want to be a social worker. This was a great start to a fabulous career for me and it's still going to be a fabulous career for me.' She said that although the age rule is in her contract, she assumed she was eligible because the Miss Delaware organization signed off. 'I didn't know the rule, I also competed at the local level and it's been several months. You put your trust in an organization to know their own rules. So when you come forward and you're honest and you put the time and money in, this is not fair.' In a statement to MailOnline, the Miss Delaware Scholarship Organization said: 'Following the Miss Delaware Pageant, it was determined that Amanda Longacre exceeded the age requirement in order to be eligible to compete therefore, the Miss Delaware 2014 title is awarded to Brittany Lewis. 'The Miss Delaware Pageant is proud to congratulate Brittany and wishes Amanda the very best on her future endeavors.'","Amanda Longacre was stripped of her Miss Delaware title last month .

"A New York City teacher has been fired after asking for relationship advice about her two boyfriends from fourth graders, investigators say. Substitute teacher Cassandre Fiering, 45, even had the students role-play conversations with her about how she should talk to the men, who were both in their 30s, according to the kids - who were ages nine and ten. She allegedly told them that they were her 'munchkins' and invited them to dress up like 'demons' and scare one of her boyfriends and 'toilet-paper' his house. Fired: Cassandre Fiering, 45, was fired after investigators found she solicited her students for relationship advice . Ms Fiering called the Department of Education report 'lies' and vowed to fight her firing. She said the conversation was 'G-rated' and the students had fun . The bizarre counseling session happened in June 2013 at Public School 189 in the Bronx, New York, DNA Info reports. A report from the city Department of Education Special Commissioner of Investigation also alleged that she touched one student on the shoulder and touch two others on their thighs. Ms Fiering says she was stuck with five fourth graders all day with no lesson plan. The rest of the class had gone on a field trip. She was paid less than $155 for the day. She disputed the findings of the report and promised to hire a lawyer to fight her firing. 'The report is blatant lies,' Ms Fiering, who also works as an actress, told the New York Daily News. 'We were talking about relationships, it was all theoretical. It was an all-day situation and I was in the room for seven hours without a lesson plan.' Mrs Fiering has since ended her relationship with both of the men - though the students actually gave sound advice . 'It was also G-rated,” she told DNA Info. 'I certainly wasn’t talking about sex or anything.' For what it's worth - the kids seemed to give good relationship advice. They told her to ditch the younger man, a mechanic, who wasn't returning her calls. 'The younger guy was just a weird guy and I never really figured it out,' Ms Fiering told DNA Info. 'He was very strange and it upset me. He gave a lot of mixed messages. I think I just had to give up.' The older guy didn't work out either for the Rhode Island-native. 'He still calls and still likes me,' she said. 'He’s very sweet, but not really right for me.'","Cassandre Fiering was substitute teaching in the Bronx, New York, when she asked her students for relationship advice .

"Indestructible? New iPhones will reportedly feature a sapphire screen which is impervious to most damage . For millions of us, it’s one of the perils of modern life. You’re going about your daily business when your expensive smartphone slips out your pocket, hitting the ground with a thud. If you’re lucky, your beloved gadget is fine. If you’re not, the screen is scratched. Or, worse, the glass is cracked, leaving you with a repair bill that can be more than £200. Is there nothing that can be done, you fume, to make smartphones sturdy enough for the real lives of the people who use them? At last, some good news is on the way. Apple, the technology company that has sold an incredible 500 million iPhones since they went on sale in 2007, is expected to launch its iPhone 6 next month. And their latest model improves on the versions that came before it in one crucial way: a ‘virtually unscratchable’ screen, made from sapphire. At least, that’s the rumour being circulated by technology aficionados online. Why sapphire? Well, it’s the second hardest naturally occurring material on earth, after diamond. The iPhone 6 will not technically be the first sapphire crystal mobile on sale in Britain. But if, as expected, it goes on sale here for roughly £600, it’ll be the first that is vaguely affordable. The only sapphire-screened mobile phone currently available here is the Vertu Signature Touch, a super-deluxe model that costs a wallet-busting £6,750. The phone also includes a camera made by upmarket manufacturers Hasselblad and an audio system designed by Bang & Olufsen. The Apple model, on the other hand, will be firmly aimed at the mass market. Business experts are predicting the company is preparing to manufacture an incredible 75 million iPhone 6s by the end of this year. So how ‘unscratchable’ is sapphire? And is this the holy grail for phones? Theoretically, since the only substance harder than sapphire is diamond, the only thing that could damage a sapphire screen would be a diamond. But that would only be true if the screen were of pure naturally occurring sapphire, which it is not. It uses man-made sapphire, which is not quite as robust. Synthetic sapphires can be made in a lab and are almost identical in chemical structure to the real gem stone, only clearer and lighter. The respected technology expert Marques Brownlee managed to get hold of one of Apple’s new screens - albeit without a phone attached - and subjected it to a raft of assaults. In a YouTube video which has been viewed more than 1.5 million times, Brownlee slashes the screen with a sharp hunting knife and a set of house keys — and it emerges as good as new. ‘The worst blemish,’ he says studying it afterwards, ‘was my fingerprints.’ He concludes: ‘Basically, as long as you’re not carrying some high-quality sandpaper in your pocket, you should be good.’ Damaged screens are certainly a common problem. A recent survey of 2,500 iPhone users revealed that nearly a quarter of them were using phones with a screen that was chipped, scratched or cracked. Other smartphones are just as vulnerable. In an attempt to deal with the issue, some manufacturers have begun using a material called ‘gorilla glass’, which is more scratch-resistant than ordinary toughened glass. But ask anyone who has used both gorilla glass and sapphire and they’ll tell you: sapphire screens are in a different league. Michael Fisher, editorial director of tech website pocketnow.com, carried out his own tests on a phone with a sapphire screen, attacking it violently with steel wool, coins, a knife and sharp stones. None of them left a scratch. ‘Sapphire crystal is not a gimmick,’ he says. ‘It really can withstand a lot more abuse than any of the other current materials. I had to beat the hell out of it to get it to chip or scratch.’ He only eventually damaged the screen when he threw the phone from 3ft in the air on to sharp stones. ‘Scratch resistance is not the same as impact resistance,’ he says, pointing out that even water, if sprayed at a high enough pressure, can cut steel. Fisher believes that soon all mobile phones will have a super-tough screen, whether it’s Apple’s sapphire technology or a rival version. After all, pretty much every smartphone you can buy now manages your emails, has a decent camera and a high-resolution display. The strength of the screen is likely to be the next battleground. Risk: Everyday life poses a significant - and costly - threat to smartphone users . There are, however, two potential problems with sapphire. The first is size. Up until now, sapphire screens have been too thick for the manufacturers to want to use them. But Apple seems to have solved this problem — although they haven’t yet revealed how they have done it. The other issue is cost. It’s estimated that a traditional glass screen costs a manufacturer around £1.80 per phone; a sapphire screen is believed to cost around £18. By the time that extra cost has filtered down to the consumers on the High Street, you could be looking at a phone that’s £100 more expensive than a normal glass-fronted model. But, inevitably, that premium will eventually go down as the technology goes into mass production. Jason Jenkins, editor of the CNet technology website, says: ‘If Apple wanted, they could soak up the extra cost — their margins on iPhones are very high. But it would be strange for a company to choose to do that.’ Yet price is not everything. ‘I think the biggest problem with smartphones are not scratched screens but cracked ones,’ says Jenkins. ‘You drop it, it lands on its side and the screen cracks. So, if Apple has developed a way to make the glass more resistant to that, that’s going to be the biggest win.’ Jenkins adds: ’The hard part isn’t making one screen that doesn’t scratch or crack, it’s making hundreds of millions of them. The biggest challenge will be getting a good quality product when you’re producing lots of them - and at a cost that doesn’t make the phone unaffordable.’ That said, the cost of maintaining a phone with a non-sapphire screen can also be high. Currently, Apple charges £216 to put a new screen on a cracked iPhone 5S, though small mobile-phone shops often carry out unofficial repairs for around half that amount. But £100 is still a lot of money for fitting what is essentially a piece of glass. It’s no wonder that there are video ‘tutorials’ on YouTube for those who want to buy a new screen online and repair their phones at home. The steep cost of repairs is also why so many smartphone users choose to just buy a new phone instead of fixing their old one. And why so many of us stick our beautifully crafted pieces of engineering inside an ugly, plastic protective case. Many also attach a cheap ‘screen protector’ (a sheet of clear, adhesive plastic) on the front to help guard the phone from scratches. As Jason Jenkins says: ‘At the moment you’re a bit stuck: either you enjoy your beautiful phone and accept that after a couple of years it’s going to be scratched and you throw it away - or you wrap it up in a case and can’t enjoy the aesthetics that probably made you buy it in the first place.’ That is, however, before the arrival of sapphire. If sapphire screens live up to their promise, your mobile phone will be almost indestructible. Just make sure you keep it away from your diamond engagement ring.","Everyday scratches and cracks in screens can cost more than £200 to fix .

"Brain injury that occurs in the womb or early in a child's growth could be the root cause of autism according to new research. A paper published just last month by Dr. Samuel Wang, an associate professor of molecular biology and neuroscience at Princeton University, argues that damage to the cerebellum may contribute to autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and other neurodevelopmental disorders later in life. The cerebellum, Dr. Wang theorizes, is responsible for helping young minds process complex sensory information, which, over time, eventually leads them to form normal social relationships. Scroll down for video . New research: Damage in the brain while a child is in the womb may be the root cause of autism according to a paper published by Dr. Samuel Wang . It is widely believed that symptoms of the disorder become apparent before a child is three-years-old. The cerebellum only makes up about 10 percent of the brain’s mass, and is mostly in charge of movement-related functions, such as coordination. Early in a child's life, however, Dr. Wang makes the argument that the cerebellum has a much larger role, specifically as it pertains to social development. 'Some of the clinical and animal-research evidence for cerebellar involvement in autism has been known for years,' Dr. Wang says in an interview with The Daily Beast. 'But this evidence doesn't fit into the textbook wisdom that the cerebellum controls sensory processing and movement. At some level, researchers have been trapped by whatever framework they learned in college or graduate school.' The paper gives the example of a child's response to a parent's smile. There is no reward to a smile, so the smile itself does not do anything to stimulate the parts of the brain that respond to rewards. Over time however, the cerebellum begins to correlate seeing a parent smile with other rewards, such as being fed, and connects the areas of the brain that see the smile with those that signal rewards. Should, however, a child have had any damage to the cerebellum in their formative years, they would be unable to make this connection between that part of the brain that sees the smile and that which triggers rewards, which would likely impair their social development. Early damage to the cerebellum could also effect other 'downstream' areas of the brain, such as those responsible for cognition, which would most likely inhibit normal development. Findings: Children with a cerebellar injury at birth have a likelihood of getting an ASD that is akin to that of a smoker developing lung cancer . For a child known to have a cerebellar injury at birth, the paper reports an increased relative risk for an ASD as equivalent to that of a smoker developing lung cancer. And while Dr. Wang and his coauthors do not completely rule out injury during a child's early life as a possible root of this disorder, they feel it is more likely an injury suffered in the womb that is the cause. 'The research evidence is consistent with the idea that by birth, nearly all of the risk that leads to ASD has already occurred,' Dr. Wang says. 'There is certainly the possibility of postnatal risks, but to my knowledge the evidence for this is weak, and can usually be explained by some prenatal event.' Having identified what he believes to be the root, now Dr. Wang hopes to move on to the next stage, and find better ways to treat the disorder. 'In the case of autism, the early-life cerebellum might be a target for future intervention,' he concludes his paper, which was published in the journal Neuron. 'Autism researchers have been hacking away at the genetics for years, but genes are a far cry from brain circuits. There's such a gap between genes and child development. I hope our article can help bridge that gap.'","A new paper by Dr. Samuel Wang, a professor at Princeton, argues that damage to the cerebellum in the womb could be the root of autism .

"A mother has defended her choice to undergo a controversial fertility treatment that helped her get pregnant with her now-teenage daughter. Sharon Saarinen became pregnant via a process called cytoplasmic transfer, which involves injected a donor egg into the mother's egg to boost the egg's health. However, the treatment has now been banned in the U.S. and is currently under investigation for possible health risks to the child. 'I think it was the only thing that helped me. If there were risks, it didn't matter. I wanted a child too much at that point, Mrs Saarinen told The Independent. 'It was definitely the right thing to do.' Mrs Saarinen's daughter Alana is now a healthy teenager who is doing well in high school. 'The right thing to do': Alana Saarinen (right) was conceived through a controversial technique called cytoplasmic transfer. She sits at home with her mother Sharon, who says she does not regret the decision . But there are concerns that the treatment compromises the health of the child, many of which inherit DNA from three parents. The Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center in New Jersey is now investigating what - if any - are the ill effects of the now-halted fertility technique . Before it was banned, the technique helped up to 30 women conceive, about 17 of which came from Saint Barnabas. Why now? Around 17 babies were conceived at the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science at Saint Barnabas Medical Center using cytoplasmic transfer, a now banned technique. Now, well over a decade later, the clinic is reportedly looking into long-term effects on the children for the very first time . Only two of those children, both now in their teens, have been named. One of them Alana and the other is Emma Ott, a Pittsburgh girl who became the first ever child born after being conceived by the 3-parent technique when she arrived happy and healthy in 1997. Today, Emma is a healthy teenage girl in high school. According to the Independent, neither has been checked for long-term health issues that could be related to the technique. Hopeful: The new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria, the energy source in a cell, from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and mental retardation. About one in 200 children is born every year in Britain with a mitochondrial disorder. At the time Alana and Emma were conceived, scientists were using cytoplasmic transfer in the hopes it would increase the chances of successful conception in patients for whom traditional IVF had been unsuccessful. What it also did was transfer the donor's mitochondrial DNA--which is passed along only by mothers--into the fertilized egg. That left the egg carrying the DNA of three parents: donor, recipient and father. In Emma, researchers said there was no lasting trace of the donor's mitochondrial DNA. According to the Independent, Alana has not been tested. However, some of the some 30 three-parent babies conceived worldwide did retain a third DNA. Before the technique could become more widespread, the U.S. halted the use of the largely untested technique. A call made to the Institute for Reproductive Medicine and Science by MailOnline was not immediately returned. Reports of their investigation into children like Emma and Alana come just as Britain is considering legalizing more advanced and refined three-parent conception techniques. But instead of boosting fertility, scientists in Britain as well as the U.S. now want to transfer mitochondrial DNA as a means of preventing mitochondrial diseases from being passed on from mother to child. The new techniques help women with faulty mitochondria, the energy source in a cell, from passing on to their babies defects that can result in such diseases as muscular dystrophy, epilepsy, heart problems and mental retardation. About one in 200 children is born every year in Britain with a mitochondrial disorder. Ill effects? Babies born with the help of a New Jersey fertility clinic using a technique that put the genes of three parents into an egg are now teenagers . For a woman with faulty mitochondria, scientists take only the healthy genetic material from her egg or embryo. They then transfer that into a donor egg or embryo that still has its healthy mitochondria but has had the rest of its key DNA removed. The fertilized embryo is then transferred into the womb of the mother. Some groups oppose artificial reproduction techniques and believe the destruction of eggs or embryos to be immoral. British tabloids jumped on the procedure when it was first announced in 2008 and labeled it the creation of a three-parent baby — the mother, the donor and the father — a charge scientists claim is inaccurate because the amount of DNA from the donor egg is insignificant.","Sharon Saarinen conceived her daughter Alana using a controversial IVF treatment called cytoplasmic transfer .

"A tropical depression formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on Saturday after drenching Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, and could become a hurricane as it moves over the warm open waters near the Bahamas, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said. A tropical storm warning was issued for the Turks and Caicos islands and the southeast and central Bahamas as the weather system passed about 75 miles (120 km) northeast of Great Inagua island, with winds gusting over 35 miles an hour (55 km per hour). An Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunter aircraft 'found a well-defined circulation this afternoon', the NHC reported on Saturday. It could become a category one hurricane with 75 mph (120 kph) winds within three days, it added. Headed for the mainland: Tropical Depression Four has formed in the western Atlantic Ocean over the Turks and Caicos Islands (pictured) and is expected to develop into Hurricane Cristobal this week, potentially threatening the southeast coast of America (top left) Forecast models show the storm passing to the east of the Florida peninsula and continuing to curve north-eastward over the Atlantic during next week, staying off the U.S. coast. Heavy rain fell overnight and into Saturday in Puerto Rico and several towns were under a flash flood watch. 'We will be affected for the rest of the day and into tomorrow morning,' said National Weather Service meteorologist Tony Estrada. The heavy rains filled up Lake Carraizo and the La Plata River, two of the main water sources for the capital city, San Juan, eliminating the threat of water rationing after months of unseasonably dry weather. In the Dominican Republic an estimated 790 people were displaced after at least 158 homes were flooded, the National Center for Emergency Operations said on Saturday. Ominous: A man fishes as a cluster of storms passes through the area, in San Juan, Puerto Rico, on Friday, Aug. 22, 2014 . Rough: The National Weather Service in San Juan said the region could be hit with up to 6 inches (15 centimeters) of rain and wind gusts of 35 mph . Communication was severed with at least 10 communities by flooded roads and damaged bridges. Flash flood and mudslide warnings were in place in 17 of the country's 31 provinces. Federal forecasters in August downgraded their outlook for the 2014 Atlantic hurricane season, predicting below-normal activity with seven to 12 named storms, and no more than two expected to reach major hurricane status. A major hurricane is considered to be Category 3 or above with winds hitting at least 111 mph (178 kph).

A tropical depression formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on Saturday . So far this year two hurricanes – Arthur and Bertha – have developed in the Atlantic. Only Arthur, a Category 2 storm, made landfall, on North Carolina's Outer Banks in early July. A typical season has 12 named storms, with six hurricanes, and three becoming Category 3 storms. In its August outlook, the agency said cooler-than-average temperatures in the tropical Atlantic Ocean would make it difficult for larger storms to develop.","Tropical depression that soaked Puerto Rico and Dominican Republic formed over the Turks and Caicos Islands on Saturday .

"Hurricane Cristobal hurled heavy rains across Atlantic and Caribbean islands on Tuesday as it headed toward Bermuda, and officials said the storm had caused at least five deaths. The U.S. National Hurricane Center in Miami said the hurricane would likely avoid a collision with the U.S. Eastern Seaboard, but it was generating life-threatening surf and rip current conditions from central Florida to North Carolina. The storm had maximum sustained winds of 80 mph (130 kph), and it was expected to pass northwest of Bermuda on Wednesday, and strengthen slightly by Thursday. On Tuesday night, it was centered 435 miles (700 kilometers) west-southwest of Bermuda and was moving north at 16 mph (26 kph). Scroll down for video .

Hurricane force winds extended outward up to 60 miles (95 kilometers) from the center. Cristobal was expected to dump up to 4 inches (10 centimeters) of rain over Bermuda and lesser amounts over the already sodden Bahamas and the Turks and Caicos. Hotel owners and tourist operators in Bermuda were dismayed at the forecast, noting that August already has been one of the rainiest months in recent history for the British island territory. 'It's been a ridiculous, endless amount of rain,' said Marlie Powell, owner of the Kingston House Bed & Breakfast. 'It's the height of our tourist season, so it's not a happy thing.' Turks and Caicos officials said flights resumed Tuesday at the islands' international airport, which closed as the hurricane dumped some 12 inches (30 centimeters of rain) on the islands. The governor's office reported one death after recovering a body from floodwaters on the main island of Providenciales. 'The situation on North Caicos is extremely serious,' said Premier Rufus Ewing, who visited the island on Tuesday. 'The flood water in some areas is perhaps 1,000 feet (309 meters) across and up to 5 feet (1.5 meters) deep in places.'

Government offices on North Caicos remained closed. In addition to the person who died in Turks and Caicos, floodwaters killed two men in the Dominican Republic and two people in Haiti, where roughly 640 families were left temporarily homeless. Meanwhile in the Pacific, Hurricane Marie was weakening off Mexico's Pacific coast, though it was generating large, dangerous swells that were nearing the beaches of Southern California. On the rise: Tropical Storm Cristobal is expected to strengthen over the coming days, officials say . The hurricane's sustained winds had decreased to near 100 mph (155 kph) from a peak of 160 mph (260 kph) on Sunday. It was expected to slump to tropical storm force on Wednesday.

"Sudden: Lisa Mason passed away while she was studying to be a nurse after taking out a $100,000 student loan . A Californian pastor is being mercilessly hounded for $200,000 in student loans he was saddled with when his 27-year-old daughter Lisa died suddenly of liver failure. Crippled by the $2,000 a month in repayments and unable legally to declare bankruptcy to rid himself of the huge debt, Steve Mason, 59, and his wife Darnelle have reached their wits end. Each time they have appealed to the lenders to beg for help, the couple have been told that the only solution is to repay the mammoth loans - some of which have interest rates of 12 percent - in full. Making the situation dramatically worse is the fact that the couple are now the guardians of daughter Lisa's three children, ages nine, 12 and 14, leaving their futures in the balance. Before her death, Lisa Mason had taken out $100,000 in private student loans to fund her education at nursing school and crucially, Steve had co-signed on them. In the five years since her tragic passing, Steve and Darnelle's inability to keep up with the payments has seen the sum owed double to $200,000 because of the high interest rates and late-fee penalties. Compounding the desperation, Steve makes less than $75,000 a year at Oasis Church in Redlands, California and Darnelle earns less in her role as director at the same church. Guardians: Steve Mason and wife Darnelle with their grandchildren, ages, nine, 12 and 14 - who they are caring for . 'It's just impossible on a pastor's salary raising three kids to pay $2,000 a month on loans,' said Mason to CNN Money, claiming that he is now searching for a second job. The answer to why Steve is in such dire financial straits is because these are private student loans. Had they been federal student loans, then Steve could have appealed to have them wiped or at the very least received a sensible and manageable payment plan. However, because these are private loans he has nowhere to turn legally. Private lenders are not bound by federal regulations to provide assistance to those in financial difficulty, according to CNN Money, not even when a family member has passed away. To 'forgive' a loan is purely down to the lending firm and Steve told CNN Money that he has called each of the lenders who provided his daughter money and asked for help and they have said that while they understand, they are not legally required to help. Even worse, student loans are the only type of debt that cannot be discharged by declaring bankruptcy. 'People with other debt from splurging -- they can discharge that,' he said to CNN Money. 'Student loans should really be the one type of debt they do discharge because it's done to further an education and career. But somehow getting my daughter an education has encumbered me for the rest of my life.' Mom and daughter: Lisa Mason with her mother, Darnelle, before her tragic and sudden death from liver failure in 2009 . One of the lenders, Navient Crop, did reduce Steve's interest rate to 0% on three of four loans and lowered the amount owed from $35,000 to $27,000. 'We extend our deepest sympathies to the Mason family on the loss of their daughter,' the company said in a statement to CNN Money. 'We're reaching out to Mr. Mason to offer further assistance as appropriate.' Another of the lenders, American Education Services (AES), who provided the bulk of the loan to Lisa, said that it is merely recouping its money and doesn't make the law on loan forgiveness. Steve was told by AES that he would need to speak to the original lender, National Collegiate Trust. The pastor did and was told that he had to repay the loans. Steve has shelved his plans for retirement and because he is bringing up his daughter's children will be looking after them till his 70th birthday, minimum. He has not taken a vacation with his wife since Lisa's death and feels financially trapped. 'We've pretty much gone through our retirement [funds] already -- we didn't have a lot saved to begin with and now any extra money goes to the kids, as it should, and then whatever we can pay on the loans, we do,' said Mason to CNN Money. 'At my stage of life, I should have a very different lifestyle than I do.'","California pastor Steve Mason and his wife Darnelle are facing financial ruin .

"As one of the world's most dangerous cities, life in  Medellin can be pretty tough. But despite the bleak poverty and constant threat from criminal gangs, there is one ray of sunlight for the city's inhabitants. Based in one of the poorest districts of Colombia's second largest city, the enormous  384 metre (1,260ft) long escalator has made the lives of its residents a whole lot easier.

For generations 12,000 people living in Medellin's tough Comuna 13 - which clings to a hillside - have had to made the arduous journey up hundreds of large steps, the equivalent to climbing up a 28-storey building. But now this giant outdoor escalator has cut their journey from 35-minutes to just six. The escalator was completed in 2011 but it was only recently that a cover was put over it - meaning that, no matter what the weather, the city's residents are completely covered. The escalator is divided into six sections so people living on all parts of the hillside have easy access to it.

"It is 'very unlikely' that a man being tested for Ebola at New York City’s Mount Sinai Hospital has the deadly virus, it was reported on Monday night. Mount Sinai’s Chief Medical Officer Jeremy Boal said: 'It’s much more likely that it’s a much more common condition, and we’re ruling those things out as well.' The full test results are expected to be released today or Wednesday. The patient arrived at the hospital’s emergency room early on Monday morning with ‘a high fever and gastrointestinal symptoms,’ according to a hospital statement. Scroll down for video . New York City's Mount Sinai Hospital is treating a sick male patient who recently returned from a West African country where the Ebola virus has been reported. Doctors late on Monday said it is 'very unlikely' he has the disease . He had recently returned from a West African country where the Ebola virus has been reported. The patient has been isolated and is undergoing diagnostic testing for Ebola but also for other illnesses that could cause his symptoms. ‘All necessary steps are being taken to ensure the safety of all patients, visitors and staff,’ the hospital said. ‘We will continue to work closely with federal, state and city health officials to address and monitor this case, keep the community informed and provide the best quality care to all of our patients.’ The Department of Health also released a statement stating that the patient is unlikely to have the deadly disease. 'After consultation with CDC and Mount Sinai, the Health Department has concluded that the patient is unlikely to have Ebola. Specimens are being tested for common causes of illness and to definitively exclude Ebola,' read the statement. Another patient was isolated at a hospital in the city last week after arriving on a flight from West Africa and showing symptoms found in Ebola patients. Over the weekend, Dr Kent Brantly - an American physician infected with Ebola - was brought to the United States from Africa. He is being treated in Atlanta . That man . was screened at Kennedy International Airport on Wednesday night and . taken to Bellevue Hospital. He had a fever, but within a day the fever . had gone away and it became clear that he did not have Ebola, reports . the New York Times. 'We are on a heightened state of alert,' said Ian Michaels, a spokesman for the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation. 'We have instructed all 11 of our hospitals to follow C.D.C. guidelines and be on the lookout for Ebola-like symptoms.' Meanwhile Nancy Writebol, the American aid worker with Ebola, landed in Maine early this morning for her plane to refuel before being moved to the Atlanta hospital where she will be treated. Over the weekend, Dr Kent Brantly - an American doctor infected with Ebola - was brought to the U.S. from Africa. He is being treated in Atlanta. Federal agents at U.S. airports are watching travelers from Africa for flu-like symptoms that could be tied to the recent Ebola outbreak, as delegations from some 50 countries arrive in the nation's capital for a leadership summit this week. Border patrol agents at Washington's . Dulles International and New York's JFK airports in particular have been . told to ask travelers about possible exposure to the virus and to be on . the lookout for anyone with a fever, headache, achiness, sore throat, . diarrhea, vomiting, stomach pain, rash or red eyes. Devoted: Nancy Writebol, 59, is a devoted missionary who knowingly risked her safety to help battle the Ebola virus outbreak . Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland, . which will receive several African heads of state, is screening . passengers too, while U.S. Secret Service agents in charge of security . for the three-day summit have been briefed on what to look for and how . to respond, officials said on Monday. If a passenger is suspected of carrying the deadly virus, they would be quarantined immediately and evaluated by medical personnel, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which provided the additional training to local airports. 'There is always the possibility that someone with an infectious disease can enter the United States,' CDC spokeswoman Barbara Reynolds said on Monday. 'The public health concern is whether it would spread, and, if so, how quickly.' The Ebola virus causes a hemorrhagic fever that has stricken more than 1,600 people, killing at least 887 of them in Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone and Nigeria. The virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, such as blood or urine, unlike an airborne virus like influenza or the common cold. A person exposed to the virus can take . up to 21 days to exhibit any symptoms, making it possible for infected . travelers to enter the U.S. without knowing they have it. A Nigerian health official displays a leaflet explaining Ebola in the arrival hall of Murtala Muhammed International Airport in Lagos . This maps hows the various quarantine stations located across the U.S. While the CDC says it is not screening passengers boarding planes at African airports - the job of local authorities there - the center said it has encouraged vulnerable countries to follow certain precautions. Outbound passengers in the countries experiencing Ebola are being screened for fevers and with health questionnaires, Reynolds said. Health officials say the threat to Americans remains relatively small, even with the uptick in travel this week between Africa and the United States. In the past decade, five people have entered the U.S. known to have a viral hemorrhagic fever, including a case last March of a Minnesota man diagnosed with Lassa Fever after traveling to West Africa. Reynolds said in all five instances, U.S. officials were able to contain the illness. A vaccine against Ebola has been successfully tested with monkeys, and there is hope it could become available as early as next July, Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institutes of Health told CBS This Morning on Monday.","The man was admitted to hospital with high fever after recently returning from a West African country where the deadly virus has been reported .

"When the largest shopping centre in the world opened in 2005, it was dubbed the Great Mall of China, and around 70,000 shoppers were expected to flock there each day. The South China Mall seemed to have it all: an 82ft Arc de Triomphe, a 1.3-mile canal complete with gondolas, and an enormous indoor and outdoor roller-coaster. There was only one thing missing: the shops. Scroll down for video . Going nowhere: Escalators are draped in sheets . A monument to failure: The mall in Dongguan has never got off the ground . They were missing when the mall in the Chinese city of Dongguan opened in 2005, when fewer than 99 per cent of the stores were leased, and they are still missing now. Occupancy rate at the 7m square feet mall - the largest in the world in terms of leasable space and more than twice as big as the largest mall in the US, the Mall of America - is still lying at one per cent. Those who hoped the South China Mall would herald a new dawn in which China would consume what it produced, rather than simply export it, have seen their hopes dashed. The mall was dreamt up - and paid for - by Alex Hu Guirong, a Dongguan native who became a billionaire selling instant noodles. It was designed around seven zones, each representing a city, country or area: Amsterdam, Venice, Paris, Rome, Egypt, California, and the Caribbean. Designers were sent around the world for two years scouting for good locations for zones, and car park spaces were built for all the shoppers who would drive there. Covered in dust: Decorations put up years ago still hang from the ceiling . Empty as the day it opened: There's only litter in the shopping centre's corridors . But the project never took off, and eight years on, it is still lying fallow.  (Meanwhile the largest shopping centre in the world by total area, the Dubai Mall, is now the world's most visited shopping and leisure destination with more than 54m visitors a year.) In the Chinese mall, sheets lie draped over unmoving escalators, old decorations still hang, covered in dust, and the only movement is the odd crisp packet blown by the wind along an empty corridor. Instead of shop assistants, the few people employed in the echoing centre are security guards paid to sit on chairs and keep vandals out. How it should have looked: A map of the shopping centre at the beginning . Impressive entrance: The 82ft Arc de Triomphe outside the empty mall . No shops, no shoppers: One corridor after another lies empty . A handful of businesses still operate, mostly fast-food restaurants to serve the families who bring their children to the amusement park and IMAX cinema outside the mall. But the vast majority of the mall, including what should have been a gleaming hotel for all the destination shoppers, remains empty. Chinese retail experts say one of the problems is the lack of transport infrastructure to bring the shoppers in. Shrouded in sheets: The empty mall is home to security guards . Barren wasteland: Outside the shopping mall the ground is untended . Busier outside: Families visit the amusement park and IMAX cinema outside the shopping centre . Now known as the 'New' South China Mall (the 'New' was added in a failed relaunch in 2007), it doesn't lie on any major transport network or nearby airport, and can take hours to get to via public transport, even for those living a short distance away. A reporter who wrote this detailed account of the mall for Vagabondjourney.com said it took him more than two-and-a-half hours to get to the mall by bus from six miles away. But even if the locals could get there, they might not want to. Dongguan has a population of more than 10m, but with most of the inhabitants working in the city's factories, they do not have deep enough pockets to do justice to a a high-end shopping centre. China has also been badly hit by the global recession, with its export market suffering from the financial woes of the United States and Europe. The mall is now owned by the Founders Group, a division of Beijing University, but any plans they have for its future remain to be seen.

"An Indiana paramedic has been reunited with his son who, along with his siblings, was abducted by his mother 18 years ago. Nathan Slinkard was kidnapped by his mom, Trena Slinkard, in October 1995, after Steven Slinkard, the children's father, was given full custody in their divorce. She fled with the then-5-year-old, his brother, Andrew, 7, and his 3-year-old sister, Sydney, to Mexico and had not been heard from since. But last week, Nathan, now aged 23, walked into the . United States Consulate in Guadalajara, Mexico, and asked to return home . to his father, who hadn't seen his son for nearly two decades. Authorities say Trena failed to return the children to their father in Greenfield, . about 20 miles east of Indianapolis, despite a court order giving Steven full custody of all three kids. Happier times: The Slinkard family (from top, left to right) Steven; his wife, Trena; and their children, Andrew, Sydney and Nathan in January 1995 - just months before little Nathan's abduction . Snatched: Nathan Slinkard, shown left in a photo from 1995 and right in a digital image from the FBI, was taken to Mexico by his mother in violation of a court order giving full custody of the children to their father . It wasn't immediately clear when the . children were taken out of the U.S., or under what . circumstances Nathan and the others separated. Investigators . had tried to track the family for years, said Hancock County Sheriff's Department Lt. Ted Munden, the last local investigator in the case. He said officers . regularly pursued tips about possible sightings, but they always proved . false. However, out of . the blue, Nathan chose to come forward last week, requesting to return . to the U.S. To prove his identity, the 23-year-old showed his Social . Security card, birth certificate and his scars that matched his medical . records. Steven said it took just seconds for him to recognize his son, despite the years that have passed. The veteran . EMS worker and deputy coroner had received a photo of Nathan a few days before he arrived at . Indianapolis International Airport from Mexico. But he said he was caught off guard at first by . Nathan's full head of dark hair, because he was blonde as a child. Missing siblings: Nathan, pictured far left in an age progression image, was the only one to return to the U.S. for now. His brother Andrew (center) and sister Sydney (right) still live somewhere in Mexico . New chapter: Nathan walked into the United States Consulate in Guadalajara, Mexico, showed his Social Security card and asked to return home to his father . 'It took about 5 seconds. I was like, ah, yeah, I remember that little face,' he told the Daily Reporter. Munden was present during the first meeting between the father, son and his aunt. He said Slinkard was nervous, and even asked him on the way to the airport if he should shake Nathan's hand, or give him a hug. 'Nathan . immediately recognized us at the airport. He walked up and initiated a . hug to his father,' Munden said. 'It was neat. It was really neat.' Steven said he found comfort in the fact his youngest son was carrying . a photo of them together before the 1995 disappearance. 'I thought that they were probably kept away from my pictures, but it doesn't sound like it,' Steven said. He said he is being patient through their reunion. 'We've got quite a few years to go through,' Steven Slinkard said. 'I'm just glad he's home.' Munden told CNN Nathan is currently staying with his father and has very big plans for the future. 'He's staying with Dad right now,' Munden said. 'He's a good kid, lots of ambitions.' Wanted: There is still a state warrant for Trena Slinkard's arrest in the custody case . Nathan, who is fluent in English and Spanish, wants to attend college in the U.S. and become a cardiologist, a physical . therapist or a nurse. Authorities say Nathan has assured them that his brother and sister are alive and healthy and . know they are free to return to the U.S. 'They're just not ready to do that yet,' Munden said, refusing to disclose where his siblings, and their mother, are currently residing. Should his daughter and other son decide to return, Steven is waiting with open arms. 'That would be great to see everybody, and I hope to someday,' he said. 'I love them, and I miss them, and I hope that they know I never gave up.' Authorities still have a state warrant for Trena Slinkard's arrest in the custody case but Munden said they 'would be more than happy to drop that warrant if they wanted to come back.' But he said he investigators would insist she have 'one sit down with Steve and the three children.'","Nathan Slinkard was 5 years old when his mother took him, his brother and sister to Mexico in violation of court order .

But human rights activists have called for an end to dangerous cultural traditions after 42 boys died from botched circumcisions in just three weeks last year, reported The Guardian. This figure was almost double the total of 26 reported over the same period in 2011. Then, five boys were so badly injured that their genitals had to be amputated - and 300 were taken to hospital. Non-governmental group the Sonke Gender Justice Network last year called for intervention, with a spokesman saying: ‘Why do we allow certain cultural practices to rob young people of their future?’ Traditional: A Xhosa boy covered with a blanket and smeared with chalky mud stands in a field as he and others undergo a Xhosa male circumcision ceremony .

"Officials in Japan have opened Fukushima state's first beach to swimmers since last year's nuclear disaster after judging the water to be safe. About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, where three reactors melted down after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami. The opening was celebrated with beach volleyball games and hula dancers from a nearby spa. A family plays on Nakoso Beach in Iwaki in Japan's Fukushima state. The beach is the first to be opened to the public since the nearby nuclear power station meltdown following the earthquake and tsunami of March 2011 . Playtime: About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant . Iwaki city official Joji Kimura said negligible radiation was detected in water at the beach. Airborne radiation was measured at 0.08 microsieverts an hour, far below dangerous levels. Swimming had been banned at all beaches in the state since the disaster last March. The opening took place on the same . day that the Japanese government came under fire over its handling of . public hearings on nuclear energy policy. The criticism threatens to dent already sagging support for the ruling party ahead of an election many expect to be this year. The latest furore follows Monday's massive rally in Tokyo against nuclear power in the wake of the Fukushima disaster. Local officials and analysts say the . issue is now so contentious that it could trump taxes as the focus of . lower house elections, which must be held by September 2013 but could . come sooner. News that power company employees . were among the few chosen to speak at hearings on changes to energy . policy after Fukushima, the world's worst atomic disaster in 25 years, have been greeted with widespread scepticism. On duty: Three local women working as tour guides enter the water in front of a gaggle of photographers and cameramen . Mass demonstrations: Anti-nuclear energy protesters march through Tokyo on Monday . Fun times: An anti-nuclear protester dressed as a clown is watched by police officers . Koichi Nakano, a professor at Sophia University, said: 'This gives the impression that they haven't learned anything.' It echoes a scandal just one year . ago, when Kyushu Electric Power sought to sway public opinion at a . hearing on restarting reactors in southern Japan. In a sign of the growing discontent, . more than 100,000 anti-nuclear protesters marched in Tokyo on Monday, . adding to pressure on Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda, already struggling . as his Democratic Party unravels over plans to hike the sales tax to . curb public debt. Mr Nakano said: 'The anti-nuclear people are calling for the Democrats to be voted out.' The rally was the biggest since Noda . said last month that Japan needs to restart idled nuclear reactors to . protect jobs and the economy. Damning: The nuclear accident at Fukushima last year was a 'man-made disaster' and not completely because of the tsunami, a report said earlier this month . Reactor meltdown: The damning indictment was delivered by the Japanese parliamentary panel . Disaster: Smoke is pictured ascending from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant's Unit 3 in Okumamachi in Fukushima Prefecture on March 14 last year . The government is considering three . options for its medium-term energy portfolio - reduce nuclear power's . role to zero as soon as possible, aim at a 15 per cent share by 2030, . and seek a 20 to 25 per cent share by the same date. The new energy mix, to be decided in . August, will replace a scrapped 2010 programme that had sought to raise . nuclear power's share to more than half of electricity needs by 2030 . from about 30 per cent before the March 2011 disaster. The Fukushima disaster forced some . 150,000 people to flee their homes, many never to return. Some committed . suicide after seeing their homes and livelihoods destroyed. Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said the government would be looking at how to improve the hearings.","About 1,000 people yesterday descended on Nakoso beach, about 40miles south of the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, where three reactors melted down after the March 11, 2011 earthquake and tsunami ."
"If you are looking to combine an exotic city break with sun and sea, Mumbai is an ideal destination. India’s largest, most prosperous city is a place where you will find everything, from heritage buildings, vast skyscrapers, fashionable apartment blocks, and gourmet restaurants to temples, green parks and street markets. Mumbai is also home to the Bollywood film industry. It has a vibrant nightlife and a great choice of luxury hotels – not least the famous Taj Mahal Palace. A stalwart of India old and new: The Taj Mahal Palace is the landmark hotel of vibrant Mumbai . A firm fixture: The Taj Mahal Palace opened in 1903 - and clings to an old-world charm around its courtyard pool . Coming into focus: The hotel - which is the subject of a new BBC drama that starts tonight - occupies a lovely location on the edge of the Arabian Sea (left); Right - the reception area revels in a certain opulence of style . This grand accommodation dame is the subject of a new four-part documentary series, Hotel India – which starts tonight (27 August) on BBC2. The Taj Mahal Palace is one of Mumbai’s oldest and most beautiful hotels, located towards the southernmost point of the city in the Colaba district (0091 22 5665 0300; www.tajhotels.com). An undoubted icon, it is a favourite with celebrities. Famous guests have included Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, Russell Brand and Jemima Khan, Tom Cruise, Sharon Stone, Mick Jagger, Sting, Michelle and Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. It is also where Ravi Shankar taught George Harrison to play the sitar. The hotel is a heady mix of architectural styles – Maharajah, Victorian Gothic and Florentine. On the edge of the Arabian Sea: Mumbai is a city defined by water . Speeding by: Although Mumbai is a city of enormous size, it can be toured - easily and cheaply - by taxi . There are 560 rooms, including 46 suites. These are located in two separate structures – the restored heritage Palace wing, and the newer Tower wing. The most luxurious suites, including the Presidential Suite, are housed in the former. But you don’t have to be an overnight guest to enjoy the all-encompassing opulence. Facilities include eleven restaurants, two bars and two lounges – such as the Harbour Bar, the Starboard pool restaurant and Japanese restaurant Wasabi. Or, if you want to sit and have a drink – or afternoon tea – while watching the waves of the Arabian Sea lapping at the shoreline, you can try the Sea Lounge on the first floor. Outside, Colaba is a busy shopping area full of stalls, shops and markets – selling jewellery, clothes, handicrafts and silks. Mumbai’s two famous markets, Crawford Market and Chor Bazaar (Thieves Market), are also down the road. Guests at the Taj Mahal Palace have included Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie, and Jemima Khan and Russell Brand . A wink and a nod: The Wink Bar, at Vivanta by Taj President Hotel, is a great spot for a decadent cocktail . At times, Mumbai can feel overwhelming. It takes at least two hours by train to travel from the south to north. But taxis are cheap – and you can hire a driver for half day or longer (for about 1000 Indian rupees/£10). Where you choose to stay can depend on whether you prefer the hustle and bustle of south Mumbai, or the calmer, residential suburbs in the north. The south is the business area, and the core of the metropolis. It is also where you will see some of Mumbai’s great landmarks, including the incredible Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus – the main railway station, built under British rule in the 1870s, and a UNESCO world heritage site. This was used as a backdrop for the final dance scene in Slumdog Millionaire. If you want a luxury base at affordable rates, the Vivanta by Taj President Hotel (0091 22 6665 0808; www.vivantabytaj.com) is another option. This is one of south Mumbai’s most happening hotels, with a stylish, laid-back vibe. A city of noise and people: The southern districts of Mumbai can be incredibly busy - but have bags of character . In a rush: Street food for the time-pressed diner is endlessly available in Mumbai . It does great deals, depending on when you book (from around £60 per person, based on two people sharing). Its Jiva spa can also be inexpensive – prices for beauty treatments starting at around £20; Ayurvedic massages and facials from £40. This lovely retreat is only a short taxi drive from Colaba, and a few minutes’ walk from the coastal avenue of Marine Drive – which runs from Nariman Point to Malabar Hills. This well-known promenade flows parallel to Chowpatty Beach, the only beach in the heart of the city, where locals go jogging in the mornings and meet up after work to socialise and watch the sunset. Marine Drive also has many shops where you can buy quality fabrics and silks. The hotel’s Wink Bar is a popular hot spot with the city’s fashionable crowd. This is a great place to chill out. The bar features guest DJs, and a choice of vodkas, wines and cocktails – including the Winktini signature cocktail. The hotel’s Konkan Café deals in dishes such as mango prawn curry and Malabari chicken masala. Out on a limb: The Taj Lands End Hotel sits on its own little peninsula in the Bandra area of the city . Come on in and relax: The Taj Lands End Hotel offers upmarket Italian cuisine at Maritime by San Lorenzo (left), and a little haven of peace at its outdoor pool (right), which benefits from breezes gusting in off the Arabian Sea . Must-see sights in this part of Mumbai include the National Gallery of Modern Art, the Hanging Gardens, Kamala Nehru Park and Dhobi Ghat. The latter is Mumbai’s famous open-air laundry, where clothes are washed in huge vats and left to dry in the sun. If you feel like wandering, head for Bandra, Mumbai’s ultra-hip suburb, located on the west side of the metropolis – and stay at the Taj Lands End Hotel (0091 22 699 4488; www.tajhotels.com). Leafy Bandra has a buzzy feel, with beautiful churches, cafes, restaurants and quirky little shops and boutiques. It is also home to many Bollywood stars, including Salman Khan, Shahrukh Khan and Kareena Kapoor.  Those fascinated by the gleam and glimmer of Mumbai’s movie industry can take a guided tour which shows off key locations (see www.bollywoodtourism.com). As its name suggests, the Taj Land’s End sits on a little peninsula, overlooking the Arabian Sea. It has 493 rooms, including 33 suites – and five restaurants, including Masala Bay and the Italian sophistication of Maritime by San Lorenzo. For a session of celebrity spotting, head to the Atrium Lounge – a favourite with the Bollywood film crowd where Shahrukh Khan is a regular. Mumbai is a busy, frenetic and intoxicating city. But wherever you are, you should always be able to find a retreat where you can enjoy calm amid the storm. Virgin Atlantic flies daily from Heathrow to Mumbai (0844 209 7310; www.virgin-atlantic.com). Greaves Travel (020 7487 9111; www.greavesindia.co.uk) offers tailor-made breaks to Mumbai from £1350 per person (based on two people travelling) - including return flights with Virgin Atlantic, four nights at the Vivanta by Taj President Hotel and Taj Lands End on a bed-and-breakfast basis (two nights at each hotel), transfers and a Bollywood tour.","The Taj Mahal Palace is the star of new BBC2 documentary, Hotel India .

"BBC Sport’s desire to use commentators across TV and radio led to Alan Green’s highly surprising Match of the Day debut at West Bromwich on Saturday. The 62-year-old Green has long been annoyed about MotD showing no interest in using him while other ‘inferior’ BBC radio voices have been given their opportunities. Green vented his upset in his autobiography in 2000, calling the BBC behaviour towards him ‘infantile’, adding: ‘There’s no point in false modesty. I know that I’m a good commentator. I don’t believe there is a good reason why I couldn’t make the move to television. Nor do I believe there’s any good reason why I shouldn’t have made that move, particularly since I’ve seen rather ordinary broadcasters move across. They know who they are and you should too. Alan Green in the commentary box with Graham Taylor, Green said he knows he's a good commentator . Alan Green commentated on the West Brom game on MOTD despite criticising the BBC in his autobiography . ‘Television is clearly happy to do without me. The feeling is mutual.’ But 14 years on the Beeb management say ‘the past is the past’ and intend to give Green further games on Match of the Day despite the mixed reaction on Twitter to his first commentary, a 2-0 win for Everton at The Hawthorns. Green has also been doing reports for BBC’s Final Score. A BBC spokesperson said: ‘We have a wealth of top-class commentators available to us across both TV and radio. MotD commentators have been used on 5 Live regularly in recent years while Alan Green and others have featured in our TV football programming and will continue to do so.’ Kevin Pietersen could be in trouble if his autobiography conflicts with his confidentiality contract with the ECB . The battle between the ECB and Kevin Pietersen over the outcast cricketer’s upcoming autobiography has begun after his agents Mission announced the book publicity tour. This starts at the Monastery in Manchester on October 7 — two days before publication — when a copy of the book is included in the £22 ticket price for ‘An evening with Kevin Pietersen’. The schedule alerted the ECB, who have not been shown the book and it is understood they have sent letters to Little, Brown reminding them of Pietersen’s confidentiality contract and asking to see the book in advance of it going on sale. Maddie Mogford, legal director of Little, Brown, declined to comment. Supermarket tycoon Colin Graves bankrolls county cricket champions Yorkshire . Supermarket tycoon Colin Graves, who bankrolls county champions Yorkshire, is responsible for another sporting sponsorship that brought great results. Graves backed Andy Murray at the start of his career, with the Cost-cutter funding ensuring 2013 Wimbledon champion Murray could go to the Sanchez-Casal tennis academy in Barcelona. The FA’s delegation in Geneva for Friday’s UEFA decision on the venues for Euro 2020 has unlikely past and present Ministers of Sport in the party. Helen Grant is representing the Government while London Mayor Boris Johnson is sending his commissioner for sport Kate Hoey, who was minister during the Blair Government. Hoey is far more steeped in football. But on the day she was appointed in 1999, Manchester United pulled out of the FA Cup to play in the World Club Championship and obnoxious control freak Alastair Campbell, Tony Blair’s communications chief, ordered her not to say anything about United’s controversial move. Wembley is the overwhelming favourite ahead of Munich to stage the Euro 2020 final. Graves, who founded Costcutter, also backed tennis star Andy Murray during the early years of his career . Sky Sports made a big noise about their extensive 3D coverage at the 2010 and 2012 Ryder Cups. But the doomed format appears to have been kicked into the long grass with a substantial multi-million pound loss. There are no Premier League matches yet scheduled to be shown in 3D this season while Sky have moved on to testing 4K — ultra high definition — at next week’s Ryder Cup at Gleneagles. FA chairman Greg Dyke’s reform of work permit regulations for footballers from non-EU countries proposes the scrapping of appeals, reducing permitted countries to those ranked in FIFA’s top 50 and stopping loan deals involving permit players. Surely Premier League chief executive Richard Scudamore, often the FA’s biggest obstacle, cannot object to these measures.

"The FA of Wales will quote a catalogue of mitigating circumstances after being charged by UEFA over a pitch invasion following Gareth Bale’s winning goal against Andorra. They will point to the frustrations of the Euro 2016 qualifying match being staged on a substandard artificial 3G pitch, described by Bale as the ‘worst I have ever played on’. There had been no warm-up events at Andorra’s new Estadio Nacional, the pitch only passed a late inspection and very inexperienced stewards — many in flip-flops and shorts — had not been properly briefed about crowd control. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Ryan Giggs: I hope for a new class of '92 . Real Madrid asked Gareth bale not to play the full match against Andorra due to the poor quality pitch . Wales will also complain the pitch was only watered at half-time in the half Andorra were attacking, with the hosts claiming the irrigation system hadn’t worked on the remainder of the playing surface. Meanwhile, Wales couldn’t adhere to a gentlemen’s agreement with Real Madrid to ensure Bale did not played the whole game. The Spaniards were understandably concerned about the world’s most expensive player turning out on such a poor pitch. Wales insiders claim the understanding with Madrid was that Bale would be taken off once victory was assured. But they needed him for 90 minutes after Andorra took the lead with their first competitive goal in four years and Bale’s winner didn’t come until the 81st minute. Darren Eales, Tottenham’s executive director, is to become president of MLS newcomers Atlanta. Eales follows his Spurs predecessor Paul Barber, who left to run Vancouver Whitecaps before returning as CEO at Brighton. Eales is on the FA’s pointless International Committee, which never meets, and won’t be able to do ambassador duties from the USA. Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and the Neville brothers' hotel is causing controversy already . The 133-room Hotel Football next to Old Trafford, in which Ryan Giggs, Paul Scholes, Nicky Butt and Phil and Gary Neville are investors, has upset fans even before it opens in December. They are moaning that the hotel, which is already fully booked for all home games this season, has a minimum two-night stay policy when there is high demand. But the ‘Class of 92’ say the hotel is adopting the same business practice as their Manchester competitors and the biggest challenge will be attracting customers when United aren’t playing. Arsenal’s Theo Walcott, bidding for a set of sports paintings at a Willow Foundation charity auction, promised to donate £26,000 for nothing, provided his bid rival paid £25,000 for the paintings — which he did. Arsenal forward Theo Walcott donated £26,000 to the Willow Foundation at a charity auction night . England outcast Kevin Pietersen will not just be limiting himself to hitting back at his many detractors in his autobiography, to be published on October 9. KP is also going on a book publicity tour that starts at The Monastery in Manchester on October 7 and includes literary festivals in Cheltenham, Bath and Guildford plus a date at the Institute of Education in London, giving him plenty of opportunities to launch into Andrew Strauss, Alastair Cook, Andy Flower and Matt Prior to name but four. The hand-picked hosts of the ‘Evenings with Kevin Pietersen’ are sure to be sympathetic to the author, as in Cheltenham where the questions will be asked by top sports journalist David Walsh, who was KP’s ghostwriter. Surrey have not selected KP for their last two Championship games and will need to be convinced he still has an appetite for cricket before offering him another contract. Kevin Pietersen will go on a tour to talk about his autobiography which will be published next month . Saturday morning football is the latest battleground in the Sky v BT war. Soccer AM is seen as a target which BT’s Fletch and Sav programme can outperform. BT claim they had done so after the first Saturday, adding that Sky overlord Barney Francis went into his Isleworth HQ to monitor the ailing Soccer AM output. Sky counter that Francis always views the first Premier League weekend from his office and that BT massaged their figures, which have more than halved since, by taking their peak when viewers were just switching on to watch Manchester United.","Real Madrid asked Wales not to let Gareth Bale play whole Andorra match .

"Ahead of the second semi-final, MARTIN KEOWN runs the rule over Argentina and Holland as both nations bid to face Germany in the World Cup final. They have been two of the stand-out players at the tournament and Lionel Messi and Arjen Robben go head to head. Whichever team stops the other’s star man will go a long way to reaching the final. With three central defenders, the temptation for Holland is to send one after Messi, but these days he is doing much more of his work in a deeper position. VIDEO Scroll down for Holland train under watchful eye of Van Gaal ahead of semi final . Shining light: Lionel Messi has been one of the players of the World Cup, helping Argentina to the last four . D(r)iving force: Arjen Robben has been magnificent for Holland . That responsibility has to be passed to . the midfielders and they have to close him down quickly. You rarely see . man-marking these days but if any manager is going to try something . different, it’s Louis van Gaal. The structure of the Dutch team seems better than Argentina’s and they work the ball more patiently. Then when it reaches the front three the pace quickens. Robben is ruthless when he isolates defenders and as effective as Messi one-on-one. Defenders can’t afford to dive in against him because if a foot is offered, Robben will go over it. Messi has dragged this Argentina team through but he performs much better when his fellow strikers are firing. Gonzalo Higuain finally came to the party with that fine finish against Belgium and Messi always looks better with a partner in crime. He has a big role to play, though I’m sure Alejandro Sabella would like to be able to have Sergio Aguero back in his side soon. In-form: Gonzalo Higuain is getting among the goals at exactly the right time . Kick-off: 9pm, Arena Corinthians, Sao Paulo. TV & Radio: LIVE IT V 1 from 8.30pm; BBC Radio 5 Live & talkSPORT. Referee: Cuneyt Cakir (Turkey). This will be a close game but I think the Dutch will go through, thanks in part to their inspirational manager. Van Gaal got his players together early to prepare for the World Cup and he pays such attention to detail. His decision to bring on Tim Krul against Costa Rica for the penalties was inspired. Everything has been going Van Gaal’s way so he may feel cocky enough to try another tactical tweak tonight.  I’ve been impressed by his coaching staff, too — they are his lieutenants on the sidelines, all playing individual roles and feeding him information. That way his head isn’t buried in a notebook and he can focus on the game and his tactics. The main man: Louis van Gaal's tactical nous and ability to make big calls is a massive boost for Holland . VIDEO Van Gaal hopeful on Van Persie fitness . Argentina have only beaten Holland once in all competitions — in the 1978 final . One of the most interesting things about this World Cup has been the flexible systems and the refusal of players to be pigeon-holed. Dirk Kuyt has played in three positions and excelled in them all. He has been magnificent as a wing back but his experience as a striker also gives him a creative and attacking edge. Mr Versatile: Dirk Kuyt has proved to be a vital cog in Van Gaal's machine . Martin Demichelis is unrecognisable from the Manchester City defender of last season, with his flowing locks long gone. He was impressive against Belgium, dealing well with their more direct approach, but against the speed of Robben and Co, it will be a different test altogether.

"An Englishman scoring a hat-trick in the Champions League is a rare phenomenon. Only Wayne Rooney (September 2004 v Fenerbahce) and Michael Owen (December 2009 v Wolfsburg) have managed it in the past 10 years. Arsenal's Danny Welbeck celebrates completing his hat-trick on Wednesday night . Danny Welbeck joined Mike Newell, Andy Cole (with two), Alan Shearer, Owen (twice) and Rooney in the European hat-trick club. Newell scored the fastest-ever hat-trick in the Champions League, netting his three goals in a spell of only nine minutes for Blackburn against Rosenborg in 1995. Cole scored his first hat-trick for Manchester United against Feyenoord in 1997 and his second against Anderlecht in 2000. Shearer claimed his treble for Newcastle against Bayer Leverkusen in 2003.

Bizarre sights at the Emirates with Galatasaray keeper Fernando Muslera acting as chief fire officer, extinguishing the flurry of flares thrown onto the pitch by his own fans. It took Wesley Sneijder and Muslera to calm down the Galatasaray fans, who had been angered when one of their number was ejected by police. Galatasaray goalkeeper Fernando Muslera carries a flare off the pitch at the Emirates . It took a while before a steward arrived with a sand bucket to finish the operation. Beware the latest fashion in holding midfielders — they’re not always the answer. It’s only a few years since Felipe Melo was being touted as the answer to Arsene Wenger’s problems in that area. Felipo Melo was fortunate only to receive a yellow card for wild challenge on Alexis . That’s the same Felipe Melo who was brushed aside by Danny Welbeck for the second goal, who was lucky to stay on for his tackle on Alexis and who was at the heart of the shambolic defensive performance. The official attendance was 59,803, Arsenal past masters in the ‘tickets sold’ method of calculating home crowds. But there were plenty of empty seats for Arsenal’s opening home Champions League fixture, even if not quite as many as at Manchester City’s Etihad Stadium on Tuesday night. Theo Walcott was in the crowd for Arsenal's Champions League tie on Wednesday . As Gunners boss Arsene Wenger said in the build-up to the game, the group stages of the Champions League aren’t quite the sell they once were. Galatasaray players must have been grateful for the fact that Graeme Souness was confined to the TV studio and not managing following their awful defending. Quite what Souness would have made of their first half performance can only be imagined. The former Galatasaray manager of course was famous for marching onto the pitch after a cup win at Istanbul rivals Fenerbahce and planting a flag in the centre circle.","Danny Welbeck becomes only third Englishman to score a Champions League hat-trick in last 10 years .

"Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff said he would re-break his arm if it offered a guarantee neither of his team's cars would endure any more reliability issues this season. Following Nico Rosberg's early retirement in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix, there is deep concern inside Mercedes the destiny of the title will be determined more by luck than by skill out on the track. Mercedes have scored seven one-two finishes this year and are poised to wrap up the constructors' crown in one of the next two races in Japan or Russia. Mercedes boss Toto Wolff says he would do anything to avoid more mechanical issues this season . But there have now been four mechanical retirements - two apiece for Lewis Hamilton and Rosberg - plus issues for the former in both Germany and Hungary in qualifying that cost him points. With Hamilton now in possession of the championship lead for only the second time this season, and first time in four months, just three points separate him from Rosberg. It is almost a level-playing field, effectively making the rest of the season a five-race title fight, but with both drivers knowing another reliability hit could prove fatal to their title hopes. Wolff, who broke his right arm and collarbone in a cycling accident two months ago, said: 'We have a great team dedicated to quality, and I'm really proud of that department. Both Nico Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton have failed to finish twice each because of mechanical faults . 'Despite that, it's even more astonishing we continue to have these issues. 'I guess it takes time for the whole group to come together and time until we stop suffering from these DNFs (did not finish) which are unacceptable for us as we have had four of them now. 'If we could do anything more to stop the DNFs then we would do it. I would break my arm again! 'We just have to get on top of the problems.' Asked as to whether he was worried unreliability would prove to be the decisive factor, Wolff replied: 'That is something that would not be satisfying at all. Hamilton won in Singapore to take him top of the drivers' standings for only the second time this season . 'We don't want any spin in there that the championship was decided because one car let down the driver. 'We need to re-focus, get our heads down and keep concentrating on what we can do, what the utmost is, to prevent reliability problems for Nico and Lewis.' After Rosberg's car suffered a wiring loom failure inside the steering column prior to the race from which the German retired after 14 laps, Wolff conceded to worry Hamilton would not win. 'When you have one car remaining, and it's the only weapon out there, then you have doubts about everything,' said Wolff. Rosberg had problems both on the grid and in the pit lane in Singapore and eventually retired on lap 15 . 'It was clear when Lewis' last pit stop was okay and he came out two seconds behind Sebastian (Vettel) that he would probably get ahead, but up until that point there was always a doubt.' Prior to that stop Hamilton had to produce an astonishing performance to open up a gap of 27 seconds to his pursuers, none of whom had to pit again, to ensure he remained in the hunt for the win once he emerged back on track. 'That was really awesome,' added Wolff. 'These are the Lewis Hamilton days, when you recognise how great he is, and it makes the difference between the superstars and the stars, the very best and best ones.'","Nico Rosberg retired after mechanical problems in Singapore .

"Nico Rosberg plans to 'dig in' with all at Mercedes in a bid to ensure this year's Formula One world title is not decided by gremlins and good luck. After leading the championship standings for all but the Monaco Grand Prix in May since winning the opener in Australia, Rosberg finds himself in the unusual position of being the hunter rather than the hunted. Retirement from Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix due to a wiring loom failure in the steering column, combined with Lewis Hamilton's win, means Rosberg trails his team-mate by three points going into the final five races. Nico Rosberg retired early from the Singapore Grand Prix due to issues with his car . With four technical retirements to their name, Mercedes have incurred three more than Ferrari and Williams, two more than McLaren, and as many as Red Bull - remarkable when you consider the trouble they were in during pre-season. Throw in a number of other issues such as those suffered by Rosberg in Canada, and for Hamilton during qualifying in Germany and Hungary, and you can appreciate the deep concern going forward. Hamilton, Rosberg and Mercedes motorsport boss Toto Wolff have all stated this week the destiny of the title must be decided on track, not via failures. Rosberg's race ended when he could not get out of the pit lane due to mechanical problems . It is why Rosberg is eager to play his part and help the team leave no stone unturned to ensure he and Hamilton stay trouble-free. 'There is no reason why we keep having these faults,' said Rosberg. 'It's clear that's the point we need to focus on the most because the performance is there, as we saw again in the race with Lewis' car which was strong, so it's the reliability that needs to be improved. 'I now want to dig in with the team to try to understand what went wrong. 'It's not that I'll be demanding anything different from what I've asked and hoped for in the past because they are already focusing a lot on reliability. Lewis Hamilton won the Singapore Grand Prix and over took Rosberg in the drivers' championship . 'They are working crazy hours, working hard, but maybe there is a need to review their approach and try to improve in that area. 'That's not a demand because the whole team wants the same thing, I want the same thing. 'Everybody is doing the best possible job, but we need to try and improve.' Following his retirement under the lights of the Marina Bay Street Circuit, Rosberg showed what Wolff described as 'professionalism' by remaining at the track rather than heading back to his hotel in a huff. Instead, Rosberg took full advantage of his time out of the car as the remainder of the race unfolded by joining Wolff and executive technical director Paddy Lowe on the pit wall. Rosberg added: 'I decided, rather than leaving, to see if I could pick up anything that might come in useful for the next couple of races. 'Did I learn anything? Of course, I always learn. I've never watched the other car live in a race and now I've seen the pit wall work together during a race this year, so I got a lot of insights.'","German driver has lost lead in title race to Lewis Hamilton .

"UEFA has ordered Partizan Belgrade to play their next Europa League home game with a partial closure of their stadium after an anti-Semitic banner was displayed in their fixture against Tottenham. The sign, based on the Only Fools and Horses logo, read 'Only Jews and Pussies' and was branded as unacceptable by Spurs boss Mauricio Pochettino after the game on September 18. UEFA has acted and told Partizan that their next fixture against Besiktas will be played with the 'K' section of their stadium shut. The club have also been fined 40,000 euros (£31,430).

"A 14-year-old schoolboy has been jailed after he barricaded his teacher inside a classroom then laughed as he sexually assaulted her. Desperate colleagues tried to break down the door when they heard the teacher screaming for help but could not stop the boy, now 15, from Wrexham. Staff fought their way into the school's computer room and pulled the 'distressed and terrified' teacher to safety. The teenager, who admitted sexual assault and was sentenced to four years’ youth detention, had put his hand up her skirt and forced himself on her. 'Terrified': Staff had to fight their way into the school's computer room and pulled the 'distressed' teacher to safety after the attack, Mold Crown Court (pictured) heard . Prosecutor Karl Scholz told Mold Crown Court: 'The teacher and the boy were in the classroom when he closed the door and snapped the latch shut. 'He told her he had things on his mind and took hold of her and hugged her. 'She managed to get away and wanted to leave the room but realised the door was locked. 'The schoolboy then put his hand up the teacher’s skirt and carried out a serious sexual assault on her.' Mr Scholz said staff outside could hear their colleague scream and the boy laughing. Attack: The boy sexually assaulted the victim after barricading them into the school's computer room (file picture) When they eventually got in the teacher was 'very distressed' and had a 'terrified' expression on her face. Mold Crown Court court was told the teacher had been unable to return to work since the horrific school sex attack at the 700-pupil high school in North Wales. The schoolboy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, had previous convictions for two sexual assaults and was on bail for a third when he attacked his teacher. Steven Edwards, defending, said the boy had suffered a difficult childhood and had been the victim of abuse. Judge Greg Bull QC told the schoolboy: 'You attacked one of your teachers, barricaded her into the computer room and forced yourself on her. 'It was a terrifying experience for a woman who was only there to try and help you.' The teenager was also placed on the sex offenders’ register for life.","Staff at North Wales school forced to break into classroom to save teacher .

"Rudolph Hess, Hitler's Deputy, offered peace for Western Europe - in exchange for a clear path to attack the Soviets . The Nazis attempted to broker a peace offering with Britain - if they were allowed a free path to attack the USSR, a new book has revealed. Rudolf Hess's flight to Britain during World War Two to sign a peace deal ordered by Adolf Hitler has long been recorded as a bizarre one man mission to try and reconcile warring West Europe and the Nazis. But the high-ranking Nazi was actually carrying out orders from the Fuhrer when he flew to Messerschmitt to Scotland in May 1941. He was to offer the British government a deal that would see Germany pull out of Western Europe - so long as the fascists could attack the USSR without intervention. But historian Peter Padfield has discovered evidence he claims proves that the deputy Fuhrer held a detailed peace treaty. It proposed that the Nazis would withdraw from western Europe, in exchange for British neutrality over a planned attack on Russia, the Daily Telegraph reported. The researcher claims in a new book that a German-speaking unnamed informant told him he was called in to translate the documents that showed Germany wanted a clear path to attack the Soviets within five weeks. Hess' mission began with him parachuting out over Renfrewshire where he was arrested by a farmhand with a pitchfork. The Third Reich deputy wanted to contact the Duke of Hamilton to set peace talks with Winston Churchill in motion. No deal: Sir Winston Churchill refused to agree to Hitler's peace deal offered by Hess . But despite the offer, Churchill's morals were not swayed by the offer. He refused to allow the Third Reich a clear path to attack the Eastern Front - because he did not trust Hitler's promises and it would have jeopardised his efforts to involve the U.S in the raging war, Mr Padfield says. The author claims the Prime Minister was determined to beat Hitler and he did not want to destroy a coalition of European governments, so the offer was not made public. Mr Padfield, who makes the claims in a new book, Hess, Hitler and Churchill, said: 'This was not a renegade plot. 'Hitler had sent Hess and he brought over a fully developed peace treaty for Germany to evacuate all the occupied countries in the West.' Hess survived the war and was tried at Nuremberg for war crimes. He was sentenced to life imprisonment and spent more time behind bars than any other Third Reich leaders before taking his own life in Spandau Prison near Berlin in 1987, aged 93. At Nuremberg Hess appeared to be the delusional, forgetful, mentally ill figure that Hitler claimed he was after the abortive mission. David Maclean, the ploughman who caught Rudolph Hess . It was an act recorded as a one-man mad mission. Hess was, apparently, trying to set peace talks with Winston Churchill in motion under his own initiative. Hitler was even supposed to have scrambled aircraft to try to stop Hess, his deputy, from leaving Germany. But a 28-page notebook discovered in a Russian archive in 2011 disputes this theory and indicates that Hitler was in on the mission. It was written in 1948 by Major Karlheinz Pintsch, a long-time adjutant to Hess. He was captured by the Soviets and spent years undergoing  torture and interrogation at  their hands. In the notebook he writes that Hitler hoped that an ‘agreement with the Englishmen would be successful’. Pintsch notes that Hess’s task – five weeks before Germany launched its invasion of Russia – was to ‘bring about, if not a military alliance of Germany with England against Russia, then to bring about a neutralisation of England’. Pintsch’s interrogation transcripts found in the same archive in Moscow show that Hitler was not surprised when news came through of Hess’s capture. The relevant section reads: 'Nor did he rant and rave about what Hess had done. Instead, he replied calmly: 'At this particular moment in the war that could be a most hazardous escapade.' 'Hitler then went on to read a letter that Hess had sent him. 'He read the following significant passage out aloud: ""And if this project . . . ends in failure . . . it will always be possible for you to deny all responsibility. Simply say I was out of my mind"".' This is what would happen after the mission failed, with both Hitler and Churchill claiming Hess was deranged.","The high-ranking Nazi was carrying out orders from the Fuhrer .

"Japanese trainer Naosuke Sugai believes never having won over a mile and a half is no barrier to Just A Way winning Sunday’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp. The five-year-old, rated the top racehorse in the world after his six-length romp in the Dubai Duty Free in March, heads a three-strong challenge from his country for Europe’s most prestigious all-age race. But his only run at the distance resulted in an unplaced effort in the 2012 Japanese Derby and his only outing since Dubai was a win over a mile. Naosuke Sugai is confident Find A Way can triumph at Sunday's Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe at Longchamp . Japan's Sugai doesn't believe Find A Way's lack of form beyond a mile and a half is a hindrance . Yuichi Goto of the Japanese Racing Association, said: ‘Just A Way’s ideal distance is one mile two furlongs but his trainer Mr Sugai, after Just A Way won by over six lengths in Dubai, is very confident he will adapt for the longer distance.’ Just A Way plus Harp Star, winner of Japan’s 1,000 Guineas and second in her country’s Oaks, and Gold Ship work at Chantilly racecourse on Wednesday. Japan has gone close to winning the Arc, most notably when Orfevre handed the 2012 prize to outsider Solemia by hanging dramatically in the final furlong. Hopes he could gain compensation 12 months ago were crushed by Treve. Just A Way (7-1), Harp Star (8-1) and Gold Ship (11-1) are all prominent in the betting to break their country’s duck. Goto added: ‘Each has different characteristics. Just A Way has good speed, Gold Ship good stamina and Harp Star is the first three-year-old filly from Japan to run in the race.’ Harp Star, winner of Japan’s 1,000 Guineas, is working with Find A Way and Gold Ship at Chantilly racecourse .

"Jockey Andrea Atzeni will be used ahead of Jamie Spencer on two-year-olds owned by Qatar Racing for the remainder of the season in order to familiarise himself with their string ahead of taking over as No 1 jockey next year. David Redvers, racing manager to Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s organisation, has confirmed the arrangement, which will also involve handing two-year-old rides where possible to Oisin Murphy, Atzeni’s Qatar Racing understudy in 2015. But Redvers emphasised that Spencer will continue to be the first choice on the team’s older horses until his retirement at the end of the season. Andrea Atzeni is replacing Jamie Spencer as No 1 jockey at Qatar Racing from next season . David Redvers, racing manager to Sheik Fahad Al Thani’s organisation, has confirmed the recent news . Talented Irish rider Oisin Murphy will also be handed two-year-old rides where possible . Spencer will ride Side Glance as he returns to Australia, where he won last year’s Mackinnon Stakes, and be the pick for a Breeders’ Cup squad which could include Just The Judge, Trade Storm and Secret Gesture. Atzeni, arguably the jockey of the season and due to ride his St Leger winner Kingston Hill in Sunday’s Prix de L’Arc de Triomphe, was on board the Sheik’s new purchase Elm Park, winner of the Group Two Royal Lodge Stakes at Newmarket on Saturday. The Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster on October 25 could now be on the agenda for the Andrew Balding-trained colt. Redvers said: ‘There is no doubt Andrea is a young jockey going forward at a fast rate. He has lots of confidence and his ride on Elm Park, who wasn’t going anywhere three furlongs out showed great maturity. Atzeni pictured riding Elm Park wins The Juddmonte Royal Lodge Stakes at Newmarket racecourse . Spencer is retiring from as first jockey at Qatar Racing, allowing Atzeni to come in . ‘Our intention is to give Andrea and Oisin as much experience as possible of the two-year-olds going into the winter as their commitments allow.’ Qatar Racing’s Derby fourth Arod, who hasn’t run since his fifth to Australia in the International Stakes at York in August and was forced to miss Friday’s Joel Stakes at Newmarket, is being lined up for the Group One Queen Elizabeth, his first run at a mile since his debut last year. Redvers said: ‘It was bizarre, Arod choked eating some straw and in the process he broke a tooth. There was some serious inflammation and he had to be treated with antibiotics. ‘It was a shame as we would have like to have tried him over a mile before the QEII. After the Derby, we thought he was a mile and a half horse but he has got stronger and quicker as he has got older and they just have not been going quick enough in his races. ‘We hope dropping back to a mile will be the key to him.’ OL MAN RIVER is a 10-1 shot for the 2015 Derby with Coral after a clear-cut two-and-three-quarter-length win in the Group Two Beresford Stakes at the Curragh. Trainer Aidan O’Brien said the impeccably-bred colt could run again this season. He holds entries in the Dewhurst Stakes and Racing Post Trophy.","Andrea Atzeni will take priority over Jamie Spencer for the rest of the season and be used on the two-year olds owned by Qatar Racing .

"A television series about crime-busting Rastafarian mice on the BBC was the most complained about children's programme last year, it has been revealed. Rastamouse attracted more than 200 complaints because of the way it 'stereotyped black people' and because of the 'patois' language . used by the Jamaican mouse characters. The CBeebies show, which has run for two series, attracted 13 complaints when the first episode was aired last January. There have since been 200 further complaints. Scroll down for video . Stereotypes: The BBC show Rastamouse attracted more than 200 complaints last year . The BBC has defended the Bafta-nominated show, . which features an all-mouse reggae band - Rastamouse and Da Easy Crew. The puppet mouse spreads love and respect as leader of the Easycrew. He uses patois language - and phrases such as 'me wan go' for 'I want to go' and 'wagwan' for 'what's going on?'. The CBeebies series is aimed at children under six. Parents have complained on Mumsnet that children using the same language as the mice could be accused of racism. One Mumsnet user, TinyD4ncer, asked fellow users for advice on whether to stop their child watching the programme, posting: 'I dont want my DD to talk this way. Do you think I should stop her watching it? 'Wa'gwan' - What's going on . 'Tings is ruff' - Things are bad . 'Make a bad ting good' - Making the best of a bad situation . 'Irie'  - Jamaican word meaning 'to be at total peace with your current state of being' 'Me tink me know who de t’ieving mouse may be' - I think I know who the thieveing mouse is. 'The thing I'm most worried about is her knowing/saying the words like 'rasta'. '(I) Suppose what I'm saying is if my white child walked up to your Caribbean/Black etc child and said this, what would you feel - or nothing? - as I wouldn't want to walk away with a black eye?' One user leaving a comment on MailOnline said: 'Frankly this programme is insulting because it uses a lazy stereotype. 'Most . educated black people in this country who were born here speak the same . as their white peers - some of us have cockney accents, others have RP . accents. I am black and have an RP accent as I was the product of . private schooling, university etc. 'Children need to lean to speak English properly and I do not understand why having this character would assist that process. 'If . the programme makers want to introduce more diversity why not have a . black character who speaks like a normal British born black person . instead of a character that has a Jamaican accent. 'Surely this makes sense given that we are not living in Jamaica.' A BBC spokeswoman said nine out of ten complaints had been about the language spoken by the characters. She said: 'This was one of our most popular children's programmes last year. Channel 5: Chat show The Wright Stuff received more complaints than any other TV show last year after host Matthew Wright made crass remarks about Amanda Knox and an insensitive joke about the death of a Scottish teenager .

"Hundreds of gay rights activists held a peaceful protest at the California mall where a couple were told to leave because they were kissing and holding hands. Daniel Chesmore, 21, and Jose Guzman, 24, recorded a security guard at the Roseville mall in Sacramento, California telling them: 'If you continue to kiss, you will be asked to leave the mall. Period.' Guzman said afterwards: 'I feel like we’re always treated differently because we’re gay. It makes me sad.' The aim of Saturday's rally was to get the mall .

Hundreds of gay rights activists turned out for the peaceful protest . 'What's important is love, and all love is love, and we respect individuals and their right to love.' she said she hoped the mall would have better training for their employees. Robert Woodward, who attended the . Love is Love rally, said: 'We have every right, just as everyone does, . to feel comfortable in our own skin, loving our partners.' People at the event carried banners with the hashtag '#loveislove' and wore T-shirts emblazoned with the slogan. During the recording by the couple, the voice, allegedly of the security guard, said: 'I counted you guys kissing 25 times.' The security guard told the couple, who are teachers at an elementary school in Oakland, California, that he would eject anyone for such public displays of affection. Roseville Galleria staff offered food . and water for everyone at the rally and said they wanted everyone to be . comfortable at the event. Initially the mall defended the security guard's actions but changed its mind after the response from the community.

"Changing views: A Church of England paper backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Justin Welby (pictured) has signalled that gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church . The Church of England yesterday signalled that gay couples should be able to have their relationships blessed in church. It said priests may 'devise accommodations’ for same-sex couples 'who seek to engage with the challenges of life responsibly’. It suggests that public prayers which recognise gay relationships could be introduced in church services by sympathetic clergy. Yesterday’s paper, backed by Archbishop of Canterbury Dr Justin Welby and the leading bishops, does not change the CofE laws which say homosexual activity is sinful and ban priests from blessing gay relationships. But it appeared to encourage same-sex couples, saying the Church must show a 'degree of flexibility’ over gay relationships, and adding: 'the Church does not treat questions of what is possible in hard circumstances or exceptional conditions as simply closed.’ The proposal will infuriate traditionalists and is likely to reignite the bitter conflict within the Church over same-sex relationships. The document likened the case of same-sex relationships to the controversy a decade ago over the remarriage of divorcees. This ended with divorcees officially allowed to have second weddings in church, if they can find a sympathetic priest, even though CofE doctrines say marriage is for life. The new paper on the church and marriage comes at a time of conflict between the CofE and David Cameron’s Government over same-sex marriage. Laws permitting men to marry men and women to marry women are likely to be on the statute book within months. The Church, along with other major faith organisations, has protested that the Government has no power to change the principle that marriage must be between a man and a woman. The CofE has warned that the new law could lead to disestablishment, the severing of the 480-year-old link between the Church and the state. One of the bishops who produced the document, the Bishop of Coventry the Right Reverend Christopher Cocksworth, said the paper did not mean that churches could stage public services of blessing for gay couples, which are banned by Church law. He said that priests might offer such couples 'attention, care and prayer’. But campaigners for gay rights in the Church said the paper meant a green light for clergy who wish to give public recognition to gay relationships. 'Devising accommodations': In a foreword, Dr Welby said the paper has been published because 'it would be timely to produce a short summary of the Church of England's understanding of marriage' Dr Giles Fraser, a former Canon of St Paul’s Cathedral who is now priest-in-charge of a South London church, said: 'You cannot escape what is down in this document in black and white. 'This is saying you can bless same-sex relationships as long as you don’t say what you are doing. It is a wink to people like me who want to go ahead. 'It is coded language which says do it, but don’t advertise.’ He suggested clergy might offer communion services in which a same-sex couple would be invited to the altar rail during the blessing at the end of the ceremony. In a foreword, Dr Welby said the paper has been published because 'it would be timely to produce a short summary of the Church of England’s understanding of marriage.’ It restates the CofE’s position that marriage must be between a man and a woman, and adds that marriage is the ideal platform for bringing up children. Tensions: The new paper on the church and marriage comes at a time of conflict between the CofE and David Cameron's Government over same-sex marriage . But the paper said 'in pastoral responses a degree of flexibility may be called for in finding ways to express the Church’s teaching practically.’ It warned that 'the meaning of such pastoral accommodations can be misunderstood’. However, the paper said the Church can 'devise accommodations for specific conditions, bearing witness in special ways to the abiding importance of the norm.’ The bishops said that although marriage should be for life, the 2002 rules on remarriage for divorcees 'offer pastoral support to those who with great honesty and circumspection approach a further marriage.’ In another comparison, they said that Anglican churches in Africa baptise people even though they are living in polygamous relationships. The Church, along with other Christian denominations which do not recognise same-sex marriage, will be banned from staging same-sex weddings under Mr Cameron’s same-sex marriage law. But Church of England leaders - who are bound by law to offer marriage to any qualified couple who ask for it - fear they will be vulnerable to human rights court challenges when gay couples are turned away by churches. Dr Cocksworth said clergy could offer same-sex couples the support of prayer. 'The form of prayer will depend upon the particular circumstances of the particular case,’ he said. 'But we are talking about that sort of pastoral care if you like, and prayer, rather than something which is more formal and more public. This is part of the private, the personal, compassionate attention that a priest would give to people. It is not about public, formal recognition.’","Church may introduce public prayers which recognise gay relationships .

"Morality police in the Ukraine are trying to get Nickelodeon cartoon SpongeBob Squarepants banned because of its perceived 'promotion of homosexuality'. The Ukraine's National Expert Commission for Protecting Public Morality released the report, calling the children's cartoon a 'real threat to children'. Some of the other shows under fire include Family Guy, Pokemon, The Simpsons and Teletubbies, which the report says 'projects aimed at the destruction of the family, and the promotion of drugs and other vices'. Holding hands: SpongeBob Squarepants has been accused of promoting homosexuality, because SpongeBob holds hands with his friend Patrick . Creating 'imbeciles': The Ukraine's National Expert Commission for Protecting Public Morality says Teletubbies promotes drug use . The report says that Teletubbies sends children into a trance and creates 'an imbecile who will sit near the screen with an open mouth and swallow any information'. It also criticises the fact that one of the stars of the BBC children's show, Tinky Winky, carries what looks like a woman's handbag, saying: 'in real life, boys very rarely want to put on girls' clothes'. Cartoon star SpongeBob has a large gay fanbase in the U.S. as well as a being a huge hit with children. The 'evidence' that points to SpongeBob's homosexuality seems to extend to the fact that he regularly holds hands with a pink starfish called Patrick, who is also his best friend. Singled out: Family Guy and Pokemon were among other cartoons that the Ukraine morality watchdog wants to see banned from the country's TV screens . The Simpsons: Despite more than a decade of relatively trouble-free episodes, popular Fox TV show has also come under Ukrainian criticism . Equally suspect, apparently, is the fact that SpongeBob lives in an underwater pineapple and receives boating lessons from a teacher called Mrs Puff - 'puff' being both a derogatory and affectionate term to describe a gay man. Creator Stephen Hillenburg has defended his creation in the past, saying: 'I always think of him as being somewhat asexual. He added: 'Everybody is different, and the show embraces that. The character SpongeBob is an oddball. He's kind of weird, but he's kind of special.' The Wall Street Journal reported in the past that some of the cartoon's reported $500m merchandise sales have come from gay men purchasing branded toys, lunch boxes and even thongs.",Morality commission also says Teletubbies promotes 'drugs and other vices'
"Rapist: Hamidullah Hamidi should have been deported in November, but stayed in the UK and raped a 14-year-old . An illegal immigrant dragged a teenage girl with learning difficulties from the streets and raped her in his home - a month after a warrant had been issued to have him deported. Hamidullah Hamidi, 19, tempted his 'extremely vulnerable' 14-year-old victim from outside a shop in Bristol by offering her money. He took the girl - who has a mental age of seven - to a deserted street before dragging her home, locking her inside and raping her, a court heard. Hamidi has now been jailed for six years after admitting one count of rape at Bristol Crown Court. The court heard that Hamidi, an Afghan national, fled his home country as a child to avoid fighting for the Taliban and was raised by a foster family in Britain. He was given limited leave to stay in the country, which he exceeded, leading to a warrant being issued to have him deported. Hamidi was supposed to leave the UK last November, but was still in the country on December 8 when the attack took place. Judge Michael Longman said that Hamidi would serve half his prison sentence before being deported. Sentencing, he said: 'Your victim was just 14 at the time when you raped her. She was plainly an extremely vulnerable girl. 'You saw her in the shop and left and waited for her to come out. You offered her money as a lure and she accompanied you. 'You led her physically to your home address where you locked her in and raped her. When she was able to leave and make off, you followed her until you were stopped from doing so. You caused her severe psychological harm.' The court was told Hamidi’s victim suffers from significant learning difficulties and intellectually functions at the level of a seven-year-old child. Overstayer: Bristol Crown Court heard how a warrant had been issued for Hamidi's deportation . Prosecuting, Giles Nelson said Hamidi was classed as an 'overstayer', with attempts to deport him made at his home on November 11 last year. 'The following month, on December 8, his victim went to a shop in Easton,' Mr Nelson said. 'The defendant was in the shop and is seen to leave the shop then wait outside for the victim to emerge, which she did. 'The defendant offered to give her money, she agreed and went with the defendant. He grabbed her and pulled her along with him. 'She was trying to stop him but couldn’t and there was no one else there.' Hamidi dragged the girl to his home and locked her inside before raping her, Mr Nelson said. The girl later told police: 'I said ""Can you stop, please"" but he wasn’t having it.' Hamidi eventually allowed the girl to leave the property and she fled, before approaching members of the public on a nearby street for help. 'She was seen to be extremely frightened indeed,' Mr Nelson added. 'Her mother says that she has had no sexual encounters and has been left with severe psychological harm.' Hamidi was arrested by police on December 11 and initially denied the attack but later admitted it in court. Representing Hamidi, Stephen Mooney said his client was still appreciating 'the enormity of what he has done'. 'He came to this country from Afghanistan to prevent him from being sent to fight for the Taliban,' Mr Mooney said. 'His father had sympathies for the organisation. His mother did not share those views.' Mr Mooney said Hamidi had been placed within a foster family in Britain and attended college. 'He has thrown away all that he has in this country,' Mr Mooney added. Hamidi, who wore grey tracksuit bottoms and a black jumper in court, remained emotionless as the sentence was passed.","Hamidullah Hamidi, 19, targeted 'vulnerable' girl outside a shop in Bristol .

"A ghost ship infested with hundreds of cannibalistic rats may end up beaching on Britain's coastline, experts have warned. The abandoned Lyubov Orlova has been missing since it cut adrift while being towed from Canada nearly a year ago. Coastguards fear the 40-year-old liner was driven across the North Atlantic by high winds and is now lurking worryingly close to the UK shoreline. Searchers say there are likely to be . hundreds, if not thousands, of disease-ridden rats on board with no . source of food except each other. Bound for Britain? The abandoned Lyubov Orlova may be bringing hundreds of disease-ridden cannibal rats to the UK after cutting adrift in the North Atlantic a year ago . Mystery of the missing liner: The ship was being towed from Newfoundland to the Dominican Republic in January last year when it cut adrift. Experts fear high winds have pushed it thousands of miles towards the UK . Based on signals from distress beacons thought to have been set off accidentally and an unconfirmed satellite image, it is believed the Soviet vessel could hit the West coast of Ireland, Scotland or the far southern tip of England. Belgian-based searcher Pim de Rhoodes said: 'She is floating around there somewhere. There will be a lot of rats and they eat each other.' A spokesman for the UK Maritime and Coastguard Agency said: ‘We have received no reported sightings of the vessel since April, but we will respond accordingly.’ The 4,250-ton Lyubov Orlova - which was built to carry 110 passengers - was impounded in Newfoundland in 2010 after being deserted by her crew over a debt row. Two years later, she was towed to the Dominican Republic to be scrapped.

But when she came loose, the Canadian government decided to drag her far out to sea and leave her there. Adventurers - who want to cash in on the ship's £600,000 value as scrap - do not believe she has sunk because the life-raft transmitters would have gone off. The sign of her since has been two distress beacons picked up mid-Atlantic in March last year which are thought to have gone off when life-rafts fell into the water. A few weeks later, a satellite spotted a blip off the coast of Scotland big enough to be the ship, but no vessel was found. After that, nothing has been seen of the 300ft liner. Irish coastguard Chris Reynolds said: 'We must stay vigilant. 'We don’t want rats from foreign ships coming onto Irish soil. If it came and broke up on shore, I’m sure local people wouldn’t be very happy about it.’ The Lyubov is now gaining in notoriety in . internet discussion forums, an iPhone app called Find Orlova and its . own Twitter account.","Lyubov Orlova has been missing in the North Atlantic since last January .

"A mysterious joker has been spotted hanging upside down from bus stops and monuments around a city centre - dressed as Batman. The unknown caped crusader has built up an internet following after being spotted around Nottingham over the last few months. Astonishingly, the brazen Batman has been seen suspending himself by his ankles in daylight. The caped crusader is actually a plasterer by day who wants to help 'save people from their misery' The mysterious Batman impersonator has been pictured hanging from his ankles in various places in the city . He has been spotted several times in and around the city's famous town hall. The Batman impersonator, who admits he is actually a plaster who lives near the real Gotham in Nottingham, has even set up his own Facebook account. Speaking on his Facebook page, he wrote: 'There aren't enough people smiling these days and there are too many negative things happening in the world. 'I want to be a positive influence and be the hero who saves people from their misery. Nottingham's superhero said his superpower is the ability to make people laugh . 'As long as people are smiling, that's what it's all about. 'I'm hoping the more people spot me, the more I will be able to raise my profile.

"Lone MI5 agent: The officer was sent to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for Adolf Hitler (pictured) A lone MI5 agent went undercover to neutralise hundreds of Nazi sympathisers living in Britain during the Second World War, extraordinary secret papers reveal today. The officer, given the alias Jack King, was sent to infiltrate groups of traitors by security chiefs alarmed at the strength of support for Hitler. By posing as an undercover Gestapo officer, King was able to control groups of ‘Fifth Columnists’ who were trying to aid the Fascist cause. The Nazi sympathisers believed they were successfully passing secrets to Berlin – but all the while the information was being handed straight to MI5, say the newly declassified files released by the National Archives. MI5 acquired replica Iron Crosses to reward members of King’s network for their loyalty to the Fuhrer. Officials even drew up plans to issue the Nazi sympathisers with badges to be worn in the event of an invasion – supposedly to identify them to the Germans as friends but in fact to enable them to be rounded up by police. The traitors were never prosecuted, to avoid blowing future operations, and went to their graves believing they had helped Hitler. By the end of the war, King – also known as SR – had monitored and controlled the activities of hundreds of would-be traitors. Had the network not been penetrated, it could have done significant harm, MI5 said. 'Helping out': The Nazi sympathisers believed they were successfully passing secrets to Berlin. German troops are pictured marching into Prague during the invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939 . The Nazi sympathisers, based mainly in London and the south of England, used messages written in invisible ink and other ruses to pass details of Home Guard operations and intelligence on jet propulsion and radar systems. King’s work started when he was tasked . with gauging the extent of Nazi support among employees of Siemens in . the UK. The company was known to have provided a cover for Nazi . espionage. But the plan changed when in 1942, he met a ‘crafty and dangerous woman’. Marita Perigoe, said to be of mixed . Swedish and German origin, was married to a member of Oswald Mosley’s . British Union of Fascists who had been interned in Brixton Prison. Second World War: MI5 acquired replica Iron Crosses to reward members of King's network for their loyalty to the Fuhrer. German soldiers are pictured moving into a burning Russia village in June 1941 . She, however, had no time for the BUF, regarding them as ‘insufficiently extreme’. The . MI5 files state: ‘She was found to be so violently anti-British and so . anxious to do anything in her power to help the enemy that it was felt . that special attention should be paid to her. ‘Marita Perigoe is not a neurotic nor . feminine type; she is a masterful and somewhat masculine woman. Both in . appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant Hun.’ King . managed to convince her that he was a Gestapo representative looking . for people ‘a hundred per cent loyal to the Fatherland’ who could be . relied upon to help the Nazis in the event of an invasion. Undercover: Initially King sought to exploit the group's taste for cloak-and-dagger operations, offering to supply them with invisible ink. Damage from the Blitz in Manchester in 1940 is pictured . Initially he sought to exploit the group’s taste for cloak-and-dagger operations, offering to supply them with invisible ink. 'Marita Perigoe is not a neurotic nor feminine type; she is a masterful and somewhat masculine woman. Both in appearance and mentality she can be described as an arrogant Hun' ‘The . organisation has certain somewhat melodramatic ideas about secret . service work and to gratify these a suitable meeting place in the . basement of an antique shop has been found,’ MI5 reported in 1942. ‘Arrangements have been made to record any conversations.’ MI5 files note that while some of the . Fifth Columnists had a ‘lack of balance’ or were ‘semi-lunatic’ they . were still dangerous ‘since Hitler himself is stated on occasions to . bite the carpet’. One, . Hilda Leech, was ‘unstable and neurotic’ and violently anti-Semitic. She . tried to pass on reports about highly secret research to develop a jet . aircraft. Newly declassified: The extraordinary secret papers have been released by the National Archives . Edgar Whitehead, an astrologer, was passing on information about secret trials of a new amphibious tank. The National Council for Civil  Liberties – now known as  Liberty – gave prominent roles to two suspected Communists, the secret files reveal. One man, Kenelm Hubert Digby, who is described as ‘a sincere lifelong Communist’, held the role of legal adviser in the 1940s. A second individual, Geoffrey Cecil Bing, was an NCCL member and also part of the Communist Party’s secret legal group. He was elected a Labour MP in the 1945 Clement Atlee landslide. Labour became paranoid the party was being infiltrated by Communists and asked MI5 to vet a list of its MPs, but security officials refused. Bing lost his seat in 1955 and became an adviser to Ghana PM Kwame Nkrumah, where he was described by the Security Service as ‘the most formidable threat to British interests there’. As King’s network expanded, MI5 was looking at new ways to subvert its activities. The files state: ‘It is proposed at a later stage to provide all members of the organisation with badges, which will probably take the form of some innocuous object like the Union Jack, which they will be instructed to hide until orders are given from headquarters. ‘From then onwards they will wear them. The object of this plan is to enable the police easily to identify members of this Fifth Column organisation in time of emergency.’ By the end of the war, Perigoe was one of six agents – all but one of them British – working directly to King. MI5 estimated the number of traitors detailed in his reports ran ‘certainly to scores and probably to hundreds’. Security chiefs at first doubted so many British subjects were traitors. ‘But it gradually became apparent that the bulk of the SR material could be relied on as substantially accurate,’ the files add. King’s work was directed by Lord Rothschild, who praised the ‘staggering tour de force’ performed by the agent. He felt King deserved an MBE not just for the intelligence value of his work but for incurring ‘personal danger from his daily contact with Fascists over a period of years’.","Officer sent by security chiefs alarmed at strength of support for Hitler .

"A dinosaur believed to be a pygmy Tyrannosaurus rex has been discovered. Fossilised skull remains thought to be around 70million years old were found in  icy northern Alaska. Analysis has shown them to be from a  Tyrannosaurus – but one that is much smaller than T-Rex, the largest carnivorous dinosaur ever to walk the Earth. Scroll down for video . An illustration provided by the Perot Museum of Nature and Science shows the size comparison of the T-Rex's smaller cousin (see A and B) Tiny cousin: Scientists concluded that the smaller relative of the Tyrannorsaurys Rex, pictured, the Nanuqsaurus hoglundi, had an adult skull length of 25in . Earth Sciences Curator Tony Fiorillo of the Perot Museum of Nature and Science excavates a site containing the fossils of a newly discovered smaller cousin of the T-Rex named Nanuqsaurus hoglundi . Scientists examined fragments of the skull roof, maxilla and jaw, and concluded that the species, Nanuqsaurus hoglundi, had an adult skull length of 25in (63.5cm). This is less than half the size of the 60in (152.4cm) skull of a T Rex, believed to have been the largest of all carnivorous dinosaurs. Study co-authors Anthony Fiorillo and Ronald Tykoski, from the Perot Museum of Nature and Science in Texas, said the smaller body size may have reflected an adaption to scarcer resources in the Arctic seasons and the species' partial isolation in the north. Slightly bigger: The Nanuqsaurus hoglundi's skull was less than half of the Tyrannosaurus Rex . Tyrannosaurs have captured popular imagination since their discovery but the majority of information about them comes from fossils from low to mid-latitudes of North America and Asia. 'The 'pygmy tyrannosaur' alone is really cool because it tells us something about what the environment was like in the ancient Arctic,' said Mr Fiorillo. 'But what makes this discovery even more exciting is that Nanuqsaurus hoglundi also tells us about the biological richness of the ancient polar world during a time when the Earth was very warm compared to today.'","Skull of small Tyrannosaurus found in northern Alaska .

It might be named for the new world, but the America's Cup has very British origins. First offered by Queen Victoria in 1851, the inaugural America's Cup race was run around the Isle of Wight. After a boat from New York named America triumphed, the cup was renamed and teams from the US have dominated the winner's roll call of honour ever since. But while Britannia might rule the waves . in other respects, a British team is yet to take the trophy which, . despite having been won by Swiss and Australian teams in the past, has . for the most part been doggedly defended by the Americans - among them . last year's winner, San Francisco's Golden Gate Yacht Club - throughout . its 132-year history. That, however, is something the Duchess . of Cambridge and Sir Ben hope to change, and hope, given enough . sponsorship, to assemble a race-winning boat and the sailors to crew it . over the next three years. After chatting with sponsors, among them former Duran Duran star Simon Le Bon, the Duchess toured the museum and was handed a posy by a little flower girl who seemed a bit overwhelmed by the royal visitor. It was a far cry from the Duchess' last engagement - a tea party in Arromanche for D-Day veterans, . where she was given a peck on the cheek by one octogenarian who asked her . whether it was 'OK to kiss a princess'. Arthur Jones, 88, was one of 50 veterans to meet the royal couple and was told, 'Of course it is' when he made his cheeky request. But the former Desert Rat's kiss from a princess did earn him a jokey telling off from the Duke of Cambridge - much to his delight. Mr Jones, from Wolverhampton, added: 'As the Prince left he said to me: ""Were you chatting up my wife?"" I told him I only gave her a kiss. William laughed but I’m chuffed I’ve chatted up a Princess. I bet I’ll be picked up now and taken to the Tower of London! 'It was a lovely kiss – she is very sweet and very lovely. I lost my wife 10 years ago and I’m on my own now so I don’t get many opportunities for kisses any more.' Afterwards, the Duchess and her husband Prince William continued on to Gold Beach, which was was one of two subjected to an assault by British troops, and where they were shown a reconstruction of the events of that day. Leading the charge was the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division commanded by Major General Douglas Alexander Graham, and the 8th Armoured Brigade, but despite the presence of some of the veterans, the fierce fighting also saw more than 400 British soldiers lose their lives.

"Led Zeppelin are due to release a new version of their hit song Stairway to Heaven 40 years after it was first recorded . An unreleased version of one of the most celebrated songs in rock, Stairway To Heaven, is to come out later this year after sitting in the vaults for more than 40 years. An alternative take Stairway, one of Led Zeppelin’s most famous compositions, will be released on a new version of the band’s fourth album due out later this year. Guitarist Jimmy Page has sifted through vintage studio recordings to find different versions of each of the eight tracks from the Led Zeppelin IV album - which first came out in 1971 - for a companion disc to accompany the reissue, part of a remastering of the band’s entire catalogue. The soon-to-be released performance of Stairway dates from a series of mixing sessions at Sunset Sound Studio in Los Angeles. The version which was eventually released was completed at the Island Records studio in London. Also to be issued the same day, October 27, is a remastered version of the group’s House Of The Holy album which again features newly heard takes of seven of the eight songs from that release. New editions of the band’s first three albums came out last month. Founding members of Led Zep - Page, singer Robert Plant and bass player John Paul Jones - famously reunited on stage in 2007 along with Jason Bonham, the son of late drummer John, at a tribute concert for Ahmet Ertegun, the founder of the band’s label Atlantic Records. The song, one of the most played in rock music history, was initially conceived while Led Zeppelin guitarist Jimmy Page was staying an Bron Yr Aur cottage in Wales in 1970. The introduction came to Page during the night, and after he played it to Plant the pair made a series of cassette recordings which would form the basis for the song. Scroll down for video . The recording comes from a session the band did at Sunset Sound Studio in Los Angeles and will be released on a disc along with alternative recordings of all the tracks on Led Zeppelin IV . Today the cottage remains a pilgrimage for rock fans from across the world, who travel there in the hopes of looking around. However Scott Roe, 42, the owner of the house, says he is fed up with metal enthusiasts disturbing their peace and quiet. Mr Roe says one fan turned up having walked there from Germany, eating berries and sleeping in bushes as he went, while another stole the sign from outside his home after he refused to let him in. Stairway to Heaven has consistently ranked among the greatest rock song of all time in magazine polls, and in the US alone it is estimated it had been played 2,874,000 times on radio, enough to last for 44 years if run back-to-back. It is perhaps not surprising then that Jimmy Page once called an Oregon radio station during a charity drive and offered to donate $10,000 if they promised never to play the track again. The song was also reportedly banned from some guitar shops after staff became sick of hearing people constantly playing it while trying out instruments.The ban was even referenced in 1992 film Wayne's World. In 1982 the song fell foul of the backward masking 'scandal', as American TV stations alleged the song contained hidden satanic messages that could only be heard if it was played backwards. Among the messages said to be hidden in Stairway To Heaven were 'Here's to my sweet Satan' and 'I sing because I live with Satan', which could allegedly be heard if the lyrics 'If there's a bustle in your hedgerow, don't be alarmed now...' were reversed. According to Upstart, the song has earned an estimated $562million for the band and their record label to date, taking into account sales, royalties and downloads. However Zeppelin have repeatedly refused to licence the song for advertising meaning the record could be worth far more than that figure. Advertising experts told Upstart that, for just one campaign, Zeppelin could make around $8million, bringing the song's worth up to $570million.","Led Zeppelin to release unheard version of hit track Stairway to Heaven .

"She and Prince Harry may have parted ways, but Cressida Bonas is certainly making the point that  she hasn't severed ties with his famous family. And mirroring Kate Middleton's Middleton reaction when her and Prince William briefly separated, Cressida is also making sure she is seen out enjoying the London nightlife, and looking sensational while doing it. The 25-year-old was seen strolling hand-in-hand with the Prince Harry's cousin Beatrice as they enjoyed an evening out at Annabel's in London. Scroll down for video . As close as ever: Cressida Bonas was seen strolling hand-in-hand with Prince Harry's cousin Beatrice last night as the pair made their way towards Annabel's in London . High spirits: The aspiring model, who split from the fourth in line to the throne three weeks ago, appeared to be in good spirits as she clung tightly to her friend's hand . The pair, who were also joined by . Princess Eugenie and Beatrice's long-time boyfriend David Clark, sported . bight smiles and appeared deep in conversation as they made their way . towards the exclusive establishment. Cressida slipped into a slinky midnight blue gown by Stella McCartney with an elegant halter neckline and floor-sweeping hem for the occasion. Showcasing her willowy figure in the form-fitting frock, the model appeared in high spirits and didn't leave the upmarket club until 3am. She left her golden tresses loose to cascade in voluminous curls around her shoulders and opted for a natural beauty look, kept her make-up understated and simple. Beatrice was just as glamorous in a billowy blue skirt which she teamed with a ruched blouse. Clutching a violet, jewel embellished purse, she accessorised with a statement bracelet and chunky gold necklace. Close friends: Beatrice's sister Eugenie is also a good friend of the pretty blonde and introduced her to her cousin Prince Harry . Stella McCartney blue dress . WOW! Is Prince Harry mental?

Doing well: It was a very different look for Cressida who was last seen looking thin and rather pale while out in London's Notting Hill earlier this month . Stunning: The model slipped into a slinky midnight blue gown with an elegant halter neckline and floor-sweeping hem for the evening out . Dressed up: Beatrice cut a glamorous figure in a billowing blue skirt which she teamed with a simple blouse and statement bracelet . Tidy: Cressida swept her long golden locks into a casual bun to reveal her elegant drop earrings as she made her way out of the establishment . The Princess completed her evening outfit with a pair of pointed toe stiletto heels that featured a strap detail across her foot and ankle. Beatrice's sister Eugenie was the first to introduce Cressida to their cousin with the pair dating for two years before they split three weeks ago. The news came just one month after they attended their first official engagement together with some reports suggesting the blonde had become too 'clingy'. The aspiring actress cut a pale and thin figure when she was last seen walking through London's Notting Hill at the beginning of the month, but now seems to be changing her strategy, adopting the one successfully used by the now Duchess of Cambridge when Prince William called time on their romance for a brief period in March 2007. Kate said ‘yes’ to a slew of invitations and, in public at least, appeared more vibrant and sociable than she had been for some time. She was soon joined in London by her sister Pippa, who had just finished university and moved into Kate’s Chelsea flat. Spray-tanned and blow-dried, the two appeared together at a series of upmarket social events. Kate was still only 25, a single girl with the world at her feet – and a taxi waiting outside. Although she was heartbroken, she wasn’t going to show it. William, meanwhile, spent the summer at his barracks, fulfilling Royal duties, playing polo and enjoying a few - rather raucous - nights out with friends. It wasn't long before Kate's plan worked and the two secretly got back together on June 9, when she attended a party at his barracks to celebrate the end of training. Hand-in-hand: Princess Eugenie and her boyfriend of three-years Jack Brooksbank were seen walking towards the upmarket Mayfair establishment together . Glamorous night out: Princess Eugenie was elegant in a deep purple shift dress in a similar style to Cressida's floor-length gown . Late night: The group left the nightclub at 3am . Handsome: Beatrice's boyfriend David Clark looked dapper in crisp white shirt and bow tie as he wrapped his arm around the Princess later in the night . Fancy footwear: David completed his outfit with a pair of embossed slippers from Oliver Brown . Gentleman: David had walked a little way ahead, leaving the girls to chat in private . While Cressida now seems to be copying Kate, and ensuring she is seen out with Harry's nearest and dearest, the separation has obviously been tough on her. Meanwhile her erstwhile beau appears to have been having the time of his life recently as he attended his best friend Guy Pelly wedding to American socialite, Lizzy Wilson in Memphis. The Prince, who was seen 'twerking' on the dance floor, was having such a good time at the 'unbelievably wild' party that he made the band play five encores as he kept the party going beyond the 1am finish time. Cressida was originally expected to attend the wedding alongside the Princes, but it is thought she and Harry separated after arguing about the trip. The model was spotted the week before pacing the streets outside the office in the West End where she has a job in marketing, biting her nails and with tears in her eyes. She has also reportedly been given compassionate leave from work to consider her future and has cut an increasingly wan figure as the separation continues. Split: Prince Harry and Cressida dated for two years before splitting three weeks ago. They were pictured here watching a rugby union match between England and Wales in March . Big night?

The couple were spotted at LAX as they made their way to New York on Saturday ahead of Monday's Met Gala, although their 10-month-old daughter North wasn't seen with them and neither Kim nor Kanye were sporting wedding rings. Rumours have been swirling in recent weeks that due to a hiccup regarding French law - which requires couples to live in the country for 40 days prior to marrying - the pair would marry in private in a civil ceremony in the States ahead of their extravagant ceremony and reception in Paris later this month. However, it seems that so intimate were . their nuptials that they managed to get away with keepingthe wedding a . secret... until now. Mission . accomplished!

The MailOnline reached out to Kim's rep but received a 'no comment'. Meanhwile Kim appears to have well and truly shed those last stubborn 5lbs she was eager to ditch before her wedding. The 33-year-old was all class in her stylish, business-like ensemble, which perfectly accentuated her enviable figure. She opted for black dress pants that clung tightly to her trim thighs and flared out from the knees down, mostly obscuring her pointy black stilettos. She added a sexy, risqué factor in the form of her skin-coloured top, which, from a distance, made it appear as if she wasn't wearing anything at all. Completing her dressy look was a black boyfriend-style blazer that fell just below her ample derrière, featuring satin lapels and pointed padded shoulders. Va-va-voom!

A . year after her disastrous debut appearance at the exclusive fashion . event, when the then-heavily pregnant star was widely criticised for her . all-encompassing Ricardo Tisci floral gown, Kim has a lot to prove . second time around and is no doubt feeling the pressure to impress. Despite . her dressed-up appearance for her flight, the star wore not a lick of . make-up on her face, on which she sported a fresh golden fake tan. Lip service: Kim's plump pout, which appeared to have been kept bare except for some questionable lip liner, sparked speculation that she had had some pre-wedding fillers . You can't teach an old dog new tricks! The 36-year-old has quite the reputation for being glum and it seemed that Saturday's excursion was no different despite the couple being on the final countdown for their wedding .

Hardly the picture of happiness: With their civil ceremony reportedly taking place this week ahead of their lavish Parisian celebration on May 24, you would think the couple would look happier . Not ready for her close-up? The reality star kept her large dark shades on even inside the building, covering her make-up-free complexion, which was glowing thanks to a freshly applied fake tan . Gearing up for Kim's arrival? On the same day, Vogue editor Anna Wintour was spotted out in NYC also preparing for the MET Gala . The rapper donned several layered necklaces and carried a dark brown woven leather tote as he made his way into the airport.

"Rory McIlroy's father Gerry stands to collect £50,000 now his superstar son has won the British Open Championship - and three friends of his will also each collect £50,000 for the win they predicted 10 years ago. And there will be a lot of other happy punters today now McIlroy has sealed the deal - including another two family friends from Holywood who are believed to be in line for £40,000 each on a Rory win. Ten years ago, Gerry McIlroy placed a £100 bet at odds of 500/1 that his son would win the Open Championship's Claret Jug by the age of 25. Scroll down for video . Great team: Rory McIlroy  with his father and playing partner Gerry McIlroy during the final practice round of The Alfred Dunhill Links Championship in 2009 . Rory McIlroy is in pole position to win The Open Championship after moving six shots clear at Hoylake . The bet was placed with remarkable prescience in 2004, when McIlroy was a 15-year-old prodigy. Three friends of McIlroy's father also bet £100 each (£100 was the most that the bookie's would allow). A third Major victory at the age of 25 means McIlroy is now one of the all-time greats - as has completed three of four legs of a career grand slam, achieved only six times before in history. Rory McIlroy kisses the Claret Jug trophy after winning the British Open Golf championship . Despite some confusion yesterday over the terms of his father's bet, it was confirmed by McIlroy's agent that the bet is for Rory McIlroy to win the Open by the age of 25, meaning before he turns 26. He is 25 this year, having passed the milestone on May 4. McIlroy's agent said the bet was valid this year. 'This is the last year of the bet, so if Rory wins, Gerry wins,' he said at the time. Andrew Cotter of the BBC also tweeted yesterday that he spoke to Gerry, who confirmed that the bet still stood. Mr Cotter wrote: 'It was by the age of 25. So I asked the man himself. This year still counts.' Gerry worked 100 hours a week and his wife Rosie did night shifts at a factory in their home of Holywood in County Down to save to send Rory to U.S. competitions as a junior. When talk of the bet first emerged, Gerry was quoted as saying: 'It's ridiculous really, isn't it? You realise you can make more money on the golf tour in one week than some people make in a lifetime.' When McIlroy won his first major championship, the U.S. Open, by a record margin in 2011, his father spoke about the bet. He said: 'That was all the bookies would let us put on, £100 apiece. But that bet is looking better and better.'

It will not be the first time a fan of McIlroy has profited from his feats. One member of Holywood Golf Club had more reason than most to celebrate after his 2011 U.S. Open victory at Congressional. He landed a small fortune, believed to be around £25,000, on a bet placed when McIlroy was a promising youngster. It is understood the shrewd punter at McIlroy's home town club got odds of 500/1 when he put £50 on the teen prodigy to win a Major before age 25. As it happened, McIlroy won his first Major at the age of 22. After one of McIlroy's lap-the-field performances in the 2011 U.S. Open, another Irish great, Padraig Harrington, said: 'Rory has been lapping the field. 'There might be people capable of winning a Major, but there are not many people capable of dominating and running away from the field in a Major.' McIlroy's victory today sees him join Jack Nicklaus and Tiger Woods as the only players to win three majors by the age of 25. Meanwhile, model Nadia Forde isn't there to cheer him on today, despite speculation that she might turn up. She is in Florida, where she is relaxing after her recent car crash.

"Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling may not have to pay a $320million tax bill if he is forced to sell the NBA team. Mr Sterling has owned the Clippers since 1981, but has now been banned from the NBA for life after a recording of him ranting at his girlfriend for associating with black people came to light. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is now seeking to force Mr Sterling to sell the team, which has been valued at up to $1billion. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, pictured, could avoid a multi-million dollar tax bill if forced to sell the team . A sale would then force the property tycoon to pay $323million in tax he would owe from a sale. However, if Mr Sterling, the longest owner in the league, is forced to sell the Clippers, he could invoke Section 1033 of the U.S. tax code, which calls for special provision for anyone who has 'involuntarily converted' assets. It is thought this is usually cited by people who lose property to natural disasters or under eminent domain. The New York Post reported that to escape without a multi-million dollar tax bill, Mr Sterling would then have to re-invest the proceeds from the sale in a 'like-kind' venture, such as another sports team or entertainment venue, within two years. Tax lawyer Bradley Marsh, chairman of taxation section of the California Bar told the newspaper: 'Because the NBA and Clippers saga has not yet played out, it is premature to decide whether this treatment would apply. 'I certainly wouldn't rule it out, though.' It is not clear if he plans to sell the team, which would bring an end to his 33-year reign as owner.

Donald Sterling's estranged wife and team co-owner Rochelle Sterling (right) appeared to welcome the move to ban her ex-husband from the NBA . The league is currently working with team management to appoint an interim chief executive officer to guide the franchise through what is expected to be a difficult transition for life after Mr Sterling. The move to ban the owner was announced just hours before the Clippers beat the Warriors in Game 7 of their playoff series on Saturday night at the Staples Center. ‘The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization,’ NBA executive vice president of communications Mike Bass said. Those involved have already begun the search for the interim executive, he added. Mr Sterling’s estranged wife and team co-owner Rochelle Sterling appeared to welcome the move, and pledged to work with whoever is involved. ‘I spoke with Commissioner Adam Silver this week to tell him that I fully supported his recent swift and decisive action. ‘We also agreed at that time that, as a next step, both the league and the team should work together to find some fresh, accomplished executive leadership for the Clippers,’ she continued. ‘I welcome his active involvement in the search for a person of the utmost character, proven excellence and a commitment to promoting equality and inclusiveness.’ Clippers coach Doc Rivers speaks with his players during Saturday's Game 7.

"More than 1.7 million people have signed a Change.org petition demanding that an investigation into the judging decisions in Thursday night's women's figure skating competition be opened.

"When Manchester United’s traumatic campaign under David Moyes shuddered to its lowest depths last season, there was a theory circulating that the on-field turmoil may have very serious ramifications for the club’s off-field credentials. There was certainly some substance to this suggestion. The sliding share prices - from just under 19p before Sir Alex Ferguson’s retirement to hovering around 14p during the darkest moments of Moyes’ reign in February this year - demonstrated concrete proof of that. Without Ferguson holding the reins of power at Old Trafford, questions were asked. He was the club’s most reliable asset, a guarantee of glory. Investors lost confidence. Some season ticket holders will have privately pondered whether the yearly investment was still worth the trouble. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester United unveil their new kit with Chevrolet . Final showing: Nike's ties with Manchester United will end after the coming season . Taking the reins: Louis van Gaal is to get to work with United this week ahead of the new season . The football was dire and the results were unacceptable. In six games against Manchester City, Liverpool and Everton, United’s aggregate score was 1-14. There would be no Champions League football for at least one year. So how can it be, just two months after the curtain came down on United’s worst league finish in 24 years that the club were able to announce an extraordinary, record-breaking £750million decade-long kit deal with adidas? The figures are truly remarkable. This agreement more than doubles the £31m that Real Madrid, the previous biggest recipient, are thought to receive a year from the German firm. The £75m per year that United will receive from adidas alone is only narrowly less than the £76m turnover that Sunderland posted in 2012-13 season. In the same year, Aston Villa recorded £83.7m turnover. It offers some idea of the now obscene financial might of Manchester United. This, of course, only takes into account United’s deal with adidas. United will also receive £51m annually from shirt sponsors Chevrolet for the next seven years as well as a £17m windfall per year from AON, who have purchased the rights to plaster their name across the club’s training kit, while they also sponsor the Carrington training ground. Only on Wednesday did United announce yet another sponsorship, this time with international food brand Nissin. Boost: United have already splurged cash on midfielder Ander Herrera (left) and Southampton's Luke Shaw . On and on: Sir Alex Ferguson was always a guaranteed deliverer of success as manager at Old Trafford . How much? AON pay £17m-a-year to sponsor the Carrington complex and the club's training kit . These three principal sponsorship deals will combine to provide United with an annual income in excess of £140m, dwarfing the turnover of 14 Premier League clubs. Perversely, it would seem that United’s dismal dalliance with Moyes has, if anything, only amplified the intrigue and lure that surrounds this famous football club. Last week, United launched ‘REUNITED’, essentially a glorified corporate event for the friendly match against Valencia in August that will mark Louis van Gaal’s first match at Old Trafford. This is emblematic of the brand that United are now trying to promote. A club clawing its way back to the peak of the mountain, ambitious and determined to return to the pinnacle of the sport in a brave, new era under Van Gaal. It only underlines just how important the decision to part with Moyes had become. It was not taken lightly but it was incredibly necessary. A wave of optimism, boosted by the performance of Van Gaal at the World Cup and arrivals of Luke Shaw and Ander Herrera, is now sweeping through Old Trafford. Looking bleak: The financials behind the club were on the slide with David Moyes in charge last season . United wore their poker faces and played a high-stakes game of negotiating to secure this landmark deal, holding lengthy discussions with Nike, Puma and Uniqlo - a Japanese firm - before eventually agreeing the contract with adidas. United may still come to an arrangement with Uniqlo in the coming year, further maximising their revenue potential and expanding the brand in the Far East. Even despite concerns surrounding the team’s performances, Ed Woodward had the gumption to allow the Nike deal to run down and the increasing variety of brands on show at the club’s Carrington training ground was seen by the company as a hostile act. Now, of course, he can reflect with pride. But what if? What if Moyes had been kept on? Would adidas have risked so much if Moyes had remained in charge? We may never know but nobody can deny the spectre of doom that had engulfed Old Trafford in those final, tortuous months of last season. Perception is everything in the modern world of business and companies want to be associated with clubs that evoke confidence and self-belief. Manchester United under Van Gaal has the look of a force to be reckoned with, before a ball has even be kicked. Decent move: Chief executive Ed Woodward let Nike's deal to run down in favour of a more lucrative contract . Woodward is the brains behind the commercial operation at Old Trafford, the man who, along with Richard Arnold, has worked hard to service the club’s debt by extending United’s reach to Thai beer, Indian tyres, American watches and Japanese paint, to mention four of the 28 sponsors listed on the club’s website. The majority of these are worth around £2m to United but it all adds up a remarkable annual income. Woodward, an Essex boy, is tremendously close to the Glazer family, speaking almost daily with Joel Glazer and he was one of those investment bankers - working for JP Morgan at the time - that pushed through the takeover in 2005. The Glazers will feel that their prodigy is now proving his worth in the big job at United, despite the teething issues that he suffered last summer after taking over from David Gill. Football should never be judged by the spreadsheet but if the on-field showings can mirror the rosy picture now adorning Woodward’s financial charts, then Manchester United supporters may be in for a very exciting season indeed.

"As a sombre Manchester United party flew home from Greece on Wednesday lunchtime, the hope among those who matter was that Tuesday’s Champions League humbling at Olympiacos would prove to be as bad as it will get. If David Moyes is still to be around to spearhead a £100million-plus Old Trafford revolution this summer, he must hope they are right. Football surprises you, whoever you are. Last season, for example, United officials thought Sir Alex Ferguson had a team good enough to finish third in the Barclays Premier League. That team won it by 11 points. Not used to this: Manchester United will be hoping Tuesday's defeat to Olympiacos will be as bad as it will get . Back then: Former boss Sir Alex Ferguson lifts the title after winning the Premier League by 11 points in 2013 . Crestfallen: David Moyes (centre) slumps back into his seat following Olympiacos' second on Tuesday night . Conversely, this time around nobody at England’s biggest football club expected this. A season of transition . spent in the shadow of improving forces from Manchester City and Chelsea . was always likely. No one at Old Trafford predicted the campaign would . stand on the brink of competitive extinction by the end of February. At United, only the Glazer family know if they are harbouring any doubts over Moyes’ suitability for his role as manager. As ever, media access lines to the club’s American owners remain closed. However, around the fringes of the United machine - among those a little closer to the action - there is a growing concern not just that things are not right under Moyes but that they are getting worse. Certainly Tuesday night’s humbling at the Georgios Karaiskakis Stadium in Athens has hardened this anxiety. Much to think about: Moyes and his players must overturn a 2-0 deficit when Olympiacos visit Old Trafford . United chief executive Ed Woodward remains supportive of Moyes. He does not believe the club erred in appointing him or in handing him a six-year contract. Backing: United chief executive Ed Woodward is supportive of Moyes . What happens over the next few months, however, will have an enormous impact on the health and prosperity of this football club for years to come. As such, it would appear that a very big call indeed will have to be made between now and the season’s end. United plan to invest significantly in new players this summer. Although they are aware that a huge turnover of players in and out could be unsettling, they are prepared to do whatever is necessary in the transfer market not just to propel the team into the top four but also to win back the Barclays Premier League title. That is the stated aim. Much of this work will be done before the summer World Cup. Preparing to do business in Spain and Germany, United are ready to follow traditional trends in those countries that generally dictate players are bought and sold early in the off-season. Therefore, if the problems under Moyes continue then Woodward, his predecessor David Gill, Ferguson and the Glazers will face an enormous decision. Do they allow Moyes to spearhead this ambitious, carefully planned revolution? Do they gamble on the hope that his team will make the necessary steps  forward once they are populated by his own players? Or do they simply tear up the six-year blueprint recommended last summer by Ferguson and start the whole thing again under someone new? Stick or twist: Manchester United will have to decide whether to stick with Sir Alex Ferguson's six-year blueprint . Prior to Tuesday’s capitulation in Greece, Moyes’ position was not being discussed by the United board and one awful result during a poor season should not be allowed to change everything. However, this week’s performance was watched with horror by the United contingent in the directors’ box. The lack of pattern and apparent method was noted. Much more of this and the sands will start to shift significantly beneath the  manager’s feet. United have a weekend off now - perhaps just as well given that they were due to face Capital One Cup finalists Manchester City in  the league. In 10 days, however, Moyes and his . players go to West Bromwich Albion to start a run of games tough enough . to edge United further towards Premier League no-man’s land if . improvement isn’t immediately apparent. Within the Moyes camp, there is no bullishness. The United manager and his staff saw signs on Tuesday that their messages are not getting through to many of the players. That has obviously worried them. Moyes, for example, talked up the partnership between Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie on Monday but it is a union only in name. During Tuesday’s game they exchanged passes only five times while United goalkeeper David de Gea received the ball from a team-mate on 20 occasions, once more than Van Persie. Bad night at the office: Wayne Rooney (left) and Robin van Persie exchanged just five passes on Tuesday . If he is retained beyond the season - and it remains most likely that he will be - Moyes has his plans mapped out. He and Woodward know which players they wish to buy and which they wish to move on. It will be a remarkable summer - almost unprecedented - at Old Trafford from that point of view. The lessons of last summer have been learned. Talk to people at United and they will admit that Woodward and Moyes were relatively unprepared for what they needed to do when Ferguson stood down and also that they chased players like Barcelona’s Cesc Fabregas for far too long. Long pursuit: United wasted far too much time trying to sign Barcelona's Cesc Fabregas (left) last summer . This time, Moyes is aware that he needs to be sharper, more decisive, when it comes to players. He cannot dawdle at the finish line as he did over Barcelona midfielder Thiago Alcantara. As somebody who knows Moyes has pointed out, his thoroughness, while usually an advantage, can sometimes prove a hindrance. To this end, shrewd alterations have already been made at United’s Carrington training base. The rather archaic scouting system left behind by Ferguson has been expanded, refined and bolstered by technology and new staff. Moyes has brought in Robbie Cooke, his former chief scout at Everton, and John Murtough, from the Premier League, as Head of Elite Performance. United’s database of players is already much deeper than it was a year ago. Missed out: United targeted Thiago Alcanatara last summer but the Spain international joined Bayern Munich . Woodward is also doing his bit to move United forward on other levels. He seems to be growing into his role. In football, though, results will always define you and United know they need to have the right man pressing the buttons on their fancy new machines. As strange as it sounds, Moyes actually has more to prove now than he did when he succeeded Ferguson last summer. He, like any manager, will only be given so much time.","Fear around Old Trafford things may be getting worse under David Moyes .

"NBA officials have taken the next step in scrubbing the stain left by Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling’s racist ranting. The league is working with team management to appoint an interim chief executive officer to guide the franchise through what is expected to be a difficult transition after Sterling was banned for life earlier this week by commissioner Adam Silver. The move was announced just hours before the Clippers beat the Warriors in Game 7 of their playoff series Saturday night at the Staples Center. Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling, pictured, could avoid a multi-million dollar tax bill if forced to sell the team . ‘The best way to ensure the stability of the team during this difficult situation is to move quickly and install a CEO to oversee the Clippers organization,’ NBA executive vice president of communications Mike Bass said in a statement.

With a friend: Rochelle Sterling was seen close to this man most of the night, and also said she supports the league's moves to oust her disgraced husband from the team . Any sake of the Clippers would require a vote of approval from at least three-fourths of team owners.The NBA's 10-member finance/advisory committee agreed during a Thursday conference call to oust the toxic owner. No time frame has been agreed upon for how long they believe it should take to find a new owner, and the team itself is not exactly sure how the process will play out, sources told the Los Angeles Daily News. It is not clear if Sterling plans to fight plans to sell the team in court that would bring an end to his 33-year reign as owner. He is the longest-tenured team owner in the league. Clippers coach Doc Rivers deferred to league executives when before Saturday’s big game whether the timing of the announcement would affect his team. ‘We've got to talk about everything else, so let's talk about that, too,’ said Rivers. ‘The NBA has to do their job, they really do.

"Iker Casillas wants Real Madrid to tear up his contract so he can join Arsenal on a free transfer, according to reports in Spain. The Spain keeper is an institution at the Bernabeu but lost his No 1 spot to Diego Lopez two seasons ago and now only starts for Real in the Champions League.

But were he to leave Arsenal, several clubs would . be interested. Emotional: Wenger managed Monaco from 1987 to 1994 and reached Champions League semi-finals . Meanwhile, Lukas Podolski will seek talks with Wenger . after the FA Cup final as he considers his future. The Germany striker . has cut a frustrated figure, spending plenty of time warming the bench. An . early-season hamstring injury that kept him out for four months hasn’t . helped, nevertheless  Podolski’s lack of action is a major issue for the . forward. The former Cologne star has been back in Wenger’s plans in . recent weeks, making five starts in succession and scoring four goals in . the process. Doubts: Arsenal striker Lukas Podolski will seek assurances from Wenger about his future . But Podolski fears he will be back on the bench next . season, particularly when Theo Walcott returns from injury. The . 28-year-old will seek clarification before the World Cup regarding .

"From the moment Yorkshire was named as the venue for the Grand Depart of this year’s Tour de France, the script has had Mark Cavendish raising his arms in victory in Harrogate on Saturday. A win would see him pull on the Tour leader’s yellow jersey for the first time in his career — and in his mother, Adele’s, home town, too. ‘It’s incredible that for the second time in my career the UK’s got the Grand Depart of the Tour de France,’ said Cavendish on Thursday.

It’s like something I’ve never seen. ‘People who rode the Tour de France when it started in London in 2007 still talk about it but I think Yorkshire’s going to out-do that. I think everybody here still doesn’t really anticipate how big it’s going to be. ‘It’s exciting. The Tour doesn’t begin and end in Yorkshire. It’s 21 days, I have a very strong Omega  Pharma-QuickStep team and we want to be successful over the whole Tour.’ In the absence of Sir Bradley Wiggins, David Millar and Alex Dowsett — all Grand Tour stage winners in the last two years — Cavendish is one of only four Brits in the field.

And while he sought to play down the importance of the day, knowing that crashes or his main rival, Marcel Kittel, could come between him and victory, Cavendish admitted: ‘It would be nice to wear yellow.

"Manchester United made a late swoop to bring in Radamel Falcao on loan from Monaco just before the transfer window slammed shut. The former Atletico Madrid striker will give Louis van Gaal another impressive attacking option, but can he find a way to play him alongside star men Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie? We asked out three wise men - Jamie Carragher, Martin Keown and Jamie Redknapp - where Falcao will fit in this season. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Cristiano Ronaldo discuss Manchester United summer signings . Settling in: Radamel Falcao shows off his colours after arriving at Manchester United on a season-long loan . JAMIE REDKNAPP: He's one of the best No 9s I've ever seen. His movement and ability to hold up the ball is phenomenal. Anyone who can keep Diego Costa out of the Atletico Madrid team must be special. As long as he's fit after his cruciate-ligament injury, he will rip this league apart. He's athletic, has spring and can finish with subtlety or smash the ball into the top corner. Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney might not be happy — Falcao's United's No 1 now. If Van Gaal plays 3-5-2, there will be so many unhappy players: where do Mata and Januzaj fit in? One thing is for sure — they have to get into the top four now they've spent all that money. No 1: Sportsmail columnist Jamie Redknapp believes Falcao will be first choice striker under Louis van Gaal . Options: Manchester United manager Van Gaal could play Wayne Rooney wide or behind his front two . Versatile: Rooney, pictured in action against Burnley, looks likely to move from his role as a central striker . JAMIE CARRAGHER: We used to love small strikers like Robbie Fowler or Michael Owen, but now it is all about the men who can lead the line on their own. Falcao is one of them, a forward with real presence who will score goals. Ever since his superb performance for Atletico Madrid against Chelsea in the Super Cup two seasons ago, I thought he would move to one of Europe's giants. It was a waste playing in the French league because a player of that quality needs to be somewhere better. I can see Wayne Rooney dropping back and taking Juan Mata's place in behind Falcao and Robin van Persie. But it will be tough for United to rotate players and give everyone game time as they have no European games or even the Capital One Cup. Not that Louis van Gaal will be afraid to drop people. Battle: Juan Mata (right) faces a fight to retain his place in behind United's two-man strike force . Rotation: Robin van Persie could find himself out wide in a 4-2-3-1 or on the bench in Van Gaal goes 3-5-2 . Fighting fit: Van Persie insists he is ready to lead the line for his former Holland boss Van Gaal . MARTIN KEOWN: He attacks things in the box and loves getting across the face of defenders. He's brave too. Maybe we'll now see United put more crosses into the box for their out-and-out No 9. Van Persie takes the corners and free-kicks, Falcao attacks them. He made his league debut at 13 and has been banging in goals ever since - he's a natural born finisher. Mata will miss out. You could play Falcao up top and a three behind of Di Maria, Van Persie and Rooney with Blind and Herrera sitting deep when everyone is fit. Like our dedicated Manchester United Facebook page.

"Formula One supremo Bernie Ecclestone will discover later on Tuesday whether a settlement offer to end his bribery trial has been accepted. The 83-year-old has proposed a staggering sum of 100 million dollars (£60million) to bring an end to a case that commenced in April in a district court in Munich. That figure has been accepted by the state prosecutors, and is now being considered by the presiding judge Peter Noll. Deal on table: Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone arrives with his wife Fabiana Flosi (seated left) for his trial in Munich, where prosecutors have offered to drop bribery charges against him in exchange for £60million . In Germany, certain criminal trials can be concluded if all parties agree to a settlement. In Ecclestone's case, the prosecutors have accepted a proposed £60million, and it is now left to presiding judge Peter Noli. Such an arrangement does not imply any guilt on behalf of the accused. Ecclestone said: 'We don't know anything yet. 'The judge is going to come out at one o'clock. They haven't made up their mind what they want to do, to be honest with you. 'It's going to take them a few hours to look at this and decide what they want to do, so we wait and see.' Over the past few months Ecclestone has been defending himself against charges of bribery of a German banker, and incitement to breach of trust. In 2006, German regional bank BayernLB sold their 47.2 per cent stake in F1 to private equity firm, and the current majority shareholders, CVC Capital Partners. Prosecutors claim Ecclestone paid Gerhard Gribkowsky, formerly the chief risk officer of BayernLB, a bribe of 44million US dollars (£26million) to steer the sale to CVC. Deliberations: Formula One boss Bernie Ecclestone talks to his lawyer Sven Thomas in the Munich courtroom . VIDEO Ecclestone comes face-to-face with accuser . Ecclestone has long maintained his innocence, claiming he was 'shaken down' by Gribkowsky who was threatening to inform HM Revenue & Customs he controlled an offshore family trust known as Bambino Holdings. Although Ecclestone has continually insisted the trust is not in his name, if an investigation had uncovered to the contrary he would have been liable for a tax bill of around £2billion. With the trial running for just over three months, last Tuesday it was halted after Ecclestone offered to pay a sum of money, believed at that stage to be 25million euros (£20million) in return for the charges being dropped. Under Bavarian state law, a trial of the nature of Ecclestone's can be concluded if the accused makes a payment to a non-profit making organisation, or the treasury. Presiding over the case: Judge Peter Noll (centre) arrives for another session of the trial of the F1 boss . Such an offer, however, does not imply any guilt on behalf of the accused. Ecclestone's lawyers made the offer believing the state prosecution team's case to be, in their words, 'highly questionable', and with the trial proving to be 'extremely burdensome' on their client. Over the past few days negotiations have swayed back and forth, and understood to have resulted in the 100million euro offer. Ecclestone has continued to run F1 either side of attending court for two days a week, which would have concluded in October had it run its full course. His future as head of F1 hinged on the outcome of the trial as he had previously been warned a guilty verdict, regardless of whether he avoided a prison sentence, would have resulted in his dismissal as chief executive.

"Manchester City head into a last-day title decider, with their opponents aiming for one last twist in a remarkable Premier League season. City manager Manuel Pellegrini insists his players will not buckle as they face West Ham at home knowing one point will clinch the title at the expense of Liverpool. Pellegrini said: ‘I expect to win. We are thinking not of winning one point but of winning the match, and the best way to do it is to play the way we always do. Knew it all along: Manuel Pellegrini expects Man City to beat Liverpool to the title with a win against West Ham . Blues brothers: Manchester City are on the brink of winning their second league title in three years . ‘I am not complacent because I talk with the players every day about what we must do. They are good players with lots of  experience and they agree we must not change anything and try to win the game.’ But West Ham manager Sam Allardyce is determined to spoil City’s title party if only to fulfil his wish to see Liverpool skipper Steven Gerrard win his first Premier League title. King maker: Sam Allardyce could produce one final twist if his West Ham side beat City at the Etihad . Red leader: Allardyce would like to win to fulfil his wish of seeing Steven Gerrard lift the trophy . Allardyce said: ‘From a neutral’s point of view, everybody would like to see Liverpool win it. From a personal point of view I’d like to see Steven Gerrard win it. 'City’s goal record is fantastic and they’ve got great players. But every West Ham player can give his best because we know we’re safe in the Premier League, so let’s go and spoil City’s party.’ City’s hopes have been further boosted by striker Sergio Aguero’s recovery from a groin injury.Nevertheless, Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers, whose side are at home to Newcastle, is determined to fight to the finish. He said: ‘The expectancy is that Manchester City will win. But West Ham will want to finish on a high. Come Sunday, we will fight to the very end. Raise a glass: Brendan Rodgers has praised Liverpool's season even if they do finish second to big-spending City . ‘To come second to the richest team in the history of sport is an incredible achievement.’ Win or lose, Rodgers is targeting up to five quality additions to his squad. Liverpool did not sign anyone in January but they have identified a number of targets, including Adam Lallana of Southampton and Cardiff defender Steven Caulker. Rodgers said: ‘The work has been going on for a little while now, especially since we consolidated a place in the Champions League. ‘I think we’re a really attractive proposition to players through Europe. ‘We are right on the football map.’ Incoming?

"A free-kick in an attacking position should be a goalscoring opportunity but defenders reduce the risk by encroaching. As soon as the ref turns his back they look to gain two yards.

"Arjen Robben seems to be the player most renowned for having perfected the art of diving, and the Holland forward revealed he was up to his old tricks on Sunday. The Dutchman admitted trying to con referee Pedro Proenca in Holland's 2-1 win over Mexico, leading manager Miguel Herrera to brand the 30-year-old a 'cheat'. Robben apologised for his first-half dive but says his 93rd-minute penalty was genuine, which Klaas-Jan Huntelaar coolly slotted home to book a place in the quarter-final. So, where does Robben rank? Here, Sportsmail pick 10 other ultimate divers. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Arjen Robben's alleged dive that earned Holland a penalty . Tumble: Robben goes over and the Portuguese referee awards a penalty deep into injury time . Ashley Young . When a dive goes viral and inspires mock-up videos, you know it's bad. And Ashley Young is no stranger to that exact experience. The Manchester United winger's theatrical dives against Real Sociedad, Aston Villa and QPR - to name a few - involved minimal contact, but were enough to send Young sprawling to the ground. Young, with online compilation videos at the ready, has been criticised by former United players, including Roy Keane, and has earned an unfortunate reputation. But the 28-year-old remains unapologetic, saying it's up to the referees to make the right call. Flying: Ashley Young goes down against Aston Villa to win a penalty against Ciaran Clark at Old Trafford . Clip? Young feels the touch against Real Sociedad as the ball comes to him in the box . Criticised: Young was put under the spotlight for going down easily against Real Sociedad . VIDEO Young dives into fresh controversy . Gareth Bale . The world's most expensive player was criticised for simulation before making his £85million move to Real Madrid from Tottenham, and has taken his nasty habit from the Premier League to La Liga. It is, of course, easy for defenders to bring such a pacey winger down but Bale, sitting top of the all-time list of Premier League divers, needs little invitation to do so. The Welsh forward got into a heated debate with Canal Plus reporter Ricardo Sierra after he was accused of diving against Sevilla. 'I was going at pace and to be honest I felt a touch,' said Bale. 'There was no touch,' Sierra replied. 'I felt something,' insisted Bale. 'I thought he was going to pull a leg out on me, so as usual I try and avoid the contact. But, erm, it was not a penalty and we move on.' Dive: Gareth Bale appeals for a penalty but gets little as he is judged to have gone down too easy . Serial offender: Bale was the most booked Premier League player for simulation with seven yellow cards . Luis Suarez . Luis Suarez, a player with enough black marks against his name to share, goes to ground easier than most. But the Liverpool striker's latest controversy - biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini on the shoulder to warrant a four-month and nine international game ban - even involved a spot of play-acting. Suarez, having gnawed at a player for the third time in his career after Otman Bakkal and Branislav Ivanovic, goes down clutching his face and tending to his sore tooth. It was a different type of dive, one that perhaps saved him from a red card, but Suarez remains insistent: 'I hit my face against the player leaving a small bruise on my cheek and a strong pain in my teeth.' Hurt: Luis Suarez holds his teeth and says his face simply hit against the player by accident at the World Cup . Strict: Suarez received little sympathy and was given a four-month and nine international game ban . Rivaldo . Quite the performance from Rivaldo in the 2002 World Cup gifted Brazil the edge as they saw off Turkey in the closing moments of their Group C clash. Hakan Unsal kicked the ball at Rivaldo's leg while the midfielder was waiting to take a corner deep into stoppage time, only to be sent off as the Barcelona star went down holding his face. Rivaldo was fined £5,180 and said: 'Obviously, the ball didn't hit me in the race, but I was still the victim. I did not hit anyone in the face. I was both the victim and the person who got fined. Nobody remembers what the Turk did.' Unfortunately for Rivaldo, we do. Overreacting: Rivaldo got hit in the legs by the ball but went down like he'd been smashed in the face . Nani . Nani has come under the microscope during his time at Manchester United for buying fouls, cards and penalties from Premier League referees. He did it against Newcastle and Tottenham, and was criticised by fans and pundits alike for each, saying the fast-paced winger hits the deck under the slightest of touches. But former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson came to his player's defence in 2012. 'We have known for quite a few years there are plenty of players diving and, you have to say, particularly foreign players,' said Ferguson. 'Nani is not the type to dive. He has never been that type of player. Sometimes you get them, sometimes you don't.' Easy? Nani goes down for Manchester United against Tottenham but Sir Alex Ferguson defended his player . Microscope: Nani has been criticised for diving during his time at Old Trafford with United . Sergio Busquets . An Oscar-winning performance saw Sergio Busquets play peek-a-boo on the ground during Barcelona's 1-0 win in the Champions League semi-final over 10-man Inter Milan. Busquets, feigning injury, went down as Thiago Motta raised his arm and supposedly hit his face, earning the Milan midfielder a second yellow card. It caused uproar, but Busquets thinks differently. 'Play-acting? It's not play-acting, it's being smart,' he told Cadena COPE. 'It's a debate we shouldn't be having, because that's not the real issue. It's all too easy to label people.' Nevertheless, Jose Mourinho's Inter won 3-2 on aggregate. Justice, perhaps. Sneak peek: Sergio Busquets takes a quick look to see what the referee's reaction was to his fall . Drama: Busquets caused uproar in the media after going down easily from Motta's challenge . Angry: Motta grabs Busquets after he was shown a red card in the clash between Inter Milan and Barcelona . Jurgen Klinsmann . Perhaps one of the first footballing stars to be scrutinised for diving after a theatrical tumble saw Argentina's Pedro Monzon receive red as Germany won 1-0 in the 1990 World Cup final. The now USA coach still disputes the accusations: 'If he didn't make contact with me, how come I had a 15-centimetre gash in my shin?' Klinsmann has a sense of humour, though, as he celebrated in similar fashion after scoring on his Tottenham debut at Sheffield Wednesday in 1994. Conned: Jurgen Klinsmann went aerial over Argentina's Pedro Monzon's challenge in the World Cup . Didier Drogba . Yet another case of peek-a-boo from one of the best footballers on the planet. Didier Drogba was physical, a beast and feared during his Chelsea days, but had a menacing gift that often left referees with a decision to make in the box. His most infamous, though, came near the half-way line as Napoli's Salvatore Aronica's elbow hit Drogba on the top of his arm, before the striker went down clutching his face. Drogba, taking a leaf out of Busquets' book, opens an eye through his hand to check what the referee made of his tumble. Grounded: Chelsea's Didier Drogba went down holding his face after getting an elbow on his arm . Cheeky: Drogba couldn't help but have a little look to see what action was being taken against Napoli . Down: Drogba was no stranger to hitting the deck during his legendary Chelsea days at Stamford Bridge . Morten Gamst Pedersen . Morten Gamst Pedersen's dive against Arsenal is enough to earn a place on this list alone. It was, to say the least, strange. Pedersen, a Blackburn winger at the time, runs through on goal, pursued by Bacary Sagna, before hitting the ground for no apparent reason. Then, Pedersen looks bewildered as to how he hasn't been awarded a penalty by Phil Dowd. It was because Sagna was actually a yard-and-a-half behind him as he hit the deck, and Pedersen may have in fact clipped his own heels. Not even close: Blackburn's Morten Gamst Pedersen goes down in the bow without a touch against Arsenal . Cristiano Ronaldo . Even the arguably best player on the planet has play-acting in his bag of tricks. Cristiano Ronaldo, in a hot-blooded Champions League clash with AC Milan, went down holding his face after a brush from Ignazio Abate. The delayed reaction a dead giveaway. English referee Howard Webb was having none of it, and simply waited for Ronaldo to get to his feet unharmed after an exaggerated roll around.

"Click here for your ultimate stats guide from the game - including Jack Colback's goal . Miracles do happen, and in the case of Gus Poyet, they can be made to look ridiculously easy. Exactly a month ago, after a 5-1 drubbing at Tottenham, a disconsolate Poyet surveyed his ailing side’s prospects and declared it would take a miracle for them to preserve their Barclays Premier League status and avoid the drop. Four wins on the spin, a sequence more akin to a team with designs on the title, and, suddenly, the fate Sunderland’s manager was resigned to has been averted with a game to spare.

The . cushion of a 2-0 lead came courtesy of a goal that was brilliantly . worked and clinically executed. Borini played a ball inside to Sebastian . Larsson and kept advancing towards the area, as his team-mate . controlled it and weighed up his options. Decision . made, Larsson cleverly lifted the ball over West Brom’s static . defenders and into the path of Borini, who by this time had reached the . penalty spot and faultlessly finished off a sublime move with a . first-time volley on the turn. West . Brom briefly rallied in the second half and almost reduced the arrears . when Victor Anichebe narrowly failed to convert Craig Dawson’s cross as . he slid in at the far post.

"After Luis Suarez confirmed his status as the pantomime villain of world football, Sportsmail takes a look at some of the most controversial characters that the game has produced. From the Butcher of Bilbao to the Brazilian ‘animal’, it’s a quite frightening list of misdemeanours. But who comes out as the number one pariah in football history? 10. Harald Schumacher . Arguably guilty of the worst foul in World Cup history, the West German collided with Patrick Battiston, the French defender, leaving him unconscious at the 1982 World Cup in Spain. The Frenchman also lost three teeth in the incident. Bizarrely, the referee awarded the free-kick to Germany. Shocking: Patrick Battiston (left) lost three teeth after being fouled by Harald Schumacher (right) in 1982 . 9. Eric Cantona . A misunderstood philosopher or plain nasty? Certainly, there were a couple of screws loose in the mind of this Manchester United legend, who was banned for nine months and ordered to do 120 hours of community service after launching a kung-fu kick after being verbally abused by Matthew Simmons, a Crystal Palace supporter, during a match at Selhurst Park in 1995. The Frenchman was dismissed six times in the Premier League for Manchester United, averaging a red card every 24 games. Into the stands: Eric Cantona was banned for nine months after his kung-fu kick on a Crsytal Palace fan . 8. Edmundo . The man nicknamed as ‘The Animal’ must go down as Brazil’s most controversial player. The striker was sent off an extraordinary seven times in 1997 alone and in a career littered with scuffles, feuds, manslaughter charges and a brief prison sentence, Edmundo earned a reputation as one of football’s greatest villains. His relationship at Vasco de Gama with strike partner Romario constantly hit the headlines, with the two always squabbling but forming a potent partnership, as Manchester United discovered in a 3-1 defeat in Brazil at the FIFA Club World Championship in 2000. In 1999, he came under fire from animal rights organisations after he hired a circus to perform in his back garden and served whisky and beer to a chimpanzee called Pedrinho. Feisty character: Edmundo was sent off seven times in 1997 and has spent a brief spell in prison in the past . 7. Andoni Goikoetxea . ‘The Butcher of Blibao’ scythed down a young Diego Maradona when playing for Atheltic Bilbao against Barcelona in 1983. The dreadful lunge severely damaged Maradona’s ankle and it is alleged that the Basque defender keeps the boot that committed the crime in a glass case at home and that he would wheel it out at parties to show guests. Hacked down: Andoni Goikoetxea brutally scythed down Diego Maradona during the 1983 Copa del Rey final . In agony: The brutal challenge by Goikoetxea left Maradona with a severely damaged ankle . 6. Roy Keane . A serial winner but also a serial offender, there were moments of shocking lunacy that verged on that of a sociopath. The knee-high smash into Alfe-Inge Haaland and the stamp on Gareth Southgate were startling as the red mist descended on the Irishman. The assault on Haaland was a response to an incident several years before when Haaland had stood over Keane as the United man suffered a cruciate knee ligament injury. Keane, who also left the World Cup in South Korea in 2002 after a furious showdown with manager Mick McCarthy, wrote in his autobiography:  ‘I f****** hit him hard. The ball was there (I think). Take that you c***. And don't ever stand over me sneering about fake injuries.’ Horror tackle: Roy Keane (left) was sent off for his premeditated lunge on Alfe-Inge Haaland (bottom) in 2001 . 5. Duncan Ferguson . Perhaps the most uncompromising (and frightening) centre forward that English football has seen, ‘Big Dunc’ was convicted of assault four times, the most famous being his headbutt aimed at Raith Rovers’ John McStay in 1994, for which he received a three month prison sentence. He also butted a policeman, beat up a supporter on crutches and an assault on a fisherman at a hotel. He has since reinvented himself as a pioneering coach and he is working closely with the Everton first-team under Roberto Martinez. Bang: Duncan Fergusson served a three-month prison sentence for headbutting John McStay in 1994 . 4. Joey Barton . Displaying his backside to Everton fans at Goodison Park, stubbing out a cigar in the face of Manchester City youngster Jamie Tandy and not forgetting a 74-day prison sentence for assault, Barton is Britain’s most highly-charged footballer. He also brought shame on himself in a QPR shirt when he lashed out at Carlos Tevez and Sergio Aguero, for which he was banned for 12 games. Now rehabilitated as ‘football’s philosopher king’, to quote David Dimbleby, Barton was recently invited to be a panellist on BBC’s Question Time. Bad boy: Joey Barton (right) was sent off for lashing out at Carlos Tevez (left) in 2012 . 3. Diego Maradona . The Argentine has always been one of the most divisive figures in world football. The Hand of God, that horrendous kick on an Athletico Bilbao defender and the mad gaze into a television camera at the 1994 World Cup, Maradona was always one to attract controversy. He was suspended for 15 months in 1991 following a positive test for cocaine while playing for Napoli and handed a suspended jail sentence for shooting journalists with an air rifle in 1998. Troubled time: Maradona is one of the most divisive footballers ever to grace the world stage . Bye! The Argentina captain was sent home from the 1994 World Cup after failing a drugs test for ephedrine . 2. Kevin Muscat . The former Millwall and Wolves defender was sent off 12 times in his career and was forced to come to a £250,000 agreement at the High Court with former Charlton midfielder Matthew Holmes in 2004. Holmes suffered a broken tibia after a tackle by then Wolves defender Muscat in an FA Cup game in February 1998. The no-nonsense Aussie became known for his brutal reducers and was described by Birmingham City defender Martin Grainger as ‘the most hated man in football.’ Reducer: Kevin Muscat (left) got a notorious reputation for some horror challenges during his career . Villian: Former Millwall captain Muscat was once describes as 'the most hated man in football' 1. Luis Suarez . The shoulder-munching Uruguayan has become the pantomime villain of world football, biting three players – Otman Bakkal, Branislav Ivanovic and Giorgio Chiellini – in the space of four years. Throw in the racist abuse aimed at Manchester United’s Patrice Evra (and Suarez’s subsequent refusal to shake the Frenchman’s hand) and it makes for a rather unpleasant character. Three bites and you’re out, Luis. Top dog: Luis Suarez has gained a villainous reputation in football for several offences .

The club is braced for a whopping £20million shortfall if they miss out on the Champions League for the first time in 19 years.

"History beckons for Manchester City this season. Manuel Pellegrini’s side have a glorious opportunity to become England’s first domestic Treble winners and make themselves immortal. But they are not the only club for whom greatness is possible. Arsenal could end their nine-year wait for a trophy in spectacular fashion by doing the Barclays Premier League and FA Cup Double. If they were to land both pots, it would be for a record-breaking fourth time. Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger have to remember this when they prepare for the second leg of their respective Champions League ties with Barcelona and Bayern Munich. The Champions League is an obsession for all managers but an obsession cannot cloud the big picture for City and Arsenal. Time for a rest? Manuel Pellegrini may consider giving Yaya Toure (left) a break in the second leg in Barcelona . Break time? Mesut Ozil (centre) and Per Mertesacker (right) could benefit from a rest in Arsenal's tie with Bayern . With that in mind, Pellegrini should consider not taking his key players — men such as Vincent Kompany, Sergio Aguero, Yaya Toure and Joe Hart — to the Nou Camp on March 12. Similarly, Wenger would be better served leaving his top men at home when he heads to Munich 24 hours earlier. As hard as that might be to hear, consider this: no team in the history of the Champions League have ever overturned a 2-0 home defeat away in the second leg. City had enough trouble laying a glove on Barcelona at home, so what realistic chance do they have of scoring three away? Take a look at the assignments Arsenal and City have either side of their second legs, and the argument for making changes becomes even more compelling. City face Wigan in the FA Cup at 4pm on the Sunday before travelling to Spain. After flying back in the early hours of Thursday morning, they then head to Hull for a Saturday lunchtime kick-off in the Premier League. The Manchester derby is also looming on the horizon. Arsenal’s demands are even more intense. They play Everton at home in the FA Cup quarter-final, then go to Munich before visiting Tottenham the following Sunday. After that, their next two Premier League games are away to Chelsea and a home date with... Manchester City. Everything changed in the final moments of the first legs. Had City and Arsenal been in the position of needing to overhaul a one-goal  deficit, this topic would not have  been open to debate. Pellegrini and Wenger would have gone full strength and all other competitions would have played second fiddle. The goals from Dani Alves and Thomas Muller, however, turned the situation upside down for both sides. Winning the Champions League this season can no longer be the priority, not when you have given two of the best sides in the world a two-goal start with home advantage. Anything is possible in football, but there comes a time when you have to be realistic. And it would be calamity if either side lost an influential player chasing an almost impossible cause. Leave him out? Sergio Aguero (back) is likely to be fit for City's second leg at the Nou Camp . And him? Joe Hart is likely to start in goals for Manchester City at Barcelona despite being 2-0 behind on aggregate . Main man: Lionel Messi opened the scoring from the penalty spot against City at the Etihad . Glimmer of hope? 10-man Arsenal went down thanks to a masterclass from Toni Kroos (bottom) No hope: Kroos' thunderbolt found the back of the net to hand Bayern the lead at the Emirates . Game changers: Martin Demichelis was dismissed for City (right) while Wojciech Szczesny (left) was sent off . For City to get through against Barcelona would require a performance like no other and the physical effects would be huge. I’ve played at the Nou Camp and the pitch is so big it can feel like you are  playing on your own, as your team-mates are always so far away. It is a draining, stamina-sapping experience trying to keep up with the best possession team in the business and it would be a nightmare for Pellegrini if City compromised their hopes of winning the title with a tired performance at Hull. That game has now almost become bigger than Barcelona and similar sentiments apply to the north London derby. We have reached the stage of the season where draws feel like defeats in the title race. There is no margin for error. To win the title, you need your best players available for the biggest games. Manchester City and Arsenal can maximise their chances of that by giving their main men an evening off in the middle of March. The reward could be a Treble or a Double.

Get in: Craig Bellamy celebrates as Liverpool came from behind to snatch the win in Catalonia . Stop this red-card rule from ruining our game . Two stupid mistakes ruined two brilliant Champions League games this week and turned contests we have waited all winter for into glorified training sessions. Both Martin Demichelis and Wojciech Szczesny deserved to be sent off under the present laws, regardless of what Manuel Pellegrini and Arsene Wenger believe. But the time has come for football’s governing bodies to make a rule change that will benefit the game. Referees should be given the discretion to not send off a player for a foul if he is the last man in the penalty area. It is ridiculous that teams can be punished three times — a red card, a penalty and a suspension — for one offence. Red cards given to players who are making genuine attempts to tackle frustrate me the most. It is grossly unfair that the slightest misjudgment of timing can be penalised so harshly. Bang to rights? Lionel Messi was hauled down by Demichelis, resulting in a penalty . Stonewall? Arjen Robben hits the deck in Bayern's clash with Arsenal that saw Szczesny sent off . Raging: Arsene Wenger (left) was unahppy with Robben, while Manuel Pellegrini (right) blasted the Swedish ref . There can be no complaints about a red card if you are the last man and you foul a player outside the box. In those cases, the opposing team only get a free-kick, which does not replace the goalscoring chance in the way a penalty does. If a foul is committed in the area, a penalty would be sufficient punishment. There are, of course, offences in the area that have to carry a red card. If a striker is fouled when about to put the ball into an empty net or a defender handles on the line, they have to walk because they have stopped a certain goal. But being stopped from having a goalscoring opportunity is a completely different matter. It should never be assumed that just because a forward is through on goal he is going to score. This week, I spoke to two players who have taken penalties all through their career. Both have also found themselves running through on goal countless times. They agreed that taking a penalty is easier than going through on goal. People argue that defenders would feel they could get away with heavy fouls in the area if the laws were changed to end red cards for mistimed tackles. But they are missing the point. That isn’t my argument. I’m talking about genuine attempts to get the ball. If someone tackles with excessive force, it is a red card. No question. Fair? Michel Platini (left) and Pierluigi Collina admit that some clubs are unhappy with the current red-card rule . Game over? City face a massive task to overturn the two-goal deficit at the Nou Camp next month . I met Michel Platini and Pierluigi Collina recently at UEFA’s headquarters and they said clubs are unhappy with the rule of a straight red when there is a genuine attempt to play the ball. It is an issue that must be addressed. We don’t want to see glamour fixtures ruined in the future by technicalities. I used to find training sessions when the focus was attack versus defence bad enough. Having to sit through games that turn out that way is even worse. My top-five penalty takers . Mesut Ozil showed how not to take a penalty against Bayern Munich. From the length of his run-up to the hesitation before he struck the ball, you never thought he would score. With this famous five, though, you would put your mortgage on them every time. 1 Rickie Lambert — It is assumed that Matt Le Tissier is the greatest penalty taker to play for Southampton but Lambert’s record of 32 successful kicks in a row puts him into first place. It’s an incredible record. Lethal: Rickie Lambert (centre) has a perfect record when taking penalties . 2 Matt Le Tissier — If only he had gone to a major tournament with England, maybe we wouldn’t have suffered so many shootout defeats. He never gave the goalkeeper a chance from 12 yards and his statistics of 48 out of 49 stands up to the closest scrutiny. Legend: Matt Le Tissier was another Southampton striker with an impeccable record from the spot . 3 Jan Molby — Steven Gerrard moved on to 37 successful spot-kicks for Liverpool at Arsenal last week and is closing in on Big Jan’s club record of 42 from 45. Molby scored a hat-trick of penalties in one game against Coventry. Just like that: Jan Molby rolls home a penalty for Liverpool against Queens Park Rangers . 4 Ray Stewart — His inclusion in this list is a must. The West Ham United defender had an incredible record from 12 yards, scoring 81 of his 86 attempts. Mark Noble has been impressive for the current West Ham squad but he has some way to go to match Stewart. Easy: West Ham United defender Ray Stewart managed to score 81 of 86 penalties during his career . 5 Leighton Baines — Leighton is a quiet and unassuming lad but he has nerves of steel when faced with a penalty. He’s scored 15 of the 16 he has taken for Everton and there was never any doubt he would score in the FA Cup tie against Swansea last Sunday. Deadeye: A man of many talents, Leighton Baines has also proven his class from the spot .","Both Arsenal and Manchester City could each have historic seasons .

"Luis Suarez crouched on the Selhurst Park turf, shirt pulled taut over his head after a match which probably ended Liverpool’s title challenge and the chance of an ‘absolute dream come true’ for the Uruguayan. Steven Gerrard coaxed his team-mate to his feet, waving away TV cameras honing in on his despair and Kolo Toure draped his arm around Suarez and ushered him off the pitch. These images may have prompted some mickey taking but they showed how much he is cared for by Liverpool. This is a club that stuck by him when he was a pariah of football after being found guilty of racially abusing Patrice Evra and nibbling at Branislav Ivanovic’s arm. They have supported him completely and Brendan Rodgers has cajoled the best from the striker on the pitch. Down and out: Luis Suarez crouches on the Selhurst Park turf after Liverpool threw away their lead . Hiding away: Steven Gerrard guides Luis Suarez away after Liverpool's costly draw at Crystal Palace . Consoling: Suarez was desolate after Liverpool effectively handed the Premier League to Manchester City . Slumped: Suarez and Liverpool must hope Manchester City slip up over the next two games . But there is also the sense that Suarez has repaid the debt with his blistering form and goals this season and is now entitled to look for a new challenge, most likely at Real Madrid or Barcelona. A 2-0 defeat by Chelsea at Anfield last week and the squandering of a 3-0 lead at Crystal Palace on Monday night will only fuel the speculation that one of the world’s best players could be heading for a club where he perhaps has more opportunity to establish himself as a great of the game. There were rumours that Suarez was heading to Spain even before Liverpool’s title challenge began to unravel. Real Madrid president Florentino Perez is thought to have set his sights on luring Suarez from England to Spain just as he did with Gareth Bale last summer. Suarez will have watched the Welshman excel at the Bernabeu and be rewarded with a Champions League final later this month and a battle against Barcelona and Atletico Madrid for the La Liga title. Calm before the storm: Suarez scored his 31st Premier League goal of the season to put Liverpool 3-0 up . Before it all went wrong: Suarez celebrates with team-mate Raheem Sterling at Selhurst Park . Main man: Suarez has been in blistering form this season but could be a summer target for Real Madrid . Suarez signed a lucrative new deal in . December to keep him at Liverpool until 2017 but if they were to sell . this summer, the club could expect to triple the £22.8m it cost to bring . him from Ajax in 2011. Suarez, . from Salto, in northwestern Uruguay, could be tempted by a return to a . Spanish-speaking environment. Next month he will link up with his . compatriots to prepare for the World Cup. Four members of the current . Uruguay squad play in Spain - three for Atletico Madrid and one for . Espanyol – and will no doubt extol the virtues of Spanish life and . football. Suarez claimed . just last week that he was happy at Liverpool but the way the Premier . League trophy has slipped from their grasp has clearly deeply affected . the 27-year-old. He . recognises that this could be the best chance Liverpool have to win the . title over the next few years against the financial might of Manchester . City and Chelsea. Dream link up: Suarez has been courted by Real Madrid and could team up with Gareth Bale (right) World's best: Suarez would surely relish the chance to play alongside Cristiano Ronaldo at Madrid .

Robin van Persie moved up to Manchester United after leaving . Arsenal. Most recently Bale jetted off to Madrid from Tottenham.

Here, Sportsmail runs you through 10 reasons why the Premier League title race is far from over… . 1)    They've done it once... Aston Villa have already beaten Manchester City this season. Twice they were trailing at Villa Park – Yaya Toure and Edin Dzeko having scored either side of Karim El Ahmadi – but two goals inside three minutes courtesy of Leandro Bacuna and Andreas Weimann turned the game in the home side’s favour. They’ve done it once, no reason why they can’t do it again. Salute: Andreas Weimann celebrates after scoring the winner for Aston Villa against Manchester City . 2)    They've done it twice... In fact, they’ve done it more than once. For Villa were 4-2 victors at the Etihad last season during the third round of the Capital One Cup. Gabby Agbonlahor scored twice on that occasion and, should he be passed fit, the forward will no doubt be buoyed by that man-of-the-match showing. Gift of the Gab: Gabby Agbonlahor was on target when Villa won 4-2 at City in the Capital One Cup last season . 3)    Daft lads might leave Reds laughing... Gary Neville certainly thinks Villa have it within them to produce an upset. ‘Villa have some daft players, they could do something stupid in big games like score three goals on the counter attack,’ he said, burying a compliment somewhere in his observation. They have taken 10 points off the top four this season, more than any other team outside that upper echelon. 4)    Away the lads... Villa are away. For when Paul Lambert’s men escape the expectation of their own back yard they are an altogether different proposition. On away form they would be 11th in the table, as opposed to the 17th they occupy in the home standings. They perform far better on the road and, with their Premier League safety guaranteed, the pressure has eased. Away the lads: Villa have fared better on the road this season . 5)    City stallers... City entertained the division’s bottom side – Sunderland – last month and, were it not for a goalkeeping howler from Vito Mannone two minutes from time, they would have been beaten, Samir Nasri salvaging a 2-2 draw. They have it within them to stutter on home soil (remember Wigan in the FA Cup?) and, with both Villa and West Ham supposed walkovers, complacency may yet prove their undoing. Held: Connor Wickham scored twice as Sunderland - then bottom of the league - emerged with a 2-2 draw from the Etihad . 6)    There will be no power Serg... Sergio Aguero is missing because of injury. Okay, Edin Dzeko is enjoying a rich run in front of goal, but Alvaro Negredo has not scored in the league since January and the absence of the Argentine could yet prove costly. Blow: Sergio Aguero will be missing against Aston Villa because of injury . 7)    There's time for a twist... Liverpool were long odds-on shots to triumph in the title race last month following their victory at Norwich and City’s failure to beat Sunderland. If this season has shown us anything, however, it is that the certainties are just as easily turned over. Villa, for the record, are 20/1 shots to nick a win at Eastlands and we wouldn’t rule out another twist in the tale just yet. There are four-and-a-half hours still to play after all. 8)    Reds' opponents are out of Toon... Liverpool have it relatively easy on the last day of the season, entertaining a Newcastle side who have lost their last four on the road without scoring a goal. A few early goals at Anfield - as has been the norm in recent months - could make for a nervy atmosphere at the Etihad were the score still tied. Flying: Liverpool, and the likes of Philippe Coutinho (right), have been on fire at Anfield this season . 9)     Can Manuel go the distance? Despite managing in Europe for the best part of a decade – including a spell at Real Madrid - Manuel Pellegrini has never won a league title on this continent. Neither, of course, has Brendan Rodgers. But the pressure is on Pellegrini more than his opposite number on Merseyside - can he handle the strain? Feeling the strain? Manuel Pellegrini has never won a league title in his 10 years managing in Europe . 10)    Liverpool ARE top… . Liverpool, don’t forget, remain one point clear at the summit of the Premier League. And, until that changes, it would be foolish to declare this race run.","Manchester City have two games left to play this season .
Manuel Pellegrini's team will face Aston Villa tonight and West Ham on Sunday .

"Liverpool have offered Mario Balotelli huge financial incentives in the hope they will help the controversial striker fulfil his potential at Anfield. After Liverpool agreed a £16million fee with AC Milan and held a string of positive meetings with Mino Raiola, the player’s agent, Balotelli flew into Manchester on Friday night for his medical and to meet Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers face-to-face for the first time. Hundreds of Liverpool fans cheered him when he finally left the training ground, leaving him in no doubt he will be warmly welcomed at Anfield.If all goes well, the Italy striker will sign a three-year deal, worth £85,000-£90,000 per week. But there is also a bonus element worked to the contract that will see him rewarded if he reaches certain targets and does not step out of line. VIDEO Scroll down to watch the biggest, badest and best moments of Mario Balotelli . Mario fever: Balotelli meets fans outside Melwood training ground after talks over £16m move from AC Milan .

Friday fun: Hundreds of fans gathered outside training ground to catch a glimpse of Balotelli . Super striker: Balotelli arrives at Melwood for talks after flying from Italy in private jet . The contract is also loaded with disciplinary measures that will be taken against the player if he transgresses. Should Balotelli stay out of trouble, Liverpool have the option to add a year to his contract. Rodgers refused questions on Balotelli at his press conference but insisted that the hard-working environment he has built up during the past two years is strong enough to welcome any new individual into the fold. ‘Character is very important so no player would come in here if I felt it couldn’t work,’ Rodgers said. ‘It’s not just the coaching element. I always look at people as well — if I can help the person then it’s something I’ll look at. ‘People who know me well will tell you that I try to develop the player and the person. If I feel that someone cares enough, I will give them everything. Incoming: Mario Balotelli is heading to Liverpool to complete his £16m move from Milan . Rules: Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers insists Balotelli will follow the club's strict code of conduct . On his way: Balotelli climbs into his Ferrari at his home in Brescia as he makes his way to Liverpool . ‘We have a culture that creates the talents and gives them the opportunity to blossom. Nothing will ever stand in the way of that. As long as they show they care, want to learn and develop, we can give them the opportunity.’ The Balotelli move represents a U-turn after Rodgers said emphatically on August 4 in Miami that the former Manchester City forward would not come to Liverpool. But having been constantly frustrated when pursuing other targets — Loic Remy failed a medical, a move to take Radamel Falcao for a season would have cost more than £20m, while Samuel Eto’o is now being considered — Rodgers had another look at what Balotelli might offer. The Northern Irishman has always admired Balotelli’s ability but once negotiations began — Liverpool initially enquired about taking him on loan — it became apparent there was significant value to be had from a forward with his ability. How is was: Balotelli playing against Liverpool in the colours of Man City back in August 2012 . International duty: Balotelli in action for Italy against Uruguay at the World Cup this summer . Rodgers said: ‘Where I’m at with building the club, if we thought we were bringing in a player we felt was a risk... well, two years ago I couldn’t have done it as the environment wasn’t created. ‘What we have here now is a culture of people working very hard, an infrastructure that’s set up to flourish. If you come into that and you’re not that (type of) character it would be really difficult for you. ‘This is a club that’s not like many others. This is a strong family club, with values and ethics that run over many years. ‘Sometimes you have to take a risk with people and a lot of the time if you take that risk you can get a reward for it.’ If there is a late hitch, Liverpool would turn to Eto’o and, as a precaution, they sent a medical team to Paris yesterday to run tests on the Cameroon striker. As it stands, though, Balotelli is likely to be confirmed as a Liverpool player over the weekend. His squad number is yet to be decided but both 45 — the one he has favoured throughout his career — and 7, Liverpool’s most iconic shirt, are available. If Rodgers is relishing the chance to work with Balotelli, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini was rather more cryptic about a player who helped City win the title in 2011-12. ‘I know the character of Mario Balotelli,’ said Pellegrini. ‘If Liverpool decide he is the player that is important for them, perfect for them and perfect for Mario. ‘It is not my duty to analyse what happened here when he was a Manchester City player.’","Rodgers said £16m signing Mario Balotelli will adhere to same set of rules as all other Liverpool players .

"Adam Lallana looks set to snub Manchester United after setting his heart on a summer move to Liverpool.

On his way? Southampton's Adam Lallana could be set for a summer move to Liverpool . Southampton continue to insist their star players are going nowhere but should be braced for offers as soon as the season finishes next month. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers will authorise an opening bid of around £15m for Lallana, who is expected to play in the hole behind Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge. He can expect to double his £35,000-a-week earnings. Roy Hodgson will name the 25-year-old in his England World Cup squad despite nagging concerns over a groin injury, which might have kept him out of the final two Barclays Premier League matches.

"By CRAIG HOPE FOR MAILONLINE . Manchester United now boast an attacking triumvirate to rival the best in the Premier League. In adding Radamel Falcao to Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, Louis van Gaal has assembled a front three which will certainly make for exciting viewing this season. But how do they compare to each other? Sportsmail's CRAIG HOPE takes a closer look… . RADAMEL FALCAO . GOALSCORING . Goals are the currency in which the Colombian trades, with Falcao once admitting he is ‘obsessed’ with finding the back of the net. His numbers tally; 155 goals in 200 games since moving to Europe in 2009. Like Van Persie, though, you can’t score from the treatment room, but if he’s on the park then goals are as good as guaranteed. SCORE: 9/10 . Guaranteed: Manchester United's deadline day signing Radamel Falcao's stock in trade is goals . ASSISTS . His obsession with goals evidently doesn’t extend to laying them on for team-mates. Indeed, he has made just four in the past three seasons, although 73 chances created suggests his colleagues may have let him down in converting such opportunities – Falcao himself would not be so wasteful. SCORE: 7/10 . LEADERSHIP . He’s never been a captain but has a powerful personality and an aura which should inspire others. His presence on the pitch can only be a good thing for a team lacking character in the past 12 months. SCORE: 7/10 . Strong return: Falcao's scored 155 goals in 200 games since his move to Europe . STAR QUALITY . His picture populated pretty much every back page across Europe following his deadline-day move to Old Trafford, and that is evidence enough of his star attraction. In the Premier League and United he now has a stage to amplify his allure. SCORE: 8.5/10 . TOTAL: 31.5/40 . WAYNE ROONEY . GOALSCORING . In 10 seasons at United his numbers equate to as good as one goal every two games. But that ratio is old money, the top strikers today return at least two in three (like Daniel Sturridge) or one in one (like Luis Suarez). Rooney was at the peak of his powers in 2012 – 34 goals bear testament to such – but his potency is on the wane and you fear the days of him plundering 20-plus league goals are a thing of the past. SCORE: 7.5/10 . Falling short: Wayne Rooney's return of a goal every two games is well short of top, top strikers these days . ASSISTS . Rooney is arguably a better creator of goals than scorer of them - he had a hand in 19 for team-mates in all competitions last season - and few can rival him when it comes to picking a deft pass in and around the danger zone. SCORE: 9/10 . Provider: Of United's star trio, Rooney is the best at laying on goals for others and picking out deft a pass . LEADERSHIP . Let’s be honest, his England captaincy came about by default and, at United, only Van Persie represented a realistic rival. Rather, it is Rooney’s reputation and status which has seen him inherit the armband for club and country, for he is not a natural leader in the mould of Bryan Robson, Roy Keane or Alan Shearer. SCORE: 6.5/10 . Default: Who else could Roy Hodgson have handed the England captaincy to after Steven Gerrard retired . STAR QUALITY . Nike commercials, FIFA covers, Rooney is still a huge name off the field. On it, however, he has to repair a reputation damaged by another failed showing at a major tournament and, of course, the disappointment of last season with United. SCORE: 7.5/10 . TOTAL: 30.5/40 . ROBIN VAN PERSIE . GOALSCORING . His first season at Old Trafford was phenomenal and, without his 26 goals, Sir Alex Ferguson would not have signed off with a Premier League title. But you can’t get goals from the stands and Van Persie’s fitness issues could hinder his chances to recreate that free-scoring form. Don’t forget, he has only netted more than 20 league goals in two seasons during his entire career – his last at Arsenal and first at Old Trafford. SCORE: 8/10 . Injury prone: Robin van Persie's extensive time off the pitch has diminished his value . Better days: Van Persie is a long way from his 26-goal season that helped Sir Alex Ferguson retire as a winner . ASSISTS . He’s a little more selfish than Rooney but nonetheless has still carved 21 goals for comrades over the last three seasons, his vision and cute left boot having created an impressive 180 chances in that same period. SCORE: 8/10 . LEADERSHIP . Captain of his country under Van Gaal, Van Persie still doesn’t fall in the category of chest-thumping general. There is a maturity about his mindset and persona, however, and he automatically commands respect from team-mates. SCORE: 7.5/10 . Commands respect: Van Persie isn't a chest-beating general but is revered within United's ranks . STAR QUALITY . He’s not as interested as Rooney in promoting the ‘brand’, but ability and reputation has it that he remains a global star. His diving header against Spain at the World Cup did him no harm in that respect, but memory of last season in the Premier League – form and fitness having eluded him – means he has a point to prove this time around. SCORE: 7.5/10 . TOTAL: 31/40 .

"Four days after winning control of the Philadelphia Inquirer following a bitter legal battle, owner Lewis Katz, 72, died in a fiery plane crash on Saturday morning. The newspaper confirmed Katz's death on Sunday morning after the Gulfstream IV private jet he was traveling aboard burst into flames taking off from Hanscom Field in Bedford, Massachusetts, bound for Atlantic City. All seven passengers died, including Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of his son Drew's foundation and Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey. Authorities have yet to announce the identities of the other passengers who perished. Nearby residents recounted seeing a fireball and feeling the blast of the explosion shake their homes. Authorities have not speculated on what caused the crash. They have said the National Transportation Safety Board will soon launch an investigation . Scroll down for video . A private plane ran off a runway and burst into flames with seven people on-board at Hanscom Field Saturday night . Lewis Katz, co-owner of the Philadelphia Inquirer, was confirmed to be one of the seven on board the flight. All of the passengers perished . The plane was headed to Atlantic City International Airport in New Jersey when it apparently went off the runway and crashed at 9:40pm then caught fire, authorities said. On Tuesday, Lewis Katz and H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest bought out their business partners for $88 million and gained control of the media company that owns the Inquirer. His tragic death 'won't derail the sale of the Inquirer, Daily News & Philly.com' the newspaper said on its Twitter feed. Lenfest told the newspaper he has owned for less than a week, 'It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will replace his father on board of our new company.' However, Lenfest did admit that there would be a delay in the finalizing of the deal, but that it was expected to close after June 12. The new owner said that the newspaper would be hard pressed to replace Katz's expertise and creativity, but that 'the paper will continue because we both intended to put a new CEO in charge of the day-to-day operations'. Katz made his money investing in the Kinney Parking empire and once owned the NBA's New Jersey Nets and the NHL's New Jersey Devils and donated money to Temple University. The battle over the Philadelphia Inquirer was sparked in part by the decision to fire the paper's Pulitzer Prize-winning editor. Katz and Lenfest tried to get a court to block the firing and the dispute culminated in the pair ousting their former partners. Jeff Patterson told The Boston Globe he saw a fireball about 60 feet in the air. 'I heard a big boom, and I thought at the time that someone was trying to break into my house because it shook it,' said Patterson's son, 14-year-old Jared Patterson. 'I thought someone was like banging on the door trying to get in.' The air field has been closed for further investigation. Boston.com . reports that residents who lived as far as Boston could smell burning . rubber and many took to Twitter to describe the incident. 'Can actually see particles in air in Cambridge, Porter Square allegedly from Hanscom crash,' tweeted Aubry Bracco. Katz, 72, and business partner H.F. 'Gerry' Lenfest only recently became the controlling owners of the Inquirer, The . Daily News and Philly.com after buying out the other partners for . $88million in a Tuesday private auction. 'We . all deeply mourn the loss of my true friend and fellow investor in . ownership of The Philadelphia Inquirer, The Daily News and Philly.com,' Lenfest said. 'It is a severe loss, but I am pleased to announce that . Drew Katz, Lewis's son, will replace his father on the board of our new . company.' Drew Katz issued a statement of his own as well, praising his father. 'My father was my best friend. He . taught me everything. He never forgot where and how he grew up, and he . worked tirelessly to support his community in countless ways that were . seen and unseen,' Drew Katz said in a statement. 'He loved his native . city of Camden and his adopted home of Philadelphia. He believed in . strengthening education through his founding of charter schools, his . support of the Boys & Girls Clubs and his generosity to his alma . maters, Temple University and Dickinson Law School. But his greatest . accomplishment by far was being the most amazing father to my sister and . me, and grandparent to his four grandchildren.' Anne Leeds, wife of Longport, New . Jersey commissioner James Leeds, was also on the plane. She was . reportedly a neighbor of Katz's. Mr Leeds told the Press of Atlantic City that his wife was invited last minute to attend a fundraiser with Katz in Concord, Saturday afternoon. The Boston Globe reports that Katz attended an event at the home of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin and her husband Richard Goodwin. Mystery: Authorities haven't announced what caused the plane to burst into flames taking off . The private plane was en route to Atlantic City, New Jersey . Mr . Leeds says that event was in support of an education program the . Goodwin's son Michael created for Concord Carlisle schools - a matter of . interest to Mrs Leeds, a retired Pennsylvania school teacher. Marcella Dalsey, the executive director of the Drew A Katz Foundation, also died in the crash. Ms . Dalsey, a South New Jersey native, was also the president of KATZ . Academy Charter School which she co-founded with Katz in 2012. Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey - the wife of former Camden County Prosecutor Sam Asbell – was another victim, NBC10 Philadelphia reports.

Susan Asbell of Cherry Hill, New Jersey was the third victim named. Pictured above with husband Sam Asbell, former Camden County prosecutor . New owner: Katz and business partner Gerry Lenfest bought out competing partners for controlling ownership of the Inquirer on Tuesday. He is seen smiling before entering the private auction . Before the auction, Katz and Lenfest owned 42.55 per cent of the team. They bought out a competing group led by George E Norcross III, who previously held a 57.45 per cent stake. The buyout promised to bring more stability to the media company, which had undergone six ownership changes in eight years. 'We know more than anybody how difficult this business is,' Katz told employees Tuesday afternoon at the company's headquarters. 'We're going to give it our best. We're going to try to bring in the best. And, hopefully, we'll have a wonderful result.' Katz grew up in Camden, New Jersey and attended Temple University. He made his fortune with businesses Kinney Parking and Yankees Entertainment and Sports Network. Before taking on the Inquirer, Katz owned sports teams the New Jersey Nets (before the team relocated to Brooklyn) and New Jersey Devils. Tragedy: Emergency workers are still working on the scene but have confirmed all seven passengers were killed in the blast .

"The disappearance of MH370 has been described as ‘deliberate’ and ‘calculated’ in the latest book to be published on the tragedy. New Zealand authors Ewan Wilson, a commercial pilot and Hamilton City Councillor, and Waikato Times journalist Geoff Taylor, said they used a process of elimination to lead readers to the revelation that the tragedy was no accident. Wilson told stuff.co.nz that the conclusion of Good Night Malaysian 370: The truth behind the loss of Flight 370 will shock the travelling public. Scroll down for video . Ewan Wilson (left) and Geoff Taylor (right) claim their book about the missing MH370 plane will shock the public . ‘For the first time we present a detailed analysis of the flight, the incredible route it took, and who we believe was in charge of the aircraft as it plunged into the Indian Ocean,’ Wilson said. The book begins at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on March 8 and weaves in the lives of the 239 passengers and crew on board what was meant to be a short flight to Beijing. Wilson, a former CEO of two airlines and with qualifications in transport safety investigations, said the men investigated each piece of evidence and eliminated all the possible scenarios until the reader is left with 'one shocking and unbelievable conclusion'. ‘The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 captured the world's attention and shocked everyone - [the outcome] is gut-wrenching,’ he said. The authors travelled to Malaysia to interview authorities and family members of MH370's pilot, Zaharie Ahmad Shah. Two New Zealand men are publishing a book claiming that the disappearance of the MH370 plane was not an accident and should never have happened . Taylor said authorities were not willing to admit the truth. ‘For the sake of the relatives of those on the flight the truth needs to be out there,’ he said. ‘We visited the departure lounge where families sat full of excitement and anticipation waiting for their boarding call. Surely they deserve better than a cover up?' During a late night visit to the departure lounge Taylor recalled the moment his conclusion swept over him. ‘What happened to MH370 was no accident,’ he said. ‘It was deliberate and it was calculated and it should never have been allowed to happen.’ Wilson said the March 8 mystery could determine which airlines passengers choose in the future. The authors also recommend immediate changes to the management of flight crews and the introduction of tamper-proof technical systems to ensure the aircraft can be tracked at all times. Meanwhile, Australia has chosen a state-of-the-art Dutch vessel to help map the Indian Ocean floor as the search for missing flight MH370 heads deeper under water. The MV Fugro Equator will make its way to Australia to work with the Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhena in mapping the Indian Ocean floor for the next phase of the MH370 search . Netherlands-based Fugro Survey will assist a Chinese military vessel in surveying the ocean bed as part of the next stage of the quest for the Malaysia Airlines plane which vanished three months ago. The MV Fugro Equator, which is equipped with a deep water multi-beam echo sounder system, will work with Chinese PLA-Navy ship Zhu Kezhen to complete the mapping ahead of the underwater search by an as-yet undetermined contractor. The Australian Transport Safety Bureau is now planning to comb a 60,000 square-kilometre (24,000 square-mile) search zone based on the plane's last satellite communication. The Joint Agency Coordination Centre (JACC) stated that the survey would provide crucial information to help plan the deep water search for MH370 which is scheduled to begin in August. ‘The bathymetric (ocean floor) survey will provide a map of the underwater search zone, charting the contours, depths and composition of the seafloor in water depths up to 6,000 metres,’ the JACC said. Fugro said in a statement that it expected its vessel to start mapping in mid-June which was expected to take about three months. Australia has set aside $90 million to find MH370 - expected to be the most the country has spent in aviation history . The Malaysian government has revealed it has spent just a fraction of what Australia has paid in the search for missing flight MH370, as officials from both countries prepare to meet to discuss the next phase of the mission. But Federal  Treasurer Joe Hockey said Australia will pay its fair share in the search for the missing Malaysia Airlines plane. 'It is understood that the plane went down in waters that are our responsibility, and there is a cost to having responsibility and we don't shirk that,' he told reporters on Tuesday morning. 'We accept responsibility and will pay for it. We're not a country that begs others for money to do our job.' The Australian government has set aside almost $90 million for the search - expected to be the most expensive in aviation history - but it's possible that figure could increase. More than three months have passed since the Malaysia Airlines Boeing 777 disappeared en route from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people aboard - including six Australians. The Boeing 777 is believed to have crashed in the southern Indian Ocean, but an extensive search has turned up no sign of wreckage. The Australia Transport Safety Board last week issued a tender to continue the deep-water search for the ill-fated flight.","A commercial pilot and a journalist have written Good Night Malaysian 370: The truth behind the loss of Flight 370 .

"Anti-terror police are set to arrest up to 12 British associates of Islamic State executioner Jihadi John, it has been reported. British and American authorities say they know the identity of the hostage killer - and are set to reveal it within days. The executioner is one of four British jihadis known as the 'Beatles' holding hostages in Syria. Scroll down for video . British and American authorities say they know the identity of the hostage killer 'Jihadi John' - and are set to reveal it within days. They are now in a race against . time to save the life of British hostage David Haines . Sources told the Mirror that anti-terror experts from the UK and U.S. know the identity of three of them and are tracking down the group. An FBI team flown into Britian last month is now closing in on 12 suspects in the UK, who are believed to have provided money, contacts and helped Jihadi John travel to Syria. An American source told the paper the 'hardened terrorists' include several from the West Midlands who are already known to UK security services. They said : 'We are 99.9% certain now as to who ‘John’ is but investigators have had to tread softly in charting and approaching his wider network in the UK. 'Familiar names of what can only be described as hardened extremists with a jihadi background have cropped up in this investigation.' American journalist James Foley was the first to be beheaded by the masked executioner. He is one of four British jihadis holding hostages in Syria known as the 'Beatles' Gruesome footage of the execution of fellow American hostage Steven Sotloff was released last week . The source said the identity of the executioners would most likely be revealed officially within the coming days. Gruesome footage showing the beheading of American journalist James Foley was released last month by the Islamic State, followed by a video of the execution of fellow American hostage Steven Sotloff last week. Authorities are now in a race against time to save the life of British hostage, aid worker David Haines, who the masked jihadi has revealed is next for execution. It comes after it was reported that father-of-two Mr Haines has been struggling to hold down food and suffering from acute gastric and other health problems in his cramped captivity. The disclosure that Haines, 44, has been suffering physical difficulties alongside inevitable mental turmoil must have added to the distress of his wife Dragana, who lives in Croatia with their four-year-old daughter, and family in Scotland during their agonising wait for news. A security source familiar with the cases described the hostages’ internment as a ‘living hell’. Mr Haines, originally from Perth in Scotland, has been badly tortured, especially during the first six months after his abduction in March last year at a refugee camp in northern Syria. IS videos show British and US captives dressed in orange jumpsuits, a clear reference to prisoners at Guantanamo Bay. The most recent video showed a gaunt Haines held by the collar as a black-clad, English extremist warned Britain to abandon ‘this evil alliance of America’.","British and American authorities say they know identity of hostage killer .

"Grieving relatives of the victims of MH17 plane atrocity are preparing to sue Vladimir Putin over allegations he was involved. Lawyers from Britain are in talks with Ukrainian partners over how it would file legal action on behalf of the victims after the passenger jet was shot down by pro-Russian separatists over eastern Ukraine. The potential multi-million-pound lawsuit is likely to further damage relations between Russia and the West and comes as Malaysian Airlines announced it would be rebranding its company. Russian President Vladmir Putin could face legal action worth millions of pounds as family prepare to take legal action over the Malaysian Airlines MH17 atrocity . London law firm McCue & Partners, which has previously brought claims against former Libyan leader Colonel Muammar Gaddafi, has taken on the case which is likely to be put through the US courts. A spokesman from the company, which is inviting families to take part in the action, said in a statement to the Sunday Telegraph: ‘There has been talk of civil suits against Malaysia Airlines, but those immediately responsible are not only the separatists who are alleged to have fired the rocket at Flight MH17, causing the death of hundreds of innocent victims, but those, be they states, individuals or other entities, who provided them with financial and material support and the means to do so. ‘Our team is presently liaising and working with partners in Ukraine and the US on whether, apart from civil suits against the airline, legal action can be brought against the perpetrators on the victims' behalf.’ A team of four Australians and four Dutch investigators have already touched down in the city of Donetsk, close to where the plane came down, while talks have been held over plans to despatch an international police force and military to secure the crash site. It is thought that Russian-backed rebels shot down the Boeing 777 after mistaking it for a Ukrainian military aircraft. Putin pictured with Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu as they watch the Navy Day Military parade earlier today . Putin, who is pictured on a visit to Northern Fleet main naval base in Severomorsk, has alleged to have been involved in the MH17 plane crash on July 17 . There is evidence that the plane, which was carrying 298 people including 10 Britons, was brought down by a Russian-made SA-11 missile. Malaysia Airlines revealed today is looking at a number of options to restructure its business, which could include changing its name. It is also considering new routes and expanding out-sourcing to increase profitability. The move follows the most recent . disaster in Ukraine on July 17 and the disappearance of MH370 on March . 8, which went missing with all 239 passengers and crew on board. Meanwhile, it was reported today that unreleased data from the MH17's black box show findings consistent with the plane's fuselage being hit multiple times by shrapnel from a missile explosion. Human remains lay exposed at the crash site for several days before they were collected and bodies returned to families. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg has joined calls for Russia to be stripped of its right to host the 2018 World Cup. He said it was 'unthinkable' at present that the tournament could go ahead in the country blamed by the West for supplying arms to separatist rebels accused of causing the crash.

"Aaron Hernandez has used ‘coded messages’ to discuss the Odin Lloyd murder from prison, authorities claim. A Thursday court filing from the Bristol County (MA) District Attorney accuses the former New England Patriots tight end of talking about the murder with fiancée Shayanna Jenkins and cousin Tanya Cummings Singleton. The recorded conversations mostly took place during visits the two women made to the county jail since Mr Hernandez was incarcerated in June, the papers first reported by the Boston Globe said. He talked in code: Former New England Patriots tight end Aaron Hernandez (pictured in October) talked in 'coded messages' with Shayanna Jenkins and Tanya Cummings Singleton about the Odin Lloyd murder case, authorities say . The DA made the filing to request copies of the conversations from the county sheriff as further evidence in their case against Mr Hernandez. ‘We did file a motion, and what’s in the documents is pretty self-explanatory,’ DA spokesperson Gregg Miliote told MailOnline. He declined to provide further details while citing a gag order issued by the court. ‘During those conversations, the defendant has discussed the following matters directly relevant to the circumstances surrounding the murder of Odin Lloyd,’ said the affidavit. The former all-pro is accused of discussing what he believes is his criminal liability, related prior offenses, denials of ownership of a vehicle impounded by police, his control of persons outside the jail and the whereabouts of others implicated in the slaying, said the filing. Ms Singleton and Ms Jenkins have been charged as co-conspirators. Accused co-conspirators: Cousin Tanya Cummings Singleton (left) and fiancee Shayanna Jenkins (right) face charges for their involvement in the murder case, and are accused of receiving the coded messages . ‘Both of these co-defendants have been charged as accessories in the underlying offense of murder on the theory that they provided assistance to the defendant after the commission of that offense,’ the affidavit said. These conversations took place despite all three of the accused being advised the conversations were being recorded, authorities said. Most happened during visits, but some were outbound calls placed from prison. The recordings can be used against all three during court proceedings. Only calls between Mr Hernandez and his attorneys are off-limits during trial. Messages left by MailOnline seeking comment from Mr Hernandez’s legal team were not immediately returned. An attempt to reach the Bristol County Sheriff’s Office was not successful. The . motion was filed the same day Ms Singleton posted bail after spending . months behind bars for aiding accomplice Ernest Wallace’s flight from . Massachusetts. Back in court soon: The next pretrial hearing in the case is scheduled for Wednesday . Also filed Friday was a motion by Mr Hernandez’s legal team seeking clarification as to whether authorities believe he fired the shots that killed Mr Lloyd or if he acted in concert with co-defendants Mr Wallace and Carlos Ortiz. ‘If Hernandez is alleged to be a joint venturer as to the murder count, the bill of particulars should identify the alleged principal or principals,’ the filing said, according to the Fall River Herald News. Mr Hernandez is due again in court on Wednesday for another pretrial hearing.","The disgraced former all-pro is accused of talking in code with cousin Tanya Cummings Singleton and fiancee Shayanna Jenkins .

"Aaron Hernandez has been charged with the double murder of two strangers in 2012 after leaving a Boston nightclub in 2012 and prosecutors say that it stemmed over a spilled drink. The states' attorneys detailed the charges and the evidence against Hernandez at a Wednesday afternoon hearing and said that one of his alleged victims bumped into him at a nightclub and spilled a drink. That interaction allegedly set Hernandez, who previously played as a tight end for the New England Patriots football team until being tied to the murder of his acquaintance Odin Lloyd in 2013. Hearing the details: Aaron Hernandez is already charged for a 2013 murder of an acquaintance but now he faces double murder charges stemming from a 2012 drive by shooting after a night club interaction gone wrong . His side: Hernandez, 24, has entered not guilty pleas in connection to all three murders . Hernandez has pled not guilty to all three of the murders, which are being tried in two separate cases. The prosecuting attorney went through the evening on July 16, 2012 that led to the drive-by deaths of Daniel de Abreu and Safiro Furtado. 'I think I got one in the head and one in the chest' -Aaron Hernandez said to a friend after firing off at least five shots into a neighboring car in 2012, according to state prosecutors . The shooting had long been an unsolved murder but police reopened the case following the murder of Lloyd because there was speculation that Lloyd, a semi-professional football player who was dating Hernandez's fiancée’s sister, had some information about the 2012 double murder. Hernandez was reportedly acting paranoid and believed that people were 'testing, trying and or otherwise disrespecting' him at the nightclub, and those feelings came to a head when de Abreu reportedly bumped into Hernandez while dancing, causing the then-professional football player to spill his drink. He reportedly thought that de Abreau smiled after the incident and did not apologize, which caused Hernandez to get upset. The prosecutor claimed that Hernandez had two more drinks and watched de Abreu and his group from inside the club so that he would know when they were leaving. 'Disrespect': Safiro Furtado (left) was in the car with Daniel de Abreu (right) who reportedly bumped into Herndandez while dancing and spilled the football player's drink . Bail denied: Hernandez, seen at left in court on Wednesday, is already being held without bail due to the 2013 murder charge but his bail request connected to this 2012 double murder was also denied . The prosecutor told how after leaving . the club on the night of July 16, Hernandez got into the passenger seat . of an SUV that he was test driving while his friend got behind the . wheel. Victim: Odin Lloyd was found murdered near to Hernandez's apartment last summer . They proceeded to follow the car that de Abreu and Furtado, who was pictured by the local CBS affiliate, got into when they left the club. After Hernandez's car 'pulled up close along the passenger side of the car... (Hernandez) leaned out with a loaded .38 revolver,' the prosecutor told the court, and Hernandez reportedly said '""Yo what's up now"" and then a racial slur.' He 'immediately fired at least five rounds from the .38 revolver.... (and) continued to pull the trigger even after the round was finished.' The prosecutor did not say how he got the following information, but he told the courtroom that Hernandez proceeded to say 'I think I got one in the head and one in the chest' as his friend sped the SUV away from the crime scene. He went on to explain how the Bristol, . Connecticut native and his friend drove to his cousin's house in that . town and spent the night there, saying that Hernandez 'searched the . internet and media accounts for the Boston shooting'. The . cousin, reportedly brought a second car for Hernandez to drive home the . next day and the SUV that was used on the night of July 16 remained . untouched in her garage for months, even accumulating spiderwebs. Not talking: Shayanna Jenkins, Hernandez's fiancee and the mother of his daughter, was at the court hearing on Wednesday (pictured) but did not speak to the media . Heartbreaking: The relatives of Hernandez's two alleged victims got emotional at the Wednesday hearing . Support: The two women held each other after the hearing- which lasted about 20 minutes- was over . Hernandez's attorney strongly objected to the night being recounted in such specific detail, arguing that the court was being turned into a media 'spectacle' that would 'poison' the jury pool against the former NFL star. 'The defendant has been subjected to an avalanche of publicity none of which we are responsible for,' Hernandez's attorney said.","Hernandez is now being held without bail in connection to a 2012 double murder- on top of his previous 2013 murder charge .
Prosecutor claims that on the night of July 16, 2012, Hernandez and friends were in a Boston nightclub and a stranger bumped into him, causing him to spill his drink .

"Vladimir Putin has issued a defiant warning that the MH17 crash must not be used for 'selfish political ends' and urged separatists to allow international experts access to the crash site. Wearing a dark suit and looking tired and drawn during a rare television address, the Russian president insisted 'all people' in Ukraine had a responsibility to the families of the 298 passengers and crew who died last week. But he added: 'No-one has the right to use this tragedy for any kind of vested interest in the political sense. Such incidents should unite people rather than separate them.' His comments came just hours after David Cameron issued a stark warning to Putin that his billionaire ‘cronies’ will have their assets frozen in London unless Russia co-operates with the investigation. Hitting back: Wearing a dark suit and looking tired and drawn, Russian president Vladimir Putin issued a defiant warning that the MH17 crash must not be used for 'selfish political' advantage . Rows of bodies: Bagged victims can be seen above lined up in front of a truck yesterday at the crash site, ready to be moved to the refrigerated trains . Final indignity: Rescue workers, pictured above, loaded the corpses onto trucks at the crash site in eastern Ukraine, which were then taken to refrigerated train carriages nine miles away . Meanwhile, Putin has been examining samples of aviation equipment at the Production Rocket Space Centre . There are already representatives of Donetsk and Lugansk working there, as well as representatives of the emergencies ministry of Ukraine and others. But this is not enough. This task force is not enough. We need more, we need a fully representative group of experts to be working at the site under the guidance of ICAO, the relevant international commission. We must do everything to provide security for the international experts on the site of the tragedy.  We need to do everything to provide its [ICAO commission’s] safety, to provide the humanitarian corridors necessary for its work. In the meantime, nobody should and has no right to use this tragedy to achieve their narrowly selfish political goals. We repeatedly called upon all conflicting sides to stop the bloodshed immediately and sit down at the negotiating table. I can say with confidence that if military operations were not resumed on June 28 in eastern Ukraine, this tragedy wouldn’t have happened. During his television address this morning, Putin said it is necessary for 'all people' involved in the current conflict in Ukraine take responsibility for their actions. He said there was a duty . to: 'improve their responsibility to their own people, and to the people . of the countries whose representatives have been victims of this . crash'. Putin added, 'We need to do everything to ensure the security and safety of the observers and the experts working at the crash site.' The comments came as Chancellor George Osborne said the UK was prepared to take an 'economic hit' in order to put pressure on Moscow over its involvement in the Ukraine crisis. Cameron, . meanwhile, is due to make a statement to MPs later spelling out what . measures he believes should be taken following the apparent shooting . downing of the plane by rebels. In what was described by Downing Street as a 'frank' conversation last night, the Prime Minister told Mr Putin his support for insurgents in eastern Ukraine had 'contributed to an appalling tragedy' and the delay in experts being able to investigate was 'indefensible'. The chaos surrounding the handling of the crash has compounded the grief of families all around the world bereaved by the crash, who have been left unable to arrange funerals or properly mourn their dead. Victim's relatives have made emotional appeals for the bodies to be returned as soon as possible, amid reports that the refrigeration in the carriage has only been inconsistently working. Earlier the bodies . of almost 200 victims of the MH17 plane disaster were seen decaying for . a fourth day in a refrigerated train. Since . the bodies of the 298 victims fell from 33,000ft after their plane was . struck by a surface-to-air missile, they were left in the open in . sweltering heat for three days before being gathered up in bags, bundled . on to trucks and driven away. Grisly: The bodies of almost 200 victims of the MH17 plane disaster were seen for a fourth day in a refrigerated train which has done little to hold back the stench of decay which has already overtaken the corpses . Stench: A rebel can be seen holding his nose as the door to a carriage containing the heaped bodies is opened . The bodies . were taken from there to the town of Torez, nine miles away, where they . have been piled up in four refrigerated train carriages. The refrigeration has done little to hold back the stench of decay which has already overtaken . the corpses amid accusations the rebels are holding up the return of . the bodies unnecessarily. Rebel . commanders have reportedly promised that the train will leave this . afternoon, but gave no indication of where or whether the bodies would . be handed over. Further . pressure will be put on Russia to cooperate with the crash investigation at the United Nations, after Britain, Germany and France came to the agreement that the EU must be prepared to ratchet up sanctions if they refuse. It was not immediately known what the Malaysian team would do with the black boxes, but there was speculation they would pass the boxes on to experts with experience of reading the data . A Malaysian investigator, left, takes a black box as it is handed over by a Donetsk People's Republic official in the city of Donetsk . A meeting of EU foreign ministers tomorrow is expected to result in a more . punitive sanctions regime, with Mr Putin's 'crony group' possible . targets. The threats of extensive sanctions on Russian billionaires has already spooked a number of wealthy pro-Kremlin businessmen and women. 'The economic and business elite is just in horror,' Igor Bunin, the head of the Center for Political Technology in Moscow, told Bloomberg news. 'Nobody will speak out because of the implicit threat of retribution... Any sign of rebellion and they’ll be brought to their knees,' he added. One billionaire, speaking on condition . of anonymity, added that Putin risks becoming a pariah figure as wealthy . and powerful Russians seek to distance themselves from him to keep hold . of their money. The Prime Minister likened the failure to tackle Vladimir Putin to the appeasement of Hitler in the 1930s, while Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond said Russia risked becoming a 'pariah state' if it carried on arming rebels .

'It is absolutely in Britain's national economic interest that that is the case. 'Of course any sanctions will have an economic impact, and we are prepared to undertake further sanctions. 'But . think of the economic hit... of allowing international borders to be . ignored, of allowing airliners to be shot down. That is a much greater . economic hit for Britain.

"A 20-year-old man who was among 14 people struck by lightning on Sunday has died in hospital after rare summer thunderstorms swept through Southern California. Nine other people were hospitalized - including a 15-year-old and one in a critical condition - after the lightning hit Venice Beach in Los Angeles about 2.50pm. The incident occurred in the 3500 block of South Ocean Front Walk, which is the famed Venice Fishing Pier. Those enjoying a Sunday afternoon on the beach said they saw the bright flash of the lightning before people started fleeing the water, in what one witness described as like a scene from the film Jaws.

While others were treated at scene and . released, a swimmer who went missing in the water, sparking a major . search by lifegaurds, was among those hospitalized, Los Angeles fire spokeswoman Katherine Main said. Photos of the scene show lifeguards desperately giving CPR to a young man, who they pulled from the water. Witnesses said the victim did not appear to respond to the CPR. 'The guy wasn't moving. He wasn't responding at all,' Jesus Zamudio of Riverside told The Los Angeles Times. 'It was sad to see, the guy looked young.' A man is treated by paramedics while a woman is comforted after a lightning strike in Venice, California July 27, 2014 . Lifeguards assist a person who was in the water and apparently struck by lightning on Sunday July 27, 2014 in Los Angeles . Experts have said that the hundreds of lightning strikes that hit Southern California are rare but there is still a chance of storms today. The storms were caused as a moisture-laden monsoonal flow spread up from the south and swept across the region, all of the way out to the ocean. Stuart Seto, a weather specialist with the National Weather Service explained: 'This is pretty rare because usually the flow affects just the deserts and sometimes the mountains. 'The storms began to dissipate as they moved north-west leaving just a chance of storms through Monday, mainly on the deserts and mountains.' Lightning injuries or fatalities can occur during a direct strike or after a current is passed through the ground or jumps from a taller object, such as a tree, according to the National Weather Service. Symptoms can range from cardiac arrest and injury to the nervous system to muscle soreness, headache, and confusion. Steve . Christensen added that his friend had been body-surfing and was sitting . on the beach when lifeguards began searching for a missing swimmer. 'He . (Christensen's friend) went out to the water to find him and walked . right into him,' Mr Christensen said. 'He was face down on the bottom.' Mr Christensen added his friend pulled the man, who appeared to be in his 20s, from the water, and lifeguards began CPR before taking him away on a truck. The identity of the 20-year-old that was killed has not been released. Confirmation of the cause of death was pending an autopsy. Los Angeles County Coroner's Lt. Larry Dietz said he also can't confirm whether the man was a swimmer who was pulled from the water and given CPR. It is thought the man in a critical condition is a 55-year-old who had been surfing. Other witnesses told the publication the storm 'came out of nowhere'. Joe Doro also told NBC Los Angeles: 'It was the loudest thunder I've ever heard. 'It was like a scene out of Jaws, all the mothers were going in to grab their kids and drag them out of the water. While Stuart Acher said he was struck by lightning while playing volleyball on the beach. 'We . went about our game and then all of a sudden, there was a big flash of . light and a boom, and it felt like someone punched me in the back of my . head,' he told KABC-TV. 'It went down my whole side of my . right body, and my calves sort of locked up, and I fell over. And I . looked up and everybody else was, you know, falling over.' Paramedics examined Acher but he felt all right and went back to playing volleyball. 'The . majority of the folks that were on the (volleyball) court all felt a . little tingly,' said another player, Jerome Williams. 'Everyone hit the . court. It sounded like a sonic boom.'

County Sheriff's Department. The man was believed to be the 14th person hit in the storm. Denning did not have other details. The . lightning strikes occurred as a thunderstorm hit the island, causing . minor flooding and setting two small fires in the brushy backcountry . that were quickly doused, Denning said. The unusual weather came from monsoon moisture that brought a line of brief but fierce afternoon thunderstorms to the region. Evacuation: People move off the Venice Beach Boardwalk following lightning strikes on Sunday . The National Weather Service urged . residents in Venice and surrounding areas to stay indoors if they hear . thunder because lightning strikes. The .

"A spike in Pacific Ocean sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears that this year's El Niño could be one of the strongest yet. El Niño - a warming of sea-surface temperatures in the Pacific - affects wind patterns and can trigger both floods and drought in different parts of the globe. Although previous research has suggested extreme El Niño events could occur later this year, experts claim this recent rise hints they are likely to be more significant than first thought. A spike in Pacific Ocean sea temperatures and the rapid movement of warm water eastwards have increased fears this year's El Niño could be one of the strongest yet. El Niño, pictured left, is a warming of sea temperatures that can trigger floods and droughts. La Niña, pictured right, is when sea temperatures drop . El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (approximately 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. This has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere. Dr Wenju Cai, a climate expert at . Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research . Organisation, said the rises in Pacific Ocean temperature were above those seen . in previous El Niño years. ‘I think this event has lots of characteristics with a strong El Niño,’ said Cai. ‘A . strong El Nino appears early and we have seen this event over the last . couple of months, which is unusual; the wind that has caused the warming . is quite large and there is what we call the pre-conditioned effects, . where you must have a lot of heat already in the system to have a big El . Niño event.’ He based his conclusions on studying data released by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. A majority of weather forecasting models indicate that the phenomenon may develop around the middle of the year, but it was too early to assess its likely strength, the U.N. World Meteorological Organization said on 15 April. Meteorologists added the prospect of an El Niño will likely be firmed up 'in the next month or two', although forecasting its strength will be hard to do. The chance of an it developing in 2014 exceeded 70 per cent according to Australia's Bureau of Meteorology. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 to 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, pictured, that killed over 1,500 people. Australian climate experts claim the recent rises in sea temperature are above those seen in previous El Niño years and suggest this year's events will be 'significant' Its weather bureau is expected to issue its next El Niño outlook report on Tuesday, while Japan's meteorological agency is expected to updated its forecast in the next couple of weeks. The worst El Niño on record in 1997 and 1998 was blamed for massive flooding along China's Yangtze river, responsible for killing more than 1,500 people. The impact of extreme El Niño events is . felt by every continent, and the event in 1997 cost between $35billion to . $45billion in damage globally. A strong El Niño also increases fears that production of many key agricultural commodities in Asia and Australia will suffer. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. Here, the village of Puerto Maldonado, Peru, is seen flooded in January 2003 as a result of El Niño rains, which drove 16,000 people from their homes . The impact of this year's El Niño events is expected to be felt by every continent. During the 1997 to 1998 events, damages were said to have been in the region of between $35billion to $45billion. Beachfront homes in Malibu, California, pictured, collapsed after two weeks of high surf under El Niño weather conditions . Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Niños, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns. The new patterns result in flash floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. Extreme El Niño events are expected to double in frequency over the next 100 years. The impact of extreme El Niño events is felt by every continent. In January, a team of international . scientists said extreme weather events fuelled by unusually strong El . Niños are expected to double over the next century. Climate . scientists warned countries could be struck by devastating droughts, . wild fires and dramatic foods approximately every ten years. The team, made up of experts from the ARC Centre of Excellence for Climate System Science (CoECSS), the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and CSIRO, also  spotted a link between global warming and extreme El Niño events. ‘We currently experience an unusually strong El Niño event every 20 years. Our research shows this will double to one event every 10 years,’ said Agus Santoso of CoECSS, who co-authored the study. ‘El Niño events are a multi-dimensional problem and only now are we starting to understand better how they respond to global warming,’ he added. Extreme El Niño events develop differently from standard El Niños, which first appear in the western Pacific. The extreme events occur when sea surface temperatures exceeding 28°C develop in the normally cold and dry eastern equatorial Pacific Ocean. Scientists in Germany recently said they can forecast disruptive El Niño events a year in advance. They hope the forecast will help countries develop better strategies to counter the effects such as wild fires, pictured in the Philippines. Meteorologists said the prospect of a 2014 El Niño will be firmed up 'in the next month or two' This different location for the origin of the temperature increase causes massive changes in global rainfall patterns, which result in floods and torrential rain in some places and devastating droughts and wild fires in others. The impacts of extreme El Niño events that extended to every continent across the globe in 1997, for example, killed around 23,000 people. Dr Cai continued: ‘During an extreme El Niño event countries in the western Pacific, such as Australia and Indonesia, experienced devastating droughts and wild fires, while catastrophic floods occurred in the eastern equatorial region of Ecuador and northern Peru.’ In Australia, the drought and dry . conditions caused by the 1982 and 1983 extreme El Niño led to the Ash . Wednesday Bushfire in southeast Australia, which resulted in 75 deaths. The scientists examined 20 climate models to simulate major rainfall reorganisation during extreme El Niño events.

"A new blood test could predict who will suffer from arthritis before it hits, allowing for early treatment to stop irreparable damage being done. British scientists hope the test could be available within five years - signifying hope for sufferers and potentially saving the NHS millions in expensive joint replacements. Teams from Bristol University have identified two biomarkers - or indicators in the blood - which  could help distinguish between a healthy person and one with osteoarthritis, a move which they hope would then help them identify which patients' condition will worsen. A new blood test could predict who will suffer from arthritis before it hits, allowing for early treatment to stop irreparable damage being done . Osteoarthritis affects more than eight million people in the UK and the damage it causes costs the NHS £5.2billion a year in treatment. A major cause of pain and disability, it's caused by wear and tear on the joints, specifically the cartilage. Osteoarthritis affects more than eight million people in the UK and the damage it causes costs the NHS £5.2billion a year in treatment . It also leads to the synovial fluid, a jelly-like substance which is secreted by the membrane that surrounds the joint, becoming thin and less elastic. The condition occurs more frequently in women than men, can sometimes be very painful, making movement and everyday tasks difficult. Researcher Dr Mohammed Sharif of Bristol University told the Express that there was an urgent need to find better indicators of the disease, and that he and his team had identified two which were 'very useful'. The indicators - so called 'biomarkers' - are found in the blood. He said: 'We hope to find out whether they can reliably distinguish between a healthy person and a person with osteoarthritis, identify which patients’ condition will get worse, and whether a particular drug is working or not.' The Bristol University team has now been handed £300,000 by medical research charity Arthritis Research UK. They will use the money to investigate if the biomarkers can be used for diagnosis and also to inform doctors if a patient's condition is likely to worsen over time.","Scientists have identified two biomarkers - or indicators in the blood .

"Sgt Bowe Bergdahl has been pictured for the first time since his return to the U.S. in a photo released Wednesday by his attorney, as Army investigators interview the former Taliban prisoner about his five years as a hostage. Sitting behind a desk, wearing civilian clothing and with a few added pounds, Bergdahl looks a world away from the waif he was last May, when pictures showed Taliban associates handing him over in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay prisoners. The U.S. Army began questioning Sgt Bergdahl today about his 2009 disappearance in Afghanistan that led to his capture by the terrorist group, his attorney and an Army spokeswoman said. Scroll down for videos . Bowe Bergdahl is pictured for the first time since he returned from Taliban captivity, in this photo taken as he prepared for a Wednesday interview with Army investigators . Telling his side of the story: The pictures released Wednesday show Bergdahl as he prepares for his interview with Army investigators . Bergdahl was questioned at Fort Sam . Houston in San Antonio, where he has been staying since returning to the . U.S., said his attorney, Eugene R. Fidell. 'Sgt. Bergdahl answered all questions put to him. The interview is . proceeding. It has been a productive expenditure of time,' Fidell said . in a telephone interview during a break in the questioning. Fidell . declined to comment on what specific questions Bergdahl was asked. Lt Col Alayne Conway, an Army spokeswoman, said Bergdahl was advised of his rights under Article 31 of the Uniform Code of Military Justice. Article 31 pertains to individuals being informed of the nature of the accusation against them and says that they do not have to make any statement to investigators. Investigator: Major General Kenneth Dahl, pictured, is leading the interview with Bergdahl. He was appointed to head up the AR 15-6 investigation into the circumstances leading up to Bergdahl's captivity . 'This in an ongoing investigation; the investigating officer has 60 days from his appointment to conclude his investigation; however, he can request additional time if he feels it is necessary,' Conway said in an emailed statement. She did not respond to an inquiry about what type of questions investigators asked. Maj. Gen. Kenneth R. Dahl, who is heading the probe into the 28-year-old's disappearance, questioned Bergdahl on Wednesday, Fidell said. A well-known lawyer and military justice expert who is currently a visiting lecturer at Yale Law School, Fidell described the setting of Bergdahl's interview as 'a comfortable environment,' a room with a sofa and a couple of chairs. He said there were four people in the room, the interview was being recorded and that they were taking breaks throughout the day. Deserter? Bergdahl disappeared while stationed in Afghanistan in 2009 and some of the former members of his unit have claimed he deserted . Fidell said he expected this would be the only interview Bergdahl would be giving as part of the investigation. 'There is no reason to think there will be more than one,' he said. The Idaho native was freed by the Taliban May 31 in a deal struck by the Obama administration in which five senior Taliban officials were released from detention at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Bergdahl had disappeared from his post in Paktika province in eastern Afghanistan on June 30, 2009. Some ex-members of Bergdahl's former unit have labeled him a deserter, asserting that he chose to walk away and saying some were wounded or killed looking for him. Bergdahl as hostage: During his five years in captivity, the Taliban occasionally released videos of their prisoner. Pictured above in December 2010 . The investigation's findings will help determine whether Bergdahl is prosecuted for desertion or faces any other disciplinary action. Bergdahl had been receiving care at Fort Sam Houston since returning to the United States on June 13. He was treated at Brooke Army Medical Center at the fort but was later shifted to outpatient care at the military base. Earlier this month, the Army announced Bergdahl had been given a desk job, ending the formal phase of his transition from Taliban prisoner to not-quite-ordinary soldier. Bergdahl has not commented publicly on the circumstances of his disappearance, and the Army has made no charges against him. It is unknown if Bergdahl's family has seen him since his return to the United States. Army officials have said because of a request by Bergdahl's family for privacy, they cannot comment on that matter.","Bowe Berghdal's attorney has released the first picture of the Army sergeant since his return from five years in Taliban captivity .

"A descendant of the founder of the billion-dollar oil company Halliburton, was found dead in a bathtub at her Florida mansion this week and now police are diving in the canal behind the house - searching for clues in the mysterious homicide. The body of 59-year-old Jill Halliburton Su was found Monday by her oldest son, who was sent to check up on the house when her husband couldn't access the home's surveillance cameras at work. Mrs Su's son called police when he found the body, saying he thought it was a suicide. But when authorities arrived on the scene they started investigating the death as a homicide, since the home's back door near the pool was broken and a room had  been ransacked, indicating a break in. She was the grand-niece of Halliburton Oil Co founder Erle P Halliburton. Her father Louis Halliburton worked for his uncle Erle at the oil business for a few years after fighting in World War II. Louis died last year at the age of 88. Scroll down for video . Mystery: Jill Halliburton Su (right) was found dead Monday at her upscale home in Davie, Florida. Her eldest son found her body after husband Nan-Yao Su (left) couldn't access their home's security camera footage at work and asked him to go check on the house . Homicide: The son originally reported his mother's death to police as a suicide, but when authorities arrived on the scene, they found evidence of foul play. Above, an aerial view of the Su home . They have not yet released any information on the details of how Su died. Police interviewed both Su's son, and her husband, prominent University of Florida Professor Nan-Yao Su, an expert in entomology, the study of insects. Neither have been named as suspects in Su's death but investigators point out that no one has been ruled out yet. 'I don’t want to say anybody’s been ruled out as a suspect. At this time, this is a very active investigation,' Davie Police Captain Dale Engle told ABC News. 'We did find a door that was broken or the glass of a door that was broken.' Covered: Investigators spent Tuesday and Wednesday diving in the canal behind the home, searching for possible evidence . On Tuesday and Wednesday, investigators conducted dives of the canals behind the property, looking for evidence that might illuminate how Su was killed. 'We don’t want to get into specifics of what they are looking for but we do think there is evidence connected to the crime,' Engle told CBS. Police are also canvassing the neighborhood and asking any residents of the gated community to submit any surveillance footage from security cameras. Su worked as a volunteer reading books for the blind at the Fort Lauderdale organization Insight for the Blind. 'She was so popular with everyone and would do whatever was needed either reading or monitoring recordings,' said Insight's Executive Director Mathew Corey.

"President Obama was heckled on Thursday during a fund-raising speech in San Jose, California as he spoke to supporters about the need to cast their vote to ensure the Senate remains in Democratic control. Reaching the end of his address to tech leaders, Obama was interrupted by a man in the crowd and without missing a step, told him that he should speak to him later because he was 'screwing up the end of my speech.' The heckler was excitedly shouting about the freedoms of Ethiopians who he claimed live under a cruel regime backed by the US, to which the president replied he completely agreed, 'although, why don't we talk about it later because I am just about to finish, you and me, we'll talk about it.' Scroll Down for Video . Let me finish: The president responds to his heckler, asking him to quieten down so he can finish his speech . Undeterred and seemingly uninterested in the president's offer, the heckler continued to throw the president off, who shot back about how much he 'wanted to hear' from him. In one amusing aside, the president, keen to complete his final message, told the man that despite his rude interruption, 'I love you back.' The president then finished up by telling the heckler that he was keen to finish but that he 'kinda screwed up my ending.' Addressing the tech leaders, the president warned his supporters to dig deep in their wallets to fund Democratic candidates and feel a sense of urgency about congressional elections in November or risk further gridlock in Washington and a failure to move on their priorities. Love you back: The president said he was more than happy to speak to the heckler afterwards - but he was disappointed to be thrown off the end of his address . Obama was the headline speaker at four California fund-raising events, raising his two-day total to five. His last was a Silicon Valley event in San Jose co-hosted by Y Combinator President Sam Altman and Yahoo Inc CEO Marissa Mayer. About 250 people paid between $1,000 and $32,400 to attend. During his remarks, Obama struck at the heart of the issue that Republicans are using against Democrats in their campaigns: The Affordable Care Act, the Obamacare law whose troubled rollout has given Obama's political opponents much grist for criticism. Republicans have mounted a strong effort to seize control of the Senate from Democrats and are also trying to build on their majority in the House of Representatives. Obama said the effort must be stopped in order to prevent more gridlock in Washington. 'The reason that we've got gridlock right now is because you've got a party that's been captured by folks who are on the wrong side of the issues,' he said. Free speech: A man shouts at President Barack Obama as Obama speaks at a Democratic National Committee reception in San Jose, California on Thursday . Obama, whose own job approval rating under 50 percent is weighing down Democratic prospects in November, said Republicans offer nothing more than their vow to repeal the healthcare law. 'If that's all they've got, then they shouldn't be running either chamber, They shouldn't be running the House. And they sure shouldn't be running the Senate,' he said. The tech industry has raised questions about the scale of the National Security Agency's surveillance under the Obama administration, but there's little sign that Obama is losing support in Silicon Valley. Obama made no mention of these concerns in his luncheon speech attended by 65 guests who paid up to $32,400 per couple for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Obama told them that majorities of Americans support the direction that Democrats want to take the country, such as on raising the minimum wage and making sure women receive equal pay as men, but that they have 'lost faith that we can actually make it happen' because of Washington gridlock. Great start: U.S. President Barack Obama is introduced to speak by Yahoo CEO Marissa Mayer at a DNC fund raiser in San Jose, California . Important message: President Barack Obama speaks at a Democratic National Committee reception in San Jose, before he was heckled . Obama needs Democrats to do well in November to allow him to advance his agenda in his last two years in office, in 2015 and 2016. But most political analysts believe Republicans will build on their House majority and stand a decent chance of winning the Senate. Obama has been using fund-raising speeches to warn of this outcome, saying Democrats need to avoid getting distracted by media attention on the 2016 presidential election to choose a successor to him. Obama said in La Jolla that Democrats need to gain seats 'in order for us to not simply play defense but to actually go back on the offensive for the American people.'","President interrupted during address to tech-leaders in San Jose, California on Thursday .

"Benefits will be stripped from the long-term jobless unless they work full time picking up litter, removing graffiti or preparing meals for the elderly. George Osborne will today announce details of the US-style ‘work for the dole’ programme, starting within six months and affecting 200,000 welfare claimants. Revealed by the Mail last week, the £300million scheme ends the concept of simply ‘signing on’, the Chancellor will tell the Tory party conference. Crackdown: Chancellor George Osborne insisted this 'no option of doing nothing for your benefits' New policy: Around 200,000 unemployed people claiming jobseeker's allowance in the UK will be affected by a new Tory 'work for your dole' scheme . And he will accuse Labour of allowing people to linger on benefits for years – with no questions asked – while letting uncontrolled numbers of migrants fill low-paid jobs. Speaking on ITV's Daybreak ahead of his speech, Mr Osborne said: 'From now on, people are going to have to do something in return for those benefits. 'These are people who have been unemployed for three years, and we’re saying in return for that you’ve either got to do some work in your community like cleaning the graffiti up or cooking meals for the elderly or you’ve got to be signing on every day at the Jobcentre, or you need to be getting real help with some of, perhaps, your underlying problems like a drug problem or illiteracy. 'So we’re saying there’s no option of doing nothing for your benefits. No something for nothing anymore. 'People are going to have to do things to get their dole and that is going to help them into work – that is the crucial point. This is all activity that is actually going to help them get ready for the world of work.' Mr Osborne’s announcement is the centrepiece of the second day of the Manchester conference. In other key developments: . The ‘Help to Work’ scheme – quickly dubbed ‘Made to Work’ – is likely to face furious opposition from left-wing activists and charities. Workfare: The new benefits rule is the centrepiece of Mr Osborne's speech at the Tory party conference in Manchester . But Mr Osborne will tell Tory delegates: . ‘For the first time, all long-term unemployed people who are capable of . work will be required to do something in return for their benefits to . help them find work. ‘They will do useful work to put . something back into their community – making meals for the elderly, . clearing up litter, working for a local charity. Others will be made to . attend the job centre every working day. ‘And for those with underlying problems, like drug addiction and illiteracy, there will be an intensive regime of help. No one will be ignored or left without help. But no one will get something for nothing.’ The Liberal Democrats have agreed that the scheme, which is larger than expected, should begin next April – confirming welfare as a major election issue. Around 200,000 jobseeker’s allowance claimants will be affected each year. Mr Osborne will also use his speech to the conference to warn that ‘many risks remain’ to the economic recovery. He will argue that what matters most for living standards are ‘jobs, and low mortgage rates, and lower taxes’ – an implied rebuke to Labour leader Ed Miliband’s proposal to use 1970s-style laws to fix energy prices. But the Chancellor will warn that family finances will ‘not be transformed overnight’ because Britain was made ‘much poorer’ by the economic crash of 2007 and 2008. At the conference: The announcement comes after David Cameron revealed the Help to Buy mortgage scheme is being brought forward to next week . And he will argue that it is crucial . for Britain’s future economic health that the long-term unemployed no . longer have ‘a life on the dole’. The . £300million Help to Work scheme, the Chancellor will say, will be . funded from spending cuts and savings elsewhere, to be detailed in the . autumn statement. A slimline Michael Gove yesterday denied he is shaping up for a leadership battle. The Education Secretary, who has been to a ‘fat farm’ in Austria, insisted he was an ‘inconceivable choice’ to head the Tories and would in no circumstances put himself forward. ‘I don’t want to do it, I wouldn’t do it,’ he said. ‘It wouldn’t matter how many people asked me to do it – I don’t think there would be very many.’ In the unlikely event that he is suddenly ‘possessed of the idea’, he said: ‘Those who know me best of all would try to stop me. Absolutely no.’ Mr Gove, a close ally of David Cameron and often tipped as a future leader, unveiled his new look at the party conference. His spell at the £2,500-a-week health spa saw him lose a reported two stone from his 15-stone starting point. At the clinic on the shores of Lake Worthersee, popular with Liz Hurley and the Duchess of York, he was restricted to 600 calories a day and denied caffeine and alcohol.

Claimants put on community work . placements will have to do 30 hours a week for six months, plus ten . hours of job search activity a week, and show they are doing ‘everything . they can’ to find paid work. Placements will have to be of wider benefit to the community as well as the individual claimant. Those . who break the rules will lose four weeks of benefits for their first . breach of the rules, and a quarter of a year’s worth for any second . offence. ‘By the time . Labour left office, five million people were on out-of-work benefits. 'What a waste of life and talent,’ Mr Osborne will say. ‘A generation of people recycled through the job centres – collecting their dole cheques year in year out, and no one seemed to notice. 'For an open-door immigration policy meant those running the economy didn’t care: there was always a ready supply of low-skilled labour from abroad. Well, never again.’ The Chancellor will argue that, under Labour’s welfare system, people were better off on benefits than in work and nothing was asked for in return for handouts. Rachel Reeves, Labour’s Treasury spokesman, said: ‘It’s taken three wasted years of rising long-term unemployment and a failed Work Programme to come up with this new scheme. ‘But this policy is not as ambitious as Labour’s compulsory jobs guarantee, which would ensure there is a paid job for every young person out of work for over 12 months and every adult unemployed for more than two years. ‘With Labour’s plans we would work with employers to ensure there are jobs for young people and the long-term unemployed – which they would have to take up or lose benefits. 'Under the Tory scheme people would still be allowed to languish on the dole for years on end without having a proper job.’ The Conservatives will not accept the introduction of a ‘mansion tax’ as the price of another power-sharing deal with the Liberal Democrats. David Cameron took the unusual step of revealing that he considers the proposal a ‘red line’ and will never bring it in as long as he remains Prime Minister. The only other issue he has indicated would be a deal-breaker in a future coalition is a referendum on Europe. Red line': Prime Minister David Cameron today told The Andrew Marr Show the Conservatives will not introduce a mansion tax . The Prime Minister said a tax on expensive homes was ‘not a good idea’, insisting wealth taxes were ‘not sensible’ for a country that wants to attract entrepreneurs. New statistics released by the Treasury show that the richest are already contributing more income tax now than under Labour. The richest 0.1 per cent – people on more than £160,000 – will contribute 14.1 per cent of total income tax this year – up 22 per cent on the previous 12 months. A mansion tax – a long-term demand of the Lib Dems –  would see a one per cent levy placed on a property’s value above £2million. ‘I don’t think this is a good idea,’ Mr Cameron told the BBC’s Andrew Marr show. ‘It’s right people pay council tax, it’s right people pay stamp duty, we’ve put that up, it’s right people pay a decent top rate of tax, that’s 45p in the pound in this country. But to go after someone’s house every year with a wealth tax, I don’t think that is a sensible thing to do.’","George Osborne will announce the £300m 'work for the dole' scheme today .

"A teenager died following a violent fit that struck her just 20 minutes after she coloured her hair. Tabatha McCourt, 17, began pulling at her shoulder-length locks, screaming and vomiting before collapsing in agony at a friend’s house. Medics are investigating the possibility that she had a rare allergic reaction to a chemical in the dye. Died: Tabatha McCourt collapsed looking like a 'rag doll' minutes after dyeing her hair last month . Her best friend Heather Goodhall said they had been enjoying a ‘girlie’ night watching the X Factor before the tragedy on Saturday. ‘Tabatha was always dyeing her hair different colours,’ said Heather. ‘The dye had only been in around 20 minutes when she got up and went to the bathroom. ‘She came back a couple of minutes later, sat down on the seat, and then began frantically pulling the foils from her hair. ‘She started shouting, “no, no” and my mum’s boyfriend held her and tried to calm her down. It was really scary. ‘Her eyes started going all funny and then she just started being sick. She looked just like a rag doll, limp, just lying there.’ Tributes: Balloons and flowers are placed outside Tabatha McCourt's home. Police said her death is unexplained . Tragedy: More tributes outside Tabatha's home. Her best friend Heather Goodhall called 999 but paramedics who came to the house were unable to save her . Tabatha was taken to Monklands General Hospital, Lanarkshire, following the incident in Airdrie, but she later died. A tearful Heather added: ‘It all seems like it’s not real. ‘Tabatha was a great friend, so generous and full of life, always hyper and bubbly. Tabatha's best friend Heather Goodhall said they had been enjoying a 'girlie' night before the tragedy . ‘She had the biggest heart and was a really lovely person. ‘We were planning to have a joint 18th birthday party next year. I can’t believe she is gone.’ Tabatha lived with her parents Margaret and Peter and sisters Tiffany, 15, and Jasmine, 11. Her youngest sister posted on Facebook: ‘RIP big sister. I know you are gone but you will always be in my heart. Love you so much xx.’ Friends and relatives have piled notes and floral tributes at the family’s home in Airdrie. Police said the death was unexplained and a post-mortem examination would be carried out. A chemical called p-Phenylenediamine has reportedly been suggested as a possible cause for the sudden reaction. Emma Meredith, head of scientific research at the Cosmetic Toiletry and Perfumery Association, explained it is used in many dyes that darken hair. ‘To have such an immediate and violent reaction to this or any other cosmetic product is exceedingly rare,’ she said. ‘We don’t know if Tabatha had any predisposition to allergies but any kind of reaction would be more likely in that case. ‘This is an awful and unfortunate event and our thoughts are with Tabatha’s family.’ Miss Meredith urged consumers to check product instructions before use. Many advise doing an allergy test 48 hours before use.","Tabatha McCourt ran screaming from bathroom pulling foils from hair .

"This is the incredible moment a teenager who underwent Turkey's first facial transplant sees his new face for the first time. Ugur Acar, 19, suffered serious burns to his face during a house fire when he was just 40 days old. He had cosmetic procedure to repair his face 23 days ago at Akdeniz University's School of Medicine in the south of the country. Mirror image: Watched by his surgeons, Ugur Acar looks at his face for the first time since he had reconstructive surgery more than three weeks ago . As he was: Mr Acar suffered serious burns to his face during a house fire when he was just 40 days old . Today, he tentatively looked into a mirror to see what surgeons had been able to achieve - and was impressed with the result. He said: 'I give thanks to all my doctors. It couldn't be better.' Mr Acar said he is now dreaming of getting married. His face was freshly shaven before he looked into the mirror as he had been forced to grow a beard over the three weeks since the operation to avoid irritating his skin. However, doctors warned him that he cannot make facial expressions for another six months. Dr Omer Ozkan said: 'Don't do any mimics as nerve healing will take six months. 'You will laugh, cry and get angry after six months, OK?' Doctors successfully transplanted tissue from the face of a 45-year-old donor to Mr Acar. Israfil Kurtcepe, rector of the university hospital, said specialists will be at hand if he needs any support. He said: 'Ugur was prepared for this process, and everything went well. 'He didn't need psychiatric or psychological care. We were just there for him to make sure that he didn't need any psychiatric assistance. 'We will continue to be there for him, and we will help him adopt his new life and talk with him about his personal problems, if there are any.' Mr Acar was forced to grow a beard in the three weeks since the operation to avoid irritating his skin. He was shaved moments before looking in the mirror . Doctors said they are planning to discharge Mr Acar from hospital in 45 days. Last month's surgery brought the number of face transplants carried out worldwide to 20. The first such procedure took place in 2005, when a partial face transplant was carried out on a French woman named Isabelle Dinoire.","Ugur Acar, 19, suffered serious burns to his face during a house fire when he was just 40 days old .

"Winds of change: A turbine . George Osborne is preparing to offer tax breaks to firms hit by Britain’s ‘absurd’ climate change policies after being warned they threaten to drive business abroad. In a major U-turn, the Chancellor will try to help companies that use large amounts of energy. His move comes amid growing concern that companies and households are being hit heavily by Britain’s commitment to cut carbon emissions faster than other countries. Yesterday one of the world’s leading industrialists said manufacturing was being ‘ruinously penalised’ by green taxes and said the levies could put his firm’s £1.2billion investment programme in this country at risk. Karl-Ulrich Kohler, head of Tata Steel Europe – which employs 20,000 staff in Britain – told the Daily Mail: ‘Why the UK government wants to go further and be the leader in Europe in this field is difficult for me to understand. It’s a race for the leadership that is simply over the top. ‘The UK is one of the weaker industrial players in Europe. Why are we trying to be a leader on the green front when the economy is in such a hard place?’ He added: ‘If the UK becomes less attractive due to regulation and tax, then there are other places in the world to invest. The Government must see that.’ Mr Osborne’s plans are sure to set him on collision course with his Liberal Democrat coalition colleagues. Last night Whitehall sources told the Mail the Chancellor is working on radical proposals to mitigate the effects on companies that use large amounts of energy, such as cement, aluminium and steel makers. Tax breaks and exemptions from new carbon levies are expected to be included in a mini-Budget due next month. George Osborne is preparing to offer tax breaks to firms hit by climate change policies (pictured during Conservative conference this month) A source close to Mr Osborne said: ‘We recognise that a decade of environmental laws and regulations have piled costs on the energy bills of energy intensive business. ‘As well as increasing the climate change levy discount on electricity and reducing corporation tax, he will be announcing a package of measures to help energy intensive industries remain competitive in due course. ‘There’s no point forcing energy intensive industries to relocate to other countries – that would only harm our economy without reducing global carbon emissions.’ Last year David Cameron said he wanted the Coalition to be known as the ‘greenest government ever’. And Mr Osborne alarmed industry when he announced a ‘carbon floor price’ in his Budget last March – essentially a tax on emissions that will raise £3.2billion by 2016. Former Conservative Chancellor Lord Lawson, a leading climate change sceptic, said tax breaks for the hardest-hit industries were a good ‘first step’. The current policies are endangering the economy at a particularly difficult time,’ he said. ‘I hope the Chancellor will as soon as possible spell out exactly what he proposes to do to prevent this. ‘The real need is not to have these absurd commitments and then have to run around bribing vulnerable businesses at taxpayers’ expense so as to prevent them from closing down or leaving the country – it is to amend the [emissions] targets. ‘We must make it quite clear that we are not going there if the rest of the world isn’t.’ Under Labour’s Climate Change Act, the Government is legally bound to cut emissions 35 per cent by 2022 and 50 per cent by 2025. But the EU is committed only to cutting emissions 20 per cent by 2020. Several countries are rejecting calls for them to increase the target to 30 per cent. Tory MP David Davis, a former leadership contender, said: ‘George Osborne must stand his ground against the Lib Dems on this issue. ‘There is absolutely no point in having such draconian environmental policies that heavy energy-using industries like steel and chemicals up sticks and go and create just as much pollution in India and China, but to our economic disadvantage. It is simply not a rational policy.’ Energy Secretary Chris Huhne said it was vital for Britain to reduce its dependence on oil and gas imports from ‘volatile’ parts of the world. He said volatility in fossil fuel prices was primarily responsible for pushing up household bills. Ministers’ obsession with green taxes is driving up energy bills, bringing financial pain to millions of families, it was claimed last night. Business groups demanded cuts in fuel prices be given a higher priority than meeting EU targets to reduce carbon emissions. But the Government energy summit yesterday offered no hope that struggling families and businesses will be offered lower energy bills this winter. Both Energy Secretary Chris Huhne and British Gas managing director Phil Bentley admitted that price rises were here to stay. The ‘big six’ energy giants have increased tariffs by 15 per cent-plus in recent weeks, raising the average annual dual fuel bill by around £175 to £1,345. This figure is inflated by around £100 to cover a raft of green taxes and associated charges, which are set to soar in the next decade. Mr Huhne is the chief cheerleader for the charges, which are being used to fund a £200billion shift to wind, wave, solar and nuclear power. Yesterday he insisted that prices in  Britain were ‘relatively good’ compared with elsewhere in the world but admitted: ‘If you are asking me to predict what is going to happen to world fossil fuel prices then the Government’s prediction... is that in the medium-run those prices are going to go up. The companies are not the Salvation Army. We expect them to earn respectable returns for their shareholders.’ Mr Bentley added: ‘In the last two and a half years, gas prices on the international market are up by 70 per cent. I’m afraid it is an inconvenient truth that those costs have to be passed on to customers.’ Mr Huhne said customers should shop around as up to 85 per cent ‘don’t bother’ to look for a better deal. He said: ‘This is not small beer. If you look at the figures on an average dual fuel bill of about £1,300, by switching you can get £200 off.’ But yesterday Simon Walker, the new director general of the Institute of Directors, said it was ‘simply not credible’ for the Government politely to ask energy firms to curb bills. He warned that the current push for green energy is driving up bills, saying: ‘Current policies risk locking us into cleaner and more expensive energy, when the goal should be cleaner and cheaper energy. ‘What may have been tolerable in an age of affluence is far less realistic today. Undermining the UK’s competitiveness through high energy costs would do no favours to either economic recovery or the environment.’ Richard Lloyd, of consumer champion Which?, said: ‘There is a problem here that has got to be fixed. The market does, for consumers, feel rigged against us.’ Ann Robinson, of price comparison website uSwitch, said: ‘I would urge the Government to calculate the full cost that will be passed on to household energy bills and to then think again about the impact.’ Energy industry analyst Dr Craig Lowrey said: ‘I think the summit has come too late in the year to have any effect on bills this winter. This appears to be a cosmetic exercise at least in terms of any immediate impact.’ Steven Fitzpatrick, managing director of OVO energy, said he thought the meeting was ‘disappointingly predictable’, adding: ‘If I was the head of one of the big six I would feel that we had got off very lightly.’","George Osborne will try to help companies that use large amounts of energy .

"Police missed 11 opportunities to save the life of a young mother who was murdered by her violent ex-partner. Casey Brittle, 21, was kicked and punched to death in front of her two-year-old daughter after suffering years of abuse. The little girl walked into the room where her father Sanchez Williams was carrying out the attack and afterwards stayed with her unconscious mother for two hours. Let down: Casey Brittle repeatedly called police before she was murdered by Sanchez Williams in front of her two-year-old daughter . Yesterday, Nottinghamshire Police were savaged for a series of failings by officers. Williams, 27, was known for his . violence and had a long criminal record but police failed to take ‘basic . actions’ to protect Miss Brittle. The force was called 11 times by the . mother herself, neighbours or witnesses, to report attacks or threats . between September 2008 and August 2010. But an independent report found police . never questioned why she repeatedly complained of domestic violence . before they refused help. Prison: Sanchez Williams was jailed for life after he admitted murdering Casey at her home in front of their daughter . Miss Brittle was so scared of her . ex-partner she ‘played down’ the incidents and was reluctant to press . charges. As a result, Williams was never charged with a criminal offence . in relation to her. A neighbour heard her daughter screaming ‘I want my mummy’ as she was attacked at her home in Nottingham in October last year. Miss Brittle died in hospital from 27 . injuries to her head, including a jaw fractured on both sides, caused by . being punched, kicked and stamped on. In March, Williams was jailed for life with a minimum of 15 years after admitting murder. The report by the Independent Police . Complaints Commission said the force did not have a domestic abuse . policy for most of the period of her ordeal and officers repeatedly . failed to intervene effectively, with many ‘unclear about what to do’. It said key paperwork was not . submitted, a domestic abuse unit was left in the dark, procedures were . not understood and bail conditions were not imposed on Williams to keep . him away. Attack: Nottingham Crown Court where Sanchez was jailed for life in March. Ms Brittle died from a series of injuries to her head, including a fractured jaw, cuts and bruising at her home in October last year . The IPCC investigation found failures by officers in individual incidents, which included:1. A lack of understanding of the force's domestic abuse policy and procedures . 2. Not submitting risk assessment forms to the domestic abuse unit . 3. A lack of positive action against Williams or following lines of enquiry . 4. Bail conditions preventing contact with Casey not being imposed on Williams . 5. Incidents were not given the appropriate coding or entered on the crime recording system that would have given colleagues a better chance of assessing the risk posed to Casey . In June 2010, Williams threw Miss . Brittle into a changing room at the shop where she worked. She emerged . shaken with red marks on her neck. But there was no CCTV of the attack . and police inquiries were dropped. In August 2010, he head-butted her and . threw her into a shopping mall photo booth. She refused to press . charges and an inexperienced officer did not arrest him. Six officers have been disciplined and four reprimanded. Last night, Miss Brittle’s mother . Victoria Blower said: ‘Mistakes were made, but there is only one person . responsible for my daughter’s death and that is Williams. ‘Maybe one small change in the way . things were handled could have saved her, or maybe nothing was ever . going to prevent him murdering Casey.’ Chief Constable Paul Broadbent said: ‘We could and should have done more.

"It’s a serious bruise - and this protester claims it was caused by a policeman shooting a rubber bullet at him as he rushed to help an injured Iraq war veteran during this week’s Occupy Oakland protests. Shamus Collins showed off his bruise to other protesters yesterday at the demonstrators’ new camp - and it is clear evidence to suggest the police did fire rubber bullets, despite their consistent denials. He rushed to the aid of former Marine Scott Olsen, 24, who was left in a critical condition after being hit by a projectile believed to have been thrown by police on Tuesday at the California protests. Bruise: Occupy Oakland protester Shamus Collins claims he was shot with a rubber bullet as he went to the aid of injured Iraq war veteran Scott Olsen at a new encampment in Frank H. Ogawa Plaza in Oakland, California . Mr Olsen, who won medals in Iraq, has become a rallying cry for the Occupy Wall Street movement across the U.S. - and the picture of Mr Collins at Frank H. Ogawa Plaza will only heighten their anger. Officials are investigating exactly where the projectile that hit Mr Olsen came from, but police have denied using rubber bullets to calm the protests - although admitted firing bean bags. However two other protesters suggested rubber bullets were used, reported the Washington Post. Jen Lasher posted a picture on Twitter showing a bruise that looks like it was caused by a rubber bullet - and Schuyler Erle tweeted a photo of what he claimed was a rubber bullet found in Oakland. His story: Mr Collins explains to others how he remembers being shot with a rubber bullet earlier this week . Meanwhile, a crowd of 1,000 people, many holding candles, gathered on Thursday night in Oakland to hold a vigil in honour of Mr Olsen, who is hospitalised with a fractured skull. Twitter users and protest websites have been declaring since the incident: ‘We are all Scott Olsen.’ Joshua Shepherd, 27, a Navy veteran who was standing nearby when Mr Olsen got struck, called it a cruel irony that he is fighting an injury in the country that he fought to protect. Despite the financial underpinnings of the protests, Mr Olsen himself wasn't taking part out of economic need. His friends say he makes a good living as a network engineer. Tribute: A couple light candles at a vigil in support of Scott Olsen at City Hall in Oakland on Thursday . He is said to have an apartment overlooking San Francisco Bay, but felt so strongly about economic inequality in the U.S. that he fought for overseas that he slept at a protest camp after work. ‘He felt you shouldn't wait until something is affecting you to get out and do something about it,’ said his friend and roommate Keith Shannon, who served with Mr Olsen in Iraq. Mr Olsen’s condition has been improving. Doctors transferred him from the emergency room to  intensive care and upgraded his condition to fair. He has since been described as 'awake and lucid' By Thursday afternoon, he was interacting with his parents, who flew in from Wisconsin in the morning - doing maths equations and meeting Mayor Jean Quan, who stopped by to apologise. Badly-injured: The Occupy Oakland protesters, a part of the Occupy Wall Street movement, carry away Mr Olsen after he was hit by a tear gas canister shot by police, near the Oakland City Hall on Tuesday . Marine: Mr Olsen, second right, and friend Keith Shannon, second left, are shown on a cargo plane leaving Iraq . His uncle said Mr Olsen's mother was trying to understand what had happened. ‘This is obviously a heartbreaker to her,’ George Nygaard said. ‘I don't think she understands why he was doing this.’ The group Iraq Veterans Against the War blamed police for Mr Olsen's injury. Oakland Police Chief Howard Jordan said officials will investigate whether officers used excessive force. Police have said they responded with tear gas and bean bag rounds only when protesters began throwing bottles and other items at them. Mr Olsen was awarded seven medals while serving in the U.S. Marine Corps, which he left as a lance corporal in November 2009 after serving for four years. He moved to the Bay Area in July.","Ex-Marine Scott Olsen now awake after being hit by projectile on Tuesday .

"The death toll in the battle for Cairo’s Tahrir Square rose to 33 yesterday as fighting between protesters and the police escalated sharply. Police fired tear-gas and plastic bullets as demonstrators calling for Egypt’s army rulers to quit hurled stones and rocks from behind makeshift barricades. Many of those who died succumbed to bullet wounds, but although protesters have brandished bullet casings, police deny using live ammunition. It was the third consecutive day of street battles which have left more than 1,700 people injured and threaten to spiral out of control. Enlarge . For young and old: At both ends of the protest spectrum, a young man throws a rock at riot police, above left, while a bearded older man wears goggles and a surgical mask to protect himself against tear gas attack . Last night thousands of protesters remained packed into the symbolic square where demonstrations helped topple detested leader President Hosni Mubarak in February. A military council has held power since then, but protesters are demanding that it hands over to a civilian government. Parliamentary elections are due to begin next week, but the protesters want the military out immediately. They accuse the generals of acting in the same autocratic way as Mubarak’s regime and fear they will dominate the coming government just as they have the interim one they appointed in March. Yesterday that government, under prime minister Essam Sharaf, submitted its resignation to the military council, but is to stay on until a decision on a handover is made. Foreign Secretary William Hague told the Today programme on Radio 4 that the  military should remain in charge to oversee the elections, but there should then be ‘the speediest possible transition to civilian  democratic rule’. Extensive damage: Smashed windows, burning buildings and streets strewn with debris are a common sight in the streets surrounding Tahrir Square as violence continues . Little cover: Demonstrators hide behind a makeshift shield as security forces - on foot and in riot vehicles - approach their position. Doctors are reporting seeing around 80 casualties an hour . Sustained attack: Protesters flee from tear gas fired by riot police, during clashes at a road that leads to the Interior Ministry, near Tahrir Square . The military says it will hand over power only after presidential elections, which it has vaguely said will be held in late 2012 or early 2013. Mr Hague said the deaths and injuries were ‘of great concern’, but dismissed claims that the violence undermined hopes that the ‘Arab Spring’ wave of protests in the region would usher in more democratic governments. Protesters battled with police throughout yesterday, hurling stones and firebombs and throwing back the tear-gas canisters being fired by police into the square. Scroll down for footage of Tahrir Square clashes . Before the dawn: Tahrir Square, centre of the Egyptian revolution and now the focus of renewed demonstrations. At least 22 protesters have been killed and more than 1,700 injured . Daylight: Riot police have largely secured the square today, but confrontation between protesters and police is continuing in surrounding streets . Time for prayer: Showing the level of unity among protesters, Coptic Christians stand guard as their Muslim comrades pray in a respite in clashes with the armed forces in the square . A constant stream of injured protesters – bloodied from rubber bullets or overcome by gas – were brought into makeshift clinics set out on pavements around the square where volunteer doctors scrambled from patient to patient. Police attacked one of the clinics, but were driven back by protesters hurling chunks of concrete from smashed pavements. Internet clips showed police beating protesters with sticks, pulling them by the hair and, in one case, dumping what looked like a body on a rubbish heap. ‘The people had a revolution to live a . better life, but look at everything,’ said protester FayezMohammed, his . eyes streaming from tear-gas. Islamists, who expect to do well in the elections and suspect the army . wants to curtail their influence, dominated the demonstrations.

Not confined to the square: A protester stands in a burning building in Cairo this morning - one of many buildings damaged during overnight fighting . A protester is treated after being hit in the eye, while a field hospital staff member holds spent ammunition collected by protesters. Security forces have used rubber bullets and live rounds during the clashes . Analysts say Islamists could win 40 per cent of assembly seats, with many going to the influential Muslim Brotherhood. Renewed . violence in Egypt should not dampen optimism about the so-called Arab . Spring, Foreign Secretary William Hague said today. He . said the military should remain in charge to oversee elections, due to . begin next week, but they should be followed by 'the speediest possible . transition to civilian democratic rule'. He . also called on the military to end the present state of emergency, . release detained protesters and take action to boost the economy. He . said: 'It is very important that elections take place and that then . there is the speediest possible transition to civilian democratic rule . in Egypt. There are many things the military rulers in Egypt need to . do.' The . deaths and injuries were 'of great concern', he said, but he insisted . it did not undermine hopes that the wave of protests in the region would . usher in more democratic governments. But the weekend unrest drew in many other protesters, including young activists who helped topple Mubarak. Army generals were feted for their part in easing him out, but hostility to their rule has hardened, especially over attempts to set new constitutional principles that would keep the military permanently beyond civilian control. The army says the polls beginning on Monday will go ahead, but the unrest could deter voters in the capital. Some Egyptians believe the army council may be stirring insecurity to prolong its rule, a charge it denies. Protesters also marched yesterday in . other cities, including Alexandria where thousands of students called . for those responsible for the violence in Cairo to be punished. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office . has no current travel restrictions in place for Britons travelling to . Egypt, but it strongly advises them to stay away from Tahrir Square and . the downtown area of Cairo and to avoid all crowds and demonstrations. Visitors are also advised to stay away from polling stations which could become flash points during the elections. The FCO website says: ‘The situation . is changing rapidly and we recommend that you follow events on local and . international news and seek advice from tour operators.’ Overview: Protesters use wooden boards as shields as tear gas is fired by riot police near the Interior Ministry . Loaded: Police officers with shotguns face in all directions during the violence. The weapons fire rubber bullets, which are described as 'non-lethal' projectiles but can inflict serious injury .

"MPs who received thousands of pounds worth of hospitality from one of the world’s largest tobacco companies opposed a new law banning smoking in cars. The parliamentary register of members’ interests shows Japan Tobacco International, which produces Benson & Hedges, Silk Cut and Camel cigarettes, spent £23,000 entertaining 20 MPs in the past six months. Almost half of them voted against a Private Member’s Bill banning smoking in cars carrying children. Conservative MP Richard Ottaway was amongst those who profited from Tobacco firms' generosity . Michael Ellis and Alun Cairns (right) accepted gifts from Tobacco firms in order to generate interest in smoking laws . The MP behind the Bill, Labour’s Alex Cunningham, has asked Parliamentary Standards Commissioner John Lyon to investigate. In May, seven Tory MPs accepted tickets from JTI to the Chelsea Flower Show, costing at least £1,100 each for themselves plus a guest. Less than a month later they voted against the Bill, which passed the first stage of the parliamentary process by 78 votes to 66 on June 22. The seven were Therese Coffey, Richard . Ottaway, Christopher Pincher, Alun Cairns, Stephen Metcalfe, Laurence . Robertson and Michael Ellis. Conservative MP Laurence Robertson (left) and Therese Coffey enjoyed benefits laid on for fellow MPs by Tobacco firms . In August Labour MP Simon Danczuk and Tory Andrew Rosindell watched the England versus India Test match at the Oval courtesy of JTI. They had also voted against the anti-smoking Bill. Mr Danczuk received hospitality to the value of £1,389 and Mr Rosindell was given £1,447 worth. Both attended the game with a guest. The MP behind the bill – Labour’s Alex Cunningham – is now demanding an investigation by John Lyon the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner. MPs Christopher Pincher (left) and Stephen Metcalfe also enjoyed the luxuries . Mr Cunningham said: ‘I’m really quite amazed that MPs would put themselves in such a vulnerable position by taking this stand on proposed legislation around the same time they were receiving such lavish entertainment from the tobacco industry. ‘I’ve asked John Lyon to look into it.’ The tobacco industry fears Mr Cunningham’s bill could be the first step in a total ban on smoking in cars, seriously affecting its profits. It is keen to lobby MPs to limit new regulations from the health campaigners that have already led to a ban on smoking in public places. In May, seven MPs, all Conservatives, accepted tickets from Japan Tobacco International to the Chelsea Flower Show costing £1,132 for themselves plus a guest. They were also given lunch at the horticultural event. Less than a month later they voted against the anti-smoking Bill which passed the first of the Parliamentary process by 78 votes to 66. Between them, the nine MPs who voted against the Bill were treated to £10,778 of entertainment by JTI. Mr Cunningham’s Private Members Bill is due to be voted on again on Friday. Concerned: Prime Minister David Cameron is aware of over scandals that could break from lobbying . Very few Private Member’s Bills become law but they stimulate debate and can lead to more powerful legislative efforts. The Department of Health is already planning a publicity campaign next spring warning of the dangers of smoking in cars and at home. Existing rules on lobbying make clear that MPs must not place themselves under any financial obligation to outside individuals or organisations and must not act as a paid advocate in any parliamentary proceedings. They should not take payment to speak in Parliament, to vote a certain way, to introduce legislation, to amend legislation or to urge others to do so. The lobbying industry is under increasing pressure after the resignation of former Defence Secretary Dr Liam Fox over his relationship with friend Adam Werritty. But the Prime Minister has delayed plans to introduce a statutory register of lobbyists despite warning last February that: 'lobbying was the next big scandal waiting to happen.' Sir Alistair Graham, the former chairman of the committee on standards in public life, said: ‘It is odd that these MPs are so keen to genuflect towards the tobacco industry and worrying that they are so easily accessible to it. ‘Given David Cameron’s very strong words about lobbying being the next scandal to hit the political class you would think that MPs would be more cautious in their approach.’ A spokesman for JTI said: ‘Like other businesses or bodies, we invite politicians and their parliamentary staff to our events, and this exchange of views has helped bring more balance to an otherwise one-sided debate.’","Japan Tobacco International spent £23,000 entertaining 20 MPs in six months .

"Gloomy prediction: Jacques Attali says the euro has a 'one in two' chance of collapsing in the coming month . Britain was last night planning for the collapse of the eurozone as Spain weighed up a bailout that could cost UK taxpayers £5billion. The Government is preparing for the biggest mass default in history and the break-up of the single currency bloc. Analysts warned that euro meltdown would wreak havoc in the banking system and plunge the global economy back into recession. Whitehall sources said contingency plans are being drawn up – and indicated that the longer the euro limps on, the more time Britain has to prepare. Fears are mounting that Greece will be forced to default on its debts as the crisis threatens to sink Spain and Italy. The storm hit Belgium last night as the country’s credit rating was cut from AA+ to AA by Standard & Poor’s amid tumbling confidence in the region. And a leading French economist, Jacques Attali, the former president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, said there was only a 50-50 chance of the euro surviving until Christmas. Sources in Madrid said the new Spanish government is considering applying for international aid to shore up its battered finances. It is thought a bailout of around £340billion would be required to keep the country afloat – with as much as £5billion coming from Britain through the International Monetary Fund. The long-term debt ratings for the eurozone, the U.S. and Japan . United Kingdom                    2.22% . France                                  3.71% .

Borrowing costs in Italy raced to record highs as the new government in Rome was hammered on the financial markets. In a move that raises the pressure on . Italian prime minister Mario Monti, investors demanded a punitive 6.5 . per cent interest rate on a short-term loan. ‘The pricing is awful,’ said Padhraic Garvey, an analyst at ING bank. Benchmark borrowing costs in Italy soared above 7 per cent – the level which triggered bailouts in Greece, Portugal and Ireland. The alarming developments in Spain and Italy threaten to cripple the eurozone. Credit rating agencies have warned . that France’s coveted AAA debt score is under threat. Germany was rocked . this week by the worst bond auction since the launch of the single . currency more than a decade ago. Investors bought only 60 per cent of . debt on offer from Berlin in a sign that the crisis is spreading to the . core of the eurozone. The debt storm has triggered panic in Britain and America amid fears that it will tip the global economy into recession. The euro fell nearly 1 per cent . against the U.S. dollar to little more than $1.32 and was down half a . per cent against sterling, making a euro worth 85.6p. Brendan McGrath, a senior analyst at .

"Making a gun salute with his fingers, . this is the teenager stabbed to death in front of Boxing Day shoppers . after a feud between rival gangs erupted in London’s West End. Seydou Diarrassouba, 18, was knifed in the heart after a fight broke . out between two groups in a trainer store on a packed Oxford Street.

Just hours later, a second man aged 21 was stabbed in the leg on the . same street in what is believed to be a separate and unrelated attack.

"The Marines who died in a helicopter crash during routine training included an expectant father, a father of two who was a former pastor and an experienced pilot preparing for his fifth tour of duty. The names of the four other men who perished in one of the deadliest training accidents for years have not yet been released. Crews have been working for two days to clean up the accident site on a sprawling desert range near Yuma, Arizona. Victims: Lance Corporal Corey Little, pictured left with his wife Nicole, and Sergeant Justin Everett, right, died in a helicopter crash this week . 'He died doing what he loved': Thomas Budrejko's family has paid tribute to the fallen Marine . Among the dead was 25-year-old Lance Corporal Corey Little, of Fayetteville, Georgia. Mr Little was also a Huey helicopter crew chief and he was expecting his first child with his wife Nicole in September. Nicole Little described him as 'the best husband in the world', and added that he would 'always be there through the child', according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Mr Little's brother Nickolas also paid tribute to the 'great and loving' Marine - and said that he too planned to join the corps, 'not only for myself but also to honour my brother'. 'He loved the outdoors,' Mr Little's mother said. 'He loved to read. He was a very avid reader.' Another victim was 33-year-old Sergeant Justin Avery Everett, who was aboard the Huey as a crew chief, his family said. He had served two tours in Iraq and was about to deploy for a tour in Afghanistan. Mr Everett, who leaves behind a wife, Holly, a five-year-old daughter and a two-year-old son, left a job as a youth pastor at a church in Fresno, California to join the Marines after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. He was a wrestler in high school, played the saxophone as a kid and participated in marching band in junior high school, according to his mother. He also traveled to Mexico for several weeks to serve as a missionary for his church. 'I saw him Sunday night, we came by to visit and he had walked me to my car and hugged me and kissed and told me, ""Mama bear, I love you,"" and I told him, ""Baby bear, I love you too,""' she said as she gathered with family to begin making funeral arrangements. Mr Everett's brothers are also helicopter pilots. Tragedy: This image shows an aerial view of the site where two Marine helicopters collided . Also among the dead was Major Thomas Budrejko, a Connecticut native and Cobra pilot who had served three tours in Iraq and was due to start a second tour in Afghanistan soon. 'He died doing what he loved to do,' Mr Budrejko's father told the Norwich Bulletin. 'He loved flying and he loved the Marine Corps.' Officials said it could take weeks to determine what caused two helicopters, an AH-1W Cobra and a UH-1 Huey, to crash in midair during a routine exercise on Wednesday night, killing all aboard the aircraft. Skies were clear and the weather was mild. The accident occurred near the Chocolate Mountains along the California-Arizona border - a sprawling desert range favoured by the U.S. military because its craggy mountains and hot, dusty conditions are similar to Afghanistan's harsh environment. Chaplains and counselors were called in to talk to troops. Six of the Marines killed were from Pendleton, California and one was from Marine Corps Air Station Yuma in Arizona. Crash: A Cobra helicopter like this one was involved in the crash which killed seven Marines on Wednesday . Disaster: The other helicopter involved in the deadly accident was a Huey similar to the one pictured . All the Marines were part of the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. With 17,500 Marines and sailors stationed at Camp Pendleton and Yuma, the unit conducts hundreds of aviation training exercises a year so troops can get as much experience as possible before they go to war. Two of the Marines who died were aboard the AH-1W Cobra and the rest were in the UH-1 Huey utility helicopter. They were flying in a remote section of the 1.2-million-acre Yuma Training Range Complex as part of a two-week standard training called 'Scorpion Fire' that involved a squadron of about 450 troops from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing. It was the fifth aviation accident since March involving the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing headquartered, at Miramar Marine Corps Air Station in San Diego. Throughout the Navy and Marine Corps, there have only been two other aviation training accidents in the past five years involving seven or more deaths, according to the military's Naval Safety Center.","Corey Little, 25, was expecting his first child in September .

"Argentina did cheat its way to victory at the 1978 World Cup after its government arranged with Peru to rig a key match, it was claimed today. Host nation Argentina needed to win its second round game by four clear goals to reach the final at the expense of arch rivals Brazil. There have always been suspicions about the game after Argentina secured a comfortable 6-0 win, before going on to beat the Netherlands 3-1 in the final to win their first World Cup. Champions: Argentina captain Daniel Passarella holds the Jules Rimet trophy after his team won the 1978 World Cup final 3-1 against the Netherlands . Match winner: Striker Mario Kempes scored twice in the final against the Netherlands, but should Argentina have even got through? Group B with one game to play .

After the first round of games, Brazil beat Peru 3-0 while Argentina saw off Poland 2-0. The two South American giants then played out a tense 0-0 draw, leaving them both level going into the final game. Brazil then beat Poland 3-1, but because Argentina were not playing until later that day they knew they had to beat Peru by four clear goals to qualify for the final. Trailing 2-0 at half time, Peru collapsed in the second half and Argentina went on to win 6-0 and made it to the final in the Estadio Monumental, Buenos Aires. During the final, star striker Mario Kempes gave Argentina the lead, only for Dirk Nanninga to equalise for the Netherlands. With seconds left, Rob Rensenbrink hit the post and the game went into extra-time, before Kempes hit his sixth of the competition to win the World Cup for Argentina for the first time. But now former Peruvian Senator . Genaro Ledesma has confirmed that the shock result was agreed before the . match by the dictatorships of the two countries. Mr . Ledesma, 80, made the accusations to Buenos Aires judge Noberto . Oyarbide, who last week issued an order of arrest against former . Peruvian military president Francisco Bermudez. He . is accused of illegally sending 13 Peruvian citizens to Argentina as . part of the so-called Condor Plan, through which Latin American . dictatorships in the 1970s cooperated in the repression of political . dissidents. Once inside Argentina, the prisoners were tortured by the brutal military regime and forced to sign false confessions. Mr . Ledesma, an opposition leader at the time, claims Argentininan dictator . Jorge Videla only accepted the political prisoners on condition that . Peru deliberately lost the World Cup match - and by enough goals to . ensure Argentina progressed to the final. He said in court: 'Videla needed to win the World Cup to cleanse Argentina's bad image around the world. 'So he only accepted the group if Peru allowed the Argentine national team to triumph.' Group B in the second round of the tournament was made up of Argentina, Brazil, Poland and Peru. After Brazil beat Peru 3-0, then saw off Poland 3-1, Argentina knew it had to win its game against Peru by at least four goals. They did so with a suspicious degree of ease, leading to rumours that Peru might have been bribed. Other rumours claimed Peru had been offered a large shipment of grain to throw the match. Argentina caused controversy by delaying their games until the outcome of the other result in Group B, so they knew exactly what they needed to do before every match. Rapturous welcome: Argentina fans give their team a ticker-tape reception as they run out in the World Cup final in the Estadio Monumental, Buenos Aires . Without their 1978 World Cup victory, Argentina would have won the tournament just once - the same as England, France and Spain. Years after the game, Argentine striker Leopoldo Luque said: 'With what I know now, I can't say I'm proud of my victory. 'But I didn't realise; most of us didn't. We just played football.'","Mario Kempes and Co won 6-0 to make it through to final .

"It captured the imagination of a generation of children. And for decades, there were fears it might have been lost forever after falling into unscrupulous hands. Now those who searched for the elusive golden hare from the 1970s Masquerade mystery will finally be able to see it up close – when it goes on public display for the very first time. The amulet, created by artist Kit Williams, is to be shown at the Victoria and Albert museum as part of a new design exhibition. Mystery: Those who searched for the elusive golden hare from the 1970s Masquerade mystery will finally be able to see it up close - when it goes on public display for the very first time . Popular: Williams's children's story Masquerade was a publishing sensation, selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979 . He sparked a nationwide treasure hunt when he buried the jewel three decades ago – with clues as to its whereabouts published in a children’s storybook. But to the disappointment of hundreds of thousands of enthusiasts, the amulet was eventually unearthed by a fraudster who cheated his way into the discovery. Even more alarmingly, it was then sold off to a mystery buyer in the Far East – and lost for 20 years. But in an extraordinary twist of fate, the current owner came forward in 2009 after learning of its significance to the UK and has now put it on temporary loan to the museum. In a rare interview, its publicity-shy creator said he was glad his fans would finally have the chance to see it. Williams said: ‘The idea was to bury . something in the cold wet earth. It was the romance of it, that whatever . people were doing, that jewel was waiting for them. ‘It . hasn’t been seen by the British public before, as it was taken out of . the ground by a rather dubious man who didn’t want to show it. ‘The . amulet looks the same as when I made it, although some of the green . stones have turned black after being preserved in wax while underground. ‘The current owner is very nice, I have met her and I’m glad she’s got it. She didn’t realise it had this other life. ‘She’s delighted that it’s going on display in Britain.’ On display: The amulet, created by artist Kit Williams, is to be shown at the Victoria and Albert museum as part of a new design exhibition. In a rare interview, he said he was glad his fans would finally have the chance to see it . Reunited: Kit Williams and Bamber Gasgoine, riight, with the Golden Hare that they buried together in 1979 . Finders keepers: Poster promoting the finding the hare in the 1970s -  the hare was the prize for winning the puzzle from the book Masquerade by Kit Williams . Williams’s children’s story Masquerade was a publishing sensation, selling almost a million copies when it appeared in 1979. Among the illustrations and story, he inserted clues to locate a golden hare amulet – which he buried in a field himself. But though two physics teachers cracked the puzzle in 1982, they were beaten to the treasure by another searcher. This man, who has never been identified, appeared to have found the hiding place through his connection with Williams’ girlfriend. She had known of the rough position in Ampthill Park, Bedfordshire, and the exact spot was narrowed down using metal detectors. The hare was eventually auctioned in December 1988, and sold for £31,900 to an unknown buyer. Williams had hoped to buy it back but dropped out of the bidding at £6,000. Sotheby’s contacted Williams to verify the authenticity since the stones appeared to be a different colour -  but the auctioneer was unable to tell him who the eventual buyer was. The current owner came forward by chance in 2009 after her grandaughter happened to be in London and hear about it on the radio. The woman, who lives in the far east, prefers to be anonymous because she holds an ‘important position’ in her country – but was moved to hear of the story of Masquerade and wanted to get involved. Williams added: ‘It’s become a family heirloom. A member of her family wears it to Christmas dinner every year. ‘I . don’t know what will happen to it, but my hopes are irrelevant. It’s . like a child, it’s grown up and its got its own life now. ‘I’m . glad that I created Masquerade, but I wouldn’t do it again. I wasn’t . prepared for how big it would get. I had people knocking on my door in . the middle of the night asking for clues.’ The . jewel is to form part of an exhibition of the best British designs of . the 20th and 21st centuries at the Victoria and Albert Museum starting . on Saturday March 31. Ghislaine . Wood, who curated the exhibition, said: ‘Visitors who owned the book, . or who remember the excitement it generated at the time, will be . thrilled to see the hare. ‘This . is the first time it has been on public display since it was found, and . hopefully it will evoke strong memories for many. A new generation of . visitors may also be inspired to go back and discover the book for . themselves.’ Williams, now 65, lives in Gloucestershire with his wife, Eleyne, and paints for a living.","The amulet, created by artist Kit Williams, is to be shown at the Victoria and Albert museum as part of a new design exhibition ."
"Mariano Rivera drifted back to the outfield wall, just like he'd done in batting practice so many times before, baseball's greatest closer tracking down another fly ball with childlike joy. Everything changed before anybody could blink. The Yankees' 12-time All-Star caught his cleat where the grass meets the warning track in Kansas City, his right knee buckling before he hit the wall. Rivera landed on the dirt, his face contorted in pain, as Alex Rodriguez uttered the words 'Oh, my God' from some 400 feet away. Scroll down for video .

Writing: Rivera, left, screams in pain after tearing his ACL and meniscus while another player calls for help . Down for the count: He holds his right knee in pain . Bullpen coach Mike Harkey was the first to reach Rivera, whistling toward the Yankees' dugout for help. Manager Joe Girardi had been watching from behind the batter's box and set off at a run down the third-base line, angling toward centre field and his fallen reliever. 'My thought was he has a torn ligament, by the way he went down,' Girardi said later. His instincts proved correct. Rivera was diagnosed with a torn ACL and meniscus Thursday night after an MRI exam taken during the Yankees' 4-3 loss to the Royals. The injury likely ends his season, and quite possibly his career, an unfathomable way for one of the most decorated pitchers in history to go out. 'It's not a good situation, but again, we've been through this before, and we're being tested one more time,' Rivera said, pausing to compose himself in the Yankees' clubhouse.

The 42-year-old Rivera has said that he'll decide after the season whether hang it up after 18 years in the major leagues. 'At this point, I don't know. Going to have to face this first. It all depends on how . the rehab is going to happen, and from there, we'll see.' -Mariano Rivera on whether the injury will end his career . And while Girardi said he hopes that baseball's career saves leader makes a comeback, Rivera sounded as if retirement is a very real possibility. 'At this point, I don't know,' he said in a whisper. 'Going to have to face this first. It all depends on how the rehab is going to happen, and from there, we'll see.' The injury seemed to cast a pall over the Yankees, who played from behind the entire way Thursday night. They put the tying run on third base in the ninth inning before Mike Moustakas made a stellar play on a chopper by Rodriguez, throwing him out by a step to preserve the win. Afterward, the only thing on A-Rod's mind was Rivera. 'I saw it all go down,' Rodriguez said. 'It's hard even to talk about it tonight. I mean, Mo has meant so much to us on a personal level, and his significance on the field, on the mound. But the bottom line is we're the New York Yankees, and nobody is going to feel sorry for us.' Sitting tight: Rivera was taken on the field in a tractor and was later taken off for evaluation . Casting doubt: Speaking to reporters later, Rivera said he doesn't know whether the injury will allow him to return to baseball . There's a much different feeling about Rivera, though. One of the most durable pitchers to ever play the game is well-liked and universally respected. That's what happens when you save 608 games and have five World Series rings. 'You're talking about somebody who does something that's never been done,' said Derek Jeter, who had four hits in the game. 'It's not like somebody comes along the next day and does it.' Jeter said that Rivera has been shagging balls for '20-some years,' at least as long as they've known each other. It never crossed the captain's mind that Rivera would get hurt tracking down a fly ball in batting practice. It's just something that people had come to accept. 'That's his conditioning. He's always shagging balls,' Jeter said. 'He's like a centre fielder anyway. It was a freak thing. There's no other way you can explain it.' Girardi also defended Rivera's decision to shag balls in batting practice, pointing out that the reliever hadn't been on the disabled list since 2003, and reasoning that Rivera may never have become the same shutdown closer if not for all the work he put in before games. Eagle eyes: Pictured April 9, Rivera sits in the dugout before a baseball game against the Baltimore Orioles in Baltimore. Rivera was examined by Royals associate physician Dr. Joe Noland and Yankees trainers, and was set for an MRI at KU MedWest . The closer: Rivera, seen again on the April 9 game against the Baltimore Orioles, is a 12-time All-Star for the Yankees . 'You have freak injuries, and this is one of them,' Girardi said. 'We had a guy carrying a box down the stairs that broke his foot. You can fall off a curb. You have to allow him to be an athlete and a baseball player and have fun out there. I've never seen Mo do anything recklessly, or seen Mo dive to try to rob a home run. It's the way he exercises.' Girardi was too far away from the outfield wall to see what happened, but he knew that Rivera had sustained a significant injury when he saw players and coaches gathering around him. Rivera grabbed immediately at his right knee and started rubbing it, stopping only to briefly cover his face with his glove. Harkey and Girardi eventually carried Rivera to a cart brought onto the field, gently setting him into the back with his knee propped up. 'At first I thought he was being funny, but then I realized that he was injured, he was down, and that's when I really got worried,' said David Phelps, who made his first major league start Thursday night. 'There's nothing I can do but stand there and watch. It's a miserable feeling.' The cart rounded the warning track before disappearing up a tunnel, and Rivera didn't put any weight on his knee when he was helped back into the Yankees' clubhouse.

He was examined by Royals associate physician Dr. Joe Noland, but it wasn't until the MRI exam was taken at KU MedWest that head physician Dr. Vincent Key made the diagnosis. 'I thought it wasn't that bad, but it's torn,' Rivera said. 'Have to fix it.' Girardi said that Rivera would be reexamined by the Yankees' physicians, but Rivera said that he would rather remain with the team in Kansas City than fly back to New York on Friday. The Yankees play three more against the Royals before a day off. 'If it's going to happen, it's going to happen doing something I love to do. And shagging I love to do,' Rivera said. 'I'd do the same thing, without hesitation. The reasons why it happen, you have to take it as it is. Fight through it. You know, just have to fight.' Rivera is only the latest closer to go down with a significant injury this season. The Royals' Joakim Soria, the Reds' Ryan Madson and the Giants' Brian Wilson all required Tommy John surgery. Golden arm: Rivera is seen pitching against the Texas Rangers in the ninth inning of the April 23 game in Arlington, Texas . Tampa Bay's Kyle Farnsworth is out with a strained elbow, Boston's Andrew Bailey had surgery to repair a ligament in his right thumb, and Washington's Drew Storen had a bone chip removed from his elbow, though the Nationals expect him to pitch this season. Of course, none of those players has nearly the pedigree of Rivera. With the same devastating cutter that has carried him for years, Rivera has made at least 60 appearances each of the last nine seasons. He blew a save on opening day this year, but allowed only two hits in eight scoreless innings after that, picking up five of his 608 saves. 'I always argued he was the best pitcher of all-time,' first baseman Mark Teixeira said. 'Not just the best reliever, but the best pitcher of all-time. 'Accidents happen. That's all I can say. You can get hurt getting out of bed, literally. You can get hurt doing anything,' Teixeira said. 'That's MO. Part of what makes him great is he's so athletic, and he loves to run around out there and have fun. You can't play this game for 15-plus years without having fun. It was just a tough accident.'","Yankees pitcher Mariano Rivera tore ACL and meniscus during practice before game in Kansas City .

"One of Mitt Romney's high school classmates says that the presumptive Republican presidential nominee was 'evil' in his younger years, and acted like he was a schoolboy gone mad 'like Lord Of The Flies'. The Romney camp was reeling after the revelations that he forcibly shaved the head of a high school classmate who was regularly taunted for being gay. The former governor of Massachusetts grabbed tearful John Lauber and hacked away with a pair of scissors because he thought his bleached blond hair was ‘wrong’. Mr Romney also supposedly mocked another student who was a closeted gay by shouting ‘Atta girl!’ when he tried to speak in class. Now, in damage control mode, Mr Romney's campaign staff have contacted a number of the candidate's former classmates to try to get them to speak out publicly on his behalf. Family politics: Mitt Romney (left) is pictured with his father George and mother Lenore in 1962, one year before Ann Keenan's death . That plight isn't going so well, as a number of those contacted have been thinking the choice over. Stu White, a friend of Mr Romney's who . attended Cranbrook School with the candidate, said that he is 'still . debating' if he will help the campaign after he received a call from Mr . Romney's older brother Scott. 'It's been a long time since we've been pals,' Mr White told ABC News. Though they may not have spoken for . some time, Mr White's name does come up on the Romney campaign trail as . he was the one who threw the party where Mr Romney met his wife Ann. Mr White, who says he is not the only . classmate to have been contacted by the campaign, was quoted in the . explosive Washington Post article as saying that he has 'long been . bothered' by the hair-cutting incident. Phillip Maxwell, an old friend of Mr Romney's, called the incident 'bullying supreme'. 'I grew up with him.  We were best friends in elementary school.  We always remained friends.  Mitt is wonderful, very bright, an enormously energetic human being…   a friend all my life, but this was a side of him that I hadn’t seen,' Mr Maxwell said. Torment: The Republican presidential hopeful was said to have taunted students who were known to be gay and those from poor backgrounds at the exclusive Cranbrook School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan . ABC News cites an unidentified . classmate as saying that 'a lot of guys' who attended Cranbrook School . have 'really negative memories' of Mr Romney's behavior. Apparently those classmates are hesitant to come forward because of Mr Romney's denials when the incidents have been discussed. The incident supposedly happened in the . summer term in 1965 when Mr Lauber, who was a year below Mr Romney, came . back from Spring Break with his hair dyed blond and styled so it was . draped over one eye. According to the Washington Post, . Mr Romney would not let it go and told his friend Matthew Friedemann: . ‘He can’t look like that. That’s wrong. Just look at him!’ A . few days later Mr Romney assembled a posse which found Mr Lauber, . tackled him to the floor and held him down whilst the future governor of . Massachusetts snipped away. When it was completed, the crowd cheered Romney as he walked out of the room. The . incident was recalled by five former Cranbrook pupils including Thomas . Buford, a retired prosecutor, who helped hold Mr Lauber down. He said: ‘It happened very quickly, and to this day it troubles me. What a senseless, stupid, idiotic thing to do.’ Phillip Maxwell, who is now a lawyer, added: ‘It was a hack job. It was vicious.’ Mr Friedemann, a dentist, also felt bad for not stopping it happening and admitted Mr Lauber was ‘easy pickins’. 'It makes these fellows (who have told . the stories) very remorseful. For (Mr Romney) not to remember it? It . doesn't ring true. How could the fellow with the scissors forget it?' the man told ABC. Mr Romney was quick to arrange a radio . interview on Wednesday so that he could make an apology, though that . does not seem sufficient to trump the symbolism of the story coming out . the day after President Barack Obama publicly announced his support of . same sex marriage. 'I participated in a lot of hijinks . and pranks during high school and some may have gone too far. And for . that I apologize,' Mr Romney said. He continued to try to distance the . incident from the debate over same-sex marriage by denying that the . perceived homosexuality of the victims had nothing to do with the . pranks. '(Homosexuality) was the furthest . thing from our minds back in the 1960s, so that was not the case,' he . said, adding that the students involved 'didn't come out of the closet . until years later.' He said: ‘Back in high school, you . know, I did some dumb things. If anyone was hurt by that or offended by . that, obviously I apologize. ‘But overall, high school years were a long time ago'. Interviews . with Mr Romney’s former classmates at the $54,000 a year Cranbrook . School in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, reveal he was fond of jokes that . were mostly good-natured by sometimes had a hard edge. After . the shaving incident Mr Lauber ‘seemed to disappear’ from life in . school and was later expelled for smoking and died in 2004 of liver . cancer. Decades after it happened he ran into . one of Romney’s friends who helped hold him down and told him: ‘It was . horrible. It’s something I have thought about a lot since then.’ Opposition: Mitt Romney was forced to defend himself saying he was not homophobic the day after President Obama said he supported gay marriage . Family man: From right, Michigan Governor George Romney, his wife Lenore, daughter Lynn and son Mitt in New York, 1964 . Friends recalled how he and his friends would be up all night larking around, the sound of his laughter filling the corridors at 2am. In English class however things took a more sinister twist - Mr Romney had a habit of interrupting fellow pupil Gary Hummel, a closeted gay at the time, by shouting: ‘Atta girl!’ According to the Washington Post he also behaved in a ‘sour’ fashion towards scholarship student Lou Vierling when he found he he was from a poor area of Detroit. Mr Romney’s wife Ann has claimed that contrary to his public image as a ‘tin man’, as one friend has claimed, he is actually a ‘wild and crazy man’. It was a hack job. It was vicious. Phillip Maxwell, former classmate of Mitt Romney . And details about his pranks have . come to light before, notably in the biography, ‘The Real Romney’,  by . Boston Globe investigative reporters Michael Kranish and Scott Helman . The problem with the latest revelations however is that they suggest a cruelty which voters might find hard to stomach. Romney’s . most famous such incident is also his most controversial - when he . strapped his dog to the top of his car whilst on a 12-hour drive from . Massachusetts to Canada in 1983. Seamus the Irish Setter was put in a crate on top of the vehicle because there wasn’t room inside. Among . the claims in ‘The Real Romney’, is that Mr Romney once shouted: ‘Oh . yeah!’ and gave an impromptu rendition of the Michael Jackson hit . ‘Billie Jean’ at a meeting with other Mormons - whilst doing the . Moonwalk. While at Stanford University he . dressed up as an anti-Vietnam protester to infiltrate what he thought . was a plot to embarrass the college. At . Cranbrook he also once staged an ‘elaborate formal dinner’ in a busy . corridor and another time impersonated a cop to scare two girls who were . being driven around by two friends.

Acceptance: The church at the exclusive Cranbrook school which Mitt Romney attended in his teens . When Mr Romney flagged them down he discovered some beer in the trunk as they had agreed would happen - but left the women terrified they were about to get into trouble. Mr Romney’s spokeswoman Andrea Saul said: ‘Anyone who knows Mitt Romney knows that he doesn’t have a mean-spirited bone in his body.’ Obama's dramatic change of heart on the issue of gay marriage yesterday sent shockwaves through the political world. But while gay rights advocates applauded Obama's announcement on Wednesday, Republicans accused the commander-in-chief of pulling off a cynical political manoeuvre. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus accused Obama of placating voters. Priebus said in a statement: 'While President Obama has played politics on this issue, the Republican Party and our presumptive nominee Mitt Romney have been clear.' Obama's announcement also opened up the first major battleground in this year's election campaign. Romney himself did not swipe at Obama directly, but affirmed his own views on same-sex unions during an Oklahoma campaign stop, saying: 'I believe that marriage is between a man and a woman.'","Republican presidential candidate shouted 'Atta girl' at male student who was a closeted gay .

"When it comes to cross-Channel relations, it is perhaps fair to say that the French are as fond of us as we are of them. But in case there was any lingering doubt that relations just might thaw ahead of the Olympics, you should take a look at these images first. They are part of a Eurostar poster advertising campaign to encourage the French to take the high-speed train to London 2012. Sacre bleu! This cheeky Eurostar poster features a spoof Greek statue of naked men pursuing popular pub sports . The posters, which were created by a . French ad agency, invert the usually athletic form of ancient Greek . statues to portray Les Rosbifs as pot-bellied, beer-swilling slobs with a . penchant for pub games. Two portly actors were recruited to . model for the job, in which the ‘sculptures’ were created in digital 3D . and based on photographs. Far from displaying a chiselled physique, the figures appear to carry more than a little weight around the belly. Instead of holding the discus or . crouching in athletic pose, one clutches a snooker cue while the other . holds a dart. Last night, Leg, the agency behind the ads, insisted they . were in good fun and a ‘homage to English popular culture’. The posters are aimed at attracting the French to take the high speed train to London 2012 - possibly to poke fun at our Olympic aspirations . The ads were designed by Paris ad agency Leg with whom part British-owned games sponsor Eurostar has been working for more than a decade . Its previous creations for the campaign included a redesign of a British banknote showing Mr Bean in a tiara. Former West End star Howard Crossley was one of the actors used in the latest campaign. Unmasked as the pot-bellied snooker . player, the 59-year-old ex-Royal Shakespeare Company actor said: ‘I’m . not in the best of shape these days but that’s obviously what they were . looking for. I am what they think is a typical middle-aged Englishman . whose idea of sport is drinking beer and playing snooker. ‘I knew roughly what the idea was and that it was the French’s idea of a joke.’ Leg president Gabriel Gaultier . insisted the Eurostar adverts have been universally well received. He . added: ‘The public awaits the next ads religiously, wondering “what will . they think up next?”’ Perhaps unsurprisingly, the advertisements do not appear in England. Eurostar said the campaign was ‘a tongue-in cheek campaign playing on the age-old Franco-British rivalry’.",Spoof Greek statues show naked men with beer guts clutching darts and snooker cue .
"A psychotic mother smothered her baby after her marriage hit a crisis and she began using cannabis heavily. Carly Jacques developed post-natal depression three months after giving birth, when her husband confessed he had made one of her best friends pregnant during an 18-month affair. Jacques started taking cannabis – at one point using £60 worth of the drug every day or two – and developed mental problems. 'Illness rather than wickedness': Carly Jacques (left) smothered her seven-month-old baby, Skye, after suffering delusions. She was found by her husband Mark (right) clutching their daughter on the sofa of their Leicester home . By the time she smothered daughter . Skye, when the infant was seven months old, she was suffering from . delusions and had become convinced neighbours were out to harm her and . the child. Yesterday the 32-year-old  customer . services manager was made the subject of a hospital order after a judge . ruled she needed to be given treatment rather than punishment. Jacques had previously admitted the . rarely-used charge of infanticide – defined as the killing of a child . under the age of 12 months by their mother, but who at the time of the . act was of disturbed mind, having not fully recovered from the effect of . giving birth. Following the case, her mother, Julie . Tame, said: ‘Carly was a fantastic mum. Her husband cheated on her with . one of her best friends and that triggered her mental decline. He . destroyed her world.’ The couple had been married five years but had been together since Jacques was 18. Leicester Crown Court heard that . following her husband Mark’s confession in March last year, Jacques . began showing symptoms of post-natal depression and turned to cannabis. Downward spiral: Mrs Jacques developed depression after learning of her husband's affair with another woman and then triggered delusions by smoking large amounts of cannabis . She started to suffer delusions, suggesting there was a body in her attic and she was being filmed in her home. Her GP prescribed Prozac and referred her to a counsellor. The court heard that the night before Skye died in October, Jacques had been smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol at a party. When her husband woke up  at their . home in Leicester the following morning, he went downstairs to discover . Jacques clutching the ‘obviously blue’ body of their daughter. She was holding a blade in her hand . and said: ‘What have I done?’ She then slashed her own wrists as her . husband – who was not in court – struggled to disarm her. Jacques then slashed her neck with a carving knife before she was again disarmed and taken to hospital. Skye suffered no visible injuries and the cause of death was given  as smothering. Jacques needed 40 stitches for her . injuries. Police arrested her in hospital on suspicion of murder and she . admitted what she had done. She told police: ‘I just thought we could . go to sleep and we would both be safe.’ The court heard Jacques had tried to commit suicide the week before she smothered her child. Mary Prior, defending, said Jacques was ‘a good mother’ but it was clear . that what caused the tragedy ‘was the admission from her husband of an . affair’. Sentencing her, Judge Michael Pert QC . said: ‘I am satisfied that what led you to that terrible act was . illness rather than wickedness.’ Jacques was made the subject of a Section 37 Hospital Order. She was also handed a Section 41 Restriction Order. This means doctors must first seek permission from the Ministry of Justice before Jacques can be discharged from hospital care.","Carly Jacques, 32, driven to drugs after 'husband's affair with her friend'

"A Chinese football fan died after going 11 nights without sleep as he tried to watch every single kick of the ball of Euro 2012. Jiang Xiaoshan, said to be supporting England and France in the tournament, died of exhaustion on Tuesday morning. Because of the time difference, he reportedly stayed up each night with friends and then went to work the following day. Tragic: A Chinese football fan died after the Ireland v Italy match after going 11 nights without sleep as he tried to watch every single kick of the ball of Euro 2012 . Fanatical: Jiang Xiaoshan was said to be supporting England (left) and France (right) in the tournament . Following the Ireland versus Italy match, Sina.com said he went back to his Changsha home at 5am on Tuesday, had a shower, fell asleep and never woke up. Friends said the news of his death came as a shock, as he lived a 'relatively healthy life', and had played football for his university team just a couple of years before. Sources said, however, that the effect of alcohol and tobacco, combined with the chronic exhaustion, was to blame for his death as it weakened his immune system. It is not the first time a Chinese football fan has suffered from trying to keep up with their on-pitch heroes. Exhaustion: There has been a worrying increase in people suffering from sleep deprivation in recent years from watching too much TV or being online . During the Germany 2006 and South Africa 2010 World Cups reports surfaced of people being admitted to hospital after their bodies broke down from not sleeping. Sleep deprivation from playing online video games is a huge problem in South Korea. Jiang Xiaoshan watched: . * 21 matches of live Euro 2012 action . * That equates to 1,890 minutes of football . * Saw a total of 51 goals . Earlier this year video game addicts in the country were told they could have the amount of time they spend playing limited to just four hours per day. The country's government said it was looking at introducing a 'Cooling Off' system to regulate the time students play in a 24-hour period. It wants to stamp out online bullying, and stem a number of suicides attributed to internet and video game addiction. Their game will switch off after two hours, where they will be given a 10 minute rest, and can then only log again in once for a maximum two hours in the following 24 hours. Scene: The man died in his sleep after going back to his Changsha (pictured) house . It follows the Shutdown Law, passed in November, which bans gamers under the age of 16 from playing between midnight and 6am. Fears are growing in South Korea that rampant gaming will lead to more deaths if the system is not introduced. In February, in Taiwan, a young gamer lay dead in an internet cafe for nine hours before anyone noticed. Chen Rong-yu, 23, was thought to have suffered a heart attack after playing League of Legends for 23 hours straight. He was apparently still sat on the chair with his hands stretched out in front of the keyboard as if he was still playing in the cafe in New Taipei City.","Time difference means matches are played in the middle of the night .

"Security firm G4S repeatedly assured ministers that they would 'overshoot' their targets for recruiting Olympics security staff, the Home Secretary said today. Theresa May said the under-fire firm continually assured ministers that they would be able to recruit enough private security guards for the Games. But she added they had not 'deliberately deceived' the Government, telling MPs that the firm made clear that the problem with 'workforce supply and scheduling' only emerged 'over the last couple of weeks'. G4S only admitted they would fall short last week, when an extra 3,500 troops were called in. Officers from nine forces will now join them to fill the shortfall. Assurances: Theresa May tells MPs  that G4S repeatedly told ministers that they would 'overshoot' their recruitment targets . Attack: Mrs May was forced to answer an urgent question submitted by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper . Labour’s former defence secretary Bob Ainsworth said the decision to send in the troops was taken 'ludicrously last minute' and Tory MP Julian Lewis said G4S should have recruited more veterans to police the Olympics in the first place. The Home Secretary was being grilled in the Commons after Speaker John Bercow approved the request for an urgent question by shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper, following claims that the Home Office was warned about security problems at the Olympics ten months ago. Mrs May told MPs: 'G4S repeatedly assured us that they would overshoot their target. 'G4S only told the Government that they would be unable to meet their contractual arrangements last Wednesday and we took immediate action.' G4S, which has seen its shares dive by as much as 10 per cent following the Games security debacle, said venue security was being tightened 'before the full complement of accredited staff have been assigned'. 'This situation is being rectified over the coming days, which should lead to the withdrawal of police officers from those roles assigned to private security,' a G4S spokesman said. Today's Commons question came after a . report by Her Majesty’s Inspectorate of Constabulary highlighted a . number of issues that needed to be addressed. But . it was only last week that the Home Secretary told Parliament that . 3,500 extra troops were being drafted in because private security firm . G4S could not deliver the promised number of guards. As . the row escalated, Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt defended G4S and the . company’s boss said he may have to quit over the fiasco. Debacle: The Home Secretary, pictured meeting police chiefs at the National Olympic Co-ordination Centre in London in July last year, told the Commons that the shortfall in G4S guards only became clear on Wednesday . Call up: Extra police have been drafted in to fill the gaps in Olympics security caused by blundering private firm G4S . Mr Hunt insisted it was ‘completely . normal’ for contractors to fail to meet their commitments on major . projects such as the Olympics. He insisted the firm had been ‘quite honourable’ and dismissed the problem as a ‘hitch’ which has now been dealt with. There are now claims that a further 2,400 troops - the equivalent of three battalions - will have to be drafted in to secure the Games which open in just under a fortnight. It emerged today that the extra police will also have to be called on. Assistant Commissioner Chris Allison, . the National Olympic Security Co-ordinator, said: 'Nine venue forces . have now deployed police officers to support security regimes at venues . in their areas.' The forces involved are Dorset, . Surrey, Hertfordshire, Northumbria, South Wales, Strathclyde, West . Midlands, Thames Valley and Greater Manchester. Mr Allison went on: 'Whilst some of . the activity police officers are undertaking was not anticipated, plans . were put in place to allow us to do this. 'Forces are making sure they make the . best use of their resources locally to do all they can to minimise the . impact on local policing.' Debacle: The officers will join an additional 3,500 troops who have been drafted in to help protect the Olympic park . Shambolic: G4S Nick Buckles (above) was also under intense pressure to explain why he only learned 'eight or nine days ago' that his company was struggling to find the 10,000 staff it was contracted to provide for the Olympic Games . But West Midlands Police Federation chairman Ian Edwards said it was 'chaos, absolute chaos'. The force has had to provide 150 officers per day to cover a hotel in Warwickshire where footballers are staying, he said. 'The worst-case scenario is that we . end up having to find another 200 officers for the security at the City . of Coventry stadium, and we've yet to find out what the shortfall is in . Birmingham. It's chaos, absolute chaos. 'You shouldn't lose your local police . officer because of the Olympics. Communities are suffering because a . private company has failed to deliver on a contract.' Mr Hunt refused to rule out the . prospect and told BBC1’s Andrew Marr Show: ‘G4S have been quite . honourable. They have put their hands up. ‘The chief executive has said they got . it wrong, they have apologised, they are going to cover all the costs, . he has apologised to the troops who are going to be drafted in at the . last moment. ‘I think it is completely normal that . you are going to find some contractors on a project of this size who . aren’t able to deliver what they promised.’ Mr Hunt denied that ministers had . failed to supervise the contract properly, insisting they had received . repeated assurances from G4S that it was on course to meet its . commitment to provide 10,000 guards for the Games. London 2012 chairman Lord Coe also said security would not be compromised by G4S. He told the BBC: ‘This actually wasn’t about supply, they [G4S] have been interviewing about 100,000 people. ‘The reality is, and I cannot put this . any more simply, when they expected people to materialise they simply . didn’t. That is why we moved quickly to stem that gap.’ Prelude to the grand event: A troupe of 'extreme dancers' hang from the Millennium Bridge in London during the London 2012 Olympic Festival today . Newfangled dangle: The performance, choreographed by New Yorker Elizabeth Streb, is taking taking place on several of London's landmarks . Prime Minister David Cameron said the Government had been monitoring potential Olympic problems since it took power. Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg . added: 'It is being sorted out, it will be sorted out and we will . deliver a secure Olympic Games.' Olympics minister Hugh Robertson . said: 'In terms of the security numbers, I am as confident as I can be . at this stage that the problems identified last week and the plans . brought forward very quickly to deal with it will result in the delivery . of secure and safe Games.' A confidential report by HM . Inspectorate of Constabulary (HMIC) warned about concerns over security . 10 months ago, leading Games organisers Locog to increase the number of . security guards to be supplied by G4S from 2,000 to 10,400 while the . value of the contract more than trebled from £86 million to £284 . million. Defence Secretary Philip Hammond . appeared to reject calls for soldiers to receive a £500 bonus for . helping during the Games, in line with those to London bus and tube . staff. Political storm: Home Affairs Committee chairman Keith Vaz (left) will be questioning Mr Buckles on Tuesday about the debacle, a crisis Culture Secretary Jeremy Hunt (right) has dismissed as nothing more than a 'hitch' He said: ‘The Armed Forces is a . contingent organisation. People who join it expect to be asked at short . notice to do tasks that they have not necessarily envisaged doing.’ Mr Hammond was confronted with the . comments of an anonymous commanding officer on Radio 4’s The World This . Weekend who said he was angry that he had to tell his men they would be . deployed at the Games, just months after having to tell them that many . of them could be made redundant. The officer said: ‘They will be in . camps without proper washing facilities. Will we ever see a real . strategy for the Armed Forces, rather than cost-cutting dressed up as . strategy? ‘Our people deserve more than hollow platitudes. Mr Hammond will also be responding to . scheduled MPs' questions this afternoon, when he is expected to deal . with some of the implications for the troops involved - such as the . potential for awarding them a special medal and ensuring they do not . lose out on leave.

"High-ranking Chinese politicians have been accused of taking part in an orgy after more than 100 pictures showing three naked men and two nude women were uploaded to a social media website. The photos, which appeared on China's Twitter equivalent Weibo, reportedly show the group engaging in sexual acts in a hotel room. It is claimed the men are the Party secretary of Lujiang county in Anhui Province, Wang Minsheng, his deputy, Jiang Dabin, and the party's youth leader at Hefei University, Wang Yu. Gone viral: One of the pictures uploaded to micro-blogging site Weibo which reportedly shows three high-ranking Chinese politicians posing with two women during an alleged orgy . Threesomes are technically illegal in China and suspects can be prosecuted under a 'group licentiousness' statute added to the criminal code in 1997, according to reports. Minsheng has denied any part in the scandal, which has spread like wildfire across the country, and believes the allegations have been made against him because he is currently handling a corruption case. He claims the images have been doctored by his political enemies. Yu, however, has admitted being in the pictures and said one of the women was his school teacher wife. Denials: At least one of the officials allegedly involved has denied that it is him in the photos - claiming instead that opponents have somehow doctored the images . The Global Times, which is affiliated . with the Communist Party, cited a police officer with the Lujiang . county public security bureau as confirming the case was under . investigation, but did not confirm if a suspect had been arrested, . according to The Huffington Post. The . images, which went viral on Weibo last week, have sparked so much . attention on the micro-blogging site that the State Council Information . Office, China's top web censor, has stepped in. It . has issued an official directive stating that 'all websites must stop . following and hyping the so-called ""Lujiang Indecent Photos Incident.""' The scandal comes as Gu Kailai (left), the wife of disgraced Communist official Bo Xilai, stands trial accused of murdering British businessman Neil Heywood (right) Phrases such as 'naked photos' and 'vulgar photos' have been banned from the site, according to www.gawker.com.

The body of missing schoolgirl Tia Sharp was so badly . decomposed police identified her from her dental records.

"A family were shocked when they returned home from a holiday to Spain and found a deadly scorpion hiding in their suitcase. Hollie Jayes, 18, found the Deathstalker scorpion - the second most venomous species in the world - crawling inside her mother’s luggage at their home  in Skegness, Lincolnshire. Theresa Jayes, 43, had emptied the suitcase of her clothes and left it in her bedroom without noticing the 10cm-long (four-inch) creepy crawly inside. Venomous: The poisonous Deathstalker scorpion found in a suitcase after a family holiday to a Spanish village . It was only when her travel agent daughter went to borrow her mother's suitcase for a trip to see a friend on Saturday that the creature was discovered. The yellow scorpion - which is more commonly found in Egypt - had crept inside the luggage while Mrs Jayes was on holiday in the tiny village of Santa Peta in Andalucia with her 12-year-old son David last month. Her daughter said: 'I was getting ready to go out with a friend and I needed to pack some stuff to stay at hers. 'I walked over and opened the case and just saw this thing on the top of everything in there. Roommate from hell: Holly Jayes and her mother Theresa were horrified when they found the 10cm creature, which had been hiding in their luggage for a month . 'I thought it was a spider so I screamed and slammed the case shut. 'After I calmed down, me and my friend picked up a coat hanger and opened the case and we realised it was a scorpion. 'We both screamed and slammed the case shut and threw it into the bathroom, there was a lot of shouting and shaking. 'I called my dad and shouted down the phone that he needed to come home because there was a scorpion in the case. Creepy-crawly case: The Deathstalker is the second deadliest scorpion in the world and there is no anti-venom for its sting in the UK . The yellow scorpion, or Deathstalker, is highly dangerous and capable of inflicting extraordinarily painful stings. It normally would not kill an otherwise healthy adult human, but young children, the elderly and people with conditions such as heart problems or allergies are at much greater risk. A sting can cause anaphylaxis, a potentially life-threatening reaction, and the venom is very resistant to drugs. The anti-venom is mainly available in Arabic countries where the scorpion is usually found. The Deathstalker is usually 3-4 inches long and could be mistaken for a toy because of its spindly legs and rubbery looking yellow or green exterior. It can be a very aggressive type of scorpion and tends to get very nervous and agitated in captivity. 'He didn’t believe me at all but I insisted. 'When him and my mum came home, we straightened out the coat hanger and nudged open the case and they saw it and jumped as well. 'My dad threw the case into the garden and for some reason my mum decided the best thing to do was call London Zoo. 'They said they couldn’t do anything, so eventually we called the RSPCA and they came and picked it up. They told us eventually it was called a Deathstalker. 'I was terrified when I opened the case, I’ve never seen a scorpion before. 'The RSPCA gave us the case back and told us to make sure it hadn’t laid any eggs in it.' Mrs Jayes, who sells window blinds, added: 'My husband was at the fish counter in Morrisons buying some mussels and he got a phone call from two girls screaming about a scorpion. 'He said to me ""we can’t go home, there’s a scorpion in the house"" and laughed because we thought it must be an earwig or something. 'When we got home we found my son David stood on the landing with an empty wine bottle ready to bop it on the head if needs be. 'When we saw it we were quite naive because we thought it must be some common thing, not dangerous, but it turns out it’s the second most deadly in the world and there’s no anti-venom in this country. 'It’s quite scary to think back - I put my hand in that case 20 or 30 times while unpacking, I must have been so close to it.'","Species of scorpion is second most venomous in the world .

Opening his tribute to the dead consulate staff members, Mr Obama spoke of Christopher Stevens and said he, 'was everything America could want in an ambassador.' 'Four Americans, four patriots. They loved this country. They chose . to serve it, and served it well,' said Obama. He also spoke movingly about Department of State employee Sean Smith and the two former Navy SEALS Glen A. Doherty and Tyrone S. Woods who also perished in the attack. 'They had a mission they . believed in. They knew the danger, and they accepted it. 'They didn't . simply embrace the American ideal, they lived it; they embodied it.

'Today we bring home four Americans who gave their lives for our country and our values,' said Clinton.  'To the families of our fallen colleagues, I offer our most heartfelt condolences and deepest gratitude.' The transfer of remains came three days after an attack on the . consulate, one of a series of assaults on U.S. outposts in Muslim . countries that U.S. officials blame on an anti-Muslim video made in the . United States. Clinton said the rage and violence aimed at . American missions was prompted by 'an awful Internet video that we had . nothing to do with.' Clinton praised Sean Smith and ex Navy SEAL Tyrone Woods as someone who she knew personally. 'He had the hands . of a healer as well as the arms of a warrior, earning distinction as a . registered nurse and certified paramedic,' said Clinton of Woods. Clinton also . hailed the other ex-Navy SEAL, Glen Doherty. 'He, too, died as he lived, . serving his country and protecting his colleagues.' The Secretary of . State said Stevens, 'won friends for the United States in far-flung . places,' and thanked his parents, who were at the ceremony, for the . 'gift' that Stevens was.

"Ever since he won the lottery three years ago, Lucien Nault's life has been plagued by calamities, from legal battles to the breakup of his marriage. And now the 77-year-old retired taxi driver from Montreal has suffered a double blow when his son and daughter-in-law passed away just weeks apart. Mr Nault hit the jackpot in March 2009, vowing to ‘spoil his family’ with the $16.9million prize from the 6-49 lottery, but instead of happiness and stability, the money has brought nothing but misery to the elderly man’s life, tearing his family apart. Winner: Lucien Nault, pictured with his ex-wife, won the lottery in 2009 . On Tuesday, the Edmonton Sun . reported that the lottery winner's son, Daniel, was struck and killed . in a car crash as he ran out of his yard in a Montreal suburb to catch . his runaway dog. The . tragedy comes less than three weeks after Daniel's wife was found dead . in the pool the two had built at their home in the Gaspe region. The . untimely deaths of the couple were just the latest in a series of . misfortunes Lucien Nault has faced since the day he held the oversized . check in his hands. Daniel was furious with his father for giving away $5million of the prize money to his neighbors. Crash: Mr Nault's son Daniel was killed after being struck by a Jeep . Tragedy: His death comes less than three weeks after his wife drowned . This . spring, he sued four neighbors and a relative of his father's . ex-wife, claiming that they took advantage of the elderly man whose mind . has been fading lately, and who is 'a total invalid,' according to . court filings. The . lawsuit alleges that one neighbor manipulated the elder Mr Nault into . buying her a $300,000 house and a Mini Cooper valued at $35,000, among . other costly gifts. Daniel also sued Roger Thibodeau, brother-in-law of his father's wife who had left him just months after the lucky win. Unlucky strike: Lucien Nault won $16.9million in the 6-49 Lottery in 2009, and since then his life has been plagued by calamities . Meanwhile, the son and his wife, Therese Rehel, who had received a large portion of the jackpot, continued to enjoy their new-found wealth, building a luxurious pool complete with floodlights and stonework at their home in Lavaltrie, Quebec. The couple celebrated the completion of the months-long construction project with friends, and days later, on September 2, Therese Rehel Nault was found dead under water in the pool of her dreams. On Tuesday, the lottery curse claimed another victim in the Nault family when Daniel was killed after bolting into the path of an oncoming Jeep.","Lucien Nault, 77, won $16.9million in 6-49 lottery in 2009 .

"President Barack Obama has a final chance in Florida tonight night to halt Mitt Romney’s late surge and stave off a re-election defeat after plummeting in the polls after his disastrous first debate performance. Obama leads by a wafer-thin 0.2 per cent nationally in the RealClearPolitics poll of averages. But he is down seven in the Gallup . tracking poll, down two in the Rasmussen poll and has seen his leads in . Florida and Virginia disappear and his Ohio advantage whittled down to . almost nothing. The big stage: Lynn University students serve as stand-ins during final preparations for the debate . Practice run: Stand-ins for US President Obama, right, and Romney, left, and moderator Bob Scheiffer, center, participate in a rehearsal a day ahead of the final presidential debate at Lynn University . The latest NBC/WSJ poll, which had Obama three points ahead before the debates, now puts the two candidates dead level on 47 points each among likely voters with six per cent undecided. Although most pundits and post-debate polls have Obama the advantage over Romney following the second debate, he has seen no improvement in the polls and the momentum appears to remain with the Republican nominee. The final presidential debate will focus on foreign policy - a traditional Republican strength that should be an advantage for Obama this time around because of the demise of Osama bin laden last May and the end of the Iraq war. Indeed, Obama has served notice that he will play the bin Laden card to full advantage, saying in his speech at the Al Smith dinner in New York last week: 'Spoiler alert: We got bin Laden.' Stunt double: Lynn University student Eric Gooden, a stand-in for President Obama, walks off stage during final preparations for Monday's presidential debate . At the vice-presidential debate in Kentucky, it took Vice President Joe Biden one minute and seven seconds into the first answer of the debate - to a question about Libya - to bring up bin Laden. Libya, however, presents Obama with some problems. Although Romney got tangled up in the weeds of whether Obama had referred to the Benghazi attack as a 'terrorist act,' during their last bout, the death of the first U.S. ambassador to be murdered in the line of duty since 1979 and the intelligence and security failures that led to it make the president very vulnerable. In addition, it has become clear that . the White House’s initial insistence that the attack was a result of . protests about an anti-Islam video made in California were flat wrong - . and possibly part of an official cover-up.

Before the two candidates first . debated on October 3rd, Obama held a 15-point lead over Romney on the . question of who was more capable of dealing with foreign affairs. After Obama’s lackluster performance, a Pew Research Center poll found that the gap had closed to just four points.

Democrats shot back, arguing that Romney and his party are the ones playing politics with national security.

Early and absentee voting are already . under way in many of the most competitive states, upping the pressure . on both candidates to lock in supporters.

"Last year she was hailed as one of the most influential people in the world - a defender of women's rights as Afghanistan's only female head prosecutor. Ms Bashir has been lauded by both . Michelle Obama and Hilary Clinton - and she was one of ten women to receive a 'Women of Courage' Award in Washington last year. But Maria Bashir's reputation is now in doubt after the Times revealed that Ms Bashir is also the most prolific prosecutor of women for Afghanistan's so-called 'moral' crimes, such as adultery. While Ms Bashir campaigns against abuse husbands, more than half of the 172 women jailed in Afghanistan for sex outside of marriage (known as 'zina') have come from her province. Defender or jailer? Maria Bashir, pictured with with First Lady Michelle Obama U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, has jailed more than 100 women for adultery in Afghanistan . The Herat province's population stands at an estimated 1.7million, and Afghanistan as a whole has a population of 35million. Last week Ms Bashir, who became lead prosecutor in 2006, and has prosecuted nearly a thord of the 78 women jailed for murder in Afghanistan, was promoted to become Herat's attorney-general. The Times said diplomats are 'shocked' by the extraordinary tally of women imprisoned for adultery. It further says that 101 out of 136 women serving in Herat's women jail are there for adultery, one of the moral crimes which campaigners for women's rights are trying to remove from Afghanistan. Two sides: Maria Bashir, attorney general of Herat comforting Arefa, a victim of domestic violence, in Herat, Afghanistan, last year . When she received her award, the two presidential wives said: 'Ms Bashir has waged a determined campaign against crime and corruption. 'She stands out as a champion of judicial transparency and women's rights, and exemplifies the resilience of Afghan women.' When the Times contacted Ms Bashir, she said she was unaware that her prosecution rate was so much higer than other provinces, but blamed it on her province's closeness to the border with Iran. She said: 'If it is higher it's because we are bordered with Iran, which culturally influences Afghans.'",More than 50% of women jailed for adultery in Afghanistan come from province prosecuted by Ms Bashir - which holds just 20% of the population .
"Donald Trump said that he has 'gigantic' news about the President which he will announce on Twitter Wednesday . Donald Trump announced today that he has a 'gigantic' bombshell about President Obama that he will reveal on Wednesday. The billionaire real estate baron told Fox & Friends this morning that he had 'something very, very big concerning the president of the United States'. 'It's going to be very big. I know one thing- you will cover it in a very big fashion,' he added. Trump wasn't giving away any clues, however, but only went on to say that it could 'possibly' play a role in the election. He said h is waiting to Tweet the 'large, bordering on gigantic' news 'sometime probably Wednesday'. Trump has been one of the most outspoken critics of the President and has also threatened to run against him. He has also toured New Hampshire and said very clearly that he was seriously contemplating a presidential run.

Barbed: President Obama dedicated a portion of his White House Correspondents Dinner speech in 2011 to making fun of Trump and his birther theories . Picking sides: Trump has continued the birther conspiracy theories, even though Romney's camp has avoided many mentions of the contentious issue . He believes that his Hawaiian birth certificate is fake or non-existent. In April 2011, Trump announced that he paid to have a team of investigators to Hawaii to truly delve into the issue. In response, President Obama released the long form edition of his birth certificate after spending years refusing to do so. 'Normally, I would not comment on something like this...I've got other things to do,' Obama said at the time.

Competition: A site called October Surprise claims to have revealing documents about one of the candidates . This is the second time in as . many months that Trump has said that he has a big surprise that would be . damaging to the President, though the last time he said so - in the . days leading up to the Republican National Convention - nothing came of . it. Trump's announcement . comes the same day as another surprise: a mysterious website called 'The . October Surprise' says that it will release documents at 5.30pm on . Monday. Very little is known about the . creators of the site, the type of documents that they are referring to, . or even their intended target. The . Twitter bio for the site simply reads: 'One of your presidential . candidates isn't being honest with you. Stay tuned to find out which one . it is.' Star: Trump, seen here with Bret Michaels who stars on All Star Celebrity Apprentice, has been a critic of Obama and his presidency for years . Political power: In February, Trump held a press conference endorsing Mitt Romney's presidential bid . The big reveal will take place just . hours before the third and final debate which is dedicated to foreign . policy. As a result, spectators believe that the documents- which . allegedly are muzzed and used as the picture on The October surprise . sites- relate to a foreign issue. Fox & Friends host Steve Doocy: We have sources, Donald, that you have a large, bordering on gigantic announcement this week? Trump: I do. Doocy: What is it? Trump: I's going to be announced probably on Wednesday but I have something very very big concerning the president of the United states. Doocy: Give us a hint! Trump: I won't do that. Doocy: Just a little hint! Trump: I won't do that, but I will talk to you probably on Wednesday. That's probably when I'm going to announce... It's going to be very big, I know one thing: you will cover it in a very big fashion . Fox & Friends host Gretchen Carlson: Will it change the election? Trump: Possibly. Fox & Friends host Brian Kilmeade: Is it personal or does it have to do with how he governs? Trump: All in one, everything. It's very big. Bigger than anyone would know. 'We can't predict media/campaign reaction, but the content is irrefutable,' the creators wrote to one Twitter inquiry. Sensing . a playful competition between the two reveals, The October Surprise . tweeted at Trump, saying that they beat him by making a big . announcement. There is no telling if the two announcements are related . in any way. While The October Surprise is keeping both candidates in the dark, Trump was not as impartial. The . billionaire businessman-turned-reality star and Obama have a barbed . relationship on both sides. Trump repeatedly called Obama 'the worst . president ever', and Obama referred to Trump as a 'carnival barker' once . he released the long form birth certificate. The President also spent a portion of his speech at the White House Correspondent's Dinner in April 2011 taking jabs at Trump. 'Now, I know that he’s taken some flak lately, but no one is happier, no one is prouder to put this birth certificate matter to rest than the Donald,' Obama said in the speech. 'And that’s because he can finally get back to focusing on the issues that matter –- like, did we fake the moon landing? What really happened in Roswell? And where are Biggie and Tupac?' Over the past year, Trump's birther . rhetoric has died down significantly and he has focused his attention to . the Republican primary race, eventually supporting Romney's bid.

"Doomed: Roberto Curti was high on drugs when he was chased by police in Sydney. He died after being held down and tasered 14 times. His chase and arrest were captured on CCTV (pictured) Australian police who used taser guns . repeatedly on a Brazilian student behaved with an ‘ungoverned pack . mentality’ - like schoolboys from the novel Lord of the Flies - a coroner said . today. Roberto Curti, 21, died after he was . pinned down by police, handcuffed and hit with 14 taser shots after a late night . chase through the streets of Sydney earlier this year. In a series of scathing findings following the two week inquest in Sydney, New South Wales coroner Mary Jerram recommended that five officers involved in the struggle be considered for disciplinary charges, but stopped short of calling for a criminal investigation into their actions. No definite cause of Mr Curti’s death was found during the inquest, but the coroner was told he might have choked while he was being restrained face-down on the footpath after he had had capsicum spray used on him and had been hit by tasers. The coroner said that one probationary constable, Daniel Barling, who had used his taser right up against Mr Curti’s shirtless body in what is known as ‘drive-stun mode’ five times, had shown ‘appalling’ judgement and had behaved in a thuggish manner. Miss Jerram said some officers had shown an ‘ungoverned pack mentality’ and acted ‘recklessly and dangerously’. Some police, she said, ‘threw themselves’ into the confrontation ‘like schoolboys in Lord of the Flies’ and recommended their actions be referred to the Police Integrity Commission. Lord of the Flies is the title of a classic novel by English author William Golding which tells how a group of British boys form a tribe and try to govern themselves, with savage results, after they become trapped on an island following a plane crash. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: The cause of Mr Curti's death is not certain, but he may have choked while being held down on his front by the police . Crime: Mr Curti was caught on camera in a shop where he stole two packets of biscuits. The shop's owner did not think the incident worth reporting, but a woman outside raised the alarm . Chase: The Brazilian student, who had taken LSD that night, is chased through the streets by officers in Sydney . ‘Roberto’s only foes . during his ordeal were the police,’ said the coroner, who had heard that . the student had taken the hallucinogen drug LSD earlier, had stolen two . packets of biscuits from a shop and was in a psychotic state when the . police chase began. ‘There was no victim other than Roberto, no member of the public who suffered an iota from his delusionary fear,' she said. ‘Certainly he had taken an illicit drug, as has become all too common in today’s society, but he was guilty of no serious offence, he was proferring no threat to anyone, there was no attempt by police [to] consider his mental state.’ The inquest heard that the manager of the shop from which the biscuits were taken considered the theft so harmless he did not call police – but a cleaner outside thought she had witnessed an armed robbery and raised the alarm. Physical: Officers wrestle with Mr Curti in the middle of the road as they try to restrain him . Pinned down: The student is shown with a hand on his throat as the police pin him to the ground. It is believed he may have choked when he was rolled onto his front . Shock: He appears to have a taser gun held against his body as the police continue to try to restrain him . Miss Jerram said that none of the . taser stuns after Mr Curti was brought to the ground were justified and . that the police had been ‘reckless, careless, dangerous and excessively . forceful.’ Aside . from singling out probationary constable Barling for criticism, Miss . Jerram also faulted the behaviour of the most senior officer at the . scene of the struggle, Inspector Greg Cooper. His evidence, she said, had been ‘so self-contradictory, self-serving and obscure’ it wasn’t worth repeating. 'Both his actions during the event . and his attempts to exonerate himself and blame more junior officers . afterwards are little more than contemptible,’ said the coroner. CCTV: Student pinned to ground and tasered. GRAPHIC CONTENT . Evidence: The area where Mr Curti was held down is cordoned off as officers collect evidence . Criticised: The coroner criticised the police officers involved for behaving with a 'pack mentality' and recommended that five be considered for disciplinary action . Handing down an open verdict on the cause of Mr Curti’s death, Miss Jerram recommended an ‘immediate review’ of standard operating procedures for tasers and capsicum spray. She also asked the police commissioner to consider whether probationary constables should be allowed to continue using tasers. After the findings were delivered, Mr Curti’s brother-in-law, Michael Reynolds, said his family was still in shock. Referring to the young man they knew as their ‘beloved Beto’, Mr Reynolds called for criminal charges to be laid against police directly involved in the struggle. ‘Nothing will ever bring Beto back, but we continue to push for those responsible to face the consequences of their appalling behaviour on that night,’ said Mr Reynolds.","Roberto Curti, 21, died after being pinned down and tasered by police following chase through streets of Sydney .

"A man who grew up in foster care because of an abusive father was shocked when he discovered that his long-lost mother is the world record holder for the woman with the longest beard. Richard Lorenco, 35, of Kansas was abandoned by his father in a motel room aged 4-years-old. Over the next seven years he was moved around seven foster homes and he says he coped by pretending his mom was a famous rock star. In a recent episode of Shocking Family Secrets, Lorenco describes his ‘complete shock’ when he found out that his mom, 64-year-old Vivian Wheeler, was in fact a famous circus performer, who held a Guinness world record for her 11-inch beard. Reunited: After more than 30 years apart Richard Lorenco and his mom, bearded lady Vivian Wheeler, are close once again . Lorenco says that despite the unusual nature of her profession, he thought it was ‘really cool’ when he found out his mom had spent her life as a famous side show performer, using the stage name Melinda Maxie. When Lorenc finally made contact with . his mother after more than 30 years he was surprised to find out about . her unusual life, but heartened to finally meet her. ‘I . had a loving mother the whole time,’ he explained on a recent episode . of Shocking Family Secrets, which airs on the Discovery Fit and Health . Channel. His mother told him how they had escaped from her abusive husband, but he had tracked them down and snatched her child. As a result of his difficult childhood, Lorenco had chosen to spent most of his adult life focused on the future and building a new life with his wife and two young daughters. But when a back injury led to questions about his family medical history, Lorenco decided the time was right to find out about his biological parents. 64-year-old grandmother Vivian Wheeler maintains a Guinness world record breaking 11-inch beard . Lorenco says he was initially surprised to find out his mom was a bearded lady, but also says it was 'kinda cool' Six weeks after filing his request with the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, Lorenc received a letter saying his biological mother was a Wheeler of Bakersfield, California . The letter also informed him that both his mother and his maternal grandmother had been born with a condition known as hypertrichosis or werewolf syndrome, which meant that even as children they had facial hair. The letter also stated that his mother had born a hermaphrodite, with both male and female reproductive organs, although as a baby the male genitalia had been removed because the parents wanted a girl. If Robert Lorenc had a traumatic childhood, it pales in comparison to his mom. Wheeler’s father had told her to go and work in the field of performing at the age of five years - with a salary of $1,000 per month he sent to the house - because he was ashamed of her. Vivian Wheeler, pictured in 1992, has spent most of her life working in circuses and sideshows as a bearded lady . Between tours, she would return home and reach for a razor. 'My dad said to shave because people wouldn't understand why I had facial hair, saying, ""This is what you'll have to do to fit into society,'"" Wheeler told AOL News in 2010. As she grew older, she would shave sometimes to placate the men she dated, 'because of their low self-esteem. It didn't bother me.' Wheeler stopped shaving her beard entirely in 1990 shortly after the death of her mother. 'I let it grow back to be myself,' she said. 'Without my beard, I'm not me. I'm pretending to be someone I'm not.' It is now two years since Lorenc and Wheeler were reunited and they have gone on to build a kind and loving relationship. Their story is told in the recent issue of Shocking Family Secrets entitled ‘Debutante in Distress’.

"First Piers Morgan became the subject of a petition calling for him to be deported from the US for upsetting the gun lobby there. Now a counter-petition has been started, asking for America to keep him – not because he’s popular there but (allegedly) because no one here wants him back. The broadcaster is at the centre of a row after criticising pro-gun campaigners on his nightly US chat show in the wake of the Sandy Hook elementary school massacre, in which 20 children and six adults were shot dead. More than 72,000 Americans have so far signed a petition on the White House website calling for him to be kicked out. Response: The White House defended the freedom of speech and the press on Wednesday in a long-awaited response to an online petition to deport CNN host Piers Morgan over his views on gun control . But a second petition on the same website now insists he must stay in the US, not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also – ‘more important’ – because ‘no one in the UK wants him back’. So far, just over 400 people have signed the ‘Keep Piers Morgan in the USA’ petition so it has some way to go before it reaches the 25,000 signatures which guarantees a response from the US government. It was proposed by Janusz Jasinski, a Birmingham-based website designer. To add to the former newspaper editor’s embarrassment, a third petition is calling on Home Secretary Theresa May to stop him from returning to Britain. Appearing on the US website Change.org it has so far attracted more than 100 signatures and states: ‘We got rid of him once and why should we have to suffer again. The Americans wanted him so they should put up with him.’ This petition was written by ‘Hackergate’, alias delivery driver Steven Nott, who gave evidence to the Leveson Inquiry about how he tried to raise the alarm in 1999 about how mobile phones could be easily hacked. Last week Morgan repeatedly attacked pro-gun guests on his CNN show. More than 71,000 Americans have already signed an initial petition calling for the British journalists deportation after he criticised pro-gun campaigners on his chat show . Now a second petition on the White House website now insists he must stay in the US, not only because he has a constitutional right to free speech but also 'more important' because 'no one in the UK wants him back' In a heated exchange with Larry . Pratt, of Gun Owners for America, Morgan called him an ‘idiot’, . ‘dangerous’ and an ‘unbelievably stupid man’ after he argued that more . guns would actually cut crime. In another debate on gun controls, . Morgan shouted down economist John Lott, author of More Guns, Less Crime . and branded him a liar for claiming gun crime trends in countries such . as Britain supported his thesis. With CNN reportedly about to overhaul . its prime time line-up and possibly move Morgan to a later slot, the . combative presenter has not commented on the row since Christmas Day, . when he tweeted: ‘Merry Christmas! Even to those who want me deported.’ He has stood by what he said, . insisting that banning assault weapons and high-capacity gun magazines . is no attack on the US Constitution but simple common sense.

"A group of Siberian percussionists have become an internet hit with an exhibition of ice drumming on frozen Lake Baikal. In minus 20C, they found by pure chance that the one metre thick ice has a distinctive and haunting rhythm all of its own, reported the Siberian Times. 'I felt like we were playing on the drums that Nature has left out for us, alone under the sun on the frozen waters of the world's most magnificent lake,' said Irkutsk architect Natalya Vlasevskaya, 31, a mother-of-one and organiser of Etnobit percussion group.

Rhythm: A group of Siberian percussionists have become an internet hit with an exhibition of ice drumming on frozen Lake Baikal . Beats: The group use the frozen waves of the lake to make an unusual, evocative melody . The 25 million year old lake, which freezes in winter, is the deepest and oldest in the world. The group use the frozen waves of the lake to make an unusual, evocative melody - but they realised the musical potential of Baikal only after the wife of one of their drummer's fell over walking on the ice. 'She made a very musical 'boooooom' sound -  so nice and deep that her husband, who has a very good ear,  said 'Hold on, what was it? How did you make that noise?'' said Natalya. The group went back to the exact spot to record their remarkable percussion recital. Happy discovery: The group only realised the musical potential of Baikal only after the wife of one of their drummer's fell over walking on the ice . Playing with history: The 25 million year old lake, which freezes in winter, is the deepest and oldest in the world . 'I will always remember the first feeling,' said Natalya. 'You see your hand touching the ice, you hear the sound, but your mind just can't take it in. 'You cannot believe that, yes, this beautiful clear sound is indeed produced by ice. ' She said some people accused them of faking the remarkable ice music, but it was genuine. 'Some people with several musical educations came to say that we were just fooling people, and it was all made up, which is not true,' she said. Ice fun: One of the musicians balances a block of ice on his head . Cold tunes: They performed close to the popular tourist island of Olkhon. The sound is not the same at other places on the ice-bound lake . 'Still,  I understand precisely why not everyone could believe it was for real. 'When I first realised Baikal's musical potential I, too, well remember the feeling on overwhelming excitement and joy - but also disbelief.' Their performance was made in March on the frozen waters close to the popular tourist island of Olkhon. Evidently, the sound is not the same at other places on the ice-bound lake. 'People later asked us how we found the spot where different bits of ice sounded so much in harmony with each other,' she said. 'The answer is, I don't know. This is  just how was. 'This is perhaps what I mean by saying about it being the wonder of Nature, that all we had to do was to discover that place, get there, and start playing. 'Everything else was ready, arranged for the most perfect harmonious sound.'","In minus 20C, they play one metre thick ice which has a distinctive sound .

"Nearly 4,000 foreign murderers, rapists and other criminals are roaming the streets, free to commit new crimes. The Government wants to deport them but admits that many cannot be kicked out because of their human rights. A Parliamentary answer reveals that 3,980 foreign criminals who should have been sent back to their country of origin are ‘living in the community’. Home Secretary Theresa May, left, faces calls for Britain to leave the European Convention on Human Rights which foreign criminals such as rapist William Danga, right, have used to help them stay in the country . The figures do not even include the handful of terrorist suspects such as Abu Qatada whom the Government is seeking to extradite. Officials say thousands use the Human Rights Act, which guarantees the ‘right to family life’, or fears about violence in the countries they left as a way of dodging deportation. Around 800 of the foreign criminals have been at large in Britain for more than five years. The revelations last night prompted calls for the Government to withdraw from the European Convention on Human Rights so that the foreign offenders can be sent home. Ministers admitted last year that  a string of murders and sex attacks have been committed by foreign nationals who should already have been kicked out. Foreign criminals on immigration bail have committed three murders, three kidnappings and 14 sexual offences, including rape. Official figures show that there have also been arrests in relation to 27 other ‘violent crimes’ and 64 thefts. Home Office Minister Mark Harper used a Parliamentary written answer to release the most recent figures, recorded at the end of September. He said: ‘There are 3,980 foreign nationals in the UK subject to deportation action living in the community. We continue to pursue removal in all these cases. ‘The principal barriers to removal are non-compliance on the part of individuals which means we have insufficient evidence of nationality and identity to obtain a travel document, ongoing legal challenges and the situations in countries of return.’ Home Secretary Theresa May has issued new guidance to judges saying Section 8 of the Human Rights Act, which guarantees the right to family life, should not override serious criminality in deportation cases. But critics say that is not enough to solve the problem. Tory MP Priti Patel, who asked the Parliamentary question that led to the publication of the figures, called for the abolition of the Human Rights Act. She said: ‘Lax immigration and border controls inherited from the previous Labour government have left this mess and the current Government must take all steps necessary, including abolishing the Human Rights Act, to get these people removed from Britain. ‘The public deserve to have a robust immigration system in place to keep them safe instead of laws and rules designed to help foreigners remain in Britain when they should have no right to be here. ‘Hard-pressed taxpayers will be disgusted to learn that they are footing the legal fees and living costs associated with this number of foreigners overstaying their welcome.’ Sir Andrew Green, chairman of MigrationWatch UK, said: ‘This is an extraordinary number. Offenders and their lawyers are clearly playing the legal system. ‘The case for pulling out of the 60-year-old ECHR gets stronger by the day. The Government is trying to give better . guidance to the courts but that is most unlikely to have the necessary . impact. 'The only long-term solution is to pull out of the ECHR . completely and write our own human rights law.’ The figures don't even include terror suspects such as Abu Qatada whom the Government is seeking to extradite . The figures were published after Tory MP Priti Patel, left, asked a Parliamentary question  which was answered by Home Office Minister Mark Harper, right . David Cameron has set up a review into whether a British Bill of Rights could replace the Human Rights Act, but his Lib Dem partners will oppose any move to leave the ECHR. Ministers say they are speeding up the deportation process. The average number of days between a foreign national offender finishing his or her sentence and being removed has fallen from 131 days in 2008 to 74 in 2011. A UK Border Agency spokesman said: ‘We are absolutely determined that any foreign national who fails to abide by our laws should face the consequences and in 2011 we deported more than 4,600 foreign criminals.' An earlier version of this report of Government figures carried the headline ‘4,000 foreign murderers and rapists we can’t throw out … and yes, you can blame human rights again’. We appreciate that unless the headline was read together with the first paragraph of the article, the impression may have been given that all those people were murderers and rapists. We are happy to clarify that the ‘4,000’ refers to the 3,980 foreign criminals currently subject to deportation orders,  a total which includes murderers and rapists, some of whom committed offences while on immigration bail.","Government wants to deport them but admits many cannot be kicked out .

"The head of the European Commission provoked scorn last night by claiming the euro was out of the danger zone. Despite the economic slump across the region, Jose Manuel Barroso said the single currency was no longer at risk of collapse. ‘I think we can say that the existential threat against the euro has essentially been overcome,’ he told a conference in his native Portugal. ‘In 2013, the question won’t be if the euro will or will not implode.’ Things are looking up: Jose Manuel Barroso at the Portuguese diplomatic meeting where he announced that the threat against the survival of the eurozone was over . However, Neil Mellor, a currency expert at Bank of New York Mellon, said Mr Barroso was ‘simply not in a position to make such predictions’. He added: ‘2013 will be a tougher year than 2012 for Germany and by extension, the euro area as a whole. The crisis is most certainly not over.’ David Buik, an analyst at City spread-betting firm Cantor Index, said: ‘With the level of austerity that must be implemented, there can be no growth in Mediterranean countries or, for that matter, France for years to come. ‘The day of reckoning will come and many of these economies will be staring in to the economic and financial abyss. The crisis is far from over.’ And Louise Cooper, a leading financial analyst, said: ‘Of course Mr Barroso is going to talk up the survival of the euro as he is the EC president. ‘In every financial crises going back to the beginning of time, politicians lie to us. They almost have to. Civil unrest: An Italian protester holds a stone during clashes with riot police at a students' demonstration against austerity measures in downtown Rome last November . ‘It is their job to pretend that the situation is better than it is in order that they do not make the situation worse by talking it down. ‘But that does not mean that we need to believe what they say.’ The eurozone has enjoyed a period of relative calm since Mario Draghi, the head of the European Central Bank, pledged to do whatever it took to save the currency – and in particular stand behind the debts of cash-strapped governments such as Spain. It has boosted confidence in the euro and few analysts are now predicting a break-up of the single currency this year. Rise of extremism: Members of the Greek extreme-right ultra nationalist party Golden Dawn (Chryssi Avghi) light flares in a street protest in Thessaloniki last summer . But it is feared the region is in for further hardship as unemployment soars and recessions deepen – stoking public anger amid mounting opposition to the flawed currency union. The crisis will play a central role in crucial elections in Germany and Italy – the biggest and third biggest economies in the eurozone. In her New Year message, German chancellor Angela Merkel last week warned that 2013 will be a tough year for Germany and the eurozone. Even though the consensus has swung towards the euro staying intact, economists still fret about the wider long-term effects of austerity. A possible explanation for Europe's relative social peace to date is that the burden of adjustment has fallen mainly on the young. In Spain, for example, the number of under-25s in work fell from 39.1 per cent in 2007 to 18.3 per cent in 2012, a fall of 20.8 percentage points.  For the 35-49 age group, who are better protected against layoffs, the drop over was 8.9 percentage points. This mix of 'youth sacrifice' and relative economic security for the bulk of the population might be why street protests have failed - except in Greece - to translate into a big shift in votes for radical parties, according to Gilles Moec, a Deutsche economist. But the potential economic cost is huge. With fewer youngsters working, Italy and Spain have suffered a loss in productivity of about 2 per cent, Mr Moec estimated. The textbook answer is to push policies to end the divide between hard-to-fire 'insiders' and typically young 'outsiders' on precarious short-term contracts. But the risk is that such structural reforms become discredited because voters associate them with declining living standards and rising inequality, said Simon Tilford, chief economist at the Centre for European Reform in London. 'The consequences are likely to be far-reaching. Not only will governments struggle to push through the needed reforms, but there is a risk of a broader backlash against the market economy and the European Union,' he said. ‘The crisis is far from over,’ she said. ‘The economic environment will not in fact be easier but rather more difficult next year.’ The latest forecasts from the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, a leading global financial watchdog, suggest the German economy will grow by a paltry 0.6 per cent this year. The French economy is set to grow by just 0.3 per cent, according to the OECD, while a further year of recession is expected in Italy and Spain. Unemployment is over 25 per cent in Spain and Greece and more than half of all youngsters there who want to work cannot find a job. French unemployment has soared to its highest level since the country adopted the euro – piling pressure on socialist president Francois Hollande. The Economist, the highly-respected financial magazine, recently warned that France is ‘the time-bomb at the heart of Europe’ – sparking fury in Paris. The eurozone crisis has been brewing since late 2009 before exploding to life in 2010. So far it has led to a change of government among eight of the 17 single currency zone member states. Asked about Mr Barroso’s latest comments yesterday, UKIP leader Nigel Farage said Mr Draghi’s pledge to prop up the euro ‘had temporarily diverted the markets’ attention’ but added that ‘fundamentally nothing has changed’. He said: ‘There are still massive economic flaws which will take more than words to cure.’ Erik Britton, a director at financial experts Fathom Consulting, said Mr Barroso was ‘not right and it’s not over’. He said: ‘It’s been pronounced over many times over the last few years, incorrectly, and this is just the latest such pronouncement. ‘It’s not dead, though it’s been lulled to sleep by the soothing melodies issuing from the ECB and elsewhere. ‘But there is always a risk it will wake up again – some shock like a bank failure, or another Greek default, or a surprise result in the Italian or German elections, or something like that.’","European Commission President spoke at diplomatic conference in Portugal .

"Medicine made more than 2,000 years ago has been discovered in an ancient Roman shipwreck. Archeologists investigating the wreck off the coast of Tuscany, Italy, say found a tin containing pills dating back to between 140 and 130 BC. They believe the medicine was an ancient eye treatment and say the discovery offers an insight into the use and sophistication of early medicine. Ancient: The medicinal tablets were found in the tin box that kept it safe from the sea water . Olive oil is one of the world's oldest medicinal agents. It has been used for centuries to treat dry skin but can also help combat dandruff, relieve sore throats, improve digestion and it also thought by some to prevent snoring. Pine resin can be used as an anti-inflammatory to help treat rheumatism. It also acts as a natural remedy for colds and coughs and can be applied on burns. Beeswax is also used to treat burns and as an anti-inflammatory. Chewing it is said to be good for teeth and gums. Analysis of the tablets, which are . thought to have been kept in a doctor’s chest, found they contain olive . oil, pine resin, which has antibacterial properties, beeswax and starch. They also contained an iron oxide and animal fats, as well as carrot, radish, parsley, celery and cabbage. Lead researcher Gianna Giachi, a chemist at the Archeological Heritage of Tuscany, told the BBC: ‘The research . highlights the care, even in ancient times, in the choice of the complex . mixture of products in order to get the desired therapeutic effect and . to help in the preparation and application of the same medicine.' She said the shape of the pills suggest they were used to treat the eyes. Alain Touwaide, scientific director of the Institute for the Preservation of Medical Traditions, in Washington DC, said they may also have been used to treat wounds. The wreck was discovered in the Gulf of Baratti, Italy, in 1974 . The boat, named the Relitto del Pozzino, was discovered off the Gulf of Baratti in1974 and is thought to have been a trading boat sailing from Greece. It is only now the tablets have been fully investigated. Scientists used a thin scalpel to peel away a small flake of the pill before studying it under microscopes and using DNA sequencing to analyse the organic elements. Dr Touwaide said the discovery provides evidence that some natural medicines have worked for thousands of years. He told everydayhealth.com: ‘This information potentially represents essentially several centuries of clinical trials. If natural medicine was used for centuries and centuries, it’s not because it doesn’t work.’","Analysis of the tablets found they contained vegetables, starch and beeswax .

"Unhappy: Stuart Lawrence, 35, is preparing to sue Scotland Yard for discrimination claiming he is pulled over without justification 'all the time' Scotland Yard yesterday referred shock police racism allegations by Stephen Lawrence’s brother to the force watchdog. Describing the claims by teacher Stuart Lawrence, 35, as a ‘very serious matter’, the Metropolitan Police passed his complaint on to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. In a strongly worded statement, the Met said it would not tolerate ‘any form of racism’ and promised strong action if any of its officers were found to have acted in a ‘racist manner’. Senior Labour MP Keith Vaz said he was ‘astonished’ to learn of Mr Lawrence’s apparent treatment by police. Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe ordered an investigation hours after Mr Lawrence claimed in yesterday’s Mail that he had been stopped by police up to 25 times simply because of the colour of his skin. Mr Lawrence alleges officers from Scotland Yard have repeatedly targeted him as part of a sustained campaign of harassment. The angry father of one, whose teenage brother was murdered in a racist attack in 1993, instructed lawyers to seek redress from the Met following his latest encounter with police in south London. He said he was moved to act after he was pulled over by two officers who saw him driving his VW Scirocco near his home in Peckham. Today we can reveal further details of the incident, which has sparked a new crisis in Britain’s biggest police force. Mr Lawrence said that as he approached his flat on the afternoon of November 16, he looked at the driver of a police vehicle as he passed it and continued to his flat. While driving down the road, he noticed that the police vehicle had turned around and it drove towards him at ‘great speed’, he said. The police vehicle pulled up and two officers got out to check his details. When he asked why he was stopped, one officer told him he was ‘naturally suspicious’ of him, he claimed. But later, he said, the other officer told him he had been stopped under Section 163 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, which gives police the power to pull over a vehicle. Mr Lawrence’s lawyers said that although the law gives officers authority to stop a car, ‘it does not cover the reason for the stop’. Brothers: Stuart Lawrence (right) pictured at home with his elder sibling Stephen (left), who was murdered . They claim the officers were trying, retrospectively, to ‘justify’ their decision to check his details. A letter of complaint was sent to Sir Bernard on Tuesday, naming the . officers allegedly involved in the latest incident and warning of future . legal proceedings. Mr Lawrence’s solicitor, Imran Khan, said his . complaint related specifically to when he was stopped at 5.20pm on . November 16. ‘That was the straw that broke the camel’s back,’ he said. ‘That was the . culmination of a course of conduct over many years which amounted to . harassment and discrimination based upon his skin colour, his ethnic . origin.’ He added: ‘We are delighted that they [Scotland Yard] are pursuing it so quickly.’ Family: Murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence's mother Doreen Lawrence OBE (left) and her son Stuart (right) pictured at a memorial held in his honour in April last year . Mr Vaz, chairman of the Commons Home Affairs Select Committee, said: ‘I . am astonished at the way in which Stuart Lawrence seems to have been . treated. No citizen of the UK should be expected to face what appears to . be a consistent campaign of stop and search.’ Scotland Yard said Mr Lawrence’s complaint would be ‘investigated thoroughly and speedily’. ‘Stop and search is an important tool to combat crime and is supported . by the community if it is used professionally and fairly,’ it said. ‘The . Commissioner has made it clear that he will not tolerate any form of . racism in the Met. ‘Strong action will be taken against any individuals in the Met if they are found to have acted in a racist manner.’ Tireless: The boys' mother Doreen Lawrence who has long campaigned  to rid the police of racism . Mr Lawrence’s brother was stabbed to death by a gang of five or six . attackers in Eltham, south-east London, in 1993, at the age of 18. The . original investigation into his death failed to solve the case and was . dogged by allegations of corruption and racism. The Macpherson Inquiry later concluded that the Met was ‘institutionally racist’. Only two of the killers have been convicted. Home Secretary Theresa May (left) has paid tribute to the campaigning work of Doreen Lawrence. Mr Lawrence sent a letter of complaint to Met Commissioner Bernard Hogan-Howe (right) outlining his concerns . Stuart Lawrence, who is engaged and has a two-year-old son, said he was . ‘angry and frustrated’ and felt there had been little progress in the . way police deal with black people. An IPCC spokesman said it was considering Mr Lawrence’s complaint ‘to determine the level of IPCC involvement’. The watchdog could decide to launch its own, independent investigation, . to supervise an investigation or to refer it back to the Met to carry . out an internal inquiry. Remembered: A police CCTV surveillance van at the site of the Stephen Lawrence memorial stone in Eltham, south-east London . By JAMES SLACK . Angry: Stuart Lawrence with his mother Doreen . Stop and search powers have been an issue of huge controversy since the Macpherson report branded the police ‘institutionally racist’. But, while there has been a fall in the overall number of searches, figures suggest a black person remains far more likely to be stopped by police than somebody who is white. Particular alarm has been raised over a police power known as Section 60. This allows officers to stop and search people and cars where they believe violence or disorder may be about to take place. A study by the Equalities and Human Rights Commission found police are ‘significantly’ more likely to use Section 60 of the Criminal Justice and Public Order Act against black people than white people. The power is used most often by the Metropolitan Police, which carried out three-quarters of the stops between 2008 and 2011 – 258,000 in total. The commission found that in 2008-09, the Met stopped 68 out of every 1,000 black people in its area. This fell to 32.8 per 1,000 by 2010-11. For all ethnic groups in England, it was 3.3 stops per 1,000 people in 2008/09, falling to 1.3 in 2010/11. The report also highlighted huge rates of ‘racial disproportionality’. An officer in the West Midlands was 28 times more likely to stop and search a black person than a white person in 2010/11. In Greater Manchester the figure was 21 times, in the Met 11 times, and for British Transport police it was 31 times. The most widely used stop and search power is Section 1 of the Police and Criminal Evidence Act. In 2010/11, it was used on 1,222,378 people. The 2011 census found that 86 per cent of the population classified themselves as white. But, according to the latest Home Office statistics, only 66 per cent of those stopped across England and Wales were white. Some 15 per cent were black and 10 per cent were Asian. The activities of the Met had a huge impact on the figures. In London (where just under 58 per cent of the population is white), only 43 per cent of those searched defined themselves as white. Three in ten were black, and 16 per cent were Asian. If the Met’s figures are stripped out of the nationwide statistics, 84 per cent of searches were on white people – broadly in line with the ethnic mix of the country. Last year, Dr Richard Stone, a member of the Stephen Lawrence inquiry panel, argued that officers who targeted suspects on grounds of their skin colour alone should be prosecuted for misusing public resources.","Stephen's brother Stuart Lawrence, 35, left furious by harassment .

"The fragile peace between India and Pakistan is once again under threat after two Indian soldiers were killed and 'mutilated' during fresh clashes at the Kashmir border. India claims Pakistani troops crossed into their territory yesterday and attacked Indian soldiers patrolling in the Mendhar region before retreating.

'Barbaric': India claims two soldiers were killed by Pakistani troops in Kashmir and their bodies mutilated (file picture) Disputed: India and Pakistan both claim the Kashmir territory but it is divided between them along a Line of Control (file photo) The violence was the second in three days in Kashmir after a Pakistani soldier was shot in a nearby area on Sunday. Pakistan alleged that Indian troops . crossed the cease-fire line in Sunday's attack. Both sides have denied . crossing into the other's territory. Both India and Pakistan claim the largely Muslim territory of Kashmir but it remains divided between them along a Line of Control (LoC). The countries, both nuclear powers, have . fought two wars over the Himalayan area but a cease-fire has largely held . for a decade. India summoned Pakistan's top diplomat in New .

"Lord Heseltine has warned David Cameron he would be taking a 'punt' by rushing into a referendum over Britain's membership of the EU. The former minister, known for his Europhile views - fuelled tensions in the Conserative Party by questioning the possibility of a national vote happening before negotiations over the EU's future have started. His comments came ahead of a hotly-anticipated speech by Mr Cameron on the union later this month. Warning: Former Conservative minister Lord Heseltine has told David Cameron he would be taking a 'punt' by rushing into a holding a national vote over Britain's future membership of the EU . Lord Heseltine, an adviser to the coalition on economic growth, said in The Times: 'Mrs Thatcher said ""Never go into a room unless you know how to get out of it"". 'To commit to a referendum about a negotiation that hasn't begun, on a timescale you cannot predict, on an outcome that's unknown, where Britain's appeal as an inward investment market would be the centre of the debate seems to me like an unnecessary gamble.' He added: 'If I was responsible for inward investment into any of our European colleagues, it would give me the best argument I could dream of. 'Why put your factory (in Britain) when you don't know - and they can't tell you - the terms upon which you will trade with us in future?' Labour seized on Lord Heseltine's comments. Shadow Shadow foreign secretary Douglas Alexander said: 'Even Michael Heseltine, the Prime Minister's own adviser on growth, thinks David Cameron's approach to Europe is bad for business and bad for Britain. 'The chorus of criticism is growing by the day. 'At a time when the priority should be jobs and growth, the Prime Minister sadly seems willing to put vital UK investment at risk for the sake of trying to keep his party united. 'Starting the year by edging Britain towards exit simply undermines confidence and prospects for growth - British business and even the Prime Minister's own adviser recognise this - when will he?"" Lord Heseltine was speaking after Chancellor George Osbourne suggested Britain would quit the EU unless Brussels agreed to major reforms, including the repatriation of a string of powers to the UK. Asked whether the UK would still be in the EU in ten years, Mr Osborne said: ‘I very much hope that Britain remains a member of the EU. But in order that we can remain in the European Union, the EU must change.’ The Chancellor’s explicit warning that Britain will quit the EU unless other member states agree to a major renegotiation of the relationship came in an interview with the German newspaper Die Welt. Collision course: David Cameron (left) and Lord Heseltine (right) have differing views over an EU referendum . It will pile pressure on David Cameron to follow suit when he makes his long-awaited speech on Europe later this month. Mr Cameron has said that life outside the EU is ‘imaginable’ but has suggested he is reluctant to include the option of leaving in any referendum. Coalition tensions on the issue were underlined last night when Liberal Democrat Business Secretary Vince Cable suggested the growing debate about Britain’s membership of the EU was damaging business confidence in the economy. Mr Cable said the issue was ‘a massive disruption and deeply unhelpful in my job’. He claimed that quitting the EU would result in the UK descending into the politics of economic protectionism and nationalism which the single market rules currently prevent. In a surprise intervention, the leader of the Conservatives in the European Parliament hit out at those in his own party demanding a hard line against Brussels. MEP Richard Ashworth said the strident Euroscepticism gave the impression of a Britain that was ‘snarling like a pitbull across the Channel’. He said Britain was ‘making ourselves look pretty darned unattractive’ as a partner in the EU. Discussing Mr Cameron’s ambition to claw back powers from Brussels, he said an ‘evolutionary solution’ was the way to proceed, rather than the ‘nuclear option’ of quitting the EU. Chancellor George Osborne has warned Europe Britain will leave the EU unless it changes . But Tory Eurosceptics  welcomed the Chancellor’s intervention. Former Cabinet minister John Redwood said Mr Cameron would get the best deal for Britain only if he made it clear the UK was otherwise prepared to quit. He urged the Prime Minister to hold an immediate referendum to give him a mandate to negotiate with Brussels, followed by a second referendum on the deal in which the British people would have the option to leave the EU. Mr Cable, in a speech at King’s College, London, made it clear the Lib Dems would resist any attempt to have a major renegotiation of Britain’s membership of the EU. The Chancellor’s comments came in an interview on Tuesday, but were only published yesterday. In the intervening period, both the US and Germany have warned Britain against holding a referendum on Europe. On Wednesday, US assistant secretary for European affairs Philip Gordon said the Obama administration wanted ‘a strong British voice’ in the EU and warned that referendums risked turning countries ‘inward’. The following day a key ally of German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a sharp warning that any attempt at ‘blackmailing’ member states into accepting change would backfire on Britain. Bundestag European affairs committee chairman Gunther Krichbaum said a referendum could leave the UK isolated  in Europe. A Treasury aide insisted that Mr Osborne’s comments were fully consistent with the Government’s position – that the EU needs to change ‘and indeed is changing’. Downing Street yesterday said that Mr Cameron had talked Barack Obama through Britain’s approach to Europe when they spoke before Christmas, and that the US president was supportive. ‘We want to change our  relationship with the EU and seek consent on that,’ the Prime Minister’s official spokesman said.","Former minister fuels Tory tension by urging Prime Minister to show caution .

"A callous taxi driver stole £300 from a blind woman after she asked him to help get money from a cash machine to pay the fare. Shafak Hussain, 36, had picked Jill Holland, 52, up from Manchester Royal Infirmary and was taking her back to her home in Oldham when she asked to stop at a cashpoint. When she asked him to key in £30 Hussain pressed £300 instead - giving Mrs Holland only the money she asked for and pocketing the rest, a court heard. Guilty: Shafak Hussain cheated a blind woman out of £300 when she asked for help at a cash machine . A regular of Hussain's taxi company Motown cars, Mrs Holland even gave him a £4 tip as well as the fare when he eventually dropped her home. But the next day she became suspicious of what had happened and rang her bank who revealed the £300 withdrawal. Father-of-two Hussain denied the accusation but was found guilty after a trial at Manchester Magistrates Court last month. He claimed he had taken the £300 out of the account with Miss Holland's . full knowledge and given it to her. Pick-up: Mrs Holland had been picked up by the taxi driver at Manchester Royal Infirmary after she was taken ill . Taxi driver Shafak Hussain was given a four month suspended prison sentence at Oldham Magistrates Court after being found guilty of stealing the money . Dominic Geelan, prosecuting, said: 'When arrested he was uncooperative and aggressive and accused the police of being racist.' The court heard that following the . offence, on August 5, Hussain had been shunned by colleagues . at Motown cars who were disgusted by his actions. He has . since had his licence revoked. District . Judge Paul Richardson told Hussain: 'I am glad to say you will never . work again as a taxi driver. Generally such drivers are worthy of the . trust put in them - but you are not. 'This was a very mean offence. She relied on you and you betrayed her.' Hussain, of Plymouth Street, Oldham, Greater Manchester, was given a four month suspended prison sentence, ordered to carry out 150 hours' unpaid work and told he must repay the stolen money to Miss Holland. Peter Etherall, defending, said . Hussain continued to maintain his innocence and would be lodging an . appeal against conviction and sentence. After the case Hussain, who was ordered to pay £625 costs, said he had put his house up for sale to fund his appeal.","Shafak Hussain, 36, took advantage of regular passenger Jill Holland .

"Poor you: Hatre cleric Abu Hamza's wife, Najat, has complained the extremist hasn't been able to use a comb in his American jail cell, where he awaits trial for 11 terror-related offences . The wife of hate preacher Abu Hamza has hit out at American prison authorities because they won't let her husband comb his hair. Muslim extremist Hamza was finally extradited from Britain last year and is in America awaiting trial on 11 terror-related offences. Wife Najat, who was discovered living on benefits with some of her seven children in Hammersmith, west London, last year, bleated on a website for Hamza's supporters over his treatment in his New York jail, where he is kept in solitary confinement for 23 hours a day. She writes: 'Since he’s been there his hair has not been combed due to a comb not being available for him.' According to the Sunday Express, she also moans at how he hasn't had any face-to-face meetings since his incarceration. Even when he meets lawyers, he cannot see them because they sit behind a glass screen with a curtain, she says. She writes: 'All this time he has remained in solitary confinement 23 hours a day in a small room with no window and no sunlight. 'For one hour, he is allowed to stretch his legs just next to his cell where there is not even enough room to even do that. 'He doesn’t even know the direction of the kibla (which indicates the direction in which Muslims must pray).' She says she has received few letters from him and he has been allowed to call her just once. Najat, who thanks 'all those brothers and sisters who have supported my husband for all these years', adds the cleric is still praying but is left to guess. Finally: Abu Hamza was extradited last year after a concerted campaign to have him gone. Here builders call for the hook-handed cleric to be deported back in 2004 . It has also been reported he is seldom allowed the use of his hook. She adds to his fans: 'Your help, love and concern for him has not gone unnoticed. Your reward is with Allah.' Hamza gained global notoriety for his fanatical sermons outside London’s Finsbury Park mosque after the 9/11 terror attack on New York. He was jailed on terrorism-related charges at high-security Belmarsh Prison in London. In the US he has denied facilitating violent jihad in Afghanistan and trying to set up a terrorist training camp in Oregon. Outrage: Hamza caused fury when he he praised the 9/11 attacks to a gathering outside Finsbury Park Mosque . He has also denied involvement in the 1998 kidnapping of Western tourists in Yemen, in which three Britons and an Australian died. Hamza, 54, was finally extradited to New York last October and is awaiting trial on 11 terrorism-related offences. It took Britain eight  years to get rid of him as he fought extradition to the US. The legal and prison bills cost taxpayers at least £1million.","Wife Najat bleats on website for Hamza's supporters .

"Being Prime Minister is at times like being stuck in a sitcom, David Cameron admitted today as he tore into the ‘enormous bureaucracy’ Whitehall produces. Mr Cameron said there were ‘elements of truth’ in shows like Yes, Prime Minister which chronicled the endless conflict between civil servants and their political masters. And he complained that even after almost three years in charge he is still frustrated at the amount of paperwork the government machine produces. David Cameron said there were 'elements of truth' about the political sitcom Yes, Prime Minister as he railed against the 'enormous bureaucracy' of life in Whitehall . One of Mr Cameron’s closest aides, policy guru Steve Hilton, lifted the lid on Whitehall life when he revealed the PM often only finds out what the government is doing by listening to the radio. The inability of No 10 to control government decisions was ‘pretty horrific’, Mr Hilton said. Mr Cameron admitted he agreed with much of Mr Hilton said. The PM said: ‘He’s right to say there’s an awful lot of bureaucracy and red tape and quangocracy.’ The sitcom Yes, Prime Minister returns to British TV screens tomorrow with the first new series for 25 years, chronicling the exasperation of PM Jim Hacker and his battles with mandarin Sir Humphrey Appleby. Mr Cameron admitted that real life in Number 10 mirrors art, with the fictitious comedy containing ‘elements of truth’ about his own experience in power. ‘Of course there are elements. In all of these programmes, there are always elements of truth, otherwise they wouldn’t be as funny and amusing as they are.’ He went on: ‘A lot of the paperwork that comes through government relates to the fact that we’ve got an enormous bureaucracy. ‘There are too many quangos, there are too many rules including those that are coming from Brussels, and we need to cut that back, we need to deregulate, we need to reduce the number of quangos – all of which we are doing.’ The Prime Minister said he had a good relationship with civil servants, ahead of Yes, Prime Minister returning to British TV screens tomorrow night, starring Henry Goodman and David Haig . But he was at pains to praise the civil service too, insisting: ‘I have a good relationship with the civil servants I work with. ‘It is a robust relationship, and we are changing the civil service – there are some radical reductions taking place, there’s a lot of reform taking place, but I would praise them for the work they do. ‘And I think in the end, if you have ministers who have a clear view of what they want to change in Britain, then you are capable of delivering it with our civil service.’ Painting a shambolic picture of the . Downing Street operation, Steve Hilton said the inability of No 10 to . control government decisions was ‘pretty horrific’. ‘Very . often you’ll wake up in the morning and hear on the radio or the news . or see something in the newspapers about something the Government is . doing,’ he said. David Cameron's former strategy guru Steve Hilton (left) has revealed that the Prime Minister often finds out about his own government's policies through the radio and in newspapers . ‘And . you think, well, hang on a second – it’s not just that we didn’t know . it was happening, but we don’t even agree with it! The Government can be . doing things... and we don’t agree with it? How can that be?’ Mr . Hilton revealed that ministers spend only 30 per cent of their time . dealing with the Government’s priorities, with 40 per cent spent . handling diktats from the European Union and the rest on ‘random . things... which were not anything to do with the coalition agreement’. He . described how No 10 is frequently left out of the loop as important . policy changes are pushed through by ‘paper-shuffling’ civil servants . who made life ‘impossible’ for ministers by drowning them in paperwork. ‘The bureaucracy masters the politicians,’ he said.","David Cameron admits there are 'elements of truth' in Yes, Prime Minister .

"Jodi Arias hid her face and wept today as the court was shown sexually explicit photos of her with ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander just hours before he was brutally murdered. Detective Michael Melendez told the Phoenix court on Monday that he had recovered the deleted pictures from the victim's camera. Arias shielded her face with her hair and touched her eyes with a tissue as the prosecution showed jurors naked photographs of the pair taken around 1.45pm on June 4, 2008. Several hours later, at 5.30pm, a series . of photographs show 30-year-old Alexander in the shower with the water . running. The images appeared to have been taken by someone else. Scroll down for video . Focused: Jodi Arias, pictured in court today, watches a police officer give information about photos allegedly deleted from her ex-boyfriend Travis Alexander's camera . Hidden: Arias shielded her face as the sexual nature of the pictures were discussed in court by the prosecution . Around 45 seconds later, according to the picture's time stamp, jurors were shown a photograph of the bathroom ceiling that appeared to have been taken unintentionally when the camera dropped. Less than a minute later, a grisly photograph  was taken which apparently depicts the back of Alexander's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck. It is alleged that it was mistakenly taken as Arias dragged her ex-lover's body through his Mesa home after stabbing him 27 times. A large dark obstruction in the foreground of the picture is a leg in sweatpants, the jury in Maricopa County, Arizona heard. The prosecution claims that the picture was . taken as Arias flew into a rage after learning her . ex-boyfriend wanted to date someone else. Intimate: A police detective found these deleted images on Alexander's camera . Seedy: The images from the camera were time-stamped as June 4, 2008 . Detective Melendez told the court that although pictures had been deleted from the camera, they remained on the hard drive. Earlier in the day, the jury watched . police interrogation tapes of Arias as she denied over and . over again that she had stolen a handgun and used it to kill her . ex-boyfriend. Arias . repeatedly told authorities that she had never seen the gun and did not . know her grandparents kept one at their home in Yreka, California until . it had been stolen. The .25-caliber gun went missing a week before Alexander was killed, during a break-in at the home Arias shared with her grandparents. Police told the court today that the burglary appeared 'odd' because only one gun was stolen out of four and piles of coins had not been taken. Caught: An image apparently shows the back of Travis Alexander's head with his arm raised as blood trickles down his neck. A leg in the foreground obstructs most of the image . Prosecutors have claimed that Arias repeatedly stabbed . Alexander in his shower before dragging him to his bedroom and slicing . his throat. She then allegedly took him back to the bathroom to shoot . him in the head. Two friends found his body in the shower on June 9, 2008, five days after he was killed. Defense attorneys say the trickling blood in the image is from Arias shooting Alexander in the head in self-defense, HLN reported. The prosecution alleges he was already dead when this wound was inflicted. Investigators found the grisly image on Alexander's camera, which had been thrown in the washing machine and put through a washing cycle with blood-soaked towels and clothes after his murder. 'Obsessed': Arias, 32, allegedly stabbed Travis Alexander, pictured, 27 times and shot him in the head . It is just one of many photographs . shown by prosecutors in the murder trial of the 32-year-old photographer . accused of killing her one-time boyfriend, a Mormon motivational . speaker. In the opening days of the trial last . week, the jury also saw blood-splattered scenes inside his home, as well . as blood stains in his bedroom carpet. They were also shown images of his horrifying wounds, including defensive wounds across his hands, and a neck wound so deep as she sliced his neck that it hit the bone. Arias wiped away tears as the . Maricopa County . medical examiner said Alexander 'may have' already been dead when she . shot him in the head - a key detail that could make way for the death . penalty. If . she did shoot Alexander after he was already dead it could qualify as a . 'heinous and depraved' murder, which would more likely send her to death row in Arizona. Mess: Prosecutors said it appeared as if someone had tried to wipe the blood away after the murder . Blood-soaked: Another image shows blood stains on the carpet near his bathroom in his bedroom . Blood soaked: Another image shows pools of blood. Some has been soaked up into a box in the closet . Yet the medical examiner said he could . not be fully certain Alexander was already dead from blood loss as the . body was already decomposing when it was found five days after the . killing. With the delicate brain tissue also . decomposing, he could not determine a bullet track through the skull or . how much hemorrhaging had occurred, which would signal whether Alexander . was still alive. While at first denying that she had even . seen him that day, Arias now admits to killing him but says she did so in self . defense after he had been abusive and possessive throughout their . relationship. Other images . on the camera show the pair, whom had kept up a sexual relationship . since breaking up after five months of dating in 2007, in sexually . explicit poses on the day of his murder. On Thursday, the prosecution attempted . to paint Arias as a serial liar by playing segments of interviews with . police and on Inside Edition where she protested her innocence. Scene: A pool of blood is seen in the bedroom; the prosecution is alleging this is where she slit his throat . Evidence: Another image apparently shows marks along the wall where Alexander's body was dragged . In the program, she claims she saw two men attack him, adding: 'No jury will convict me. Mark my words.' The portrayal builds on that suggested on Wednesday when another former flame, Ryan Burns, revealed Arias had lied about cuts to her hands when she arrived at his home 24 hours later. Burns testified on Wednesday that he had exchanged long emails and . phone calls with Arias after they met at a business conference in the spring of 2008. He invited her to his home in West . Jordan, Utah in June 2008 - and she arrived a day later than planned, . telling Burns she had got lost, driven the wrong way and slept in her . car for a while, he said. In fact, she had spent the previous day with Alexander, eventually murdering him out of 'self defense', she claims. New love: On Wednesday, Ryan Burns, left, . testified that Arias visited him at his Utah home 24 hours after she . killed Alexander - but she never mentioned the killing, despite claiming . it was out of self defense . Happier times: She met Travis Alexander, a Mormon and motivational speaker, at a Las Vegas conference . Yet . when she visited Burns the day after the murder, she never once . mentioned the ordeal she had supposedly been through the previous day, . he said in court. They kissed and joked, he said. When she arrived at his home, Burns noticed that she had bandaged hands, but she told him she had sustained the cuts after breaking a glass at her job at a Margaritaville, he said. But Det. Nathan Mendes, who worked at the Siskiyou County Sheriff's Office, said there was no Margaritaville in the county where she lived with her grandparents at the time. Burns added that he did not know Arias was still seeing Alexander when the two began talking and making plans to visit each other, ABC News reported. Prosecutors also exposed other lies . told by Arias after playing interviews with Mesa detective Esteban . Flores in which she said she last talked to Alexander on Tuesday night, . June 3, 2008. 'Last photo': Among the images on the camera was this one showing Travis in the shower before his death . Possessive: The jury was shown a picture of Arias in a t-shirt Alexander made reading 'Travis Alexander's' She claimed she had been in Los Angeles and was about to go to Utah. 'It was brief though, . 10 o'clock maybe,' she said. 'I'd say 10 p.m. or 9 - 9:30. I was calling people . because I was bored on the road. He was nice and cordial, but kind of . acting like he had hurt feelings. 'I may have called . him Wednesday, from the road, and I sent him a couple of text messages, . and a couple of pictures,"" she said, though Alexander didn't pick up because he had a full voice mailbox. 'That's unusual. He deletes all of his . messages. I didn't want to be obsessive about it because we're not . together anymore and I didn't like to call too much.' She added that she was shocked to learn of Alexander's death from one of his friends, and thought it must be a mistake. Alexander was found dead in his home in suburban Mesa on June 9, 2008 by two friends who went to check on him after he had been out of contact for days. Arias originally claimed she had not . seen Alexander the day of his murder, before claiming she had seen two . men kill him, before eventually saying that she killed him out of self defense. The couple had met at a work . conference in Las Vegas in September 2006 and began speaking on the . phone every day. Court records show they exchanged as many as 82,000 . emails. They started dating . in . February 2007 and, because Alexander was a Mormon, Arias chose to be . baptized into the church. But they broke up in June 2007, with Arias . telling police jealousy on both sides was to blame.

"A pensioner is lucky to be alive after blundering doctors failed to notice four times she had dentures stuck in her throat, leaving them lodged there for an amazing nine weeks. Umit Maddock, 46, of Braintree, Essex, has claimed it is a 'miracle' that her mother, Nermin Keating, survived after she swallowed her false teeth. Despite checking her over on four occasions doctors failed to spot the obstructing top set of 11 teeth. Astonishing: Umit Maddock, with her mother, Nermin Keating, whose dentures got stuck in her throat for 9 weeks and doctors failed four times to spot them . When the dentures first disappeared in early November 2012, science teacher Mrs Maddock assumed they had fallen out somewhere in the house that she shares with her mother. But when Nermin started feeling unwell, Mrs Maddock feared the worst and took her to St Michael's Hospital, Braintree the following day where doctors assured her there was no way that the teeth had been swallowed. They instead diagnosed her with a lung infection and prescribed her with antibiotics. During the following nine weeks, her mother continued to have problems, especially when she was eating. The pair visited Mount Chambers Surgery in Coggeshall three times Between November 13 and December 3 yet still the dentures were not spotted. It was only on their fourth visit to try to resolve why the pensioner was still unwell that a doctor Dr Noel Pereirafinally spotted them. Rescue: After nine weeks lodged in her throat Nermin Keating was rushed to Broomfield Hospital in Chelmsford, where doctors removed the top set of 11 teeth . Mrs Keating was immediately referred to Chelmsford's Broomfield Hospital where medics used a set of forceps to remove them. 'It's a miracle that mum even survived for so long with the dentures down her throat,' Mrs Maddock said. 'I can't quite believe what has happened - I was just so relieved when they came out. 'I almost feel guilty about what happened but my friends are telling me that I did what I could.' Mrs Maddock quit her teaching job at Alec Hunter Humanities College, Braintree, so she could become a full-time carer to her mother who has dementia and struggles to speak. Peter Hadfield, the practice manager at the Mount Chambers Surgery said he had never seen anything like it in his career. He said: 'It was an extraordinary find - very unusual. 'The patient had difficulty swallowing for quite some time and she had been seen by the out-of-hours service but her condition kept changing and nobody ever suspected the obstruction was a set of dentures. 'I have worked for all my career and I have never heard anything like this.'","Nermin Keating, 75, accidentally swallowed her top set of 11 teeth in November and then began to feel unwell .

"A chief constable quashed a criminal investigation into the multi-million pound Stobart transport empire while receiving free helicopter flights from them, a court heard yesterday. A court was told that Stuart Hyde, chief constable of Cumbria, personally pulled the plug on a £12million fraud investigation into the haulage firm at the same time as he accepted perks from the company thanks to his close friendship with senior managers. It was alleged the famous family firm - which was the focus of a Channel 5 TV series - was at the centre of an inquiry over the sale of Carlisle Airport. The High Court in Manchester was told the sale was fraudulent as an inflated price of £14million had been paid for the airport which was bought for £2million three years earlier, with the money going to two top officials at Stobart. Stuart Hyde pulled the plug on a £12m fraud investigation into the Stobart firm, it has been alleged, after receiving free helicopter rides from them . The court heard William Stobart, left, and Andrew Tinkler, right, ran WA Development International, which bought Carlisle Airport for £2m in 2006, before it was sold three years later for £14m to the Stobart Group . Former Stobart employee Peter Elliott told the court the airport was bought by WA Development International - a firm run by William Stobart and Andrew Tinkler - for £2million in 2006. But in 2009 Carlisle Airport was sold to the Stobart Group for £14million - a 700 per cent increase in valuation. Mr Elliott, 46, former aviation director at Stobart, claims an investigation into allegations the sale was the result of fraud was closed down by the chief constable. The court was told the chief constable had a close relationship with the haulage firm and had promoted the company on several occasions. Mr Elliott said: ‘Chief Constable Stuart Hyde had a relationship with Stobart that was simply not acceptable. Stobart provided the helicopter at no cost. ‘Mr Hyde has refused to provide details of how many times they used the helicopter. Stuart Hyde was promoting Stobart in the media while there was an investigation actively going on.’ It was alleged the famous family firm - which was the focus of a Channel 5 TV series - was at the centre of an inquiry over the sale of Carlisle Airport (file picture) Mr Elliott told the court he did not know how many times he believed the helicopter was used by the chief constable, or whether it was used for business or pleasure. The former aviation director - who left his £96,000 post in 2007 - said: ‘He should not have been promoting Stobart and using the helicopter for free.’ Cumbria’s chief constable was suspended in September over complaints about his management style and his ‘heavy-handed’ approach. Former Stobart employee Peter Elliott claims he is a whistleblower and has effectively been gagged by court orders and injunctions from telling the truth (file picture) A subsequent investigation by the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) cleared him of the allegations but he remains suspended while an investigation into gross misconduct continues. He said: ‘I remain deeply disappointed that my suspension continues. I look forward to the investigation concluding and I am absolutely committed to return to my role as Chief Constable and to serving Cumbria.’ The allegations were made in court as part of a long-running legal battle between the former aviation director and the haulage firm. Mr Elliott claims he is a whistleblower and has effectively been gagged by court orders and injunctions from telling the truth. He told the High Court said: ‘If a transaction between a private company and a public company that has pension fund investors is done at over value it is a fraud. It is not allowed in this country. ‘This is exactly what Robert Maxwell was doing. It goes against the very heart of the UK being the financial centre of the world.’ The Stobart Group, made famous by the cheery demeanour of its lorry drivers, has its origins in the late 1940s, when Eddie Stobart started a farming business which later expanded into the UK's best-known haulage company. Eddie's son Edward, who died of a heart attack two years ago, took over the firm in 1976. He retired in 2004, appointing his brother Michael as COO and Andrew Tinkler as CEO - allegations over the two executives are at the heart of Mr Elliott's case. Judge Mark Pelling said: ‘This case results from the unhappy difference between Mr Elliott and the claimant arising out of Mr Elliot’s employment as the claimant’s aviation director.’ Last night Cumbria Police declined to comment on the allegations. Deputy Chief Constable Bernard Lawson, from Merseyside Police, has taken over Mr Hyde’s role temporarily. Cumbria’s Police and Crime Commissioner Richard Rhodes said: ‘The allegations raised by Mr Elliott were considered by the Police Authority’s People and Performance Committee on 20 December 2011. Having considered the allegations the committee decided not to record a complaint.’ The hearing continues.

"A couple who disguised their £500,000 luxury house as a hay barn to outwit planning chiefs must tear down their home after losing the final round of a long-running legal battle. Property developer Alan Beesley and wife Sarah became locked in the dispute with local authority planners after moving into the two-storey home, but today admitted 'this is the end'. A last ditch attempt to overturn the council's orders that the property be demolished have failed. Last ditch: Alan Beesley and his wife Sarah must demolish the home hidden in a barn after losing a final appeal . The couple won permission to build the windowless barn to store hay 12 years ago, but fitted it out as a home - complete with a study, bathroom, lounge, gym and three-bedrooms. They lived there for four years before applying for the barn to be legally recognised as a home, but their actions incensed officers at Welwyn Hatfield Council in Hertfordshire. The couple were refused permission, sparking a dispute which went to the Supreme Court in 2011, when seven judges ruled they must leave the house. They said Mr Beesley had been dishonest and hatched a plan to 'mislead and deceive' planning bosses. The court ruled the couple could not live in the house and they moved out eight months ago. Costly: Mr Beesley revealed he has spent tens of thousands of pounds on the legal battle to keep his home . The council followed the ruling up with . enforcement notices ordering the barn to be pulled down - which prompted the couple's latest failed appeal. Mr Beesley, 41, and his 38-year-old . wife now have a year to move out and remove the building from the land . at Northaw, near Potters Bar. Mr Beesley has said his legal fight to remain in the house has cost him tens of thousands of pounds. Mr Beesley said today said: 'This is the end. We moved out of the house eight months ago. This latest appeal was not for the house, it was about the barn. Dispute: The couple have been locked in a long-running planning row with the council over the barn . 'They have ruled that we have to take the barn down as well. That is just the council for you.' In 2011, Mr Beesley had said the couple were 'absolutely devastated' and 'gutted'. He said they were 'in limbo' and that his wife was 'in pieces.' The couple built the house in Northaw, Hertfordshire, in 2001 and . moved in a year later. They hoped eventually to benefit from a rule . allowing homeowners who have lived in a property for more than four . years to stay - even if they do not have planning permission. Change of mind: Mr Beesley claimed that he originally had no intention of living in the building . Mr Beesley claimed that he originally had no intention of living in the building, but changed his mind after a spate of burglaries in the area. So he altered plans to relocate the large barn door and built extra doors and lighting, which were never approved by the council. In 2007, the couple applied for a certificate of lawfulness, which would allow them to use the property as residential accommodation. But planners objected and accused the couple of fraudulently building the home with the intention of living in it. In April 2009, the High Court ordered their eviction, but the decision was overturned in January 2010. All over: The Beesleys finally admitted today that the appeal decision marks the 'end' of the dispute . However, the Supreme Court reviewed the case in April 2011 and upheld the original judgment. They ruled that Mr Beesley intended to deceive the council from the outset to exploit a legal loophole by secretly using the building as a residential home for four years. A spokeswoman for Welwyn Hatfield Council said today: 'The council welcomes the appeal decision on the 'house in a barn.' 'We feel the decision is the right one, confirming the council's commitment to the enforcement of breaches of planning control.' The couple could not be reached for comment.","Alan and Sarah Beesley fail to overturn order that their home be demolished .

"Unrepentant: Retired civil servant Bill Worthington, 75, said he 'can't believe he has been taken to court' after he shot a squirrel which was stealing bird food from his back garden . After watching it raid his garden bird table once too often, Bill Worthington decided enough was enough. The retired civil servant set a trap for his bushy-tailed foe and lay in wait. It didn’t take long for the grey squirrel to take the bait and, with the animal cornered in the make-shift cage, the 75-year-old from Stockport, Greater Manchester, shot it twice with his air rifle. He went shopping but, when he returned two hours later, the animal was still alive so he shot it a further three times. Yesterday it emerged Worthington  is facing up to six months in jail or a £5,000 fine after being hauled before the courts for causing unnecessary suffering to the squirrel. The keen crown green bowler and bird lover was reported to the RSPCA by a neighbour who spotted the animal, maimed, but still alive in his garden. The five shots failed to kill the animal and it was later put down. Worthington pleaded guilty but told the hearing he had been ‘provoked’ by the activities of the squirrels, which he described as ‘garden rats’ and ‘vermin’. Speaking afterwards, he said: ‘I cannot believe I have been taken to court over this one grey squirrel, which, frankly, has been a pest and vermin. It does seem over the top. ‘I just wanted to keep my garden nice and feed the birds, yet these squirrels kept coming in and taking all the food. ‘They seem to wait in the trees until I’m not in the garden before striking. They dig up my garden and they eat the bird feed. In my mind they are a real problem. ‘I don’t want people to think I don’t like animals – far from it. I used to work on a farm years ago and I have a budgie called Peter who is marvellous, so clever.’ WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Bill Worthington claimed he was 'provoked' into shooting the squirrel after he repeatedly stole bird food from his garden . Bill Worthington has picked up the nickname the 'Verminator' for his squirrel-shooting exploits . It is legal to trap a non-domestic animal such as a grey squirrel but it must be killed humanely according to an animal welfare laws . A vet told the court Worthington should have taken the squirrel to a clinic to have it put down humanely . An x-ray shows the five pellets lodged in the dead squirrel after Worthington shot it with his air rifle from point blank range . Caught: Bill Worthington set a trap for the squirrel after it kept stealing food from the bird table in his garden. RSPCA officers turned up at his house in Bredbury, Cheshire, after being tipped off by a neighbour . Claire Aldridge, prosecuting, told . Stockport Magistrates’ Court that the RSPCA was alerted on September 27 . last year by a neighbour who had spotted the injured squirrel in the . garden of Worthington’s home, in Bredbury. She said: ‘The squirrel had been . trapped in a cage in the defendant’s garden. Worthington took his .22 . air rifle and shot at it two times. 'The defendant went shopping at approximately 11am and left the squirrel in the trap. 'Later when he returned, it was still grabbing at the cage and biting it. 'So the defendant shot the squirrel a further three times at around 2:30pm. He left the squirrel in the trap and went out.’ Grey squirrels originate from North America but were introduced to the UK throughout the 19th and 20th centuries . The grey squirrel originated in North America but was introduced to the UK throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Larger and more robust than the native red squirrel, it has now spread across England, Wales and Scotland and is regarded as a pest. The red squirrel used to be common but the population crashed because of greys spreading disease and taking their habitat. Black squirrels, the same species as greys, are now also thought to be increasing in number. Wild animals such as the grey squirrel are protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. They can be caught and killed legally including live-catch cage traps, approved spring traps or a specific rodenticide poison that is only approved for use against grey squirrels by a local authority or professional operator. However, such methods may not be legal in areas where red squirrels could also be at risk. For example, it can be an offence to kill, injure or take a red squirrel, or to damage or obstruct its place of shelter. If a live-catch trap is used, it must be checked several times a day and any captured grey squirrels humanely killed. It is an offence if any unnecessary suffering is caused to captured animals. In 2010 window cleaner Raymond Elliot became the first person in the country to prosecuted for causing harm to a non-domestic animal after he drowned a grey squirrel. Magistrates gave Mr Elliot a six-month conditional discharge and ordered him to pay £1,547 to cover investigation and legal costs incurred by the RSPCA. Countryside campaigners argue prosecuting people for killing pests is heavy-handed and expensive. The RSPCA doesn't recommend that members of the public try to capture and/or kill grey squirrel but contact a reputable pest controller instead. Worthington, who left to visit his . sick wife in a care home, said he assumed the animal was dead, but when . the RSPCA arrived at 4.20pm it was still alive. ‘The RSPCA recovered a live squirrel in the middle of the defendant’s garden,’ Miss Aldridge said. ‘This defendant shot a squirrel five . times over five hours. He said he didn’t care about the suffering of the . animal. The method of dispatch should be carried out humanely. 'What he did was unacceptably cruel and entirely unnecessary. He found it comical that the RSPCA were even investigating.’ Lee Strap, the vet who eventually put down the animal, confirmed it had multiple pellet wounds and was alive but unresponsive. When questioned by RSPCA officers Worthington was described as ‘obtrusive’. He confirmed he was a user of a .22 rifle and referred to the squirrels as ‘vermin’ and ‘garden rats’. Worthington, defending himself, . added: ‘We are talking about one squirrel here. The vet says the . squirrel was “alive but not responsive”. That’s how I saw it. I tried my . best to have away with it but I had other things to do.’ Magistrates granted Worthington unconditional bail. He will be sentenced next month. The grey squirrel was caught in a trap before Worthington shot it five times with an air rifle. It was taken to a vets where it had to be put down .

"A mixture of beef and horse offcuts found in contaminated burgers sold in supermarkets could have been used for a year, the Food Standards Agency (FSA) has said today. The contaminated meat was in the form of blocks of frozen product from a Polish supplier which had been used for a year, FSA chief executive Catherine Brown told the Commons Environment Committee. Investigations are going on into how long contaminated meat might have been in use, Ms Brown told MPs. Scroll down for video . Burgers were pulled off the shelves at Tesco after the supermarket discovered that there were traces of horse meat in their products . Asked how UK consumers could know if horse meat had not been in burgers 'for months, if not years', Ms Brown replied: 'We haven't (in the past) identified horsemeat in burgers as a likely significant risk in this country, and therefore it is possible... and that's why I'm saying that it's very important now that we get to the bottom of the Polish connection and the Irish investigation because it is possible that these burgers have been on sale in this country. 'The probable limit of possibility... is a year because it's been a year that this supplier has been supplying. 'And therefore when the Polish get to the bottom of this we will hope to know whether it's likely that this has been going on for a year.' Meat in Tesco burgers which was found . to contain horse DNA did not come from a list of approved suppliers, the . supermarket also admitted today. The meat also came from outside the UK or Ireland, which was contrary to the supermarket's policy. The supermarket has now dropped its frozen burger supplier, Silvercrest, following what it termed a 'breach of trust'. It has vowed to introduce a DNA testing system on meat products to 'ensure the quality' of the food on its shelves in the wake of the scandal that has disgusted customers. It said: 'We now understand - with as much certainty as possible - what happened. 'The evidence tells us that our frozen burger supplier, Silvercrest, used meat in our products that did not come from the list of approved suppliers we gave them. 'Nor was the meat from the UK or Ireland, despite our instruction that only beef from the UK and Ireland should be used in our frozen beefburgers. 'Consequently we have decided not to take products from that supplier in future. We took that decision with regret but the breach of trust is simply too great.' Tesco was forced to issue a public apology earlier this month after tests in Ireland discovered traces of horse meat in three frozen beefburger lines. The findings sparked a national outcry and 10 million burgers were pulled from shelves as a result of the scandal. The supermarket launched an investigation into how the meat ended up in stores in the UK and Ireland on January 16. Dropped: Tesco says it has dropped supplier Silvercrest Foods after the 'breach of trust' Today it promised to set a 'new standard' with the introduction of a testing system designed to detect 'any deviation from our high standards'. It issued a statement saying: 'We made a commitment to customers to investigate thoroughly and share the findings with them. Since then, we have been working hard to understand what happened and how we can stop it ever happening again.' It added: 'Ultimately Tesco is responsible for the food we sell, so it is not enough just to stop using the supplier. 'We have a well-equipped, expert technical team and world-class checks in place but we will not take anything for granted after this incident. 'It has shown that, in spite of our stringent tests, checks and controls there remained a small possibility that something could go wrong and it did. We want to stop it ever happening again, so we are taking action to reduce that possibility still further. 'To underpin the strong measures already in place, we will now introduce a comprehensive system of DNA testing across our meat products. This will identify any deviation from our high standards. 'These checks will set a new standard. 'It will be a significant investment for Tesco, borne by Tesco. We want to leave customers in no doubt that we will do whatever it takes to ensure the quality of their food and that the food they buy is exactly what the label says it is.' Tesco Everyday Value beefburgers were removed after it was discovered they contained horse meat . The controversy surrounding Tesco extended to Dunnes Stores, Lidl, Aldi and Iceland after some of their products were also found to contain low levels of horse DNA. The furore deepened further last week when it emerged a potentially carcinogenic drug may have entered the food chain following the slaughter of horses in the UK. Shadow environment secretary Mary Creagh told the Commons that some of these animals tested positive for the carcinogen phenylbutazone, commonly known as bute. She said: 'I am in receipt of evidence showing that several horses slaughtered in UK abattoirs last year tested positive for phenylbutazone, or bute, a drug which causes cancer in humans and is banned from the human food chain. 'It is possible that those animals entered the human food chain.' The Commons Environment Committee is due to take evidence on the contamination of beef products with horse meat later today. Food which tested positive was found to have been produced by Liffey Meats and Silvercrest Foods in Ireland and the UK plant, Dalepak Hambleton. A statement released earlier this week by ABP Food Group, which owns Silvercrest, issued an apology and said they had appointed a new management team at the supplier and they will also introduce new DNA tests. Paul Finnerty, Group Chief Executive, ABP Food Group said: 'This has been a very difficult experience for all involved and has led to a significant interruption in business for Silvercrest and its customers. We are relieved that the source of the problem has been identified.' 'While the company has never knowingly purchased or traded in equine product, I wish to take this opportunity to apologise for the impact this issue has caused.' 'As previously stated the company has never knowingly bought or processed horse meat and all of our purchases are from approved and licensed EU plants.' Tesco has won praise from the Government and MPs after announcing it would step up its food tracing procedures in the wake of the discovery of horse meat in beef burgers. Environment minister David Heath said he 'welcomed' the supermarket's announcement, which also won praise from shadow minister Huw Irranca-Davies. Mr Irranca-Davies also welcomed the move towards DNA testing, which Labour has called on the Government to instigate. He told MPs: 'It is a welcome innovation, it is what we should be seeing more of, it's what the NFU and others are calling for more of and it shows the extent to which we now need to be far more rigorous than we used to. 'It's not the same world it was 20 years ago.' Mr Irranca-Davies said increased globalisation in meat supply had reinforced the need for more stringent checks on meat products. And he pressed the minister to also update MPs on how horse meat was checked for medical contamination, after evidence emerged horse meat may have entered the food chain after testing positive for phenylbutazone, or bute. But Mr Heath said sampling and results for bute can take up to three weeks - meaning it's 'entirely possible' that in that time the meat could be taken abroad and consumed. He did say the Food Standards Agency are investigating the bute claims and will take action if necessary.","Contaminated meat was in blocks of frozen product from a Polish supplier, FSA said .

Family friend Diane Pullin, from Kingswood, Bristol, said she got to know the couple because her son-in-law Darren worked for Mr Simons’ father. 'They are a lovely family, so kind and so helpful,' she said. 'They don’t deserve this. They’d just had news that they were able to have fertility treatment... everything to live for. 'It’s just terrible and it shouldn’t have happened. 'Two young people with their lives in front of them... snapped away just like that. 'They were trying for children and they had just been told they could have fertility treatment. 'Everything to live for, they were such a lovely family.' Mrs Pullin said her daughter Shelley and son-in-law Darren had been out for a meal on Saturday night with Mr and Mrs Simons. 'They desperately wanted children and it wasn’t happening,' Mrs Pullin said. 'They’d just been given the go-ahead. They were so happy on Saturday night. 'My daughter says she’s got helium balloons at the top of her stairs wishing them luck and she can’t even look at them. 'Like she said to me just now, ‘How can I be with them on Saturday night and they’re not here now?’. It just shows that nobody knows. No-one could have thought this on Saturday night. 'It’s just so sad. It’s all I can really say. Such a waste of a life. All these questions of ‘why?”' Mr and Mrs Simons 'could never do enough for anybody', a family friend said as he laid flowers at the scene . A neighbour, who did not wish to be named, said they were on their way for a meal at Clare's parents' house when tragedy struck. He said: 'They only bought the tandem a few weeks ago and hadn't used it much. 'They previously had separate mountain bikes but they were stolen from the house so they bought the tandem to replace them. I think this was one of the first times they'd been out on it. 'Ross built a garage at the house to securely keep the tandem. I believe . they were were heading to Clare's family for tea when it happened. 'Both of their families live in that direction but I spoke to Clare's . dad yesterday evening and he was worried because he hadn't heard from . them and they hadn't turned up for the meal. 'Ross's dad called this morning and told me what had happened. He was extremely upset and crying down the phone. Police cars in Lower Hanham Road on Sunday after the two cyclists were killed .

'I have two little ones and whenever they had a barbecue in the summer they would always ask us round. 'They were brilliant, you couldn't ask for better neighbours. They would do anything for anyone. This is terrible news. 'It is such a dreadful thing to happen to such a lovely couple.' Speaking after laying flowers family friend Steve Camm said: 'They were like two peas in a pod. 'They were never apart. They could never do enough for anybody. They were caring people.' Mr Camm said Mr and Mrs Simons had been married for about 18 months. 'They always did random stuff. You could never stop them from having fun,' he said, 'It's devastating.' People continued to leave floral tributes at the scene. One read: 'Ross and Clare you were an amazing couple and fantastic people. You will be missed so so much by all. RIP gone but never forgotten. In our hearts forever. All our love Darren, Shelley and Joshua xxx.' Another tribute read: 'Ross and Clare. You will always be in our hearts.'You will truly be missed and never forgotten. All our love, Paul and Sharon xxx.' A map shows the location of where a man and woman were knocked off their bikes by a driver in Hanham . Locals living in the predominately residential street spoke of their shock that a hit-and-run could happen in the area. Rev Peter Cook, of Hanham Baptist Church, said: 'I think it is shock and incomprehension. It has ripped the community to its heart. 'I was just told about it when I was about to start my evening service and I really thought the person telling me was having me on. 'We stopped the service and prayed for what was going on - it seemed just so implausible. 'You don’t expect it happening on a Sunday afternoon when you are out for a cycle. I think it was totally out of the ordinary and that’s why people are so shocked by it. 'I know lots and lots of people in the community are praying for them and we want to give their families our deepest sympathies. 'We can’t imagine what it’s like to lose two people like this.' Inspector Frazer Davey, from the collision investigation team, said: 'Following investigations overnight, the circumstances of this collision have become much clearer. 'However, I would appeal to anyone who witnessed this incident or saw this car in the area shortly before the collision to come forward and contact us. 'This is a tragic incident in which two people have needlessly lost their lives. Our thoughts and deepest sympathies are with their families.'

"One modest lump can fetch a small fortune. A large piece can turn its finder into a millionaire. It’s the most valuable organic substance known to man — and you can find it from nothing more strenuous than a walk on the beach. This week, Ken Wilman was strolling on Morecambe Bay with his dog when he spotted something odd: a fatty, smelly lump. He thought little more of it until he got home and decided to act on a hunch. Ken Wilman found a lump of rare whale vomit or 'ambergris' on Morecambe beach when he was walking his dog . He Googled ‘ambergris’ and hit the jackpot. ‘There’s gold out there on the beach!’ he proclaimed on Radio 4 yesterday. ‘Floating gold!’ Ken has already been offered £43,000 for his find. Last year, eight-year-old Dorset schoolboy Charlie Naysmith found a similar deposit near Bournemouth, said to be worth £40,000. But just what is this weird substance that has made them rich? The truth is even stranger than you might think — and takes us from the deepest ocean to the glamour of fashion, and from the stuff produced in the belly of the biggest predator that ever lived to the most delectable fragrance human beings have devised. That predator is the sperm whale: the . monumental leviathan and real-life model for Moby-Dick. Sperm whales . suffer under many misapprehensions and superlatives. It is they — not polar bears, as a . recent BBC documentary insisted — who are the greatest predator. They . are bigger even than any carnivorous dinosaur. They also possess the . largest brain of any animal (quite what they do with it is another . matter). Ken Wilman's dog Madge dug up the smelly substance which turned out to be whale dung . And as Mr Wilman’s find proves, these . incredible animals also excrete (rather than vomit, as most media . coverage would have you believe), the world’s most valuable dung — since . that is what ambergris is. It . is a kind of cholesterol that forms around the by-product of a sperm . whale’s main food source, squid — the hard beaks of which occasionally . get caught in the animal’s lower gut. Hunted . or stranded whales that have been cut open have been found with tens of . thousands of such beaks, which are shiny black snapping mechanisms like . parrot’s beaks and composed of keratin, like human fingernails. As they snag in the whale’s . intestines, the sticky, fatty ‘cholesterol’ forms around them, like . pearls forming around pieces of grit in oysters. Some lumps of ambergris . may contain many squid beaks. The . biological reason for this may be to protect the whale’s gut from . ulcers. But it seems to happen in just one in 100 whales — one per cent . of the population. There are around 360,000 sperm whales in the world, . so that’s quite a lot of ambergris floating about. The coalescing lump is expelled as . dung. Probably with relief: sperm whale poo is usally a runny red cloud . in the water (and rather odiferous in its own way, as I can attest, . having been next to a young whale when it decided to discharge in my . direction). Lighter than . water, the ambergris floats and matures in the sea,  turning from a . sticky brown mass to a grey, waxy, shiny blob. Hence its name from the . French for ‘grey amber’, after the golden, fossilised resin that is . often found on the Baltic’s shores. For centuries ambergris has been imbued . with wonderful properties. The ancient Chinese called it  ‘dragon’s . spittle fragrance’ and used it to spice their wine, believing it to be . an aphrodisiac. Sperm whales excrete the world's most valuable dung, known as ambergis . Sperm whales can grow up to 18 metres and their dung has been used as an aphrodisiac . In the Middle Ages, it was burned as incense and as a preventative against plague. In . Milton’s Paradise Lost, Satan tempts Christ with ‘Grisamber steamed’. Aristocrats of the Renaissance wore it moulded, dried and decorated as . jewellery. Charles II used . to eat it with his eggs, rather in the way an epicure might now shave . truffle over an  omelette. Sailors, with readier access to the stuff, . had a more prosaic use for it: they employed it as a laxative. When researching my book on whales, I . was made privy to the secret formula for the sacred oil used to anoint . British monarchs in the coronation ceremony. In . the private library set high in the upper storey of Westminster Abbey, I . was shown a recipe handed down over the centuries: Oleaum Praescriptum . Ad Ungendum in Coronatione Carolum 1 Britannae Regem. Sperm whales can grow up to 18 metres and their dung can be used as an aphrodisiac . Along with oils of jasmine, rose and . cinnamon, Ambraegristiae is listed as well as the exact amount required. But Queen Victoria objected to the smell so much that she washed it off . immediately on her return from the Abbey. It . was in the mid-Atlantic archipelago of the Azores — where I had my own . close encounters with the  magnificent sperm whales — that I got to . smell ambergris. There, Dr . Malcolm Clarke, a British scientist working on the island of Pico, . handed me a small plastic box. When I opened it, the smell hit me. But inside was what looked like just a . lump of mud. The aroma is almost indescribable — peaty, earthy, with . undertones of dung, but incredibly powerful and elusive at the same . time, with a lingering after-smell I can only compare to pure patchouli, . the oil much favoured by hippies in the Sixties. It stayed on my fingers for three days, and a smear of it still scents my notebook. Herman . Melville, who devoted a whole chapter to it in Moby-Dick, wrote: ‘Who . would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale . themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a whale! Yet so it is.’ And indeed the quality of scent is why ambergris is highly prized — although not the only reason. It is also valued by the perfume industry for its extraordinary ability to capture other, more fugitive scents. It is the perfect fixative, for which no synthetic substitute has been found, and it ensures that perfumes retain their smell. Modern chemical analysis shows the active element is ambrien, a crystalline, fatty cholesterol that slows the evaporation of volatile oils. Molecular chemistry, as sophisticated as it is, still cannot replicate ambrien’s complexity. That explains the secretive trade in this strange substance — and the inflated sums paid for good, pure samples. The beach that's paved with gold: Morecambe bay was where Ken Wilman found a valuable lump of whale dung . The large lump of whale dung was found washed up at Morecambe Bay in Lancashire . Ambergis like that found on Morecambe beach is valued at around £800/lb . In 1891, fisherman Louis Smith actually climbed into the belly of a dead whale in Tasmania — like a latter-day Jonah — to dig out a boulder-sized piece of ambergris. It weighed 162 lb, 11 oz, and fetched him £11,000. That’s more than half-a-million pounds in today’s money. More recently, a huge lump was found in south-western Australia that was worth £100,000. Today, a large, 30kg lump can keep a perfume house supplied for 20 years, at a cost to them of around £500,000. But the quality varies greatly, hence the fluidity of its price. Ambergris sells at an average of around £800 per pound on the international market — although the best pieces can fetch much more. The smooth, white boulders demanded by Chanel and Dior, Yves St Laurent and Givenchy command the highest prices. The lucky finders of these elusive specimens can name their price. Even now there are men living on remote beaches who dedicate their lives to looking for ambergris. Ambergis is used in perfumes such as Chanel No 5 . American molecular biologist Christopher . Kemp set out to trace the sometimes dark and even sinister trail of . ambergris in his compelling book Floating Gold. He found piratical exponents of the art of finding it on far-flung Stewart Island, a New Zealand possession in the Pacific Ocean. His inquiries there were met with stone walls of silence — and even vague threats of violence. No one wanted to give away their secrets. One trader made it clear to  Kemp that the ambergris he supplied formed the basis for such famous scents as Chanel No 5 and Guerlain’s Shalimar. Creed’s of London, one of the world’s oldest perfumers, has been making whale-infused perfumes for centuries. One was worn by Prince Louis Napoleon in the 19th century. More recently, another was made especially for English-born Hollywood star Cary Grant. Having smelt ambergris myself, I can now identify it in perfumes. Sometimes I’ll walk into a party  and immediately know someone is wearing it. When you read that a perfume has ‘amber undertones’, you may be sure it owes them to ambergris. Truly, this is an amazing journey. A substance born in the guts of an  animal that spends most of its time in the deepest seas ends up on  the counter of your local department store. So check your own perfume. You may be wearing the smell of whale poo today.","Cholesterol forms on squid remnants inside sperm whales before excretion .

"A bureau de change boss who recruited his wife and son to help clean up nearly £170 million-worth of criminal cash has been jailed for nine years. Ussama El-Kurd, 64, known as 'Sammy the Kurd' in underworld circles, was on bail pending an appeal for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006. He enlisted his wife Randa, 51, and son Husain, 22, to help run the Kensington Money Exchange in upmarket Notting Hill, west London. Ussama El-Kurd, known as 'Sammy the Kurd', was on bail for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006 . Their efforts allowed the proceeds of drug dealing, violent robberies and other major crimes to be spent freely by offenders. The Palestinian-born family ran their 'bespoke money laundering service' in Kensington Church Street. No records of the dodgy transactions were kept, but authorities say the business must have helped to wash at least £169m until it was shut down in 2010. They estimate just one-sixth of the trade carried out at the store was legitimate. Ussama El-Kurd wept as he was led away to the cells to begin a nine-year jail term after a judge told him he had caused 'harm on a truly major scale.' Mr Justice Irwin told him: 'That volume of money laundering represented the proceeds of no doubt drug dealing, no doubt extortion, no doubt robbery and violence and all the other aspects of major crime. Mother and son: Husain El-Kurd (left) and Randa El-Kurd (right) were convicted at Southwark Crown Court . 'You began this offending while on bail for an appeal and then facing a potential retrial for your previous offending. 'You defied the courts when you began this offence.' He was found guilty of a near-identical offence in 1999 and jailed for 14 years - though the conviction was later quashed on appeal. The new venture was set up following his release in April 2006. El-Kurd's wife Randa was jailed for ten months for turning a 'blind eye' to his deception while listed as a director of the firm. She claimed she had not attended court during the earlier trial and had tried to shield her family from publicity. But the court heard she was well-versed in the business world, having set up her own property firm in west London. Kensington Money Exchange where Sammy the Kurd recruited his wife and son to help money launder . The judge said he accepted she had played no part in the money laundering itself, but added: 'You turned a deliberate blind eye to what your husband was doing. 'He may have told you he was carrying on business legitimately but you didn't check.' Brunel University student Husain El-Kurd was recruited to work as a delivery driver and man the store while his parents were on holiday. He pleaded to be spared jail so he could continue his studies in international management. But he also received a ten-month jail term and was told he had played an 'active role' in the enterprise. He and his mother embraced in the dock as their sentences were read out. Ussama El-Kurd was banned from acting as a company director for ten years, his wife for five years and his son for three years. Annie Conway, specialist prosecutor for the CPS organised crime Division, said: 'Ussama El-Kurd was laundering criminals' money on a truly industrial scale. 'He made a considerable living cleaning dirty money and helping organised criminals go undetected. 'With the help of his wife and son, El Kurd ran what appeared to be an inconspicuous money exchange shop on Kensington Church Street. The shop was a magnet for criminals who changed up to £150million in Euros before spiriting it away . 'But the shop was a magnet for criminals who changed up to £150 million into Euros before spiriting it away. 'Today's sentencing stops not just these three criminals, but all those who relied on the El-Kurds to enjoy a criminal lifestyle.' Brendan Foreman, SOCA Regional Head of Investigations, said: 'This was no legitimate business venture, it was simply an enterprise designed to enable criminals to prosper while living lives of luxury in foreign jurisdictions both near and far. 'El Kurd has personally profited and the considerable assets he managed to accrue will now be pursued through the courts. 'This investigation will have had a significant impact on organised crime groups operating in the UK and overseas. 'Many have had their criminal proceeds seized whilst others have been denied access to a money laundering mechanism that operated under the guise of a legitimate business on a UK high street.' Usamma El-Kurd, of Lynwood Road, Ealing, west London, admitted conspiracy to conceal, disguise, convert, transfer or remove criminal property from the UK. His son, of the same address, admitted failing to disclose suspicious transactions. Randa El-Kurd admitted neglecting her role as a company director, contrary to the 2007 Money Laundering Regulations.","Ussama El-Kurd was on bail for a previous money laundering conviction when he set up the business in 2006 .

"A British woman who was raped at knifepoint and left for dead said she ‘couldn’t be happier’ after her attacker was jailed for 23 years yesterday.

"Laid to rest: Julia Pastrana, billed as the 'world's ugliest woman' in the 19th century, will finally be buried in Mexico, 153 years after her death . A woman branded the 'ugliest woman in the world' after a rare disease left her body covered in hair has finally returned to her birthplace in Mexico for a proper burial - 153 years after her death. Julia Pastrana was exploited as part of a traveling exhibition through Europe until she died from complications of childbirth in 1860. Even after her death, her body was exhibited across the world. It eventually ended up in a storage room at an Oslo research institute, and after learning of the body's whereabouts, visual artist Laura Anderson Barbata campaigned to have it returned to Mexico. 'I felt she deserved the right to regain . her dignity and her place in history, and in the world's memory,' Barbata, who learned Pastrana's story while working on a play about her life, told the New York Times. 'I hoped to help change . her position as a victim to one where she can be seen in her entirety . and complexity.' Barbata, . who lives in New York but hails from Mexico City, eventually won her . decade-long battle and on Tuesday, Pastrana's body will finally be . buried in Sinaloa de Leyva. Pastrana was born in Mexico in 1834 and suffered from congenital terminal hypertrichosis, . which left her face and body covered in thick hair. She also suffered from gingival hyperplasia, . which made her lips and gums thick. She was not diagnosed with either condition in her lifetime. In . 1854, she was bought by a Mexican customs administrator and he began . exhibiting her through the U.S. and Canada. While in New York, she . married Theodore Lent, who became her manager. Historians . believe that while she was in love with Lent, he only married her to . control her earnings, the New York Times reported. Heading home: A coffin containing Pastrana's remains upon arrival at Culiacan airport on Monday . Lent . toured his wife, whom he called a 'bear woman', through Europe. Critics . called her 'revolting in the extreme' and doctors said she was the . result a human mating with an 'Orang Outang'. But she is also documented in 19th century history books as having an affinity for singing, music, dancing and languages, as well as great generosity to local charities. In 1859, she fell pregnant and her son inherited her hypertrichosis and died 35 hours after his birth. Pastrana died from complications of the birth five days later - aged just 26. But the death did not stop Lent, and he began exhibiting his wife and son's embalmed bodies propped up a in glass cabinet. Exploited: Pastrana, who was born with a rare disease that left her body covered with hair, was advertised as a 'bear woman' as she toured Europe with her husband and manager Theodore Lent . Ridicule: She also suffered from gingival hyperplasia, which made her lips and gums thick . Julia Pastrana suffered from congenital terminal hypertrichosis, . which left her face and body covered in an abnormal amount of thick hair. This form of extreme hair growth is most responsible for the term 'werewolf syndrome'. There is no cure for any congenital forms of hypertrichosis, and an affected female has a 50 per cent change of passing it to her offspring - as Julia did to her son. This type of hypertrichosis is usually accompanied by gingival hyperplasia, which makes the person's lips and gums thicker due to an overgrowth of gum tissue. Julia also suffered from this. She was not diagnosed with either condition in her lifetime. He later married a bearded woman in Mexico and billed her as Pastrana's sister 'Zenora Pastrana'. After his death in a Russian mental institution in 1884, the bodies continued to be featured at exhibitions until thieves broke into a warehouse owned by a fairground in Norway in 1976 and stole them. The remains were later found by police in a trash bin; Pastrana's arm had been dismembered and her son's body could not be salvaged. In 1996, her body was taken to the Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Oslo, where she was placed in storage. 'By ending up as part of a collection in a . basement, she lost any trace of dignity,' Barbata said. 'My . ultimate dream goal was that she should go back to Mexico and be . buried.' Barbata learned of . Padtrana's sad resting place while designing costumes for a play her . sister, Kathleen Anderson Culebro, produced in Texas: The True History of the Tragic Life and Triumphant Death of Julia Pastrana, the Ugliest Woman in the World. In 2005, she began petitioning the University of Oslo to return the body to Mexico, and in 2008, she made her case to Norway’s National Committee for the Evaluation of Research on Human Remains. On show: Even after her death from childbirth, Pastrana was embalmed and exhibited next to her dead son . Help: Her body has now returned to Mexico after a decade-long campaign by New York-based artist Laura Anderson Barbata (pictured second left) In June last year, they agreed 'it seems quite unlikely that Julia Pastrana would have wanted her body to remain a specimen in an anatomical collection'. The current governor of Sinaloa, Mario López Valdez, then joined the cause last year, and the Mexican ambassador to Norway, Martha Bárcena Coqui, offered to work with the university. The institute agreed to start the process transferring the body to Mexican custody last August, and last week, Barbata confirmed Pastrana's identity before her coffin was sealed. During the check, she saw that bolts remained in Pastrana's feet, and they were removed. Pastrana will be buried on Tuesday in a cemetery in Sinaloa de Leyva, near to her birthplace.","Julia Pastrana had a condition that left her entire body covered in hair .

"They are the moving words from a poem written at the start of the First World War and are still spoken every Remembrance Sunday. ‘They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old: Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn. At the going down of the sun and in the morning we will remember them.’ Known as the Ode of Remembrance, the verse is from Lawrence Binyon’s 1914 poem For The Fallen which paid homage to the dead as British casualties mounted on the Western Front. Poignant: The copy of the last stanza from For the Fallen that was handwritten by its author Lawrence Binyon . Rare: A handwritten copy of the Ode of Remembrance by poet Lawrence Binyon (right) is to go on sale at auction. Binyon may have scrawled the copy for a soldier serving amid the horror of the front line . The manuscript which will be auctioned at Bonhams is expected to be sold for £8,000 . With proud thanksgiving, a mother for her children, . England mourns for her dead across the sea.Flesh of her flesh they were, spirit of spirit,Fallen in the cause of the free.Solemn the drums thrill: Death august and royalSings sorrow up into immortal spheres.There is music in the midst of desolationAnd a glory that shines upon our tears.They went with songs to the battle, they were young,Straight of limb, true of eye, steady and aglow.They were staunch to the end against odds uncounted,They fell with their faces to the foe.They shall grow not old, as we that are left grow old;Age shall not weary them, nor the years condemn.At the going down of the sun and in the morningWe will remember them.They mingle not with laughing comrades again;They sit no more at familiar tables of home;They have no lot in our labour of the day-time;They sleep beyond England's foam.But where our desires are and our hopes profound,Felt as a well-spring that is hidden from sight,To the innermost heart of their own land they are knownAs the stars are known to the Night;As the stars that shall be bright when we are dust,Moving in marches upon the heavenly plain,As the stars that are starry in the time of our darkness,To the end, to the end, they remain. Now a rare copy of the verse, handwritten by Binyon during the war, is set to fetch £8,000 when it is sold at auction by Bonhams in London on April 10. Binyon – too old to enlist, but who volunteered as a medical orderly – may have scrawled the copy, which is being sold by a collector of manuscripts, for a soldier serving amid the horror of the front line. A spokesman for Bonhams, which is selling the manuscript, said: 'The copy for sale was written some time before 1918 on British Expeditionary Force (BEF) headed note-paper. 'When For the Fallen was first published in The Times in September 1914, casualties had started to mount and the promise of a speedy end to the war was already fading. 'The poem, and its final verse in particular, became and remains today a dignified and elegiac expression of national grief.' The verse is being sold by Roy Davids, a collector of poetical manuscripts and a renowned expert. No manuscript containing any part of For The Fallen has been sold at auction for at least 40 years. Only six manuscripts of the poem are known to exist. Lawrence Binyon was born in Lancaster in 1869. At Oxford University he won the Newdigate prize for poetry and was influenced by the work of William Wordsworth. Binyon published two major volumes of poetry: Lyric Poems (1894) and Odes (1901). He wrote For the Fallen while working at the British Museum and did not go to the Western Front until 1916 when he went as a Red Cross orderly. After the Armistice, Binyon returned to the British Museum printed books department where he was in charge of Oriental prints and paintings. He was appointed Norton professor of poetry at Harvard in 1933. The poet's later work included a translation of Dante's Divine Comedy before he died in 1943.

"Almost 30,000 council pen-pushers now earn more than £50,000 a year. Taxpayers fork out £1.9billion a year on the high salaries, at a time when town halls are cutting frontline services and blaming the Government’s cuts. Despite the age of austerity, 118 councils have actually increased the number of staff taking home more than £50,000. Birmingham City Council - the largest authority in England - had the largest increase in the number of staff on more than £50,000 salaries . Last night, the Tories said the figures, from a report by the Taxpayers’ Alliance, showed there was plenty of scope for councils to make savings without hitting services for the vulnerable. But of the ten councils with the greatest number of staff on the high salaries, six are Tory controlled, according to the report. It shows at least 28,754 local authority staff received more than £50,000 in 2011/12. This cost around £1.9billion – slightly down on the year before due to a large number of redundancy payments in 2010/11. And at least 183 local government officers earned more than the head of MI5’s salary of £155,000. The report shows that the number of council staff on more than £50,000 had increased more than three times as quickly as in the private sector. While 266 local authorities responded to reduced government funding by cutting spending on the £50,000-plus salaries, a total of 118 actually increased the number. MP Brandon Lewis slammed councils who were increasing the number of staff on £50,000 salaries while cutting frontline services . Labour-controlled Birmingham council increased the number of staff earning at this level, at a cost of some £5million extra. This is the highest increase among all councils. Birmingham, the largest local authority in the UK, also has by far the most staff earning above this level – 648. The six Tory-controlled councils in the top ten are Kent (491 staff), Surrey (444), Essex (434), East Sussex (409), Cheshire West and Chester (382) and Hampshire (366). The others are Labour Leicester (459) and Leeds (365), plus a Labour / SNP coalition in Edinburgh (390). The council with the largest drop in the number of staff taking home more than £50,000 was Labour-controlled Manchester, where the figure fell by 410. London had the most staff earning more than £50,000 per head of population, with 9.6 per 10,000 – against just 4.3 in the East Midlands. Matthew Sinclair of the Taxpayers’ Alliance said: 'It is incredible that some councils have even increased spending on high-earning staff this year after a decade in which council tax doubled and when every local authority needs to find savings. 'Councillors need to insist their local authority does more to find savings and cut back on staff costs residents cannot afford.' Local government minister Brandon Lewis, a Conservative, said: ‘For too long the local government pay bill has spiralled up and up and taxpayers have been left footing the bill. ‘While I commend those councils taking action, there are still many others failing to get a grip on costs.’ A spokesman for the Local Government Association said: ‘Middle and senior managers make up around 1 per cent of the total local government workforce, which compares favourably with practices elsewhere in the public and private sectors. ‘Councils provide more than 700 local services. We need good managers to make sure those jobs are done well.’ - Local Government Secretary Eric Pickles last night unveiled new rules for local authorities in which redundancy pay-offs of £100,000 or more can go ahead only after a vote by councillors.","118 councils have increased staff on £50,000 salaries .

"Devastating mistake: The blood used in the transfusion was HIV positive, the hospital said . Saudi Arabia has erupted in outrage over the case of a 12-year-old girl who was reportedly given a transfusion of HIV-positive blood. Reham al-Hakami received the transfusion on February 12 at the main hospital in her village of Jazan. But hours later medical staff visited her home to tell her family that the blood was HIV-positive. The potentially lethal mistake has prompted an unprecedented reaction in the ultraconservative Islamic kingdom with angry calls for the health minister  Abdullah al-Rabiah to resign. Subjects such as HIV and AIDS remain strictly taboo in Saudi Arabia where open criticism of government officials is extremely rare. Reham, who suffers from sickle cell anemia, was airlifted to the King . Faisal Specialist Hospital in Riyadh, the Saudi capital. It is unclear . whether she has tested positive for HIV, CNN reported. The Health Ministry says it is investigating the matter. On Twitter, it said it was 'acting on behalf of the family as the legal guardian in seeking compensation and to ensure that the legal procedures and the decisions made by the legal health councils will be carried out in her case.' The case has prompted a furious backlash across Saudi Arabia, with angry calls for the health minister Abdullah al-Rabiah to resign, CNN reported. Seven ministry officials were sacked and some were fined, including the coordinator of the region's AIDS program, said the statement. Ibrahim al-Hakimi, the family's . lawyer, said the family plans to sue the Health Ministry 'starting from . the most senior official and including all employees involved in this . medical mistake,' CNN reported. By . law, every Saudi citizen who is infected with HIV or has AIDS is . entitled to free medical care, protection of their privacy as to how . they got infected and employment opportunities. But there is still a strong stigma surrounding those living with the disease. While . the government has designated several hospitals to treat those infected . with AIDS or HIV, some hospitals often refuse to care for patients. Because . of strong taboos and the stigma attached to how the virus can be . spread, hospitals and schools are often reluctant to distribute . government information abotu the disease. In . 2008 a new law was enacted, demanding all Saudi couples seeking to . marry to get tested for AIDS-HIV. Previously the rule only applied to . foreigners wishing to marry there.

"Heavy drinking is in sharp decline, according to a large-scale survey. Numbers of people who drink every day of the week have fallen by a third since the 1990s, it was found. The biggest drinkers in the country are the middle-aged and higher-earners, the state-backed survey said. There was a sharp fall in the proportion of people who said they had drunk alcohol on five or more days in the previous week . And despite the apparent prevalence . of teenage binge-drinking, the findings show that drinking is going out . of fashion among the young. The results come from the General . Lifestyle Survey drawn up by the Office for National Statistics from . interviews with 15,000 people. More than half of women under 50 are now unmarried, new figures show. The Office for National Statistics said that over the last 30 years the proportion of women who were married has fallen by a third while the proportion cohabiting has tripled. Since 1979, the proportion of women aged . 18-49 who were married fell from 74per cent to 47 per cent in . 2011. Over the same period the proportion of couples cohabiting trebled from 11 per cent to 34 per cent. One in five women over 45 do not have children. The proportion of one-parent households has also tripled, and the proportion of families with only one child increased by around a third. In 1973 just two per cent of 25-44-year-olds lived alone but by 2011 it had soared to 10 per cent. They suggest that heavy alcohol . consumption is now following smoking as a social and personal habit that . is increasingly uncommon among the young. Instead it is most typically found among those who developed a taste for drink years ago. Declining heavy drinking will further . undermine David Cameron’s scheme to introduce minimum pricing on . alcohol bought in supermarkets. The Prime Minister believes that . blocking sales of cheap alcohol with minimum prices, possible 50 pence a . unit, would tackle alcoholism, violence and anti-social behaviour, and . save the NHS large sums. But the ONS findings back the . majority of the Cabinet who have opposed the pricing plan on the grounds . that it would punish lower income people who drink moderately. Yesterday’s survey says that people in routine jobs and on low incomes drink less alcohol – as do the unemployed. The survey said that in 1998 some 23 per cent of men and 13 per cent of women were drinking on five or more days every week. By 2011, that had dropped to 16 per . cent of men and 9 per cent of women. It added that the people most . likely to drink five days or more a week were those over 45, and that . younger people drink less. There was a major drop in . binge-drinking among men under 24. In 2005, nearly half, 46 per cent, . reported drinking more than four units of alcohol on their heaviest . drinking day in the week before they were interviewed. Just half of 16-24-year-olds reported drinking in a week, down from 60 per cent in 2005 . Four units is the equivalent of two pints of beer, two medium glasses of wine, or four pub measures of spirits. By 2011, fewer than a third of men in that age group – 32 per cent – were drinking at that level. The ONS said there was a similar downward trend in the proportions of women exceeding three units. The survey said highest levels of . regular drinking were among managers and professionals, and lowest . levels among those whose work was described as routine or manual. Similarly, the wealthier the household, the more likely the people in it to drink. Three-quarters of men with jobs drank . alcohol in the week before they were interviewed, but fewer than half . of those who were unemployed or workless had drunk. The calorie count of alcoholic drinks could be displayed in pubs and shops under plans to warn people about how fattening booze can be . It was also found that 67 per cent of . men and 54 per cent of women had a drink in the week before their . interview in England, compared with 56 per cent and 48 per cent in . Scotland. Almost one in ten pregnant women continue to drink during pregnancy, the General Lifestyle Survey found. The survey also noted that the number of people who smoke has gone down from 45 per cent in 1974 to 20 per cent in 2011. Elaine Hindal, of the Drinkaware . pressure group, said: ‘On the surface, today’s figures seem to suggest . we’re all drinking less, but if you take a closer look, there’s still . cause for concern. Of regular drinkers, more than half report drinking . over the guidelines, and a quarter are drinking to binge-drinking . levels.’","Office for National Statistics reveals the 'most pronounced changes' in drinking habits was among 16-24-year-olds .

"Lassy Chiwayo has been recalled to South Africa for 'health reasons' but several South African newspapers have reported he was found wandering naked in the streets . South Africa's consul-general in China has been recalled after he was allegedly found wandering the streets naked. Lassy Chiwayo, a veteran politician who spent time in prison with Nelson Mandela, has had his contract in Shanghai terminated and is back in Pretoria. The South African foreign office says he was recalled due to 'health reasons', but several newspapers have reported that Mr Chiwayo was found wandering naked near his home three months ago. According to Sunday World, his nude walks were a regular occurrence. A source said: 'He would disappear for days without trace and he would be found walking around naked.' Mr Chiwayo was also reported to have assaulted South Africa's ambassador to China Bheki Langa at an official function in Beijing. The 44-year-old has denied he was recalled saying it is 'general practice' for envoys to be reassigned. He dismissed the naked wandering stories and insisted his relationship with Dr Langa was 'healthy and cordial'.'All that you are saying is news to me,' he told the Sunday World. 'I don't have any health challenges that need intervention from the department.' It is the latest in a series of misfortunes to hit Mr Chiwayo, an engaged father-of-three. Last month, a fire gutted his home in Nelspruit in a suspected arson attack which destroyed a Porsche, a quad bike and £22,000-worth of Persian rugs. Mr Chiwayo denied that he was recalled saying his move back to South Africa was 'general practice' During his tenure as major of the Mbombela municipality in Mpumalanga he was hospitalised three times with stress and was constantly at war with the chairman of the African National Congress. His mental fragility was reportedly induced by the assassination of a fellow politician he was shot dead as he was poised to expose a corruption scandal in 2009. Clayson Monyela, a spokesman for the Department of International Relations and Cooperation (DIRCO), confirmed to the Daily Telegraph that Mr Chiwayo had been recalled 'for health reasons'. 'He is receiving assistance from the department,' Mr Monyela said.","Lassy Chiwayo has had his contract in Shanghai terminated .

"Lianne Burns had been living in Marigot on the French side of the tropical island - which has a population of just 75,000 - for 12 years . A drifter who strangled a British tour guide on a paradise Caribbean island then hid her body in a cupboard has been jailed for 20 years. Younes El-Mami wrapped the body of Lianne Burns, originally from Leigh-on-Sea, Essex, in tape and left her head covered by a bag with the smiley face logo on it and the word 'Merci'. Lianne, 43, had moved to French-controlled Saint Martin in 1999 after visiting it on a cruise ship and falling in love with the idyllic island. Late in 2010 she started a relationship with El-Mami, 32, and gave him a home when he arrived on the island with no prospects. But four months into the romance the jealous Italian-Moroccan murdered her after another man complimented her at an awards do in April 2011. Lianne had collected an honour for her company Rendezvous Travel and witnesses saw controlling El-Mami become agitated. He killed her at her home then withdrew money from her account and went out drinking for the night. Lianne's body was found the following day when she failed to turn up for work and El-Mami confessed to her murder. He was jailed for 20 years on March 1 on the neighbouring island of Guadalope but despite a full trial his motivation for the killing remains unclear. Lianne's devoted sisters Kim Spooner, 34, and Lisa Burns, 45, both gave up their jobs and spent £45,000 on legal fees to ensure Lianne was given justice. Kim, a former communications manager, said: 'El-Mami was a drifter. He had just arrived on the island and she offered him a roof over his head. It was her kindness that was her undoing. 'The awards ceremony was a really happy day for Lianne. The next day she was in the local paper accepting the award. 'By that time Lianne was already dead. The witnesses said El-Mami got more and more agitated throughout the evening.' Younes El-Mami has been jailed for twenty years after being found guilty of murder but his motives for the killing remain unclear . Justice: Kim Spooner, left, has campaigned for two years to get justice for her sister Lianne (right) Devastated: Lianne's sister Kim Spooner (left) said the family, including step-dad Ian Spooner, are 'painfully happy' with 20-year sentence for El-Mami . Younes El-Mami (right) wrapped the body of Lianne Burns (left) in tape and covered her head with a bag with the smiley face logo on it and the word 'Merci' 'A 65-year-old man said Lianne looked lovely, as she was all dressed up for the ceremony, and he got angry about that. 'He had about eight to ten interviews with the police and in each one his story changed and he remembered different parts of the evening. 'He said he was playing a game where he pretended to strangle Lianne. But she did not find it funny. 'He said when she tried to walk away he killed her. We do not know what triggered it or why he killed her. He must have had so much pent up aggression to go from zero to murder. 'Not only did he kill her but he used two full rolls of tape to tie her up.' She added: 'The smiley face was Lianne’s symbol. She collected things with it on. Putting the bag on her head is a really macabre thing to do. Lianne worked as a fitness instructor in the UK and on board cruise ships before falling in love with Saint Martin and moving there in 1999. She was very close to her family and visited her mother Vivienne Spooner, 70, father Brian Burns, 73, and sisters in Britain at least once a year. Lianne's identical twin sister Lisa is a former hedge fund office manager who lives in Hong Kong. Kim added that the family were 'painfully happy' with the sentence on El-Mami. She said: 'El-Mami wanted to be financially dependent on women, but he also wanted to dominate them. 'Lianne was a successful career woman - she was never going to be dominated. So many people knew Lianne on the island - her death has had a huge impact. 'Our retribution is his sentence. 20 years feels like a fair sentence. We are painfully happy with it.' St Martin, population 75,000, is subject to the French legal system.

"Amazon has been accused of ‘extortion’ by raising fees by up to 70 per cent for companies that sell through its website. The online retailer is to increase the commission on all electronic goods sold on its ‘marketplace’ section from 7.5 per cent to 12 per cent from Thursday. But small business owners say the move erodes profit margins and could send many to the wall.‘It makes it very difficult to make money,’ said one retailer. ‘Once you tot it all up, you’re not actually making a profit.’ Dominance: The world's biggest internet retailer is imposing punishing fee increases on small traders who sell their goods through the website . About 40 per cent of Amazon’s business comes from its marketplace, where other companies can sell their wares. The US group already charges firms 15 . per cent for homeware items, but traders warned that electronic goods . have razor-thin profit margins. Any business selling more than 35 . items a month now faces fees of £28.75. On rival website eBay, however, . sellers can list up to 50 items a month free and pay a flat 10 per cent . when an item is sold. Amazon’s changes, which affect the UK . and parts of Europe, also raise the commission on vehicle parts by . three per cent to 15 per cent. Some business owners now face the . choice between raising prices or watching their profits vanish . altogether. ‘All Amazon is doing for the money is taking credit card . details from the customer,’ said one businessman. ‘All that’s going to happen on the . marketplace is that sellers will have to put their price up, but then . they will get undercut.’ He said 60 per cent of the . £2.5million revenues from his homeware operation last year came from the . American company – which made it difficult to go elsewhere. But many traders may still abandon Amazon for eBay or Play.com despite the reliance on its online dominance, he added. Another trader said Amazon could see what products prove most popular on the marketplace before selling them itself. ‘They end up competing with their own . customers,’ he added. ‘But nobody wants to be quoted attacking this . because Amazon is a key part of their business. ‘It’s the threat and power of Amazon – they have got the power to clamp down on these sellers.’ Last year the group was dubbed . ‘immoral’ by MPs after it paid just £1.8million in corporation tax in . 2011 despite sales of £3.35billion in the UK. Vendor fees on electronic goods such . as headphones and memory cards will go up from seven per cent to 12 per . cent for the busiest UK-based traders from 4 April, according to a . report in the Guardian. Fees for UK traders using Amazon to sell automotive parts will go up from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. Growing: Traders are the latest group to express concern at the seemingly unstoppable rise of the online giant, which has already been accused of jeopardising the future of the high street book shop . For German sellers offering tyres . through the site, fees will rise from seven per cent to 10 per cent . after the Easter weekend, while seller fees for French traders offering . DVDs, music and video games on Amazon will go up from 10 per cent to 15 . per cent. Small traders in the UK using the site to sell automotive parts will see fees go from 12 per cent to 15 per cent. Traders . have reacted with fury to the hikes, becoming the latest group to rail . against the seemingly unstoppable rise of the online giant, which has . already been accused of placing the future of the high street book shop . in jeopardy. As independent bookshops continue to close at an alarming . rate, Amazon credited e-book sales for Christmas sales of £13.5billion . in 2012. At the end of 2012 . the 'tax scrimping' retailer was branded 'immoral' after it emerged its . UK arm had recorded a pre-tax profit of £74million the previous year - . but paid just £1.8million in tax. Third-party . traders play a significant role in the online business, with two . million globally selling through Amazon. In the pre-Christmas period in . 2012, two in five items bought on Amazon were sold by third-party . traders. Another British trader - who generates in excess of £1million in sales through Amazon - said the increases had prompted him to switch his attention to eBay, which he said offered a less costly means of doing business. The seller said eBay also passed on payments to traders quickly, while Amazon holds on to payments for two to three weeks. 'It's a huge strain on a small . business not being able to access cash we're owed from Amazon. And . they're making an absolute fortune in interest.' The traders who spoke out against Amazon did so on condition of anonymity amid concern over how the retailer would respond. Similar increases came into effect in the U.S. in January. Amazon could not be reached for comment. In less than 20 years Amazon has gone from an online bookstore run from founder Jeff Bezos's garage, to the world's biggest online retailer. One of the first big firms to start selling goods over the internet, Amazon rapidly diversified adding DVDs, CDs and video games to its online offering, along with clothes, furniture and toys. Today the Seattle-based firm generates billions in profits and has separate websites in the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Brazil, Japan and China. The popularity of ebooks is key to the success of the online giant, and Amazon reported record revenues at the start of the year in a clear indication of the continued mass migration of shoppers from the high street to the web. It racked up sales of £13.5bn in the fourth quarter of 2012, up from £10bn in the same period of the previous year. Kindle e-book sales -up a whopping 70 per cent - were credited for the surge in profits. Overall sales were up by 22 per cent, driven by the popularity of Amazon's Kindle Fire tablet.","Small traders selling DVDs and tyres through Amazon among those affected .

"Unsavoury character: New academic research has suggested William Shakespeare exploited the poor and dodged tax . It sounds like the sort of character who would have been deeply unpopular in one of his plays. William Shakespeare was a 'ruthless businessman' and tax dodger, researchers have claimed. Although he wrote plays that championed the rights of the poor and the needy, archived documents show the playwright was actually a wealthy landowner repeatedly dragged before the courts and fined for illegally stockpiling food and threatened with jail for evading taxes. He 'stored grain, malt and barley for resale at inflated prices to neighbours and local tradesmen' at a time when Europe was suffering famines, the academics said, and channelled the profits into land purchases. They added that Shakespeare did all he could to 'avoid taxes, maximise profits at others' expense and exploit the vulnerable – while writing plays about their plight'. And his approach of 'combining both illegal and legal activities' meant he could retire after a working life of only 24 years. Researchers at Aberystwyth University carried out an academic study looking into Shakespeare's 'other life' as one of Warwickshire's biggest landowners and have uncovered the less than savoury side to Britain's greatest playwright. The allegation he exploited famine has also led to suggestions that his Coriolanus, for years regarded as a plea for the starving poor, was in fact his way of trying to expunge a guilty conscience. Jayne Archer, a researcher in Renaissance literature at Aberystwyth University, said in the Sunday Times: 'There was another side to Shakespeare besides the brilliant playwright — as a ruthless businessman who did all he could to avoid taxes, maximise profits at others' expense and exploit the vulnerable — while also writing plays about their plight to entertain them. Britain's greatest playwright: Actors Amanda Hale and Pete Postlethwaite in Shakiespeare's King Lear, which depicted an ageing monarch trying to divide his lands, and the food they produce, between his daughters . 'Shakespeare is remembered as a . playwright, but there was no copyright then and no sense that his plays . could generate future income. 'That drove him to dodge taxes, illegally hoard [food] and act as a money-lender. 'He . had two surviving daughters and would have seen himself as providing . for them, but he was acting illegally and undermining the government's . attempts to feed people.' Coriolanus . depicts a famine created and exploited by rich merchants and . politicians to maximise the price of food and includes the lines: 'They . ne'er cared for us yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses . crammed with grain.' It has now emerged that as Shakespeare wrote the play at the height of the 1607 food riots, he was himself hoarding grain. Wealthy: The playwright was one of Warwickshire's biggest landowners . As . one of the biggest landowners in Warwickshire, he was ideally placed to . push prices up and then sell at the top of the market. Ms . Archer worked with Richard Marggraf Turley, a professor in the . department, and Howard Thomas, a professor of plant science, to study . Shakespeare's life as a businessman and owner of arable farmland and . pasture at a time when Europe was suffering famines. They . found documents in the court and tax archives showing he was repeatedly . dragged before the courts and fined for illegally stockpiling food and . was threatened with jail for evading tax payments. In . a paper, the academics wrote: 'Over a 15-year period Shakespeare . purchased and stored grain, malt and barley for resale at inflated . prices to neighbours and local tradesmen. 'In . February 1598 he was prosecuted for holding 80 bushels of malt or corn . during a time of shortage. He pursued those who could not pay him in . full for these staples and used the profits to further his own . money-lending activities ... 'Profits . were channelled into land purchases. He also acquired tithes on local . produce, including ""corn, grain and hay"", allowing him to cream off the . profits from others' manual work. 'By combining both illegal and legal activities, Shakespeare was able to retire in 1613 as the largest property owner in his home town, Stratford-upon-Avon. His profits — minus a few fines for illegal hoarding and tax evasion — meant he had a working life of just 24 years.' Shakespeare's experience as a rich landowner at a time of famine may be reflected in plays such as King Lear, which depicts an ageing monarch trying to divide his lands, and the food they produce, between his daughters. Professor Jonathan Bate, the Shakespeare scholar and provost of Worcester College, Oxford, said Archer and her colleagues had performed a valuable service in setting Shakespeare's work in the context of the famines and food shortages of the period.","Shakespeare's Coriolanus may have been reflection of guilty conscience .

"Silicon Valley kingmaker and TechCrunch blog founder Michael Arrington is facing allegations of rape and physical abuse after an ex-girlfriend came forward with public accusations on Facebook. Jenn Allen, who is herself a tech entrepreneur, wrote accusations last month that Arrington had physically and emotionally abused her during their eight year relationship and threatened to kill her if she told anyone. In a subsequent post on a news site, she claimed that Arrington had also sexually assaulted a friend. After Ms Allen's accusations became public, news sites reported another allegation against Arrington - that he threw an ex-girlfriend against her bed in 1999. Arrington, who has been named one of the . most powerful people in the Internet, has not responded to the . allegations and he could not be reached for comment by MailOnline. Soured: Jenn Allen says she dated Michael Arrington, deemed one of the most influential men in Silicon Valley, for eight years. She is accusing him of rape and physical abuse . Accusations: This is the post that started the allegations against Arrington. Three more abuse allegations have surfaced since then . The claims were never reported to police. Friends and witnesses have come forward with contradicting stories . about the incidents in question. One of the alleged victims also appears . to deny that Arrington abused her. Other ex-girlfriends have come forward to report that Arrington never abused them, reports TechCrunch, the blog Arrington founded in 2005. Arrington sold TechCruch to AOL in 2011 for $25million and is no longer is charge of editorial content. The controversy began on March 29 when Ms Allen posted to her 4,700 followers: 'I loved Michael Arrington for 8+ years starting when i implemented Eurekster search at the time on Techcrunch in 2006 and throughout the years.

Cecile DeSmet Sharp told Gawker she handled a complaint from an employee who said Arrington has attacked her in her hotel room in 1999 while the two were traveling for a conference. 'I believe he threw her onto the bed. And she started kicking and he held her down really hard,' Ms Sharp said. Ms Sharp said the incident was 'swept under the rug' by the company because Arrington was friends and business partners with the CEO. 'I was essentially told to look the other way,' Ms Sharp said. However, Keith Teire, who ran RealNames until it went under, told TechCrunch that he ordered a full investigation of the incident by an outside firm. 'As is normal in these circumstances an outside party was hired to conduct an investigation. This was extensive and I was never directly involved in it as I was not a witness to any events. The investigation concluded that there was no behavior to answer for. Mike was never reprimanded in any way,' he said.

"NBC will reportedly pay Jay Leno $15 million as he steps down as host of The Tonight Show months ahead of the end of his contract. The payout is part of Leno's deal to leave the show - which he has hosted for 22 years - before his contract expires in September 2014, making way for Jimmy Fallon as the new host. But a source told the New York Daily News that the payoff - which equates to Leno's annual salary on the show - is peanuts for the comedian, who makes the biggest bucks for standup in Las Vegas. As the shake-up was confirmed after weeks of speculation, Leno told Fallon he was 'counting on' him to keep network ratings high. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Smooth transition: NBC executives hoped for the best possible timing of the move, picking after the Winter Olympics which give them their largest audience to hype Fallon . Heading out: Leno will receive a $15 million payoff to leave the show before his contract is up . In his opening monologue of Wednesday's . show Leno said: ‘I just have one request of Jimmy. We've all fought, . kicked and scratched to get this network up to fifth place, okay? 'Now we have to keep it there. Jimmy don't let it slip into sixth. We're counting on you.’ The replacement move, which had been . anticipated for weeks, was announced yesterday and will officially take place following the . network's broadcast of the Winter Olympics. Fallon . will more than double his multi-million dollar salary when he takes over . from outgoing host Jay Leno next year on the top-rated NBC show. Industry insiders predict that Fallon . will see the $5million he gets for fronting 'The Late Show' boosted to . $12 million when he goes head-to-head with CBS' David Letterman and . ABC's Jimmy Kimmel in February. Although Fallon's pay packet will be three million less than the $15million Leno takes home, it still represents a massive show of faith in Fallon, who . has been working late night television for less than five years. Bitter? Jay Leno kept up the assault on NBC execs in his show last night after numerous monologues making fun of bosses . The . 62-year-old Leno - who was temporarily removed from the show in 2009 in . favor of Conan O'Brien - had made repeated jokes about his bosses and . the network in recent weeks while rumors swirled over the latest move. But . he and Fallon, 38, presented a united front while announcing the news. They recently made a parody video set to a tune from West Side Story . that lampooned their situation. 'The main difference between this and . the other time is I’m part of the process. The last time the decision . was made without me. I came into work one day and — you’re out,' Leno . said, comparing his previous ouster and now. 'This time around there really aren’t any complications like there were the last time,' he added, according to the New York Times. 'This time it feels right.' Leno also said in a press release: . 'Congratulations Jimmy. I hope you're as lucky as me and hold on to the . job until you're the old guy. If you need me, I'll be at the garage.' Laughing his way to the bank: Leno has been on an anti-NBC joke offensive since reports emerged saying Fallon, pictured, would be replacing him at Tonight . Fallon, whose Late Night show began at 12:35am, added: 'I’m really excited to host a show that starts today instead of tomorrow.' 'I have nothing but respect for Jay,' Fallon said. 'If it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have a show to be taking over.' The show will be relocated from Los Angeles to New York, where the program started in 1954 when Steve Allen was its host. Leno - aside from the brief interruption when O'Brien hosted the program - has been the show's presenter since 1992. He has routinely been tops in the ratings, even as NBC's primetime and daytime programming has fallen off. In . competition? Jay Leno and Jimmy Fallon have been the mainstay of NBC's . late night schedule for the past three years with reports now saying . Fallon will take over Tonight . 'I’m glad I've kept it No. 1,' Leno . said. 'When I started people said, ""Oh the only reason you’re winning is . because of ‘ER,"" or ""The only reason you’re winning is because Hugh . Grant came on and said that one thing."" Well, at least now I can say the . only reason we’re winning is cause we’re winning.' After leaving, he said he expects to be 'back on the road, being a comedian again.' 'Saturday Night Live' producer Lorne . Michaels, who also produces 'Late Night', will take over as producer of . the new 'Tonight Show.' Fallon's replacement at 12:35 am was not named, although Seth Meyers of SNL is considered a strong candidate. NBC . is worried that ABC's Jimmy Kimmel, whose show recently started at the . 11:35 p.m. time slot,  will establish himself as a go-to late night . performer for a younger generation if the network didn't move swiftly to . install Fallon. Next generation?: With Fallon's ascension to the top chair, Seth Myers, right, is considered the favorite to take over the 12:35 a.m. show . Conan O'Brien briefly replaced Leno as host of The Tonight Show in 2009 until NBC executives reversed their decision. He now hosts a show on TBS . Kimmel took to Twitter to jokingly offer his congratulations to his new counterpart. 'Congratulations to my dear, sweet @jimmyfallon - a formidable rival and an incredible lover.' But . the move also has the potential to backfire with Leno's fans, who did . not embrace Conan O'Brien when Leno was temporarily moved to prime time a . few years ago. O'Brien held . onto the job for just eight months before being replaced by his . predecessor. O'Brien now hosts a show on cable network TBS. Leno, whose contract expires next year, hasn't always sounded so gracious over Fallon taking over. He has recently used comedy as a weapon against his network . bosses - branding a recent ratings boost a 'miracle' and saying that NBC . is a 'big number two' in his show. Hit with youth: Jimmy Fallon has proved remarkably popular and executives believe his age and appeal to younger viewers will keep Tonight on top for years to come . 'You know what that means? Between . Easter and Passover, this is truly the season of miracles. We’re number . two! I’ve been saying for the last week that NBC is a big number two. Haven’t I been saying that? Congratulations!' Leno went on to talk about a report that T-Mobile is reducing its contracts, adding: 'Apparently they got the idea from NBC.' The routine comes hot on the heels of other cutting remarks against executives at the network. Leno had also joked about a 'make-nice' meeting he had with bosses the night before. He said to make amends they had . offered to send him and his wife on a Carnival cruise - the crippled . liner that caused passengers to endure five nightmarish days in the Gulf . of Mexico. In another wisecrack, Leno cited news . reports of a Canadian man who had a knife pulled from his back after . three years, he sniped: 'He must have worked at NBC, too.' Rising star: Jimmy Fallon is photographed with SNL creator/producer Lorne Michaels. Fallon will be Leno's replacement on Tonight, which will be executive produced by Michaels . In another routine he referred to his bosses as 'snakes.' 'You know the whole . legend of St. Patrick right? St. Patrick drove all the snakes out of Ireland . – and then they came to the United States and became NBC executives.' The rapid ascent of Fallon and his . certain promotion is seen by analysts as NBC recognizing the competition . offered by ABC's popular Jimmy Kimmel. While Leno's 'Tonight' show still tops . the ratings, Kimmel moved his show to the earlier time-slot of 11.35pm to directly compete with him and CBS' David Letterman. The Times report quoted one senior executive as saying, 'There is no way on earth that this is not going to happen' - a certainty which may explain why Leno isn't holding back the abuse. 'According to several reports, . scientists say they are getting closer and closer to being able to do . Jurassic Park-style cloning of extinct species,' Leno, he told his . audience one night. 'Imagine that. Things that were once . thought to be extinct could be brought back from the dead. So there’s . hope for NBC. It could turn around.'","The transition will take place following next year's Winter Olympics .

"British businesses want the government to seize back powers from Brussels to stop them being swamped in red tape, a new poll reveals today. The findings come in the first major survey of firms to be conducted after David Cameron’s speech on Europe in January, when the Prime Minister said he wants to renegotiate Britain’s relationship with the European Union and promised an in-or-out referendum by the end of 2017, if the Conservatives are still in power. The survey of  more than 4,000 firms by the British Chambers of Commerce (BCC) shows support among 64pc of businesses for remaining in Europe – but only if the UK government can wrest back from the eurocrats the power to set the rules here on employment law and health and safety. Restricted: UK businesses want Cameron to scrap EU laws on employment law and health and safety . ‘From the point of view of red tape, Brussels is a beast that has gone completely out of control,’ said John Longworth, director general of the BCC. ‘In the food and agriculture sectors, 90percent of new legislation here comes out of Europe. The British government has introduced a ‘one-in-one-out’ rule so that when  a new regulation comes in, an old one must go, but they are powerless about the legislation coming from the EU.’ According to the survey, a mere 15pc of firms feel ‘positive’ about keeping the UK’s relationship with Europe unchanged, while more than four out of ten believe sticking with the status quo will harm their company and the UK economy. Almost 20 percent want Britain to withdraw totally from the EU, believing the disadvantages of all the rules and regulations imposed by Brussels outweigh the benefits of a single market. A third would like to see Britain pull out but then draw up a new trade agreement with the EU. ‘British business want to stay in Europe, but they want a different relationship with Brussels,’ Longworth said. ‘We are at a disadvantage as things stand because the EU internal market was designed to benefit Germany and it is mainly for manufactured goods, not services, which make up 70pc of our economy.’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Prime Minister David Cameron, who has promised a referendum on Europe if his party are in power in 2017 . He added that the UK could suffer disproportionately from the new EU Financial Transactions Tax championed by Berlin and Paris, because of the strength of our financial services sector. ‘We need to iron out these structural disadvantages for the UK,’ he said. ‘Cameron is in a stronger position to renegotiate than many think because the UK is Germany’s largest export market, so when he sits down with the German chancellor Angela Merkel, he is in a good bargaining position.’ Firms complain they are drowning under a flood of EU-inspired red tape on employment, health and safety and the environment, saying it is imposing high costs and holding back their plans to grow. High profile examples include the Working Time Directive that limits the number of hours an employee can work. ‘This does not just affect small firms, it affects medium and even large ones,’ Longworth said. ‘Multinationals have whole departments devoted to dealing with it, at very significant cost.’ ‘Our poll is based on a very large number of businesses of all sizes, in all sectors, from around the country and it is very clear. The strongest finding is that businesses support the PM’s position of renegotiating our relationship. It is becoming more and more apparent that the status quo is not an option.’","Poll reveals firms want constricting laws to be abandoned .

"The neighbor credited with saving three young women held captive in a Cleveland home for a decade has become an instant celebrity due to the animated and zany interviews he gave to news outlets in the wake of the rescue. Charles Ramsey said he was eating a McDonald's meal when he heard screams coming from the residence, he ran over to investigate, holding a Big Mac, and then came face-to-face with Amanda Berry, who was last seen in 2003 aged 14. His lively and captivating interviews have been shared on social networking sites, as has his expletive-ridden 911 call, in which he can be heard asking Amanda Berry, 'Do you need an ambulance or some sh**?'

It was this and other memorable statements that has made Ramsey an internet celebrity. There is already an 'autotune remix' of his interview, called Little Pretty White Girl. Memes and gifs have also started to emerge with the phrases, 'I barbeque with this dude, we eat ribs and whatnot' and 'You got some big testicles to pull this off bro.'

Mr Ramsey said: 'When she told me, it didn’t register until I got the call to 911 and I'm like, ""I'm calling 911 for Amanda Berry? I thought this girl was dead.""' He handed Amanda the phone, and she told police that she had been held captive in the home and to send help. Also found in the home were two more women who had been reported missing  at around the same time - Gina DeJesus and Michelle Knight. All three appeared to be in good health. Dr Gerald Maloney, of Cleveland MetroHealth Center, told reporters: 'They're safe... We're in the process of evaluating medical needs. They appear to be in fair condition at the moment.'

"In two years Chancellor George Osborne will be taking £1billion a year in tax from lottery tickets, it has been forecast . The biggest winner from the imminent revamp of the National Lottery will be the Treasury, independent analysts said yesterday. They forecast that two years from now, Chancellor George Osborne will be taking £1billion a year in tax from lottery tickets – almost double the State’s share of the takings before the onset of the economic downturn. The estimate means the Treasury is due to double its money following the doubling of the price of a Lotto ticket to £2 this autumn. Analysts GBGC said the record take for the Government reflects the efficiency of Camelot’s stewardship of the lottery and the affordability of Lotto and Euromillions tickets and scratch cards. But critics say ministers are increasing a stealth tax on those who have a flutter in the belief that they are helping good causes. The new estimates come in advance of the first increase in the price of tickets for the main Lotto game since it was launched nearly 20 years ago. The relaunch is designed to bring regular £5million weekend jackpots, but a family accustomed to a £5 weekly gamble will find themselves paying £10 for the same chance of winning. Duty paid on National Lottery tickets runs at 12 per cent, and from the game’s beginnings in 1994 until 2007 the amount paid to the Treasury each year ran at between £500million and £600million. But the Government’s take has been rising steeply in line with tickets since the onset of the downturn, the figures show. It topped £800million last year and will hit £1billion in two years’ time, they indicated. The estimate means the Treasury is due to double its money following the doubling of the price of a Lotto ticket to £2 this autumn . For every £1 spent on the lottery, 50p is paid to winners, 28p goes to good causes, 5p to retailers, 5p to the operator – and 12p to the Treasury. The report from GBGC, Global Betting and Gaming Consultants, said: ‘The last few years have each seen record-breaking amounts of duty generated by the National Lottery’s performance. The forthcoming ticket and prize increases will spur further sales increases and, therefore, increase the amount the Government receives in duty.’ But economist Ruth Lea of the Arbuthnot Banking Group said: ‘The lottery was always sold on the basis that …players were first and foremost supporting good causes. ‘People might be unpleasantly surprised at how much they are paying to HM Government.’","Treasury to double its money when the price of a Lotto ticket doubles to £2 .

"A top State Department appointee told Libya's ambassador to the United States one day after the military-style assault on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi that the . terror group Ansar al-Shariah was responsible. But four days later, the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations said on television that it was the product of a spontaneous protest. During a fiery and emotional congressional hearing on the 2012 attack on the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Rep. Trey Gowdy read aloud from an email dated Sept. 12, 2012 to senior State Department officers, from Elizabeth Jones, the acting Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs. Describing a conversation she had with then-Libyan ambassador Ali Aujali, Jones wrote in the previously undisclosed email that 'I told him that the group that conducted the attacks, Ansar al-Sharia, is affiliated with Islamic terrorists.' 'Let me say that again,' Gowdy emphasized during the hearing: 'She told him.' Aujali was Libya's ambassador in Washington, D.C. until November 2012. He was later proposed as a candidate to be the country's foreign minister, but he was never sworn in. News reports at the time attributed his failure to win the job to his history of involvement with the regime of the dictator Muammar Gaddafi. Acting U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Jones told Libya's president one day after the Benghazi attack that Islamic terrorists had killed the U.S. Ambassador and reduced the compound to a burnt-out shell . The State Department's former deputy chief of mission in Libya, Gregory Hicks, testified that 'I was stunned' after UN Ambassador Susan Rice ignored intelligence about terrorist attackers during her television interviews on Set, 16, 2012. 'My jaw dropped. And I was embarrassed.' President Obama appointed Jones to her post on June 1, 2012, following her service as U.S. Ambassador to Kazakhstan during the 1990s, and as assistant secretary for Europe and Eurasia. Her email, Gowdy said, went to 'almost everyone in the State Department,' including spokeswoman Victoria Nuland. Nuland, according to a report in The Weekly Standard, was instrumental in raising red flags about the CIA's candid assessment of how and why the consulate was attacked, which the agency prepared as talking points for members of Congress. And according to a report from House Republicans released in April, Nuland wrote in an email that 'my building leadership' at the State Department wasn't happy with those talking points. In the ensuing 24 hours, the talking points were edited heavily, reportedly by White House deputies, and all references to Islamic terrorism were removed. South Carolina Republican Rep. Trey Gowdy, shown here in a House Oversight committee hearing in 2012, read Jones' email to State Department leaders, in which she recounted her discussion with Libyan president Mohammed al-Magarief . Gowdy's statement came in a hearing before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. In the days following the attack, various Obama administration officials said publicly that a spontaneous protest, not a terror attack, destroyed the consulate and killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. UN Ambassador Susan Rice, in particular, appeared on five Sunday morning political talk shows and repeated that talking point. Greg Hicks, formerly the U.S. State Department's Deputy Chief of Mission in Libya, testified Rice never spoke with him before appearing on those television programs. 'She did not bother to have a conversation with you before she went on national television?' Gowdy asked Hicks. 'No sir,' he replied. UN Ambassador Susan Rice said on Sept. 16 - four days after Jones told Libya's president that Ansar al-Sharia had attacked the Benghazi consulate - that a spontaneous protest was behind the military-style assault . Three Benghazi whistle-blowers testified on Wednesday, including Hicks (c), Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Counterterrorism Mark Thompson (L), and State Department diplomatic security officer Eric Nordstrom . Libyan president, Mohammed el-Megarif learned on Sept. 12 from acting Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Elizabeth Jones that Ansar al-Sharia had attacked the Benghazi consulate . Asked for his reaction when he heard Rice contradict the best intelligence from the CIA and the email from Jones, Hicks said, 'I was stunned. My jaw dropped. And I was embarrassed.' Asked later in the hearing by Ohio Republican Rep. Jim Jordan about a phone call he had with Jones after Rice's television interviews, Hicks said he asked why Rice said what she did. ""'She said ""I don't know."" ... The sense I got was that I should stop that line of questioning.' Hicks also testified that it took 'maybe 18 days to get the FBI team to Benghazi' for an investigation to commence. 'The crime scene was unsecured for 18 days?' Gowdy asked, his voice rising? 'Yes,' came Hicks' reply. The US consulate compound in Benghazi was reduced to a burnt-out shell after armed terrorists attacked. Hillary Clinton and others in the Obama administration are under fire for failing to prevent the attack, and for covering up its causes . House Oversight Committee Chairman Darrell Issa (L) invited Hicks to testify. Hicks was the second-ranking diplomatic officer in Libya behind Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who perished in the Benghazi attack .","Sept. 11: Terrorists attack the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi, Libya .

"Boris Johnson has dismissed David Cameron as a ‘girly swot’ because he got a first class degree. The London Mayor, who got a 2:1 degree in classics from Balliol College Oxford, lashed out after he was teased about the Prime Minister’s greater academic accomplishment. Quizzed about Mr Cameron and his brother Jo Johnson - now head of Mr Cameron’s policy board - both of whom got firsts in Philosophy, Politics and Economics, the Mayor pointed out that he won a scholarship and they did not. Teasing: David Cameron, left, was a 'girly swot' at university says Mayor of London Boris Johnson, right . In an interview with the London Evening Standard, he then branded his rivals: ‘Girly swots who wasted their time at university.’ Mr Johnson and Mr Cameron have been rivals since they were at Eton College together and members of the exclusive Bullingdon Club dining society at Oxford. The Mayor made the comments as he unveiled a document on the future of the capital. The 11,000 word paper calling for more transport and house building was entitled ‘Ambitions for London’ but was quickly dubbed ‘Ambitions for Boris’ in Westminster, where MPs viewed it as an exercise in promoting the Mayor. At a press conference to mark the publication, Mr Johnson joked about the widespread belief that he wants to be Prime Minister when his mayoral term is up in 2016. He called for the building of Crossrail 2, linking North and South London, a project that will take years. Students: Both David Cameron and Boris Johnson went to Eton College and Oxford University (pictured) ‘I’m not going to be there to cut the ribbon for Crossrail 2,’ he said. ‘At least not as Mayor ... or indeed as anything else.’ The Mayor provocatively admitted that he has enjoyed a pint and ‘a very amusing time’ with UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage. Mr Johnson then launched a bizarre defence of MPs who have been caught in recent lobbying scandals. Drinking pals: Mr Johnson admitted to enjoying a pint with UKIP leader Nigel Farage, pictured . Conservative MP Patrick Mercer resigned from the Tory Party after he took £4,000 from undercover reporters to ask Parliamentary questions. And Tim Yeo, chairman of the Energy and Climate Change Select Committee quit his post after he admitted, in another media sting, that he had coached a green company he was paid to advise how to answer questions to his committee. But Mr Johnson leapt to their defence. He said: ‘What I feel ... this is going to get me into trouble, but I do feel a certain amount of sympathy with all these poor MPs who end up thinking they are having some jovial lunch in which they are hysterically exaggerating their ability to do things. ‘As if an MP would tell you whether he is actually any use or knows anyone or if there is any point in his existence, honestly.’ Mr Johnson may have taken the view that his leadership ambitions would be boosted by sympathising with embattled MPs who have been thrown to the wolves by Mr Cameron. The Mayor also alluded to a recent court ruling that lifted reporting restrictions about the fact that he fathered a love child. His document warns of a future ‘population explosion’ in the capital. In his press conference, Boris said the population of London has risen by at least 380,000 since he became Mayor ‘no thanks to me’.","The Mayor lashed out when he was teased over the PM's better degree .

"A couple accused of trying to extort money from missing Madeleine McCann's parents have been arrested at a hideaway in Portugal. Italian Danilo Chemello and his Portuguese girlfriend Aurora Pereira Vaz hit the headlines in 2007 after being seized in southern Spain over the alleged bid to get their hands on a £2.5 million reward offered for information on Madeleine's whereabouts. The case never came to trial despite lurid reports about their past and the discovery of newspaper cuttings about Madeleine in their luxury home in Sotogrande, southern Spain. Arrested: Italian Danilo Chemello is led away by Portuguese police from a rented house in the coastal resort of Estoril near Lisbon where they had been living under false identities . The couple managed to relocate to the Algarve despite Mr Chemello being wanted by authorities in France. They . were arrested at a rented house in the coastal resort of Estoril near . Lisbon on Wednesday - where they had been living since January under . false identities with two teenage children. Portuguese police said they acted on three European arrest warrants. Millionaire ex-construction tycoon . Chemello, 67, is set to be extradited to France shortly after being . remanded in jail following a court appearance in Cascais near Estoril, . while Ms Vaz, 60, is expected to be kept in Portugal. A . French court sentenced them to 18 months in jail for making a false . birth register around the time they are believed to have set up home on . the Algarve. Led away: Portuguese police also arrested Chemello's Portuguese girlfriend Aurora Pereira Vaz from the resort this week . The pair failed to turn up in court and an arrest warrant was issued. Mr . Chemello, convicted and caged along with Ms Vaz for 10 months for child . abuse in a separate case for feeding his stepdaughter dog food and . locking her in a bedroom with her hands and legs tied with tape, is also . wanted for trying to blackmail the French judge who jailed them. He . was reportedly sentenced to three years in prison in his absence after . hiring a private detective to probe the woman's judge's private life and . then using the information to blackmail her. Ms Vaz and Mr Chemello tried to to get their hands on a £2.5 million reward offered by Kate and Gerry McCann for information on Madeleine's whereabouts . Italian authorities accused the . couple of kneecapping Vaz's husband Alberto Tana during a bitter custody . battle over her daughter in Rome in 1996. Lost child: Madeleine McCann disappeared during a family holiday in Portugal in 2007 . Although . cleared of ordering the shooting, both were given 16-month jail . sentences for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice and firearms . offences. The teenage children living with Vaz and Chemello in Portugal are understood to be her two children. They have been taken to a children's home in Portugal. One . neighbour at their home in Estoril, home to Europe's largest casino, . told a local paper he had never seen them playing in the street and said . he thought they weren't even going to school. Specialist . anti-kidnap police stormed the couple's house in Sotogrande in June . 2007 to arrest them over their alleged bid to extort money from . Madeleine McCann's parents. At the time they were said to have tried to claim a £2.5 million reward through a Malaga-based lawyer. Chemello and Vaz appeared in a closed . court hearing before he was transferred to Spain's National Criminal . Court for an extradition hearing on an unrelated matter and she was . released on bail. It is not . yet clear whether the case against them has been dropped or was still . being investigated by a court in San Roque near Cadiz – and it may be . that it has simply been put on hold while the other cases against them . are dealt with. The arrests . came on the eve of an announcement by Scotland Yard it has opened a . formal investigation into Madeleine McCann's disappearance. British . police have formally asked the Crown Prosecution Service to submit an . international letter of request to Portuguese authorities for assistance . in obtaining evidence relating to their inquiries. The Metropolitan Police has asked for a small number of its officers to be present in Portugal for the inquiries there. It . has also said it still believes there is a chance Madeleine is alive . and it is investigating 38 ""persons of interest"" from five European . countries, including 12 British nationals. A . spokesman for the office of Portugal's Attorney General, which archived . the Madeleine McCann investigation in July 2008, said today: 'No . request for mutual judicial assistance from the UK has yet been . received.' Arrested: Italian Danilo Chemello, 67, and his Portuguese girlfriend Aurora Pereira Vaz, 60, pictured in their younger years, have been arrested in Portugal over accusations they tried to extort millions from Madeleine McCann's parents . Pedro do Carmo, head of Portugal's Policia Judiciaria, added: 'Investigations in Portugal are carried out by the Department of Public Prosecution and the Portuguese police. 'But requests from foreign authorities to be present arrive fairly frequently.' Portugal's Ministry of Justice is expected to be tasked with authorising the request when it arrives. The three European arrest warrants they executed were issued by France and Italy for a man aged 67 and a woman aged 60, a spokesman for Portugal's PSP police, which arrested Chemello and Vaz, said. He said they were not aware of any European arrest warrant issued against the couple by Spain - where they were arrested in 2007 over the alleged Madeleine McCann extortion attempt.","Danilo Chemello and girlfriend Aurora Peperia Vaz arrested in Portugal .

"A woman was photographed dragging away her blood spattered Staffordshire bull terrier - just moments after it beheaded a tiny family pet in a horrific attack. The woman - whose arms were also smeared with blood - pulled off her animal and fled down a street in Warrington, Cheshire, after it ripped off the head of a Pomeranian dog. As the Pomeranian's owner Gemma Antell, 30, looked on in horror, the bull terrier's mistress was alleged to have defiantly said: ‘It's not his fault - he's only a baby’, before strolling off with friends. Shocking scene: This woman was photographed dragging away her blood spattered Staffordshire bull terrier - just moments after it beheaded a tiny family pet in a horrific attack in Warrington, Cheshire . But a picture of the woman - showing blood over her left arm and on the dog’s paws - was taken by a passer-by and handed to mother-of-three Miss Antell, who posted it on Twitter and Facebook. Cheshire Police today confirmed the bull terrier had been traced and confiscated - and said that inquiries were under way into whether the animal falls into the category of a banned breed. The incident at 4:30pm on Saturday happened after Miss Antell had taken her dog Elvis to her mother in law’s home. She claimed the larger dog got into the front garden and attacked Elvis. Two young children were said to be present at the time. In a message on Facebook which was posted before the bull terrier was found, Miss Antell said: ‘Right, local people. I need your help.

"Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden has dangerous information that could become the U.S. government's ‘worst nightmare’ if revealed, claims the journalist who first published documents leaked by the former NSA computer analyst. In an interview with Argentinian newspaper La Nacion, Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald said the U.S. government should be careful in its pursuit of Snowden. ‘Snowden has enough information to cause harm to the U.S. government in a single minute than any other person has ever had,’ Greenwald told the paper. Scroll down for video... During Friday's meeting Edward Snowden told human rights activists he plans to stay in Russia temporarily, but officials say they haven't received any request . ‘The U.S. government should be on its knees every day begging that nothing happen to Snowden, because if something does happen to him, all the information will be revealed and it could be its worst nightmare.’ Greenwald claims Snowden has documents containing details about U.S. spy programs that capture transmissions in Latin America and how they work. ‘One way of intercepting communications is through a telephone company in the United States that has contracts with telecommunications companies in most Latin American countries,’ Greenwald said. Last Sunday Brazilian newspaper Globo published Snowden-sourced allegations that the NSA has been monitoring the telephone and e-mail activity of companies and individuals in Brazil for at least ten years. Guardian journalist Glenn Greenwald has said the U.S. government should be careful in its pursuit of Snowden . Brazil's foreign minister Antonio Patriota, says the United States has been spying on Brazil's citizens' electronic communications for at least a decade . After the story emerged, Brazilian foreign minister Antonio Patriota said he going to demand an explanation from the U.S. over the allegations. On Friday, Snowden met with human . rights activists and said he would seek Russian asylum, at least . as a temporary measure before going to Venezuela, Bolivia or Nicaragua, . all of which have offered him asylum. Snowden arrived at . Moscow's Sheremetyevo international airport on June 23 from Hong Kong, . apparently intending to board a flight to Cuba. But he did not get on . that flight and is believed to have spent the last three weeks marooned . in the airport's transit zone. But on Saturday Russian immigration officials said they have not received an . application from him. Former intelligence agency contractor Edward Snowden speaks to human rights representatives in Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport on Friday . The Interfax news . agency quoted Russian migration service head Konstantin Romodanovsky as . saying no asylum request had been received as of Saturday. The state . news agency RIA Novosti cited migration service spokeswoman, Zalina . Kornilova, as also saying no request had been received. Snowden . had made a previous bid for Russian asylum, but President Vladimir Putin . said he would have to agree to stop further leaks of information about . American intelligence service activities before it would be considered. Snowden withdrew the bid, but participants in Friday's meeting said he . was now ready to agree to stop leaks. President Obama and Vladamir Putin discussed Snowden during a telephone conversation on Friday . Granting asylum to Snowden would add significant new stress to already-troubled Washington-Moscow relations. Putin . and President Barack Obama are expected to hold a summit in Moscow in . early September, right before both take part in the Group of 20 summit . in St. Petersburg, and the Snowden issue could overshadow both . gatherings. Obama and Putin discussed Snowden, among other . issues, during a telephone call on Friday, the White House said in a . terse statement that provided no specifics of their conversation about . the NSA leaker. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the call was . planned several days ago, suggesting that it was unrelated to Snowden's . meeting with the activists. Russia so far has sidestepped the . issue by claiming that it cannot take action on Snowden because his . presence in the transit zone puts him technically outside Russian . territory. But by agreeing to the condition that he stop leaks, Snowden . could force Russia's hand. Media frenzy: Russian lawyer Genri Reznik (C) speaks to journalists after arriving at Sheremetyevo airport in Moscow on Friday for a meeting with NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden . Friday's meeting in the airport's . transit zone included representatives of Amnesty International and Human . Rights Watch. The presence of these internationally respected . organizations could add weight to Snowden's asylum bid. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Jen Psaki said Friday the United States . disapproved of Russia facilitating what she called a 'propaganda . platform' for Snowden, 'despite the government's declarations of . Russia's neutrality with respect to Mr. Snowden.' On Saturday, . Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov aimed to keep up the appearance . of neutrality. 'We are not having contact with Snowden,' he said at a . meeting of a regional security organization in Kyrgyzstan, according to . Interfax. The former National Security Agency worker, who revealed details of a U.S. intelligence programme to monitor internet activity has been staying in the transit lounge at . Moscow's Sheremetyevo airport since June 23. Guarded: The world's media were eager to get a glimpse of the fugitive whistleblower who remains at the police guarded transit area of the airport, where the meeting took place . According to Ellen Barry, of the New York Times who was in contact with Tatiana Lokshina, of Human Rights Watch, who was present at the meeting, Snowden said he is recognized as an asylum . seeker by the UN High Commission on Refugees – but the U.S., he said, . does not recognize this, as the Morales plane affair showed. He has urged international organizations to petition the U.S. and EU not to interfere with his right to seek asylum. Referring . to Putin's condition that he . can only stay if he stops harming the U.S., Snowden reportedly  said: . 'No actions I take or plan are meant to harm the U.S. ... I want the U.S. to . succeed.' Snowden told the meeting that he has received offers from Venezuela, Russia, Bolivia, Nicaragua, and Ecuador and he thanked them all. The offer from Venezuela has been made formally. He said he accepts all the offers, present and future.

"Ban: Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has announced a ban on all boat refugees settling in the country . Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd has banned all illegal boat refugees from ever settling in the country. Mr Rudd announced on Friday that all new unauthorised asylum-seekers will be sent to Papua New Guinea under a regional resettlement deal, declaring future boat refugees will have 'no chance' of staying in Australia as refugees. The tough move is designed to prevent people smugglers exploiting refugees and taking vast sums of money putting them on leaky wooden boats with false promises that they will be able to make Australia their home. In a blunt message to the people traffickers, Mr Rudd said: 'Your business model is over. 'These are nothing but false hopes,' said Mr Rudd, who added that Australia would continue to take 'large numbers' of genuine asylum-seekers through its refugee resettlement programme. The Prime Minister said he would impose the changes as soon as possible as he signed the agreement with the promise that there be no cap on the number of asylum-seekers being sent to PNG's Manus Island detention centre. 'From now on, any asylum-seeker who arrives in Australia by boat will have no chance of being settled in Australia as refugees,' Mr Rudd said in Brisbane at a press conference with PNG Prime Minister Peter O'Neill. 'Asylum-seekers taken to Christmas Island will be sent to Manus and elsewhere in Papua New Guinea for assessment of their refugee status. 'If they are found to be genuine refugees they will be resettled in Papua New Guinea - an emerging economy with a strong future, a robust democracy which is also a signatory to the United Nations refugees convention. 'If they are found not to be genuine refugees they may be repatriated to their country of origin or be sent to a safe third country other than Australia.' Mr Rudd said the agreement did not specify an absolute limit to the number of refugees who could be resettled. Crackdown: The tough move is designed to prevent people smugglers exploiting refugees and taking vast sums of money putting them on leaky wooden boats such as the one pictured, with false promises that they will be able to make Australia their home . 'Some will say it's too hard-line, others will say it's inadequate,' Mr Rudd said of his plan, as he sought to present it as a 'balanced' approach that lay between the opposing camps on border protection policy. With a federal election looming, Mr Rudd has been under fire from the Liberal Opposition for doing nothing to stop the boats. He said: 'Our responsibility as a government is to ensure that we have a robust system of border security and orderly migration, on the one hand, as well as fulfilling our legal and compassionate obligations under the refugees convention on the other.” Immigration Minister Tony Burke said the new regime applied immediately - starting with those asylum seekers on board a vessel intercepted earlier yesterday. He said: 'People who are currently within the detention network - within Australia on Manus or on Nauru - do not have these rules apply to them. 'But from now, on vessels that are intercepted will have the new rules apply to them and it will be a couple of weeks because of the health checks ... before the first transfers take place.' Mr Rudd said the arrangement would apply for the next 12 months, and be subject to annual review. Dangerous: There have been several examples of refugee-laden boats running into trouble including this one off Christmas Island in 2010 when at least 27 asylum seekers died . He said: 'Our expectation ... is as this regional resettlement arrangement is implemented, and the message is sent loud and clear back up the pipeline, the number of boats will decline over time as asylum-seekers then make recourse to other, more normal UNHCR processes to have their claims assessed.' He acknowledged that the change would be subject to a court challenge and would add to budget outlays. The Prime Minister unveiled today's agreement in the hope it will undermine the selling points used by people-smugglers, who have sent more than 15,000 asylum-seekers to Australia so far this year. While the Coalition has dismissed Mr Rudd's ability to put his tough talk into action, Mr Rudd is using the new plan to try to address a major political vulnerability ahead of the federal election. Tony Abbott immediately welcomed the initiative as a 'very promising development'. 'But it will never work with Mr Rudd in charge,' the Coalition leader said. He said it was Labour's fifth go at dealing with asylum-seekers and today's agreement remained about processing 'not stopping the boats'. Alternative: Boat refugees will be sent to Papua New Guinea instead (file picture) Neither Mr Rudd nor Mr O'Neill would say how many asylum-seekers would be sent to PNG, despite speculation earlier today that the arrangement would be capped at about 3000 people. Mr O'Neill said: 'We will take as much as we can with the capacities that we have on the ground. 'As you know we are building more capacity to take more refugees and asylum-seekers. 'You can't simply estimate a number given you don't know how many people are seeking such refugee status in the boats that are arriving. 'We are hoping that the boats will stop and there will be nobody coming to Manus, and that is the objective of this arrangement.' Mr Rudd said Australia and PNG would deliver the message 'loud and clear' to people-smuggling networks and criminal elements within Australia helping them. Discussions: Mr Rudd hoped those Nauru arrangements would be built on in the future. He said he had spoken with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon (pictured) about the plan . The hopes they offer their customers for the future are nothing but false hopes,' he said. He acknowledged the implementation of the new regional approach would not be smooth. He added: 'We are bound to run into many unanticipated problems. We will tackle them one by one.' Australia will continue its cooperative offshore processing arrangements with Nauru. Mr Rudd hoped those Nauru arrangements would be built on in the future. He said he had spoken with UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon about the plan. Australia also plans to convene an international conference of transit and destination countries to consider how to improve global arrangements for refugees. The conference would consider the adequacy of processing arrangements and how Australia, the US, Canada and other countries could deal better with the resettlement issues. Mr Rudd said Australia would also seek to develop more regional arrangements at a similar conference due to be hosted by Indonesia. He said: We will also be working with regional partners on visa arrangements for certain countries around the world that have become source countries for irregular people movements.' The new policy increases federal spending on border protection to support an agreement with Papua New Guinea that will see the detention centre on Manus Island expanded from the previous plan to lift its capacity to 600. In exchange for PNG's agreement, Australia will fund further aid initiatives. These include redeveloping a major referral hospital in Lae, PNG's second largest city, and assisting with its long-term management. Australia will also supply half the funding to reform PNG's university sector and in 2014 implement the recommendations of an Australia-PNG education review.","Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd made the announcement today .

"The mysterious death of a 25-year old University of Michigan medical student last Wednesday is being treated as a homicide as friends remember him as a would-be surgeon who 'would have cured cancer'. Paul DeWolf was discovered dead from a gunshot wound in his own bedroom at a university fraternity house on the 200 block of North Ingalls Street he shared with other medical students in Ann Arbor, Michigan. His room was neat and tidy and no valuables had been removed when his body was found at around 11 p.m. - and so far no suspects have been named and no weapon found. Scroll Down for Video . Paul DeWolf (left with his friend Lindsey Gaston and right on vacation) was found dead in his apartment Wednesday. A police investigation began around noon, and university police released a crime alert just before 11 p.m . Crime scene: Police tape is put around the student home of Paul DeWolf after his body was discovered on July 24 . 'Upon officers’ arrival, the apartment was orderly and valuables appeared to have been untouched,' Ann Arbor Police Department Lieutenant Robert Pfannes said in a press release. Following the murder investigation, the University of Michigan has increased campus patrols and warned students that a killer may be on the loose. The university is taking 'all necessary steps to assure the safety of the campus community,' said University of Michigan President Mary Sue Coleman to ABC News. At his home in Western Michigan, DeWolf's loved ones spoke to ABC News of their utter disbelief that the aspiring surgeon has apparently been killed. 'He had such big aspirations for life,' DeWolf's friend Sarala Sarah said. 'He's the type of person who would have cured cancer.' University of Michigan medical student Paul DeWolf was found dead from a single gunshot wound in Ann Arbor and police said on Friday that no firearm was found at the scene of DeWolf's apartment . Joshua DeWolf said his brother was excited about beginning a military career after graduation in May 2014. 'His life came to an end in his prime,' Joshua DeWolf said to Ann Arbor News. 'I have no tears for him,' Thom DeWolf, Paul's father, said at his funeral on Sunday. 'He is released. He is in heaven.' DeWolf is an enlisted second lieutenant in the United States Air Force and was studying at university to complete his surgical training. He was in his fourth year of studying and graduated from Grand Valley State University in Allendale three years prior. Police say DeWolf failed to arrive for a scheduled assignment at the Veteran's Affairs Hospital. The hospital sent a colleague to the home to check on him, and that person discovered DeWolf had died - He was an enthusiastic marathon runner too . In this Wednesday, July 24, 2013 photo, authorities investigate the apartment building where University of Michigan medical student Paul DeWolf was found dead from a single gunshot wound . Another of his close friends, Jason Halterman said that DeWolf had an infectious love of life. 'He loved everyone regardless,' said Halterman to ABC News. 'He taught me to be a better, more caring person and I love him for it.' DeWolf was a frequent poster to Facebook about his passion for scuba diving and running marathons. At his funeral service on Monday, the accomplished student's list of achievements were read out according to Michigan Live. He was the captain of the cross country team at Schoolcraft High School and graduated as class valedictorian in 2006. He took his bachelors degree in bio-medical sciences from Grand Valley State University in 2010 and then joined the Air Force - where he was in the top ten percent certified in officer training. He belonged to Sigma Phi Epsilon at Grand Valley State University and Phi Rho Sigma Fraternity at the University of Michigan. DeWolf was a brilliant piano and French horn player, was a certified scuba diver, traveled the world on several mission trips, and had competed in marathons. He was a devout Christian. A statement from the university said that DeWolf was the 'epitome of everything great in the field of medicine.' 'We extend our deepest condolences to Paul's family, friends and colleagues,' UM president Coleman added to the statement. 'He was working and training among a close, nurturing community of healers and I know they will help each other through this difficult time. They will need the support of the broader campus community in the weeks and months ahead, and we will provide it.'","Paul DeWolf was found dead in his Ann Arbor, Michigan apartment last Wednesday from a single gunshot wound .

(sic) gunna put you in care’. At . one point his father Gary, 46, apparently took over the page, . threatening to report the abusers to police. Josh himself wrote: ‘Last . time I checked, cyber-bullying and “trolling” were a criminal offence.’ Last . autumn two Irish schoolgirls – Ciara Pugsley, 15, from Leitrim, and . Erin Gallagher, 13, from Donegal – took their own lives after being . subjected to anonymous bullying on the site. Her father Jonathan said today: 'It’s just awful. I know first-hand exactly what they’re going through.’ Charron . Pugsley Hill told BBC 5 live's Victoria Derbyshire in June that her . niece Ciara received 'hateful and horrible comments' on Ask.fm, which . contributed to her death. Erin Gallagher had warned users who . had sent her abuse that she would kill herself days before her death. Her sister Shannon Gallagher, 15, was found dead eight weeks later in . another suicide. Double tragedy: Erin Gallagher (left) killed herself at 13 after being bullied online and Shannon Gallagher (right), her best friend and sister, killed herself eight weeks later . Hurt: Ciara Pugsley was also bullied online, . which led to her death, pictured here with her pony at Mullaghmore in . Ireland and Hannah Smith, 14, killed herself last Friday after being . bullied by anonymous trolls online . Message: Dave Smith's message to friends and loved ones as a petition to get Ask.fm banned is launched . In December 2012 Jessica Laney, 16, was found dead at her home in Hudson, Florida, after users on Ask.fm branded her 'fat', a . 'slut' and tormented her over her looks and love life. Messages . on the teen's profile showed the constant abuse that friends . claim pushed Jessica over the edge. One user asked Jessica, 'Can you kill yourself already?' while another comments: 'Nobody even cares about you.' Ask.fm has widely been condemned as a . ‘stalker’s paradise’ and its owners refuse to take responsibility for . the bile trolls can anonymously spout on its pages. Today Hannah Smith's father Dave urged intervention as  'another teenager could be dead next week'. A petition calling for children to be safeguarded has also attracted thousands of signatures. 'Websites like this are bullying websites because people can be anonymous,' he said. 'Ask . Fm and sites like this are making millions out of peoples misery and it . is wrong. I appeal to David Cameron as a Prime Minister and a father to . look at this to make sure these sites are properly regulated so . bullying of vulnerable people like my daughter cannot take place'. Row: Ask.fm says it does not take full responsibility for what is on its site and does not monitor posts, which has led to advertisers leaving them in droves . Trolls have today hijacked a tribute page . created for his teenage daughter. Hannah, 14, was taunted on Ask.fm over her weight, the death of an uncle and an . apparent propensity to self-harm. Under . the header R.I.P. Hannah Smith, American Toby Swaggins Tarrant said: . 'Its (sic) her own fault for taking her own life. its (sic) cowardice. and instead of opening our eyes to the dead we should open our ears to . the living'. Posting: Hannah put this photo online on Thursday, the day before she killed herself . Sick message: The Facebook page set up to celebrate Hannah's has also attracted trolls who have left upsetting messages like this one . Back for more: After the troll was taken to task by Hannah's friends and supporters Toby returned to say how easy cyber-bullying is in a swear-filled rant . Sick: This person then appeared on the page later to revel in Hannah's death, which her family say was caused by trolls who attacked her online . The grieving father of teenage suicide victim Ciara Pugsley said ‘it’s just awful’ to hear another teenager killed herself as a result of online bullying on Ask.fm . Ciara was 15 when she took her own life last September after a relentless campaign of online abuse on ask.fm in the weeks leading up to her death. Her father Jonathan (pictured) told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘It’s just awful- the first thing I think of is offering the family my deepest commiserations.’ ‘I know first-hand exactly what they’re going through and it’s just awful.’ Mr Pugsley said something must be done before another needless death occurs. He said: ‘We need to remove the anonymity from these sites. ‘We simply have to take more action. ‘I commend the people in England who have spoken out. ‘We cannot keep sweeping [cyberbullying] under the carpet, we need to tackle it. ‘You can think everything is hunky dory and think young people are exposed to only good things online, but in reality they can be exposed to terrible things.’ ‘Parents also need to know if their children are on these kind of websites and take immediate action if they are,’ ‘It’s a virtual world, we need to be very aware of that, it’s a struggle to realise what’s real and what is not.’ Mr Pugsley said hearing of Hannah Smith’s death brought back very painful memories. He said: ‘It never goes away, it’s with you every day, and when you hear of cases like this you just feel very sad for the other family, it’s a horrible time.’ After . loved-ones confronted him and called him 'sick' he said: 'Oh for f**** . sake bullying on the internet is soo f****** easy to avoid just turn off . your f****** computer!'. Under . a picture of the teenager with her friends, one sick troll wrote: 'good . b**** killed herself' and another said: 'You f****** c***'. Another troll, using the name Jake . Williams, wrote: 's*** deserved it, ive been bullied and s*** before; . just turn off the computer im actually happy she's dead.' In another he ranted: 'Its funny . because she had a life I, and a lot of other people could of only dreamt . of im actually glad she died, Weak.' He went on to call Hannah a 'selfish . cow', 'filthy scum' and when confronted by one friend who asked why he . was posting such comments he simply replied: 'Why not? It's hilarious.' Taunts and abusive comments written . in teenage ‘text speak’ remained visible on Hannah’s Ask.fm profile . yesterday, which Hannah last used on Thursday. In her final days, she . had been branded a ‘cow’ and ‘fat sl**’ – but had also been praised on . her appearance and told she was ‘fit’ by others. On July 20, a vile troll wrote, ‘u . ugly f*** go die evry1 wuld be happy’, prompting Hannah to reply: ‘yes, i . may be ugly, but you obviously have an ugly personality to tell people . to ‘go die’!’ Other hurtful posts urged her to ‘do us all a favour n kill ur self’ and ‘go comit suicide’. Hannah replied: ‘wouldn’t you fell bad if I did ey?’ Police are examining Hannah’s computer and mobile phone. Ask.fm is not covered by British online safety regulations as it is based in Latvia, which could make it difficult for the British Government to intervene. It has more than . 60million users worldwide. It lets anyone see the names, photographs and personal . details of boys and girls as young as 13. Users post comments that range from . insults to sexual advances and threats of violence. It has been heavily . criticised by anti-bullying charities because it allows users to post . anonymous comments or questions – often of a sexual or insulting nature. Charity BeatBullying said one in three young people were bullied online and Ask.fm is among the worst offender. Founder Emma-Jane Cross said: ‘Young people, as in the tragic case of . Hannah Smith, face a daily barrage of online abuse, death threats and . harassment. ‘Adults . need to set an example for young people and we all have a responsibility . to tackle this type of behaviour and keep our children safe. 'We . want internet service providers, schools, the Government and the police . to come together and produce a UK anti-bullying strategy.’ MailOnline has approached Ask.fm for comment but they have so far failed to respond. The tragedy comes amid a continuing escalation of the abusive and threatening ‘trolling’ of high-profile women on Twitter.","Five children from UK, Ireland and US blamed Ask.fm before their suicide .

"Oops! American emergency surgeon Patrick Broderick, from New Fairfield, Connecticut, was arrested for breaking off the finger . The American tourist who sparked outrage . in Florence after he snapped a finger off a priceless 600-year-old . statue of the Virgin Mary in a museum was today revealed to be an . emergency surgeon from Connecticut. Patrick Broderick, 55, from New Fairfield, Connecticut, was attempting to compare his finger to that on a marble sculpture at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo (Museum of the Works of the Cathedral) when he amputated the digit. What makes the accident even more embarrassing is that married Broderick is an emergency surgeon at Danbury Hospital, Connecticut - surely someone who is better than most with being careful with his hands. And in a further excruciating twist, Broderick was arrested and taken into custody in front of his wife and his two college-aged children. It is believed Broderick was comparing his own hand to that of the statue when the mishap occurred. A security guard spotted him doing it and tried to stop him, but it was too late. Broderick was mortified and apologized profusely, fearing prosecution and a massive fine for damaging the historic piece of work. The sculpture was created in the 14th or 15th century by Florentine Giovanni d'Ambrogio. Timothy Verdon, an American who is the head of the Diocesan Office of Sacred Art and Church Cultural Heritage and the Cathedral Foundation Museum in Florence, condemned his countryman's behavior. Uh-oh: Broderick broke the pinky finger off a 600-year-old marble statue at a Florentine museum over the weekend. A museum administrator said the repair of the statue will be exceedingly complex . The sculpture, seen here before the accident, was created in the 14th or 15th century by Florentine Giovanni d'Ambrogio . National Lampoons: Broderick was on holiday with his wife, Linda, and his two children . Call the doctor: A mortified Broderick was arrested in front of his wife and children . ‘The group were in the Cathedral, looking at the statue of the Vergine e all'Angelo Annunciatore, which is marble and by an artist called Giovanni d'Ambrogio. ‘The man told me it was a spontaneous impulse. ‘He put in hand out in an unthinking gesture to measure the size of the hands of the virgin against those of his own. ‘A guard immediately saw and told him not to touch, but the little finger had come off exposing a metal rod inside. ‘He seemed to have forgotten the basic rule of museums that you don’t touch things. ‘Afterwards he was absolutely embarrassed and very sorry. ‘It was a strange sort of forgetfulness as this man to all appearances seemed like a regular museum goer, not a busman on holiday. ‘It’s not a tragedy as all the fingers have been restored before and are not marble but plaster held with metal rods. And thankfully we have a technical person in the museum who has fixed a finger before.’ The statue is housed at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo, next to the legendary Duomo Santa Maria del Fiore . Many of the most precious works in Florence are actually kept away from the public under lock and key - with casts set out in museums. The originals that are available for public viewing are kept under close guard. A spokesman for the municipal police in Florence said: ‘A 55-year-old man from New Fairfield in Connecticut in the U.S. was arrested at the Museo della Opera in Florence after a statue was damaged. ‘He admitted the offence. He was taken to the station for questioning then released. ‘No charges have been filed by the museum and he has not been asked to pay for the repair.’ Broderick's secretary at his practice today told MailOnline that he was still in Italy and was due back to work on Monday.","Surgeon Patrick Broderick, 56, was measuring the finger when he broke it off the statue .
