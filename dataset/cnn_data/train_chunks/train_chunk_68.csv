"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- A tell-all book by a former ""Girls Gone Wild"" photographer alleges that Paris Hilton once smuggled illegal drugs into Europe using a cigarette box hidden inside her body. Hilton's representative did not comment on the book's allegation when contacted by CNN Wednesday. A copy of ""Flash! Bars, Boobs and Busted -- 5 years on the Road with Girls Gone Wild"" was filed as an exhibit in the publisher's response to a lawsuit aimed at stopping its sale on Tuesday. The lawsuit described the ""Girls Gone Wild"" video series as ""filming real college coeds reveling in spring break."" The video series' founder, Joe Francis, filed suit in Los Angeles Superior Court in July accusing his former employee, Ryan Simkins, of violating confidentiality agreements with the book. ""Simkins agreed orally and in writing not to disclose confidential information or speak publicly in a manner that could harm the reputation of Mr. Francis or the Girls Gone Wild enterprise,"" his suit said. Simkin's legal response contended he was not bound by any confidentiality agreement. ""To the extent the parties previously may have agreed that the defendant would not write about plaintiffs, that agreement was waived by plaintiffs,"" the response said. The book became available online Tuesday despite the lawsuit, according to the publisher's lawyer. Publisher 4th Street Media, named as a co-defendant, submitted the book as an exhibit in a court filing on Tuesday. An excerpt of the filing obtained by CNN described a purported encounter between Simkins and Hilton, who was naked in her dressing room during a photo shoot in Los Angeles. Hilton was about to fly to Europe to meet Francis, whom she was dating at the time, he wrote. Simkins wrote that he was delivering a Camel cigarette package filled with cocaine and Ecstasy to Hilton at the request of Francis: . ""I took out the Camel box and handed it to her, and she thanked me. We talked for a minute or two about the apparent difficulty of procuring those drugs in Europe. I asked if she was flying private, and she said, 'No, commercial.' And then as politely as I could, I asked her how she planned on traveling with that amount of blow and X. ""She held the box in her right hand, and then with an underhand swoop like a lower case J, she demonstrated exactly how she intended to beat airport security. She even whistled as she did it."" He then describes how she placed the box between her legs and into her body. Hilton was arrested in Las Vegas, Nevada, on a cocaine possession charge last month.","The book was written by a former ""Girls Gone Wild"" cameraman .

"Srinagar, India (CNN) -- Pro-India groups Sunday welcomed the latest initiative from New Delhi to defuse the crisis in Indian-administered Kashmir, but a hard-line separatist leader spearheading the unrelenting pro-independence unrest dismissed the plan as ""an eyewash."" Chief Minister of Jammu and Kashmir Omar Abdullah was one of the first to hail the eight-point proposal, describing it as ""a positive development which should lead to resolving the political issues of the state."" Omar said students who had been detained for throwing stones during the violent demonstrations that have so far claimed 106 lives would be released soon, and schools and colleges should reopen Monday so that students will be prepared for annual state board exams. However, he said, one of the main points of the proposal -- to scale down the number of security forces in the area and to withdraw the Disturbed Areas Act in some places -- would be reviewed this week at the unified headquarters meeting. The Indian government had imposed a strict round-the-clock curfew in the summer capital of Srinagar and in several other areas in an attempt to prevent angry mobs from taking to the street. Still, residents -- many of whom favor an independent Kashmiri nation in the Muslim majority Kashmir Valley, part of India's northern Jammu and Kashmir state -- came out hurling stones at police and paramilitary troopers who have in turn, opened fire and used tear gas. State Congress party chief Saif-ud-Din Soz described the eight-point initiative, which was introduced Saturday by Home Minister P. Chidambaram, as ""a good beginning."" The moderate All Parties Hurriyat Conference (APHC) chairman, Mirwaiz Moulvi Umar Farooq, expressed ""disappointment"" with the proposal. He said his group would issue its formal reaction Monday after a meeting of its executive committee. The hard-line separatist leader Syed Ali Shah Geelani dismissed the initiative as ""an eyewash, as it doesn't address the fundamental issue of accepting Kashmir as an international dispute by New Delhi."" It also does not take into account other demands of demilitarization under the auspices of a credible international agency and withdrawal of Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), he said. Referring to the Indian home minister's announcement regarding a plan for dialogue with all sectors of society, Geelani said that by his count, more than ""150 rounds of talks have been held since 1947 between Kashmiris and New Delhi which have, however, yielded nothing."" Kashmir analyst Abdul Quyoom noted that the proposal ""has failed to enthuse the separatist leaders, who have been upping the ante for Kashmir's secession from India."" Also included in the plan is proposed compensation for the families of protest victims of the equivalent of about $11,000 each. Since the latest wave of unrest began in June, 106 people have died. The Indian government says another 245 people were detained. Earlier in the week, Chidambaram, the home minister, led an all-party delegation of Indian parliamentarians to Srinagar to assess the situation firsthand. Delegation members drove through the curfew-bound streets to an international conference center on the banks of Dal Lake, once one of India's most popular tourist destinations. The delegation met with leaders of various pro-India parties. Kashmiri separatist leaders had turned down invitations for talks. Moderate leaders Mirwaiz Moulvi Umar Farooq and Yasin Malik also turned down invitations to join the discussions, but sent a joint memorandum to the delegation reiterating their demands for restoration of normalcy and the initiation of dialogue. Among those demands were demilitarization, the release of detainees and the withdrawal of what they called draconian laws. Claims on the mostly Muslim Kashmir Valley has been a matter of dispute since the independence of India and Pakistan in 1947. India deployed thousands of troops in Kashmir to guard against what Indian leaders believe was a Pakistan-backed insurgency that began in late 1980s. That insurgency, which claimed tens of thousands of lives, has waned but the troops have remained, fueling new waves of separatist unrest.","Pro-India parties welcome the 8-point plan to defuse tensions in Kashmir .

"(CNN) -- Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal made light work of their opening matches on the 2010 ATP Tour circuit on Tuesday, but a man who has beaten the world's top two tennis players suffered an embarrassing defeat. No. 1 Federer brushed aside unseeded Belgian Christophe Rochus 6-1 6-2 in the first round of the Qatar Open in Doha, while second seed Nadal was similarly untroubled in defeating Italy's Simone Bolelli 6-3 6-3. However, world No. 8 Robin Soderling was knocked out in the first round of the Chennai Open in India, where he was top seed. The Swede -- who beat Federer in an exhibition tournament in Abu Dhabi last week before losing in the final to Nadal, on whom he inflicted a shock defeat at last year's French Open -- was beaten in straight sets by American Robby Ginepri. ""Everything went wrong for me,"" Soderling said after his 6-4 7-5 reverse to a player ranked 100th in the world. ""I wasn't hitting the ball well, I didn't take my chances and he took his. ""It doesn't matter whether you have two break-points or three, you still have to take them."" Swiss star Federer should have another easy ride in the second round when he faces unseeded Russian Evgeny Korolev, while Spaniard Nadal takes on another Italian in Potito Starace. The day's most significant result in Doha saw 38-year-old Moroccan wildcard Younes El Aynaoui become the oldest player to win an ATP Tour match since Jimmy Connors, who was 42 when he triumphed at the Halle Open in 1995. El Aynaoui, whose previous competitive match was in May 2008, beat American qualifier Ryler DeHeart 7-6 (7-3) 7-6 (7-4). The 2002 champion, who was runner-up in 1996, earned a clash with Belgian qualifier Steve Darcis, who upset Spanish eighth seed Guillermo Garcia-Lopez 6-4 6-1. Meanwhile, at the Hopman Cup mixed teams event in Perth, hosts Australia eliminated the United States with a 2-1 victory in Group A on Tuesday. Samantha Stosur beat Melanie Oudin 6-2 6-4, then Lleyton Hewitt gave Australia an unassailable lead by defeating big-serving John Isner before the Americans won the mixed doubles. Australia, who have a win and a loss, next face Spain -- who remained on course for a fifth final appearance with a 3-0 drubbing of Romania. Maria Jose Martinez Sanchez won the opening singles 6-4 6-3 against Sorana Cirstea, and then the Romanians had to concede after Victor Hanescu suffered an injury and pulled out at 6-3 down against Tommy Robredo.","Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal win their opening matches on the 2010 ATP Tour circuit .

"(CNN)  -- Android smartphones can do a lot, but unless you're already an Android power user or enjoy configuring a sophisticated device, getting set up on your first Android phone is probably a bit of an ordeal. Speaking from experience, it's definitely not as simple or straightforward as getting started with your first iPhone. Sprint aims to ease the setup process with Sprint ID, a service launched this month for the carrier's new mid-range Android phones. In a nutshell, Sprint is providing preconfigured packages of apps, wallpaper, icons, ringtones and premium content (through partnerships with major media brands). Sprint ID packs are free to download and install, but users are charged for premium content and features delivered through those packs. Users can customize their own phones further, and you can load up to to five Sprint ID packs on a device. This may sound limiting to experienced smartphone users, but it's probably a good enough starting point for most beginning Android users, especially if you just got your first-ever phone that goes beyond what a basic feature phone or messaging phone can do. As a Sprint news release notes: ""According to the Pew Research Center, more than one third of US adults own smartphones, but three out of four of those owners don't use many of the smartphone's features. It's not because they don't want apps that are cool or make their lives easier; it's because finding the right content is simply too confusing, time consuming or even intimidating."" Phonescoop is reporting that Sprint is also rolling out the Sprint ID service for higher-end Android devices -- specifically the Samsung Epic 4G and the forthcoming Samsung Galaxy tablet. It probably would have to come up with far more sophisticated packages to make this service compelling to users of those devices. We'll see what emerges on this front. The Sprint ID concept is intriguing. Basically, it's selling ""skins"" for Android devices. In this case, the purpose is to ease the less-experienced user's setup process and overall experience. But skins for Android devices can serve many purposes for all kinds of users. And the more the device can do, the greater the opportunities for creating compelling skins that integrate a wide range of content and functions. Sprint views Sprint ID not just as a service for the packs it decides to offer, but a platform through which others can create and offer their own custom Android skins. These could be sold or given away either to the general public or a select group of users, such as fans of a particular band or team, or employees of a large company. The October 12 episode of ""The Cell Phone Junkie Unlocked"" podcast included an interview at CTIA with a Sprint representative who explained that the Sprint ID platform basically allows developers to create custom collections of applications, widgets and other tools to serve specific user groups. For instance, many large companies already provide smartphones for their employees. The IT or telecom department of a large company like FedEx or Merrill Lynch might use Sprint ID to deploy an Android skin for its employees that would include access to in-house proprietary tools or information. Employees could activate the job-related skin during the workday, then switch to a personal skin (or no skin) when off-duty. This week's Sprint Developer Conference included several sessions that focus on Sprint ID, so expect to see the list of available public and proprietary Sprint ID packs expanding significantly in coming months. Sprint hasn't yet specified how it will choose those it will allow to create Sprint ID packs. I doubt this carrier's platform would be wide open to any developer for any purpose, like the Android App Market. Also, Sprint ID packs are, of course, available only to Sprint customers, but Android devices are now available on every carrier. Maybe alternative Android skin platforms might arise, and they might be open, rather than tied to specific wireless carriers. Android Central speculated that this strategy may ""spell doom"" for phone manufacturers' custom Android user interfaces like HTC Sense or Samsung Touchwiz. What if you could get an Android skin for the city where you live, or for particular news venues, or organizations that you support? Why not an Android skin for Denver residents, or Texas Republicans, or stock traders, or people who track bills in Congress, or the BBC, or the Natural Resources Defense Council, or Presbyterians? Right now, there are smartphone apps to serve these communities -- but apps aren't everything. A custom skin could allow you to integrate mobile web bookmarks, widgets, messaging services, ticker-style updates and more in one experience that you could turn on and off at will on your phone. It'll be interesting to see how this concept develops and spreads.","Sprint aims to ease the setup process with Sprint ID .

"(CNN) -- You voted: he won. Revered by the masses of moviegoers worldwide, it came as no surprise that Martin Scorsese (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""The Departed"") topped the Screening Room's ""Directors Cut"" poll. Martin Scorsese: You voted him best director in our Screening Room poll . Walking away with 15 percent of your votes, Scorsese's hard-hitting documentary style, quickfire editing, fondness for NYC backdrops and rapport with De Niro make him your top director. Born on November 17, 1942, as a child Scorsese struggled with his health. The movies -- along with the church -- became a haven for him. ""When I was a kid I had terrible asthma -- I didn't go out at all,"" he told CNN at a masterclass at the 2007 Marrakech Film Festival. ""I was out on the streets, yes, but I was not athletic in any way and so the movie theatre was a refuge."" His love for the silver screen led him to devote his free time to watching movies wherever he could -- at the cinema and on TV at home. ""I don't think I was ever happier than when I was alone in our 2, 3-room tenement apartment on Elizabeth Street,"" he recalls. ""My mother and father were at work, my brother was at work. I would come home from school in the afternoon and on television would be 'La Belle et La Bete' by Cocteau, 'The Southerner' by Renoir, Von Sternberg... I would be doing little drawings of them like my own movies. And I never stopped doing that."" Even so, Scorsese almost didn't make it into the movies. Born into the devoutly religious Catholic community of Little Italy on New York's Lower East Side and a devout Catholic, he studied for the priesthood, almost joining the seminary before his passion for filmmaking took his talents elsewhere. ""The ritual of the Catholic Church is important to me. I found it fascinating; I found it moving; I still find it fascinating,"" he said. He entered NYU in 1960 as an undergraduate, where he was taught to make films about what he knew -- his own life. He was also very influenced by the cinema verité movement and the fly-on-the-wall documentary style that was just beginning to emerge at the time. This influence would show up again and again in his student films, and later in ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver"" and ""Mean Streets."" Despite coming from a poor background and not having access to 8mm cameras like many of his university peers, Scorsese dove into film with a passion and was soon a star pupil. Head and shoulders above his classmates, he won every award and scholarship going. When Martin (known to his friends as Marty) Scorsese arrived in Los Angeles in 1971 he was an unknown. He hung out with other young actors and directors, among them Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, all hustling for their big break. Scorsese had made films before, notably a no-budget effort, ""Who's that knocking at my door?"" with a young Harvey Keitel. But it was with ""Mean Streets"" that Scorsese got his big break. ""Taxi Driver"" followed three years later, while 1980's ""Raging Bull"" probably saw De Niro's finest performance under Scorsese. Iconic and violent, 1990's ""Goodfellas"" featured top-drawer performances from Scorsese favorites, De Niro, Ray Liotta and Joe Pesci, while ""Casino"" (1995) drew heavily on its predecessor, with a good measure of extra violence and an Oscar-nominated performance from Sharon Stone. More recently, ""The Aviator"" paired Scorsese with Leonardo DiCaprio, Cate Blanchett and John C Reilly. But it was 2006's ""The Departed,"" a remake of Korean film ""Infernal Affairs"" starring DiCaprio alongside Matt Damon and Mark Wahlberg, that broke the Oscar drought for Scorsese, at last winning him his gold statuette. When CNN asked him at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival what makes a great director, Scorsese said that it is something he finds hard to pin down. ""It's very hard to make these value judgments,"" he said. ""I think one key element in good and great is to have something to say, a voice."" But he added that skill in telling a visual story plays a large part. ""There are directors, filmmakers who simply (and it's not simple at all) know how to put things in the frame,"" he explained. ""They know how to keep a story going, fast and in such a way that and make it entertaining. It may not say much but there's a technical skill that's overwhelmingly difficult to master."" That's a skill Scorsese has by the bucketload -- and one he revels in. ""The designing of the shots is something that I enjoy a lot,"" he told CNN at Marrakech. ""It's the biggest challenge ... When I design and edit a sequence, when I know a shot is going to go from shot A to B to C and then I'll intercut shot C with B and D -- I get very excited about that,"" he revealed. But his favorite part of filming remains the editing process. ""Editing takes me back to being alone and drawing pictures,"" he explained. But his love for the edit suite caused friction early on in his career. ""I had to live in Los Angeles between 1970 and 1981 in order to get to make film and be introduced to the people who allowed me to make films,"" he revealed, ""But I found that I had difficulty sometimes with the way some excellent editors resented the director in the editing room."" Scorsese is famous for his partnerships with leading actors, most notably Robert De Niro and, more recently, Leonardo DiCaprio. Shunned by the Academy for years, Scorsese finally snapped up his elusive Best Director Oscar for ""The Departed"" in 2006. Following his 2005 rockumentary on Bob Dylan, he has just completed ""Shine A Light,"" a documentary following the career of the Rolling Stones.

"(CNN) -- The salmonella outbreak that led to the recall of 380 million eggs was preventable and will likely grow, federal officials said Thursday. Hundreds of Americans likely have become ill from tainted eggs in recent months, according to estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, CDC spokeswoman Lola Russell said Thursday. From May 1 to July 31, a total of 1,953 cases of Salmonella enteritidis were reported; the expected number of such cases ordinarlily in that time would be about 700, Dr. Christopher Braden, acting director of the CDC's division of food-borne, waterborne and environmental diseases, said in a conference call Thursday. The CDC is not yet sure exactly how many cases can be attributed to this particular outbreak. The salmonella outbreak prompted Wright County Egg of Galt, Iowa, to increase its recall Wednesday to 380 million eggs. The number of salmonella cases is expected to grow because any that occurred after July 17 may not yet be reported due to a two- to three-week lag between when a person becomes sick and when the case gets reported in the system, the CDC said. ""We would certainly characterize this as one of the largest shell egg recalls in recent history,"" Sherri McGarry of the Food and Drug Administration said in a conference call Thursday. On July 9, the FDA announced it had new safety rules for large-scale egg producers, but that came after the salmonella outbreak apparently began. ""The outbreak could have been prevented."" McGarry said. ""The egg safety rule is in a phase-in approach, but there are measures that would have been in place that could have prevented this if it been placed earlier than in July."" FDA's new rules cover refrigeration of stored and transported eggs, pasteurization, rodent control, cleanliness and a required written Salmonella enteritidis prevention plan. The agency said ""implementing the preventive measures would reduce the number of Salmonella Enteritidis infections from eggs by nearly 60 percent."" Producers with more than 50,000 laying hens, or about 80 percent of the market, were to comply by now. The regulations requires ""egg producers with fewer than 50,000 but at least 3,000 laying hens whose shell eggs are not processed with a treatment, such as pasteurization, to comply with the regulation by July 9, 2012."" The Center for Science in the Public Interest, an advocacy group, said the FDA needs a strong inspection force. Health departments across the country are tracking cases of salmonella and dispensing advice to citizens. Arizona, for example, has seen a twofold increase in salmonella reports, with an uptick beginning in June, said Dr. Joli Weiss, food-borne disease epidemiologist for the state Department of Health Services. Thoroughly cooking eggs kills salmonella bacteria within, but there is still risk of cross-contamination if a food preparer doesn't properly wash kitchen utensils, such as whisks or spatulas, that came into contact with the raw eggs. Undercooked food also leaves the consumer at risk of infection. Salmonella, which is generally contracted from contaminated poultry, meat, eggs, or water, affects the intestinal tract. Symptoms include diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps, which typically begin within 12 to 72 hours, according to the CDC. Vomiting, chills, headache and muscle pains also may occur, according to the Mayo Clinic. These symptoms last about four to seven days, and then go away without specific treatment in healthy people. Antidiarrheal medications may help with cramps, but they may also prolong the diarrhea, the Mayo Clinic said. The elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are at heightened risk for developing a more serious illness because of salmonella, the CDC said. Some people can develop life-threatening complications if the infection spreads beyond the intestines. Chickens can pass the bacteria to eggs because the eggs leave hens through the same passageway as feces, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service. Alternatively, bacteria in the hen's ovary or oviduct can get to the egg before the shell forms around it, FSIS said. Wright County Egg added several more batches and brands to the recall Wednesday afternoon. ""Wright County Egg is fully cooperating with FDA's investigation by undertaking this voluntary recall,"" the company said in a statement. ""Our primary concern is keeping salmonella out of the food supply and away from consumers. As a precautionary measure, Wright County Egg also has decided to divert its existing inventory of shell eggs from the recalled plants to a breaker, where they will be pasteurized to kill any salmonella bacteria present."" After the uptick in salmonella infections, the CDC and the FDA traced the source and determined it was most likely eggs from Wright County Egg. The company says it is working to determine how the shell eggs are being contaminated. The CDC reported Thursday evening that more than one person became ill in 26 restaurants in 10 states. Information showed that Wright County Egg was an egg supplier to 15 of the restaurants. Krista Eberle, director of food safety programs at the Egg Safety Center, reiterated that only shell eggs are affected by the Wright County recall. ""From what we know they only do shell eggs, and if they did extra egg products, they are still considered to be safe,"" Eberle said. She added that egg products such as egg whites and dried eggs go through pasteurization and extensive heat treatment, so they're considered safe to eat and the Egg Safety Center is not concerned the other products might be sullied with bacteria. Country Eggs, Inc. on Thursday said it is voluntary recalling specific Julian dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg. Eggs were distributed to food wholesalers, distribution centers and food-service companies in California, Arizona and Nevada, according to a statement. Eggs were packaged under the Country Eggs, Inc. brand name in 15 dozen bulk pack with the identifying plant code of P 1946 and P 1026. Julian code dates are 216-221. Dates and codes can be found on the box label. Wednesday's recall covers eggs branded as Albertsons, Farm Fresh, James Farms, Glenview, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma, Lund, Kemps and Pacific Coast and are marked with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 229 and plant numbers1720 and 1942, the company said. In addition, NuCal Foods, which, on its website, calls itself the largest distributor of shell eggs in the western United States, announced Thursday it was ""voluntarily recalling specific ... dates of shell eggs produced by Wright County Egg and packaged by NuCal Foods because they have the potential to be contaminated with Salmonella."" The earlier recall covered the Lucerne, Albertson, Mountain Dairy, Ralph's, Boomsma, Sunshine, Hillandale, Trafficanda, Farm Fresh, Shoreland, Lund, Dutch Farms and Kemps brands that were marked with with a three-digit code ranging from 136 to 225 and plant numbers 1026, 1413 and 1946. The four-digit plant number begins with ""P - "" and is followed by the three-digit code. Both recalls affect eggs packed in several different sized cartons, from a half-dozen to 18 eggs. Only shell eggs are affected by the recall, the company said. Consumers are encouraged to return the eggs in their original packaging to where they were purchased for a full refund. Eggs have not been a major source of infection in humans for this particular strain of salmonella, enteritidis, in the last twoor three years, said Patrick McDonough at Cornell University's School of Veterinary Medicine. A big outbreak like this one is out of the norm, he said. Ideally, when a chick becomes a candidate to become an egg-laying hen, it is put in a clean environment with clean water and feed, he said. But that is not always the case, he said. Rodents can get in the feed, and their feces can transmit bacteria to the birds. One Wisconsin woman infected by salmonella has filed a lawsuit against a restaurant that allegedly served contaminated eggs linked to the nationwide outbreak of the potentially deadly bacteria. Plaintiff Tanja Dzinovic, 27, from Pleasant Prairie, Wisconsin, said she got sick after eating at the Baker Street Restaurant and Pub in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in June. She recently retained the Seattle, Washington-based law firm Marler Clark, which specializes in food poisoning cases, and amended her lawsuit against the restaurant to include Wright County Egg. Drew Falkenstein, the Marler Clark attorney co-representing Dzinovic, said Thursday although she returned to work a while ago, after a week of acute illness, she suffers from ongoing gastrointestinal problems. In the legal complaint, Marler Clark says, ""defendant Baker Street Restaurant and Pub purchased and used in the manufacture of its menu items Salmonella-contaminated shell eggs subject to defendant Wright County Egg's August 16, 2010 recall."" The Kenosha County Health Department closed the restaurant on July 13 to investigate an outbreak of ""at least 30 confirmed Salmonella enteritidis illnesses... including the plaintiff's,"" according to the complaint. The restaurant has since reopened. Falkenstein said even though Wright County has recalled the eggs, Baker Street Restaurant will remain part of the lawsuit. He said when so many people in one restaurant became ill that it should have raised red flags and called the food-handling practices into question. The 30 cases of salmonella reported in Kenosha County came from no specific source and not all the people were connected to the restaurant, said Diane Bosovich, assistant director of nursing for the health department. She wasn't certain how many may have been tied to the restaurant, which she said was closed for a week as ""a precaution."" She indicated that Baker Street Restaurant has been inspected and employees were educated on proper food handling. There were no findings of food-borne sources of salmonella, but she couldn't comment on whether any employees tested positive for the disease at the time. L & K Tricoli, LLC, which owns the Baker Street Restaurant and Pub and two other Kenosha restaurants, did not respond to repeated CNN requests for comment.

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- An official with Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation, a group with alleged links to a banned Pakistani terrorist organization, says the U.S. Agency for International Development's administrator visited a camp the group is running and praised the work being done there. The United States is denying that claim. On Wednesday, the head of USAID, Dr. Rajiv Shah, went to Sukkur, Pakistan, to get a firsthand look at the needs of the flood survivors and how aid is being distributed. He visited two relief camps. One of the camps was inside Double Session High School, where the charity with alleged terrorist ties says it had a banner up in Urdu. Inside the camp, aid was being distributed in big bags from USAID. Representatives from the World Food Program also were there, as was the U.S.-based Save the Children charity. But the Falah-e-Insaniyat Foundation's leader in Sukkur, Khateeb Ullah, said his group is running that camp and others. ""Our charity is running five camps in the city and providing accommodations, food and medicine to 3,500 flood victims. Jamaat-ud-Dawa is supporting us financially and morally,"" Ullah said. Jamaat-ud-Dawa has been banned by Pakistan and the United Nations as a terrorist front group. Hafiz Saeed, the leader of Jamaat-ud-Dawa, has ""provided us dry food in huge quantity to help the flood victims,"" Ullah said. The Indian government has accused Saeed of being the mastermind behind the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, in which 10 Pakistani terrorists took over five-star hotels and a Jewish center in India and left more than 160 people dead. Saeed was put under house arrest but was released by a Pakistani court that cited insufficient evidence. A spokesman with the U.S. Embassy, Richard Snelsire, said, ""They may have had a banner up, and the organization may have been there and distributed aid earlier, but that doesn't mean the group is running the camp."" A statement from the U.S. Embassy in Pakistan later in the day read in part: ""USAID partners have been providing assistance to victims of the flooding at the school since August 16th. The Double Session High School is a Pakistan government school and is under the supervision of the government of Pakistan. At no time during his visit did Dr. Shah encounter or meet with any members of a banned extremist organization."" Foreign Ministry spokesman Abdul Basit said, ""I am not aware of any camps being run by any banned organization."" Although Falah-e-Insanyiat is not a banned terrorist organization, it allegedly is the charity wing of one. Pakistan is a strategic country in the war on terrorism, and analysts say the United States cannot afford to let a lack of Western aid increase the impact of charities associated with militant groups. Amjad Jamal, the spokesman in Pakistan for the World Food Program, which also is providing assistance at the school, said: ""Our systems of engaging partners in every country are very clear. World Food Program does not work with any charity linked to terrorism."" The United States pumped millions of dollars into Pakistan before the floods. With millions more new aid coming into the country because of the flooding, it is insisting the government be transparent about how aid money from around the world is being spent.","Falah-e-Insaniyat says it is operating a camp praised by the head of USAID .

"(CNN) -- War-plagued Somalia, with its crumbling government infrastructure, is the world's most corrupt country, according to a global survey by the international watchdog Transparency International. The group's annual Corruption Perception Index measures perceived levels of public sector corruption. As was the case last year, the 2009 survey found that countries that scored lowest all have something in common: they are fragile, unstable and scarred by war or long-standing conflicts. The group scored 180 countries on a scale of 0 (perceived to be highly corrupt) to 10 (perceived to have low levels of corruption). Somalia scored 1.1. Next came Afghanistan at 1.3, Myanmar at 1.4, and Sudan and Iraq -- both at 1.5 . On the other end of the scale, New Zealand ranked highest at 9.4, followed by Denmark (9.3), Singapore and Sweden (9.2) and Switzerland (9.0). The United States came it at 19 (7.5) and the United Kingdom was at 17 (7.7). ""When essential institutions are weak or non-existent, corruption spirals out of control and the plundering of public resources feeds insecurity and impunity,"" the group said. On the other hand, countries that fared well in the survey have oversight to stem corruption. These include a well-performing judiciary, an independent media, and vigorous law enforcement, it said.","Transparency International's annual Corruption Perception Index measures perceived levels of public sector corruption .

"(CNN) -- November 8, 1994: It was a slaughter. In one night, Republicans seized 54 seats in the House and eight seats in the Senate, capturing Congress for the first time since 1954. The newcomers, many from the South, were predominantly white, male and angry. ""You're going to have a difference in style,"" predicted an Atlanta-based Republican pollster. ""With the Southern Republicans, you get a more aggressive, assertive conservatism. This is a conservatism that has been built on confronting Democrats and liberals, not accommodating them."" Conservative leaders credited Rush Limbaugh, king of angry white men, with propelling the Republican revolution. ""He was the standard by which we ran,"" said former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay. The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, invited Limbaugh to deliver the keynote at its orientation for new lawmakers. Limbaugh encouraged the newcomers to stay mean: ""This is not the time to get moderate. This is not the time to start trying to be liked."" The newcomers listened. Led by House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the angry white men of Capitol Hill shut down the government and spent the next six years trying to drive Bill Clinton from office. Those were the days, my friend. We thought they'd never end. November 2, 2010: Four years after recapturing Congress, Democrats are again cowering in expectation of a brutal Election Day beating. Rush Limbaugh is still angry, but some of this year's Republican candidates take their cues from someone new: Glenn Beck. Where Limbaugh was angry, Beck is paranoid. In his land of make-believe, devious enemies have infiltrated the government and are plotting to destroy America. Every significant phenomenon, from the recession to the BP oil spill, is part of their master plan. Their final objective is a fascist-communist-Big Brother-world-government-über-tyranny, and they will annihilate anyone who interferes, which is why Beck frequently asks listeners to pray for his safety. Just as Republicans channeled Limbaugh's anger in 1994, many of today's Republican nominees exhibit Beck's paranoia. For instance, Rand Paul, the Republican Senate nominee from Kentucky, has described a secret plot to merge the United States into a North American Union under a single currency, sealed by a colossal 10-lane highway from Mexico to Canada. ""It's gonna go up through Texas, I guess, all the way to Montana,"" he explained. ""If you talk about it like it's a conspiracy,"" he said, ""they'll paint you as a nut. ... But I guarantee you it's one of their long-term goals to have one sort of borderless mass continent."" Bill Randall, a Republican congressional nominee from North Carolina, speculated that the government has colluded with BP to create the oil spill: ""Now, I'm not necessarily a conspiracy person, but I don't think enough investigation has been done on this. ... I don't know how or why, but in that situation, if you have someone from a company proposing to violate the safety process and the government signing off on it, excuse me: Maybe they wanted it to leak."" Sharron Angle, Republican Senate nominee from Nevada, has spoken of armed resistance to tyranny. ""You know, our founding fathers, they put that Second Amendment in there for a good reason, and that was for the people to protect themselves against a tyrannical government,"" she warned. ""I hope that's not where we're going, but, you know, if this Congress keeps going the way it is, people are really looking toward those Second Amendment remedies and saying, my goodness, what can we do to turn this country around?"" Christine O'Donnell, Republican Senate nominee from Delaware, checks for political opponents hiding in her bushes. ""They're following me,"" she insisted. ""They follow me home at night. I make sure that I come back to the townhouse, and then we have our team come out and check all the bushes and check all the cars to make sure that -- they follow me."" Some Democrats have cheered these wild-eyed candidates, believing that extremists won't win elections. But history contradicts faith in Americans' moderation. When militant conservatives seized control of the Republican Party in December 1992, one Democratic analyst gloated, ""They are silencing the more moderate elements in their party and seeking an ideological purity from the right. A marginalized, right-wing Republican Party will be less competitive with Bill Clinton in 1996 than a more inclusive and centrist Republican Party."" But while the relatively moderate Bob Dole lost to Clinton, conservative shock troops swarmed into Congress and hobbled his presidency. The way things are going, the incoming Republicans of 2010 will make the class of 1994 look like pragmatic centrists. If so, we can look forward to years of partisan gridlock and poisonous incriminations. In the words of Glenn Beck, ""Buckle up, because trouble is coming."" The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Wolraich.","Michael Wolraich says Rush Limbaugh helped propel 1990's GOP revolution .
But in 2010 midterms, candidates take cues from Glenn Beck, who uses paranoia .
GOP candidates such as O'Donnell, Paul have taken up paranoid theme to tar opponents .

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United's new goalscoring machine Javier Hernandez grabbed a late winner as the holders reached the quarterfinals of the English League Cup with a 3-2 win over Wolves. Mexican international Hernandez, nicknamed 'little pea' strode on to a Darron Gibson pass before beating visiting goalkeeper Wayne Hennessey for his last minute clincher at Old Trafford. Hernandez had been introduced as a late substitute for Bebe, but not before the young Portuguese find had put United ahead early in the second half. It was Bebe's first goal since his surprise summer signing for United from Estrela Amorada. He showed enough in a tepid first half and with his goal, admittedly after a deflection, to suggest that manager Alex Ferguson's gamble on a player he admitted he had not seen play, could pay off. But Wolves threatened an upset with George Elokobi muscling his way through to level from a corner, while the returning Stephen Hunt saw his shot clip the top of the crossbar as United wobbled. Then Korean Park Ji-Sung, having wasted an earlier cast-iron chance, put United ahead again with a clever shot from inside the area. But Wolves leveled again through Kevin Foley and looked set to force injury time until Hernandez, who scored twice in the 2-1 win at Stoke in the Premier League on Saturday, popped up again. ""When he comes on, you just know that if he gets a chance he is going to take it,"" Ferguson told Sky Sports. In other League Cup action, Premier League Wigan beat Swansea 2-0 and Birmingham saw off the challenge of third-flight Brentford in a penalty shoot out. High-flying West Bromwich Albion continued their fine form with a 4-1 win at Sven-Goran Eriksson's Leicester.","Javier Hernandez scores the winner as Manchester United beat Wolves in League Cup .

"(CNET)  -- They're everywhere here: on the sides of buses and along the walls of subway stations, posters for the upcoming film ""The Social Network"" bearing little else than the three words ""PUNK, BILLIONAIRE, GENIUS"" and a partial headshot of lead actor Jesse Eisenberg. Likewise, buzz about the David Fincher-directed film about the contested origins of Facebook, based on Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" has been growing now that its hyped premiere at the New York Film Festival is less than a month away. Its wide theatrical release is on October 1. This week, at least in the mainstream press, the narrative has taken a turn for the speculative: Will the film actually be both a box-office hit and an awards contender? Will Facebook's chilliness toward the movie, which it did not sanction and has characterized as ""fiction,"" affect its performance -- or will a strong performance at the box office affect the public's perception of Facebook? Igniting all these questions is the fact that ""The Social Network"" is apparently not just good, but excellent. The sole long-form review of the film comes from Film Comment, a publication operated by NYFF parent Film Society of Lincoln Center. Critic Scott Foundas characterized ""The Social Network"" as a ""portrait of a self-made outsider marking his territory in the WASP jungle"" akin to F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic ""The Great Gatsby,"" and speculated that it may come to be considered a microcosm of the Digital Age in the same way that ""Gatsby"" encapsulates the Jazz Age. ""'The Social Network' offers a despairing snapshot of society at the dawn of the 21st century, so advanced, so 'connected,' yet so closed and constrained by all the centuries-old prejudices and preconceptions about how our heroes and villains are supposed to look, sound, and act,"" Foundas wrote. ""For Mark Zuckerberg has arrived, and yet still seems unsettled and out of place."" A few others have seen it, too. In a tweet, Rolling Stone magazine critic Peter Travers gave the movie four stars and called it ""the movie of the year that also brilliantly defines the decade."" Whether it actually is as good as a handful of early reviewers say it is, ""The Social Network"" could really be the first major, zeitgeisty film that portrays the ""digital generation,"" or Generation Y, or whatever you choose to call it, as adults -- the film that will be evoked for decades as emblematic of the climate that caused whatever generational neuroses that the ""millennials"" experience down the road. That's something that the film's excellent theatrical trailer, scored with a haunting choral cover of Radiohead's ""Creep,"" starts to drum up with its emphasis on social status, the enormous amount of deeply intimate information shared online through social networks like Facebook, and a snippet set in a nightclub in which Justin Timberlake, portraying former Facebook executive Sean Parker, declares confidently, ""This is our time."" The cast alone may be sufficient to draw crowds. Eisenberg, cast as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, is shaping up to look like a more astute choice than some of the better-known actors who were said to be up for the part -- a young A-lister like Shia LaBeouf or Michael Cera could come across as too played-out by now, or overshadow the rest of the film. The supporting cast may be a big draw, too, in part because of the roles that some of the relatively unknown young actors have lined up for next year. Andrew Garfield, portraying spurned Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, will be the next Spider-Man; Rooney Mara, playing a fictionalized version of a girl Zuckerberg had been dating around the time that he founded Facebook, will be the eponymous ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" in the film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel (also directed by Fincher). Some speculators had wondered whether Timberlake, a pop singer who was gracing the cover of teen magazines with the rest of boy band 'N Sync at the time when his character Parker was an executive at Napster, would be the film's weak link. Perhaps not: Foundas said that the quality of Timberlake's performance is ""surprising."" So what of the concerns about accuracy? ""Inside Facebook, they think the movie will not be good for Mark's image, and that worries them,"" journalist David Kirkpatrick, who wrote the Facebook-authorized ""The Facebook Effect,"" said in an interview with USA Today. The article explained that Kirkpatrick had spoken to the producers of ""The Social Network"" about signing on to a consultant role for the film, but that he ""objected to the story"" and Facebook ""said it would not cooperate on his book"" if he took the gig. In the same interview, Kirkpatrick said that ""The Social Network"" will ""fundamentally misrepresent Facebook's origins"" but that its only real impact will probably be to ""make Mark (Zuckerberg) a celebrity."" Entertainment blog HollywoodNews brought up the fact that while some believe that straying from history cost the 1999 Denzel Washington film ""The Hurricane"" the Best Picture accolade at the Oscars, fictionalizing some detail didn't derail 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind"" from winning the same award. A story in The New York Times about Facebook management's grappling with the potential success of ""The Social Network"" -- including attempts on behalf of the company to lobby for modifications to the script -- mentions that a ""mostly made up"" scene ""that depicted Sean Parker...delivering his dialogue while a pair of teenage girls offer partygoers lines of cocaine from bared breasts"" was in cutting-room limbo. But while this allegedly contested scene in ""The Social Network"" sounds sleazy enough to make the film seem a little bit more lowbrow than your average Oscar contender, it certainly has been pulling in more buzz. When it started to look like the scene was staying in the picture, it instantly became headline-worthy. ""Justin Timberlake's naughty party scene uncut in 'Social Network',"" a HollywoodNews headline read.

"(CNN) -- The DUI manslaughter trial of former New York Yankees player Jim Leyritz is set to begin Monday in Broward County Circuit Court in Florida. Leyritz is charged with driving while intoxicated and causing a crash that killed 30-year-old Fredia Veitch on December 28, 2007. The fatal crash happened shortly after 3 a.m. at an intersection controlled by traffic lights. Leyritz, a hero of the 1996 World Series, had turned 44 the previous day and had spent the evening celebrating at bars in Fort Lauderdale. Attorneys in the case expect witnesses to disagree about whether Leyritz had a yellow or red light as he entered the intersection of S.W. 7th Avenue and S.W. 2nd Street. The front of Leyritz's Ford Expedition hit the driver's side of Veitch's Mitsubishi Montero, causing the car  to spin and roll. Veitch, who lived in Plantation, was thrown from the car and died from her injuries. Leyritz stayed at the scene, where police administered and videotaped field sobriety tests. Police allege the former ballplayer failed the tests; his defense maintains Leyritz was not impaired at the time. More than three hours after the crash, Leyritz's blood was drawn at Broward General Hospital. His blood alcohol level was .14; the legal limit in Florida is .08. Both sides agree that Veitch was intoxicated at the time of the crash. Her blood alcohol was .18 and she was not wearing a seat belt. The defense also says that Veitch was driving without headlights and receiving calls and text messages on her cell phone around the time of the crash. A judge ruled last month that Veitch's conduct and state of mind are not relevant to the issue of whether she had a red or green light. Leyritz's attorney is barred from telling the jury that Veitch was intoxicated, that she did not wear her seat belt and that she may have been distracted by calls and texts on her cell phone. Leyritz maintains that he entered the intersection when his traffic light was yellow and that Veitch caused the crash by running a red light. Under Florida law, if Leyritz caused or contributed to the accident, he can be found guilty of DUI manslaughter, even if jurors believe Veitch shares the blame. He pleaded not guilty and if convicted, the former New York Yankee faces a minimum of four to 15 years in state prison. Leyritz settled a wrongful death case earlier this year, agreeing to pay an initial lump sum of $250,000. He also agreed to pay $1,000 a month for 100 months starting on April 15, 2011. The money is to be paid to Veitch's husband and two children. Leyritz played for the New York Yankees from 1990 to 1996 and returned for parts of the 1999 and 2000 seasons. He is best known for a three-run home run in Game 4 of the 1996 World Series against the Atlanta Braves, which turned the series around for the Yankees. Leyritz also played for the Anaheim Angels, Texas Rangers, Boston Red Sox, San Diego Padres and Los Angeles Dodgers. He was mainly a catcher throughout his career. He retired from professional baseball in 2000. Now divorced, Leyritz lives in Florida, where he is raising his three sons.","Former Yankees player Jim Leyritz goes on trial in a fatal 2007 DUI crash .

"(CNN) -- Pakistan's government is not aware of any threat against international aid workers helping with flood relief efforts in the country, despite concerns from U.S. officials and others. Pakistani Information Minister Qamal Zaman Kaira told CNN Sunday that he knows of no specific threat against the aid workers and that the government has not received any information of such threats. He said if any aid worker requires security, the Pakistani goverment will provide it. Earlier, USAID Administrator Rajiv Shah has addressed reports of threats to international aid workers helping with flood relief efforts in Pakistan, calling it ""deeply saddening that others would choose to use these environments to propagate themselves or to threaten international aid workers."" Shah, who leads the U.S. agency that provides economic and humanitarian assistance worldwide, said Friday that he himself had been forced to leave one food distribution site early due to ""suspicious individuals"" in the area. ""I had hoped to spend more time talking to people in line, but within a few minutes of being there, our Diplomatic Security detail informed me that there were some suspicious individuals in the area and we needed to leave,"" he said. Shah's comments came a day after the U.S. State Department announced it had obtained information about threats against foreign aid workers who are assisting with relief efforts in the flood-ravaged country, where monsoon rains have killed 1,639 people. ""We are concerned that extremist elements within Pakistan may decide to attack foreigners who are in Pakistan helping the people of Pakistan, or may choose at this time to attack government institutions in Pakistan that are responding on behalf of the Pakistani people,"" State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley told reporters Thursday. Shah expressed disappointment at the threats, saying, ""I can't tell you how ... inappropriate that feels when you've been there and you've talked to people who have literally lost everything and are just trying to survive."" At least 17 million Pakistanis have been affected by the monsoon floods that began a month ago, and thousands remain at risk. Crowley said the United States is doing everything it can to ensure that the U.S. and Pakistani disaster response can continue despite the threat. ""The fact that suspicious individuals had been in this site -- in part because they knew I was coming, and the day before, our security folks who had gone out there, of course, hadn't seen any signs of them -- is an indication these are open sites,"" Shah said. ""People can get there. The whole point is to have people who are in urgent need come and get food. So it's just -- it's deeply saddening that others would choose to use these environments to propagate themselves or to threaten international aid workers.""","NEW: Pakistan says it has not received reports of threats .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- To bolster its digital currency, Facebook is deepening ties with digital purchasing provider PayPal, the two companies said at an event Tuesday. After a flurry of partnerships announced at the PayPal Innovate conference, the Web's linchpin payment platform said it will provide a new option for buying inexpensive virtual goods from the largest social network. Facebook currently allows its users to buy Credits, the site's proprietary currency, with a PayPal account. Facebook will add the ability to buy virtual items individually, rather than in increments of $15, thanks to PayPal's new digital goods platform, which was unveiled at the conference. Credits are used to purchase virtual gifts for friends or power-ups in games. Developers making Facebook applications powered by Credits -- such as the Zynga Game Network, which makes FarmVille -- will soon have the option of receiving payments through deposits to their PayPal accounts. ""The gaming industry is often an indicator of what's to come,"" Facebook Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg said during the announcement. ""More people play games on Facebook than on the top three consoles combined."" These features will roll out in the next several months, said Osama Bedier, PayPal's vice president of product development. ""PayPal is already one of the main ways to buy Facebook Credits,"" Sandberg said. ""PayPal took the pain out of transactions."" Facebook also accepts credit cards and payments via cell phone from some wireless carriers. Gift cards containing Facebook Credits can be found at stores such as Target, Walmart and Best Buy. Although PayPal had a partnership in place with Facebook in February, PayPal President Scott Thompson said these new features are a step toward expansions between the two companies. ""Today's announcement was a refinement of our product,"" he said. For Facebook, the Credits product may also need refinement. Sandberg took a moment during her announcement to poll the sizable audience about whether they had purchased Credits. Few people raised their hands. ""Try it!"" Sandberg urged the audience. ""You'll like it."" Facebook has drawn a million developers to make software and widgets that run within or connect with the social network, Sandberg said. ""The games and stuff that have happened on this platform are just amazing,"" Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg said last week during a panel at his company's headquarters in Palo Alto, California. ""Five years out, I think the world is going to look a lot more like Zynga."" But Facebook's platform isn't quite mature. That could have something to do with a flimsy relationship with developers, PayPal's Naveed Anwar said. ""Facebook has done a really good job building out their platform, but one area where they haven't really done a good job is paying developers,"" said Anwar, who is senior director of PayPal's developer network. ""And that's where this partnership comes in."" PayPal announced a number of other agreements, including new ways to use the service to buy things within smartphone apps; using that phone in lieu of a credit card at a few stores in San Francisco; and buying memorabilia using software made for televisions. Next year, PayPal will launch an app marketplace to showcase websites and products that tie into its services.","PayPal and Facebook deepen corporate ties .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- In what is seen as a bow to international pressure to delay implementation of a ban on private security contractors, the Afghan government said Wednesday it will form a committee to plan the phasing out of those contractors without endangering development projects. The committee is to be led by Afghanistan's minister of interior and will include representatives from NATO, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force and major international donors. It will ""develop plans for the disbandment of the PCSs that provide security for development projects and report on progress to the president,"" the Afghan government said in a written statement. It said the phasing out of ""illegal"" security contractors and road convoy security companies ""continues on a priority basis as laid out in the decree."" The committee will prepare a timetable for the dissolution of contractors protecting development projects and submit it to President Hamid Karzai by November 15, the Afghan government said. ""Once approved, 90 days max will be given to each organization before [the] designated dissolution date. Following the completion of [the] plan's implementation, the government of Afghanistan will assume responsibility for providing necessary security for development and reconstruction projects."" The committee will examine development and aid companies and develop plans for them to shift to government security, Interior Minister Bismillah Khan Mohammadi said at a news conference. Convoys run by private security companies will also have to transition, he said. ""This is a very serious matter for the government of Afghanistan,"" Karl Eikenberry, U.S. Ambassador to Afghanistan, told journalists. ""This is a fundamental issue for the people of Afghanistan, for President Karzai. This is about the exercise of sovereignty within this country. It's about the monopoly of the use of force. It's about having the responsibility for and having authority over any armed elements in this country."" The announcement was welcomed by the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan, which issued a statement saying it supports the ""principled stand"" of Karzai's government regarding the proposed ban. ""We are committed to implementation of this decree with a fixed timetable and accept that the international community must respond promptly to President Karzai's long-standing concerns about the conduct of private security companies,"" the U.N. mission said. Eikenberry said earlier in a statement the United States ""strongly endorses"" the United Nations' position. ""We will continue to work on a priority basis and in a spirit of partnership with the Afghan government and international partners to support successful implementation of the decree in a manner that increases Afghan security, strengthens sovereignty and leadership and ensures the continuous predictable delivery of critical international development assistance,"" he said. The United States had previously expressed concern about Karzai's pledge to phase out the country's 52 private security companies by year's end, saying that if implemented, the move would leave critical aid personnel unprotected and unable to continue their work. The United States has been negotiating with the Afghan government over such protection, and had been asking for clarification on which contractors would be allowed to remain in the country and under what conditions they could operate. Earlier this month, the Afghan government clarified exceptions to the proposed ban, saying that firms offering protection to embassies and foreign diplomats would be allowed to continue to operate. The decision ""addressed the concerns of NATO and foreign embassies regarding the private security companies' dissolving process,"" a statement from Karzai's office said. However, it said that other private security companies not engaged in that work ""are a strong threat for the national security and national sovereignty of the country"" and that their dissolution would continue as planned.","Afghan's president has ordered a ban on security companies .

"(CNN) -- U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tried to defuse tensions between China and Japan, a strategic U.S. partner, on Saturday, asking the two rival nations to return to negotiations over a group of Pacific islands under dispute. During a press conference at the ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) summit in Hanoi, Vietnam, Clinton said the United States is willing to serve as mediator in the disagreement, which began to simmer last month when Japan detained a Chinese vessel that collided with Japanese boats in the disputed waters. ""We've recommended to both [Japan and China] that the United States is more than willing to host a trilateral where we would bring China and Japan and their foreign ministers together to discuss a range of issues,"" Clinton said Saturday. ""It is in all of our interest for China and Japan to have stable, peaceful relations,"" she said, . A senior U.S. official told CNN that Clinton had raised the issue of three-way talks with Chinese State Counselor Dai Bingguo on Hainan Island and Foreign Minister Yang Jiechi in Hanoi on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit. She also raised it with Japanese Foreign Minister Seiji Maehara in Hawaii earlier in the week, the official said. China and Japan have historically laid claim to the islands, which lie between the two nations. Called Senkaku by the Japanese and Diaoyutai Islands by China, the uninhabited islands have become the center of an escalating diplomatic spat. On Friday, China's foreign ministry spokesman showed some irritation over Clinton's claim that the Senkaku Islands fall within the scope of a U.S.-Japan security treaty. ""With respect to the Senkaku Islands, the United States has never taken a position on sovereignty, but we have made it very clear that the islands are part of our mutual treaty obligations, and the obligation to defend Japan,"" Clinton said Saturday. ""We have certainly encouraged both Japan and China to seek peaceful resolution of any disagreements that they have in this area or others."" Ma Zhaoxu, the foreign ministry spokesman, said China ""will never accept any word or deed that includes the Diaoyu Islands of the U.S.-Japan Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security."" The crew of the Chinese vessel was released following the incident last month. But the Chinese captain remains in custody, accused of ramming two Japanese boats with his vessel. On Friday, Japan said it will release the captain, but did not offer a time frame. The economic repercussions have been immediate. The Chinese government cut off high-level talks with Japan on coal and increased commercial flights between the countries. The dispute also threatens planned talks on a 2008 agreement to jointly develop gas fields located near the disputed islands and in other parts of the East China Sea. The China-Japan dispute parallels U.S. efforts to curb Chinese claims for territory in the South China Sea, out of fear the increasingly powerful Chinese military could seek to dominate Asian waters. At a regional security forum in Vietnam in July, Clinton waded into thorny territorial disputes in the area, saying Washington was concerned competing claims to the territory undermined international maritime law and commerce. While China has sought to negotiate territorial rights to the South China Sea individually with countries in the region, the ASEAN nations have called for a collaborative resolution. China maintains the disputes should not be ""internationalized.""

"London, England (CNN) -- A major British supermarket chain plans to start selling Viagra over the counter starting Monday. The pill, which treats erectile dysfunction, will be available from pharmacies inside 300 Tesco stores across the United Kingdom, to men between 40 and 65, Tesco said. The men must fill out a questionnaire and be screened for blood pressure, diabetes, and cholesterol before they can purchase the pills, priced at 52 pounds ($81.50) for a pack of eight. They do not need a doctor's prescription. Viagra is already available from leading British pharmacy chain Boots, which charges 55 pounds ($86.22) for four pills, said Shona Scott, Tesco's commercial manager for pharmacy services. The decision to stock it in Tesco means it will be available to more men at half the price. The drug is still prescription-only in the United States, where the Food and Drug Administration has expressed some concerns about sudden hearing loss reported with the pill.","Tesco will sell Viagra over the counter in 300 of its stores .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- NBA player Ron Artest, who gained infamy in 2004 when he jumped into the stands and punched a fan during a game-stopping brawl between fans and players, is seeking public redemption by raffling off his new NBA championship ring for charity. The proceeds, which he hopes will exceed $1 millon, will be used to fund mental health services for youths who can't afford the counseling. Artest became a poster boy for NBA bad behavoir after the 2004 melee, which resulted in his being suspended for 73 games, amounting to a loss of about $6 million in salary, he said. Artest was then playing with the Indiana Pacers, against the home team Detroit Pistons. Upon his return to the NBA, Artest bounced around from the Sacramento Kings to the Houston Rockets and eventually landing with the Los Angeles Lakers, which won the NBA championship last season. It was during the victory celebration that Artest publicly credited a mental health professional with turning his life around, and now he wants to further public acceptance for people in need of mental health care. His court-order anger management therapy transformed him, he said. ""A great psychologist made me reach deep, deep into my lies, deep, deep into my vices. Then I had to tell my wife everything. That totally changed my life,"" Artest said, who's a father of four. As one of the league's premier defenders, Artest made few excuses for his admittedly aggressive behavior, but then a secret slipped out. In front of the largest global TV audience ever for an NBA final game, Artest surprised viewers with an announcement: ""I want to thank my psychiatrist."" With those words, he opened up his personal life, and as a sports celebrity, he took a step toward destigmatizing mental health care, observed Rep. Grace Napolitano, D-California. Napolitano enlisted the help of the NBA star to push the Mental Health in Schools Act, which would provide $200 million in funding for on-site counseling  for students with mental health issues. Artest is also an aspiring rapper. In a recent CNN interview, he revealed that while he publicly thanked a psychiatrist, he actually sees a psychologist. ""I didn't know the difference between a psychiatrist and a psychologist,"" he said. ""Having someone to talk to is very important. And there's no shame in asking for help,"" Artest said. When he was 13, his parents split up. ""As a kid, I had a bad temper,"" Artest said. ""As an adult, I was a bad father, and I had to speak to somebody about that."" Artest kicked off his online raffle Wednesday night with a scheduled appearance on CNN's ""Larry King Live."" Wealthy celebrities have offered to buy his ring outright, but Artest wanted all fans to have a chance at winning his ring. So he decided to hold an online raffle in which all bidders will enjoy a fair shot at the ring. He and his teammates received their rings in a ceremony Tuesday evening before their game against the Houston Rockets in Los Angeles. Artest said he will try not to wear his first and only NBA championship ring, so that the raffle winner will be the first person to put on the diamond-encrusted ring.

"PARIS, France (CNN) -- French Internet users who download files illegally could have their service cut off under a new law enacted by the French government. French filmmaker Luc Besson attended the vote passing the new law into action. The ""three strikes and you're out"" law will see violators getting up to two warnings before their Internet service providers could be allowed to cut service for as long as a year. The tough new legislation sailed through the French Senate this week, even as opponents promised to continue to fight it in the courts. The law sets up a special government anti-piracy agency to monitor ""internauts,"" as French Internet users are called. It will ensure users are paying for movies and music that they download. While there are countries with stricter penalties such as jail time, in France opponents of the law are angry that the new government agency will be outside the judicial process. That means it can disconnect Internet service without oversight. Opponents of the law worry the government agency could be packed with over zealous enforcers who will side with filmmakers and the recording industry, or even invade the privacy of Internet users. The legislation has split France's political opposition, which protested against the new law. The political left -- traditionally supported by performers and artists -- found that on this issue the creative types were on the government's side, seeing the legislation as a way to protect the intellectual rights that are the foundation of their livelihood. Though the new law still faces a court test and may not be compatible with European legislation, the government plans to have the agency up and running by next year.","French Internet users downloading files illegally could have their service cut off .

"(CNN) -- Serbia are through to the semifinals of the world basketball championships in Istanbul after a narrow 92-89 victory over holders and European champions Spain on Wednesday. In a repeat of last year's European final, Serbia gained their revenge when a Milos Teodosic three-pointer with just three seconds remaining secured a thrilling win. Serbia had the upper hand for most of the match, leading by four points at the end of the first quarter and eight points at half-time. Spain rallied in the third quarter and at one stage nine unanswered points saw them take the lead in a see-saw session. However, the period ended with Serbia three points to the good and they held an advantage until 28 seconds from time when Marc Gasol of NBA side Memphis Grizzlies levelled the score. But with Serbia in possession, Milos Teodosic, who plays for Greek side Olympiakos, let the clock run low before unleashing a three-pointer to put his side back in front with just 3.1 seconds remaining. The result means Spain have failed to reach the semifinals of a major  tournament for the first time since the 2004 Athens Olympics. Meanwhile, host nation Turkey continued their march in the competition, reaching the last four with a comfortable 95-68 success over Slovenia.","Serbia through to the semifinals of the world basketball championships .

"(CNN) -- When Democratic Gov. Ted Strickland of Ohio hits the campaign trail before Election Day, you might want to listen, because the outcome his re-election bid could have a direct impact on you -- even if you don't live in his state. The number crunchers at Election Data Services estimate that next year, Ohio is going to lose two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives. It's up to the Ohio state government -- including the governor -- to decide which House members will go: Democrats or Republicans. Imagine if, 10 days from now, the Republicans win control of the House, but by only a one-seat majority. Republican John Boehner becomes speaker. But if a Democrat holds the governor's mansion in Ohio, he could insist that when his state loses two seats, both must be in districts held by Republicans. That means just through redistricting in Ohio alone, the Democrats could take back control of the House. That would affect your life, because everything from education policy to health care and taxes goes through the House, and which party is in control makes a big difference. The balance of power could hinge on who gets elected governor in states far from yours. The scenario painted above is highly unlikely -- in part because Republicans will probably retain control of the Ohio state Senate, and they would force a compromise with their governor. But there's more to this chess game. Ohio isn't the only state that stands to lose seats, and other states will win seats. Texas, for example, is poised to gain four seats. Republicans control the legislature in Austin, and there's a tight race for the governor's  office. Florida stands to gain two seats through redistricting. Republicans control the legislature in Tallahassee, and there's a close contest in the gubernatorial race. New York is likely to lose one seat. Democrats control both state houses, and a Democrat is poised to win the governor's mansion. In all, 18 states will gain or lose representation in the House of Representatives, totaling a change of 24 seats. In most states, it's all up to the legislature, and the governor vetoes or approves the map. Some states have a different process to try to minimize political games, but that's hard. ""If one party has complete control of the process, they will tilt the table to their favor, so their state will be more likely to elect Democrats or Republicans for entire decade,"" until redistricting begins again, explains George Mason University professor Michael McDonald, an expert on the process. Imagine another scenario: On Election Day, Democrats eke out a win and retain control of the House by five seats. But Democrats lose governors and state legislative races across the country. Once redistricting happens next year, those elected state officials could wipe out the Democrats' majority by adding seats Republicans will control and eliminating seats Democrats are certain to control. Democrats in Congress would lose their majority because of politicians elected in a state you've never even visited. Sound unfair? The redistricting process is required by the U.S. Constitution to ensure that every member of the House has an equal population district. It's the main reason we conduct a Census every 10 years, so we can rebalance districts based on where people are living. These new district lines last for 10 years, until the next census. When a state has to change even one seat, all the districts in the entire state stand to be redrawn. Remember, every district has to have population of equal size. That means the whole deck is reshuffled. There are clever ways to draw districts to ensure that one party or another is all but certain to win there. ""A long time ago, people figured out you could do more than rebalance populations so politicians can manipulate the boundaries to their favor,"" McDonald said, adding that manipulation for political gain is ingrained into our politics. ""This is what's called gerrymandering. So the party that controls a state can tilt the balance of power in Washington, D.C."" The origin of ""gerrymandering"" The list of states that will gain or lose seats is released in December. But Election Data Services crunched the preliminary census numbers and estimates that the following states will see changes. Texas will gain four seats, Florida will gain two, and Arizona, Georgia, Nevada, South Carolina, Utah and Washington will each gain one. Ohio and New York will lose two seats, and Illinois, Iowa, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Michigan, Missouri, New Jersey and Pennsylvania will each lose one.","Governors play a big role in the redistricting process .

"(CNET)  -- They're everywhere here: on the sides of buses and along the walls of subway stations, posters for the upcoming film ""The Social Network"" bearing little else than the three words ""PUNK, BILLIONAIRE, GENIUS"" and a partial headshot of lead actor Jesse Eisenberg. Likewise, buzz about the David Fincher-directed film about the contested origins of Facebook, based on Ben Mezrich's book ""The Accidental Billionaires,"" has been growing now that its hyped premiere at the New York Film Festival is less than a month away. Its wide theatrical release is on October 1. This week, at least in the mainstream press, the narrative has taken a turn for the speculative: Will the film actually be both a box-office hit and an awards contender? Will Facebook's chilliness toward the movie, which it did not sanction and has characterized as ""fiction,"" affect its performance -- or will a strong performance at the box office affect the public's perception of Facebook? Igniting all these questions is the fact that ""The Social Network"" is apparently not just good, but excellent. The sole long-form review of the film comes from Film Comment, a publication operated by NYFF parent Film Society of Lincoln Center. Critic Scott Foundas characterized ""The Social Network"" as a ""portrait of a self-made outsider marking his territory in the WASP jungle"" akin to F. Scott Fitzgerald's classic ""The Great Gatsby,"" and speculated that it may come to be considered a microcosm of the Digital Age in the same way that ""Gatsby"" encapsulates the Jazz Age. ""'The Social Network' offers a despairing snapshot of society at the dawn of the 21st century, so advanced, so 'connected,' yet so closed and constrained by all the centuries-old prejudices and preconceptions about how our heroes and villains are supposed to look, sound, and act,"" Foundas wrote. ""For Mark Zuckerberg has arrived, and yet still seems unsettled and out of place."" A few others have seen it, too. In a tweet, Rolling Stone magazine critic Peter Travers gave the movie four stars and called it ""the movie of the year that also brilliantly defines the decade."" Whether it actually is as good as a handful of early reviewers say it is, ""The Social Network"" could really be the first major, zeitgeisty film that portrays the ""digital generation,"" or Generation Y, or whatever you choose to call it, as adults -- the film that will be evoked for decades as emblematic of the climate that caused whatever generational neuroses that the ""millennials"" experience down the road. That's something that the film's excellent theatrical trailer, scored with a haunting choral cover of Radiohead's ""Creep,"" starts to drum up with its emphasis on social status, the enormous amount of deeply intimate information shared online through social networks like Facebook, and a snippet set in a nightclub in which Justin Timberlake, portraying former Facebook executive Sean Parker, declares confidently, ""This is our time."" The cast alone may be sufficient to draw crowds. Eisenberg, cast as Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, is shaping up to look like a more astute choice than some of the better-known actors who were said to be up for the part -- a young A-lister like Shia LaBeouf or Michael Cera could come across as too played-out by now, or overshadow the rest of the film. The supporting cast may be a big draw, too, in part because of the roles that some of the relatively unknown young actors have lined up for next year. Andrew Garfield, portraying spurned Facebook co-founder Eduardo Saverin, will be the next Spider-Man; Rooney Mara, playing a fictionalized version of a girl Zuckerberg had been dating around the time that he founded Facebook, will be the eponymous ""Girl With The Dragon Tattoo"" in the film adaptation of Stieg Larsson's bestselling novel (also directed by Fincher). Some speculators had wondered whether Timberlake, a pop singer who was gracing the cover of teen magazines with the rest of boy band 'N Sync at the time when his character Parker was an executive at Napster, would be the film's weak link. Perhaps not: Foundas said that the quality of Timberlake's performance is ""surprising."" So what of the concerns about accuracy? ""Inside Facebook, they think the movie will not be good for Mark's image, and that worries them,"" journalist David Kirkpatrick, who wrote the Facebook-authorized ""The Facebook Effect,"" said in an interview with USA Today. The article explained that Kirkpatrick had spoken to the producers of ""The Social Network"" about signing on to a consultant role for the film, but that he ""objected to the story"" and Facebook ""said it would not cooperate on his book"" if he took the gig. In the same interview, Kirkpatrick said that ""The Social Network"" will ""fundamentally misrepresent Facebook's origins"" but that its only real impact will probably be to ""make Mark (Zuckerberg) a celebrity."" Entertainment blog HollywoodNews brought up the fact that while some believe that straying from history cost the 1999 Denzel Washington film ""The Hurricane"" the Best Picture accolade at the Oscars, fictionalizing some detail didn't derail 2001's ""A Beautiful Mind"" from winning the same award. A story in The New York Times about Facebook management's grappling with the potential success of ""The Social Network"" -- including attempts on behalf of the company to lobby for modifications to the script -- mentions that a ""mostly made up"" scene ""that depicted Sean Parker...delivering his dialogue while a pair of teenage girls offer partygoers lines of cocaine from bared breasts"" was in cutting-room limbo. But while this allegedly contested scene in ""The Social Network"" sounds sleazy enough to make the film seem a little bit more lowbrow than your average Oscar contender, it certainly has been pulling in more buzz. When it started to look like the scene was staying in the picture, it instantly became headline-worthy. ""Justin Timberlake's naughty party scene uncut in 'Social Network',"" a HollywoodNews headline read.

"(CNN) -- NASA officials said Saturday they are confident that space shuttle Discovery's Wednesday launch will go as scheduled, sending a crew of six astronauts to the International Space Station on an 11-day mission. NASA Test Director Jeff Spaulding said mechanical repairs on the shuttle's system used to pressurize Discovery's right hand Orbital Maneuvering System Pod have been successful. ""Right now we're in a good path to get there,"" Spaulding said. The shuttle is scheduled to launch Wednesday. The targeted launch time is 3:52 p.m. ET, from NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, the shuttle's launch and landing site. Initially, a mechanical problem had forced NASA to delay the final launch of the Discovery, the space agency said Friday. The original Monday launch date was delayed after officials found an air leak in the Orbital Maneuvering System Pod, NASA announced. The weather forecast for Wednesday's launch calls for a 70 percent chance of acceptable conditions, NASA weather officials said. Discovery's 11-day flight is expected to be a ""very busy mission,"" NASA Flight Director Bryan Lunney said. ""After we fly around the Earth about 170 times, Discovery will come home for its last flight,"" Lunney said during a news conference last month. ""The crew is ready to go."" The six-member crew, led by Cmdr. Steven Lindsey, will install a new ""permanent multipurpose module"" called Leonardo on the International Space Station. This will be the 133rd space shuttle mission and the final one for Discovery. The shuttle Endeavour is set to launch February 26, and Congress passed a bill this month authorizing another, final space shuttle mission.","NASA officials confident that Discovery's launch will go as scheduled .

"ISTANBUL, Turkey (CNN)  -- Sevket Sahintas works the night shift driving his taxi around Istanbul, Turkey, from midnight until dawn. Sevket Sahintas says he didn't know anything about photography when he began snapping photos. His route takes him past symbols of wealth old and new: the ornate carved stone gates of a 19th-century Ottoman sultan's palace, the gleaming high-rises in the city's rapidly growing financial district. Periodically, Sahintas stops his yellow cab not for customers, but for photos. Under a roaring overpass, he steps out of his vehicle and walks across the street to two homeless men who sleep huddled on the concrete under a blanket next to a half-finished plastic bottle of water. Sahintas pauses for a moment and presses a button on his small camera. A flash erupts, then he turns and walks slowly back to the car. In addition to being a cabbie, Sahintas is a self-taught photographer. He focuses his lens on the poorest segments of Istanbul's society. Sahintas, who began driving a taxi when he was 19, said he started taking photos five years ago when he began working the night shift.  Watch Sahintas as he photographs street scenes » . ""I saw people on the street in winter. They were cold at night,"" he said. ""To make their voices heard, I wanted to buy a camera and show that these people are living in difficult conditions. That's how it started."" Sahintas takes photos of homeless people, who often sleep barefoot in bus stops next to billboards where smiling models advertise everything from ice cream bars to credit cards.  See the streets through Sahintas' lens » . ""I like to capture those contradictions,"" he said. ""Happy smiling people on the ad boards beside that unhappy person who is trying to sleep. I want the happy people to see that minority and do something about it."" Sahintas also takes black-and-white portraits of the other characters who roam Istanbul's streets at night: dirty street children, garbage pickers, transvestite prostitutes. Eventually, Sahintas' nocturnal perspective on Turkey's largest city began attracting attention, both at home and overseas. This month, an exhibit of his photos titled ""The Other Side of the Night,"" is on display in an Istanbul gallery. ""Basically, we were amazed by his photos,"" said Anna Heidenhain, one of the directors of Manzara Perspectives, the art program displaying Sahintas' work. She compares his photographs to the social documentary form of photography that rose to prominence in the 1930s. iReport.com: Share your view of the world . But Sahintas is the first to acknowledge he approached photography as an amateur. ""I didn't know anything about photography,"" he said. ""I didn't know any technical terms, just an on and an off button."" He keeps an eye out for subjects while driving Istanbul's winding streets. At 2 a.m., he spotted a freelance garbage-picker patrolling Istanbul and hauling giant rolling carts through traffic. Sahintas stopped and met with the man, named Yasar, and offered him a cigarette. Yasar told Sahintas he scavenges packing paper and cardboard boxes from garbage bins for resale to private recycling companies. Working until dawn, he can make the equivalent of $7 a night to feed his family of six. ""We are struggling to earn enough money to buy bread,"" Yasar said, before trundling off into the night with his cargo of paper, a lit cigarette hanging from his lips. This week Turkey, one of the world's 20 wealthiest economies, is holding an annual meeting of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. The delegates are expected to discuss ways to battle poverty and strategies to prevent a repeat of last year's global economic crisis. But Sahintas disagrees with experts who rate economies based on gross domestic product. A country's wealth ""should be related to how that money is distributed,"" he said. ""If all the money is controlled by a few monopolies, I believe it shows a country's poverty, not its wealth."" Sahintas' work highlights the huge income gap in Turkish society. Even though the Turkish economy enjoyed steady growth for much of the past decade, the latest government statistics show that nearly one in five Turks live below the poverty line. During the past year, the economic crisis pummeled Turkey's export-driven industries, pushing unemployment to record highs. The downturn has hit many Turks -- from Istanbul's garbage-pickers, who say there is less useful trash to scavenge, to the city's cabbies, who complain that fewer customers can afford their services. Still, at the station from where Sahintas operates his cab, taxi drivers are quick to heap praise on their colleague. ""We are proud of our friend. We like his pictures, as well,"" Tolga Donmez said between glasses of steaming hot Turkish tea. ""He makes us want to learn new skills, as well."" Despite the attention, Sahintas doesn't make enough money from his photos to earn a living. For that, the photographer has to work the night shift in his yellow cab.","Cabbie's familiarity with cameras once consisted only of ""an on and an off button""

The story goes that, as a child, George Washington chopped down the backyard cherry tree and then admitted the whole sordid affair to his beloved father: ""I cannot tell a lie,"" he is said to have said.

Color me cautious, but I've never been a big believer in allowing children direct access to an ax. Ditto hatchets, swords, tomahawks, muskets, and Barbie. Second, I cannot tell a lie; had I been in that very same situation, there's no doubt in my mind that I'd have looked my beloved father straight in the eye and told a lie.

But try explaining that to a friend who has just spent $200 on a brocade bustle and is flying her parents in from Wisconsin for her off-off-off-Broadway debut. My choices? Well, I can sit through ""Tartuffe"" with a lovely couple from Racine and a running time of two hours and 46 minutes that I'll never get back.

"London, England (CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger says his star player Cesc Fabregas has taken on ""another dimension"" after the Spain midfielder was instrumental in the 6-0 thrashing of Braga in the Champions League. Fabregas grabbed two goals and set up two others as the English side demolished their Portuguese opponents and gave notice of their intent to land the biggest prize in European club football for the first time. After the 23-year-old helped Spain to their first ever World Cup win in South Africa, he was the subject of intense speculation over a move to Spanish champions Barcelona -- the club where he began his career. But after his performance on Wednesday night, Wenger insisted Fabregas ""loved"" Arsenal and is still improving as a player. ""He has taken on another dimension. People forget that he is 23 years old, [an age] where other people start,"" Wenger told the club's official website. ""He is a fantastic influence and it is important that he leads this team to winning and I believe it is a fantastic opportunity for the young players who play alongside him to improve as well. ""He loves this club. People doubted that but I never doubted that. He arrived here at the age of 16 and he enjoys the way we play and what more do you want than to be happy?"" Real Madrid coach Jose Mourinho was equally pleased with his team's performance as they opened their Champions League campaign with a 2-0 home win over Dutch giants Ajax. An own goal from Ajax defender Vurnon Anita and a tap in from Gonzalo Higuain secured victory for the Spanish club, though the Argentina striker and Portugal international Cristiano Ronaldo both squandered several chances. Mourinho, who is aiming to become the first coach to win the Champions League with three different clubs, told Real Madrid's official website: ""We played well. The team's physical and mental strength increases by playing. We can improve little by little. I need time, but I am very optimistic. ""Cristiano and Higuain were great tactically. We had dynamic offense and stayed well-balanced. That is what I need to work on. The goals will come. Some team is going to pay heavily for this lack of scoring and the scoreline is going to be huge. ""Cristiano can solve his scoring anxiety by one day not playing so well and scoring two or three goals. This happens a lot. You play and try your hardest, you build plays, you assist so that the team shines, but you can't score. It can happen, but the goals will come."" German champions and last year's beaten finalists Bayern Munich beat Roma 2-0 and coach Louis Van Gaal was pleased to eventually wear down his Italian opponents. ""We played very well in the circumstances,"" he told the club's website. ""We let the ball do the work, in the first half as well as the second. But we didn't create many chances. However, we never let a very good opposing team get going, although they only came here to defend, which always makes it difficult. ""After 70 minutes, Roma stopped running, because they'd been chasing the ball all night. That's how we play it. The fans need to understand that we need time to run our opponents into the ground. We've scored two good goals, and we could have had two more in the final minutes.""","Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger hails Cesc Fabregas' performance against Braga .

"(CNN) -- American sprinter Tyson Gay handed world and Olympic champion Usain Bolt his first 100 meters defeat in two years in Sweden on Friday night. Gay, the 2007 world champion, beat the all-conquering Jamaican for the first time as he triumphed at the Diamond League meeting in Stockholm. The 27-year-old came home in a time of 9.84 seconds despite the race being marred by two false starts, while Bolt was second in 9.97. Record-holder Bolt, who won three gold medals at both the 2009 world championships and 2008 Olympics, was last defeated by compatriot Asafa Powell -- also in the Swedish capital. Powell pulled out of this event due to injury worries, meaning the world's top three sprinters have yet to run together this year. ""You can get beaten, you have good days and bad days -- it was just one of those days for me,"" Bolt told British race broadcaster the BBC. ""I need to work on my shape. I got a good start but there was no power there. ""I was ready, I was focused but those two stand-ups kind of threw me off. But I can't blame it on that. Tyson was much better than me, in much better shape than me."" Gay was delighted despite not beating the best time this year, 9.82, set by both Bolt and Powell. ""It feels good. Deep down inside, I felt he wasn't 100 percent. I'm still waiting for the day when we are both 100% and Asafa is also on the line,"" Gay said. ""I think [Bolt] knows what his limitations are. I know he has more left in the tank."" Trinidad's Richard Thompson was fourth in 10.10, while American Trell Kimmons was fifth in 10.11 ahead of Jamaica's Mario Forsythe (10.20). U.S. runners filled out the rest of the field, with Mike Rodgers clocking 10.21, Travis Padgett 10.22 and Monzavous Edwards 10.29. It was a good night for the United States, with Bershawn Jackson winning the men's 400m hurdles in a meeting-record time of 47.65 seconds and Allyson Felix victorious in the women's 200m. In the men's 800m, Poland's Marcin Lewandowski beat Britain's Michael Rimmer in a repeat of the European Championships final last weekend. Kenya's Mark Kosgey Kiptoo won the men's 5,000m ahead of fellow Africans Dejen Gebremeskel and Imane Merga, both of Ethiopia. European champion Tatyana Firova won the women's 400m race and her fellow Russian Darya Klishina triumphed in the long jump. Other gold medallists from Barcelona also prospered, with Croatia's Blanka Vlasic repeating her high jump victory and Russia's Svetlana Feofanova winning the women's pole vault. Olympic and European men's javelin champion Andreas Thorkildsen suffered a surprise defeat to Finland's Tero Pitkamaki. France's Teddy Tamgho won the men's triple jump in the absence of world and European champion Phillips Idowu of Britain. The Diamond League is a 14-event series spanning Europe, China, the Middle East and the U.S. featuring the world's top athletes. There are three more meetings left this month in London, Zurich and Brussels.","The world's fastest man Usain Bolt suffers shock defeat to Tyson Gay .

"Manchester City's designs on the English Premier League title were dealt an early blow as an injury time penalty from Darren Bent handed Sunderland a shock 1-0 win. It was Roberto Mancini's first defeat of the season but his team should have escaped with at least a point after a glaring miss by Argentina striker Carlos Tevez. City dominated the early stages but when Yaya Toure powered into the penalty area and pulled the ball back for Tevez, the striker somehow managed to miss an open goal. Sunderland keeper Simon Mignolet then pulled off a smart save to deny Toure just before the break but the home side came into the game in the second period. Mignolet was again forced into action in the closing stages by striker Emmanuel Adebayor, as he made a superb reaction save. Then as the game entered the fourth minute of added on time Micah Richards hauled down Bent inside the penalty area. The striker picked himself up and converted the spot kick. At Anfield, a Fernando Torres goal gave Liverpool a 1-0 win over newly-promoted West Brom as they bounced back from their thrashing at City last Monday. The Spain striker volleyed home the winner just after the hour mark after good work down the left from Dirk Kuyt to hand new coach Roy Hodgson his first league win. Everton are still searching for their first win of the season after they went down 1-0 at Aston Villa. Defender Luke Young grabbed the only goal of the game in the ninth minute as he fired home from Ashley Young's pass. Everton dominated the game after they went behind but couldn't find a way past veteran American goalkeeper Brad Friedel, who made a string of excellent saves. In Sunday's early game, Bolton fought back from two goals down to draw 2-2 with Birmingham despite having their goalkeeper Jussi Jaaskelainen sent off. Alex McLeish's side took an early lead when defender Roger Johnson stabbed home Lee Bowyer's left wing cross after just four minutes. Then after Johnson had gone up for a high ball with Jaaskelainen after the half hour mark, the goalkeeper slapped him in the face and received his marching orders. Birmingham went further ahead when striker Cameron Jerome nodded a cross into the path of Craig Gardner and the midfielder poked home at the second attempt. But Bolton halved the deficit when Kevin Davies was fouled by Gary Cahill inside the penalty area and converted the resulting spot kick. Their comeback was completed by Robbie Blake's spectacular free kick in the 81st minute and though Jerome had a late chance to win the game, substitute keeper Adam Bogdan ensured Bolton escaped with a point.","Sunderland beat Manchester City 1-0 at the Stadium of Light .

"Shanksville, Pennsylvania (CNN) -- First lady Michelle Obama and former first lady Laura Bush on Saturday led the commemoration for the victims of Flight 93, which crashed and burned as passengers and crew fought hijackers determined to strike the U.S. Capitol on September 11, 2001. Standing on a windswept outlook at the site of the future Flight 93 national memorial, the first ladies remembered the 40 people who took off from Newark International Airport in New Jersey nine years ago, and found themselves in combat with four al Qaeda terrorists. ""I come here as an American, filled with a sense of awe at the heroism of my fellow citizens. I come as a wife, a daughter, and a sister, heartbroken at the loss so many of you have endured,"" Obama said to survivors and family members of those who died. They were part of a throng of dignitaries and locals who came to the annual event. Obama said the people on the plane were from different backgrounds and walks of life. ""They all took a different path to that September morning. But in the awful moment when the facts became clear and they were called to make an impossible choice, they all found the same resolve. They agreed to the same bold plan,"" she said, referring to their decision to attack the hijackers. ""They rose as one. They acted as one. Together, they changed history's course. In the days that followed, when we learned about the heroes of Flight 93,"" we were ""proud,"" ""awed"" and ""inspired"" but not surprised because the people on the plane had provided service and sacrificed much in their daily lives, she said. Obama and Bush praised each other in their words. Obama thanked her predecessor for helping the nation heal after the attack, and Bush praised her successor, saying she was pleased ""to be here with the first lady who serves this country with such grace."" Bush noted that the terrorists who hijacked the plane had other targets in mind, but the spot near Shanksville, Pennsylvania, ""was chosen by the passengers of Flight 93, who spared our country from even greater horrors."" ""As we gather to remember those who were lost and honor their courage, we are deeply grateful,"" she said. Speaking generally about 9/11, Bush praised the first responders in Shanksville, the rescuers at the Twin Towers in New York and the Pentagon, and the millions who took part in blood drives, vigils and memorial services. In the wake of the attacks, Americans said prayers in Hebrew, English, and Arabic, and ""we found unity in shared grief."" Speaking about those who lost loved ones and still feel the wounds of loss, she said ""we know the memories of your loved ones have not aged by time."" ""You inspire us with your grace and strength,"" she said. She also praised those ""who oppose radicalism and terrorism at this very hour in Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places around the world. On this day, Americans have no division."" Others who spoke at the ceremony were Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell, Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, and Gordon Felt, president of Families of Flight 93. As each name of the 40 victims were read, a bell was rung. A chorus and a string quartet performed and clergymen spoke and prayed.","First ladies Michelle Obama and Laura Bush remember the passengers' bravery .

"(CNN) -- I'd been to the club several times before. I love to come to New York and any time I got a chance, when Les Paul was still alive, I would always try to schedule to see him play. It was a thrilling night. I had brought my Rock and Roll Hall of Fame program for Les Paul to sign; the bonus of having Sir Paul there too was incredible. He seemed very, very cordial. Now he was having a good time, too -- because that was in the early stages of his relationship with the lady we don't even mention any more. At one point, Sir Paul got up on stage with Les Paul and started clowning around with him, saying how much the Beatles loved him and stole his songs but had never been able to give him any credit. So he got a one-dollar bill and handed it to Les, who was just beaming. I approached him after the performance to have my book signed and take a photo. There were only about sixty people in the club, it's a very small room, so Sir Paul gave everyone at the Les Paul performance a very special experience. CNN iReport: See more of your encounters with music icons . He looked every person in the eye; you could see the electricity coming from his eyes to theirs and he was just so gracious. I think he really enjoys being one of the normal people, and not being on a pillar. I had met him once before after a concert, very, very briefly, but this was something special. I've been a huge Beatles fan from day one, when I was ten years old and watched the Ed Sullivan Show, the television program that introduced the Beatles to the United States. I'm a musician myself, I play bass guitar with a little band in Atlanta, where I live. We love making music and that was inspired by Sir Paul.","Music fan Rick Glover met guitar legend Les Paul and former Beatle Sir Paul McCartney .

"Washington (CNN) -- Tea Party euphoria confronted reality Sunday, with Delaware Senate primary winner Christine O'Donnell backing out of scheduled talk show appearances amid talk of possible civil war among Republicans over the conservative movement. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski accused the Tea Party Express of infusing money and lies into her Republican primary to swing it against her. Now waging a write-in campaign to retain her seat, against the wishes of mainstream Republicans, Murkowski told CNN that fellow party members were inciting inner-GOP conflict. ""What happened in my particular race, you had the Tea Party Express, this California-based group, come in at the last minute in a campaign, run a mudslinging, smear -- just a terrible, terrible campaign, with lies and fabrications and mischaracterization,"" Murkowski said on CNN's ""State of the Union"" program. ""They came in, they dumped $600,000 into a small market here in Alaska, and they absolutely clearly influenced the outcome of that election."" Murkowski accused conservative GOP Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina, who backed her victorious opponent in the primary, of undermining fellow Republicans. ""I don't think that it's particularly helpful to undercut fellow Republicans, but as I say, it's his prerogative,"" Murkowski said of DeMint, later adding: ""I think that he has made people uncomfortable. I think that he has kind of rattled the cages. Whether it advances to a full-on civil war, I don't know."" On the same program, DeMint said in a pre-recorded interview that his efforts have helped Republican chances of regaining control of the Senate in November's mid-term elections. ""The only reason we have a chance at a majority now is in large part for the candidates I've been supporting,"" DeMint said. DeMint's support for Joe Miller over Murkowski and for O'Donnell in Delaware, who defeated veteran Republican Rep. Mike Castle in Tuesday's Delaware primary for Vice President Joe Biden's former Senate seat, caused consternation in GOP party circles. Some fear such extreme conservative candidates can't win statewide races and are unprepared for the scrutiny of such a campaign. O'Donnell added to such concerns by canceling previously agreed-to interviews on ""FOX News Sunday"" and the CBS program ""Face the Nation,"" deciding instead to make appearances in Delaware. Bob Schieffer, the host of the CBS program, said on air that O'Donnell's representatives denied she withdrew because of videotape released over the weekend showing her talking about dabbling in witchcraft. Whatever the reason, O'Donnell continued to serve as a lightning rod for analysis of the influence of the Tea Party movement. She was given little chance of defeating Castle, but received late support from former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as well as Tea Party money, and pulled off the upset. Now the 11-year-old ""witchcraft"" video and others becoming public are reinforcing the image preferred by Democrats of O'Donnell as an unknown, untested and risky candidate. Republican strategist Ed Rollins acknowledged the problem on the CBS program, saying O'Donnell was off to a rocky beginning. ""Right now this campaign's about her,"" said Rollins, who is a CNN senior political analyst. ""Unless she gets her ship righted ... this is not a good start."" Another top GOP strategist, former Bush White House aide Karl Rove, softened his earlier criticism of O'Donnell, whom he described as unelectable last Tuesday. Appearing on the FOX program, Rove joined other mainstream Republicans in supporting the O'Donnell campaign but called Murkowski's write-in campaign selfish and ultimately unsuccessful. ""She's going to lose,"" Rove said. ""Who would've thought that one of the most conservative states in the country ran the risk of having two liberal Democrats who follow the Obama line representing in the United States Senate? And that's what she could do as a spoilsport."" He added: ""This is sad and sorry."" At the same time, Rove denied there was ""civil war"" between the Tea Party movement and Republicans. Democrats conceded that the Tea Party movement reflects real anger and frustration with continuing high unemployment and the growing federal deficit. However, Democratic National Committee Chairman Tim Kaine, the former Virginia governor, told CNN that voters now have clear choices for the November elections with the primary season completed. ""I think the Republicans are moving way to the right of the American electorate,"" Kaine said of the Tea Party movement's influence. CNN's Alexander Mooney and Mariano Castillo contributed to this story.","Murkowski says conservative colleague undermines fellow Republicans .

"(CNN) -- The good news is that improving economies in developing nations is allowing more people to eat better, but the United Nations estimates that nearly 1 billion people will still face chronic hunger this year. The Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme estimated that 925 million people, almost three times the population of the United States, will go hungry. That's down from 1.023 billion people in 2009 and the first decrease in 15 years. ""But with a child dying every six seconds because of undernourishment related problems, hunger remains the world's largest tragedy and scandal,"" said FAO Director-General Jacques Diouf in a statement. ""This is absolutely unacceptable."" More than 40 percent of the hungry live in the two largest nations, India and China. Only 19 million of the world's undernourished live in developed countries. The United Nations attributed the lower number to renewed economic growth expected this year, particularly in developing nations, coupled with a drop in food prices since mid-2008. However, recent spikes in food costs could hamper a further reduction of hunger, the FAO warned. Among the study's key findings were: . • Two thirds of undernourished people live in just seven countries -- India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Indonesia, China, the Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia. • The region with the most undernourished people continues to be Asia and the Pacific, with 578 million. • But the proportion of undernourished people remains highest in sub-Saharan Africa -- at 30 percent in 2010, or 239 million.","Global hunger declines for the first time in 15 years .

His autobiography, ""Coming Clean,"" said he used human growth hormone to revive his body.

"Fromelles, France (CNN) -- Lawrence Vincent was 21 years old when he joined the Australian Army. The year was 1915 and the world was at war. He waved goodbye to his 6-year-old brother and was shipped halfway around the world to the fields of France to fight the Germans, arriving the summer after he enlisted. His war lasted one hour. Vincent was one of thousands of young men ordered to charge into German machine guns on the night of July 19, 1916, outside this neatly kept French village. The defenders mowed down thousands, killing so many the allies could not recover all their dead. That's how World War I was fought -- waves of young men charging on foot at enemies who were dug in and waiting with guns at the ready. Millions of soldiers died. The remains of about 165,000 troops from the British Empire alone have never been found, according to experts. That single night at Fromelles, 5,533 Australians and 1,547 British troops were killed, wounded or left missing in action. More than 90 years after the battle, Fromelles remains the single deadliest 24 hours in the history of the Australian army. About 1,600 Australian and British bodies were never recovered. Vincent's body was one of the ones that disappeared. His family was left with nothing but an envelope full of medals to remember him by -- an envelope that lay unopened in Australia for decades after his death. But this year -- nearly a century later -- Lawrence Vincent's body was identified. Two years ago, researchers found a series of mass graves near the site of the Fromelles battle. They contained 250 bodies buried by the Germans after the slaughter. Over the past 15 months, experts have worked painstakingly to identify as many as they can, using uniforms and personal effects, military records, and DNA samples contributed by potential relatives of the dead. So far, 96 bodies had been positively identified. On Monday, the 94th anniversary of the battle, a new cemetery was dedicated to be their final resting place. The last of the 250 bodies -- an unknown soldier -- was laid to rest with military honors in the presence of relatives, dignitaries and their fellow troops. Britain's Prince Charles and Quentin Bryce, the governor-general of Australia, marched behind the coffin of the last soldier to be interred at the cemetery, called Pheasant Wood. ""We dedicate this cemetery in grateful memory of all those in the land forces in the Commonwealth who died in the cause of freedom,"" Charles said, referring to the association of nations that used to be part of the British Empire. ""Particularly those who fought and died during the battle of Fromelles and the 250 soldiers whom we remember especially today,"" Charles said. ""May we ever be mindful of them and their comrades in arms of all services and be guided by their example of loyalty, service and selflessness."" Efforts to identify the remaining bodies will continue at least until 2014, according to the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, the non-profit group that is leading the project. The commission commemorates the dead of both world wars from the Commonwealth. Founded in 1917, it maintains graves and memorials at 23,000 sites around the world. The Fromelles cemetery is its first new graveyard in nearly 50 years, spokesman Peter Francis said. The Rev. Mitchell Collins came from Scotland for the dedication, although his grandfather's body was never found. For him, the event was about ""the efforts by people to bring alive, somehow, everybody who died,"" and taking comfort in knowing that although his grandfather -- also named Mitchell Collins -- never knew his descendants, ""you've done something for them."" The body of Lawrence Vincent now lies in a marked grave at the cemetery. He is known as ""Uncle Laurie"" to John Vincent, the son of that 6-year-old little brother to whom Lawrence waved farewell in 1915. The younger Vincent is himself an Australian Army veteran of Vietnam, and he sees a parallel between those who came home from the controversial Vietnam War and those who never came home at all from the First World War. ""They never received the gratitude of the nation that they were entitled to,"" he said -- until the dedication ceremony on Monday. ""For the family, what it means is we can say, 'Thank you Laurie, on behalf of the family and on behalf of Australia.'""","Thousands of soldiers died in a single night in a battle in France in 1916 .

"(CNN Student News) -- March 15, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Connecticut • British Columbia, Canada • Washington, D.C. Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: You can beware the Ides of March, but there's nothing to fear about today's broadcast of CNN Student News. Reporting from the CNN Center, I'm Carl Azuz. First Up: Health Care Push . AZUZ: First up, President Obama postpones a trip overseas so that he can stay in Washington and work on health care. He's called it the top priority for the U.S., and the president, along with Democratic leaders in Congress, all think it's important for him to stay in the U.S. to help rally support for the health care reform bill being considered by lawmakers. A House committee is scheduled to hold a vote on it today. Republicans are against President Obama's health care plan. Some want to scrap it and start over. Yesterday, on CNN's ""State of the Union"" with Candy Crowley, a top Republican in Congress talked about why a health care bill hasn't passed yet, and President Obama's top political adviser discussed why it might pass now. REP. JOHN BOEHNER, (R) MINORITY LEADER: They tried to do this in June and July last year. If they had the votes, then it would be law. They tried to pass it in September, October, November, December, January, February. Guess what? They don't have the votes. The American people don't want to take the step toward government-run health insurance. It's a dangerous step, because we do have the best health care system in the world. DAVID AXELROD, WHITE HOUSE SENIOR ADVISER: We're very optimistic about the outcome of this process. I think people have come to the realization that this is the moment, and if we don't act now, there'll be dire consequences for people all over this country. Severe Weather . AZUZ: Heading up the coast to the northeastern U.S. now, where some areas are recovering from severe storms over the weekend. And we mean huge storms. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania: all of them hit with heavy rains and hurricane force winds gusting over 70 miles per hour. The storms knocked down trees, affected air travel, left more than half a million people without power. One official said part of the reason the trees and utility poles fell over is because the ground was so wet from all the snow that the region's been hit with this winter. The force of nature also being felt on the other side of North America. An avalanche struck a snowmobile competition in British Columbia, Canada on Saturday. As of yesterday afternoon, authorities said two people had been killed and 30 others were injured. USNS Comfort . AZUZ: The USNS Comfort is on its way back home after spending nearly two months helping out earthquake victims in Haiti. The Navy hospital ship is expected to arrive at its home pier in Baltimore, Maryland by the end of this week. Saturday, the Comfort pulled in to Norfolk, Virginia. It had been in the harbor of Port-au-Prince since January, a base for medical care for victims of the catastrophic quake that hit Haiti. Staff on the Comfort performed more than 800 surgeries during the mission. There were times when 10 different operating rooms on the ship were all running simultaneously. Female Football Coach . AZUZ: Natalie Randolph, whom you see right here, is a science teacher at Calvin Coolidge Senior High in Washington, D.C. Science teacher, though, is not her only title. Randolph is the school's new, head varsity football coach. She's been an assistant coach at other schools and she's played women's professional football. It is extremely rare for a high school football team to have a female coach, and some women's groups are calling this announcement historic. Randolph says history is not her focus. NATALIE RANDOLPH, COOLIDGE HIGH SCHOOL HEAD FOOTBALL COACH: Some people will undoubtedly want to focus on my gender, and they'll focus on the historical meaning of this day. But I would much rather focus on something that all dedicated coaches already know: I'm here to give these young men, these student athletes, these wonderful students, the best opportunity and guidance to succeed in the classroom, make good decisions at home, and perform well on the football field. And while I'm proud to be part of what this all means, being female has nothing to do with it. I love football. I love football. I love teaching. I love these kids. Promo . AZUZ: CNNStudentNews.com.

We don't know whether Sal Kahn did anything special yesterday. What we do know is that Mr. Kahn has a gift for numbers, and he's sharing that gift with the world. Dan Simon explains how. (BEGIN VIDEO) DAN SIMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT, SAN FRANCISCO: Sal Khan lives in California outside of San Francisco. Sara Shadid, halfway around the globe in Dubai. Their lives are interconnected, but Khan doesn't know it. This is a story about how one man is helping to educate the world, but has never seen any of his students face-to-face. Where does this passion come from? SALMAN KHAN, YOUTUBE CALCULUS TEACHER: You know, I think I have always enjoyed teaching. SIMON: It is about a man who gave up a lucrative career in Silicon Valley for what might look like a boring desk job. KHAN: Right now, I'm cash-flow negative. SIMON: But it was never about money. And with his drive and education, Khan could have made millions. He was valedictorian of his high school with a perfect math score on the SAT. Then came MIT; Bill Clinton handing him his diploma. Next, Harvard Business School. He was lured into hedge funds and did well. But Khan, who has a wife and son to support, gave it up. KHAN: A lot of people thought I was kind of crazy. Obviously, you know, when every waking hour you have, you would sneak into a room and make math videos and put them on YouTube, people kind of questioned what's up. SIMON: Here is what is up: Khan's YouTube videos. KHAN: Let's do a couple more examples and I think you might get it. KHAN: They have been clicked on more than nine million times from users around the world. The topics range from math to chemistry to economics. SARA SHADID, CALCULUS STUDENT: From every curriculum, we can use the videos. He's really helpful. SIMON: One of his users: 19-year-old college sophomore Sara Shadid in Dubai. She says that the videos made all of the difference in helping her conquer calculus. This gigantic virtual school originates from the smallest of places, from a tiny converted closet inside Sal's master bedroom. This is where he is able to reach an estimated 80,000 knowledge-seeking users a month. It all started a few years ago when a cousin wanted some online math tutoring. Pretty soon, other relatives started asking for similar help. Suddenly, people he didn't know started watching. It is now called the Khan Academy. The videos are short and simply produced; only his voice with a simple black background and graphics. KHAN: There are a lot of people who need help with their math, science, whatever. And I think they find these YouTube videos as kind of the ideal nuggets to fill in their gaps.

"(CNN Student News) -- August 25, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Iraq • Los Angeles, California • Japan . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: What does it take to be the most expensive school in America? You're going to find out in the next 10 minutes. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News is now in session! First Up: Home Sales Drop . AZUZ: First up today: the economy. We have a new report about sales in the housing market. They're not good. Sales of existing homes -- homes that have already been built -- dropped more than 27 percent in July. They haven't been this low in more than 10 years. Some experts think a big reason for the drop is the fact that the government's homebuyer tax credit ended. Basically, that offered people money to help them buy a house. Without that incentive, the sales went down. And the stock market noticed too. When the home sales report came out yesterday, the Dow Jones Industrial Average took a hit. A lot of people use the Dow to figure out how the entire stock market is doing. Obviously, a drop in home sales is a bad thing. But why is this such a big deal? Why did it affect the stock market? Some analysts think the drop in home sales is a warning that housing prices might go down. They're concerned that that might make it harder for the U.S. economy to recover from the recession it's been in. Iraq . AZUZ: Turning our attention to the war in Iraq. For the first time since that conflict started in 2003, there are fewer than 50,000 U.S. troops in the Middle Eastern country. One White House official explained why it's the right time for a change. JOHN BRENNAN, WHITE HOUSE COUNTER-TERRORISM ADVISOR: We can anticipate that al Qaeda in Iraq will try to argue that they have been successful. But they are wrong. We are reducing our footprint in Iraq under our terms, and through a transition to over 600,000 Iraqi security forces who have proven up to the task. AZUZ: Okay, there is still violence in Iraq. Yesterday, attacks killed at least five people. How will that affect the U.S. troops who are still there? Arwa Damon has more on the transition. ARWA DAMON, CNN CORRESPONDENT: And end to Operation Iraqi Freedom and the beginning, on September 1, of Operation New Dawn. Now, this is officially being called a non-combat mission that is going to see the U.S. military in an advise-and-assist capacity. This does not, however, mean that the war has somehow miraculously come to an end, or that a switch was flicked that would allow peace and prosperity to flourish in Iraq. Those troops remaining here will still be wearing their full battle kit when they leave their bases. They'll still be carrying their weapons and they will still be on high alert as this does remain an active and dangerous war zone. Race to the Top . AZUZ: It's a race with 10 winners. It's the government's ""Race to the Top,"" an education program that offers money to states who put together plans for school reform. 35 states and the District of Columbia applied for the current round. D.C. was one of the winners, along with Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, Massachusetts, as well as New York, North Carolina, Ohio and Rhode Island. They'll split $3.4 billion, although how much they get will be based on the number of students in each state. So you can expect New York to get a lot more money than Hawaii.  Now some critics of ""Race to the Top"" argue that it could end up actually hurting some school districts. And others have raised questions about the criteria that led to these states winning out over other states. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Wind speed determines the difference between a tropical storm and a hurricane. It's true! A tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach 74 miles per hour. Hurricane Danielle . AZUZ: And that's why Tropical Storm Danielle became Hurricane Danielle Monday evening. Though yesterday, it did drop back down to a tropical storm. Danielle is the fourth named storm of this year's Atlantic hurricane season, but it's only the second storm to become a hurricane. It's out in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean, and the National Hurricane Center says that it probably won't hit land. Most Costly School . AZUZ: Most expensive American school ever. This place opens next month in Los Angeles, California. And take a look at it: It's not only big, it's luxurious. An auditorium modeled after a famous nightclub. Seating like an upscale restaurant. A basketball court floored in maple wood. Your school doesn't have this stuff! Then again, your school didn't cost $578 million. The Robert F. Kennedy Community Schools is a complex for kindergarten through 12th grade. It'll fit 4,200 students. It is a public school! The area's superintendent says now the poorest children in his school system will have one of the most beautiful learning environments. But in a district that's cut academic programs and laid off almost 3,000 teachers in the past two years, some say this just goes way too far. Los Angeles officials say it was planned before the recession, and that the money didn't come out of California's indebted education budget, but from bonds that voters approved. Blog Promo . AZUZ: But as they say, the proof is in the puddin'. Will a school like this improve students' education? We want you to comment on this on our blog. What makes a good school, good? Is it in the facility itself? Or is it in the students or teachers or... What do you think? Talk to us at CNNStudentNews.com! Shoutout . JOHN LISK, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Time for the Shoutout! What is the official currency of Japan? If you think you know it, shout it out! Is it the: A) Yuan, B) Ruble, C) Yen or D) Dinar? You've got three seconds -- GO! Japan's official currency is the yen. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Yen v$ Dollar . AZUZ: Different currencies get compared against each other to figure out how strong they are. Right now, the yen is doing great! Against the U.S. dollar, the yen is higher than it has been in 15 years. But that can be bad news for expatriates in Japan, people who live there but who weren't born there. Kyung Lah helps makes cents out of all this. (BEGIN VIDEO) KYUNG LAH, CNN CORRESPONDENT, TOKYO: Americans Andrew Wright and Ai Kawano are getting a crash course in the currency market. ANDREW WRIGHT, AMERICAN EXPATRIATE: I'm kinda surprised, actually. The yen is so high now. AI KAWANO, WRIGHT'S WIFE: I feel like my income is really decreased from that time. LAH: Your income didn't change, it's just currency. AI: Yeah, it's not changed, I know. It's only the currency. PAULA SHIOI, AMERICAN EXPATRIATE: Going down, down, down. LAH: That's the paycheck pain shared by expatriates who get paid in dollars or euros and have to pay for food in yen. But it's the opposite side of the coin across town at the Shinjuku bus station. The Komatsus are heading off to an overseas vacation. TOMOKO KOMATSU, TOKYO RESIDENT [TRANSLATED]: ""I upgraded the room and reserved a more expensive restaurant,"" says Tomoko Komatsu. LAH: They're planning their next getaway before they've even taken off on this one. That's the power of their yen overseas. What it boils down to is the value of the U.S. dollar. Let's say these sushi erasers cost 100 yen. Three years ago, given the value of the U.S. dollar, I would have spent 79 cents in the exchange. Fast forward to today. For the exact same sushi erasers, I now have to spend $1.18. Analysts say this reflects the overall global downward trend of the U.S. dollar. EISUKE SAKAKIBARA, AOYAMA GAKUIN UNIVERSITY: Currency does reflect such a trend in the world economy. LAH: Professor Eisuke Sakakibara says that trend is the move away from the U.S. and Europe to developing superpowers of India and China. Currency is just the symptom of a world's economy shifting its center of gravity. SAKAKIBARA: They indicate the further weakness of the U.S. economy. This trend we have experienced in the last month or so will probably accelerate. LAH: That spells trouble for big exporters like Toyota, who at this recent earnings announcement based its sheets on a 90 yen. Analysts say Toyota loses an estimated $250 million when the dollar dips one yen on the currency market. WRIGHT: Checking out the food, we're just moving in. LAH: And it means tough times for the Wrights, who are new Tokyo transplants. Learning to live without, while their Japanese counterparts live it up. Kyung Lah, CNN, Tokyo. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: We've been doing a lot of animal stories for our ""Before We Go"" segment lately, and some are cute. This, you might could go either way on. It's about... well let's just say I smell a rat. And it smells great! Or at least it's going to after its bath. An iReporter sent in this video of his rat Tinkerbell -- he named it Tinkerbell -- Tinkerbell apparently loves taking baths and does all the washing herself. You can see right here: She's got her whiskers, her face...she might've missed a spot. Nope, she got it.  There is another possibility here, that Tinkerbell doesn't like getting wet, doesn't like taking baths, but her owner dunked her in the sink anyway. Goodbye . AZUZ: And now she's trapped like a...heh, heh. All right. Well, maybe the owner just wanted to show off his pet's good hygeine. Either way, we totally had to rat him out. We're going to scurry away for now. CNN Student News returns tomorrow. In the meantime, don't forget to head to our blog at CNNStudentNews.com. Talk to us about what makes a great school great.

"(CNN) -- Marathon man John Isner survived another epic on his return to competitive tennis after his record-breaking 11-hour Wimbledon match. The American saved two match points before beating Gilles Muller, from Luxembourg, 4-6 7-6 7-6 to seal his place in the quarterfinals of the Atlanta Tennis Championships. It is Isner's first tournament since Wimbledon back in June when his opening round victory over Frenchman Nicolas Mahut in London clocked in as the longest match in tennis history. Isner's battle with Mahut stretched over three days and 183 games before he finally triumphed, 6-4 3-6 6-7 7-6 70-68. He later told CNN: ""I really didn't think it was going to end."" Isner reflects on 'crazy' Wimbledon match . The match turned Isner into a household name in the sport, and after his straight sets defeat to Thiemo de Bakker in the second round the 25-year-old targeted a prolonged period of rest. But on his return to the court he was made to work hard by Muller, saving two match points and firing 33 aces as he won in two-and-a-half hours to delight the 5,000 strong crowd. ""I didn't want to let [the fans] down,"" Isner told the ATP tour website. ""I didn't want to lose my first match here. Also, I had a lot of friends and family here, so I didn't want to go out early. ""I hadn't seen a live ball in quite some time and Gilles was never going to give me rhythm with his lefty serve. I felt I was shedding the rust off in the second and third sets. I will only keep getting better. ""As a tennis player you need a lot of matches to play your best. This was one of the biggest wins of the year. I wanted to get matches under my belt before D.C. and the two Masters 1000s."" Isner was catapulted to a new level of fame after his marathon match but the world number 19 insists he wants to be remembered for more than just a first-round Wimbledon victory. ""I'm ranked in the top 20, I think I can still improve and keep climbing,"" he said. ""My goal is to reach the top 10 and contend at the really big events. ""The match was pretty ugly to be honest, but I was proud how I competed and the crowd helped in that regard. ""I was down break points a couple of times in the second set -- they were kind of baby match points with the way he was serving."" Isner will now face fellow American Michael Russell in the last eight.","John Isner wins on first outing since his record-breaking Wimbledon tournament .

"(CNN) -- More than eight years after a Utah teenager disappeared from her bedroom on a summer night, the man authorities believe masterminded her kidnapping is set to stand trial in federal court. Brian David Mitchell, 57, is accused of snatching then-14-year-old Elizabeth Smart at knifepoint from her family's Salt Lake City home on June 5, 2002 -- a crime that shocked the nation and the city, which was then basking in the glow of the 2002 Olympic Winter Games a few months earlier. Mitchell faces federal charges of kidnapping and transporting a minor across state lines for improper purposes. Jury selection in his trial is scheduled to begin Monday in Salt Lake City. In the months that followed Smart's disappearance, her anguished parents, Ed and Lois, became a familiar sight in the media as they continued to plead for their daughter's safe return. But no one expected what happened in March 2003, when Smart was found walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy in the company of Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself ""Emmanuel,"" had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. Utah prosecutors charged Mitchell with six felony charges of kidnapping, sexual assault and burglary. But in July 2005, a Utah district court judge ruled him incompetent to stand trial, leaving him in custody at the Utah State Hospital. However, the state case against Mitchell was put on hold when federal authorities stepped in. A grand jury in 2008 indicted Mitchell and Barzee. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball found Mitchell competent to stand trial in March. Barzee, 64, pleaded guilty in November 2009 to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor in federal court and was sentenced in May to 15 years in federal prison. She also pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court to conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping in an attempt to kidnap Smart's cousin a month after Smart was kidnapped. She was given a sentence of one to 15 years, to be served concurrently with the federal sentence, and given credit for the seven years she had spent in custody. As part of her plea agreement, Barzee agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband. However, her name does not appear on a witness list filed by federal prosecutors -- and does appear on a list of witnesses filed by the defense. Smart, her mother and her younger sister, Mary Katherine -- who was sleeping in the room with Smart the night of the kidnapping and was the only witness -- all appear on the prosecution's witness list. Mitchell's attorneys attempted to move his trial, saying it should be held outside of Utah because publicity in the case had prejudiced the pool of potential jurors against him and jeopardized his right to a fair trial. Kimball denied that request in August, and defense attorneys appealed his ruling to the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Denver, Colorado. A three-judge panel on the appeals court denied the request last week, saying it was premature since jury selection had not taken place. ""It is possible that a jury could be seated where all the jurors would satisfy Mr. Mitchell's view of impartiality,"" the 10th Circuit ruling said. Defense attorneys in July said in court documents that they intend to utilize an insanity defense and intend to introduce expert testimony relating to an alleged mental disease or defect. Now 22, Smart testified as part of Mitchell's competency hearing last year that after taking her -- still dressed in her red pajamas -- from her home, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified he repeatedly assaulted her during her months in captivity, and that he and Barzee took her to California before returning with her to Utah. The federal court summoned 600 jurors to fill out a preliminary juror questionnaire in the case, according to court documents. About 500 potential jurors attended the sessions on September 30 and October 1. Some were released on hardship grounds, the documents said, but about 330 jurors completed the questionnaire. Kimball narrowed that number down to slightly more than 200 potential jurors, according to The Salt Lake Tribune newspaper.","Brian David Mitchell's attorneys will use insanity defense .

"(CNN) -- The question of whether the Tea Party will have a real impact on American politics (yes!) has evolved into a new debate: Is the Tea Party really about more than taxes? Glenn Beck, who invokes the semi-mythical ""Black Robe Brigade"" -- fighting preachers he claims led the American Revolution -- as a model for a new generation of activists seems to think so. On public radio, Bryan Fischer, a leader of the fundamentalist American Family Association, sternly instructed a libertarian Tea Party activist that her movement was religiously rooted whether she wanted it to be or not. A recent poll by the Public Religion Research Institute backs him up, revealing that 57 percent of self-identified Tea Partiers agree that ""America is and always has been a Christian nation."" So is the Tea Party a religious movement, too? The answer is a little tricky. It didn't begin as one, despite the political God-talk of its heroine, Sarah Palin, but it is becoming one, thanks in large part to one man, Sen. Jim DeMint of Greenville, South Carolina, the GOP's newest and fastest rising star. DeMint, who has been out front of his party with vigorous support for Tea Party candidates from Alaska to Delaware, has been looked at as a bridge builder between the insurgent right and the establishment right, because he sympathizes with the former even as he's a Washington insider. But a better metaphor is gatekeeper: DeMint holds the key to the capital for outsider candidates like Alaska's Joe Miller and Delaware's Christine O'Donnell. And the price of admission he's charging is fealty to his religious vision of the Tea Party as a new ""Great Awakening."" That is, a Christian crusade akin to the 18th century evangelical movement that set the tone for so many religious surges in American life that many contemporary evangelicals call the United States a ""revival nation."" The Republican Party -- at least, the establishment Republican Party -- doesn't have a lock on that energy. In Alaska, Sen. Lisa Murkowski was a reliable conservative, but primary challenger Joe Miller swept past her in September buoyed by anti-abortion voters who thrilled to his pledge to oppose ""the culture of death."" In Delaware, Republican Rep. Mike Castle was a sure thing for Joe Biden's old Senate seat -- until he got beat by ""fringe"" candidate Christine O'Donnell, previously best known for her public campaign against masturbation. Liberals and centrists wring their hands over Miller and giggle about O'Donnell, hoping that her political hopelessness somehow proves that the movement isn't going. They compile lists of what they take to be her craziest statements, such as her confession that as a young woman she dabbled in witchcraft. That's a strategic mistake, because they're mocking what is, in fact, a mainstream evangelical view -- that witchcraft and ""spiritual war"" are real -- and a narrative with powerful resonance in American life. Consider not O'Donnell's words, but her theme: Once I was lost (making bad choices), but now I'm found. Who didn't do something stupid in their youth? But it's the ""found"" part that reveals the religiosity of the Tea Party movement, spirituality not at odds with the Tea Party's economics but intertwined with it. DeMint stumbled through an explanation for the Christian Broadcasting Network: ""People are seeing this massive government growing and they're realizing that it's the government that's hurting us. And I think they're turning back to God in effect is our salvation and government is not our salvation and in fact more and more people see government as the problem, and so I think some have been drawn in over the years to a dependency relationship with government, and as the Bible says, you can't have two masters."" DeMint's solution is to put government -- and the economy -- in the service of Jesus, to cultivate a ""leadership led by God,"" as the religious organization that gives DeMint not only a theology but also a roof puts it. DeMint is a longtime resident of the C Street House, the ""Prayboy Mansion,"" as some bloggers have called it, made infamous in 2009 for its role in the sex scandals of Sen. John Ensign, R-Nevada, and Gov. Mark Sanford, R-South Carolina, and maintained by a fundamentalist movement known as the Fellowship, or the Family. C Street has a singular goal, in the words of one Family leader: to ""assist [congressmen] in better understandings of the teachings of Christ, and applying it to their jobs."" It's C Street's understanding of those teachings, though, that mark it as a nexus for the convergence of the Tea Party's populist conservatism and insider influence of fundamentalism's elite (besides DeMint, GOP hard right leaders Sen. Tom Coburn, Ensign, Sen. John Thune, and Sen. Sam Brownback have lived there). The best way to help the weak, C Street teaches, is to help the strong, who will in turn dispense God's blessings to the rest of us. Call it trickle down religion. The rhetoric of the Tea Party is populist in style, but its economic vision so neatly aligns with the interests of the wealthy that big business is abandoning the old Republican establishment for the ""insurgents"" who promise to free the market's ""invisible hand"" from the safety net of the minimum wage and health care. And for DeMint and the new disciples he hopes to bring to Washington, that invisible hand ultimately belongs not to the market but to God. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeff Sharlet.","Jeff Sharlet says anti-tax Tea Party shows signs of evolving into religious movement .

"Washington (CNN) -- The Chinese military continues to expand its reach and capabilities beyond its immediate geographical area, a new report from the U.S. Department of Defense concludes. The report, an annual assessment sent to Congress, notes that some of those capabilities have been positive, like humanitarian and anti-piracy efforts, but others are meant to give China ""extended-range power projection."" While China's continued effort to be able to sustain military operations far from its shore are concerning to the U.S. military, ""China's ability to sustain military power at a distance, today, remains limited,"" the report says. As in the past, the U.S. program to sell military equipment to Taiwan continues to create tension with China and has led to cessation at times of military relations between the two countries. The assessment notes that China has the most active ballistic and cruise missile program in the world, including developing anti-missile technology. Also of concern are Chinese efforts to develop a long-range anti-ship ballistic missile with a reach of more than 900 miles, which would include areas in which the U.S. Navy is active. Such a measure would give the Chinese military ""the capability to attack ships, including aircraft carriers, in the Western Pacific Ocean,"" according to the report. The Chinese could start building their first aircraft carrier this year, and China has started to train pilots to operate off such carriers. It already has a Russian carrier that it is refurbishing. Its naval muscle is also being flexed with additional nuclear powered submarines, and it has nearly completed a navy base on Hainan Island, ""with direct access to vital international sea lanes,"" which will allow for ""stealthy deployment of submarines,"" the report says.","A Pentagon report on China's military cites the U.S. military's concerns .

"(CNN) -- The crew of a tour boat that sank in a collision in the Delaware River last week made radio calls to a vessel involved in the crash, but those calls went unanswered, federal investigators said Monday. The tour boat crew told investigators that they made radio calls to the vessel Caribbean Sea that were not answered, the National Transportation Safety Board said. The Caribbean Sea was towing a barge that collided with the tour boat, causing it to sink in 55 feet of water, the report said. Two people died. One of five crew members of the Caribbean Sea, meanwhile, invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to meet with investigators, the safety board said. ""We remain confident the NTSB will shed light on all of the facts surrounding this accident. Our mutual goal is to ensure nothing like this ever happens again,"" said Chris Herschend, president of Ride The Ducks. Since RTD Philadelphia began in 2003, there has never been a serious accident and only a handful of mechanical breakdowns, company officials said. The tour boat, the DUKW 34, carried 35 passengers and two crew members when it experienced mechanical problems about five to 10 minutes before the crash, the NTSB report said. That problem led the ship's master to anchor the tour boat. Meanwhile, the Caribbean Sea approached, towing a barge. Around 2:36 p.m., the bow of the barge hit the small tour boat, causing it to sink, investigators said. People who operated several vessels in the area have told federal investigators that they heard the tour boat's radio calls. The National Traffic Safety Board said it's looking into those accounts. The agency noted that some -- but not all -- such radio calls are recorded. Two people died as a result of the collision -- Szabolcs Prem, 20, and Dora Schwendtner, 16. Both were from Hungary.","Crew of tour boat said it made radio calls before collision .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- A U.S. citizen was shot to death Sunday in a confrontation with the Mexican military at a checkpoint in Guerrero state, U.S. and Mexican officials said Monday. U.S. officials said they have received conflicting reports as to whether Joseph Steven Proctor, 32, fired at the Mexican military first. Proctor died, the U.S. State Department said, when he either tried to drive through the roadblock and the military shot at him or he opened fire as he drove through the checkpoint and soldiers shot back. Records indicate Proctor recently lived in the metro Atlanta, Georgia, area and has relatives in New York. A woman who answered the telephone at his New York address and who identified herself as Proctor's mother said she was waiting to hear from U.S. officials as to what happened. The woman, who was crying gently, declined to give her name. Asked if she had heard reports that her son had fired at the Mexican military, she answered, ""I've heard that. I don't believe that."" The woman said she did not know how Proctor died. ""I need their information,"" she said. ""I want to find out what happened."" A spokeswoman at the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City said local officials were investigating the circumstances of Proctor's death, ""which are still unclear."" Rodolfo Gomez Fernandez, an official with the Guerrero state prosecutor's office, said ""it appeared to be true"" that Proctor had been shot by the Mexican military. Proctor's body was found around 2 a.m. Sunday inside a red pickup truck on the federal Acapulco-Zihuatanejo highway near the town of Cerrito de Oro, the government-run Notimex news agency reported. The state of Guerrero, on Mexico's southern Pacific coast, is home to Acapulco, a popular tourist destination. CNN's Laurie Ure and Arthur Brice contributed to this report.","Joseph Proctor, 32, was killed at a military checkpoint in Guerrero state .

"New York (CNN) -- AT&T apologized to a customer Thursday after one of its agents left a message on a customer's voicemail warning him that he would receive a cease-and-desist letter after the customer e-mailed AT&T's CEO directly about some complaints. Giorgio Galante, an AT&T customer and iPhone owner since 2008 from Buffalo, New York, told CNN that he was dissatisfied with the company's handling of questions surrounding his iPhone upgrade eligibility dates.  He was also displeased with the recent news of AT&T's pricing plan restructuring, which, among other things, will end unlimited data plans. He decided to e-mail CEO Randall Stephenson directly about his issues . ""Please don't have one of your $12/hour 'Executive Relations' college students call me -- I've found them to be generally poorly informed (Engadget.com readers know more than they do about AT&T) and they have little authority to do anything sensible,"" reads a portion of Galante's e-mail to  Stephenson.  He posted this e-mail, along with the offending voicemail, on his blog, ""So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish,"" which he began Wednesday after receiving the message. ""After I sent the e-mail out [last week], on Wednesday I got that nasty gram back in the form of a voicemail,"" Galante told CNN. The message, left by an employee at the company's Executive Response Team, warns Galante that if he continues to e-mail the CEO, ""a cease-and-desist letter may be sent to you."" AT&T told CNN on Thursday in a statement about the incident, ""We are apologizing to our customer. We're working with him today to address his questions and concerns. This is not the way we want to treat customers. From Facebook to significant customer service channels, AT&T strives to provide our customers with easy ways to have their questions addressed."" Galante said he wasn't necessarily expecting a response from Stephenson, but he felt that he was at least providing customer feedback to the CEO.  He said that he accepted AT&T's apology but wondered why Stephenson was so ""out of touch"" and wished he had received a phone call directly from the CEO. Galante said he received a personal phone call from a senior vice president at the company. He said the executive was ""extremely apologetic"" and asked whether there was anything she could do to keep him as a customer.  No such luck for AT&T, as Galante is switching to Sprint's new HTC Evo phone immediately.

"(CNN) -- Just about everyone who worked to build the new Interstate Highway 35W bridge in Minneapolis, Minnesota, knew that their project would never be ""just a bridge.""  It would never occupy the same category as thousands of other concrete and steel behemoths that millions of American drivers thoughtlessly cross every day. On August 1, 2007, the deaths of 13 people and the injuries of 145 others made sure of that. On that Wednesday evening, unforgettable live video showed cars and trucks tossed into the Mississippi River like toys amid the massive wreckage of the original I-35W bridge, which had somehow collapsed while thousands commuted home from work. Three years later, family transformed by bridge disaster  The tragedy left Americans wondering about the safety of bridges and tunnels in their hometowns. Later, the tragedy threw a world of attention on the new bridge that would be built in its place. The new bridge, completed in September 2008, is expected to stand for 100 years. ""That's got to be the safest bridge in America, right?"" joked a Minneapolis resident this week. Alan Phipps, leader of the team that designed the new bridge, chuckles when he hears those kinds of comments. ""I'd say there's a lot of truth to that,"" he said during a phone conversation this week at his Florida office at FIGG Engineering Group.  Builders and designers completed the 10-lane Interstate bridge three months ahead of schedule at a price of $233.8 million. ""It was pretty amazing,"" said Phipps of the marathon project. ""I paid for it with a lot of my hair and so did a lot of other people.""  Although stylish curved piers and a bright white color mark a visual departure from its predecessor, it's what's baked into the bridge that makes it truly unusual. Three-hundred-twenty-three high-technology sensors dot the structure, spitting out a constant stream of data regularly analyzed by engineers at nearby University of Minnesota.   At a total cost of about $1 million including wire connections and power sources, the sensors don't eliminate the need for visual inspections, but they do provide an extra layer of maintenance security.   The sensors monitor corrosion, stress and the movement of the bridge from the constant traffic. ""The fiber-optic strain gauge technology is fairly cutting edge,"" said Phipps. ""A tiny beam of light is used to measure very small differences in the movement of the bridge when vehicles pass over."" Sorry, no flashing red lights or alarms go off when the sensors register something unusual, Phipps said, chuckling. If the fiber-optic sensors show changes in the bridge's movement, data analysts would order a visual inspection, said Phipps, perhaps heading off structural damage that might pose a threat to the people crossing overhead. Less sophisticated strain gauges made of eight-inch pieces of wire measure more specific changes in the bridge's movements. ""It's like going to the doctor's office and having tests done. If something comes up different, then the doctor takes a closer look."" The sensors are wired to a power source and data flows through wires to a nearby computer. The computer is hooked up to fiber-optic cables leading to DOT and University of Minnesota networks. The analytical data can be remotely accessed online on an interface that displays it in tables of numbers, charts and graphs. Another sensor embedded in the bridge looks like a big fork, said Phipps. This one constantly monitors for possible corrosion. Each prong in the fork is embedded at a different depth in the concrete. A power source sends electricity through the sensor. The amount of electricity passing through the sensor indicates the potential for corrosion on the bridge.  Security sensors also have been built into the new bridge to guard against terrorist attacks. Infrared cameras and other technology monitor for unauthorized activity in sensitive areas of the structure, including doors to equipment chambers. National horror stemming from the collapse prompted the U.S. transportation secretary to urge all states to immediately inspect about 750 bridges of the same design nationwide. By law, states must inspect bridges like the one on I-35W every two years. A yearlong investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board blamed the bridge collapse on support plates that were too thin and increased weight on the bridge due to construction equipment. The NTSB recommended nine improvements to state and federal highway officials regarding inspections and how bridge designs are reviewed. If sensors had been installed on the old bridge, would they have provided enough warning to prevent disaster? ""Maybe, maybe not,"" said Phipps. ""This sensor system was designed expressly for this type of bridge. The old bridge would have used a different kind of system, so it's hard to say."" Sensors allow an added layer of security to regularly scheduled visual inspections. ""If the sensor gives off a reading that's ""really crazy, then you could go out to the bridge that day and take a look."" But each bridge owner must weigh the costs and benefits of including high-tech sensor arrays. At about $1 million for the new I-35W's sensors, that's a pretty big decision. A new bridge, said Phipps, is unlikely to fail, because quality control measures are included in construction.   Planners considering expensive sensors may choose to spend the money instead on repairing or maintaining an older bridge so it will last longer. ""The bridges you worry about are the older ones,"" he said.  About 25 percent of all 603,245 U.S. public road bridges are classified as deficient, according to a report announced this month by the Federal Highway Administration.  An immediate ""cost-benefitial"" investment aimed at replacing or repairing deficient bridges might cost nearly $99 billion, according to the Department of Transportation.","3 years after Minneapolis bridge collapse, replacement bridge boasts high-tech safety .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council in New York held an emergency session Thursday to discuss and condemn widespread rapes in eastern Congo, while the U.S. ambassador to the U.N. said she was troubled by a briefing on the attacks. ""We are horrified, and we are outraged, and that led us, in conjunction with the French, to request this detailed briefing this morning,"" said Susan Rice, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., on Thursday. ""It was a disturbing briefing, both for what we learned and what we don't know still."" The United Nations peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo was aware that Rwandan rebels were occupying villages in the region in late July and early August, but did not know of reports that the rebels were raping women in those villages, U.N. officials said this week. Nearly 200 women were gang-raped by hundreds of Rwandan and Congolese rebels, humanitarian officials said. Roger Meece, a representative for U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, said the United Nations was alerted to rebel activity in the area but was not notified of the mass rapes. ""There was no particular question of an attack, much less the kind of events like mass rape,"" Meece said Wednesday. But a senior United Nations official said Thursday that the U.N. was to blame for the incident and that the organization should leave the Congo if it could not protect civilians. ""We are guilty of a conspiracy of silence,"" said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he is a current member of the peacekeeping mission in Congo and is under orders not to criticize the U.N. publicly. ""If we can't help civilians, there is no point in being here."" ""These things happen all the time. It may not be 180, it may be 10, but it happens all the time,"" the official said. ""Our colleagues are part of the problem--it's pretty bad."" ""They take it for granted, that people in Congo just have to suffer,"" the official continued. ""Some of the people in our hierarchy keep saying 'it's not going to change'... They just seem apathetic. It is very rare to meet anyone who wants to make a difference."" The United Nations did not reply to requests for comment on allegations Thursday evening. U.N. officials said that an e-mail warning of rebel activities was sent to U.N. and other staff working in the area. Madnoje Mounoubai, a spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission in eastern Congo -- known by the acronym MONUSCO -- said the U.N. was first alerted to the rapes by humanitarian organizations on August 12. The U.N., which maintains a number of peacekeeping bases in the region, made its first public comments on the attacks Monday. But the account of the delay was disputed by the International Medical Corps, a non-governmental organization that operates in the region.  IMC spokeswoman Margaret Aguirre told CNN that her group informed the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs about the rapes on August 6, a day after IMC representatives had visited the affected villages. Rice said that she and the French ambassador asked many questions about the situation on Thursday. ""I just want to take this opportunity to reiterate from the U.S. point of view our strongest possible condemnation of the rapes and attacks that occurred against scores of innocent civilians,"" she said after the briefing. Vitaly Churkin, of the Russian Federation and this month's Security Council president, said Thursday, ""The members of the Security Council reiterated their demand that all parties with the armed conflict immediately cease completely all forms of sexual violence and all human rights abuses against the civilian population of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, including gender-based violence including rape and other forms of sexual abuse."" According to humanitarian organizations, rebels raided a network of villages in North Kivu province between July 30 and August 3 and raped 179 women. Many of them were gang-raped individually by between two to six men. A U.N. peacekeeper military base was within 30 kilometers (about 19 miles) of the general area of the attacks, in the town of Kibua. ""We had regular patrols in this area during that period,"" Mounoubai told CNN by phone from Kinshasa Wednesday. ""Unfortunately, the villagers and the local authorities never brought this issue to our knowledge. If we are not informed, it will be difficult for us to know,"" he added. Giorgio Trombatore, director for the International Medical Corps in the Congo, said he was among the first group of people to visit the site of the attacks. ""Two hundred to 400 armed men systematically pillaged and raped women in the villages,"" Trombatore said. ""The rebels entered, tried to calm the population down by telling them they came for food and rest, and so [they] shouldn't flee,"" he said. ""Another group came at night and it was then they started harassing the population."" Armed men often raped the women in front of their children and husbands, IMC said in a news release. ""Large numbers of women reported being physically beaten before the sexual assaults, and some reported abuse of babies who were forcibly removed from their arms. The perpetrators simultaneously pillaged the entire village and smaller neighboring villages, before leaving."" During the four-day attack across 16 villages, according to the U.N., rebels from the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda, as well as militiamen from the notorious Mai Mai movement, also looted villages. An earlier report said three peacekeepers were killed and seven others were wounded, but those deaths and injuries stemmed from a previous incident. Ban said Tuesday he was ""outraged"" by the attacks. ""This is another grave example of both the level of sexual violence and the insecurity that continue to plague the DRC,"" Ban said in a statement. He has dispatched a senior representative -- Atul Khare, his assistant secretary-general for peacekeeping operations -- to the affected areas in and around Walikale, the epicenter of the rapes, to meet with victims. Margot Wallstrom, the secretary-general's special representative on sexual violence, was expected to stop in Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, before going on to visit Walikale. Churkin, the Security Council president, said the council welcomed the secretary-general's decision to dispatch a special representative to consult with authorities in Congo. That representative, Churkin said, would dig for facts about the rapes and assess what more could be done to ensure effective protection of civilians. In Washington, State Department Secretary Hillary Clinton said Wednesday she was ""deeply concerned"" by the reports. ""The United States has repeatedly condemned the epidemic of sexual violence in conflict zones around the world, and we will continue to speak out on this issue for those who cannot speak for themselves,"" she said in a statement. ""The United States will do everything we can to work with the U.N. and the DRC government to hold the perpetrators of these acts accountable, and to create a safe environment for women, girls and all civilians living in the eastern Congo."" Ban has called on Congolese authorities to investigate the rapes and bring the perpetrators to justice, and for the government to step up its efforts to ensure civilian security.  Officials with MONUSCO will hold an internal staff meeting between the civilian and military departments Thursday in Goma. The Democratic Republic of the Congo was ranked as the fifth-worst failed state in the world in a 2010 listing created by the Fund for Peace and Foreign Policy Magazine.

"Washington (CNN) -- Several shots have been fired at the National Museum of the Marine Corps building in Virginia, the FBI said Friday. No injuries were reported. It is the second time the Marine Corps museum in Triangle, Virginia, has been fired on in recent days. The Pentagon and a vacant Marine Corps Recruiting Station in Virginia also were shot at recently. All the previous shots came from the same weapon, authorities said. Federal officials said they believe that the person taking the late-night shots at military-related buildings has a grievance against the institution of the Marine Corps but not the men and women serving in the Marines. The officials said at a news conference that they want to talk with the shooter. ""We'd like to know what this grievance is and what we can do to try to resolve it,"" said John Perren, assistant director of the FBI's Washington field office. The latest incident occurred Thursday night, said Gwen Adams, spokeswoman at the National Museum of the Marine Corps. No one was in the building at the time, she said. New bullet holes were found in the glass and metal structure of the building but not inside, Adams said. The new damage was found during a routine inspection, officials said. The bullet holes were on the western side of the building, which faces Interstate 95, the FBI said. The shots probably came from the interstate, said Maj. Mike Crosbie of the Prince William County, Virginia, police department. The museum was closed Friday morning while the investigation continued, Adams said. It will remain closed for the rest of the day, she said. There were no plans Friday to cancel or postpone Sunday's Marine Corps Marathon or any events connected with it, race spokeswoman Tami Faram said. Additional security measures have been taken, however, to bolster an ""already robust plan"" for security at the marathon, Col. Daniel J. Choike, the commander of Marine Corps Base Quantico, said Friday.","NEW: The FBI says the shooter probably has grievance against the Marine Corps .

"(CNN Student News) -- September 14, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • California and Colorado  • Cuba • Vancouver, British Columbia . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: From Cuba and Canada to Hong Kong, we are bringing you headlines from around the world. I'm Carl Azuz. CNN Student News starts right this second! First Up: Congress Returns . AZUZ: First up: Congress is back in session. Members of the Senate and U.S. House of Representatives have about a month to work on legislation, because we're coming up on the midterm elections. Now, we've got a quick reminder for you on those. Voters will cast ballots for all 435 members of the House of Representatives, plus, around a third of the seats in the Senate. Primary elections have been running for months. There are more than a half-dozen of those today. The general election is on November 2nd. Congressmen and women are looking at all sorts of issues, from the economy to food safety and military policies. But some analysts don't think much is gonna happen on any subject, because they think members of Congress don't want to get into controversial debates before the big election. One issue that Congress probably will get into, though, is a set of tax cuts. These were passed under former President George W. Bush. They'll expire if Congress doesn't vote to extend them, meaning taxes would go up. The big debate here is what to do about the tax cuts for America's wealthiest citizens, people who earn more than $250,000 a year. President Obama and most Democrats don't want to continue those cuts. They say America can't afford it, because the government needs the revenue that it would make from the taxes. Most Republicans -- and several Democrats -- do want to extend the tax cuts, though, even if it's just temporarily. They argue that the government shouldn't raise anyone's taxes while the economy is in rough shape. Taxes were on the minds of some Tea Party members over the weekend. They got together for a rally at the U.S. Capitol building and to protest against what they see as out-of-control government spending and too many taxes by the U.S. government. The name of the rally -- ""Remember in November"" -- was a reference to the upcoming midterm elections. Wildfires . AZUZ: Firefighters are battling a pair of blazes in the West. This one you see right now is in Colorado, near the city of Loveland. It started Sunday and spread fast. No reports of any injuries as of yesterday afternoon. Investigators are looking into what started the fire. A local official said he hopes to get a handle on the situation ""very quickly,"" though he added that ""very quickly"" probably means a few days. The other wildfire is out in Southern California. This one broke out on Sunday, too. More than 300 firefighters and emergency personnel are working to get it under control. But the weather is going to play a part in that. If the winds kick up, they can spread the flames. Is This Legit? TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Cuba is a communist country. True! This means that Cuba's government controls the country's economy. Cuba's Economy . AZUZ: We're talking everything from factories and gas stations, to plumbers and ice cream shops. Like a lot of countries, Cuba's economy is struggling, and the government is planning to lay off at least half a million workers over the next six months. The nation's president says that some of those people could find work through private companies, ones that aren't run by the government. Cuba plans to allow more private businesses. Some people think this might be a good thing, because they'd be able to set their own prices or salaries. But, since Cuba controls 90 percent of the country's economy, finding new jobs could be tough. Fruits and Veggies . AZUZ: It's time for your ""no kidding"" headline of the day: Americans aren't eating enough fruits and vegetables. That's according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the CDC. Now, this is interesting: The percentage of American adults who eat enough fruit has actually decreased in the past decade! In 2009, around 32 percent of adults ate fruit at least twice a day. In 2000, it was 34 percent. The government wants that number at 75 percent! For vegetables: About a quarter of American adults ate vegetables at least three times a day. No real change from 2000. The government wants that number at 50 percent. So, why aren't we eating enough? The CDC thinks there are two big reasons: One, it's not as easy for everyone to get fresh fruits and veggies. Two, they're not as cheap as other foods. Illusion of Safety . AZUZ: Here's a question for you to chew over: If you were driving near a school and a young girl ran into the street, what would you do? A YouTube video might help out with the answer. There's the street. There's the girl. And that's what this whole thing is designed to prevent. It's not a real kid. It's a 3D illusion. The group that's behind it says the point is to get drivers to slow down in school zones. They put it out on the first day of school in Vancouver, Canada. Some critics are worried that the image could cause accidents if scared drivers swerve or slam on the brakes. This Day in History .

AZUZ: Earlier today, we talked about how Cuba's economy is struggling. It's not the only one, as all of you know. The U.S. economy, still trying to make its way out of the recession. One of the effects of a down economy is that it can be harder for people to find jobs. Well, harder to find them in America. Pauline Chiou looks at why some Americans are seeking opportunities overseas. (BEGIN VIDEO) ROXANNA BLANCO, AMERICAN: How do we say it? Picture. Good! PAULINE CHIOU, CNN CORRESPONDENT, SEOUL: Roxanna Blanco considers herself lucky to have this job as an English language tutor. Even with a degree in international business and marketing, the American could not find a job for an entire year. Finally, she told her mother she was going to take a bold step. BLANCO: I think I just want to move to China. I think I'm going to go to China. She said, ""Are you crazy? You're gonna go to China?"" ""Yeah, China. That's where I'm going to go."" CHIOU: Roxanna says she sensed the opportunities were in Asia. So last year, she applied online for English teaching jobs in China and got three offers. Roxanna's pull towards Asia is not unusual these days. Hays Recruitment firm says its Asia office has handled a 30% increase in job applicants over the past six months. Most job seekers are from the U.S., UK and Australia. EMMA CHARNOCK, HAYS RECRUITMENT: There's a feeling of frustration that they wanted to kickstart their careers again. They've had a tough 18 months, and simply, the general attitude is they've had enough. CHIOU: Emma Charnock says banks are hiring again and casting a wide net for top talent. But are the salaries the same? CHARNOCK: Good question. We've certainly seen at least a 15% increase on base salaries. CHIOU: While the bulk of the jobs here in Hong Kong are in banking, finance and law, on the mainland, a lot of sectors are hiring. China needs industrial engineers for its high speed rail, also urban planners and architects for stimulus projects. On the mainland, recruiters report an upswing in overseas Chinese returning for jobs. Charnock says she's also noticed an interesting spike in demand for math and science teachers at international schools on the mainland, perhaps as a result of more ex-pats moving to cities like Beijing and Shanghai. Some schools are even offering relocation and housing allowances to attract teachers. BLANCO: Do you wear rainboots? CHIOU: Back in Hong Kong, Roxanna plans to eventually return home to California. But with the U.S. unemployment rate at 9.6%, she's not rushing to buy her plane ticket. BLANCO: Actually, I'm very nervous to go back. We're talking about going back in a year or so, and I still don't know if I'll find work. CHIOU: Until then, it's a waiting game until the time is right. BLANCO: Not ""u,"" not ""o."" ""E.""

"(CNN) -- Barcelona coach Pep Guardiola says a deal to sign Cesc Fabregas may be scuppered by Arsenal's reluctance to sell their captain. Arsenal have already rejected a $45.6 million bid from the Spanish champions and Gunners manager Arsene Wenger has demanded an end to speculation over the transfer. Fabregas, 23, was a product of the Barca youth scheme before leaving to join Arsenal at the age of 16. ""He is a very important player for Arsenal and I understand that he will cost a lot of money,"" Guardiola told reporters on Monday, AFP reported. ""It is Arsenal who are in charge (of this deal) and if Arsenal don't want it, he will not come."" Fabregas has been publicly urged to join Barca by several of his Spain teammates and was embarrassingly forced into wearing the Catalan side's shirt as they celebrated their World Cup triumph in Madrid. But he held talks with Wenger before the World Cup and has not agitated for a move. Barcelona president Sandro Rosell said Friday that Arsenal's determination to keep Fabregas may delay the deal for another season. Barcelona have already completed the big-money purchase of Spain World Cup hero David Villa from Valencia this summer and on Friday sealed the signing of Brazilian utility player Adriano from Sevilla. Arsenal have not won a trophy since 2005, while Barca won the European Champions League in 2009 and the Spanish league the past two seasons.","Guardiola says Arsenal will have final say in whether Fabregas joins Barcelona .

"New York (CNN) -- We all fantasize of one day quitting our jobs in a storm of profanities, middle fingers and toppled computers. Rarely does it happen, though, so when flight attendant Steven Slater lived the dream on JetBlue Flight 1052 at JFK on Monday -- yelling ""it's been great!,"" grabbing a beer and jumping out the emergency slide into airline history -- I sort of had to sit back and applaud. It resonated in the industry, too. ""It was shocking,"" said Sara Keagle, a flight attendant of 18 years who blogs at Flying Pinto and calls the high-strung northeast the trickiest region for smooth passenger-attendant relations. ""He basically lived out a fantasy I didn't know I had."" Tension between airline companies, airline staff and air passengers seems to dip to new lows every year. Passengers whine about an increase of fees on such things as checked baggage, meals and use of blankets (the industry makes nearly $8 billion a year in such fees, says the U.S. Department of Transportation). They also have to surrender harmless toothpaste and disclose sock styles at airport security checks. They get cranky. And flight attendants? They endure long hours (on average about 80 flying hours monthly, Keagle says) and low pay (starting at $14 per hour and topping at about $40). Some can join unions, but at JetBlue, Slater wasn't in a union. All too often, they deal with self-righteous passengers who treat them as assistants, or -- in the case of Slater -- allegedly become abusive. But considering that there are about 50,000 commercial flights daily, our record of getting along peacefully is pretty good. That more flight attendants don't flip out at obnoxious passenger behavior is what's really surprising here. (The worst such behavior I've seen is a drunk trio refusing to stop singing on a flight from Zurich, Switzerland, to Moscow, Russia;  I nearly made it a quartet.) Perhaps more scenarios ought to end like this recent pillow fight on Lufthansa? Still, maybe Slater had a point, if a tad overstated. Perhaps it's time to go over some ground rules.  Here are some tips to keep your flight attendant from going Slater on you. Be nice. The folks in the terminal taking your ticket -- or repelling your delusional pleas for free upgrades -- are frequently those serving you on the flight. So be nice right away. ""Hey, good ticket skills"" is one charmer. Make them laugh.  Before crouching to enter the bathroom, good-naturedly ask ""will I get a hernia in there?"" If they get it, they'll love you; if not, they're sort of lame. Don't talk business. Flight attendants don't need to be reminded their airline is struggling -- and face it, nearly all of them are -- so don't throw out the ol' ""no wonder your airline is on the ropes"" if they're out of cranberry juice. Certainly won't get you a bonus cookie. Take one for the team.  When you get the teacher-scolds-child reminders to put your iPod away, or tuck that fanny pack deeper under the seat in front of you, just do it with a smile or self-deprecating remark like ""gosh, I'm bad at geometry."" Keagle said attendants actually hate having to remind passengers about this. ""I dread that part of the job. Unless you've lived under a rock, you know about that already."" Ask about them.  ""How far have you flown today?"" or ""What's the dumbest passenger question you've heard?"" can show you're interested in them as actual people. Don't dump trash in the seat pouch.  Treat the airline like a friend's home -- don't trash it. The pouch in front of you is not a place to put dirty diapers or your sandwich wrappers. ""I put my hand in puke one time,"" Keagle said. ""Not fun at all."" Don't ogle. Some folks, OK mostly guys, treat the aisle as a walkway of delights and visually grope attendants as they saunter down it. That's rude. Don't defy attendants. C'mon. If an attendant says ""snooze the toilet break,"" snooze it. If you're not yet at the gate, don't get up to sneak a first grab at the overhead storage. The bag will be there. You deserve no bonus privileges above your fellow passengers. To the passenger who reportedly ignited Slater's meltdown?

"(CNN)  -- Bayern Munich came from a goal down to forge a 2-1 victory over Basel in Switzerland on Tuesday in their Champions League Group E clash. Last season's runners-up were beaten by Mainz at the weekend in a setback to their Bundesliga title defense, but showed their mettle in Switzerland to secure a second successive win in the Champions League. Alexander Frei put the home side ahead after 18 minutes with a fine strike before World Cup star Bastian Schweinsteiger netted a second-half penalty to level and then scored the winner from close range in the 89th minute. In the other Group E clash, AS Roma scored their first win of the Champions League campaign with a 2-1 win over Romanian side CFR Cluj at the Stadio Olimpico. Goals from French central defender Philippe Mexes and Italy striker Marco Borriello gave Claudio Ranieiri's men the points despite Ionut Rada's late consolation strike. Cluj had beaten Roma on their home ground in their Champions League debut two years ago but could not repeat the feat. But they are level on three points with the Serie A giants after beating rock- bottom Basel in their group opener. Meanwhile, English champions Chelsea hit back after their league defeat to Manchester City with a 2-0 victory over French champions Marseille at Stamford Bridge. The win left Chelsea on top of Group F after two wins in their latest attempt to bring Europe's top prize to club owner Roman Abramovich. An early goal from John Terry and Nicolas Anelka's first-half penalty sealed the three points ahead of a crunch Premier League clash against Arsenal at the weekend. Chelsea top Spartak Moscow on goal difference after the Russians also made it two wins from two with an earlier 3-0 victory over Slovakia's Zilina. Brazilian striker Ari scored twice while compatriot Ibson added the third for a comfortable victory.","Bayern Munich shrug off poor league form to make it two wins in two in Champions League .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Representatives for North and South Korea agreed that October would be a good time to do another round of reunions for families separated by the Korean war, the South Korean Unification Ministry said Friday. But both sides are still negotiating details such as where the reunion will be. If talks do not go well on where the reunions will be, the event could be canceled. The two sides agreed to hold the reunions on October 21 to 27. They could not agree on how many families to include in the reunion, and where it should be held, the ministry said. The North had proposed resuming the reunions, which traditionally happen around the Koreas' autumn harvest holiday. It falls on September 22 this year. Two Red Cross officials and 14 delegates from South Korea crossed the armed border into North Korea on Friday morning to meet with counterparts, according to the Yonhap news agency. Millions of families were separated by the Korean War, which ended in 1953 with a cease-fire, but no formal peace treaty. About 10,000 people applied to take part in a similar reunion last year, but fewer than 200 families were allowed to participate. Family members wept as they saw one another for the first time in decades. No mail, telephone or e-mail exchanges exist between ordinary citizens across the Korean border. Yoon Ki-Dal, 88, of South Korea thought such a moment would never come. After leaving his son and daughters when they were babies during the Korean War, he was able to hold the hands of his North Korean children last September. ""Father, we thought you were dead,"" his daughter, who was in her 60s, told him, her face trembling. The families were allowed to spend a few days together before the South Koreans had to return home.","NEW: They do not agree on a place or how many families may participate .

"(CNN) -- Argentina battled to victory on Wednesday night in the team's first match since Diego Maradona's reign ended, while new France coach Laurent Blanc suffered defeat after dropping all 23 World Cup players. The South Americans' caretaker coach Sergio Batista fielded eight of the players who started in last month's 4-0 World Cup quarterfinal thrashing by Germany in the friendly away to the Republic of Ireland, and came away with a 1-0 win thanks to Angel Di Maria's first-half winner. The new Real Madrid winger's 20th-minute goal -- which came despite claims of offside -- meant the Irish could not celebrate the first football international at Dublin's new Aviva Stadium, which also marked the 100th appearance by captain Robbie Keane. Ireland coach Giovanni Trapattoni missed the match, with the 71-year-old Italian in hospital after needing stomach surgery following complications from a bout of food poisoning. Blanc fielded eight new internationals against Norway following France's World Cup debacle, but his team lost 2-1 in Oslo despite taking the lead through halftime substitute Hatem Ben Arfa. Forward Erik Huseklepp capitalized on two defensive errors as France's poor run continued, having crashed out of the World Cup in the first round in June following a player revolt against then coach Raymond Domenech. World Cup winners Spain snatched a late draw away to Mexico thanks to David Silva's late equalizer after new Manchester United striker Javier Hernandez had scored in the 12th minute. Runners-up the Netherlands were also held to a 1-1 draw away to Euro 2012 co-hosts Ukraine, with midfielder Jeremain Lens putting the Dutch ahead before Alexander Aliev leveled two minutes later on 74. World Cup semifinalists Germany led Denmark 2-0 before the hosts battled back to earn a 2-2 draw in Copenhagen. The Germans, who finished third in South Africa, went ahead through strikers Mario Gomez (19) and Patrick Helmes (73) but Danish substitute Mads Junker set up winger Dennis Rommedahl and then equalized with four minutes to play. Uruguay, who also reached the last four, won 2-0 away to Angola thanks to goals in the last six minutes from striker Edinson Cavani and young debutant forward Abel Hernandez. New Russia coach Dick Advocaat tasted victory in his first match in charge, beating Bulgaria 1-0 in St. Petersburg thanks to a sixth-minute winner from midfielder Roman Shirokov. South Africa also started a new era on a winning note as coach Pitso Mosimane oversaw a 1-0 victory against World Cup quarterfinalists Ghana in Johannesburg. Striker Katlego Mphela scored the only goal three minutes before halftime, having also netted in the 2-1 win over France in South Africa's final group match of the World Cup on June 22. Earlier in the day, five-time world champions Brazil made a winning start under new coach Mano Menezes, beating the United States 2-0 in New Jersey. Teenage striker Neymar scored on his senior debut and recalled AC Milan forward Alexandre Pato netted the other goal as Menezes gave six players their first Brazil outings. The friendlies were part of a large schedule of internationals held in preparation for next month's start of qualifiers for Euro 2012 and the 2012 African Nations Cup, and January's Asian Cup.","Argentina beat Ireland 1-0 in team's first match since Diego Maradona's reign ended .

"New Orleans, Louisiana (CNN) -- Waiting in a parked car in the Ninth Ward as the rain pounds down, I cannot help but think about the flood in the movie, ""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button."" It's a natural, because I am only a stone's throw from where the levee broke, and I am here to meet the star of that movie, Brad Pitt, as the finale to our ""Building Up America"" tour. The actor targeted this area some years ago with his Make It Right Foundation -- an ambitious plan to build up the shattered neighborhood with new, ecologically friendly, affordable houses, and then fill them with residents who had been driven out by Katrina. When the rain backs off a bit, I hustle into one of the raised houses, where my TV crew is busy setting up lights on a covered upper deck. NBC is also there, but in a different area. I spend a few minutes chatting with Brian Williams. We've known each other for years and share a lot of friends, and it's always nice catching up. After a while, he asks, ""Who's going first on this?"" I respond, ""You are."" He goes to get ready, and I look at the houses arrayed all around us. They are architectural marvels -- striking designs of unexpected angles, bright colors and green innovations: solar panels on the roofs, energy-saving appliances, rainwater collection systems. They don't look like anything else you'll see in the Ninth Ward, but when Pitt finishes with Brian and comes up the stairs, no one is looking at the architecture. ""Hi, Brad."" ""Hi, Tom."" He shakes my hand, flashes that famous smile, and his eyes twinkle (I'm no star chaser, but I swear, they really do). He takes a quick sip from the coffee cup he's carrying as we settle in to talk. ""You have set for yourself a very ambitious project in taking on a very difficult problem,"" I say. ""Five years in, how do you think you're doing?"" ""These houses here have exceeded my expectations,"" he says, looking across the neighborhood. ""The goal here was how do you build affordable housing that's high-performance, and that is going to be strong enough to withstand the kind of weather that we're seeing down here. Things that drive the price up, we've got to get down."" Mindful of how such plans often go, I say, ""I'm guessing your first units here cost a lot more than your later ones."" ""Sure, but now we're down to dollar-for-dollar what it costs to build anything else here,"" Pitt says. When asked how he did that, Pitt replies, ""We had to start over. We thought we could do it better. We thought we could build a house with light and high-performance technology, that we could bring bills down and give the families who live here a better life, and we wanted to prove it at the low income level. ""And now every house you see here, last month, every one but one was producing more energy than it was consuming. That's big news. That's a game-changer. And there is no reason to build any other way now,"" Pitt says. Pitt says he also wants to spread this idea beyond this neighborhood,  looking into other areas in the U.S. and even abroad. Donations from all over the country have fueled the first part of the project. Pitt acknowledges he hasn't made it very far on that next step. ""You know this neighborhood was built on the kindness of strangers,"" he says, quoting ""A Streetcar Named Desire."" ""The old Desire public housing project stood not far from where we are. For this to go on, it has to be on the governmental level. ""They have to look at this and set new practices, and new [building] codes. But in the meantime, with more donations now, we could get into other parts of the city,"" he says. ""These people are pioneers here, and they have built the greenest neighborhood in the world. And I see this as a template that will work in any climate, any condition."" Pitt's love for New Orleans dates back to when he shot ""Interview with the Vampire,"" in the mid-1990s. But his excitement for this project is obvious -- enough so that I wonder if it is taking over as the central interest in his life. We were told repeatedly by Pitt's handlers that he really doesn't like talking about his famous partner, Angelina Jolie, and their children. I wasn't here to ask about his movie career, but oddly enough, as we end our chat, both subjects come up. I look out over the houses he's brought to this troubled part of town and ask, ""Could you see yourself at any point giving up acting to do this?"" He pauses a moment, the way celebrities do when they encounter a question they have not been asked before. ""Um, sure,"" he says hesitantly; then, warming to the idea of giving up the grind of being a movie superstar, ""I'm quite excited by this idea of building a future and the direction that we're going. I'm getting older anyway. I see doing that less and less."" I laugh. ""You'll have to have something to pass your time."" ""Oh, I've got plenty of things to pass my time,"" he says, and in a reference to the famous family brood, adds, ""Six of them.""","Brad Pitt's Make It Right Foundation builds eco-friendly homes in area hit by Katrina .

"(CNN) -- The man trying to prosecute a Brazilian soccer goalie and eight other people on murder charges in the case of a missing woman said Thursday that even though police have not found a body, he will proceed. ""There's no need to find the corpse to prove the death. There are many other ways to prove death. In case the corpse is found, only one proof is needed, which is the autopsy report. But in this case, all other proofs will be united and suppress the need of an autopsy report,"" prosecutor Gustavo Fabrini said. Goalie Bruno Fernandes Das Dores de Souza's new attorney, Ercio Quaresma, said it's ""irresponsible"" to charge the nine suspects with corpse concealment, since no body has been found. ""It's an inconsequence to sign something like that not having concrete proof,"" Quaresma said. The goalie, his lover and his wife were among the nine people charged with the murder of his former girlfriend, who had been trying to prove he had fathered her son. The prosecutor filed the charges against de Souza and eight others in Contagem, Brazil, on Wednesday. Charges include murder, kidnapping, imprisonment, concealment of a corpse, and corruption of a minor. Eliza Samudio, 25, remains missing two months after she was last reported seen. A former policeman, Marcos Aparecido dos Santos, was also charged with murder and concealment of a corpse in the case. Fabrini said Thursday that none of the nine suspects is being accused of conspiracy, contradicting what police had previously said. The other seven suspects were named as Luiz Henrique Ferreira Romao, Fernanda Gomes de Castro, Dayanne Souza, Elenilson Vitor da Silva, Sergio Rosa Sales, Wemerson Marques de Souza and Flavio Caetano de Araujo. All of the suspects are in jail, except for one, who is being sought. Souza's 17-year-old cousin told police the woman was killed. The teen said Souza watched as the missing woman was asphyxiated, mutilated and fed to dogs, local police investigator Wagner Pinto told reporters last month. Quaresma has said his client denies all the accusations and de Souza will not answer any questions for now. ""He has not spoken and he won't speak until the defense decides he needs to speak,"" the lawyer said. ""And that might not happen."" Samudio was trying to prove that the goalie had fathered her infant son, who is currently being cared for by her mother, police said. The football star was last seen with Samudio in June as they headed for his country home in the state of Minas Gerais. The police investigator described her death to reporters last month. ""They tied her hands, and this other individual strangled her,"" Pinto said, referring to Santos. ""Later they de-boned and disemboweled her."" The woman's body was taken to an undisclosed location, where her remains were fed to several Rottweilers, police said. Quaresma decried the accusations. ""Are the Rottweilers being charged, too?"" he asked reporters. Souza's former attorney, Michel Assef Filho, said last month that the goalie has ""no knowledge of the facts. He is astonished and scared by his cousin's testimony and that's it."" Filho stopped representing Souza when the Flamengo Club suspended Souza's contract. The attorney works on behalf of the soccer club. The Flamengo Club said it suspended the goalie's contract until all facts are known. Journalist Luciani Gomes contributed to this report.","NEW: The prosecutor says the lack of a corpse will not hinder prosecution .

"(CNN) -- Actress Mia Farrow testified Monday that supermodel Naomi Campbell named Charles Taylor as the person who presented her with a diamond. Farrow was testifying at the war crimes trial of Taylor, the former president of Liberia who prosecutors allege funded a brutal civil war in Sierra Leone using blood diamonds. A so-called blood diamond is mined in war zones and used to fund rebels and warlords. The stones have fueled bloody conflicts in Africa for more than a decade. Farrow's testimony at the United Nations-backed Special Court for Sierra Leone contradicted that of Campbell, who took the stand last week. During her appearance, Campbell said she didn't know who sent her stones, which were delivered to her room in Pretoria, South Africa late at night. But Farrow told prosecutors: ""She said that in the night she had been awakened. Some men were knocking at her door. They were sent by Charles Taylor and they had given her a huge diamond."" Both Farrow and Campbell were guests at a dinner hosted by Nelson Mandela in 1997, which Taylor also attended. The next morning, Campbell told the tribunal, she shared the story of receiving stones with her then-agent, Carole White, and Farrow. ""Well, that's obviously Charles Taylor,"" one of them said. Campbell didn't recall who said it. Then, one of them added, ""Well, obviously, they are diamonds."" Campbell said she assumed the stones came from Taylor, but testified that she wasn't sure. After her testimony, prosecutors said they would present two witnesses who would dispute Campbell's story. ""Two other witnesses will also testify about these events.... there are significant differences between those accounts and Ms. Campbell's account,"" the prosecution said in a statement. Farrow's testimony did just that. Taylor, 62, was president of Liberia from 1997 to 2003. The war crimes charges against him stem from the widespread murder, rape and mutilation that occurred during the civil war in Sierra Leone, fought largely by teenagers who were forced to kill, given addictive drugs to provoke violent behavior and were often instructed to rape and plunder. Taylor is charged with five counts of crimes against humanity, including murder, enslavement and sexual slavery and violence. He also faces five counts of war crimes, including acts of terrorism and torture, and one count of other serious violations of international humanitarian law. He has pleaded not guilty. Prosecutors had rested their case against Taylor in February 2009 but reopened it to call Campbell to testify after learning in June of that year that Taylor had given the supermodel a diamond. When arguing to reopen the case, prosecutors said Campbell's testimony would prove that the former president ""used rough diamonds for personal enrichment and arms purchases,"" according to papers filed with the U.N.-backed court. Taylor has testified that he never handled the precious stones.","Mia Farrow says Naomi Campbell said Charles Taylor sent her a diamond .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- A Thai appeals court ruled Friday that suspected international arms dealer Viktor Bout can be extradited to the United States. The court ruled that the extradition process must be completed within three months, otherwise Bout will be released. Bout, a former Soviet military officer, was shackled in chains during the hearing. His wife and daughter were also in the courtroom. After the ruling, they stood up and cried. Friday's ruling came after heavy lobbying from U.S. officials. ""We are extremely pleased that the Appeals Court in Thailand has granted the extradition of Viktor Bout to the United States on charges of conspiring to sell weapons to a terrorist organization for use in killing Americans,"" said a statement by acting U.S. Deputy Attorney General Gary Grindler. ""We have always felt that the facts of the case, the relevant Thai law and the terms of our bilateral extradition treaty clearly supported the extradition of Mr. Bout on these charges."" Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov described the Thai appeals court's ruling as an ""unlawful, political decision"" that was ""taken under a very strong pressure from the outside,"" Russian state-run news agency RIA Novosti reported. ""I can assure you that we'll do everything necessary for his return to his home country,"" Lavrov told reporters, according to RIA Novosti. Bout had been indicted by U.S. federal authorities on a series of charges, including counts of illegally purchasing U.S. cargo planes to ferry weapons to warring parties and regimes in Africa and the Middle East. Thai courts had previously balked at extraditing Bout to the United States on the basis of the original charges against him, which centered on his alleged efforts to send millions of dollars worth of weapons to arm guerrilla fighters in Colombia. Last year, a Thai court rejected the U.S. government's request for extradition. Bout was arrested in Bangkok in March 2008 after a sting operation led by agents of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency, posing as members of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC). Bout, widely regarded as a prolific arms dealer, has been in Thai custody since. Bout has repeatedly said he has not broken any laws and the allegations against him are lies. He is accused of supplying weapons to war zones around the world -- from Sierra Leone to Afghanistan. In February, a federal indictment charged Bout and an alleged co-conspirator with the illegal purchase of a Boeing 727 and a Boeing 737, money laundering and wire fraud. The United States charged Bout in 2008 with agreeing to sell surface-to-air missiles, armor-piercing rocket launchers, ""ultralight"" airplanes, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other weapons to FARC. Justice Department officials have sought his extradition since then. Federal authorities accused Bout of four terrorism offenses: conspiracy to kill U.S. nationals, conspiracy to kill U.S. officers or employees, conspiracy to acquire and use an anti-aircraft missile, and conspiracy to provide material support or resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, the designation given to FARC by the U.S. State Department. A former Soviet air force officer who speaks six languages, Bout allegedly began building his arms business as the Soviet Union disintegrated in the early 1990s. He acquired surplus Soviet planes and, according to the U.S. Treasury Department, started shipping arms and ammunition to various conflict zones. It is widely believed that he inspired the character of Yuri Orlov, the arms dealer played by Nicolas Cage in the 2005 film ""Lord of War.""

"(CNN) -- Beginning Thursday, the head of the National Black Farmers Association will ride a tractor to Capitol Hill to press Congress to fund a historic discrimination case settlement involving minority farmers. John Boyd says he will make the ride on the tractor he named ""Justice"" each day the Senate is in session. Last week, he showed up in front of a federal courthouse in New York on a mule -- a reference to Civil War-era promises of assistance for freed African-American slaves. ""I'm sorry my tractor may slow things down, but any delay in traffic is small potatoes compared to the years of delay black farmers have endured in our pursuit of justice,"" he said. Last month, the U.S. Senate failed to approve $1.25 billion for the settlement between the U.S. Agriculture Department and black farmers, prompting finger-pointing between both parties and outrage among the farmers. ""Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have both told me personally, on multiple occasions, that they support resolving and funding this case,"" Boyd said. ""Justice in this case should know no partisan boundaries."" Boyd has said black farmers are losing land at a rate three times faster than other agricultural workers. He said that it takes nearly 400 days to process a black farmer's loan request at the Agriculture Department, compared with less than 30 days for white farmers. A 1997 case against the Agriculture Department, Pigford v. Glickman, was settled out of court 11 years ago, but tens of thousands of farmers missed the filing deadline to submit claims. As a senator, Obama sponsored a measure in the 2008 Farm Bill that reopened the case, known as Pigford II. The $1.25 billion settlement is owed to the farmers after years of being denied government farm loans and support from federal programs because of the color of their skin. Under a federal judge's terms dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. In February, the Department of Justice released a statement saying Attorney General Eric Holder and Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack were announcing a resolution to Pigford II. The statement said the settlement agreement is contingent on the appropriation of funds by Congress. Prominent members of both parties have voiced support for paying out the settlements. In July, the House approved a war supplemental funding bill that included money to pay for the settlement. But the attempt to approve the funds in August failed in the Senate. It was the seventh attempt by the Senate to approve the funds, Boyd said. CNN's Shawna Shepherd, Alan Silverleib, Elise Zeiger and Ed Hornick contributed to this report.","The settlement involves the U.S. Agriculture Department .

"GENEVA, Switzerland (Reuters)  -- Extreme sexual violence against women is pervasive in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and local authorities do little to stop it or prosecute those responsible, a U.N. investigator said on Monday. A woman struggles to describe her rape by military members. Health workers call rape an epidemic. Rape and brutality against women and girls are ""rampant and committed by non-state armed groups, the Armed Forces of the DRC, the National Congolese Police, and increasingly also by civilians"", said Turkish lawyer Yakin Erturk. ""Violence against women seems to be perceived by large sectors of society to be normal,"" she added in a report after an 11-day trip to the strife-torn country. Erturk, special rapporteur for the United Nations Human Rights Council on violence against women, said the situation in South Kivu province, where rebels from neighboring Rwanda operate, was the worst she had ever encountered. The atrocities perpetrated there by armed groups, some of whom seemed to have been involved in the 1994 Rwandan massacres in which 800,000 people were killed, ""are of an unimaginable brutality that goes far beyond rape,"" she said. ""Women are gang-raped, often in front of their families and communities. In numerous cases, male relatives are forced at gun point to rape their own daughters, mothers or sisters,"" she said. After rape, many women were shot or stabbed in the genital area, and survivors told Erturk that while held as slaves by the gangs they had been forced to eat excrement or the flesh of their murdered relatives. Women who have been raped are systematically rejected by their families and society. Widespread sexual abuse in the various conflicts racking the republic -- which last year held elections hailed as marking a new era -- ""seems to have become a generalized aspect of the overall oppression of women,"" Erturk said. Her report followed charges from U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Louise Arbour last week that soldiers and police used excessive force, including summary executions, in quelling opposition protesters in the west of the DRC earlier this year. In the central Equateur province, the police and army often responded to civil unrest ""with organized armed reprisals that target the civilian population and involve indiscriminate pillage, torture and mass rape"", the report found. Although the DRC parliament outlawed sexual violence in July 2006, ""little action is taken by the authorities to implement the law and perpetrators continue to enjoy immunity, especially if they wear the state's uniform,"" Erturk said. Erturk said Congo's justice system was corrupt and in ""a deplorable state,"" while conditions in prisons were ""scandalous"". Senior army and police officers shielded their men from prosecution, and when some were arrested they escaped easily, probably ""with the complicity of those in charge."" In a few cases courts had ordered the state and individuals to compensate victims. But ""to this day the government has not paid reparations to a single victim who has suffered sexual violence at the hand of state agents,"" said  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 Reuters.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) -- Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan officially declared Saturday that he will run in the 2011 elections, lauding his achievements in reforming the oil, banking and electricity sectors. ""I have decided to humbly offer myself as a candidate in the presidential primaries of our party the great PDP (People's Democratic Party),"" he said. Jonathan's official declaration comes three days after he informally announced on Facebook that he intended to run in the primaries, which will be held between October 18 and 20, according PDP spokesman Rufai Alkali. ""In presenting myself for service, I make no pretense that I have a magic wand that will solve all of Nigeria's problems or that I am the most intelligent Nigerian,"" Jonathan wrote on his Facebook page Wednesday. He took a more confident stance Saturday, announcing that under his presidency, all petrol refineries are now working, the banking sector has been reformed, electricity has been stablized and steps have been taken to fix roads, water, education and food production. He also said he has set in progress free and fair elections. Jonathan's eligibility was in question until last month, when the People's Democratic Party said he could run in an open race with other candidates next year. Under Nigerian ""zoning"" rules, power must shift to different regions and ethnic groups every eight years. Jonathan -- who is from the Niger Delta, in the south -- was part of the joint ticket of the late President Umaru Yar'Adua, who was from the north. Yar'Adua's death in May, after a long illness, upset the order of the zoning. Yar'Adua was elected in 2007 and his southern replacement threatened to halt the north's turn at holding power. On Friday, four main contenders from the north announced they will put forth a single candidate to challenge Jonathan. CNN's Christian Purefoy contributed to this report.","President Goodluck Jonathan will run in next month's primaries .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday denied a stay of execution appeal from Teresa Lewis, scheduled to be the first woman executed in the United States in five years. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell previously rejected a clemency request from the death row inmate, who is set to die by injection Thursday evening. Lewis, a 41-year-old grandmother, pleaded guilty to her part in the 2002 slayings of her husband and stepson in their rural home near Danville, Virginia, about 145 miles from Richmond. Two male co-conspirators -- the triggermen -- were given life in prison without parole. McDonnell last week refused to issue a stay for Lewis, who is the first woman scheduled to be executed in Virginia in nearly a century. ""Having carefully reviewed the petition for clemency, the judicial opinions in this case, and other relevant materials, I find no compelling reason to set aside the sentence that was imposed by the Circuit Court and affirmed by all reviewing courts,"" the governor wrote. ""Accordingly, I decline to intervene and have notified the appropriate counsel and family of my decision."" Lewis and her lawyers had formally asked the governor to spare her life, arguing she has an IQ that is borderline mentally retarded and that she was manipulated to commit the crimes by a dominant male co-defendant. She pleaded guilty to her participation in the murders, but now regrets her actions. ""I just want the governor to know that I am so sorry, deeply from my heart,"" she recently told CNN. ""And if I could take it back, I would, in a minute... I just wish I could take it back. And I'm sorry for all the people that I've hurt in the process."" Lewis had admitted to police she concocted the plot to kill her husband, Julian Lewis, and his son, C.J. Lewis, an Army reservist set to be deployed to Iraq. At the time, she was having an affair with Matthew Shallenberger and paid him and then-19-year-old Rodney Fuller to commit murder for the victims' insurance money. Court records show Lewis gave the two killers cash to buy weapons and left the door of the rural home open for easy entry. Teresa was in bed with her husband when he was blasted with a shotgun by Shallenberger. Julian Lewis survived long enough to tell police: ""My wife knows who did this to me."" C.J. Lewis was killed by Fuller in his bedroom down the hall. Despite her guilty plea, a state judge later sentenced Lewis to death while sparing the lives of triggermen Shallenberger and Fuller. The judge at sentencing called her ""the head of this serpent."" The state argued Lewis was the mastermind of the murders-for-hire, and officials say she does not deserve mercy. ""I can frankly say that Teresa Lewis is as evil a person as I've ever met,"" said David Grimes, commonwealth's attorney for Pittsylvania County, who was at the scene of the crimes shortly after they occurred. ""I would wager with some assurance that you wouldn't find anyone who knew her before this event occurred who thought she was mentally retarded, or had a limited mentality -- that it would ever cross their minds."" Her supporters say Lewis is deeply remorseful and has been a model prisoner, helping fellow female inmates cope with their circumstances. ""I do feel I could be a lot of help to some of the women -- which I have already. From my understanding I've already helped a lot, to change their lives, or made them look at their lives in a different way,"" she told CNN. Amnesty International and best-selling author John Grisham are among those supporting leniency. Grimes said Lewis has a ""fairly low"" IQ but noted courts have concluded she is not mentally retarded. The state also argued Lewis waited 45 minutes after the shootings before calling police and that she had involved her then-16-year-old daughter in the plot. Defense lawyer Jim Rocap argued that such evidence suggested ""Teresa could not have been the mastermind."" ""Shallenberger has stated, and the experts that have examined her agree, that she was being used by Shallenberger, not the other way around,"" he said. Lewis' attorneys say that Shallenberger admitted he used Lewis to get at the $250,000 she would receive in the event her stepson died. A letter from Shallenberger to another woman, they say, said that the only reason he slept with Lewis was ""so she would give me the insurance money."" ""She was exactly what I was looking for,"" he wrote. ""Some ugly bitch who married her husband for the money and I knew I could get to fall head over heels for me."" Furthermore, they said, Shallenberger said he ""manipulated the whole thing"" and ""knew he was going 'take' Lewis from the moment he met her,"" according to an affidavit from one of their investigators. But Shallenberger, who committed suicide in 2006, refused to sign the affidavit and actually tore up and ate part of it. Still, Grimes said, his investigation showed that Lewis took an active role in the plot, that she connived and manipulated everyone from her late husband to her lover to her children. From early on, he said, Lewis schemed several different ways to get the inheritance money. She helped plan an earlier plot to kill her husband that failed.

"(CNN) -- New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady was involved in a two-vehicle accident Thursday morning near his home in Boston, Massachusetts, but is now ""fine,"" according to a source familiar with the incident. Brady was not injured and was already at football practice after the wreck, the source said. The driver of the other vehicle was hospitalized, but the condition of that person was not immediately clear, the source said. Law enforcement sources told the Boston Globe that Brady was driving a sedan and was treated at the scene. The driver of the other vehicle, a passenger van, was transported to a local hospital, the Globe reported.

"Moscow, Russia (CNN) -- As Russia reels from the worst drought in nearly 40 years, Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has announced a temporary ban on grain exports. ""I think it is expedient to temporarily ban exports of grain and grain products from Russia,"" Putin said in a government meeting Thursday. Putin spokesman Dmitry Pskov confirmed to CNN that the ban would be from August 15 through December 1. Russia is the world's third largest wheat exporter, but is facing the possibility of wheat shortages. The drought has forced the country's Agriculture Ministry to slash its grain forecast from 90 million tons to between 70 and 75 million tons. Grain prices have been rising everywhere recently, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's Wheat Year in Review Report for 2008-2009, the most recent available. Because adverse weather lowered wheat production in 2007-2008, there was a global price spike that year, the report states. Many wheat-producing countries harvested large amounts of wheat in 2008, taking advantage of the record-high prices and good weather. After a sharp drop in monthly prices in October 2008, wheat prices continued rising. The all-wheat season average hit a record-high of $6.78 per bushel in the United States in 2009. The world set a record at 25.1 billion bushels of wheat produced that year. ""U.S. and world wheat prices soared,"" the report states. Eventually, the demand for U.S. wheat began exceeding the supply, further contributing to high costs. CNN's Emily Evans contributed to this report.","The Russian government has banned grain exports until December 1 .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- The 33 workers trapped in a Chilean mine got a rare treat Tuesday night:  they got to watch their national soccer team compete against Ukraine via a small projector wired down to their safety chamber on a fiber optic cable. Chile lost, 2-1. But it was a diversion, nonetheless, as the miners try to distract themselves while rescue crews continue drilling down to save them on Day 34 of their ordeal. Ximena Matas, a spokeswoman for the Chilean minerals ministry, told reporters Wednesday that the drill being used in what's called rescue Plan A has driven through 28 more meters (about 31 yards) of earth since Tuesday for a total distance of 141 meters (154 yards).  The Plan B drill plunged 145 meters (158 yards) more, to reach a total of 268 meters (293 yards), she said, and equipment for the Plan C drill will begin arriving Wednesday evening. Plan A could take up to four months to reach the men, officials have said.  The Plan B operation could get to them in two months,  while the Plan C option -- which could turn out to be the fastest -- may not be ready to put into action until late September, authorities have said. The workers are trapped at a depth of 2,300 feet inside of a chamber in the mine.  When rescuers first found them, the men told officials they had survived for more than 17 days by sharing a jar of peaches and small amounts of tuna and mackerel that were in their shelter. By last week, their meals included bread with ham and turkey, wine cookies, stroganoff with pasta primavera, peaches in juice, nutritional supplements, bread with caramel spread, chicken in sauce and plantains. A team of experts from NASA held meetings with Chilean officials Tuesday to discuss the miners' eventual extraction and their lives beyond that. Dr. Michael Duncan, the deputy chief medical officer at Johnson Space Center, said the Chileans viewed the extraction of the miners as the end of the rescue operations. The Americans suggested that given the delicate recovery and re-integration of the miners, the actual rescue was just but a step in a longer process. For example, there is their re-introduction to their families and society, and the pressures they will feel from others and the media, he said.  They will have to cope with a certain level of celebrity status for having survived in the mine, he added. NASA psychologist Al Holland, who was also a member of the U.S. delegation, said that the miners were in great spirits.  The fact that they had organized themselves into groups and established a hierarchy among themselves before being found in the mine was good for their mental well-being, he said. Holland said he shared with the Chileans ideas about the importance of sleep and wake cycles and creating a systematic way of positioning lighting to that end. Chilean Health Minister Jaime Manalich told CNN the miners have been assigned tasks underground.  The men have been divided into teams to manage the tubes that carry the supplies that are their lifeblood. One miner is in charge of setting the schedule of when they eat and sleep, another of nutritional matters and another of medical needs, he said. CNN's Patrick Oppmann in Copiapo contributed to this report.","The miners were able to watch a soccer match live via a projector .

"(CNN) -- With the departure of the last U.S. combat brigade from Iraq, the Obama administration has taken a large stride toward its goal of complete American military withdrawal from Iraq by the end of next year. And there are many other signs of progress. The rate of Iraqi civilian deaths in political violence has fallen by 90 percent from its awful peak in 2006, before ""the surge"" in American forces and strategy began to roll back the insurgent challenge. American military deaths in Iraq have fallen to 46 so far this year, by far the lowest level since the American invasion in March 2003, and again a 90 percent decline from the pace of casualties in 2007.  In March of this year, Iraq held the most democratic election any Arab country has held in a generation (with the possible exception of Lebanon). Unfortunately, however, the new milestone in U.S. military disengagement from Iraq comes at a moment when the country is starting to slip backward on both the political and security fronts. Since the March 7 parliamentary election results were announced, the country's major political alliances have remained hopelessly deadlocked on the formation of a new coalition government.  Despite months of negotiations and repeated imploring from high-level U.S. government officials, Iraq's major leaders and parties remain unable to agree on who should be prime minister or how power should be shared. As Iraq staggers on essentially without a government, electricity and other services remain sporadic, economic reconstruction is delayed and terrorist violence is once again filling the breach.  In the deadliest single incident in months, at least 48 people died and more than 140 were injured on Tuesday when a suicide bomber struck outside an army recruiting center in downtown Baghdad. As the American troops withdraw, Iraq is also losing top government officials, judges and police officers to a rising pace of targeted assassinations.  All of this has the familiar signature of al Qaeda in Iraq, although it is difficult to attribute responsibility among the shadowy web of insurgent groups. Complicating the political impasse are deep continuing divisions along sectarian lines.  Iraq's Sunni Arab minority -- which ruled under Saddam Hussein but was marginalized in the wake of his downfall -- bet heavily on the electoral process this time, in marked contrast to the first parliamentary election in 2005. But the Sunni Arabs were the main group affected when more than 400 parliamentary candidates were disqualified earlier this year for alleged Baathist ties.  Now they feel doubly aggrieved in that the political alliance they overwhelmingly supported in March -- former Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's al-Iraqiya list -- is being blocked from leading the new government, even though it finished a narrow first in the voting. The obstacle to a political solution in Baghdad is not only the pair of Shiite-dominated political lists (including that of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who finished second in the vote), but, it is widely believed, the Islamic Republic of Iran, which cannot abide an Iraqi prime minister over whom it does not exercise substantial leverage.  Indeed, the only two interests that benefit from Iraq's drift are al Qaeda in Iraq and the hardliners in Iran. President Obama deserves more than a little sympathy as he confronts this thorny situation.  Although he opposed the war in Iraq, he essentially accepted the Bush administration's measured timetable for American military drawdown.   Particularly at a time when the budget deficit is soaring and the war in Afghanistan demands more military and financial resources, Obama and most other Americans would like to be out of Iraq completely by yesterday. But accelerating or even completing the timetable for American military withdrawal in Iraq may only compound the gathering crisis there, for two reasons. First, as the recent spike in violence is meant to suggest, it is not yet clear that Iraq's security forces are even close to being able to handle the country's security on their own.  Privately, most Iraqi political actors (Sunni, Shia and Kurd) would like to see some sort of continued American military presence well beyond 2011.  Many worry not only about Iraq's internal security but also about growing Iranian dominance once the United States is completely gone. And second, U.S. political influence declines markedly as the American military presence phases out. The worst thing the United States could do at the moment is to take Iraq for granted. The Obama administration has had the right instinct in trying to press for and facilitate a political breakthrough in Baghdad, but more needs to be done and soon, while the United States still retains significant leverage. The situation may now require the designation of a high-level American official or envoy to devote sustained attention to the stalemate in Iraq, while working closely with high-level representatives from the United Nations and the European Union.  Such combined diplomatic leverage and mediation broke a dangerous political stalemate in Iraq in 2005 and might help again. One thing should be clear.  No matter what one may think of the original decision to invade Iraq (which I still believe was a mistake), Iraq has come too far and the United States has paid too dearly to now stand by and watch it sink back needlessly into chaos. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Larry Diamond.","Larry Diamond says there are signs of progress in Iraq .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- Attorneys representing Arizona and the U.S. Justice Department faced off Monday in an appeals court hearing over the state's controversial new immigration law. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer has asked the 9th Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals to overturn a federal judge's July ruling, which blocked the most contested parts of the law the day before it was scheduled to go into effect. In response to the Justice Department's suit over the law, U.S. District Judge Susan Bolton's July ruling temporarily blocked such controversial provisions as the requirement that police officers check a person's immigration status while enforcing other laws. Critics have argued that the law, known as SB 1070, would lead to racial profiling. Brewer and other Arizona officials have said the law is necessary to make up for federal government failures in enforcing immigration laws. An attorney for the Justice Department told the court that the Arizona law is ""an extraordinary state statute that exacts penalties on top of federal ones enacted by Congress."" ""If every state did this, we would have a patchwork of laws"" on immigration, Justice Department lawyer Edwin Kneedler said. But John Bouma, the attorney for Arizona, told the three-judge panel that the law's provisions ""are consistent with congressional objectives."" ""It's objectives that count rather than this administration's priority,"" Bouma said, referring to the Obama White House. ""Arizona has 15,000 well-trained and capable officers on the ground who can help the fix the system."" Bouma asked the court to lift the injunction so that Arizona can ""get on with taking care of the health, safety and welfare of citizens."" The judges adjourned after hearing the arguments. Each side had 30 minutes to present arguments before the panel of three judges at Monday's hour-long hearing, which started at 9 a.m. Brewer said that the case is about what states ""can do about a failed federal immigration system that even President Obama acknowledges is broken."" ""Arizona is on the front line in a fight against crime that is spilling over the international border,"" Brewer said in a written statement. ""As noted in the court record, the federal government has essentially had to cede a vast territory inside the state of Arizona to the drug runners and human smugglers."" Activists on both sides have weighed in on the case. Republican lawmakers, Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio and other state governments are among those filing briefs with the appeals court supporting Arizona's argument. The Mexican government, the Anti-Defamation League, the American Immigration Lawyers Association and the city of Tucson, Arizona, are among those filing briefs supporting the Justice Department's side. Some parts of the Arizona law took effect in July, including a ban on ""sanctuary cities"": municipalities with laws or policies that render them relatively safe for undocumented immigrants. Bolton's July ruling also allowed a provision in the law that makes it illegal to hire day laborers if doing so impedes traffic. In addition, the ruling allowed parts of the law dealing with sanctions for employers who hire illegal immigrants. But the ruling blocked a provision requiring alien registration papers. The stay also suspended a provision making it a crime ""for an unauthorized alien to solicit, apply for, or perform work"" and another provision ""authorizing the warrantless arrest of a person"" when there's a reason to believe that person might be subject to deportation. Even after Monday's hearing, analysts say, legal wrangling over Arizona's law is likely to continue. As other states pass similar laws, the issue is ""very much destined for the Supreme Court,"" CNN senior legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin said in July. State Sen. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the law, has said he foresaw a protracted legal battle from the beginning. ""I wrote this bill for that fistfight, prepared for that fistfight,"" he said. ""We'll prevail in the fistfight, because it's states' rights."" CNN's Dan Simon contributed to this report.","Justice Department attorney calls Arizona law ""extraordinary""

"(CNN) -- It's a country where wealth is measured by happiness, plastic bags and tobacco are forbidden, and national dress is compulsory.  The enigmatic kingdom of Bhutan is famous for its anonymity and traditional way of life. Nestled high in the Himalayan Mountains, a buffer between India and China, the country has for centuries been all but cut off from the rest of the world. Now, as change sweeps through many of its neighboring countries, Bhutan remains stubbornly rooted to its ancient traditions -- fiercely protective of its cultural heritage and pristine wilderness. With tourism restricted -- visitors have to pay a flat fee of up to $200 per day to stay in the country, regardless of where they're staying -- many of Bhutan's ancient wonders remain undiscovered to the outside world.  Below is a look at some of the more fascinating and little-known sites the country has to offer. The Tiger's Nest Monastery (Taktsan Monastery), Paro . Precariously perched on the side of a mountain, the 17th-century Tiger's Nest Monastery is one of the holiest and most visually stunning sites in Bhutan. Located 600 meters above Paro valley (a three-hour hike), the monastery was built on the site where Bhutan's founder of Buddhism, Guru Rinpoche, is said to have flown on the back of a tigress in order to meditate. Punakha Dzong, Punakha . One of the most beautiful dzongs -- or fortresses -- in the country, Punakha is located on the confluence of the Pho Chu and Mo Chu rivers. Built in 1637, it served as Bhutan's seat of government until the mid-20th century.  Ravaged by time and natural disasters throughout the centuries -- including floods, fires and earthquakes -- Punakha Dzong has recently been returned to its former glory using only traditional methods and materials. As well as an administrative center for the district, the Dzong is home to the five-day spring Punakha Tsechu festival.  Chorten Kora, Trashi Yangtse . Taking 12 years to build, the stunning white-washed Chorten Kora was built in 1740 to vanquish a demon said to be living on the site. With eyes painted on all four of its sides to ward off evil, the chorten sits majestically in the Karmaling Valley of Eastern Bhutan. One of the earliest forms of Buddhist architecture, chortens have been built for centuries in order to house the relics and mystical objects of Buddhist saints. At Chorten Kora, legend has it an eight-year-old girl from neighboring India asked to be buried alive in the stone monument in order to pray and mediate during the chorten's construction. Druk Wangyal Chorten & Dochula Chorten, Dochula . With stunning views of the Himalayan peaks, a cluster of 108 chortens sit atop the 3,100-meter-high Dochula Pass. A relatively new site, the Druk Wangyal Chortens were commissioned by Bhutan's queen mother in 2004 and provide an impressive backdrop to the fourteenth-century Dochula Chorten in front. The centuries-old chorten was said to be built to subdue a demon disturbing people traveling through the popular Dochula Pass, which connects the country's capital of Thimphu to the east of Bhutan. Trongsa Dzong, Trongsa . Holding a special place in the heart of the Bhutanese, Trongsa Dzong is the largest fortress in the country and since 1907 has been the seat for the Kings of Bhutan. Built on a mountain above the Mandge Chu gorge, for centuries the dzong controlled the trade routes from east and west Bhutan, with the Ta Dzong watchtower, now a museum, built to guard the dzong from enemies.

"(CNN) -- Pro Football Hall of Famer George Blanda, who racked up more than 2,000 points in a record 26-year career, has died at age 83, the Oakland Raiders announced Monday. A quarterback who doubled as a placekicker, Blanda retired in 1975 at age 48. During stints with the Raiders, the Chicago Bears, Baltimore Colts and the Houston Oilers, he scored a then-record 2,002 points, including 236 touchdown passes. Blanda died after a brief illness, the Pro Football Hall of Fame announced. Blanda was the NFL Player of the Year in 1970, the season that a string of last-minute touchdown passes or field goals led to a string of Raiders wins and one tie in five straight games. Raiders owner Al Davis, a personal friend, once called him ""the greatest clutch player the game of pro football has ever known."" ""Our heart goes out to his wife Betty and the Blanda family, and we grieve with them for our great friend,"" the team said.","Blanda spent 26 seasons in pro football .

"(CNN) -- Cristiano Ronaldo has warned holders Manchester United that Champions League quarterfinal opponents Porto will be no pushovers, ahead of Tuesday's first leg clash at Old Trafford. Ronaldo is confident holders United will see off Porto's challenge of two legs and reach the semis. ""Porto are a very good team,"" said Portugal's World Player of the Year. ""They are top of the league back home, ahead of Sporting Lisbon and Benfica and we know how strong they can be."" But Ronaldo, who scored twice in the dramatic 3-2 win over Aston Villa that sent United back to the top of the Premier League, is confident enough to predict that United will reach the last four . ""The good thing is we have two games against them and I feel that will be enough to get us through,"" he said. United are odds-on favorites to reach a third successive semifinal, but manager Alex Ferguson also respects a side that finished above Arsenal in the group phase and defeated highly-rated Atletico Madrid on away goals in the last round. ""It would be stupid to think this is going to be easy,"" said Ferguson. ""When teams are used to winning their domestic title, as Porto are in Portugal, you always feel they will play with great confidence. ""They have a lot of South Americans in their team as well, which gives them a great physical strength. ""By beating Atletico Madrid, Porto proved they will be hard to beat. Complacency does not come into it as far as we are concerned. We will be going at full throttle in order to get the result we want."" Brazil forward Hulk, man-of-the-match as Porto extended their unbeaten league run to 16 games at the weekend, provides a physical threat with strike partner Lisandro Lopez equally capable of causing United damage. Ferguson feels the last-gasp win over Villa can kick-start their push for glory after it had appeared United's mini-slump was about to turn into a full-blown crisis. They were trailing 2-1 when Ronaldo equalised. Then, in the second minute of stoppage time, debutant Federico Macheda curled home a magnificent winner to send United into ecstasy. ""The winner was one of those incredible moments you probably only get at this club and it could well galvanise the club,"" said Ferguson who keeps the 17-year-old in his squad against Porto. United will be bolstered by the return of Wayne Rooney, Nemanja Vidic and Paul Scholes from suspension, but Rio Ferdinand is still sidelined by a groin injury.","Cristiano Ronaldo warns Champions League rivals Porto will be no pushovers .

"Havana, Cuba (CNN) -- Cuban dissident Guillermo Farinas said Thursday he ended his months-long hunger strike after the nation's Roman Catholic Church announced Wednesday that the Cuban government will soon release 52 political prisoners. ""What we want more than anything is to see our political prisoners of conscience freed -- as much abroad as in Cuba,"" he told CNN en Espanol in an interview from a hospital in Santa Clara, Cuba, where he was being treated for complications associated with his fast. Farinas said his departure from the hospital would depend ""on how things evolve."" He said his medical team was ""very worried"" about two blood clots, one in his neck and the other in his chest. If either were to break free, ""I could die quickly,"" he said. ""At least, if we die, we know that our brothers are going to live in liberty,"" he added. Farinas said the planned prisoner release may serve the Cuban government in two ways -- by pressuring the United States to lift its trade embargo on the island, and by buying the island's leaders more time in power. ""If they don't take these measures, they're going to lose control of the country,"" he said. ""What they want is to die in power. Therefore, they're trying to do some political pirouettes to hold on to power."" Farina's doctor and fellow dissident, Ismeli Iglesias Martinez, said his patient was drinking water. But Farinas remains frail, unable to eat solid foods, Iglesias said. The 48-year-old psychologist and writer stopped eating in February to protest the Cuban government's imprisonment of political activists. Cuba's Roman Catholic Church has announced the names of five political prisoners set to be freed. All five will leave Cuba for Spain in the next few days, the church said in written statement Thursday. In addition, the church said, six jailed dissidents will be moved to prisons closer to their homes. Church officials had announced Wednesday that a total of 52 political prisoners were set to be freed and allowed to leave the country. It would be one of Cuba's largest prisoner releases in recent history. The announcement coincided with a visit by Spain's foreign minister, Miguel Angel Moratinos, who met Wednesday with his Cuban counterpart Bruno Rodriguez, as well as President Raul Castro and Jaime Ortega, Cuba's Roman Catholic cardinal. The first five prisoners will go to Spain within a few days and the 47 others will depart within four months, Juan Lugo, Spain's Foreign Ministry spokesman, said Wednesday in a telephone call from Madrid. In April 2009, U.S. President Barack Obama said he was seeking ""a new beginning"" in U.S.-Cuba relations. The Obama administration lifted restrictions on the ability of Americans to visit relatives in Cuba as well as limitations on remittances. Wednesday's announcement raised questions about whether the releases will improve dialogue between the two Cold-War foes, though many remained skeptical. ""It's a good thing, but we've seen this before,"" said Daniel Wilkinson, deputy director at Human Rights Watch, citing the hundreds of prisoner releases that followed a papal visit to the island nation in 1998. ""Despite these new developments, the law which allows for arbitrary arrests remains the same."" The Cuban Catholic Church identified the five prisoners to be released soon as: Antonio Villarreal Acosta, Lester Gonzalez Penton, Luis Milan Fernandez, Jose Luis Garcia Paneque and Pablo Pacheco Avila. The six prisoners expected to be transferred soon were identified as: Nelson Molinet Espino, Claro Sanchez Altarriba, Jose Daniel Ferrer Garcia, Marcelo Manuel Cano Rodriguez, Angel Juan Moya Acosta and Luis Enrique Ferrer Garcia. Cardinal Ortega met with Castro in May, describing it at the time as a ""magnificent start"" to talks surrounding the potential release of some jailed dissidents. Last month, Cuba released dissident Darsi Ferrer and ailing prisoner Ariel Sigler, who is awaiting approval from the U.S. government to join family members in Florida. Sigler's release drew praise from the U.S. State Department, which called it ""a positive development."" The two countries broke off diplomatic relations in 1961 but maintain ""interests sections"" in Havana and Washington that operate like embassies. The founder of the Cuban Human Rights and National Reconciliation Commission, Elizardo Sanchez, recently put the number of political prisoners in Cuba at 167, the lowest number in decades. The 52 prisoners to be released were among 75 dissidents arrested in March 2003. The other 23 already have been released. A group of dissidents traveled from Havana to Farinas' hometown of Santa Clara to persuade him to give up the hunger strike. One of them, blogger Yoani Sanchez, posted a photograph on Twitter that shows Farinas in a hospital bed and someone standing next to him holding a red cup. Farinas is wearing a blue hospital gown and lying back on the inclined bed with his eyes closed. The photograph is captioned, ""His first glass of water."" Farinas began his hunger strike in February, shortly after jailed dissident Orlando Zapata Tamayo died in prison at the end of his own prolonged hunger strike. Zapata's death sparked international condemnation from Europe and Washington, and drew a rare statement of regret from Raul Castro. Amnesty International called on the Cuban government Thursday to immediately release all political prisoners, whom the human rights group calls prisoners of conscience because ""they acted non-violently and were imprisoned under Cuban legislation which illegitimately criminalizes political dissent."" In addition, the rights group said the Cuban government must release the remaining political prisoners. Attorney Rolando Jimenez Posada is serving a 12-year sentence on a conviction of ""disrespecting authority and revealing secrets about state security police"" after his peaceful manifestation of support for political prisoners, Amnesty International said. ""The Cuban government must also end the harassment and intimidation of independent journalists, human rights activists and political dissidents,"" Amnesty International said in a statement. ""Vague and arbitrarily applied legal provisions, used to curb dissent within Cuba, must be reviewed to make human rights a reality for all Cubans.""

"Beijing, China (CNN) -- The death toll from an explosion at a factory in eastern China now stands at 10 people, state-run Xinhua news agency said, citing a casualty count from local government officials. At a news conference, officials in the city of Nanjing told reporters that more than 120 people had been hospitalized after a blast ripped through an abandoned plastics factory Wednesday morning. Fourteen of those hospitalized were critically injured, officials said. Workers were dismantling the factory when the explosion occurred. A statement from the state Administration of Work Safety said the explosion came when a motorist started a car engine and ignited leaking gas. The administration says the gas leak occurred after a propylene pipeline was damaged by heavy machinery used to dismantle factory buildings. The damaged pipeline that had been funneling propylene to the factory has been shut down, it said. According to Xinhua, the rescue headquarters says an excavator owned by Yangzhou Hongyuan Construction and Development Co., Ltd. hit the pipeline. The news agency also reports that the excavator operator has been held by police for questioning.","NEW: The death toll rises in a factory explosion .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN)  -- Five U.S. soldiers were wounded Thursday when a suicide bomber attacked a U.S. base, an Afghan official said. The attacker detonated the bomb about 9 p.m. while in the ""sleeping area"" on the base, said Paktia province spokesman Roullah Samoun. It is unclear how the bomber got onto the base, but preliminary investigations show the attacker wore an Afghan border police uniform, Samoun said. NATO's International Security Assistance Force said that ""several ISAF service members from the United States were injured"" in an explosion on their base in eastern Afghanistan's Paktia province. The assistance force did not confirm that the explosion was caused by a suicide bomber. There was no immediate word on the extent of damage. An earlier suicide attack on a U.S. base in Afghanistan killed seven CIA officers and a Jordanian army captain on December 30. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the attack, also on a base in eastern Afghanistan. Former CIA official Robert Richer called the bombing the most loss of life for the agency since the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, in which eight agents died.

Burmese Pythons are rarely seen in the middle Florida Keys, where Lopez works. The Nature Conservancy wants to keep it that way.  Watch huge python wrap around a CNN reporter » . The Python Patrol program was started by Alison Higgins, the Nature Conservancy's Florida Keys conservation manager. She describes it as an ""early detection, rapid response"" program made up of professionals who work outside. Eight Burmese pythons have been found in the Keys. ""If we can keep them from spreading and breeding, then we're that much more ahead of the problem,"" Higgins said. Utility workers, wildlife officials and police officers recently attended a three-hour class about capturing the enormously large snakes. Lt. Jeffrey L. Fobb of the Miami-Dade Fire Rescue Venom Response Unit taught the participants how to capture pythons. ""There's no immutable laws of snake catching. It's what works,"" Fobb said as he demonstrated catching a snake with hooks, bags, blankets and his hands. ""We're doing it in the Florida Keys because we have a lot to protect,"" Higgins said. ""The Burmese pythons that are coming out of the Everglades are eating a lot of our endangered species and other creatures, and we want to make sure they don't breed here."" Where the snakes are breeding is just north of the Keys in Everglades National Park. An estimated 30,000 Burmese pythons live in the park. The Everglades, known as the ""River of Grass,"" is a vast area with a climate perfect for these pythons to hide and breed. And breed they do: The largest clutches of eggs found in the Everglades have numbered up to 83. The snakes grow like they're on steroids. With a life span of 30 years, these pythons can weigh as much as 200 pounds. And the larger the snake, the bigger the prey. Biologists have found endangered wood rats, birds, bobcats and other animals in their stomachs. Two 5-foot-long alligators were found in the stomachs of Burmese pythons that were caught and necropsied, officials say. Officials also say Burmese pythons can travel 1.6 miles a day by land, and they can swim to reach areas outside the Everglades. This nonvenomous species was brought into the United States from Southeast Asia. Everglades National Park spokeswoman Linda Friar says biologists believe that well-intended pet owners are to blame for their introduction into the Everglades. ""These pets were released by owners that do not understand the threat to the ecosystem,"" she said. Higgins says 99,000 of the popular pets were brought into the United States from 1996 to 2006, the most recent data available. She says they are an easy species to breed, and you can buy a hatchling for as little as $20. The problem with these pets, Friar says, is that they get too big for their owners to handle. Making the owner aware of what to expect when the animal becomes full-grown is a priority. ""The pet trade is pretty supportive in educating people,"" Friar said. She hopes a ""Don't let it loose"" message campaign makes an impact on pet owners. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a supporter of restoring the Everglades, has introduced a bill that would ban importing the python species into the United States. The senator saw the need after learning about the effect these snakes were having on the park. ""Finding out many endangered species are being found in the stomach of the python,"" Nelson spokeswoman Susie Quinn said, ""we need to do a better job at protecting the resources."" In the meantime, Lopez and the Python Patrol will continue to protect the Florida Keys by capturing the snakes and turning them over to biologists to perform necropsies. The Nature Conservancy plans to expand the program to all the areas that surround the Everglades, making these predators their prey.

"(CNN) -- Greenpeace activists who have interfered with the launch of a Chevron oil drilling ship in the North Sea say that they have enough fuel and supplies to last several weeks. Activists on board the Greenpeace ship Esperanza attached a bright yellow ""survival pod"" to the giant ship's anchor on Wednesday, effectively keeping it from going to sea. The drill ship Stena Carron, operated under contract by oil giant Chevron, is now holding off the Shetland Islands in the North Sea. Two members of the crew shimmied up the chains, spending Tuesday night hanging above the waves in a small tent. They then secured the survival pod, which is now occupied by two new activists. Inside the ball, there's enough food, fuel and water and even a small toilet to sustain the occupants for up to a month, Greenpeace says. Ben Stewart, leader of the operation, told CNN via satellite phone from the scene that a storm is approaching, but the crew and the activists are safe. The bright yellow ""survival pod"" attached to the giant ship's anchor effectively keeps it from going to sea. The 2-meter diameter pod is hanging from the chain, preventing it from being raised high enough for the 748-foot (228-meter) ship to safely embark. Stewart says that they will stay as long as possible, adding ""every day they are held back is a day that we can avoid the chance of another Gulf of Mexico-style environmental disaster in the North Sea."" The group hopes to pressure Chevron and European Union environmental ministers gathering this week in Norway to support a deepwater drilling moratorium in the North Sea. Chevron says it has been in contact with the activists and stressed the need for safety. ""We fully acknowledge and respect the right of Greenpeace or anyone else to express their views by peaceful and lawful action."" Chevron said in a press release. ""However, we are deeply concerned about activities that put people at risk."" Greenpeace says it has assured the captain of the Stena Carron it will not interfere with the second anchor so the ship will not float into danger. It's the second such boarding action by the Greenpeace team in recent weeks. They boarded an oil drilling rig operated by British company Cairn Energy in Arctic waters off Greenland in August.","Activists have enough fuel and supplies to last several weeks, Greenpeace says .

"(CNN) -- Lawyers for a California death row inmate plan to ask a Marin County Superior court judge Monday to block his execution. If the execution proceeds as scheduled on Wednesday, Albert Greenwood Brown could become the first person to be executed in California since 2006, when legal challenges arose and prompted the state to revise its lethal injection procedure. He could also become the first inmate to be put to death in California's new lethal injection chamber. On Sunday, Brown's lawyers filed papers appealing a federal court judge's refusal to block his execution. Brown also refused to choose between a one-drug lethal injection or a three-drug cocktail, CNN affiliate KTVU said. His refusal meant the state will use a cocktail made of three drugs if the execution goes forward. Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of Susan Jordan, who was walking to Arlington High School in Riverside, California, when Brown pulled her into an orange grove, according to court documents. He raped and strangled her with her own shoelace and took her school identification cards and books. Later that evening, Brown looked up her family in the phone book and called their home, the documents state. ""Hello, Mrs. Jordan, Susie isn't home from school yet, is she?"" court documents quoted him as saying. ""You will never see your daughter again. You can find her body on the corner of Victoria and Gibson."" He also placed a call to police directing them to her body. During the investigation, three witnesses identified Brown as being near the scene of the crime. Police also found Susan's school books and newspaper articles about her death in Brown's home, and clothing with semen stains in Brown's work locker. During the penalty phase of Brown's trial, his lawyer presented psychiatric evidence suggesting that he had emotional problems, including sexual maladjustment and dysfunction, and claimed he was remorseful. The jury deliberated for three hours before returning a death verdict, according to an opinion issued September 19 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. California's last execution was on January 17, 2006, when Clarence Ray Allen was put to death for three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances. From behind bars, he had helped orchestrate a deadly armed robbery at a convenience store. CNN's Chuck Johnston and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","If it proceeds, Albert Greenwood Brown's execution will be first since lethal injection review .

"(CNN) -- Wayne Rooney will be sidelined for up to three weeks, missing crucial games for club side Manchester United and England. United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed Tuesday night that the striker's ankle problem had flared up again. He was substituted in the 2-2 Premier League draw at Bolton on Sunday and did not travel with the United squad for their tough Champions League tie in Valencia on Wednesday night. The injury update from Ferguson means Rooney will miss the Premier League game at Sunderland on Saturday and also England's Euro 2012 qualifier against Montenegro on October 12. Ferguson also revealed that veteran midfielder Paul Scholes will be out for 10 days with a calf problem. ""It will be two to three weeks,"" said Ferguson. ""But it depends because Wayne has done quite well with his recovery from injury in the past."" How we asked Alex Ferguson your questions . Rooney, who has found himself the subject of newspaper revelations about his private life, has struggled for form since the World Cup. He was even left out of the side when United faced former club Everton recently. His manager believes this can be attributed to Rooney's personal problems. ""The boy is starting to realize probably, finally, without any question, what kind of focus is on him as a human being,"" Ferguson told Italian newspaper Gazetta dello Sport recently. ""For a young person, that is not what you want. You want to play and enjoy your football without that attention. That can be quite exhausting."" Ryan Giggs is also missing the trip to the Mestalla Stadium, with the Welshman suffering from a hamstring injury. Despite the absence of three key players, the Old Trafford side will be keen to put the disappointment of their goalless draw with Scottish Champions Rangers in the opening match behind them.

"(CNN) -- Croatia striker Eduardo has left English club Arsenal to join Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk, both teams confirmed on Wednesday. The 27-year-old scored 20 goals in 67 appearances for the London outfit, but his impact was hampered after suffering a serious leg break in February 2008. Eduardo signed a new long-term contract in November, but the Brazil-born player was allowed to leave for an undisclosed fee as he joined 2009 UEFA Cup winners Shakhtar on a four-year deal. The signing of Marouane Chamakh from French club Bordeaux in May left Eduardo down the pecking order at Arsenal, who also have World Cup stars Robin Van Persie and Nicklas Bendtner to call upon up front. ""Eduardo's recovery from his injury sustained at Birmingham City in February 2008 is a testament to his strength as a human being, and this character and determination will be missed by everyone associated at Arsenal,"" the club said in a statement on its website. ""Everyone at Arsenal would like to thank Eduardo for his contribution towards the club and wishes him the best of luck for the future."" Meanwhile, Arsenal's Premier League rivals Liverpool continued rebuilding under new manager Roy Hodgson with the signing of defender Danny Wilson from Scottish champions Rangers. The center-back, 18, agreed a three-year contract in a deal which could be worth up to $7.5 million to the cash-strapped Glasgow side, who have now lost seven players ahead of the new season. Liverpool also unveiled England midfielder Joe Cole, who joined on a free transfer earlier this week after his contract at double winners Chelsea expired. European champions Inter Milan signed Andrea Ranocchia from Genoa for an undisclosed fee on a five-year contract, but the 22-year-old central defender will be loaned back to the Serie A club for the new season. The Italian league winners also sent young striker Mattia Destro on loan to Genoa as part of the deal. It was a busy day for Genoa, who sold Greece's World Cup defender Sokratis Papastathopoulos to AC Milan for a reported $5.7 million on a five-year contract. The 22-year-old was new Milan coach Massimiliano Allegri's first signing since replacing Leonardo. Allegri also tied up veteran former Italy fullback Massimo Oddo, 34, to a new one-year contract, while Milan owner Silvio Berlusconi told reporters that former Brazil star Ronaldinho was not for sale.","Ukrainian champions Shakhtar Donetsk sign Croatia striker Eduardo from Arsenal .

"Washington (CNN) -- When President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act into law, it was clear he would face an uphill battle defending the law and communicating its benefits to the American public. In the months leading to passage, we heard cries of rationing, death panels and blatant mischaracterization of what is in the bill. Since passage, the cries have shifted from rationing to repeal. Efforts to repeal the law have been highlighted by the self-proclaimed ""Young Guns"" of the GOP -- House Minority Whip Eric Cantor of Virginia, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California. President Obama should not be fazed by this or any other calls for repeal. He should do the job he was elected to do and protect patients' interests, but he will need to face a confused public. In a recent national survey conducted by the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, only 14 percent of respondents correctly identified September as the starting month for the law's first set of patient protections. Less than half understood that health reform would allow for them to receive preventive care services without having to pay anything. Even fewer could specifically identify other important provisions that started on or after September 23, 2010. Moreover, a recent Associated Press poll found that a quarter of Americans believe incorrectly that the law designated a panel of government bureaucrats to make decisions about health care for individuals. The confusion and apathy surrounding the health care reform law leaves ample opportunity for others to mischaracterize and foster doubt, energizing and exciting the repeal platform. The unwavering confidence of dissenters is stronger than a mere promise of good. But health care reform will not be repealed, and despite messy politics and angry voices, policymakers, providers, insurance companies and other stakeholders are moving quickly to implement the bill. To override a presidential veto would require a two-thirds majority in the House of Representatives and in the Senate. But even according to the GOP's most optimistic forecasts, Republicans cannot expect to achieve a supermajority in both chambers in November. Republicans may expect to block funds or repeal small parts of the bill. But even that isn't as simple as it sounds. Last week, the Senate voted on two amendments regarding the 1099 provision in the Affordable Care Act introduced by two senators, one by Sen. Mike Johanns, a Republican from Nebraska, and another by Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat from Florida. The 1099 provision requires that businesses report all purchases from vendors over $600, creating a significant burden on small businesses. The Republicans wanted to repeal the provision; Democrats wanted to change it. Neither amendment was able to muster enough support. But more importantly, a repeal of health care reform, followed by a replacement with a more modest set of changes, is tantamount to leaving millions of patients in a state of free fall, with no net to catch them. As a physician, I see the consequences of uninsurance and a broken health care system every day. Frustrated patients, crowded emergency rooms and burdensome insurance requirements are driving good physicians into other professions and making patients feel hopeless. Our system was not working, and we cannot afford to quietly stand by while one in seven lack access to basic care and one in six people live in poverty. It would be unfortunate if our country kept listening to ideological shouting and failed to understand the value of the important provisions in the law. Health reform starts at birth -- health plans will no longer be able to refuse to cover children younger than 19 simply because they were born with a medical condition. From birth through your 26th birthday, you can stay on your family's health insurance plan, regardless of your income or marital status. For female readers of childbearing age, you no longer need a referral to see an OB-GYN doctor. From there, adults and seniors will no longer have cost-sharing provisions for preventive services. And what is a preventive service exactly? There are at least 45 services that will be covered, including everything from nutrition counseling to cancer screening. Last but not least are the elimination of lifetime caps and the gradual elimination of annual coverage limits. Together this all adds up to more patient protections than we have ever had, and this is just the beginning. Keep in mind that some of these provisions will not technically kick in until your health plan starts the new plan year, which usually happens in January. But do not wait until then to get your information; search your plan's website and talk to your employer's human resource department or benefits manager. The real verdict on health reform will likely come in 2014 when an expected 32 million people will be added to insurance exchanges, state Medicaid programs and other private insurance plans. The pathway from here to there is long and filled with many speed bumps, but information, transparency and advocacy are our best friends. As patients, we should ask questions and not be afraid to challenge our health care system, insurance companies and government officials when we are left feeling confused or misguided. As medical providers, we must not compromise our responsibility to first do no harm. We should begin by asking our patients what they do and don't understand and by helping them navigate these uncharted waters together. As Americans we need to send a strong signal to Republican and Democratic leaders that repeal and replace is not an option. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Kavita Patel.","Republicans are pledging to repeal the health care reform law .

"(FT) -- Unilever is to buy Alberto Culver, the US-based consumer goods company, for $3.7bn (£2.3bn) in a deal that will bring brands such as TRESemmé and VO5 into the Anglo-Dutch conglomerate's stable of haircare and skincare products. ""We are delighted to be acquiring Alberto Culver,"" Paul Polman, Unilever chief executive, said on Monday. ""Their people have done an excellent job of building an impressive range of brands such as TRESemmé, VO5, Nexxus, St. Ives and Simple. These will complement Unilever's existing portfolio of iconic brands like Dove, Clear and Sunsilk in hair care and Pond's and Vaseline in skincare, and will help build on our strong global positions in both the hair care and skin care categories."" Shares in Unilever rose 0.3 per cent or 6p to £17.99p in early London trading on Monday. For the 12 months to June, Alberto Culver made revenues of $1.6bn (£1.1bn) and earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortization of more than $250m (£158m). The all-cash deal includes $150m of Alberto Culver's debt. Alberto Culver group employs 2,700 people and has operations in nine countries, including the US, Canada, the UK, Argentina, Mexico and South Africa. While it produces products such as low-sodium food dressings and baking sprays, the acquisition is most significant for adding further weight to Unilever's operations in so-called ""personal care"" products such as skincare, haircare and bodywash. Personal care is the fastest-growing category for global consumer goods companies, especially in emerging markets, and the Alberto Culver acquisition will allow Unilever to have more products across a broader range of price points. In the most recent quarter, Unilever's sales of personal care goods rose 7.8 percent to €3.6bn, compared with growth of only 3.5 percent for ice-cream and beverages, and 0.5 percent for savoury foods, dressings and spreads. The story is the same at Reckitt Benckiser, the maker of Cillit Bang cleaner and Finish dishwasher powder, where health and personal care is growing at 14 percent a year, compared to 8 percent growth across the whole business. The drive to access this fast-growing category prompted Reckitt to purchase SSL International, the maker of Durex condoms and Scholl footcare, in July for £1.5bn ($2.3bn). The Alberto Culver acquisition is the second major deal by Unilever in this product category this year. In September 2009, the group bought the personal care division of Sara Lee, securing Radox bubblebath and Brylcreem hairgel, although the European Commission is still scrutinizing the deal. ""Personal Care is a strategic category for Unilever and growing rapidly,"" said Mr Polman. ""Ten years ago it represented 20 percent of our turnover; strong organic growth has now driven it to reach over 30 percent, with strong positions in many of the emerging markets. ""Organic growth remains the cornerstone of our energizing ambition to double the size of Unilever whilst reducing our overall environmental impact. Bolt-on acquisitions such as Alberto Culver supplement organic growth and add powerful new brands to our portfolio."" Initial analyst response to the acquisition was positive. ""The initial consideration for Alberto Culver of 14.8x EBITDA on the face of it looks quite punchy, but we believe 'significant' but as yet undisclosed synergies will make the price look more reasonable,"" said Graham Jones and Damian McNeela at Panmure Gordon in a note to investors. ""It further skews Unilever to high-growth, high-margin personal care categories, gives a more rounded category presence in hair care and makes it global leader in hair conditioning, number two in shampoo and number three in styling.""","Anglo-Dutch conglomerate Unilever to buy Alberto Culver for $3.7bn (£2.3bn).

"Cairo, Egypt (CNN) -- The Libyan-backed ship carrying humanitarian goods for Gaza is headed to Egypt, a move that averts a showdown between Israel and the people on the vessel and generates more aid for the people in the beleaguered Palestinian land. The Gadhafi Foundation, a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi, told CNN in a statement Wednesday that it ordered the aid ship to dock at Al Arish in northeastern Egypt near Gaza. It said the ship was in Egyptian waters and will be at the port in two or three hours. Egyptian Foreign Ministry spokesman Husam Zaki confirmed that Egypt has approved a request from the vessel to dock there. Israeli officials -- who said the military had been making plans to stop the ship from going to Gaza -- had been saying since Tuesday the ship would go to Egypt and not Gaza. The foundation said that its ""purpose"" was about ""peace, not confrontation or provocation."" ""Our goal was humanitarian and to highlight the Palestinian issue. For that, so the mission has been accomplished. Bloodshed was not the objective but the ship has accomplished its own objective through negotiations with Israel."" Israel has asked entities carrying Gaza-bound cargo to dock in the Israeli city of Ashdod, where material would be unloaded and then transported to the Gaza border. But the ship organizers said that the Israeli port ""was never an option."" However, the group said it secured concessions for letting more aid and help into Gaza and termed the effort a ""breakthrough."" The ship, which sailed from Greece on Saturday carrying 2,000 tons of aid, is the latest Gaza-bound aid ship attempting to breach an Israeli naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza. Israel says it must inspect all goods that enter Gaza so that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement that has said it is dedicated to the destruction of Israel. Israel came under fierce international criticism for killing nine people in the course of boarding a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship in May. Israel said the activists on that ship attacked its troops when they boarded the boat. The Gadhafi Foundation refers to the ship as the Hope, although it appears to be registered as the MV Amalthea. It is Moldovan-flagged and run by ACA Shipping, based in Greece. According to the Israeli military, 164 truck loads of goods went into Gaza on Tuesday, saying it was more aid than the Libyan ship has on it. The Israeli assault on the Turkish ship reverberated internationally and shined light on the Gaza blockade. Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident, but an Israeli military investigation was conducted into the boarding of the Mavi Marmara and it criticized some aspects of the operation. The operation prepared only one course of action and had no backup plan, military commanders were not presented with options other than boarding the ship, and different branches of military intelligence did not coordinate well enough, the report found. But the report said the commando team that boarded the ship operated properly, with bravery and professionalism, and that the use of live fire was justified. CNN's Izzy Lemberg, Talal Abu-Rahma, Zain Verjee, Ben Wedeman and Paul Colsey contributed to this report.","NEW: The ship is in Egyptian waters, foundation says .

"(CNN) -- In recent days, international attention has refocused on the rapidly deteriorating security situation in Yemen. The claim of responsibility for the attack on Northwest flight 253 on December 25 by al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula has underscored the fact that Yemen's problems will not stay in Yemen. In the absence of immediate and sustained attention by the international community, Yemen may be overwhelmed by a unique convergence of crises. While some observers feared this would come in several years, it is increasingly apparent that failure may come sooner than previously expected. Yemen has frequently been described as a failing state -- and with good reason. Civil war, terrorism, a deepening secessionist movement and economic and demographic trends threaten to overpower the Yemeni government, provide a breeding ground for terrorists and destabilize the region. Yemen has often teetered on the brink of collapse, but it has never faced so many interconnected challenges at one time. At the heart of the country's problems is a looming economic crisis. Oil is the source of nearly 80 percent of government revenue, and it is quickly running out. There are few viable options for a sustainable post-oil economy, and Yemen is already the poorest country in the Arab world with an unemployment rate conservatively estimated at 35 percent. Yemen's pending economic collapse has been greatly accelerated by the civil war in Saada. Government forces have been unable to decisively put down the rebels in the north of the country, and there is no military solution to the conflict. The toll in Saada has been severe, with extensive damage to infrastructure and an estimated 175,000 internally displaced people. The conflict's strain on the Yemeni army has led to questions about the military's ability to simultaneously engage in other operations, including counterterrorism. The government is spending foreign currency reserves at an alarming rate, recently estimated at more than $200 million per month. Spending on the war will create a major budget deficit next year. Every dollar spent on the civil war is a dollar not spent on addressing the underlying causes of instability in Yemen. Yemen also is facing a growing secessionist movement in the south of the country. When the war in Saada subsides, it is feared that the secessionist movement will again flare up. The government does not control the entire territory of Yemen, and the emergence of additional areas outside of the capital of Sanaa's control will create more under-governed spaces that can be exploited by terrorist movements. For the past year, there have been growing indications that al Qaeda is regrouping in Yemen and preparing to strike Western and other targets. Recent counterterrorism measures in Saudi Arabia have forced extremists to seek refuge elsewhere, and analysts have observed a steady flow of extremists relocating to Yemen's under-governed areas. In spring 2008, al Qaeda operatives in Saudi Arabia were encouraged by local Saudi al Qaeda commanders to escape to Yemen, and by January 2009, the Saudi and Yemeni al Qaeda affiliates merged. A video announcing the establishment of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula featured two Saudis previously released from the U.S. military detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba -- both assumed leadership positions in the newly formed organization. Mohammed al-Awfi subsequently surrendered to Saudi authorities and Said al-Shihri reportedly escaped a recent counterterrorism strike that preceded the Northwest bombing. The emergence of the regional al Qaeda group marks a major deterioration of security in Yemen. As recent events have highlighted, Yemen is becoming a base for al Qaeda to mount operations not only inside the country but also across the Arabian Peninsula and internationally. In August 2009, al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula nearly assassinated Prince Mohammed bin Nayef, the Saudi counterterrorism chief, in an attack that was eerily similar to the Christmas Day Northwest bomb attack. Following the attack on Prince Mohammed, it boasted of its new bomb technology and threatened to use its new 'undetectable substance' again. And in mid-October, several Saudis were killed trying to cross into Saudi Arabia, including the brother of deputy commander Said al-Shihri. According to local press reports, the two were attempting to smuggle several suicide vests into Saudi Arabia. Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula was allegedly bolstered by the relocation of al Qaeda operatives from Pakistan and Afghanistan this summer. Media reports quoted intelligence sources saying that fighters fleeing from South Asia were seeking safe havens in Yemen and Somalia. Any single event -- or more likely a confluence of worst-case events beyond the ability of the Yemeni government to control -- could lead to a further erosion of central government authority in Yemen and destabilization of the region. As the central government's authority and legitimacy continue to deteriorate, there will be more opportunities for extremists directed or inspired by al Qaeda to regroup, organize, train and launch operations against U.S. and allied targets throughout the Gulf region and globally. Military operations to kill or capture al Qaeda operatives will likely increase in 2010. These actions carry risks. Publicly acknowledged American involvement in counterterrorism operations in Yemen would be deeply unpopular in the country, likely undermine the legitimacy of the Yemeni government and feed into the grievances that help fuel al Qaeda militancy. Development assistance is one of the most effective tools available to address the interconnected long-term challenges facing Yemen. But, U.S. aid is disproportionately small considering the magnitude of the problems facing the country and Yemen's strategic importance to the United States. In addition to the reported $70 million of military and security assistance, the United States recently announced $121 million in development aid over the next three years, a significant increase from previous years and a vital step in the right direction. Still, the amount pales in comparison to the $1.5 billion allotted to Pakistan in the next year alone. This disparity persists even as U.S. officials increasingly cite Yemen as a terrorism and security priority second only to Afghanistan and Pakistan. No perfect solutions exist for Yemen's problems today, and none of its many pressing challenges can be fully averted. However, steps can be taken to lessen their impact. The United States has a stake in helping Yemen deal with its problems, and the cost of inaction would be too great. Failure to act now would lead to fewer and even worse options in the future. As one administration official recently said to me, ""We've seen this movie before, and we know how it ends.""

It's been difficult to protect Indonesia's small islands with a tsunami warning system, but most of them will be covered by February 2011, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the Indonesian national board for disaster management. The effectiveness of a warning system also would depend on the size of a tsunami and residents' proximity to it. Monday's tsunami destroyed or carried away 517 homes, officials said. On the country's hard-hit Mentawai Islands, at least six of the 27 villages were ""practically been flattened,"" state media said, citing the governor of West Sumatra. The quake struck at 9:42 p.m. Monday, triggering a tsunami warning. Its epicenter was 240 kilometers (150 miles) south of Padang, at a depth of 20.6 kilometers (12.8 miles), according to the U.S. Geological Survey. The magnitude was revised from a preliminary 7.5. The remoteness of many Indonesian islands left residents without warning, and continued to limit communications and stymie rescue and recovery efforts. Medicine and supplies being used to treat hundreds of injured residents are being depleted, Antara reported. On Friday, four warships from the naval base in Padang, West Sumatra, were to arrive to offer aid to victims in the Mentawai islands, according to Antara. The ships were carrying medical supplies and medical personnel from the marines, Antara said, citing Col. Indarto Budiarto. Volunteers, a helicopter and a plane also were aboard the ships. The naval base in Padang had set up aid command posts in the Mentawai waters, as well as medical command posts for victims, Antara said. A cargo plane also was ferrying supplies. The colonel also asked aid donors to channel supplies through the base in Padang. ""We are trying to prevent the accumulation of aid for Mentawai,"" he told Antara. The United States will provide $2 million in humanitarian assistance in response to this week's tsunami and the eruption of the Mount Merapi volcano, which killed dozens and displaced thousands, the U.S. ambassador in Indonesia announced Friday. The funds will be used to purchase relief items and help displaced people resume their lives, Ambassador Scot Marciel told students at the University of Indonesia, the embassy said in a statement. Earlier Friday, the European Commission announced it was offering 1.5 million euro ($2.1 million) to help the victims of the tsunami and the volcano eruption. ""This envelope will help around 65,000 people in Mentawai and at least 22,000 people in Yogyakarta/Central Java,"" the European Commission said in a news release. ""Humanitarian partners will use these funds to provide water and sanitation to victims; access to primary health care and disease control; food and nonfood items; emergency telecommunications, emergency shelter; psychological support; logistics and will mainstream disaster preparedness,"" the release said. The city of Padang and the Mentawai Islands are at the meeting place of two tectonic plates, making them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis. On December 26, 2004, a 9.1-magnitude earthquake struck off northern Sumatra. A tsunami generated by that earthquake killed more than 225,000 people in 14 countries -- mainly India, Indonesia, Maldives, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The Indonesian region of Banda Aceh was hard-hit: About 150,000 died there. CNN's Paula Hancocks and Kathy Quiano contributed to this report.","Government considers relocating citizens .

"(CNN) -- An aid worker with Samaritan's Purse, a Christian aid organization, has been freed after 105 days in captivity in the Darfur region of western Sudan, a spokeswoman for the organization said Monday. Flavia Wagner, 35, is ""exhausted but in good health,"" the group said in a statement. News of the release came as three Russian pilots working for a Sudanese aviation company were abducted in the same region. The pilots were taken Sunday in Nyala, South Darfur's capital, said Chris Cycmanick, spokesman for the African Union-United Nations Mission in Darfur. Twelve people have been abducted in Darfur this year, Cycmanick said, including Wagner. She was kidnapped May 18, the U.S. Embassy in Khartoum said a day later. Two Sudanese colleagues were seized at the same time, Samaritan's Purse said then. The abduction took place about 25 miles southwest of Nyala. The two Sudanese men were released May 25, Samaritan's Purse said. Samaritans's Purse, founded by evangelist Franklin Graham, said it has provided $83.7 million in assistance to Sudan since 2001. The group has 548 national and expatriate staff in Sudan, it says, adding that it ""provides immediate response to the physical and spiritual needs of individuals in crisis situations."" Darfur has been beset by conflict since 2003 after rebels began an uprising against the Sudanese government. To counter the rebels, Arab militias with ties to the Sudanese government went from village to village in Darfur, killing, torturing and raping residents there, according to the United Nations, Western governments and human rights organizations. The militias targeted civilian members of tribes from which the rebels drew strength. The United Nations estimates that 300,000 people have been killed in the conflict in Darfur, and 2.5 million have fled their homes. Sudan denies the death toll is that high. The International Criminal Court has issued an arrest warrant for Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir, accusing him of war crimes and crimes against humanity -- charges he denies.

"(CNN) -- As the two Australian miners lay trapped in a space less than 5 feet square and 3,000 feet below the surface, they discovered common ground in American country singer Kenny Rogers. ""I'm more rock and roll, he's more country, but we both knew 'The Gambler,' by Kenny Rogers,"" Brant Webb said of Todd Russell, who spent 14 days trapped with Webb in the Beaconsfield gold mine in northern Tasmania in 2006. The two sang to pass the time, shared their life stories and told jokes after a 2.2-magnitude earthquake triggered an underground rock fall, trapping them in darkness. They could not sit or stand. They were so cramped, one had to lie on his side if the other lay on his back. Five days into their captivity, rescuers located them and established a phone line. The men were kept abreast of rescue efforts and were given counseling throughout the ordeal. Rescuers also passed them food, water and iPods. But it would take another nine days for them to be extricated from the dank hole that Webb, at times, thought might become his grave. He never let the idea knock around his mind for too long, choosing to cling to hope that he would live to see his wife and two children. It's the same advice he has for 33 Chilean miners facing the prospect of remaining trapped 2,300 feet below ground for several months. ""They've got to keep their heads together and hope alive,"" Webb said in a telephone interview from his home in Beauty Point, Tasmania. ""They've got air, they've got food and water; they'll get them out of there eventually."" The miners have been trapped in the San Jose copper and gold mine in northern Chile since its roof collapsed on August 5. Rescuers took 17 days to locate them, during which the men rationed small amounts of tuna and mackerel to survive. Rescuers were eventually able to send supplies through a 4-inch pipe. On Friday, the miners were informed that it could take another three to four months to get them out. The miners and their families will face stresses that could continue once the men are freed, experts and those who have survived similar ordeals say. Chilean authorities have sought guidance from NASA and other institutions in the United States on how to help the miners cope with their environment on physical, mental and logistical levels. The most common comparison in academia to their situation and others like it is space travel. Astronauts and cosmonauts spend weeks or months in enclosed spaces cut off from society and loved ones, although to a lesser extent these days with the advancement of telecommunications. ""There is a dialogue going on between Chile's Ministry of Health and NASA, where we have a great deal of experience regarding medical, nutritional and behavioral issues related to space travel,"" State Department Spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday. ""[We] are providing that perspective to Chile, so that it can develop a program for helping to sustain these miners."" In addition to maintaining nutritional and hygienic needs, the men will need to develop a routine that resembles a normal life, down to mealtimes, showers and light to mimic daytime, said Joseph Barbera, co-director of the Institute for Crisis, Disaster, and Risk Management at George Washington University. ""A large part of maintaining their mental well-being is allowing them to have a sense of control over the situation. That's part of the reason why you want to develop a routine,"" said Barbera, who is also a member of the Fairfax County Urban Search & Rescue Task Force in Virginia, which has offered assistance to the Chilean government through the Office of U.S. Foreign Disaster Assistance. The Chilean miners are already adopting various roles to help them through their ordeal and give structure to their existence. A shift leader is fulfilling a leadership role and another man with nursing experience is carrying out basic medical and psychological tests. Maintenance mechanics helped organize the space. The men have split into two shifts so half can rest while the others keep busy doing tasks, exercising or playing card games or dominoes. Stretchers that were stored in the rescue cabin are being used as beds. They hold daily meetings and make decisions by consensus, according to a video the men sent to the surface Thursday. Barbera, along with Webb and others who have shared the harrowing experience of being trapped in isolation, agreed that one asset the Chilean miners have is space. Portions of a 131-foot-long (40-meter) shaft are being used as a latrine. The shaft is connected to the main 538-square-foot (50-square-meter) cabin, which is being used for sleeping, washing and praying. ""[The space] makes a significant difference, because it's not so cramped that they can't stretch out. It sounds like they'll have enough space to move around and potentially have some personal space and privacy,"" Barbera said. ""The big downside is length of time, as far as how long it'll take to get them out,"" he said. ""If they can maintain their psyche and develop a regular routine to stay psychologically fit, hopefully, they'll make it. But this situation has no precedent."" Like the Chileans, who have asked for playing cards and religious figures to create a shrine, the Australian miners also received items to pass the time, including magazines, iPods, toothbrushes and clothes. When food first began to come, however, in the form of sweets, the rush of sugar overwhelmed their systems, making the situation even more unpleasant, Webb said. ""That was definitely a low point,"" Webb said, laughing. Maintaining contact with people on the surface, especially loved ones, will help the Chilean miners, he said. ""That was a big stumbling block, thinking that if anything did happen I never coulda said, 'I love my wife,' "" Webb said. The Chilean workers sent a video message to their families Thursday in which they expressed thanks for the efforts under way to free them and assured them they were OK. Nine coal miners trapped in southwestern Pennsylvania in 2002 wrote notes to their loved ones as water inched within 70 feet of where they sat huddled. The letters were sealed in a bucket to be found with their bodies, said Mary Pugh, whose son, Robert Pugh, was one of the men known now as the ""Quecreek 9."" All were rescued. She has never seen her son's letter, nor does she want to. ""It was just so sad, such a sad time. I don't want to hear the story again unless my son wants to tell me,"" said Pugh, a lifelong resident of Somerset County, Pennsylvania. Her father, husband and brothers have all spent time in the mines. For nearly five days in July 2002, Pugh awaited news at the Sipesville Fire Hall, surrounded by children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren, as well as the families of the eight other miners. Together, they rode out the ups and downs of the rescue effort with support from the community. ""It was crowded, food galore. They kept bringing the breakfasts, lunches, dinners, we didn't have to cook all weekend,"" she said. ""But we always came home to sleep because it was so crowded. Not that we actually slept."" The first few days that her husband and son-in-law were trapped, Denise Foy could not bring herself to sleep or eat. ""I thought that if he's not going to eat, I'm not going to eat,"" she said. ""But I worried more for my daughter than for me because her husband was down there, too. She was really taking it hard. To have your father and husband in there, it was a lot worse for her because those were the two main men in her life."" Most of the Quecreek 9 declined to speak to CNN about the incident. But Thomas Foy said the key to their survival was simple: ""stick together, keep warm and stay alive."" ""We went through hell the first time, trying to escape. We were swimming through water up to our chins. We tried three different entries, but weren't nothing we could do. They were all full. But when we heard them drilling we knew it was just gonna take time. We weren't about to give up."" Words were scarce as the men sat in darkness more than 200 feet below ground, soaking wet and huddled together for body heat, Foy said. ""Wasn't too many things to talk about; about how long it's gonna take, but we really didn't know. We just sat and waited and waited and waited, talked about how we're never gonna go back in the mines,"" he recalled. The first stage of preparing the Australians for their rescue began with injections of blood thinners they administered to themselves to prevent clots as a result of lying down for two weeks, Webb said. After the rescue, the real work of returning to society a new person began, not just for the survivors, but for their families. ""Your loved ones need to be ready for the emotional highs and lows. There's this huge high when you get out, then life goes back to normal, and you go back down,"" he said. Webb, now a part-time real estate agent, said he has watched only four movies since he's been out. ""The highs and lows are so extreme. When I'm sad, I cry. When I'm happy, I laugh a lot, probably too much. And your family needs to be ready to deal with all that."" Webb said he and Russell followed advice to do speaking engagements about their ordeal to exorcise their mind of the experience. That, along with three years of counseling and a two-week caving expedition have got him to a place where he's happy. ""Just one of those things, fall off the bike and get back on it. I didn't want to have a hang-up. But I have found a new career.""

"(CNN) -- A Libyan-backed ship carrying humanitarian goods for Gaza docked Thursday at Al Arish in northern Egypt and unloaded tons of aid from the Gadhafi Foundation, a charity headed by the son of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi. The vessel reached Egypt after sailing from Greece on Saturday with 2,000 tons of aid. It was the latest ship attempting to breach an Israeli naval blockade of the Palestinian territory of Gaza whose captain was persuaded to dock elsewhere instead. The aid includes food, medicine, and construction materials to be taken from the port to the Gaza border about 25 miles (42 km) away. Israel said it must inspect all goods prior to their entering Gaza to ensure that weapons do not get into the hands of militants. Gaza is run by Hamas, the Palestinian Islamist movement. The Gadhafi Foundation refers to the ship as the Hope, although it appears to be registered as the MV Amalthea. It is Moldovan-flagged and run by ACA Shipping, based in Greece. Israel came under fierce international criticism after Israeli navy commandos boarded a Gaza-bound Turkish aid ship in May and nine people died. Israel said the activists on that ship attacked its troops when they boarded the boat. The Israeli assault on the Turkish ship reverberated internationally and highlighted the Gaza blockade. Israel has resisted demands for an international inquiry into the incident, but an Israeli military investigation into the boarding of the Mavi Marmara criticized some aspects of the operation.

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- Indonesia's Mount Merapi started spewing hot ash clouds Monday morning, sending a 1.5-kilometer plume toward the south. Volcanic ash also blew eastward toward Boyolali, Central Java, said Kurniadi of the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Disaster Monitoring staff. Kurniadi goes by one name, as many Indonesians do. Residents on the volcano started fleeing yet again. Many had returned to their homes to check on them as well as their farm animals after eruptions last week. Mount Merapi began erupting Tuesday and has killed at least 39 people in the past week. Another 74 have been injured and more than 71,000 people have been evacuated, according to the National Disaster Management Board. The 3,000-meter Merapi is famously unpredictable. An eruption killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930. Also last week, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 449. Hundreds more were injured.","NEW: Death toll from recent eruptions is now 39 .

"Miami, Florida (CNN) -- A disorganized Tropical Storm Tomas limped toward the central Caribbean Monday, but forecasters said the storm could re-intensify into a rare November hurricane later this week. As of 5 p.m. Monday, the center of Tomas was about 65 miles (105 kilometers) north-northeast of Aruba and about 400 miles (640 kilometers) south-southeast of Port-au-Prince, Haiti. It had maximum sustained winds of 45 mph (75 kph), with higher gusts, and was moving west at 12 mph (19 kph). No coastal watches or warnings were in effect associated with Tomas, according to the Miami, Florida-based National Hurricane Center. But the center urged residents of Jamaica, the Dominican Republic and Haiti to keep an eye on the storm, which is expected to continue westward over the next day or two and slow down. Tracking maps show that Tomas could take a sharp turn to the northeast and approach Haiti later in the week, possibly as a Category 1 hurricane. The storm could deal another blow to the island nation, which is still recovering from a devastating January earthquake and currently battling a cholera outbreak. But ""Tomas could still hit anywhere from the Dominican Republic to eastern Cuba,"" CNN meteorologist Taylor Ward said. Tropical storm-force winds extend out 140 miles (220 kilometers) from Tomas' center, mainly to the east, the Hurricane Center said. Tomas is expected to continue weakening, but ""restrengthening could begin by late Tuesday,"" forecasters said. The forecast track for Tomas, a storm which formed in late October, is typical for November hurricanes, CNN meteorologist Bonnie Schneider wrote on a blog for HLN's ""Morning Express."" Although hurricanes are less likely to form in November, ""the month isn't always hurricane-free,"" Schneider said. ""Two fairly recent November hurricanes include Hurricane Lenny in 1999 and Hurricane Michelle in 2001."" September is usually the most likely month for tropical storm formation, according to Schneider. But ""often this time of year, the westerly wind is strong enough to steer the storms out to sea into the Atlantic, rather than northwestward into the Gulf of Mexico."" The Atlantic hurricane season ends November 30. Tomas lashed the Caribbean island of St. Vincent over the weekend, prompting about 1,000 people to enter shelters. Two people were injured, including one critically, when they tried to repair roof damage during the storm, said Michelle Forbes, acting director of National Emergency Management. Tomas also left downed trees that blocked many roads, Forbes said, and large areas of the island lacked power. More than 100 homes sustained roof damage, she said, and authorities expected the number to rise.

"United Nations (CNN) -- President Barack Obama will address the U.N. General Assembly on Wednesday as world leaders continue to lay down their achievements and goals in the effort to decrease world poverty. The American president will be among those addressing the Millennium Development Goals, an ambitious agenda world leaders set 10 years ago to tackle global poverty, which has grown amid the world economic recession. Others are addressing biodiversity. Speakers on Wednesday focused on a wide range of policies and issues, such as family planning and health care. Jose Manuel Barroso, president of the European Commission, said, ""Our ability to end poverty and hunger and improve child and maternal health depends upon the long-term availability of fresh water, food, medicine, and raw materials that nature provides."" Francois Bozize, president of the Central African Republic, said the country is taking steps at dealing with impoverishment and other issues, such as infrastructure and life expectancy. But he acknowledged that the challenges his nation faces are great. ""Poverty rates in our country continue to be alarming,"" he said. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said a rescue package similar to that introduced after the global financial crisis is needed to block the worldwide loss of biodiversity. On Thursday, Obama will be among the world leaders speaking at the U.N. General Assembly's annual general debate, where he will address a wide range of issues. Obama will seek to project the image of a nation taking the lead, highlighting the benefits of renewed U.S. leadership on foreign policy, from reviving the world economy to pushing tough new sanctions on Iran and North Korea through the U.N. Security Council, to renewed momentum on nuclear disarmament and rejoining the U.N. Human Rights Council. His administration also hopes to rally continued support this week for Haiti's reconstruction after the earthquake and to help Pakistan recover from devastating floods. There is no shortage of diplomatic hot spots for Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton to review with world leaders on the sidelines of the U.N. debate, starting with the Middle East peace process and the war in Afghanistan. With less than a week before the deadline for a moratorium on Israeli settlement construction to expire, Clinton is hoping to get some momentum on peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians. Regarding Afghanistan, as the Taliban continues to gain traction throughout the country, the administration wants to consult with allies about the road ahead as it gears up for its own policy review this December. This week, Obama also will participate in a high-level meeting on Sudan, to help boost U.N. efforts to oversee a referendum on independence for southern Sudan, a step that risks reigniting the decades-long civil war. The United States has stepped up efforts in recent weeks to help mediate between Sudan's rival factions in the hope of securing a peaceful vote. Iran also looms large, as it seems to each year. The nuclear standoff between Iran and the West is a common theme during every modern-day U.N. General Assembly. Last year, Iran was a main topic when leaders from Security Council nations gathered to talk nuclear disarmament, and the United States disclosed the discovery of a secret nuclear facility at Qom just days after world leaders gathered in New York. This year, Obama is expected to use his speech to argue that is it not the United States but the whole international community that has problems with Iran. He will stress the door to engagement with Iran is still open. Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is also attending the U.N. General Assembly this week and his appearance in New York has met with street protests. On Tuesday, Ahmadinejad blamed capitalism for the world's woes during the anti-poverty conference. He  is scheduled to appear on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Wednesday night and to address the General Assembly on Thursday. Iranian-Americans plan to stage a rally Thursday that condemns his presence at the United Nations and protests the Iranian regime, which many critics revile for what they say are its anti-democratic policies.

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Taliban militants beheaded six Afghan police officers during a raid in northern Baghlan province, officials said Wednesday. The militants had attacked a school, clinic and the district governor's office in Dahanah-e Ghori. They overran a police checkpoint and killed the six police officers, according to NATO's International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) and Munshi Abdul Majid, the governor of Baghlan. In all, eight police officers were at the checkpoint, Munshi said. They defended themselves for two hours during the skirmish before the beheadings. The grisly incident occurred Tuesday in a province that had until recently been largely spared from violence and on the same day that participants at an international donors conference in Kabul agreed that Afghan forces should take over security for the troubled nation by 2014.

"(CNN) -- How are fads started and spread? Do certain influential people play a key role, or is it truly random? How does a trend go from new and exciting to old and passe so quickly? Does having happy friends have an effect on our own happiness? Maybe Twitter can tell us. Every second, millions of people across the world are sharing their thoughts in the form of 140-character messages using Twitter. The ""tweets"" range from the mundane to the profound, and convey, for example, what people are doing, thinking and reading at any moment. The amount of information in any individual tweet is highly variable, but in aggregate the more than 65 million tweets composed per day represent a detailed, real-time trace of the collective thoughts and feelings of a significant fraction of the population -- potentially offering valuable information to everyone from politicians to advertisers to social researchers. To demonstrate the unique power of Twitter data, our research group at Northeastern University and Harvard Medical School recently began a study to infer the mood of Twitter users in the United States from their public tweets. We can observe very distinct patterns over the course of the day, as well as weekly patterns that match conventional wisdom, such as the tendency of users to write happier tweets on weekends. We also observe geographic variations, with users from Hawaii, California, and Florida, for example, using happier words in their tweets. With Twitter, we now not only know which users are communicating, but we also know what they are saying. From a research perspective, Twitter is more than just a new tool; it's an entirely new kind of tool. Never before have academic researchers had access to this much real-time public information about what people are thinking and saying. It is analogous to being allowed to tap into millions of water-cooler conversations, school rooms and other public conversations across the globe. Our study is preliminary; we need more data to do a proper evaluation, and the results are subject to any number of biases (people using language differently across the United States, and different demographics using Twitter at different times). Our approach simply looks, for example, for occurrences of ""happy"" or ""unhappy"" words in tweets. However, because we take words out of context, our approach will not correctly interpret tweets like ""I am not happy"". Even so, initial results demonstrate that Twitter data contain a wealth of information, and that even relatively simplistic approaches such as ours can extract interesting results. In fact, other research groups have also begun to examine Twitter data and have demonstrated that it can be used to predict the box-office success of an upcoming movie. And Twitter data yields much more detailed polling when compared to traditional methods, enabling real-time feedback for issues that are of local, national or international interest. In the past, researchers studying traces of human communication, such as phone records, have shown that the social network that connects us has rich hidden complexity. But legal and privacy concerns have caused these previous studies to almost universally omit the content of the communication. Because most users leave their tweets public, Twitter represents an unprecedented opportunity. This is why researchers owe a debt of gratitude to Twitter for its policy of open access to public tweets (exemplified by the recent donation of its entire public tweet history to the Library of Congress). Like any scientific tool, the ability to use the data for research is subject to caveats and limitations. Unlike many existing tools, such as surveys and polls, researchers cannot ask a question of the Twitter users directly; instead, researchers must determine whether the question is one that the Twitter data can answer. Should we determine how to extract information reliably, which we're working on, the potential applications of the data are almost endless. For example, monitoring the mood of the public chatter on Twitter could allow businesses to quickly identify and respond to incidents, mitigating the effect of negative publicity on their brand. The data could be used to inform public policy, allowing public officials and politicians to receive feedback from their constituents in real time. From a scientific standpoint, Twitter data can shed light on how information spreads through society. Researchers can also investigate network effects: How does what our friends discuss influence what we discuss? In short, the data that is now becoming available from Twitter and related websites offers a new lens through which we can view society. It promises new approaches to understanding social phenomena, what some colleagues have dubbed ""computational social science."" This new kind of data presents new challenges, such as privacy, anonymity and legality, but developing a science around it has the potential to do enormous good.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India's prime minister called a meeting with two ministers for Thursday evening as the country scrambles to pull together the problem-plagued Commonwealth Games. Sports Minister M.S. Gill and Urban Development Minister Jaipal Reddy are to meet with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, said Singh spokesman Harish Khare. Indian Home Minister P. Chidambaram set timelines Thursday for the organizing committee and other authorities to complete any work on the Games, the Home Ministry said, though it released no details about the deadlines or possible consequences for missing them. Commonwealth Games chief Mike Fennell was expected in New Delhi on Thursday, but the prime minister's office said Fennell has not yet requested a meeting with Singh. India's ability to host the Games, which begin a week from Sunday, has been put in doubt after a bridge collapse and criticism of the athletes' village as ""uninhabitable"" and ""filthy."" New Zealand and Canada became the latest Commonwealth members to delay their delegations' departures for the Games because of hygiene and security. New Zealand's Olympic Committee said its athletes were supposed to arrive this weekend, but now may not arrive until Tuesday. Canada postponed the departure for the women's field hockey team, two shooting athletes, and staff including medical professionals for two days, Commonwealth Games Canada (CGC) announced. ""The bottom line is that the accommodations in the athletes' village simply aren't ready,"" said Scott Stevenson, CGC's director of sport. Concerns over the Games' village . ""We're working extremely hard with local authorities to get the finishing work and the clean-up done, but it's going to take more time. More importantly, we have not received the official clearance from the host organizing committee and the Commonwealth Games Federation that the village is ready for its official opening."" Scotland was the first to announce it was delaying its delegation's departure, saying Tuesday the athletes' village is unfinished and ""nowhere near an acceptable standard in terms of health, safety and hygiene."" Structural problems at the venues are also causing concern. A pedestrian bridge collapsed at a stadium Tuesday, injuring 27 people, and ceiling tiles fell off the same stadium Wednesday. A growing number of star athletes have withdrawn from the Games because of safety and hygiene fears. The latest is Welshman Geraint Thomas, a gold medal winner in the team pursuit cycling event at the Beijing Olympics. His fellow Team Sky colleagues Peter Kennaugh from the Isle of Man and England's Ian Stannard have also pulled out. Thomas and Kennaugh have voiced concerns over mosquito-borne Dengue fever. English world triple jump champion Phillips Idowu announced Tuesday he was pulling out, saying on his Twitter blog, ""When people are being hurt by collapsing bridges and part of a roof in a venue falling in, plus all the other issues in and around the village (it) doesn't instill complete confidence."" Other leading athletes to pull out Australia's Dani Samuels, the world discus champion, and Canadian archers Kevin Tataryn and Dietmar Trillus, according to CNN affiliate Global Network News. The Commonwealth Games take place every four years among members of the former British empire. South Africa's delegation said it still planned to have its team compete at the Games, but warned it could reconsider if the situation changed. ""The safety and health of Team South Africa are of paramount importance to us and if any stage we feel that this is compromised in any way, we will not hesitate to bring the team back home,"" said Tubby Reddy, chief executive of the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee. Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard reminded citizens of the government's travel advisory for India, which warns of a high risk of terrorism in New Delhi, where the games are scheduled to be held. The Australian High Commission has sought repeated assurances from Indian authorities about the safety and ""structural integrity"" of the games, she told a news conference Thursday. Australia's minister for sport, Mark Arbib, is also seeking an update on the readiness of the facilities, she said.

"(CNN) -- At least 18 people were killed Saturday when chaos broke out at a music festival in Duisburg, Germany, police said. The panic at ""Love Parade 2010"" left ""many"" injured, according to police, who declined to give a specific number because many of those injured were taken to hospitals around the country, including some who had to be airlifted. Carsten Lueb of CNN affiliate NTV said that the number of injured was possibly into the hundreds. German Chancellor Angela Merkel issued a statement offering her condolences to the victims' families, saying ""my sadness and empathy goes out to them."" ""The young people came to celebrate; instead people were killed and injured,"" the statement said. ""I am distraught and sad in the face of the suffering and pain."" Lueb told CNN that some 1.4 million people showed up at the popular festival, which features dozens of DJs spinning techno music for hours. Organizers expected only 700,000 to 800,000 attendees, so they opened an additional event site to accommodate more people. The deadly crush happened in an underpass between the main event site and the expansion area. Witnesses told NTV that people pushed into the tunnel from both sides until it was dangerously overcrowded. The panic began as festival-goers began to lose consciousness as they were crushed against the walls and each other. After the panic, a line of emergency vehicles, including helicopters, could be seen parked on the highway leading to the festival site, carrying away people injured in the crush. The festival itself, however, went on. Police were afraid that ending the music altogether could cause further unrest among the massive crowd. Witnesses also told NTV that police were warned at least an hour before the incident that the underpass was becoming dangerously crowded. NTV reported that there were 1,400 police officers on hand to monitor the event. The festival was supposed to take place from 2 p.m. (8 a.m. ET) to midnight. By the evening, the entrance and adjacent roadway remained closed. Thousands inside the venue continued dancing, but many could be seen leaving the area. The Love Parade was first held in the German capital, Berlin, in 1989. CNN's Claudia Otto and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Many"" injured, including some who were airlifted to hospitals around the country .

"(CNN) -- The noisy horns were one of the biggest talking points of the 2010 World Cup, but vuvuzelas are unlikely to take hold in British football stadiums in the upcoming season. Eight English Premier League clubs have banned the South African instruments ahead of the August 14 kick-off of the 2010-11 campaign, calling them potential weapons, annoyances and a health risk. Champions League qualifiers Tottenham were the first in the top flight to outlaw the droning plastic trumpets, following in the footsteps of several lower-league clubs. ""Following discussions with the police and representatives from the local licensing authorities, the club will not be permitting vuvuzelas or similar instruments into White Hart Lane on match days,"" the Londoners said on their website. ""We are concerned that the presence of the instruments within the stadium pose unnecessary risks to public safety and could impact on the ability of all supporters to hear any emergency safety announcements. The best and worst of South Africa 2010 . ""We are very proud of the fantastic atmosphere that our supporters produce organically at White Hart Lane and we are all very much looking forward to this continuing into the forthcoming season."" London rivals Arsenal swiftly followed suit. ""Further to their hugely debated involvement at this summer's World Cup finals in South Africa, Arsenal Football Club has decided to forbid the use of vuvuzelas within Emirates Stadium with immediate effect,"" read a statement. ""This decision has been taken to ensure the enjoyment and safety of supporters on match-days, which is of paramount importance to the club."" UAE places noise lid on vuvuzelas . Another London club, West Ham, said vuvuzelas were ruled out under the health and safety regulations of their Upton Park stadium, which already bars musical bands. ""We would not allow them into the stadium as they could be considered a weapon and could also be considered to be an annoyance to others,"" read a Hammers statement. ""The health and safety regulation that all of this comes under is already in place. The club wishes at all times to ensure that all supporters are allowed to enjoy the game they are watching and prides itself on the passionate, loud and robust support from our fans at all matches at Upton Park."" History of the vuvuzela . Sunderland said it had similar policies about musical instruments at the Stadium of Light, while Liverpool, Birmingham, Everton and Fulham have also banned vuvuzelas. However, the English Football Association has no plans to stop fans taking the horns to the national stadium Wembley, the UK Press Association reported on Wednesday. England play Hungary in an international friendly there on August 11, while the traditional season curtain-raiser, the Community Shield, will take place at the London venue three days earlier. Shock, horror... the vuvuzela goes global! English Premier League and FA Cup winners Chelsea will take on second-placed Manchester United. Chelsea will likely be without goalkeeper Petr Cech, who suffered a calf injury in training on Tuesday. The Czech Republic international is expected to be sidelined for about a month.","Eight English Premier League clubs ban vuvuzelas from their stadiums ahead of new season .

"(CNN) -- The death toll from a cholera outbreak in Haiti has risen to more than 330, and officials believe Hurricane Tomas may worsen the situation as it approaches, a U.N. spokeswoman said Saturday. The number of confirmed cholera cases has climbed to 4,764, with 337 deaths, said Imogen Wall, spokeswoman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Haiti, citing information provided by the Haitian government. Those numbers represent the people that were able to make it to the hospital, she said. Another 200 cases are suspected in the nation's West Department, or province, she said. What is cholera? Tracking maps show Hurricane Tomas nearing Haiti on Thursday as a Category 3 hurricane. U.N. peacekeepers said Thursday that preliminary tests on a suspected source of the cholera outbreak were negative. The U.N. mission in Haiti is testing waste and sewage water at the back of a Nepalese military base that is part of the U.N. operations. The first tests showed no signs of cholera, officials said earlier this week. The mission said it ""has taken very seriously the allegations that sewage water coming from latrines at the back of the Nepalese military base in Mirebalais could be the source of the cholera outbreak in Haiti."" Cholera cases up worldwide . Suspicions about the Nepalese base arose from reports that water was collecting at the back of the base. It was believed to be overflow from the latrine or a septic tank. U.N. engineers examined the base and concluded that the standing water was not from the latrine of septic tank, but from a soak pit that receives water from the kitchen and the shower area, the U.N mission said. ""This soak pit is located three meters from the latrines, hence misleading passers-by into believing that the soaked ground close to latrines is caused by the overspill of human waste,"" it said. All human waste from the camp is collected in seven septic tanks that are emptied out and discharged in a local landfill as authorized by the local government, the United Nations said. The agency also noted that all 710 Nepalese soldiers underwent medical tests, and tested negative for cholera, before deployment to Haiti earlier this month.","The death toll from a cholera outbreak is 337 .

"(CNN) -- Toby Keith opened his seventh Toby Keith's I Love This Bar & Grill in suburban Detroit earlier this month as the latest in a long line of celebrities who've tried to sell a meal with their A-, B- or C-list name. Many celebrities invest in restaurants -- Ashton Kutcher, Britney Spears, Justin Timberlake, to name a few -- they just don't always put their name above the door. The celebrity moniker can be both a blessing and a curse when it comes to starting a restaurant. For every Kenny Rogers Roasters -- which at one point boasted 350 franchises -- there is a Mickey Rooney's Delicious, Mickey Rooney's Weenie World or Mickey Rooney's Star-B-Q. Remember them? Neither does anyone else. ""There's definitely value in a popular celebrity's name,"" Laurie Jacobson, author of  ""Dishing Hollywood,"" tells CNN. ""So if someone is well-liked by the fans, seeing the celebrity's name above the door of a restaurant just might make you go in."" The eponymous celebrity restaurant has its roots at the beginning of the Hollywood movie industry. In the 1920s and '30s, stars such as Frances X. Bushman, Clara Bow and Selma Todd lent their names to eateries. ""It"" girl Bow was so famous, she called her restaurant simply ""It Café."" ""Most people didn't have to be told who the 'It' girl was,"" Jacobson says. And just like today, scandal could destroy a celebrity's restaurant. Fatty Arbuckle's Plantation Restaurant crashed and burned along with his acting career following allegations of rape and murder by the portly comedian. He ""was eventually acquitted, but not in time to save his career,"" Jacobson says. In those early days, the star who had his or her name on the menu was often in the joint, available to sit and have a drink with other famous pals. By the 1950s and '60s, though, celebrity restaurants became more business ventures than vanity vehicles. Dean Martin licensed his name for Dino's Lodge on the Sunset Strip. ""Celebrities' names were slapped up on signs but they were rarely seen in those establishments and it was simply the name value that they hoped would draw in that celebrity's fans or tourists who hoped to see other celebrities there,"" Jacobson says. Then there are those celebrities who've extended their time in the limelight with an eatery. The skipper from ""Gilligan's Island"" greeted guests at Alan Hale's Lobster Barrel and Steak House, and vaudevillian Dave Chasen's chili recipe launched his career as a restaurateur in Beverly Hills, Jacobson says. The allure continues to reel in diners, hungry for a star sighting, be it fans of Toby Keith or Carlos Mencia. ""Sometimes it's just the thrill of grabbing that ashtray, that book of matches,"" Jacobson says. ""And isn't it more fun to go back to Iowa and say I ate at [so-and-so's] restaurant instead of saying I ate at an Italian restaurant? It just gives it a little more oomph.""","Celebrities and restaurants are a good business mix .

"(CNN) -- A federal appeals court has ordered a judge to rethink a ruling that would have led to the execution of a California inmate. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruling, released late Monday night, says a U.S. District Court must now set a hearing to determine the fate of death row inmate Albert Greenwood Brown. The ruling may delay Brown's execution that was scheduled for Thursday. Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for raping and murdering a high school student. His execution would be the first in California since 2006, when legal challenges arose and prompted the state to revise its lethal injection procedure. The federal appeals court said a U.S. District Court made a mistake when it recently said that Brown should choose between a one-drug or a three-drug option for his lethal injection. ""The district court's decision to provide Brown the choice of a one drug option is not consistent with California state law and procedures,"" the court ruling said.  ""California law does not provide the condemned a choice between a three-drug protocol or a one-drug option."" The ruling was not meant to decide Brown's guilt or innocence, but only was considering the ""narrow issue of the manner and timing of Brown's execution in a fashion that comports with the Eighth Amendment's protection against cruel and unusual punishment,"" the federal appeals court said. The ruling could also delay Brown's execution for some time because California is running low on one of the drugs that is used in lethal injection. The state's supply of sodium thiopental is set to expire on October 1 and will not be avaliable until early next year, the appeals court said. Brown was sentenced to death in 1982 for the rape and murder of Susan Jordan, who was walking to Arlington High School in Riverside when Brown pulled her into an orange grove, according to court documents. He raped and strangled her with her own shoelace and took her school identification cards and books. Later that evening, Brown looked up her family in the phone book and called their home, the documents state. ""Hello, Mrs. Jordan, Susie isn't home from school yet, is she?"" court documents quoted him as saying. ""You will never see your daughter again. You can find her body on the corner of Victoria and Gibson."" He also placed a call to police directing them to her body. During the investigation, three witnesses identified Brown as being near the scene of the crime. Police also found Susan's school books and newspaper articles about her death in Brown's home, and clothing with semen stains in Brown's work locker. During the penalty phase of Brown's trial, his lawyer claimed his client was remorseful and presented psychiatric evidence suggesting that Brown had emotional problems, including sexual maladjustment and dysfunction. The jury deliberated for three hours before returning a death verdict, according to an opinion issued September 19 by the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. California's last execution was on January 17, 2006, when Clarence Ray Allen was put to death for three counts of first-degree murder with special circumstances. From behind bars, he had helped orchestrate a deadly armed robbery at a convenience store. CNN's Bill Mears, Augie Martin and Emanuella Grinberg contributed to this report.","If it proceeds, the execution will be the first since a lethal injection review .

"Delta Junction, Alaska (CNN) -- The Trans-Alaska Pipeline, 800 miles long and carrying an estimated 650,000 barrels of oil a day, sweeps majestically over the fast-flowing Tanana River here. For most of its 33-year history, the pipeline has done its work well. It survived an earthquake and even a 2001 attack by a deranged man who pumped six high-powered bullets into its skin. But a little-publicized accident over the Memorial Day weekend has triggered a wave of concern among congressional investigators and led to accusations that Alyeska, the oil company consortium that manages the pipeline, is cutting maintenance and safety budgets. According to pipeline critics, those cuts could endanger the entire system and one day lead to a spill that would shatter Alaska's fragile ecosystems. ""There's incident after incident within the last six months (that) might seem like small things, but when you put them all together, in a relatively short period of time, it really tells you how poorly this pipeline is being maintained,"" Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Michigan, told CNN in an interview to air on tonigh't ""AC360"" Stupak said the biggest and most troubling incident by far was a shutdown of the pipeline caused when both the main power and the backup power failed during a routine systems test at a spot called Pump Station 9, about 10 miles from Delta Junction. It's one of 12 pumping stations between Prudhoe Bay on Alaska's North Slope and the oil terminus at Valdez. Stupak said no one from Alyeska noticed because Pump Station 9 was unmanned -- part of a plan by the pipeline operator to reduce manpower. With no power to control the oil flow, the result, company officials acknowledged, was a spill of tens of thousands of barrels of oil into a so-called capture tank. About 5,000 barrels then leaked onto the ground nearby. CNN was told by Alyeska's chief of security in Fairbanks that a crew could videotape Pump Station 9 from the company parking lot so long as they ventured no farther. When the team from CNN's Special Investigations Unit arrived, however, security personnel stopped them at the entrance about 10 yards from the highway. A guard said he had received instructions to stop them, and he didn't allow CNN access. Later, Alyeska Vice President of Operations Mike Joynor told CNN that he was unaware of the incident. As for the spill, he said Alyeska was still investigating why the power failed. Joynor said the company also was in the midst of developing recommendations to ensure the power failure would not be repeated. But he told CNN those steps would not be made public. According to Alaska state Rep. David Guttenberg, who once worked as a construction worker for Alyeska, the company also wants to move its most valuable engineers and safety experts to company headquarters in Anchorage, far from the pipeline. They now work in Fairbanks, much closer to any potential pipeline spill. ""The e-mails we've been receiving, the fact that Alyeska is moving people away from their posts where they should be out in the field, 350 miles away to an office building in Anchorage, creates a problem of proximity to their work,"" Guttenberg said. And one Alyeska source told CNN that a backlog of deferred maintenance, year after year, is the real problem. That backlog is creating what the source called a ""bow wave"" of repairs that will some day soon cause a cascade of safety and integrity concerns to hit the Trans-Alaska Pipeline. BP is the dominant partner in Alyeska, controlling 46.3 percent of its budget. It is the dominant partner in the relationship, according to Richard Fineberg, who has served four Alaska governors as an oil and gas advisor and says BP's insistence on cost-cutting has influenced the pipeline consortium. Alyeska CEO Kevin Hostler, a former BP executive, announced his early retirement in July after being severely criticized by Stupak. But Joynor told CNN that even though the company's two most recent presidents have come from BP, there is no undue influence from the company, now under fire for its handling of the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico. And Alyeska says its maintenance budgets fall ""within industry standards"" and that it is ""routine practice"" to defer some maintenance items for the succeeding budget year. Joynor said the pipeline is safe and secure and told CNN that the planned movement of personnel involves only office staff, not ""first responders,"" as he put it. He said the pipeline is safe, and he was not under pressure to cut costs. ""We stick to what our core values are: Safety, integrity, environmental protection and protection of a safe work force,"" Joynor said.","A remote spill dumped 5,000 barrels of crude from the pipeline in May .

"(Mental Floss) -- 1. Flower-Flavored PEZ® . There are some foods that people would eat only if they were stranded on a deserted island. No, that's not a typo. Although it would be equally disgusting, we're talking about flower, not flour. Introduced in the late 1960's, flower-flavored PEZ was designed to appeal to the hippie generation -- complete with a groovy, psychedelic dispenser. But even in the decade of free love, no love could be found for the flavor power of flower. Floral scents make for great perfume, but nobody eats perfume, and apparently, there's a reason why. The flower version flopped, and became the next addition to PEZ's long and disturbing list of flavor failures. Since its introduction in 1927, the company has also sold (however briefly) coffee, licorice, eucalyptus, menthol, and cinnamon flavors. 2. 'I Hate Peas!' For as long as children have been shoving Brussels sprouts under mashed potatoes and slipping green beans to the dog, parents have been hunting desperately for a way to end the vegetable discrimination. Finally, in the 1970's, American Kitchen Foods, Inc. came to the rescue (or at least tried) with the release of ""I Hate Peas!"" Since kids love French fries so much, the company decided that disguising peas in a fry-shaped form was a sure-fire way to trick tots into getting their vitamins. Not a chance. Children all over America saw through the ruse. After all, a pea is a pea is a pea, and the name of the product was more than apropos, no matter what it looked like. There were other thinly disguised vegetables in the company's ""I Hate"" line, but kids hated those, too. 3. Reddi-Bacon . Any company smart enough to bless mankind with sprayable whipped cream -- the sort that promotes direct-to-mouth feeding -- has got to know a thing or two about immediate gratification. But sadly, the makers of Reddi-wip® were unable to meld their keen understanding of human laziness with one of processed meat. They figured, if you're cooking breakfast in the morning and you've got a hankering for bacon, why dirty up a pan you'll only have to clean later? The solution: foil-wrapped Reddi-Bacon you could pop into your toaster for piping-hot pork in minutes. It seemed perfect for the busy 1970's household, and what's more, the stuff actually tasted pretty good. Too bad the absorbent pad intended to soak up the dripping grease tended to leak, creating not only a fire hazard, but also a messy (if not totally ruined) toaster. Ultimately, the product lasted about as long as it took to cook; the company scrapped it before it went to market nationwide. 4. Coffee-flavored JELL-O® . In 1918, the makers of JELL-O introduced a new flavor: coffee. Its release was ostensibly based on the logic that, since lots of people like to drink coffee with dessert, they'd be game for combining the two after-dinner treats. Not the case. The company soon realized if anyone wants dessert coffee, they're going to have a cup of it. In fact, if anyone wants coffee at all, they're going to have a cup of it. Not surprisingly, this realization came about the time they yanked the product off the shelves. All in all, it hasn't harmed the company too much. At least they learned their lesson, right? Wrong. Cola-flavored JELL-O was sold for about a year starting in 1942, and for a brief while, the clear, wiggly dessert was sold in celery and chocolate flavors, too. 5. Heublein's Wine & Dine . In the mid-1970's, Heublein introduced Wine & Dine, an upscale, easy-to-make dinner that included a small bottle of vino. How refined. How decadent. How confusing. Consumers knew Heublein for their liquor and wines, so how were they supposed to know the wine included in Wine & Dine was an ingredient for the pasta sauce? Hasty consumers who didn't read the directions closely ended up pouring the contents of the bottle into a nice glass and getting a less-than-pleasant mouthful of salted wine. 6. Funky Fries . While Americans aren't always fond of the French, they do love their French fries. In 2002, hoping to follow the success of Heinz's new ""kiddie"" ketchup versions (in green and purple), Ore-Ida introduced Funky Fries: chocolate-flavored, cinnamon-flavored, and blue-colored French fries. An awful lot of money was sunk into the product, but after a year of marketing, consumers still found the idea funky -- in the bad way. Funky Fries were pulled off the shelves in 2003, and images of blue fries with green ketchup were once again relegated to the world of Warhol-esque pop art. 7. Pepsi A.M. Creating a super-caffeinated soda worked well for the makers of Red Bull, but not for the folks at Pepsi. With 25 percent more caffeine than a cup of Joe, PepsiCo introduced the cola-flavored product in 1989, only to discover that most people just couldn't bring themselves to drink soda with their cornflakes. For those who wanted a Pepsi in the morning, regular Pepsi did just fine, thankyouverymuch. Pepsi A.M., like the coffee-flavored Pepsi Kona before it, was scrapped after just a few months. 8. Gerber Singles . At some point in time, almost every adult has tasted baby food and discovered that the stuff isn't half bad. But that doesn't mean people want to make a meal out of it. For some reason, Gerber had to learn that lesson the hard way. In 1974, the company released Gerber Singles, small servings of food meant for single adults, packaged in jars that were almost identical to those used for baby food. It didn't take long for Gerber execs to figure out that most consumers, unless they were less than a year old, couldn't get used to eating a pureed meal out of a jar -- particularly one depressingly labeled ""Singles."" Baby food for grown-ups was pulled from the marketplace shortly after its birth. E-mail to a friend . For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com .

"(CNN) -- Appreciate the apostrophe, salute the semicolon and exalt the exclamation point Friday. It's National Punctuation Day! The holiday started when Jeff Rubin, a newsletter publisher and former reporter, grew increasingly frustrated as he spotted errors in the newspaper. ""I would sit at the kitchen table with my red Sharpie ... screaming obscenities, which would upset my wife,"" says Rubin, 60. ""She encouraged me to find another outlet for my aggravation."" In 2004, he secured a listing for the day in the ""Chase's Calendar of Events"" reference book, and National Punctuation Day was born. This year marks its seventh official celebration. ""The first two years it was on August 22, because that's my birthday,"" Rubin says. ""I figured if you're going to start a holiday, you should have it on a day you can remember."" But he moved the festivities to September 24 in 2006, placing it squarely in the school year and honoring the number of his favorite baseball hero, Willie Mays. The day isn't just for people who get cranky over misplaced commas or hyperventilate over errant hyphens. Rubin says he wanted to help educators remind students that punctuation still matters, even in an age of rapid-fire tweets and text messages. ""We are graduating children from high schools now who cannot read and cannot write,"" he says. ""When these kids get out into the real world, they're going to be unemployable."" Rubin says thousands of parents, teachers, attorneys and human resources managers have signed up for his newsletter, ""The Exclamation Point!"" He's not alone in his push for punctuation. ""'Let's eat Grandma!' or, 'Let's eat, Grandma!' Punctuation saves lives,"" proclaims a Facebook group that has more than 800,000 followers. And in her book, ""Eats, Shoots & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation,"" British author Lynne Truss describes a panda entering a cafe, eating a sandwich, firing a gun and walking out -- all because of a poorly punctuated wildlife manual. Rubin, who lives in a suburb of San Francisco, California, also takes an irreverent approach. His website features photos of prominent punctuation gaffes and a recipe for meatloaf that can be sculpted to look like exclamation points and semicolons. Last year, a baking contest inspired schools to celebrate with pepperoni bread shaped like parentheses and cookies shaped like question marks, Rubin says. This year, a teacher in Illinois has asked her students to write haiku. For people outside the classroom, this Friday offers another excuse to practice proper punctuation: it's also Love Note Day.","National Punctuation Day is September 24 .

"(CNN) -- A majority of cocaine imported into Australia over the past two years came from Mexico, the Australian Crime Commission told CNN in a statement Thursday. ""This is in part due to the strong links ethnic South Americans and Mexicans have with cocaine producers in Colombia, Bolivia and Peru,"" the commission said. The intelligence came from a ""comprehensive national picture of the overall illicit drug market,"" which involved data collected by a multitude of agencies, according to the statement. Although the statement stopped short of naming the specific organized crime connection between Australia and Mexico, they said, ""opportunities brought by technology, by globalization ... and new information, brings with it opportunities for crime that were previously unimaginable."" ""We are also seeing more dispersed criminal networks,"" the statement said. ""In addition, it may indicate more networking by criminal groups who are effectively subcontracting distribution rather than take the entire risk."" Cocaine consumption in Australia is increasing, according to authorities, with a total of 359 importations detected between 2008 and 2009. ""Recent increases in cocaine arrests and reported use, as well as considerable seizures of the drug in recent years indicate potential expansion of the Australia cocaine market,"" the statement said.","Cocaine consumption in Australia is increasing .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- As an umbrella group of humanitarian entities called for ""urgent international support"" Monday in flood-ravaged Pakistan, the United States was sending materials to provide shelter for almost 47,000 displaced Pakistanis. The U.S. Embassy said that a cargo aircraft carrying 530 rolls of heavy-duty waterproof and fire-resistant plastic sheeting for use as temporary shelters was sent by the United States to Karachi, Pakistan, on Monday, a day after another flight ferried 240 rolls of plastic sheeting to Karachi. ""Our experience has shown that plastic sheeting is urgently needed for temporary shelters, and we know it is urgently needed in Sindh as the flood waters continue to move south,"" Ambassador Anne Patterson said in a written statement.  ""It will be supplied along with locally purchased materials that can be easily moved when people are able to return home."" The embassy said the sheeting material will provide dry shelter for 46,800 people in Sindh province. It was going to a logistics hub in Sindh for distribution by local and international organizations. To date, the United States has committed approximately $76 million for Pakistan emergency flood relief assistance. But the overall global response has not been nearly enough, according to an International Rescue Committee-chaired consortium called the Pakistan Humanitarian Forum. About $150 million had been received from nations around the world by Monday, the group said in a news release, but much more is needed. ""The international response to the disaster has been too small to even begin to effectively address the needs of survivors,"" said Tammy Hasselfeldt, the country director of the International Rescue Committee, in the release. ""The most urgent priority is to ensure that safe water as well as medicines are available, food supplies are restored and transportation networks fixed to accelerate the delivery of desperately needed aid."" John Holmes, the emergency relief coordinator for the United Nations, acknowledged Monday that the international community is just beginning to recognize the massive need in the flood-ravaged country. ""We know full well we have a lot of people still to reach, a huge distance still to go to make the assistance meet the need,"" he said. ""That's why we've appealed for $460 million, and I'm glad to say the international response is beginning to come in."" However, he warned that ""we need to see more -- we need to see a response that is commensurate with the size of the disaster that we're seeing."" He noted that while the need is beginning to be recognized, ""unfortunately, the need is still rising because the floods are still rising in some parts of the country."" Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gilani said Saturday that as many as 20 million of his countrymen have been affected by the flooding. The Pakistan Humanitarian Forum put the number at 14 million on Monday. The death toll from the flooding that's raged more than a fortnight is up to 1,463, and more than 2,000 people have been injured, the National Disaster Management Authority said Sunday. With about one-fifth of the country underwater, almost 900,000 homes have been damaged, the agency said. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said Sunday that while he has visited sites of natural disasters around the world, he has never seen anything like the devastation created by flooding in Pakistan. He said the disaster is worse than the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami and the 2005 Pakistani earthquake combined. ""Thousands of towns and villages have simply been washed away,"" Ban said, speaking alongside Pakistan President Asif Ali Zardari. ""Roads, buildings, bridges, crops -- millions of livelihoods have been lost. People are marooned on tiny islands with the flood waters all around them. They are drinking dirty water. They are living in the mud and ruins of their lives. Many have lost family and friends. Many more are afraid their children and loved ones will not survive in these conditions."" Water-borne bacteria and illness have become serious concerns. At least 36,000 cases of acute watery diarrhea have been reported, the United Nation's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs said in Islamabad on Saturday. Up to 3.5 million children are at high risk of deadly waterborne diseases including watery diarrhea and dysentery, which cause dehydration, said Maurizio Giuliano of the humanitarian affairs office. Children also are at risk for typhoid and hepatitis A and E, Giuliano said. Clean water is an urgent need, but UNICEF cannot reach all those in need due to a serious lack of funds, Giuliano said. Medication is a priority, but funding shortages hamper the work of the World Health Organization even though plans are in place. Lack of proper food increases vulnerability, the United Nations said. President Zardari said his nation needs more international help to deal with the immediate recovery efforts as well as longer-term reconstruction and infrastructure development, according to spokesman Farhatullah Babar. Ban said he is allocating a further $10 million from the U.N.'s Central Emergency Response Fund, making $27 million allocated since the crisis began. According to ReliefWeb.int, more than two dozen countries, organizations and individuals have pledged about $305 million. Ban and Zardari have made a public plea to the international community to increase aid.

"Paris, France (CNN) -- Two members of the French national soccer team, Franck Ribery and Karim Benzema, were being questioned by French police Tuesday in connection with an alleged underage prostitution ring, French police said. Ribery, who also plays for German team Bayern Munich, and Benzema, who plays for Spanish side Real Madrid, were being questioned by a police brigade that specializes in surveillance of prostitution. The case emerged earlier this year after police raided a night club near the Champs Elysees in Paris and detained 18 girls on suspicion of prostitution. One of the girls, Zahia Dehar, appeared on the cover of Paris Match in April and told the magazine she had sexual relations with several players on the national team, including Ribery, whom she had met at the club. She said in the interview she hadn't told them she was younger than 18 at the time. In an initial court hearing on the case, Ribery admitted he had sex with Dehar but insisted he did not know she was a minor. Benzema has made no public comment. Neither of the players spoke to reporters Tuesday. A lawyer for Ribery said outside the police station where the players were questioned that her client had done nothing wrong, and that he would have had to have known the girl's real age in order for it to be an intentional offense. The questioning adds to a disastrous summer for the French national squad, which crashed out of the World Cup in the first round following two draws and a defeat that left them at the bottom of their group of teams. It was an embarrassing exit for the team that had reached the final of the last World Cup, in 2006. Forward Nicolas Anelka was sent home from the tournament after an argument with coach Raymond Domenech, causing the rest of the French players to refuse to show up for training. French team director Jean-Louis Valentin publicly announced his resignation to the media, and team captain Patrice Evra -- who had publicly argued with the team's fitness coach during training -- was omitted from the team's match with South Africa. Once the team arrived back in France, striker Thierry Henry spoke to French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and French lawmakers grilled outgoing coach Domenech about the events.","Franck Ribery, Karim Benzema questioned by French police .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is happy to stay with the English Premier League side after reported interest from Spanish giants Real Madrid. Gerrard's future was the subject of much speculation after Liverpool finished seventh last season and failed to qualify for the lucrative European Champions League. The 30-year-old delayed any decision until after the World Cup, where he captained England to a disappointing second round exit at the hands of Germany. He was linked with a move to Jose Mourinho's Real Madrid but he has underlined his commitment to Liverpool after a private meeting with manager Roy Hodgson, who took over from Rafael Benitez earlier this month. Gerrard told Liverpool's official website: ""I made it clear that I simply needed to concentrate on the World Cup and then have a decent holiday with my family. ""I wanted the chance to meet Roy Hodgson privately and having done so I'm very impressed with his plans for the future of the team. ""I've only returned to training on Tuesday with some of the other World Cup players, but I can't wait for the new season to start."" Gerrard's declaration -- just a day after Liverpool announced the capture of England international Joe Cole -- was welcomed by Hodgson, who is also hoping to persuade Spain striker Fernando Torres to remain at the club. ""It's a great piece of news,"" Hodgson said. ""There won't be anyone in Liverpool who isn't delighted to hear that. I'm really pleased about it because I've got great respect for Steven Gerrard. ""He's a player who I was really looking forward to working with when I came to Liverpool. It seems now with that commitment that this will happen. ""It gives everyone a boost without question. It will be a tough season, with a lot of matches and the disappointment of last season is going to take a while to dissipate, but it is very good that our best player is still going to be playing at this club. ""Hopefully with the signing of Joe Cole -- and if we are lucky one or two others, to boost the squad -- we will be going into this season's competition, maybe stronger on paper than we were last season."" Gerrard said Cole was a ""great signing"" for the club. ""I know Joe well through the England set-up and have seen first hand just how good a player he is. ""He's proved his ability over many years in the Premier League, sometimes against us - so it will be fantastic to play alongside him in a red shirt for Liverpool. ""I've told him what a great club this is and I'm sure Joe's the sort of exciting talent our fans will love to see.""","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard says he is happy to stay at the club .

"(CNN) -- Iggy Pop invented punk rock. That's how cool he is. His songs have been covered by the likes of Guns N' Roses, REM, The Red Hot Chili Peppers and The Sex Pistols. Iggy Pop: The wildest man in rock music. He is the wildest wild man of rock and his four-decade career has been marked by drug addiction, self mutilation and onstage nudity -- and at 61 years old he is showing no signs of growing old gracefully. Born on April 21, 1947, in Muskegon, Michigan, James Newell Osterberg grew up in a trailer park. When he began learning the drums as a teenager his parents gave up their bedroom to house his drum kit. It wasn't long before he took his talent out of the bedroom, playing with high-school band The Iguanas, from which he later took his stage name. After graduating from high school in 1965, Iggy formed a blues band called the Prime Movers. Following a brief stint at the University of Michigan he moved to Chicago, playing drums with local bluesmen, before returning to Michigan with his sights set on fronting a rock band.  Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami » . In 1967, he recruited guitarist Ron Asheton, his drummer brother Scott Asheton and bassist Dave Alexander and formed The Psychedelic Stooges. It was after seeing the Doors in concert, and inspired by Jim Morrison's confrontational stage persona, that James Osterberg reinvented himself as Iggy Pop, a drug-fueled, crazed whirling dervish of a front man, who would strut semi-naked around the stage, roll around in broken glass and dive headlong into the audience. The band shortened its name to The Stooges and released its eponymous debut in 1969. Right from the start there was clearly something different about Iggy Pop. At the height of flower power, when The Stooges' contemporaries were singing about peace and love, Iggy was singing ""No Fun"" and ""I Wanna Be Your Dog.""  See photos of Iggy in action. » . The album was a brilliant mess of raw, blues-influenced garage rock, but it sold poorly, as did the 1970 follow up ""Fun House,"" later described by Jack White of the White Stripes as ""the definitive rock album of America."" Watch Iggy Pop show CNN around Miami . By this time, Iggy had begun the Heroin use that would plague his career and in 1971, The Stooges split up after being dropped by their record label. That same year, Iggy met David Bowie, who took him to England, re-united The Stooges and produced 1973's ""Raw Power."" With ""Raw Power,"" Iggy and the Stooges created the blueprint for punk rock and made an album that would one day be regarded as a landmark in rock music, an album that Nirvana singer Kurt Cobain listed as his favorite of all time. Nonetheless, it was another commercial failure and in 1974, The Stooges split again. By this time, Heroin had taken over Iggy's life and in 1975 he checked himself into a Los Angeles mental institution in an effort to kick the habit. Bowie visited him there and took Iggy along on his 1976 tour, before the pair moved to West Berlin in an effort to get away from the temptation of drugs. It was there that Bowie produced and co-wrote Iggy's 1977 solo albums, ""The Idiot"" and ""Lust for Life."" The latter included the songs ""The Passenger"" and ""Lust for Life,"" which have since become staples of TV ads and movie soundtracks, spawning countless cover versions. More commercial than The Stooges' records, Iggy's solo albums were met with critical acclaim and better sales, but never breakthrough into the mainstream. Songs that Bowie wrote with Iggy during this period were later included on Bowie albums, with ""China Girl"" becoming a hit single for Bowie. Iggy carried on touring and releasing albums throughout the 80s, without much commercial success, although the single ""Real Wild Child"" was a hit in the U.S. and UK. But by the end of the decade, Iggy was beginning to be recognized as ""the Godfather of Punk,"" with a new generation of bands citing him as an influence. Members of Guns N' Roses and the B52s appeared on his 1990 album ""Brick by Brick,"" which sold more than 500,000 copies, and his 2003 album ""Skull Ring"" featured the likes of Green Day, Sum 41 and Peaches. But what really made ""Skull Ring"" special was that it re-united Iggy with Ron and Scott Asheton of The Stooges. After years on the periphery, Iggy was suddenly fashionable, with the reformed Stooges appearing at festivals all over the world. The band recorded the album ""The Weirdness"" in 2007, but it was their astonishingly powerful live performances that showed why they were still such a big deal 40 years after they started out. Any hopes Iggy may have had for a peaceful retirement in Miami have been dashed. At 61 years old he is still performing with the same energy and abandon as when The Stooges first formed, with only marginally less stage diving and nudity. It seems that the world has finally caught up with Iggy Pop, the most exciting, unpredictable and entertaining man in rock.","Iggy Pop and The Stooges produced three classic albums in the 60s and 70s .

"(CNN)  -- A consortium of wealthy city businessmen is poised to make an audacious takeover bid for English Premier League champions Manchester United. The self-styled ""Red Knights"" issued a statement on Tuesday to confirm that they had held talks about ousting the current American owners, the Glazer family, to assume control at Old Trafford. The Red Knights include Jim O'Neill, the chief economist at Goldman Sachs, who is reportedly a friend of Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson. ""We can confirm that a group of high net worth individuals, who support Manchester United met in London yesterday,"" a statement released on behalf of the Red Knights read. ""This group is supportive of current management but are looking at the feasibility of putting together a proposal to be put to the Glazer family regarding the ownership of Manchester United. ""These discussions are in early stages and no contact has been made with the Glazer family."" The Red Knights are joining forces with the influential Manchester United Supporters Trust (MUST), who have mounted a vociferous campaign against the Glazers over their debt leveraged buyout of the club and fears about its future viability. The current level of debt stands at $1,089 million and the Glazers recently launched a bond issue to raise $750 million to reduce the debt. Football floats on a sea of debt . ""As a first step, the Red Knights want supporters to demonstrate their commitment by joining the free online membership of the Supporters Trust, www.joinmust.org,"" the statement went on. ""Any new ownership model would aim not only to put the club on a sound financial footing, but would also aim to put the supporters at the heart of everything the club does."" In recent weeks a groundswell of opinion has built up against the Glazers, who are rarely seen in public but did attend the English League Cup final at Wembley on Sunday as Manchester United beat Aston Villa 2-1. They would have seen a large body of fans donning the original green and gold shirts of United's founding club Newton Heath, one of the trademarks of the Supporters Trust campaign. Oliver Houston, a vice-chairman of MUST, told CNN World Sport that the Red Knights had their unequivocal backing and that his group had been involved in a series of meetings with them. ""These guys are Manchester United supporters to the core and they are talking about putting in their own money in any possible bid,"" he said. Houston admitted that the Red Knights are at the ""early stages"" but had appointed a team of lawyers and advisers to bolster their activities. ""We are talking about the long term health and sustainability of Manchester United,"" he added. But the Red Knights will need to raise at least $1.52 billion to launch a buyout of the most successful club in the English Premier League, Drew Barrand from Sport Industry Group told World Sport. The Glazers reacted quickly to news of the putative bid. ""Manchester United is not for sale,"" said a spokesman for the family, who also own the NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers. The statement of intent by the Red Knights comes on the day that the latest football ""rich list"", compiled by Deloitte, found that Manchester United had slipped to third place behind Spanish giants Real Madrid and Barcelona. Real Madrid top rich list . The list excludes transfer fees and is based on turnover and income and United's slippage to third can, in part, be explained by the fall of the English pound against the euro. Real and Barcelona also benefit from negotiating their own television rights package while United are tied into the collective deal put in place by the English Premier League, but the statistics could give added justification for a takeover bid.","A group of 'high net worth individuals' consider takeover bid for Manchester United .

"Kalam, Pakistan (CNN) -- If you've ever been on the subway during rush hour in one of the world's major cities you will understand how crammed the U.S. Army Chinook was taking off from the flood ravaged town of Kalam in the Swat district of North West Pakistan. Normally the CH-47 Chinooks can carry up to 100 people, but according to a Pakistani officer charged with counting the passengers there were more than 120 on board when Lieutenant Colonel John Knightstep's chopper lifted off. It was another show of how the U.S. military is pushing the boundaries trying to help those who have lost everything in the floods that hit Pakistan more than six weeks ago. ""We're averaging about 200,000 pounds (91,000 kilograms) of aid every day,"" Knightstep said in an interview with CNN. ""We are also helping displaced people, ferrying about 200 per day, if not more."" The U.S. military has 18 helicopters from the 16th Combat Aviation Brigade out of Wainwright, Alaska, flying aid missions to the Swat district of North West Pakistan. The crews will be on missions for about eight hours every day usually flying aid into ravaged towns like Kalam and evacuating residents from the area. The Swat district is considered one of the most beautiful areas in all of Pakistan with mountains almost 20,000 feet high. But the mountainous terrain also makes flying challenging for the crews. ""Some of the areas we fly into are kind of small, because we are landing into villages that don't normally have aircraft traffic. They're not set up to handle aircraft as big as this. So some of the landing sites are kind of small and it is a bit tricky to get several aircraft into there, but you just have to be careful and watch what's around you,"" said warrant officer Aron Cunningham, who flies a CH-47 Chinook. The town of Kalam, one of the main destinations for the aid-carrying U.S. helicopters, was considered one of the prime tourist destinations in Pakistan before the Swat river, which flows through the town, burst its banks on July 29. The rising waters literally tore large chunks out of the city destroying many of the town's prime hotels. ""Seeing the people that we are moving around, seeing the damage that has been done to their villages, they have been cut off from their road network, their access to food and basic supplies, that we tend to take for granted,"" said Cunningham. ""So helping them is certainly a rewarding experience for us."" The U.S. crews even fly produce for farmers in areas cut off from road access so they can get their goods to local markets. Swat also has political significance for the U.S. and Pakistan. Until last year, the district was ruled by militants like the Taliban before the Pakistani military cleared the area, and the population is very distrustful of the United States. So far, however, the troops say they have not seen any hostility from the local people. ""We've had no problems,"" said Knightstep. ""We've had no security issues, it has been safe. They are in need and from what I can see they are extremely happy to see us."" Most of the helicopters flying into the devastated areas are packed with aid as the military is trying to stockpile goods in Kalam and other places that are still cut off. They know once the winter arrives it will often be impossible to fly into Swat, even though, being a unit out of Alaska, the pilots are used to flying in extreme snow conditions. ""In terms of the mountains and the snow this will feel a lot like flying back home,"" said Cunningham as he was steering his Chinook toward a resupply point called Rubicon, where the helicopters are refueled and loaded with aid. The U.S. says the aid flights will continue until the job is done and that could take several months. Pakistani military officials say the chopper crews have been vital to their flood response efforts and have done a lot to improve America's standing in this part of the world.","U.S. military has 18 helicopters flying aid missions to Pakistan's Swat district .

"(CNN) -- Andy Schleck drew a line under his row with leader Alberto Contador after France's Pierrick Fedrigo fought off a challenge from Lance Armstrong to win stage 16 of the Tour de France. Defending champion Contador, from Spain, retained his eight-second lead over Luxembourg's Schleck on Tuesday after the previous day's 'chain reaction' controversy. Contador apologized to his rival after sprinting ahead when Schleck dropped his chain during an attack on the stage's final climb. The Spaniard ignored the Tour's sporting traditions by refusing to wait and was booed by the crowd. After gaining 39 seconds Contador issued an apology on Youtube, while Schleck vowed to take his revenge. Contador learns winning isn't everything . But after finishing the 199.5km stage between Bagnere-de-Luchon and Pau on Tuesday Schleck diffused the situation, turning his attention to Thursday's crucial Tourmalet stage, where he will bid to snatch the lead from Contador. He told the Tour's official website: ""I haven't seen the footage of Alberto's apology but he came to me today and personally apologized and I appreciate that a lot. ""He knows that he made a mistake yesterday; he shouldn't have done that, he knows it and, for me, that's enough now. This case is closed and people should stop with it and move on. Nobody deserves to be chastised endlessly. ""I'm still motivated but it's not like it's revenge. I just want to win this Tour -- that's my goal -- and I know there's only one chance left and that's the Tourmalet [on Thursday]. I think I can do it. I hope I can do it."" Contador added: ""Today I talked with Andy because I wanted to make things clear. We have always had good relations and I do not want them to be damaged by what happened yesterday. ""We have explained ourselves and I think our relationship can become as good as it was before."" Fedrigo, from the Bbox team, outsprinted a seven-strong group, including six-time winner Armstrong, to record his third stage victory on the Tour. See Contador's Youtube apology here . He finished ahead of compatriot Sandy Casar and Spain's Ruben Plaza, while Armstrong took sixth place. It is now five years since the American's last stage victory. Carlos Barredo made the first dash for the line with more than 40km to go in the stage, but he ran out of steam and was caught by Fedrigo's group with a little over 1km to go. As Fedrigo burst from the line Armstrong tried to keep pace but couldn't maintain his challenge. He told reporters afterwards: ""It was harder than I expected. It's been a while since I sprinted and I was just not quick enough."" Fedrigo was delighted with his win. He told the Tour's official website: ""I would have been very disappointed to finish this Tour without finding myself in a position to play to win. I was really afraid of not succeeding. ""The Tour passes so quickly and so far I did not answer the call I'd issued myself. Last night I even cracked a little and my nerves were a bit frayed. But perhaps that's what I needed in order to regain confidence. ""In the end, [Lance] Armstrong told me that he would not cooperate with me because he knew I was the fastest group.""","Luxembourg's Andy Schleck ends his row with Tour de France rival Alberto Contador .

"Copiapo, Chile (CNN) -- A ""Plan C"" oil drill to reach 33 miners trapped in Chile is scheduled to start in earnest early Wednesday amid hopes it will provide a faster solution than the other two methods used. But officials do not know how long it will take the drill, normally used in to drill for oil, to reach the men trapped 700 meters (2,300 feet) underground. By Wednesday afternoon, the Plan C drill reached 40 meters, officials said. The plan is for the new drill to descend vertically for at least 40 meters before turning at an angle to reach the underground ramp that leads to the miners, said Andre Sougarret, manager of the state copper mining company. Sougarret said that attaching directional motors to the drill would slow it to a speed of 1 meter per hour, adding that 20 to 30 meters per day ""would be a good average."" Under optimal conditions, it is capable of drilling 1,000 meters in 24 hours, said Juan Carlos Marin, a site representative for Schlumberger oil services company. Meanwhile, the Plan A drill was 366 meters in, and the Plan B drill, which was widening a hole it made, was at 85 meters, Sougarret said. The Plan B drill was temporarily halted Wednesday after the drill bit came loose and fell down the mine, he said. ""We felt a loss of pressure, and the miners called us to say the bit had fallen into the mine,"" Sougarret said. Officials believe that the malfunction occurred after the drill moved from hard rock to softer material. The bit that fell will remain in the mine, and a spare drill bit will be used, officials said. Government engineers are finalizing designs for three rescue capsules, which will be sent down the completed rescue shaft to extract the miners one by one, according to Sougarret. The capsules will take 10 to 12 days to build. Sougarret said the largest of the miners measures 48 inches around the shoulders. The ""design of the capsule is being completed with this in mind,"" Sougarret said. Despite the fact that Plan C is capable of significantly higher speeds than drills A and B, Sougarret would not move up the expected date of the miners' rescue. ""My sources are the technical indicators, and we are still working toward the beginning of November,"" Sougarret said. Engineers are dealing with hard rock and a much smaller area than they normally encounter, Marin said. ""When we drill for oil, we have a much bigger target area of perhaps 50 or 60 meters. Here we have a margin of error of just 4 meters,"" he said. The need for precision in this drilling operation means the drill will move much more slowly, he said, but he gave no precise predictions. ""If we did not have such a specific objective at 700 meters, then we could do this in two days,"" he said. ""But what changes all this is that we have to reach an objective with precision, and so we do not know how long that could take."" For now, the company has told Chilean officials that it could take 40 days to complete the work, he said. He did not say whether time it took to assemble the rig and drill the pilot hole was included in that time frame. Two other drills are also trying to reach the miners, who have been trapped since the August 5 cave-in. The drills, dubbed Plan A and Plan B, each require two holes to be drilled and have been moving at a rate of 30 or 40 meters a day. Officials are planning how they will bring the miners to the surface once a bore hole is wide enough for the task. The daunting rescue may require an oxygen-fed cage that will haul them up one at a time. Previously, officials have said that the workers could be rescued, if all goes well, in late October or early November. ""When I look at their faces on their video they have sent to the surface, I would love to have them out by tomorrow,"" Marin said. CNN's Esprit Smith and Patrick Oppmann contributed to this report.","The Plan C option is normally used to drill for oil .

"(OPRAH.com) -- Turns out, I am mentally ill. Aspects of my current brain chemistry resemble that of a person with obsessive-compulsive disorder. I haven't started turning the light switches on and off or urgently avoiding sidewalk cracks. But I have been shopping for beauty products and underwear in a fever. I read cookbooks now. I spend an embarrassing amount of time looking at myself naked. My classic symptoms -- involuntary preoccupation, mood swings, emotional sensitivity, enhanced sensual awareness -- are what tip the diagnosis. I am limerent. In the throes of limerence. It is both a psychological and physiological state. It is also the state I wish to call home. Lay terms for limerence: romantic love, crazy love, lovesick, mad love, amour fort. You see a theme in the words crazy, sick, and mad. In this condition, one's body drugs itself mightily with hormones that create a feeling of joy. The rapture is balanced with the panic and dread that it could end. And it will. Limerence has a shelf life. By some estimates, you're lucky to get 18 months. I've had it for a year. When I think of becoming nonlimerent in six months, I suffer stomach pains, headaches, and jitters. Like a junkie. ""You won't have withdrawal symptoms,"" says Dorothy Tennov, Ph.D., author of the groundbreaking 1979 book ""Love and Limerence"" and the woman who originated the term. ""And 18 months sounds short to me. If the limerence is requited, it can last up to three years. But you won't wake up nonlimerent on your anniversary. It's a gradual decline."" Oprah.com: How to make romance last . Helen Fisher, Ph.D., the author of ""Anatomy of Love,"" gives it two years. ""Two, maybe three. During this stage, what I call infatuation, you experience increases of norepinephrine and dopamine levels in the brain and of testosterone, too, since lust is involved,"" she says. ""When you move into the attachment stage, where you see an increase of vasopressin and oxytocin, the other hormones return to normal. Most couples in attached relationships have less sex than those in the infatuation stage."" The phrase addicted to love applies to women and men who crave the excitement (and sex) of infatuation, floating from one intense affair to the next, leaving a pile of heartbroken, attachment-seeking partners in their wake. Once you've transitioned out of infatuation, hormone levels dropping, you either attach or you do the opposite. ""I don't use the word detach in my research,"" Fisher says, ""but that's what happens. When you're heartbroken, hormones change again. You get another dopamine boost. That makes you have no interest in food at the beginning and end of a passionate relationship."" Fisher is wary of presenting a relationship time line by stages. ""You can flow from infatuation to attachment and back again,"" she says. ""Some relationships start with attachment -- a loving friendship -- and then shift to infatuation and lust."" The classic scenario, the only one I've known, is to fall madly in love at the start and eventually settle into a pleasant commitment or suffer a devastating breakup. A comfortable marriage -- been there -- is swell. Attachment is a relief, a safe haven. For most people, the ultimate reward. But I'd rather not contemplate attachment or detachment when the stage I'm in is, as Tennov puts it, ""the greatest joy, the height of euphoria, walking on air."" In my twenties I was always looking ahead, insisting that relationships move forward to be satisfying. My goal then was to progress to marriage. Now, in my late thirties, I try to live in the present. My current goal: Milk the glorious status quo. Six to 12 months of it left. Is there no way to stretch this out? Get more than the allotted couple of years? Oprah.com: How to find love and make it last . ""You know, limerence can be unending,"" Tennov says. ""I've interviewed subjects who've nursed a fixation on their limerence objects -- LOs -- for decades."" What's the trick? ""Their feelings were unrequited,"" she reports. ""Their LOs gave them mixed signals, like ignoring them for months and then calling. Hope, confusion, and uncertainty kept it going. The phenomenon is defined, in part, by feeling a loss of control. The limerent person can't stop thinking about the LO: What did he mean by that? How can I interpret his tone of voice? How is he responding to me? A prolonged fixation on someone who doesn't love you back is considered, by some psychologists, a pathology called erotomania."" But that's not me. ""If the LO is responsive,"" Tennov says, ""like your boyfriend, he doesn't send mixed signals, you don't experience uncertainty, the love is mutual, and limerence declines. Unless you want to start pretending you don't have feelings for him, or playing hard to get, the end will come."" Discouraging news. And then some hope: ""Barriers and hurdles in the relationship lengthen infatuation,"" Fisher says. ""For example, suppose one of you is married. Or one lives in a different city. The struggle is romantic. You say your boyfriend travels a lot for work? That's good. The pain of his leaving and the happiness of his return can prolong the stage."" That could buy me another six months. I explored other adversity options. I've always been skilled at picking fights. ""A fight can intensify the feeling, making you work harder to put things right,"" Fisher says. But beware: Part of infatuation is the joy of discovery. As you learn about the object of your affection, the insights propel you to the next stage. If you love her more for who she really is, enter attachment. Conversely, if she turns out to be a raving, provoking lunatic, detachment would be the wise choice. Effect: Subtract six months of infatuation either way. All pain, no gain. Other factors that subtract from bliss time: chronic irritation, dissimilar interests and goals, sexual dysfunction, antipathy for each other's friends and family, fear of loss of personal freedom and identity, surfacing of past relationship disappointments, inability to argue productively. That's the shortlist (and no wonder the prospect of moving beyond rapture is daunting -- there are so many bubble-puncturing issues). The factor at the top of this list, Fisher says, is ""boredom, lack of novelty. You have to continually have adventures, do new things together. They don't have to be grand or expensive. If you can keep introducing fresh experiences into the relationship, you can lengthen the duration of romantic love or, even better, have a burst of that old feeling within the attachment stage."" Oprah.com: What to do when every little thing he does drives you crazy . My boyfriend and I have loads of good, solid ideas for new things to do together. For instance, he wants to teach me about opera and classical music. Every time we set out to listen, we wind up ignoring the plans and doing the same things we usually do, in the same place, every single night. ""Okay, let's talk about sex,"" Fisher says. ""I want to distinguish lust from infatuation. Having lust doesn't mean you're in love. Many couples start out with lust and then move into infatuation. You can certainly fall in love without sex. But falling in love triggers your sex drive. Suddenly, everything your boyfriend does is sexually attractive. ""You have high levels of dopamine in your brain, and you want it constantly. That may be what you're most afraid of losing, why you want to arrest the infatuation stage."" I admit to nothing. ""You don't have to lose the desire. There are an enormous number of ways you can experiment sexually, and we live in a world where there is a wealth of easily accessible information on how to do that."" So Internet porn might net me another few months of testosterone infusion? Naturally, I'm willing to try anything. Fisher also advocates prolonging infatuation by making improvements in your physical appearance. Perhaps losing ten pounds and washing out my gray hairs will win me another year. Combine that with my boyfriend's frequent flying and our future novel adventures, and I'm ratcheting up my limerence potential to a grand total of five years. The doctors didn't respond favorably to my math. ""You know, some people are never limerent,"" Tennov says. ""We don't know why, but they can't or won't experience the feeling of being madly in love. ""And for the majority of limerent subjects, the feeling is unrequited. They have a horrible time."" ""Leaving one stage is not an end,"" Fisher says. It's a new beginning? ""My point is that relationships can be fluid. You can flow from one stage to another if you're able to put energy and attention into the relationship,"" she says. Of course, you can't flow from detachment back to anything. I suppose you could break up and get back together, but then the love wouldn't have the same blissful optimism. And, Fisher warns, putting too much effort into maintaining the status quo could cause problems (and not the good ""romantic struggle"" kind). Fisher says that I should let the infatuation run its course and enjoy the hell out of it. Who knows? Maybe when it ends, I'll have had enough of it. I'll report back, four years from now.

"(CNN) -- World number one Rafael Nadal recorded his 35th win in 37 matches as he beat big-serving American Taylor Dent at the Cincinnati Masters. The Spaniard triumphed 6-2 7-5 in one hour and 24 minutes to set up a third round clash with Frenchman Julien Benneteau, who beat Stanislas Wawrinka, of Switzerland. Nadal cruised through the first set but had to recover from 4-2 down in the second to prevent a decider. Second seed Novak Djokovic booked his place in the next round with a 6-3 7-5 victory over fellow Serbian Viktor Troicki. Djokovic, who has lost in the final at Cincinnati two years running, will now face Argentina's David Nalbandian after his opponent, American John Isner, retired from their match though injury. After the match, Djokovic told reporters that he was struggling with his serve: ""You need to have a decent serve, which is going to give you some free points, and, especially on a court like this, which is quite a bit faster than the one we played on last week [in Toronto]."" ""[My serve] gets up and down. It's not what I want, but I'm slowly getting the old serve I had. I had a good motion and, when I won a grand slam, I was serving really well, around 200km per hour on average, which was great, and with a lot of precision. ""These days I'm struggling a bit, but it's a mental thing. It's going to get to me sooner or later.""

The 18-year-old, who made his full international debut against Hungary in August, has been a revelation in the Gunners' midfield this season, making eight league appearances and featuring in all three of Arsenal's Champions League matches. ""It's such great news that Jack has committed his long-term future to the club,"" manager Arsene Wenger told the London side's official website.

"(CNN)  -- Manchester United came a goal behind and shrugged off the early loss of Michael Owen to injury to beat German champions Wolfsburg 2-1 for their second victory in Champions League Group B. Giggis is congratulated by teammates after scoring his 150th goal for United. Owen, looking to impress watching England manager Fabio Capello, survived for just 20 minutes at Old Trafford before going off with a groin strain. His replacement Dimitar Berbatov proved highly effective but the enterprising visitors went ahead through a Edin Dzeko header in the 56th minute. Ryan Giggs equalized just three minutes later with his 150th goal for the Red Devils, his deflected shot finding its way home. The evergreen Giggs then set up Michael Carrick for the 76th minute winner as he curled home his shot from the edge of the penalty area. United manager Alex Ferguson paid his own compliment to the Welsh wizard as he reflected on a hard-fought home victory. ""He's unbelievable, all the infinitives, all the praise over the years, I don't know if you can add to it. He's a marvellous player."" Ferguson also revealed that Owen would be out for between two to three weeks with his latest injury. The three points leave United top of the group with two wins from two games after their eighth victory in a row in all competitions. In the other Group B action on Wednesday, CSKA Moscow bounced back from their 2-1 defeat to Wolfsburg in the first round of matches to see off Turkish champions Besiktas 2-1. Midfielders Alan Dzagoev and Milos Krasic scored for the hosts either side of half time, with Besiktas, beaten in their first two games, pulling a goal back thorugh Ismail Koybasi. In Group A, the heavyweight clash between Bayern Munich and Juventus ended in a goalless draw. Munich had several chances in their home Allianz Arena, but failed to convert them although they do top the group with four points.

"(CNN) -- A survivor of a massacre in Mexico that left 72 dead is advising other would-be migrants to stay at home to avoid a fate like the one his companions met. The victims in the killings, which happened in northern Mexico, were migrants from Central and South America who were on their journey north. In an interview with Ecuadorean state television, the survivor, identified as Luis Freddy Lala, spoke about the harrowing ordeal. Although his name has been released, his face was blurred on camera. Lala said his journey began in Ecuador, and from there he traveled to Honduras and then to Guatemala. During that leg of the trip, ""everything was fine,"" he said. From Guatemala he crossed into Mexico and made it with a large group of migrants to the northeastern Mexican state of Tamaulipas. Three cars surrounded the vehicle he was riding in, and a group of heavily armed men stepped out, forcing him into another car. The migrants were taken to a house, where they were tied up in groups of four, Lala said. Then, at one point, the hostages were all thrown on the ground, face-down. ""I heard them shooting at my friends,"" he said. ""They shot me and they killed everyone else."" From the broadcast portions of the interview, it was not clear what the motive for the massacre might have been. As soon as the gunmen finished, they left the premises, Lala said. ""When they left I waited two minutes, got up and left the house,"" he said. He walked all night and into the morning until he found a military checkpoint where he asked for help. Along the way, Lala said, he was denied help from two men he encountered. His advice to others wanting to go on the journey toward the United States is to not go because it is too dangerous to cross through Mexico. ""I'm telling all Ecuadoreans not to travel anymore, because the Zetas are killing lots of people,"" he said, referring to the cartel believed to be behind the killings. Mexican officials confirmed Wednesday that a second person survived the attack but authorities said they would not reveal the second survivor's identity for safety reasons.","Ecuadorean Luis Freddy Lala was one of two survivors of a massacre in Mexico .

"(CNN) -- A potentially fatal sheep and goat disease could spread from Tanzania into southern Africa, a United Nations agency warned, threatening millions of people's livelihoods and food supplies. Small ruminants' plague can cause death rates of up to 100 percent in sheep and goats, though it does not affect humans, the Food and Agriculture Organization warned. It could kill 50 million sheep and goats if it spreads into southern Africa, the agency said after an emergency mission to Tanzania, in east Africa. ""Sheep and goats are critical to food and income security for pastoral communities. The presence of the disease directly affects a family's wealth,"" agency's chief veterinary officer, Juan Lubroth, said Tuesday. He urged southern African nations to review border controls and surveillance and to make sure their veterinary services are prepared. And the agency advised Tanzania to ""initiate an emergency vaccination program"" in the north, where the outbreak is centered, and consider additional vaccination in the area bordering Malawi, Mozambique and Zambia. Tanzania did not immediately issue a public response to the warning.","Small ruminants' plague affects sheep and goats, and can cause death rates of 100 percent .

"New York (CNN) -- A pamphlet designed to help heroin users with advice has come under fire, with some now questioning whether the public health brochure can actually be used as a how-to guide on drug use. While concerns over the 16-page pamphlet have arisen in recent days, the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene created its ""Take Charge, Take Care: 10 Tips for Safer Use"" brochure in 2007. Its purpose, according to a statement from the department, is ""to help people who are injecting drugs reduce the harm associated with this type of drug use until they are able to get into treatment and recover."" According to the Health Department, ""accidental overdose is the fourth leading cause of early adult death in New York City, claiming more than 600 lives each year."" The agency says about 70,000 pamphlets have been produced at a cost to city taxpayers of slightly more than $32,000. ""The pamphlet provides potentially life saving advice"" reads a health department statement. But critics such as New York City Councilman Peter F. Vallone Jr., chairman of the council's Public Safety Committee, believes the pamphlet is ""an indefensible waste of taxpayer money"" and is effectively spreading a lie that there is a safe way to inject drugs. ""Heroin use is at epidemic levels in New York, and we should be spending money to address that, not teach first-timers how to use,"" says Vallone. Information in the publication takes the form of ""ten critical tips for reducing the harm that illicit drug use, and especially injection drug use can cause."" Tip topics include ""how to prevent overdose,"" ""prepare drugs carefully,"" ""take care of your veins"" and ""ask for help to stop using."" Within each of the 10 broad tips, the brochure presents several ""simple but valuable"" related ideas for users about how to lessen potential problems when injecting drugs. One suggestion reads, ""Use with someone else. If you're alone and something goes wrong, no one can help."" Another says, ""Use a new syringe, cooker, cotton, tie, and other supplies every time."" Plus, ""Warm your body (jump up and down) to show your veins."" Along with, ""Find the vein before you try to inject."" There is also information regarding HIV and hepatitis-C testing, depression and contact information for emergencies and for finding help to quit. New York City Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg addressed the pamphlet controversy on Monday, explaining how ""the health department does have an interest in -- if you're going to do certain things -- to get you to do it as healthily as you possibly can."" Don Des Jarlais, research director for the Chemical Dependency Institute, said the principle behind the pamphlet has always been to emphasize treatment and to reduce the spread of disease like HIV/AIDS. However, if people still engage in risky behavior, the ""Take Charge, Take Care"" information is meant to mitigate risks associated with intravenous drug use and present guidance for people to partake in the safest manner possible. But Vallone believes the pamphlet goes ""well beyond clean needles"" advice, providing anyone who wants to experiment with information about how to prepare drugs and find veins -- information that an already-using addict would find useless. New York state's top Drug Enforcement Administration official, John P. Gilbride, echoes Vallone, saying the pamphlet is essentially a ""how-to guide"" for drug use. Gilbride expressed his concern that the pamphlet could send a message that leads individuals to believe they can use heroin in some safe manner. ""Using heroin can never be safe. It's akin to playing Russian roulette with a loaded gun"" Gilbride told CNN. Indeed, ""there is no safe way to inject"" agreed Des Jarlais, in response to criticism that the pamphlet presents heroin use as harmless. ""I think the word 'safely' is wrong,"" he said, but if people do inject drugs, he hopes large information campaigns can help lessen risks. ""Using hard drugs is just not a smart thing to do,"" Bloomberg said Monday. ""But we have an obligation no matter what the people do in this city to make sure they do it as safe as they can."" Vallone, meanwhile rhetorically asks, ""What's next, a kids' guide for playing safely in traffic?"" Vallone said he sent a letter to the city's health commissioner Monday to immediately cease circulation and funding for the pamphlet, and he plans to ""hold his feet to the fire during upcoming budget meetings"" unless the health department admits its mistake. The pamphlet is just one component of a larger municipal effort, explained Des Jarlais. Along with the informational brochure, there are also face-to-face community outreach initiatives, expansion of drug abuse treatment facilities and 47 state-authorized syringe exchange program throughout New York City's five boroughs. Des Jarlais points to an 80 percent reduction of HIV reported among new drug users in New York City as proof that programs such as needle exchanges are working. The health department reports that overdose deaths have declined by 25 percent from 2006 to 2008, representing at least 200 fewer deaths. ""I don't think there is a healthy way [to use heroin[, but there may be less dangerous ways to do certain things,"" Bloomberg said. CNN's Cassie Spodak contributed to this report.","16-page pamphlet under fire for being a ""how-to"" guide for drug use .

"ISLAMABAD, Pakistan (CNN) -- Two explosions have struck a small cafe in volatile northwestern Pakistan, killing six people, including two police officers, local police and an official said. A paramedic treats a victim of a suicide blast at a hospital in Dera Ismail Khan on Sunday. The attack happened Sunday evening in the town of Dera Ismail Khan in Pakistan's North West Frontier Province, a frequent scene of suicide attacks. No one was killed in the first blast, which happened at a cafe near a local college, said Haji Abdul Rauf, the town's mayor. Four residents and two police officers were killed and 20 others injured when a suicide bomber struck 10 minutes later, Rauf said. The attackers were targeting police by attracting a crowd with the first blast, the mayor said. A local journalist said two of the civilians killed were reporters who had arrived after the first explosion. Pakistan's forces have been battling Taliban and al Qaeda militants in the North West Frontier Province and the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. Some of the Taliban militants conducting attacks in neighboring Afghanistan have been based in the North West Frontier Province and nearby tribal regions. The resurgence of the Taliban has prompted U.S. commanders and the incoming Barack Obama administration to put more of a focus on confronting militants along the border. The attack on Sunday came one week after a suicide car bomber -- apparently targeting people voting to fill a national assembly seat -- killed at least 37 people and wounded 16 others in the Bunair district of North West Frontier Province. In November, a suicide bomber detonated his explosives in the midst of a funeral procession in Dera Ismail Khan, killing at least seven people and injuring 30 more, police said. Days earlier, a suicide bomber struck a mosque during evening prayers in the Bajaur region of the North West Frontier Province, killing seven people.

"(CNN) -- Separate federal indictments claim that supporters of the Islamic extremist group Al-Shabaab have funneled money for brutal terrorist operations. In one case, two men were indicted in Missouri for allegedly funneling money to the Somali group, the Justice Department said Wednesday. The indictment said Mohamud Abdi Yusuf of St. Louis discussed Al-Shabaab in code language and used fictitious names and phone numbers to send money to the group's supporters through remitting businesses in the United States. Yusuf is also charged with conspiring with Abdi Mahdi Hussein, an employee of a licensed remittance company, to structure financial transactions so as to avoid any record. Hussein was also indicted and arrested for conspiracy on those transactions. A third man, Duwayne Mohamed Diriye, is accused of helping distribute that money to Al-Shabaab from inside Somalia and Kenya. He has also been charged but remains at large in east Africa. FBI special agents arrested Yusuf in St. Louis on Monday and Hussein on Tuesday in Minneapolis, Minnesota, according to the Justice Department. Both men appeared in federal court Tuesday. If convicted, Yusuf faces a maximum of 15 years in prison and/or fines of up to $250,000 for each count of providing material support to terrorists. Yusuf and Hussein could each be sentenced to a maximum of five years in prison and/or fines of up to $250,000 for conspiring to structure transactions. The indictments were made public a day after three men in San Diego, California, were similarly charged with providing support to the al Qaeda-linked group. Issa Doreh and Mohamed Mohamed Mohamud, clad in orange jumpsuits, pleaded not guilty at a federal hearing in San Diego on Wednesday. A third man named in the indictment, Basaaly Saeed Moalin, was arrested Tuesday but was not in court. The five-count indictment alleges conspiracy to provide material support to terrorists, conspiracy to provide material support to a foreign terrorist organization, conspiracy to kill in a foreign country, money laundering and providing material support to terrorists. According to the indictment, the three provided thousands in funding for Al-Shabaab to purchase weapons, including rocket-propelled grenades and improvised explosive devices. Before his death in May 2008, Al-Shabaab militant leader Aden Hashi Ayrow had called ""for foreign fighters to join Al-Shabaab in a 'holy war' against the Ethiopian and other African forces in Somalia,"" the indictment states. The defendants, individually or together, funneled about $10,000 to Somalia, the indictment states, indicating that Ayrow told them, ""it is time to finance the jihad."" Each rocket-propelled grenade cost $270, an uncharged co-conspirator told them. A U.S. missile strike killed Ayrow. Dozens of supporters for the defendants, many in traditional Muslim garb, packed the small courtroom of U.S. Magistrate Judge William Gallo, who set a bail hearing for Friday morning. Assistant U.S. Attorney William Cole requested that the men be held without bail, alleging that they are flight risks and a danger to the community. Prosecutors would not discuss the nationalities of the defendants. Al-Shabaab has been waging a war against Somalia's government in an effort to implement a stricter form of Islamic law, or sharia. Somalia has not had a stable government since 1991, and fighting between the rebels and government troops has added to the impoverished east African nation's humanitarian crisis. Just last week, Al-Shabaab publicly executed two teenage girls after accusing them of being spies for the Somali government, the group said. ""Those two girls were evil, and they were spies for the enemy [the Somali government], but the mujahedeen caught them and after investigation, they admitted their crime, so they have been executed,"" said Sheikh Yusuf Ali Ugas, commander of Al-Shabaab in Beledweyne, a town in central Somalia. Al-Shabaab is one of almost 50 groups that have been designated by the State Department as foreign terrorist organizations.

Woods and Nordegren were officially divorced Monday, nine months after a Thanksgiving-weekend incident outside the couple's home in Florida. It set in motion the crash of the golfer's once tightly controlled image, ultimately leading to his admission that he had engaged in multiple extramarital affairs during his nearly six-year marriage.

But he added they were looking at how they could help their two young children, Sam and Charlie, ""the best we possibility can."" Under their settlement, Woods and Nordegren will share custody of their children. Woods was the youngest player to win all four of golf's major tournaments in 2000. But the 34-year-old has struggled since returning to the sport he has dominated for more than a decade. He said Wednesday that going through the divorce was ""a lot more difficult than I was letting on."" Nordegren, meanwhile, has told People magazine that she was blindsided by the breakup. In an interview scheduled for publication this week, she said, ""The word 'betrayal' isn't strong enough."" ""I've been through hell,"" she said. ""It's hard to think you have this life, and then all of a sudden -- was it a lie? You're struggling because it wasn't real. But I survived. It was hard, but it didn't kill me.""

"(CNN) -- The group of wealthy businessmen planning to buy English Premier League champions Manchester United has ruled out making a bid until the end of the season. The ""Red Knights"" consortium signaled their intention to buy out the American Glazer family on March 2 and have been recruiting new investors and working on a proposal. In a press statement, however, they announced that they would not be making an offer until at least June to avoid providing a distraction from the club's pursuit of the Premier League and Champions League trophies . ""In the next few weeks we will continue to work on our proposal,"" the statement said. ""We do not expect this to be finalized before the end of the current football season. ""This will have the advantage of minimizing external distractions as the team enters the decisive period of the season."" The battle for Manchester United explained . Earlier this month, the Red Knights hired Japanese investment bank Nomura to help formulate their $1 billion move for the club. The group has been working closely with Manchester United Supporters' Trust (MUST) to help generate backing from the club's international network of fans. ""We have been speaking to and meeting many potential Red Knights who have contracted us since our interest was made public,"" the statement added. ""These potential Red Knights have offered ideas and support and with the help of this input, our plans have been developed further."" The Glazers have been criticized for the levels of debt at the current English champions, with the latest accounts showing that United are more than $1 billion in the red. The owners recently launched a bond issue to raise $750 million to reduce the debt. They also own NFL side Tampa Bay Buccaneers. United fans have shown their support for the bid with protests against the Glazer family at recent matches. The green and gold scarves that have become a symbol of their disquiet now dominate the stands at Old Trafford, while banners declaring ""Love United Hate Glazer"" are commonplace. Former United midfielder David Beckham gave the bid a lift when he donned one of the scarves as he left the field after AC Milan's March 10 Champions League defeat at Old Trafford.","Red Knights rule out Manchester United takeover bid until end of football season.

"(CNN) -- The United Nations Security Council has ended sanctions against Sierra Leone, restrictions originally imposed during the nation's brutal civil war, the Security Council announced Wednesday. The Council ended a 1997 arms embargo and a travel ban among other sanctions, in a move aimed at restoring confidence in the West African nation. While the Security Council praised Sierra Leone for its progress since the end of the decade-long conflict in 2002, it maintained the need for peacekeepers in the formerly war-torn nation. ""Sierra Leone may today no longer be one of your most critical concerns,"" said Michael von der Schulenburg, head of the United Nations Integrated Peacebuilding Office in Sierra Leone.  ""But we urge you not to abandon Sierra Leone completely. It is a potential success story, not only for Sierra Leone but for the Security Council."" U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.

"(CNN) -- New Zealand's air force has gone to the rescue of a sick American -- in Antarctica. A crew of 12, plus three medics, flew to evacuate the man Tuesday from the U.S. research base at McMurdo Station. There were limited details about the man's health, but he had an illness, rather than an injury, said New Zealand Air Force Squadron Leader Kavae Tamariki. A rescue team initially set off Monday from Christchurch, but was forced to turn back after about an hour. With the snow, ""You weren't able to see anything,"" Tamariki said. There also was snow on the runway at McMurdo. The second flight was able to touch down safely in Antarctica on Tuesday, despite temperatures of 35 below zero Celsius, he said. ""She's landed, and we're just waiting for confirmation that they've taken off,"" Tamariki said from New Zealand on Tuesday afternoon. The plane was expected back in Christchurch by Tuesday night, after a flight of 6 1/2 hours. It's the second time in six months that New Zealand's Air Force has been asked to rescue a sick American from McMurdo, because the Air Force is familiar with Antarctic weather and flying conditions, Tamariki said. It was unclear what the man in Tuesday's rescue was doing at McMurdo Station, but research is done at and near the station in aeronomy and astrophysics, biology and medicine, geology and geophysics, glaciology and glacial geology, and ocean and climate systems. McMurdo was established in 1955 to serve as the logistics hub of the U.S. Antarctic Program. The station -- on the southern tip of Ross Island, on the shore of McMurdo Sound -- has a harbor, a helicopter pad, and landing strips on sea ice and shelf ice, according to the station's website. The station, which is like a small town, includes repair facilities, dormitories, administrative buildings, a firehouse, a power plant, a water distillation plant and stores. Recorded temperatures there have fallen as low as 50 degrees below zero Celsius. Because of the tilt of the Earth and its orbit around the sun, there are two seasons in Antarctica -- summer and winter, or cold and colder. September is one of the coldest months.","A sick man needed evacuation from the U.S. research base at McMurdo Station .

"(CNN) -- Continental Airlines will no longer provide complimentary meals and snacks to economy passengers on domestic flights shorter than 6½ hours and some international flights. On Monday, the airline announced a menu and pricing for its new food-for-purchase offerings, which will debut October 12. ""Customers were asking for more variety,"" said Mary Clark, spokeswoman for Continental. Grilled chicken spinach salad, Asian-style noodle salad and Angus cheeseburgers are among the menu offerings. Prices will range from $1.50 for chips to $8.25 for the grilled chicken salad. Complimentary food service will still be available in first class and BusinessFirst on all routes worldwide, and free non-alcoholic drinks will continue to be offered to all passengers. As for economy, complimentary food will be available only on flights longer than 6½ hours, some international flights and all intercontinental flights, Clark said. This includes Houston, Texas, to Anchorage, Alaska, and Newark, New Jersey, to Hawaii, for example, as well as some Latin routes, depending on length and destination. ""There is a cost-savings benefit to it,"" she said. ""It's not a revenue-generating idea, but it will give customers what they're looking for as well as reduce the cost."" Though Clark said she was unsure whether Continental was the last major U.S. airline to offer complimentary meals to all passengers, she doesn't see the transition as negative. ""It's something that we know our customers value when they travel,"" Clark said. ""We definitely see it as a customer benefit.""","Continental announces new food-for-purchase program .

"London, England (CNN) -- Lockerbie bomber Abdelbeset al-Megrahi is ""a very sick man,"" but there is no way to tell how long he will live, according to the father of one of the people who died in the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103. Jim Swire, whose daughter Flora died in the terror attack, saw al-Megrahi a week ago in Libya, he said Tuesday. He also criticized U.S. senators who tried to hold hearings this summer into questions surrounding the release of al-Megrahi. He said he had written to them to say it was more important to let Scottish legal proceedings run their course, since a review commission had found possible miscarriages of justice in the case. ""They didn't want to know about that,"" he said of the senators, saying they had not replied to his letter. The Scottish government released al-Megrahi from prison just over a year ago on the grounds that he had cancer and was not likely to live more than three more months. Swire, who does not believe that al-Megrahi is guilty, defended the decision. ""At three months, just over half [of people with his cancer] would be dead,"" Swire said. But after three months, mortality rates level off, and there is no way to predict how long cancer sufferers will live, said Swire, a retired general practicioner. ""He can walk a few steps,"" Swire said of al-Megrahi. He did not ask al-Megrahi or his doctors about the Libyan's medical condition out of respect for his privacy, he said. But he said the fullness of his face suggested that he was on steroids to slow the cancer. Al-Megrahi was appealing his conviction when he was freed on compassionate grounds in August 2009 and then dropped the appeal. Swire thinks al-Megrahi feels guilty about having withdrawn his appeal, since it leaves him with no way to clear his name or for those -- like Swire -- who think he is innocent to have the case reviewed. But al-Megrahi's death could change the legal playing field, Swire speculated. ""If he were to die, the the situation would change,"" and Swire might be able to get the case reopened, he said. He believes that al-Megrahi ""would see to it that we would be provided with all the information his defense team has assembled,"" he said, adding that the Libyan had not explicitly told him that. Swire is in the minority among victims' families in thinking al-Megrahi is innocent. American officials blasted al-Megrahi's release at the time and on the first anniversary. ""As we have expressed repeatedly to Scottish authorities, we maintain that al-Megrahi should serve out the entirety of his sentence in prison in Scotland,"" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said in a written statement. President Barack Obama's assistant on homeland security and counterterrorism, John Brennan, called the release ""unfortunate and inappropriate."" Democratic Sens. Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg noted that al-Megrahi was only given three months to live when he was released but is still alive. Menendez noted that on August 20, 2009, al-Megrahi stepped off a plane into the arms of a cheering throng in Libya. ""A mass murderer tasted freedom, experiencing joy,"" Menendez said. ""It was a scene that made the stomach turn ... that made old wounds fresh again in the hearts of those whose family members died at the hands of that man."" Lautenberg said, ""It is the families of those victims who deserve compassion, not this terrorist."" ""Al-Megrahi ... is very much free, living in the lap of luxury by all accounts,"" Menendez said. The case has outraged many on both sides of the Atlantic and led U.S. senators to demand answers from Scotland about the details of his release. Al-Megrahi is the only person convicted in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which exploded over Lockerbie in December 1988, killing 259 people on the plane and 11 on the ground. Most of the dead were Americans. The flight had been heading to New York from Frankfurt, Germany, via London, England, when it blew up. A special Scottish court in the Netherlands convicted al-Megrahi in 2001. CNN's Melissa Gray contributed to this report.","Jim Swire, whose daughter died in the bombing of Pan Am 103, saw bomber last week .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- None of the seven doctors and one nurse investigated by the state will face criminal prosecution in the death of singer Michael Jackson, the state attorney general's office said Wednesday. But a doctor who prescribed drugs to the pop singer using a fake name shortly before the singer's death could be disciplined by the California medical board, according to Christine Gasparac, a spokeswoman for Attorney General Jerry Brown. Investigators did not find sufficient evidence to recommend criminal prosecution of any of the medical practitioners, she said. She would not identify the doctor referred to the medical board for consideration of administrative action or the others who were cleared. Dr. Conrad Murray, who was Jackson's personal physician when he died a year ago, was not part of the probe, Gasparac said. Murray was charged with involuntary manslaughter earlier this year in the entertainer's death. The Los Angeles Police Department asked the California Bureau of Narcotic Enforcement to investigate the prescription practices of seven doctors and a nurse, Gasparac said. ""After reviewing hundreds of pages of records and documents obtained from the medical practitioners, the attorney general's office has referred one doctor, who wrote prescriptions to an alias known to have been used by Jackson, to the California medical board for further review,"" she said. State drug agents executed search warrants at several doctors' offices last summer and at least one pharmacy. Agents spent several hours inside the Mickey Fine Pharmacy just below the Beverly Hills practice of Dr. Arnold Klein, Jackson's dermatologist. Investigators also visited Klein's office, where Jackson was seen several times in the weeks before his June 25, 2009 death. Klein told CNN last year that he never prescribed dangerous drugs to the singer. Searches of Jackson's rented mansion revealed a long list of prescription drugs in his bedroom after his death, according to court documents and the autopsy report. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled that Jackson's death was from an overdose of propofol, a powerful anesthesia used to put surgical patients to sleep. A consultant's report included in the autopsy said the level of lorazepam, a powerful anti-anxiety agent found in Jackson's body ""would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol."" CNN's Carey Bodenheimer contributed to this report.","LAPD asks state drug agents to probe seven Jackson doctors, one nurse .

"(RollingStone.com) -- ""Sing it if you know it,"" Pavement's Stephen Malkmus told the crowd Sunday night in Brooklyn, on the Williamsburg Waterfront, as the band prepared to play ""Stop Breathing."" Then he added, ""I tell myself that before every song. 'Sing it like you know it! Be the ball! Be the snare, Steve!'"" He didn't need to worry. In the group's first New York gig since 1999, Malkmus not only remembered all the words to the old Pavement songs, he and the rest of the band brought new flair to them. The 90s indie princes buzzed through their insanely fat songbook, 27 brilliant tunes in 90 minutes, without letting the energy level dip, lurching into each song with all their boyish enthusiasm. It was like a mix tape of the livelier moments from their 90s shows, except more so. All year long, on their first tour since they fell apart in 1999, Pavement have shown other bands how you do the reunion thing right: no new songs, no pompous gestures, just a celebration of the catalog that made them the great guitar band of the 90s. The audience on Sunday night was surprisingly young, and unsurprisingly baked, but they were there to celebrate the 90s as well. Malkmus got one of the night's biggest cheers when he looked around at the Brooklyn waterfront and mused, ""We saw a Bikini Kill show around here."" Rolling Stone: See vintage shots of Stephen Malkmus and more nineties rockers . Pavement hopped from songs everybody likes (""Gold Soundz,"" ""Summer Babe"") to songs hardly anybody ever notices (""No More Absolutes,"" ""Starlings in the Slipstream""), dipping into psychedelic jams like ""Grounded"" between sing-along raves like ""Silence Kid"" and ""Unfair."" Malkmus and Scott ""Spiral Stairs"" Kannberg traded guitar leads in the countryfied ballad ""Father to a Sister of Thought,"" giving it a whole new flavor. Drummer Steve West and bassist Mark Ibold were nimbler than ever, while percussionist/hype man Bob Nastanovich banged the tambourine, sang back-up, blew harmonica, and played a mean slide whistle solo on ""Fight This Generation."" He also slow-danced with a lucky lady as Malkmus crooned ""We Dance."" Rolling Stone: Pavement's Album Guide by Rob Sheffield . That song was a reminder of how much musical ground Pavement covered. They were the band who could do it all, mixing up New York noise with California stoner vibes, Euro art-punk with suburban American hardcore, yet make it all flow like rock & roll, and make it all seem like a breeze. They combined the elements of indie rock that fans were used to getting in half-assed dribbles and drabs. So ""Loretta's Scars"" was the best Dinosaur Jr. song ever, just as ""Zurich Is Stained"" was the best Nikki Sudden song ever -- yet these were just another couple of great Pavement songs. Sunday night they blasted through ""Silence Kid,"" with a melody swiped from Buddy Holly (""Everyday,"" to be exact), plus a throwaway guitar hook swiped from Jimi Hendrix (""Bold As Love,"" to be exact), and made it crest and surge for three wildly emotional minutes of punk rock. Who else wrote songs like this? Everybody tried to. But only Pavement pulled it off. Wily bastards, these guys. The show ended on a high note with ""Range Life,"" a wittily poignant ballad about the passing of youth. As he walked offstage after ""Range Life,"" Malkmus indulged in his only cornball rock-star gesture of the night--he tried to toss a guitar pick into the crowd. But it missed, and plopped pitifully onto the stage. Malkmus shrugged, laughed, and kept walking. Set List: . Cut Your Hair . Date With IKEA . Rattled By The Rush . Elevate Me Later . Grounded .

"London, England (CNN) -- The three Pakistani cricket players at the center of betting allegations in London left the United Kingdom on Friday. All three were interviewed by police last week under caution, meaning police believed they may have committed a crime. The players have promised to return to help investigators ""in due course,"" London's Metropolitan Police said. The players departed London's Heathrow airport at about 11:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m. ET). The betting scandal has rocked the cricket world, with allegations that members of the Pakistan national team were involved in ""spot-fixing"" during Pakistan's Test series with England late last month. Spot-fixing involves deliberately throwing parts of a game, rather than the whole match. The News of the World, the British tabloid that first reported the allegations, said players deliberately bowled ""no balls,"" or fouls, at specific points in the game and that the alleged ringleader made 150,000 pounds (about $230,000) in the scam. No players have been arrested over the allegations, but the three questioned by police -- teenage cricket star Mohammad Amir, Mohammad Asif, and team captain Salman Butt -- were provisionally suspended by the sport's governing body and charged with various offenses under the International Cricket Council's anti-corruption code. Their team is continuing a two-month tour of England without them.","The players have departed London .

"(CNN) -- World No. 1 Roger Federer got his European clay season up and running at the second attempt with a routine win in his opening match at the Estoril Open in Portugal on Wednesday. The Swiss superstar was upset by young Latvian Ernests Gulbis in Rome last month, but had no such problems against German journeyman Bjorn Phau as he triumphed 6-3 6-4 in the third-tier ATP Tour event. The 28-year-old, returning to the tournament that he won on his debut there in 2008, will next play another seeded player in Friday's quarterfinals when he takes on French veteran Arnaud Clement. ""I'm happy that I came through the first round, it was nice to win,"" Federer told reporters. ""Today was a matter of coming through tough situations. I played well when I was down 0-40 and serving for the first set. ""This win was not always beautiful but it doesn't matter. I'm sure my best tennis is not far away. I have a bit of a breather now and I'm looking forward to Friday."" Federer has now been top of the world rankings for 281 weeks, and if he can stay there for another five he will match the all-time mark of American Pete Sampras. But he has been surpassed by Rafael Nadal on the list of all-time Masters Series titles after the Spaniard won in Rome to match record-holder Andre Agassi on 17. Nadal is poised to be Federer's biggest obstacle in his bid to retain his French Open title later this month, having ended an injury-wrecked past 12 months by winning his first two events of this season on clay. Federer's route to a second success in Estoril has been made easier by the withdrawal of Croatian second seed Ivan Ljubicic, who has pulled out due to the stomach strain that ended the world No. 14's campaign in Rome. Defending champion Albert Montanes moved into the last eight with a 6-1 6-2 victory against fellow Spaniard Daniel Gimeno-Traver. The fourth seed will next play Uruguayan eight seed Pablo Cuevas, who overcame Spanish qualifier Marcel Granollers 7-6 (10-8) 7-6 (7-2). Meanwhile, top seed Marin Cilic won his opening match at the BMW Open in Munich, moving into the second round as he completed a rain-delayed 6-4 6-2 victory over Michael Berrer on Wednesday. The Croatian will next play another German, Simon Greul, whose fourth-seeded compatriot Philipp Kohlschreiber also progressed into round two by beating Daniel Brands 6-4 6-4. Russian second seed Mikhail Youzhny defeated German Andreas Beck 6-3 6-3 to reach the third round, where he faces Jan Hajek of the Czech Republic.

"(CNN) -- Former England all-rounder Andrew Flintoff has announced his retirement from all forms of cricket at the age of 32, because of a long-standing knee injury. Flintoff quit Test cricket in 2009 after helping his country regain the Ashes against rivals Australia, but was hoping to continue playing in the one-day format of the game. However, he has finally been forced to accept his playing days are over following medical advice on his right knee. Flintoff issued a statement on Thursday, saying: ""It is with both disappointment and sadness that I am announcing my retirement from all forms of cricket. ""The decision to end my career came after consultation with medical advisers. I was told that the problems I have been trying to overcome in re-hab for the last year, following the latest in a series of operations, would not recover sufficiently to allow a comeback. ""Having been told that my body would no longer stand up to the rigors of cricket, I had no alternative but to retire."" Flintoff played 79 Test matches for England, after making his debut against South Africa in 1998, but his career was blighted by injuries to his knees and ankles. He took 226 wickets at 32.78 runs per wicket and scored 3,845 runs at 31.77, with five hundreds, including a career-best of 167 against the West Indies in 2004. The highlight undoubtedly came in 2005 when a Flintoff-inspired England won the Ashes back from Australia, the first time they had beaten their rivals in 18 years. The Lancashire player scored 402 runs and took 24 wickets in that series, invoking memories of another Ian Botham's heroics against Australia in 1981.","Andrew Flintoff has announced his retirement from all forms of cricket aged 32 .

"(CNET)  -- The company paid to treat people to free newspapers in London, lighted the Empire State Building in Windows' colors and draped Toronto's CN Tower with a 300-foot banner -- all part of a massive $300 million ad campaign that accompanied the product's arrival. Windows 95, which was separate from the company's business-oriented Windows NT product, added a number of features over its predecessors including better network support, the ability to send faxes (yes, there was a time when that was a big deal) along with basic audio recording, audio playback, and video playback tools. Features now thought of as core parts of Windows, such as the start menu and taskbar, also made their debut with Windows 95. Plus, it just looked a whole lot better graphically and was far more stable than past consumer versions of Windows. Internet Explorer debuted around the same time, but was sold separately as part of Microsoft's Plus Pack for Windows 95. It was eventually bundled in directly with the operating system in an update to Windows 95 released the following year. By the time Windows 95 was finally ushered off the market in 2001, it had become a fixture on computer desktops around the world. ""If you look at Windows 95, it was a quantum leap in difference in technological capability and stability,"" Gartner analyst Neil MacDonald said at that time. A decade and a half after Windows 95 hit the market, though, one question looms large for Windows: Are all its best days in the past? Clearly it was a different time and Microsoft might be hard pressed to capture that kind of consumer attention no matter what it did. But, never mind the long lines, will Microsoft be able to continue to sell Windows at the price and volume it has? It's one of the most important questions facing Microsoft as a company. While the company has expanded far beyond its Windows roots, Windows and Office remain the engine driving the vast majority of the company's profits even as it looks to cell phones, search, and online services to augment its mainstay businesses. At the moment, the Windows business is doing quite well, with Windows 7 selling at an impressive clip. Indeed Windows 7 is selling far faster than Windows 95 did in its early days, though that's as much a testament to how large the PC market is as anything else. The longer-term question is whether Windows can outpace what I call the generic web experience. In the coming years, smartbooks, tablets, cell phones, Netbooks and shapes we probably haven't thought of will all be capable of delivering the web, which is for many people their main use of a PC. For Windows to be as relevant on Windows 95's 20th anniversary as it is today, the company will have had to manage to evolve the operating system significantly. I see a few ways this can happen, but none is a sure thing. First, Microsoft (or a third-party software maker) can develop a new killer app that only runs on Windows. It's been a long time since this happened, but certainly it's not impossible. New user interfaces can also be added. Touch is already there, as is voice control to some degree, but gesture recognition such as that found in Kinect could pave the way for new uses. Second, it could evolve Windows and Windows Live to offer a dramatically better way of doing the same tasks that most people do on the Web. Sure, we can manage our photos and music on the Web today and that is getting easier. However, tapping local storage and graphics, Microsoft has the potential to offer a better way and, with the latest version of Windows Live, is trying to do so. Third, Microsoft could enhance the value of Windows by having a browser that is demonstrably superior to non-Windows rivals. This appears to be a tall order, given that Internet Explorer, while still leading in market share, has been well behind rivals when it comes to being seen as the technical leader. For the record, this challenge is not just the one facing Microsoft. It's also the one facing Apple's Mac business. And while Microsoft must justify the $100 or so premium that it charges for Windows, Apple commands an even higher premium when comparing the Mac to one of these ""generic Web"" devices.

"(CNN) -- Football's governing body FIFA has suspended the Nigerian Football Federation (NFF) due to government interference. The indefinite ban means Nigeria won't be allowed to participate in any international matches and will not be involved in qualifying for the African Nations Cup. In the wake of the country's poor showing at the World Cup -- where they failed to get out of the group stages -- Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan decided to suspend the national team at all levels for two years. Jonathan then reversed his decision after FIFA threatened to expel Nigeria and withhold $8 million due to them for playing at the World Cup. Now they have been told they will not be readmitted to international competition until FIFA are satisfied the NFF is free to operate without any government interference. FIFA said in a statement given to CNN: ""The FIFA Emergency Committee decided today, 4 October 2010, to suspend the Nigeria Football Federation (NFF) with immediate effect on account of government interference. ""This decision follows the latest events linked to the NFF, such as the court actions against elected members of the NFF Executive Committee preventing them from exercising their functions and duties, the stepping down of the acting NFF General Secretary on the instructions of the National Sports Commission, the decision of the Minister of Sports to have the Nigerian League start without relegation from the previous season, and the fact that the NFF Executive Committee cannot work properly due to this interference. ""The suspension will be maintained until the court actions have ceased and the duly elected NFF Executive Committee is able to work without any interference. ""During the period of suspension, the NFF will not be able to be represented in any regional, continental or international competitions, including at club level, and also not in friendly matches."" Nigeria had already played one African Nations Cup qualifier against Madagascar -- a game they won 2-0.","Nigeria are banned from international competition by football's governing body FIFA .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Manchester United fans all around the world will be eagerly scouring for transfer news and gossip over the possible arrival of new players during the close season. Manchester United striker Wayne Rooney sports the club's new kit for the forthcoming season . But just as important to many supporters over the break will be being among the first to get their hands on the club's new kit. The English Premier League champions have just launched a new home kit for the forthcoming season which pays homage to their 100th year playing at their Old Trafford stadium. United's new shirt features a large chevron across the chest, which echoes the same pattern United wore on their shirts during the 1909/10 season when Old Trafford first opened. What do you think of the new kits launched by Manchester United and Chelsea? How do they compare to other shirts? Add your comments to the 'Sound off' box below. Red Devils defender Rio Ferdinand revealed the players are just as excited as the fans when it comes to wearing the latest club uniform. He said: ""You feel very proud every time you put the United kit on. When I first signed that was the thing I was most looking forward to -- putting it on and seeing how it felt. I was like an excited kid! I'm sure we'll all be buzzing when we run out in the new kits next season."" Ji-Sung Park hopes the chevron design will help inspire the players to reach new heights in the forthcoming season and added: ""I like to think of it as 'V' for victory and hopefully we can win every game we play in the new kits!"" See our photo gallery of the good, the bad, and the ugly of football shirts throughout the years. » . Although United fans are not quite as lucky as Ferdinand and Park and will have to wait until July 16 before they will be able to proudly show their colors. FA Cup winners Chelsea also have a smart new home kit which features a gladiator-style breast plate design and draws inspiration from looks that have graced the Kings Road over the years, especially seen in the ergonomically fitted shape and crew collar. The new shirt, which is on sale now, certainly meets the approval of Chelsea winger Salomon Kalou who told the club's Web site: ""The new kit is nice, so now let's see what happens in it during the new season."" Of course, football kits are not just a way of visually separating two teams on a playing field; they are increasingly an important part of a club's commercial operations. The world-record transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo to Real Madrid could be worth up to $75m a season in revenue to the Spanish giants, according to research commissioned by Weber Shandwick Sport with one of the world's leading sport business experts. Speaking on behalf of Weber Shandwick Sport, Professor Simon Chadwick, Director of the Centre for the International Business of Sport (CIBS) at Coventry University, suggests that with Kaka already moving to the Bernabéu, Real Madrid could benefit from $175m a year in additional revenue generated by the two stars. He said: ""Ronaldo can be viewed in the same bracket as David Beckham when it comes to global commercial impact, if their image is controlled right and Real Madrid improve their results in the UEFA Champions League as a result of their arrival. ""Becks sold a million shirts in his first six months at Real Madrid when he was just one of several 'galacticos' turning out for the all-whites, alongside the likes of Zinedine Zidane, Raul and the Brazilian Ronaldo. ""Even if Real signed one or two of the other stars, there would be a real focus on Cristiano Ronaldo's and Kaka talents on the pitch, but also their brand off it. That will pay for their transfers several times over, even with a bumper salary package."" Dan Jones, partner in the Sport Business group at accountancy firm Deloitte, told CNN that shirt revenues were not massive, but they were still important in taking the club's brand around the globe. Jones said shirt sales are dominated by the biggest clubs and figures would ""closely mirror"" the top of the ""Football Money League"" rich-list which would Real Madrid and Manchester United as the two biggest shirt-sellers worldwide. The outlook for sales for the forthcoming season might not be as profitable as previous years though as the global economic situations impacts on the spending power of the average fan. The ""Football Fans' Inflation Index"" released earlier this year by Virgin Money has showed large increases in the cost of an average game day for fans which could result in a drop in kit sales. Malcolm Clarke, chairman of the Football Supporters Federation in England, added: ""It will not be surprising if sales of replica shirts suffer as a result of the recession. The bottom line for fans is that you need a ticket to get into the game but you don't need a replica shirt, and when money's tight, it's the non-essentials which will go.""","Manchester United and Chelsea reveal kits for the forthcoming campaign .

"(CNN) -- Republicans appear to have regained the majority of U.S. governorships, capturing 10 in states where the previous executives were Democrats, according to CNN projections of exit poll data. But Democrats scored two takeaways Tuesday night, including in California, where CNN projected that Jerry Brown will defeat Republican Meg Whitman for the governorship now held by Republican Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is stepping down under term limits. The other takeaway states were Hawaii and Vermont. GOP women made major inroads, as New Mexico's Susana Martinez, South Carolina's Nikki Haley and Oklahoma's Mary Fallin all defeated their Democratic opponents. A widely publicized battle in New York ended with a projected Democratic victory as state Attorney General Andrew Cuomo slid past Republican favorite Carl Paladino, according to CNN analysis of exit poll data. Son of former Gov. Mario Cuomo, the younger Cuomo squared off against Paladino, a businessman and developer, after the Tea Party-endorsed candidate scored an upset victory over former Rep. Rick Lazio earlier in the GOP primary. Cuomo added to Democratic wins in New Hampshire, Maryland and Arkansas, according to the projections. But governorships in Kansas, Oklahoma, Tennessee, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, Wyoming, Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa all have gone from Democrat to GOP, according to CNN analysis of exit poll data. Republicans, however, lost Rhode Island. But Democrats didn't win it, either. Independent Lincoln Chafee, a former Republican, was projected by CNN to defeat Republican John Robitaille and Democrat Frank Caprio for the governorship. It had been vacated by Republican Gov. Don Carcieri because of term limits, . Chafee becomes Rhode Island's first governor who is neither a Republican nor a Democrat to serve since 1857. Often overshadowed during midterm campaigns, governorships can affect national politics by their influence in the redistricting of state electorates. Republicans needed a net gain of only three governorships Tuesday for a majority nationally. If the eight-state pickup margin holds, the GOP will have gained a national gubernatorial majority plus five. Tennessee became the first Republican pickup Tuesday evening, when Knoxville Mayor Bill Haslam edged past Democrat Mike McWherter. Haslam will succeed Democratic Gov. Phil Bredesen, who was precluded from running again by term limits. In Michigan, Republican Rick Snyder defeated Democratic Lansing Mayor Virg Bernero in Michigan. In Pennsylvania, CNN projected Tom Corbett, who had an 8 percentage-point lead with 84 percent of precincts reporting, as the winner over Democrat Dan Onorato. In Wisconsin, Republican Scott Walker was CNN's projected winner over Democrat Tom Barrett. In Kansas, Sam Brownback won easily over Democrat Tom Holland. In Wyoming, Republican Matt Mead was the projected winner over Leslie Petersen. In Oklahoma, Fallin defeated another woman, Democrat Jari Askins. In Ohio, Republican John Kasich, a former congressman-turned-pundit, defeated Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland, who was seeking a second term. In Iowa, former Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who had the job in 1980s and 1990s, defeated Democrat Gov. Chet Culver. In New Mexico, also a contest between female candidates, Martinez defeated Diane Denish in a race to replace Democratic Gov. Bill Richardson. And in Maine, GOP candidate Paul LePage, the mayor of Waterville, will succeed term-limited Democratic Gov. John Baldacci. LePage led independent candidate Eliot Cutler by fewer than 8,500 votes; Cutler conceded Wednesday. Addressing her cheering supporters Tuesday night, Martinez hit repeatedly on one theme: ""You were the ones telling me how desperately we needed to move New Mexico in a new direction,"" she said. ""At the end of the day, New Mexico chose a new direction."" In South Carolina, Haley became the state's first female governor by defeating Democratic opponent Vincent Sheheen in a tightly contested race. Haley, a 38-year-old state representative, is supported by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin and Tea Party activists, and has promised to tackle unemployment and excess government spending by way of a 10-year plan. During a bitter campaign runup, Sheheen hammered Haley on reports of late tax payments while campaigning on the scandal surrounding the former governor. The governor's race in South Carolina had earned a prominent stage among a series of high-profile gubernatorial elections that some analysts speculate could be a bellwether for future presidential politics. On Wednesday, Vermont's Republican Lt. Gov. Brian Dubie conceded the race -- which came down to the wire -- to his opponent, Democrat Peter Shumlin. Dubie's campaign said he called Shumlin to congratulate him Wednesday morning. ""It was extremely close, with only 3,000 votes or so determining the outcome, but he decided it was in the best interests of the state to let the transition proceed without calling for a recount,"" Dubie spokeswoman Kate Duffy said in an e-mail to CNN. Nevada, Arizona, Alaska, Georgia, Idaho, Utah, Texas, Nebraska, South Dakota, Alabama and South Carolina returned Republicans to their governor's mansions; Colorado, Arkansas, New Hampshire, New York, Massachusetts and Maryland did likewise for Democrats. In Texas, incumbent Gov. Rick Perry defeated Democrat Bill White, and Democratic incumbents held on to governorships in Arkansas and New Hampshire, based on projections. In New Hampshire, incumbent John Lynch bested Republican challenger John Stephens, while in Arkansas, Democrat Mike Beebe defeated GOP nominee Jim Keet. Democratic incumbents also held on in Massachusetts, where Gov. Deval Patrick was projected to defeat Republican Charlie Baker, and in Maryland, where Gov. Martin O'Malley was projected to prevail over Bob Ehrlich. In Baltimore, O'Malley thanked state employees and campaign workers, pledging to ""move Maryland forward"" by creating jobs and in what he described as a ""new economy."" In South Dakota, Republican Lt. Gov. Dennis Daugaard edged past Democrat Scott Heidepriem. In Georgia, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, the Republican candidate, defeated former Gov. Roy Barnes, according to a CNN projection based on exit poll data. Deal narrowly defeated Tea Party favorite and former Georgia Secretary of State Karen Handel for the state's Republican nomination. The national spotlight turned on the Georgia race when national GOP heavyweights Sarah Palin and Mitt Romney endorsed Handel, while Mike Huckabee and Newt Gingrich backed Deal. In Nevada, Republican Brian Sandoval, who had beaten scandal-plagued incumbent Gov. Jim Gibbons in the primary, defeated Democrat Rory Reid. In Arizona, incumbent Republican Gov. Jan Brewer defeated Democrat Terry Goddard. In Alaska, Sarah Palin's successor as governor, former Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell, beat Democratic Ethan Berkowitz, a former state representative. In Hawaii, Democrat and former Rep. Neil Abercrombie won back the governorship for his party by defeating Republican Lt. Gov. Duke Aiona. Republican Gov. Linda Lingle left the seat due to term limits.","NEW: Republican Paul LePage has narrow win in Maine .

"(Mashable) -- If you're confused because your Facebook News Feed is filled with women saying that they ""like it on"" the floor or the kitchen counter, you're not alone. It's all part of a new Internet meme that has gone viral on Facebook to raise awareness for breast cancer. First things first, though: These women are actually referring to where they like to place their purses, not to their favorite places to make love. Of course, part of the reason this meme has gone viral is due to its heavy sexual connotations. The reason for all of these ""I like it on"" status updates is simple: October is Breast Cancer Awareness Month, and hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of women are using this meme as a rallying cry to raise awareness for cancer research. The status updates naturally get their friends to ask them about their commentary, which is exactly the point of this meme. Like any social platform, Facebook is susceptible to rapidly spreading memes. In January bra color status updates started dominating newsfeeds worldwide, again to raise awareness for breast cancer. While we don't know where the campaign originated from, it's cute, fun and generating some buzz (especially useful, as the commenters point out, for getting women to go in for their medical examinations). Still, we can't forget that this is a disease that will kill 10 million women in the next 25 years, so we also implore you to donate to breast cancer research if you can. © 2010 MASHABLE.com.

"(CNN) -- Nigel De Jong has been dropped from the Netherlands squad for their Euro 2012 qualifying matches against Moldova and Sweden. The Manchester City midfielder was involved in a tackle that broke the leg of Newcastle United's Hatem Ben Arfa in Sunday's English Premier League match at Eastlands. The 25-year-old was not shown a card for the challenge, nor did the referee deem it to be a foul, but Newcastle later confirmed that Ben Arfa had suffered a double fracture. Coach Bert van Marwijk told the Dutch Football Federation's official website: ""I just informed the squad and told him I saw no other possibility. ""In the near future I will discuss this matter with Nigel but right now we have to focus on the upcoming two matches."" It is not the first time a tackle from De Jong has caused controversy after his high challenge on Spain's Xabi Alonso during the World Cup final. He was shown a yellow card after planting his boot into Alonso's chest. Prior to that United States international Stuart Holden had his leg broken in a friendly with the Netherlands after a De Jong tackle. Van Marwijk was quoted as telling the Dutch Algemeen Dagblad newspaper: ""I've seen the pictures back. It was a wild and unnecessary offence. He went in much too hard. ""It is unfortunate, especially since he does not need to do it. The funny thing is that the referee did not even show a yellow card for it. ""Apparently, there are other standards. But I have a problem with the way Nigel needlessly looks to push the limit. I am going to speak to him.'' Twente midfielder Wout Brama and Ajax winger Urby Emanuelson have been drafted into Van Marwijk's squad for the double header.

"CNN -- Fernando Alonso insists Ferrari will bounce back from Sunday's controversial European Grand Prix. Events in Valencia saw Red Bull's Mark Webber suffer a high-speed crash on lap ten, forcing the safety car to appear. Alonso claimed the race had been ""manipulated"" after his title rival Lewis Hamilton, of McLaren, overtook the safety car but still managed to finish second despite being hit with a 20-second drive-through penalty. The Spaniard left Valencia's street circuit frustrated after finishing in eighth place, securing only one point, and he later blamed the safety car incident for his poor finish calling the race ""unfair"" for those who ""respected the rules and didn't overtake the yellow flag"". Alonso says he now regrets reacting ""emotionally"" and for saying things that ""can be interpreted wrongly"". ""I was very angry about everything that happened, "" he told Ferrari's official website. ""But now that anger has been transformed into positive energy driving a desire to fight back. ""What I meant was that those drivers who, like us, respected the regulations, unfortunately, in this situation, suffered much more than those who broke them, even though they were given a penalty,"" he added. ""And I am not referring to any of the drivers in particular. I was pleased to hear that the FIA has reacted promptly, calling an extraordinary meeting of the Sporting Working Group. ""I am confident, certain even, that all the points up for discussion will be cleared up in a comprehensive fashion."" Alonso now insists he has put the disappointment behind him and is now keen to get back to winning ways at the British Grand Prix on July 11. ""Right from Tuesday morning, my mind was already focused on the next Grand Prix at Silverstone, where we will try and channel all that accumulated energy into the car to try and make up for what escaped us, for one reason or another, in Valencia.""","Fernando Alonso vows to bounce back from Sunday's controversial European GP .

"(CNN)  -- Substitutes Loic Remy and Yoann Gourcuff scored late goals as France boosted their Euro 2012 qualifying campaign with a 2-0 victory over Romania in the Stade de France on Saturday night. Youngster Remy, sent on by coach Laurent Blanc as the match looked set to end goalless, raced on to an Alou Diarra through ball to score in the 83rd minute. Gourcuff thumped home the second in stoppage time to seal a vital three points, their second straight victory taking them top of Group D with six points from three games. ""It was a magical feeling to score,"" Marseille star Remy told AFP. ""Now we're top of the group despite our poor start (losing at home to Belarus) so we've got things back on track. I hope we can continue in that vein."" The revamped Les Bleus had been denied by an inspired display from visiting goalkeeper Costel Pantilimon until their late goal flurry. In one frantic spell in the second half, he denied Mathieu Valbuena, Karim Benzema and Samir Nasri with a string of stunning saves. He deflected Valbuena's shot onto the crossbar and blocked efforts from Real Madrid's Benzema and Arsenal's Nasri from close range. But Romania were also a threat and soon afterwards thought they had gone ahead through Cristian Sapunaru, but his shot, after a mistake by Gael Clichy, hit the inside of the post and into the grateful arms of Hugo Lloris. France, looking to rebound after a disastrous World Cup and losing their group opener to Belarus, produced a lively first half display and Benzema came close to opening the scoring as his curling effort shaved the outside of the post. In other Euro 2012 qualifying action, Niko Kranjcar's first-half double gave Croatia a 2-1 win in Israel and lifted them to the top of Group F. Tottenham's Kranjcar scored his opener from the penalty spot in the 38th minute and added his second four minutes later.

"(CNN) -- A Zambian judge has granted bail to two Chinese men charged with attempted murder in a mine shooting that has revived an outcry against foreign employers in the southern African nation. Chinese managers at a mine in the southern part of the nation used shotguns to fire at a gathering of workers last month. The miners, who were protesting poor labor conditions, were unarmed, according to Zambian government officials. At least 11 miners were wounded. ""Where did the Chinese get the right to shoot innocent Zambians, including my son,"" asked Leonard Kapwizi. Kapwizi's question reverberates with other Zambians, some of whom say foreign employers are increasingly above the law. Kapwizi's son, Vincent Chenjele, was hospitalized. Three Chinese employees were also injured and mine equipment damaged, according to Chinese state media. The two suspects --detained for more than two weeks -- appeared before a judge Tuesday on 13 counts of attempted murder. They were ordered to surrender their passports. The shooting at Collum is the latest in a string of attacks between Zambian workers and Chinese managers at the coal mine. In June, Zambian state media reported that a Chinese national ""escaped lynching by an angry mob"" after 22 miners were seriously injured in a gas explosion. In late 2009, Collum mine workers ""threw missiles"" at Chinese managers after receiving ""slave wages,"" according to Zambian state media. Zambian officials have worked to quell the anti-Chinese outbursts that have followed such incidents. ""Let us be careful that we don't single out [Chinese] people,"" President Rupiah Banda said after the recent shootings. ""Every day people are shot by Zambians; are shot by white people; are shot by the Americans; they are shot by everybody. You know this business of Chinese! Chinese! It's like you want to create a phobia against people."" Politicians find themselves locked in a delicate dance: fostering a business climate that boosts Chinese investment while ensuring their constituencies don't feel shunned. China is Zambia's largest source of foreign investment. It has a huge influence on the nation's economy, especially in the mining industry. In 2008, more than 55 percent of all foreign money invested in Zambia came from China, according to the Zambia Development Agency. Out of every overseas dollar that poured into Zambian mining, nearly 73 cents were from China. Zambian government officials are quick to point out that this investment has created jobs and other benefits for locals. ""Zambia cherishes the Chinese investment,"" says Elijah Muchima, deputy minister of Southern province, where Collum is located. The Chinese Foreign Ministry said it hopes the mining company will resolve the problem with its host country, according to Xinhua news agency. The Chinese government has always urged its companies to comply with the laws of host countries, said Ma Zhaoxu, a spokesman for the ministry. Ma said China values safeguarding local employees' rights. But some worry that China's economic influence often translates into getting preferential treatment that puts it above the law in Zambia. In the latest case, Muchima implied that the defendants would be handled, at least in part, by the Chinese Foreign Ministry. ""There is nobody above the law. But you have got systems in place ... we have signed agreements; bilateral agreements between this government and their government. If there is an issue, it has to go through the normal ways; through the Minister of Foreign Affairs. I cannot comment on their dealings. That would be against the protocol that has been signed."" Former presidential candidate Michael Sata is a major critic of Chinese employers in the nation. During his failed 2006 campaign, he said Zambia needed ""investors, not infesters,"" according to local media. In the aftermath of the Collum shooting, the Zambian Post quoted Sata as saying, ""We know we can't be protected by this government because it has been heavily corrupted by the Chinese."" Padraig Carmody, a lecturer at Dublin's Trinity College, said corruption was evident while he was doing field work in Zambia last year. ""We talked to trade union officials, and what they said was that the labor inspectors, when they come and look at the labor conditions, and enforcement of the minimum wage and things like that, they tend to favor the Chinese mining houses and other investors over workers' rights."" Chinese employers in the country bypass the laws, added Jan Kees van Donge, a researcher at the University of Leiden in the Netherlands. ""They don't act like they are subject to Zambian law, and put themselves, therefore, above Zambian sovereignty. They are undermining Zambian sovereignty,"" Donge said. However, Muchima reiterated that the nation can handle affairs within its jurisdiction. Journalist Chibaula D. Silwamba contributed to this report.","Two Chinese men are facing attempted murder charges in the shooting of mine workers .

"(CNN) -- FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke has admitted to flaws in the ticketing system for the World Cup in South Africa and vowed not to make the same mistakes for the 2014 event in Brazil. Tickets for the 2010 World Cup were slow to sell after FIFA's rigid internet-based system alienated South Africans, who are more accustomed to buying tickets at the stadium. With fewer foreign fans making the trip than expected, FIFA belatedly introduced an over-the-counter system in order to attract more local support, but only 45,000 tickets were sold to African countries outside the host nation. In an interview with CNN, Valcke said the key lesson for the sport's governing body was to engage more with the local culture before deciding on the ticketing system. ""Let's check first how Brazilians are being tickets,"" he said. ""We arrived in South Africa using the internet. It was the wrong system. ""If the internet is working in Brazil let's use the internet. But let's just make sure we understand exactly how it works before we decide the system we put in place."" Valcke said the key difference between South Africa 2010 and Brazil 2014 would be the strength of the host nation. While South Africa became the first host nation to be eliminated at the group stage, five-time champions Brazil will be expected to go all the way on home soil. ""In South Africa the goal was not to win the World Cup, the goal was to organize,"" said Valcke. ""In Brazil the goal will be to win the World Cup at home for the first time.""","FIFA general secretary Jerome Valcke admits South Africa 2010 ticketing errors .

"Paris, France (CNN)  -- Five paintings, including a Matisse and a Picasso, were stolen overnight from a Paris museum, the Paris mayor's office said Thursday. The paintings were stolen from the Museum of Modern Art and included works by Georges Braque, Ferdinand Leger and Amedeo Modigliani, French police said. The artworks are worth a total of just less than 100 million euros ($123.7 million), said Christophe Girard, an aide to the mayor of Paris. The city runs the museum. But the prosecutor's office estimated the value of the lost works at 500 million euros ($617 million.) The city of Paris Web site named them as ""Le Pigeon aux Petits Pois"" (Pigeon with peas) by Picasso, ""La Pastorale"" (The Pastoral) by Matisse, ""L'Olivier pres de l'Estaque"" (Olive Tree near the Estaque) by Braque, ""La femme a l'eventail"" (Woman with Fan) by Modigliani, and ""Nature morte aux chandeliers"" (Still Life with Candlesticks) by Leger. Paris Mayor Bertrand Delanoe said he was ""particularly saddened and shocked by this theft which is an intolerable affront to the universal cultural heritage of Paris."" Delanoe said in a statement that part of the museum's security system -- the part that detects movement and body heat -- had been broken at least since March 30. The museum notified the service provider that day and asked for replacement equipment, but it still has not been provided, the mayor said. Video surveillance of the museum was working normally, and three guards were on duty, he added. Delanoe called for an administrative investigation in addition to the criminal one, he said, to determine if ""technical or human failures helped make this security breach possible.""","Five paintings stolen overnight from Paris museum .

"(CNN) -- Valentino Rossi revealed he is still fighting pain ahead of the U.S. Grand Prix, as MotoGP championship leader Jorge Lorenzo set the pace in qualifying at Laguna Seca. World champion Rossi will start on the second row of the grid on Sunday after finishing sixth fastest, in what will be just his second race back after breaking his leg in early June. Lorenzo, who has a 47-point advantage over Dani Pedrosa in the overall standings, claimed his fifth consecutive pole position -- and the 40th of his career -- as he edged out 2007 world champion Casey Stoner with his penultimate lap of one minute 20.978 seconds. The Fiat Yamaha rider was the only one to break the 1:21 mark, with Ducati's Stoner clocking 1:21.169. Andrea Dovizioso headed off Repsol Honda teammate Pedrosa to take third place, while American Ben Spies was fifth in 1:21.679. Nine-time world champion Rossi clocked 1:21.688 to edge out another U.S. rider, the 2006 overall winner Nicky Hayden. The Italian revealed that he was troubled more by his shoulder problem than his leg. ""I think it's going to be very difficult tomorrow because this track is a lot harder for me than Sachsenring [in Germany], but I hope I can have a good race,"" he told the MotoGP website on Saturday. ""There are a few corners where we know we can be a bit faster, so tomorrow morning we will try to make some small changes to the setting to allow that, then I need to get a good start. ""My leg feels better than yesterday, which is good. The problem today is the shoulder because my left one isn't strong enough to compensate completely for the lack of power in my right one, and now I have some pain in both! ""My hope for tomorrow is to be able to finish the race without too much pain and to do the best we can in the circumstances. We didn't go too badly today but we need to improve our setting a little bit to get closer to the leaders. ""Lorenzo and Stoner are very fast but after that there are a few riders quite close together, including me, so it's not too bad."" Dovizioso is third overall on 102 points, 36 behind Pedrosa, with Stoner fourth on 83 ahead of Hayden (78) and Rossi (74) with 10 races to go.","World champion Valentino Rossi qualifies sixth for Sunday's U.S. Grand Prix .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool's dramatic week ended in disappointment as Everton claimed a 2-0 victory in the Merseyside derby at Goodison Park on Sunday to leave their rivals second from bottom of the Premier League table. Roy Hodgson's Liverpool side came into the match on the back of a tumultuous last seven days which saw the club finally sold to the owners of the Boston Red Sox baseball team. And all the disruption off the pitch continues to transmit into poor results on the pitch, as goals either side of half-time from Tim Cahill and Mikel Arteta gave Everton a deserved win. Both teams came into the match struggling near the foot of the table, with Everton 17th and Liverpool 18th in the 20-team division. However, the home side dominated throughout and took a deserved lead when Tim Cahill thundered home a shot after good work on the right from Seamus Coleman. And the points were secured five minutes after the interval when Spanish midfielder Arteta was given too much space on the edge of the area to fire home through a crowd of players. The result lifts Everton up to 11th place but only goal difference now separates Liverpool from lying bottom of the table, their lowest-ever Premier League position. Meanwhile, Manchester City are up to second place in the table after a hard-fought 3-2 win at newly-promoted Blackpool. After a goalless first half, City took the lead whan captain Carlos Tevez flicked home a cross from substitute David Silva. Blackpool levelled when Marlon Harewood glanced home a Charlie Adam free-kick, but City immediately went down the other end and Tevez fired home a deflected shot to restore the visitors' lead.

"(CNN) -- Liverpool's Spain striker Fernando Torres may miss the struggling English Premier League club's derby clash with city rivals Everton later this month after suffering another injury setback. Torres was forced off the pitch inside the first 10 minutes of Sunday's defeat by Blackpool with a groin injury, and the 26-year-old could now face two weeks on the sidelines. He has already been ruled out of Spain's Euro 2012 qualifiers at home to Lithuania on Friday and away to Scotland on Tuesday. ""Fernando was assessed at Melwood and underwent a scan this afternoon,"" Liverpool's head of sports medicine and sports science, Dr Peter Brukner, told the club's official website on Monday. ""He will have intensive treatment over the next couple of weeks, but it is too early to say if he will be fit for the game against Everton."" The former Atletico Madrid star has endured a frustrating year, battling for both form and fitness. Despite picking up a World Cup winners' medal with Spain in July, Torres' summer ended in disappointing fashion, as he exited the final against Netherlands early through injury after failing to score during the tournament. He has also struggled to find the net at the start of the 2010-11 Premier League season, scoring just one goal in six matches. Liverpool manager Roy Hodgson will be eager to include the forward in his team for the Merseyside derby on October 17, with his side in desperate need of a result. After their latest defeat, the five-time European champions have picked up only one win from seven league matches, dropping into the relegation zone below Everton on goal difference. Meanwhile, Brazil defender Alex will miss the international friendlies against Iran on Thursday and Ukraine on Monday after injuring his thigh in Chelsea's win over Arsenal on Sunday. He suffered the problem late in the match, having scored the second goal in the Premier League leaders' 2-0 triumph, and is now expected to be out for three weeks, the club's website reported.

"(CNN)  -- World champion Valentino Rossi capped his remarkable return to the MotoGP circuit by taking fourth place behind Dani Pedrosa in his first race since breaking his leg six weeks ago. Spaniard Pedrosa on a Honda came in clear of Rossi's Yamaha teammate Jorge Lorenzo in the German round of the championship at Sachsenring. Former world champion Casey Stoner pipped Rossi for the final place on the podium in a thrilling finish. Australian Stoner on a Ducati only came past the nine-time world champion on the last corner to deny the 98,000 spectators the sight of Rossi collecting the third place trophy on crutches. The Italian ace shrugged off his physical impediment and said he was racing for his own satisfaction. ""It was easier with a broken leg, and very comfortable from a psychological perspective, because I was there to enjoy myself as I'm no longer in contention for the championship,"" he told the official MotoGP website. Earlier, the race was stopped by a three-bike crash which left French rider Randy de Puniet with a double leg fracture. The restart saw a shortened 21-lap race which gave Pedrosa the chance to register his second win of the season and cut Lorenzo's lead in the title race. ""When they stopped I wasn't sure about the restart. When you stop and restart it's never the same thing, but for me it was good,"" he said. Lorenzo had to settle for the runner-up spot, conceding that his compatriot was faster on the day. ""Pedrosa got more pace than me, it was impossible to follow him. He's done a splendid race, so I'm happy with second place, it's very positive for the championship."" But much of the focus was on Rossi, who suffered a broken tibia in a crash at Mugello 42 days ago, and was expected to be ruled out for the rest of the season. He has missed four rounds to effectively derail his hopes of defending his crown, but his battle with old rival Stoner kept the massive crowd enthralled. ""I did the best I could this afternoon. I thought Valentino was going to get me but I dragged everything I could out of my bike to get past him,"" admitted Stoner.

"(CNN) -- It's laughable to watch political prognosticators on the various TV shows weigh in on Rahm Emanuel's chances of becoming the next mayor of Chicago, Illinois. If you trust any of them, you swear President Barack Obama's outgoing chief of staff sees the position as a birthright that he is about to assume now that Richard M. Daley is stepping down. Folks, don't buy the national media hype. As they say, all politics is local, and in this case, Emanuel has a long way to go before he can even think of moving into the fifth floor mayoral suite. Chicago has long been called a city of neighborhoods, and as a resident of the city for the last six years, I have witnessed the territorial views of its residents live and with full effect. River North. Bronzeville. South Loop. Hyde Park. Beverly. Bridgeport. You name it, Chicago is a city that is all about its neighborhood boundaries, and when you ask someone where they were born and raised, they are likely to give you the street address rather than just the South Side, North Side or West Side. And those boundaries are often defined by race. With that being said, the issue of race will be a major obstacle for Emanuel, and not because he's white and Jewish. First, it's assumed that because he was a Chicago congressman for six years, he's well known in the city. Not true. Yes, he did represent a Northwest Chicago district, but there are political strongholds all across the city, and he's going to have to navigate them. The Chicago Sun-Times commissioned a poll shortly after Daley announced he wasn't seeking re-election, Emanuel placed fifth with 7 percent, within the margin of error. Those topping the poll: Cook County Sheriff Tom Dart (12 percent); state Sen. James Meeks (10 percent); Rep. Luis Gutierrez and Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. at 9 and 8 percent, respectively. Chicago has never had a Hispanic mayor, and African-Americans are still champing at the bit to revive the legacy of former Rep. Harold Washington, who stunned the nation with his election in 1983 when he bested a younger Richard M. Daley and Mayor Jane Byrne in the Democratic primary. No one thought he had a chance because race has loomed large in heavily Democratic Chicago, and that was on full display when Washington eked out a victory that November against Bernard Epton, a white Republican who no one gave a shot and who some say subtly stoked the fears of white residents about a black takeover. His death in 1987 still resonates in the city, and with Daley reigning supreme for two decades, running everything from the schools to public housing to the rail system and the city college system, that enormous constituency sees this moment as an opportunity to finish what Washington started. African-Americans dominate five of the city's top 10 wards. And of the top 23 wards with registered voters, African-Americans control a majority in 12. Don't assume that Emanuel, being a Democrat, can easily win those. And if you're one of those folks who think it's wrong for me to focus on race, then you clearly don't get Chicago politics. It is an open secret in Washington that the Congressional Black Caucus despises Emanuel. A longtime caucus member told me that normally when they meet with the president, the chief of staff attends the meetings. But in the time Obama has been in the White House, Emanuel didn't attend one meeting, and has always given a cold shoulder to black members of Congress. And if you ask black political operatives, pollsters and insiders, they all have a ""why-I-can't-stand-Emanuel"" story. If he wants to win the mayor's race, just having the public support of Obama isn't enough. He is going to have to deal with Reps. Danny Davis, Bobby Rush and Jesse Jackson Jr. All three have massive ground troops, and if they are willing to rally around someone like the Rev. James Meeks, also a state senator (I attend his church, Salem Baptist Church of Chicago), who can also pull white social conservatives to his side, Emanuel can forget about getting a significant share of the black vote. Then there is Chicago's Hispanic community. The population is substantial, but to count, they need to be registered voters, and Hispanic voters do not dominate a large portion of the 50 wards. Yet winning their votes is vital to building a winning constituency. And with many blaming Emanuel for no progress on immigration reform over the last 18 months, and with Emanuel facing brutal scrutiny from Gutierrez, a major immigration reform proponent, he's going to have to do a lot of politicking in order to win. Of course, there are the city's white voters. You have the Lakefront liberals and the city's blue-collar workers, who are strong union supporters. Emanuel has been at odds with unions in his time as chief of staff, notably over health care and the primary bid of Arkansas Sen. Blanche Lincoln, and the national labor leaders will be quick to remind their supporters in Chicago just how good a friend Emanuel was or wasn't. Emanuel will also have to stare down Dart, a white man who won office with a multiracial coalition and has gained high marks, especially for refusing to follow through on serving residents with eviction notices from their foreclosed homes. If he is in the race, along with Alderman Robert Fioretti, a savvy politician from the West Side of Chicago, they will be able to win a sizeable portion of the white vote, thereby leaving Emanuel on the outside looking in. Emanuel rightfully gets praise for his tough-as-nails approach to politics. But in a city that is used to Daley running the show with an iron fist for so many years, frankly, this might be the wrong time for someone with Emanuel's style to seek the city's top post. We can expect a bruising battle in February for the job, and as many as 15 candidates could be on the ballot. The top two vote getters will go to a runoff, and there is a strong chance that Emanuel may not be one of those two. His run is certainly a gamble, and suffice it to say this could be the riskiest political decision he has ever had to make. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roland S. Martin.","Rahm Emanuel is leaving White House with ambition of becoming Chicago's mayor .
Roland Martin says it won't be as easy as some people think .
He says Emanuel faces a challenging field and has some handicaps .

"(CNN) -- A security test at NASA's Glenn Research Center caused a brief incident Friday after unconfirmed reports of a gunman in the facility became public. There never was a gunman and no one was in danger at the 350-acre research facility next to Cleveland Hopkins International Airport in Ohio, according to NASA spokeswoman Katherine Trinidad. Trinidad had initially relayed unconfirmed reports of a gunman in the facility. NASA spokeswoman Lisa Malone at the Kennedy Space Center said NASA offices nationwide were unaware of the security exercise. The center, named for former astronaut and Sen. John Glenn of Ohio, is involved in research on a variety of NASA projects. It most recently was a lead center for research on a proposed rocket and spacecraft system to carry astronauts back to the moon. About 3,000 people work at the center, according to the NASA website. In April 2007, a NASA engineer shot and killed another engineer and then turned the gun on himself at the Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas. In that incident, NASA officials identified the shooter as Bill Phillips, a contract employee, and the dead victim as David Beverly, a NASA employee.

"Washington (CNN) -- Fresh off an electoral bruising for his Democratic Party, President Obama heads to India on Friday to launch a 10-day Asian trip intended to expand export markets and strengthen security cooperation in what he considers a region vital to U.S. interests. The trip to India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan encompasses a G-20 summit, an Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit, major holidays in India and Indonesia, and bilateral talks with Chinese President Hu Jintao and at least five other leaders, as well as four presidential news conferences. It's all part of an administration focus on Asia as a strategic region in the 21st century, said Ben Rhodes, the deputy national security adviser for strategic communications. ""If you look at the trend lines in the 21st century, the rise of Asia, the rise of individual countries within Asia, is one of the defining stories of our time,"" Rhodes said last week, adding, ""We see core U.S. national interests that will be advanced by us playing a key role in helping to shape the future of the region and making clear that we're an Asian and a Pacific power."" The first stop is India, where Obama will spend three days -- the longest stay in any foreign country of his presidency so far -- to emphasize ties between the world's two largest democracies, top administration officials said. Obama has called the U.S. relationship with India a ""defining partnership of the 21st century,"" noted Bill Burns, the undersecretary of state for political affairs. ""The simple truth is that India's rise and its strength and progress on the global stage is deeply in the strategic interest of the United States,"" Burns said. ""We're the world's two largest democracies. We're both big, diverse, tolerant societies. We're two of the world's largest economies. We both have an increasing stake in global stability and prosperity, especially across Asia and the Pacific."" Michael Froman, the deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs, said India was ""one of the most important emerging economic relationships for the United States."" ""With 1.2 billion people and an economy expected to grow at 8 percent a year for the next several years, we really see India as a potentially very important market for U.S. exports,"" Froman said. The president's itinerary in India includes a speech to the Indian Parliament, a state dinner and a wreath-laying at the grave of Indian independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. According to Rhodes, Obama departs Washington on Friday and arrives Saturday in Mumbai, where he will attend a business conference and visit the Gandhi Museum, then head to New Delhi for bilateral talks with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, the Parliament speech and the state dinner. The trip also includes a town hall-style meeting with Indian students, a celebration of the Hindu holiday Diwali and a visit to Humayun's Tomb, an architectural precursor to the Taj Mahal. Obama then heads to Indonesia to meet with President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono and attend a state dinner in the nation where he spent part of his childhood. The two-day visit also will include a news conference with Yudhoyono, a visit to the Istiqlal Mosque and a public speech at a to-be-determined outdoor venue to the people of the world's largest Muslim-majority nation, Rhodes said. ""In that speech, he'll have a chance to talk about the partnership that we're building with Indonesia but also to talk about some of the themes of democracy and development and our outreach to Muslim communities around the world, while also speaking of Indonesia's pluralism and tolerance as well,"" Rhodes said. ""While a Muslim majority, it's a host to a broad religious diversity, so this speech will give the president an opportunity to discuss some of the themes that many of you have heard him talk about and to do so, again, in a country where he can speak to the importance of Indonesia to him, personally, having lived there for several years in Jakarta as a boy,"" Rhodes added. The trip to South Korea is for the G-20 summit in Seoul but will include the bilateral meeting with Hu and a speech to U.S. troops stationed there on the Veterans Day holiday in the United States. Obama's talks with Hu will be their seventh bilateral meeting, along with three others the president has held with Chinese Premier Wen Jibao, for an unprecedented amount of top-level contact with China, noted Jeff Bader, the senior director for Asian affairs of the National Security Council. Bader said U.S.-Chinese relations have always included issues of cooperation and contention, and although attention focuses on the points of disagreement, he cited areas of agreement in recent years. ""We established a strategic and economic dialogue,"" Bader said. ""We've been favorable to greater Chinese participation, a greater role in the IMF and World Bank. We've worked with China, I think, quite well on Iran, on the U.N. Security Council resolution, which was a stronger resolution than anyone I think inside or outside the government would have anticipated when that process started."" Relations with China on other issues, such as climate change and North Korea's nuclear activities, were ""complicated,"" Bader said. He didn't mention U.S. complaints that China's currency is undervalued, resulting in a trade advantage for Chinese goods over American goods that contributes to the U.S. trade deficit. Obama's Seoul visit also includes a bilateral meeting with South Korean President Lee Myung-bak and a news conference, Rhodes said. A message of the trip for North Korea will be the benefits to South Korea from its partnership with the United States and the West, according to Rhodes. ""South Korea and North Korea were basically equally developed 60 years ago, and now you see a South Korea that is closely allied with the United States, that has embraced democracy, that has embraced open market reforms, is one of the most dynamic, growing economies and powers on the East Asia stage but also the world stage, as evidenced by hosting the G-20,"" Rhodes said. In Japan, Obama will speak to a CEO Business Summit that is part of the APEC meeting, take part in the APEC events and hold bilateral talks with Prime Minister Naoto Kan of Japan, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. It will be Obama's first meeting with Gillard since she became prime minister in August of a nation that Bader called ""a close ally"" that has supported the U.S.-led NATO mission in Afghanistan. The trip concludes with a visit to the Great Buddha statue in Yokohama, which Obama visited as a child, according to Rhodes. He said first lady Michelle Obama will accompany the president in India and Indonesia, but their daughters will remain home to continue their schooling.","The president will visit India, Indonesia, South Korea and Japan .

"(CNN) -- A leader of the Gulf drug cartel -- Antonio Ezequiel Cardenas Guillen, also known as ""Tony the Storm"" -- died during a clash with security forces in the border city of Matamoros, Alejandro Poire, security spokesman for the Mexican government, said Friday. Three other suspected criminals and two members of the Mexican navy also died in the fighting, he said. The Gulf cartel is one of Mexico's major drug-trafficking organizations. It is based in Matamoros, which is across the border from Brownsville, Texas. ""Today was another significant step in the destruction of criminal organizations that have done so much to damage the people of this country,"" Poire said. The University of Texas at Brownsville and Texas Southmost College canceled classes through Saturday and said it would rework several weekend events ""because of gunfire taking place across the Rio Grande."" Most of the students and faculty members have gone home, said Letty Fernandez, a university spokeswoman. The campus is about half a mile from the U.S.-Mexico border. Sgt. Reynaldo Trevino, with the university police, said he was working at a soccer game when he heard gunfire break out. He said the gunshots sounded so close it was ""like we were there."" More than 28,000 people have died in drug-related violence since Mexican President Felipe Calderon intensified the government's fight against cartels and organized crime after taking office in 2006, according to government figures. Authorities have scored a string of important wins against drug cartels recently. In September, officials arrested Sergio Villarreal, known to Mexican officials as ""El Grande,"" an alleged top leader of the Beltran Leyva cartel. His capture came soon after the August arrest of American-born ""La Barbie,"" or Edgar Valdez, thought to be one of Mexico's most ruthless drug traffickers. CNN's Janet DiGiacomo contributed to this report.","NEW: Three other suspected criminals and 2 members of the navy also die in the clash .

"(CNN) -- World Oceans Day, June 8, arrives this year at a time when people are especially focused on the safety of waters threatened by the Gulf oil disaster. Yet it is also a time when more people are committing to work to preserve the oceans than ever before. Among them is Roz Savage, who last week completed the third and final leg of her effort to row across the Pacific Ocean. Savage was one of dozens who took part in the Mission Blue cruise in April, organized by the nonprofit group TED to develop a strategy to save the oceans. In her talk on the Mission Blue cruise, taped before the final leg of her Pacific journey, Savage estimated that her trip across that ocean required more than 8,000 miles of rowing, spending 312 days on her own in a 23-foot rowboat. Savage is the first woman to row solo across the Pacific, from the West Coast of the United States to Papua New Guinea. (Maud Fontenoy rowed a shorter route from Peru to Polynesia in 2005.) Learn more about the ""Mission Blue Voyage"" Once a management consultant based in London, England, Savage says she knew from day one that the career wasn't right for her. But she didn't get serious about making a change until she was in her mid-30s. ""I sat down one day and wrote two versions of my own obituary, the one that I wanted, a life of adventure, and the one that I was actually heading for which was a nice, normal, pleasant life, but it wasn't where I wanted to be by the end of my life."" Watch a revealing look at the oceans' glory and shame . She wound up competing in the Atlantic Ocean rowing race, from the Canary Islands to Antigua, a 3,000-mile run. ""Sure, I had wanted to get outside of my comfort zone, but what I'd sort of failed to notice was that getting out of your comfort zone is, by definition, extremely uncomfortable. And my timing was not great either -- 2005, when I did the Atlantic, was the year of Hurricane Katrina. There were more tropical storms in the North Atlantic than ever before, since records began. And pretty early on those storms started making their presence known."" All four of her oars broke before she reached the halfway mark -- and Savage was forced to improvise using a boat hook and other equipment on the boat. The Mission Blue Voyage was a product of undersea explorer Sylvia Earle's 2009 TED Prize wish ""to ignite public support for a global network of Marine Protected Areas, hope spots large enough ... to restore the blue heart of the planet."" The Galapagos cruise attracted leading scientists and celebrities such as Glenn Close, Leonardo DiCaprio, Jackson Browne, Edward Norton, Elizabeth Banks, and Chevy Chase -- and resulted in $15 million in pledges to protect the seas and advocate for new policies. In her talk making the wish, Earle pointed out that in the past 50 years, 90 percent of the big fish in the oceans have been consumed and nearly half of the ocean's coral reefs have disappeared. Less than 1 percent of the ocean is protected from destructive fishing, and Earle believes the seas will go into irreversible decline unless a much larger portion -- some experts say as much as 30 percent -- is protected. Earle said the world needs to act swiftly to protect what she calls ""the blue heart of the planet that basically keeps us alive."" A filmmaker explains how he became fascinated with sea creatures . In Savage's view, the environmental problems the world faces don't result from the big incidents such as the Exxon Valdez or the Gulf oil disaster. ""Mostly it's been an accumulation of bad decisions by billions of individuals day after day and year after year. And, by the same token, we can turn that tide. We can start making better, wiser, more sustainable decisions. And when we do that, we're not just one person. Anything that we do spreads ripples. ""Other people will see, if you're in the supermarket line and you pull out your reusable grocery bag. Maybe if we all start doing this, we can make it socially unacceptable to say yes to plastic in the check-out line. That's just one example."" Watch other talks from Mission Blue . Savage's first effort to cross the Pacific ended in failure in 2007 when her boat capsized three times in 24 hours and she was rescued -- against her wishes. The next year, she completed the first leg, to Hawaii, but only after nearly running out of water. She managed to meet up with the crew of the ""Junk Raft,"" a boat made mostly of plastic water bottles that Savage said was built to call attention to ""the North Pacific garbage patch, that area in the North Pacific about twice the size of Texas, with an estimated 3.5 million tons of trash in it, circulating at the center of that North Pacific Gyre."" Earlier on that voyage, Savage said, the crew had caught a mahi mahi and found that its stomach was full of plastic. Savage wrote this post for CNN.com after her Pacific journey was completed: . In the couple of months since this TEDTalk was recorded, I have rowed 2,000 miles from Kiribati to Papua New Guinea in the third and final stage of my Pacific crossing, becoming the first woman to row solo all the way across the Pacific. During those two months the ocean has suffered new assaults -- notably the oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, but also smaller insults, as I have witnessed with my own eyes. On a beautiful calm day, with sunlight glinting off the waves, it is heartbreaking to see a plastic bottle floating on the water. Even thousands of miles from land, the ocean wilderness is no longer pristine. Mankind's impact is felt everywhere. When I have been alone for a long time at sea -- sometimes over a hundred days without seeing another human -- this evidence of our carelessness is especially jarring. There are times when I feel ashamed to be a human being, and feel obliged to apologize to the small community of fish that congregate beneath my boat for the mess we have made of their home. And it doesn't impact just the fish. Oceans cover 71 percent of the Earth, and are an integral part of our weather systems, climate control, and food supply. How can we have a healthy planet -- or healthy bodies -- if we don't have healthy oceans? I row across oceans to inspire people to take action on environmental issues. Something the ocean has taught me is that any challenge, no matter how huge, can be tackled if you break it down into little steps. Crossing the Pacific has taken me about 2.5 million oar strokes. One stroke doesn't get me very far, but you take all those tiny actions and you string them all together and you get across 8,000 miles of ocean. You can achieve almost anything, if you just take it one stroke at a time. And it's the same with saving the oceans. On a day like Oceans Day, when we feel part of a huge global community, it's easy to believe we can change the world. But there will be other days when maybe we feel alone, and that anything we do as individuals won't really make a difference -- that it's just a drop in the ocean. But every action counts. We all have it in our power to make a difference. In fact, we're already making a difference -- it's just up to us to decide if it's a good one or a bad one. Every time we say no to a plastic bag or refuse to drink bottled water, it matters. If I can row 8,000 miles to make a point about the state of our oceans, then you can do your part too. Start by going to http://ecoheroes.me/ and log a single green deed that you are going to do today, Oceans Day, to help save our seas. We have a lot of work to do, but the longest journey starts with a single step -- or oarstroke.","Roz Savage gave up a career as a management consultant to seek adventure .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- The latest eruption of Indonesia's Mount Merapi volcano, on Friday, killed at least 54 people and severely burned 78, hospital officials said. Bodies recovered from a village about 16 kilometers (9.9 miles) from the volcano were badly burned, Commissioner Tjiptono of the Yogyakarta police told a local station, TV One. Mount Merapi began its latest eruptions on October 26. Friday's victims bring the total to 93 killed. The volcano has not stopped erupting since Thursday, the Volcanology and Geological Disaster Management Office said. An explosion Thursday night could be heard 30 kilometers (18 miles) away, and it continued to spew ash clouds. Earlier, Mount Merapi had belched a steady stream of gas and ash, unleashing a pair of powerful eruptions into the morning sky on Thursday. The hot clouds hovered over central Java, rising up to 2.5 kilometers (1.5 miles) and then drifting to the south toward Kali Gendol, Kali Kuning, Kali Boyong, Kali Krasak and Kali Bedok, according to the Indonesian Volcanology and Geological Disaster Mitigation Disaster Agency. Those affected by the latest eruption lived outside the 15-kilometer (9-mile) evacuation radius that had been established. The danger zone was expanded to 20 kilometers (12 miles) after Friday's eruption. Residents of a village 12 kilometers (7.5 miles) from the volcano were ordered to move for safety, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, head of risk disaster reduction. Nearly 75,000 people have been evacuated, according to Indonesia's National Disaster Management Board. Residents on the volcano have repeatedly evacuated, but then returned to check on their houses and farm animals and fled anew with each fresh eruption. Because of rains, geological officials are warning residents and evacuees not to go to areas within the danger zone or near rivers. Rainfall can convert volcanic ash to lahar, or mudflow. There have been reports of mudflow headed down riverbeds on Merapi's slopes. The 3,000-meter (9,800-foot) Merapi is famously unpredictable. An eruption killed two people in 2006 and another killed more than 60 villagers in 1994. About 1,300 people died when Merapi erupted in 1930. In addition, last week, a 7.7-magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's coast, triggering a tsunami and killing at least 449 people. Hundreds more were injured.","NEW: 78 others have been severely burned .

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Former Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf has returned to the political stage in Pakistan, which he describes as a ""demoralized"" nation that needs an injection of vigor and leadership. Once one of the United States' strongest allies in the fight against terror, Musharraf on Friday launched a new political party in Pakistan as an alternative to an administration he says is now beset with serious problems. He cites widespread devastation caused by the spring flooding, a nose-diving economy, and a persistent extremist element, and said the current administration, which he calls corrupt, hasn't met those challenges. ""This is about leading, about support of the people and that's my strength,"" Musharraf said in a Connect the World interview with CNN's Becky Anderson. It is to be aired Friday. ""I don't see a political party out there now that is capable of bringing light back in the country. We need a new political culture that shuns dynasty politics,"" he says, saying that he wants a greater presence of women and minorities participating in the body politic. Musharraf resigned in 2008 as Pakistan's ruling coalition began taking steps to impeach him, and Asif Zardari, the widower of assassinated former Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, succeeded him. The former president said he has ""strong pockets"" of support and there is a ""huge clamor"" for his return. He said his Facebook page has more than 300,000 followers and he has raised $3 million for flood relief, and wants to attract the many people who don't vote to give him support. In fact, he contrasts what he says is the current administration's inadequate flood response to what he says was his proper reaction to earthquakes in Pakistan several years ago. ""We turned challenge into opportunity but they haven't done this,"" Musharraf said. One of the issues in Pakistan is the war in neighboring Afghanistan and the fight against militants in northwestern Pakistan who have been involved in the Afghan insurgency. Since the Obama administration entered office in the United States, drone strikes against militant targets in Pakistan have ramped up. Musharraf says he doesn't support drone strikes by foreign forces, but does back such actions by Pakistani troops.","Musharraf says he has ""strong pockets"" of support .

"(CNN) -- Australia's prime minister traveled to Afghanistan and met with the country's president on her first international trip since taking office. Prime Minister Julia Gillard also met with Australian troops serving in Afghanistan, her office said in a statement Sunday. In discussions with Afghan President Hamid Karzai and government ministers, Gillard ""underscored Australia's intention to continue working with the Afghan government to help meet its objectives to improve security, governance and development across the country,"" the statement said. Gillard also discussed plans to work with officials to transition to Afghan-led security with Gen. David Petraeus, the commander of NATO troops in Afghanistan, the statement said. The Afghanistan visit was the first of several stops on Gillard's first overseas trip since becoming prime minister, the statement said. She is also traveling to Zurich, Switzerland, to meet with FIFA officials about Australia's bid for the World Cup in 2018 and 2022. FIFA is the international football governing body. Later in the week, she will travel to Brussels, Belgium, for a conference discussing trade and security with leaders from Europe and Asia.","Prime Minister Julia Gillard also meets with Gen.

"Washington (CNN) -- The  Justice Department, as promised, moved Tuesday to block a court ruling  preventing use of government funds for embryonic stem cell  research. The lower-court decision that bars the use of publicly funded stem-cell work had stunned the Obama administration, which had vowed to appeal. ""The government is  seeking a stay of the court's injunction to prevent the irreparable human and  financial harm that could occur if these life-saving research projects are forced  to abruptly shut down,"" said Justice Department spokeswoman Tracy  Schmaler. ""The court's order causes  irrevocable harm to the millions of extremely sick or injured people who stand  to benefit from continuing research as well as to the taxpayers who have spent  hundreds of millions of dollars on this research,"" a Justice Department  statement said. The Justice lawyers  filed the notice of appeal and the proposed stay with U.S. District Court  Judge Royce Lamberth, who had granted the injunction sought by plaintiffs opposed  to research in which embryos had been destroyed. ""We've said from day one that embryonic  stem cell research is a top priority for this administration, and we're going to  do everything possible to prevent the potentially catastrophic  consequences of this injunction,"" said White House spokesman Reid Cherlin. The government said if  Lamberth has not granted the stay by September 7, the government would ""present  their stay request to the Court of Appeals the following day"". In that event, a  three-judge panel of the U.S. Circuit Court for the District of Columbia, would likely rule quickly  on the request for a stay, while it schedules briefs and arguments on the legal  merits of the case which may take months. Government lawyers filed  the appeal on behalf of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, the National Institutes  of Health, and its director, Francis Collins. Collins said NIH has  invested over $546 million in taxpayers' money in human embryonic stem cell  research since 2001. In a 12-page statement attached to the appeal, Collins  said the court order prevents NIH from providing $54 million in funds to 24  human embryonic research projects currently under way that were expecting to  receive funds within the next month. He said another 199 grants would be  discontinued for projects which were to be awarded funding after the September  30 deadline ordered by the court. Judge Lamberth had ruled  that all embryonic stem-cell research involves destroying embryos. He said a  provision of federal spending bills ""unambiguously prohibits the use of federal  funds for all research in which a human embryo is  destroyed"". The legal arguments with  which Lamberth sided were brought by researchers opposed to use of embryonic  stem cells. Plaintiffs included a group that seeks adoptive parents for human  embryos created through in vitro fertilization, the non-profit Christian  Medical Association and others. CNN Senior White House Correspondent Ed Henry contributed to this report.","NEW: ""Embryonic stem cell research is a top priority,"" White House says .

"Kabul, Afghanistan (CNN) -- Former warlords, village elders and women are among the members of an Afghan peace council designed to spearhead ""serious, substantive dialogue"" efforts with the Taliban opposition. The Afghan government Tuesday announced the members of the High Peace Council that will spearhead reconciliation efforts. ""They will be the sole body to take care of the peace talks and the government of Afghanistan will respect their mandate and will not try to create back channels or to try to duplicate the work of the high council for peace,"" Waheed Omar, Afghanistan's presidential spokesman, told CNN. A U.S.-led invasion overthrew the Taliban government after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks on the United States, carried out by the al Qaeda terror network, which was harbored by the Taliban. As the war ground on, talk emerged of contact between both sides. ""So far as contacts are concerned, yes -- over the past years there have been signs and signals from the armed opposition. There have been contacts on both sides but all of that remains on the level of contacts and signs and signals,"" Omar said. ""There is no substantive negotiations or substantive dialogue with the armed opposition. And we hope that after the establishment of the peace council which was established today, we will enter into a serious substantive dialogue with the opposition."" Sixty men, eight women and two other women still to be named will serve on the panel, which was set up to help end the long war between coalition and Afghan forces and militants from the Taliban. President Hamid Karzai recently announced the creation of the panel. The presence of women on the board is significant because the Taliban persecuted women when the movement controlled the country and have targeted institutions such as girls' schools during the insurgency. Rachel Reid, an analyst for Human Rights Watch, said the list contains ""too many names here that Afghans will associate with war crimes, warlordism and corruption."" ""This is a disappointing outcome for Afghan women and girls,"" said Reid. ""Women are once again being short-changed. The government had promised them more robust representation than this."" Omar said the group is ""large"" because the mandate is big. ""I'm sure that once the peace council starts working, they will have specialized groups working in different directions,"" he said.","Women are part of the Afghan peace council .
One analyst said too many names will have negative connotations .

"(CNN) -- A second-half penalty from David Villa proved enough to earn Barcelona a 1-1 draw at Rubin Kazan in Group D of the Champions League on Wednesday. The Spanish international striker scored from the spot on the hour mark after Andres Iniesta was fouled by Lasha Salukvadze in the penalty  area. Russian champions Rubin had themselves taken the lead from the penalty spot after half-an-hour, when Ecuadorian midfielder Christian Noboa lashed the ball past Victor Valdes after Daniel Alves was adjudged to have fouled Vitaly Kaleshin. With Lionel Messi back in the side after recovering from an ankle injury, the Spanish champions pressed for a winning goal and the Argentine nearly provided it, only for goalkeeper Sergei Ryzhikov to block his 71st minute shot. However, it was the hosts who nearly snatched all three points late on when Nigerian striker Obafemi Martins hit the post with a close-range header. Meanwhile, in the other Group D match, Danish champions Copenhagen claimed a superb 2-0 win at Panathinaikos, courtesy of goals from Martin Vingaard and Dame N'Doye, to lead the table with a maximum six points from their two matches. Barcelona are second on four points while Greek side Panathinaikos, who played most of the second half with 10 men following the dismissal of Brazilian midfielder Gilberto Silva, are bottom of the group having lost both of their matches. Meanwhile, in Group C, British sides Manchester United and Rangers both claimed vital 1-0 wins on Wednesday to lead the table with four points apiece. United came away from the Mestalla in Valencia with a superb late win courtesy of a breakaway goal from Mexican international striker Javier Fernandez. Meanwhile, in Glasgow, Steven Naismith sidefooted home a header from Kirk Broadfoot to see off Turkish side Bursaspor, who are bottom of the table with no points from their two matches.","Barcelona draw 1-1 at Rubin Kazan in Champions League Group D match .

"(CNN) -- Nicaragua's president is calling on U.S. authorities to investigate the death of a Nicaraguan diplomat as quickly as possible so his body can be returned home. Cesar Mercado, the consul of Nicaragua in New York, was found with his throat slashed in his apartment in the Bronx last week. ""We are asking for an investigation in the United States as soon as possible, to be able bring our fallen brother back to his birthplace ... for a Christian burial,"" President Daniel Ortega said at an event in Nicaragua's capital Saturday. Authorities have not said whether Mercado's death was a homicide or a suicide. ""The investigation is ongoing, and a final determination has not been reached,"" Paul Browne, deputy commissioner of the New York Police Department, told CNN Saturday. Mercado also suffered 12 stab wounds in the stomach, New York Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said Friday. Kelly described a ""hesitation wound"" in Mercado's neck, one that was not delivered in a single motion. That indicates the wound could have been self-inflicted, Kelly told reporters. ""The medical examiner has not determined whether or not this was a homicide,"" he said. ""If in fact there is a wound from an assailant, it is generally more direct and in one motion."" Police found a 12-inch steak knife beside a blood-filled bathroom sink and a second knife -- a 4- to 6-inch paring knife -- in the sink. ""There is a lot of blood in the apartment,"" he said, adding that police were analyzing fingerprints found in the blood. He said the autopsy on Mercado is complete and human hair was found in both of his hands -- 10 strands in the right hand and five in the left. It's not yet known whose hair it was. Police have found no evidence of forced entry or robbery. Security video cameras in the building were not working, Kelly said. Mercado, 34, was last seen alive Wednesday. His body was found just inside the door of a small, sixth-floor studio apartment in the Bronx on Thursday morning by a driver who had taken him to the United Nations the day before, Kelly said.

"(CNN) -- A stunning 30-yard strike from Andrea Pirlo sealed victory for AC Milan over Parma on Saturday night. The 1-0 win sends the 17-time Italian champions top of the league, one point ahead of rivals Inter and Lazio who both play Sunday. The winning margin could have been bigger had Zlatan Ibrahimovic converted one of several chances that came his way, but Pirlo's curling effort in the 25th minute was enough for Milan to claim all three points. Defeat for Parma -- their third this season in the league -- leaves them in 16th place and in danger of slipping into the bottom three after Sunday's matches have been completed. Bottom-placed Udinese recorded their first win of the season when Mehdi Benatia scored in the third minute of second half injury time to beat Cesena 1-0. In Spain, Valencia beat Athletic Bilbao 2-1 to maintain their unbeaten run in this season's La Liga. Aritz Aduriz's opened the scoring for the home team in the 11th minute with substitute Vicente all but sealing victory in injury time. Igor Gabilondo scored from a free-kick two minutes later but Valencia held on for the win. The result puts them four points ahead of their nearest rivals Villarreal and Barcelona at the top of the table. French striker Florent Sinama Pongolle scored twice in the space of five minutes as 10-man Real Zaragoza came from two behind to salvage a draw 2-2 at home to Sporting Gijon. Pongolle, on loan from Portuguese side Sporting Lisbon, struck in the 56th and 61st minute to cancel out an own goal from Ivan Obradovic in the first half and a penalty from Gijon winger Diego Castro in the 49th minute. The penalty was awarded after Zaragoza's Jiri Jarosik brought down Diego Barral in the penalty area, and was shown a red card. Zaragoza remain bottom of the table, while Sporting Gijon move up to 17th place. In La Liga's other Saturday fixture, Real Sociedad beat Espanyol 1-0 at home. The win came courtesy of an own goal by Argentine centre-back Juan Forlin in the 85th minute. Third-placed Barcelona host Real Mallorca on Sunday, Real Madrid will entertain Deportivo La Coruna.

He gave the speech yesterday at the Julia Masterman School in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and the president offered some suggestions that might sound familiar to you: do your homework, pay attention in class, show up on time. His main point was about the importance of education and to urge students to get the most out of their opportunities in school. Suzanne Malveaux was in Philadelphia for yesterday's speech. She has more on it for us right now. Suzanne? (BEGIN VIDEO) SUZANNE MALVEAUX, CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT: Hey, Carl. Well, President Obama picked Masterman School, one of the best schools here in Philadelphia, as the place to give his speech, his back-to-school speech for all the students around the country. Obviously, a lot of it was very encouraging, optimistic, encouraging students to pursue their education, that they are in control of their own destiny. The president also got personal, as well. We heard him talk about his own struggle with his identity when he was younger, being a product of a white mother and a black father, a father who was largely absent in his life. The president also talked about the fact that he wasn't always a good student; that he needed a little prodding from his own mother from time to time. And then, what was interesting, Carl, as well, the president talked about what it was like for young people and young students in the times, these hard economic times, and the mood of the country. Here's how the president related the two. U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: I know a lot of you are also feeling the strain of some difficult times. You know what's going on in the news and you also know what's going on in some of your own families. You've read about the war in Afghanistan. You hear about the recession that we've been through, and sometimes maybe you're seeing the worries in your parents' faces or sense it in their voice. (END VIDEO) Retail Sales Are Up . AZUZ: All right, well, for many Americans, back to school means back-to-school shopping. You've probably gotten most of yours done already. And experts think that is why retail sales were up last month. Around $363 billion in sales during the month of August. That is up .4 percent from July, and it's up 3.6 percent from last August. Could be a good sign for the economy. Back-to-school spending can give an idea of how holiday spending might go. But some analysts are saying don't jump the gun just yet. They point out that while spending is up a little bit, people are still holding back because of concerns about -- you guessed it -- the economy. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS:  Time for the Shoutout! What determines which way hurricanes rotate? If you think you know it, then shout it out! Is it the: A) Doppler Effect, B) Heisenberg Principle, C) Coriolis Effect or D) Butterfly Effect? You've got three seconds -- GO! The Coriolis Effect has to do with the earth's rotation; it deflects winds in certain directions in different hemispheres. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Igor . AZUZ: This image you see over my shoulder is one of the scarier images we've had on CNN Student News. It's Hurricane Igor, what the thing looks like from space. That opening in the middle there is the eye of the storm. And you see how the winds are turning counter-clockwise here around the eye? That's because of the Coriolis Effect. These pictures are amazing. They're from a satellite called the GOES-15. They give you an idea of just how big this storm is. It started out as a tropical storm on Saturday. Yesterday afternoon, it was a category 4 hurricane. So it's not only big, it got big fast. Forecasters think it will stay out in the ocean. But because the thing is so massive, Igor could cause some severe conditions for parts of the Caribbean. Gas Line Fire . AZUZ: Remember that fire we told you about on Monday that came from a gas line in San Bruno, California? The gas company, Pacific Gas and Electric, says it'll pay up to $100 million to help the people who lost their homes. The company's president said he knows that money can't return lives or restore memories, but that he's committed to helping rebuild. Now, we want you to check out this surveillance video. This was taken on the day of the fire at a store about a quarter mile away. At first, people just stop what they're doing. Then, they start running for the exits. And you can actually see -- take a look at this -- you can see the doors being blown in by the force of the explosion when the fire started. Burqa Ban in France . AZUZ: In France, there's a new law that'll go into effect next Spring. The parliament approved it by a wide margin in July. The French Senate passed it yesterday 246-1, with 100 politicians choosing not to vote. The French people are in favor of the new law by four to one. What is this? It's a ban. On burqas. That's what you see here, those full body coverings that some Muslim women wear. Actually, this new law bans any veil that covers your face. The lawmakers say those veils, including the burqas, deny equality. A French council that offers advice on laws says this ban might be unconstitutional. Is This Legit? APRIL WILLIAMS, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Is this legit? Hispanic Heritage Month starts on the first of October. Not legit! It actually starts on September 15 and runs through October 15. Hispanic Heritage Month . AZUZ: Now, you might be wondering why Hispanic Heritage Month starts in the middle of a month. It's because the celebration started out as Hispanic Heritage Week. It was established by former President Lyndon Johnson in 1968. The week always included September 15th, because seven Latin American countries celebrate their independence around that time: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Mexico and Chile. In 1988, the week was expanded into Hispanic Heritage Month, starting on September 15th and ending on October 15th. It's a time to celebrate the culture and traditions of Americans from Spanish-speaking countries and to honor their contributions to American society. Free Teacher Materials .

AZUZ: We're gonna talk about science fiction for a minute now. Star Wars, Star Trek, Avatar: All these are about life on other planets. Well, scientists say they've discovered new species right here on Earth. These things are out in the ocean, down in deep areas that, until now, had never been explored. Claire Nouvian is a conservationist. She talks about what's been found down in the deep. (BEGIN VIDEO) CLAIRE NOUVIAN, CONSERVATIONIST AND AUTHOR OF ""THE DEEP"": The inspiration behind the book ""The Deep"" that I wrote is really clear, because it happened one day, and that was when I visited the Monterey Bay Aquarium in California which, to my standards, is the most beautiful aquarium in the world. My life just completely changed afterwards. I flew back and all I could see were images of these creatures in my mind, and I just wanted to go home and tell everyone, tell the whole world! I felt like we had been looking for alien life on other planets for so long, and I felt we were wrong. Alien life is exactly here. It's on this planet. It's just in the deep ocean. So, I felt I needed to share my excitement and wonder. I must say I've got a soft point for invertebrates. So, animals without a back bone. You know, deep sea fin octopus, those that we call dumbo octopuses. And they are pink or orangey, and they've got big fins, but they look like big ears, so that's why we call them dumbos. So, when you go down with the submersible, you go down through the water column. And if you turn your lights off, you disturb all these animals, right, and so they all emit light. So, you look through the portal and it's much better than watching the sky, because there's so much going on. It's not static at all. Some light is just very, very instantaneous, sort of clicks or flashes. And others is continuous, sort of strings of light that disappear in the distance. It's just spectacular, spectacular. (END VIDEO) Before We Go . AZUZ: Spectacular indeed. Before we go, a tale of another interesting creature. This one is a baby squirrel. Kinda cute. The only thing that could make this any cuter is if it were next to a kitten. Perfect. We did not set this up. The two are siblings, sort of. The kitten's mom adopted the squirrel when it fell out of its nest. Now, it's being raised like a cat! The squirrel seems happy to go along. It's even started purring. Goodbye . AZUZ: Not getting at all squirrelly about the idea of having a cat family. In fact, they sound like a purrfect family. And that will be all the time we have for meow. Hope you have a great day.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- India has rejected findings of British scientists about a new form of drug-resistant ""superbug"" infecting patients who have traveled to the South Asian nation for treatment. The Indian health ministry insisted in a written statement Thursday that such organisms were present universally. ""[T]his is a phenomenon which occurs in nature -- in the environment, may be intestines of humans and animals universally. There might be billions of such happenings at any moment,"" the ministry said. Health authorities in the country, seen as a cost-effective destination for foreign medical tourists, claimed similar plasmids have been reported from the United States, Israel and Greece as well. Medical tourists bring home new superbug . ""While such organisms may be circulating more commonly in the world due to international travel but to link this with the safety of surgery hospitals in India and citing isolated examples to show that due to presence of such organism in Indian environment, India is not a safe place to visit is wrong,"" the ministry said. It also objected to the naming of the superbug as New Delhi metallo-lactamase-1 and dismissed claims Indian hospitals were not safe for treatment. The medical journal, The Lancet, said this week that tourists seeking treatment in Asia are bringing home a dangerous type of bacterial infection that's resistant to nearly all known antibiotics. Doctors identified 29 patients in the United Kingdom with the new infections. Most had traveled to India, Pakistan or Bangladesh for medical procedures, including elective cosmetic surgery. Dozens of patients from Asia also got the infections, according to the researchers from Cardiff University. The new strains appear to be widespread in south Asian medical centers and have also been spotted in Canada, Australia, the Netherlands, Sweden and the United States. In June, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) flagged three cases where patients were infected with bacteria carrying the NDM-1 gene. All had undergone medical care in India. CNN's Harmeet Shah Singh contributed to this report.","India says such organisms are present everywhere .

"(CNN) -- World number two Roger Federer continued his perfect start to the U.S. Open, brushing aside Germany's Andreas Beck 6-3 6-4 6-3 on the Arthur Ashe Center Court. The Swiss, who won the Flushing Meadows tournament five times in a row between 2004 and 2008, is yet to drop a set at the New York event. Last year's beaten finalist took just one hour and 41 minutes to defeat Beck and will face France's unseeded Paul-Henri Mathieu in the third round, who carded a 7-6 6-4 6-3 victory over compatriot Guillaume Rufin. Number three seed Novak Djokovic had to contend with crowd trouble on center court to overcome Philipp Petzschner, taking the match 7-5 6-3 7-6. The incident occurred in the eighth game of the opening set, when there was a disturbance in the stands as Djokovic was set to claim the first service break of the match. According to the New York Times, a fight broke our between a male fan and two spectators, a woman in her 40's and an elderly man. The row culminated with both men falling over two rows of seats before the three individuals involved were handcuffed and taken to a local police station. The 23-year-old Djokovic noticed the incident and told the newspaper: ""It was far away from the court; we couldn't really see what was going on. I hope it was no Serbian up there."" Petzschner recovered to hold his serve, but Serbia's Djokovic got his break in the final game of the set to claim a straight-sets victory. Russia's Nikolay Davydenko was stunned by Richard Gasquet, losing 6-3 6-4 6-2 to the Frenchman, who is ranked 38 in the world. The fifth seed is the highest placed player to be eliminated so far in New York, and he was joined by fellow seed Marin Cilic, who also tasted defeat on day four. Number 11 seed Cilic was undone by Kei Nishikori of Japan, eventually losing a five-set epic 5-7 7-6 3-6 7-6 6-1. In a match lasting just under five hours, Croatia's Cilic took the opening set before Nishikori leveled the match courtesy of a second-set tie break. It was a similar story for the next two sets, with Cilic claiming a comfortable win in the third, only for world number 147 Nishikori to pick up another tie break success in the fourth before crushing his higher-ranked opponent in the final set. There were no such problems for Robin Soderling, who swept aside home crowd favorite Taylor Dent in a 6-2 6-2 6-4 win. The fifth seed was a man in a hurry, defeating the unseeded American in one hour and 32 minutes. There was reason to cheer for the home crowd, with New York native James Blake advancing to the third round at the expense of Canada's Peter Polansky. The former world number four took the match in four sets, recovering from one set down to seal a 6-7 6-3 6-2 6-4 triumph.","Number two seed Roger Federer defeats Andreas Beck in straight sets .

"(CNN) -- Cases of disease are increasing in flood-ravaged Pakistan, but international relief funding for the disaster is drying up, the Oxfam aid organization said Friday. ""When the world's attention was focused on Pakistan's flood victims, there was a chance of seeing substantial aid being delivered. But as the worst of the flood waters have receded, so has the promise of significant funding,"" Neva Khan, Oxfam's director in Pakistan, said in a statement. But donations are still crucial to help people survive, the organization said. Three months after the devastating flooding, large areas in the southern province of Sindh remain underwater, and 7 million people are ""still without adequate shelter."" ""While the response from some donors and the public has been generous, the U.N.'s Pakistan flood appeal for just over $2 billion, is only 38 percent funded,"" the organization said. Citing United Nations figures, Oxfam said 10 million people need immediate food assistance. ""The funding shortfall is so serious that existing regular food rations to 3.5 million people could be in jeopardy,"" the organization said. The floods caused $9.7 billion in damage to homes, roads, farms and other parts of the southwestern Asian country, according to estimates from the World Bank and Asian Development Bank. The flooding began in early August, and flood waters continued to rage in the countryside more than seven weeks later. More than 1,700 people died due to the flooding, according to Pakistani authorities, while more than 20 million were displaced. The rushing waters washed out large swaths of farmland, destroying crops and families' livelihoods. ""The water is six feet high. No one will be able to plant anything,"" said Mohamad Razi, 19, according to Oxfam. ""We should be planting next month, but we will have to wait a year."" The Sindh province resident, who is staying at a relief camp, said many have no choice but to rely on assistance from others. ""We have to depend on the government for help. We have nothing here,"" he said. Last week, United States officials announced a $2 billion, multiyear security assistance package to help Pakistan fight extremists taking refuge in safe havens along its border with Afghanistan -- noting that the Pakistani military is stretched thin dealing with flood disaster relief.","Oxfam says large areas in Sindh province remain underwater .

"(CNN) -- If every end results in a new beginning, then the start of the next race for the White House begins now. With the midterm elections barely behind them, the dozen or more possible contenders for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination no longer have to keep up the charade that all of their activity on the campaign trail over the past couple of months was solely about helping fellow Republicans this year and had nothing to do with the next race for the White House. Among those considering presidential bids who were criss-crossing the country were Mississippi governor and Republican Governors Association chairman Haley Barbour, who made a five-day, 13-state swing in support of GOP gubernatorial candidates; former Massachusetts governor and 2008 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who campaigned for Republicans in 25 states since August; Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty, who made a seven-day eight-state tour; and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who finished up a 12-state, two-week tour. Other potential White House hopefuls on the campaign trail this fall for fellow Republicans: Sen. John Thune of South Dakota; former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania; former Arkansas governor and 2008 GOP presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, now a talk-show host; Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana; Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, who also ran for his party's last presidential nomination; and former Alaska governor and 2008 vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin. For those thinking about bidding for the White House, the midterms served partially as a pregame show. ""Potential 2012 candidates can point to their 2010 travel and fundraising efforts when they're asked 'Where were you when we needed you?' by elected Republicans and activists whose support they're courting in caucuses and primaries just over a year from now,"" says Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who was national press secretary for Romney's 2008 presidential campaign. So does the end of the 2010 election cycle mean that those interested in running for the White House will immediately launch bids? Yes and no. Many of the bigger names who may announce a bid for the presidency have said they won't decide on a White House run until early next year. But some of the lesser-known candidates may launch exploratory committees soon after the midterms, as some did in the last cycle. And get ready for a pickup in the frequency of 2012 presidential polling. ""We all probably agree it will be too soon to start speculating about 2012 starting on November 3, but that won't stop folks from doing it anyway,"" Madden said. While many Republican hopefuls may not immediately declare themselves as candidates, what will be felt immediately in the battle for the GOP presidential nomination is the effect of the Tea Party movement. ""Hard-charging Tea Party candidates came out of nowhere, beat out establishment GOP candidates in the primaries, and won general election contests. That's a wake-up call for Republican establishment candidates for president,"" says CNN contributor and Republican strategist Alex Castellanos. While the Tea Party added energy and enthusiasm to the GOP, it may have also changed the way the Republicans choose their presidential nominee. ""We always pick the guy who ran last time and nearly won. The election may have turned that dynamic on its head,"" Castellanos said.

"London, England (CNN) -- British police Friday questioned three players from the Pakistani national cricket team at the center of an alleged betting scandal that has rocked the sport. Their attorney, Elizabeth Robertson, said that Mohammed Amir, Mohammad Asif and team captain Salman Butt appeared at the Kilburn Police station voluntarily to answer questions. ""At no time were they placed under arrest. They were free to leave any time and they have answered all of the questions that were put to them and have been released without charge or conditions,"" Robertson said. Metropolitan Police said that their investigation is not complete and that the three players could be called back for further questioning. Police launched a criminal investigation after the British tabloid News of the World first reported the allegations Sunday. It claimed two players were involved in spot-fixing during Pakistan's Test series with England last week. Spot-fixing involves deliberately throwing parts of a game, rather than the whole match. The paper alleged the players deliberately bowled ""no balls,"" or fouls, at specific points in the game and that the alleged ringleader pocketed 150,000 pounds (about $230,000) in the scam. Cricket's governing body, the International Cricket Council, provisionally suspended Amir, Asif and Butt on Thursday night and charged them with various offenses in the ICC's anti-corruption code. The ICC would not give details of the charges, but said they come from the code's Article 2, which relates to fixing or influencing cricket matches, and to bribes and betting on the game. Robertson said Pakistan's cricket organization and the three players were cooperating with both the police and ICC investigations and would continue to do so. ""They look forward to a timely and satisfactory outcome,"" she said, adding that there would be no further comment. Ronnie Flanagan, who heads the ICC's anti-corruption unit, cautioned that the players have not been found guilty. ""We think we have arrived at a position where certainly players have a case to answer,"" Flanagan said at a news conference in London on Friday. If found guilty, the players would face a possible lifetime ban, ICC Chief Executive Haroon Lorgat said. The players may appeal the ICC's decision. The ICC has said it is in close contact with police. Lorgat told reporters he does not believe the incident reflects a more widespread problem, and Flanagan thanked the tabloid for exposing possible corruption. ""If these charges are proven, I congratulate what the News of the World has done in bringing that to light,"" he said. Police already questioned the three players once this week, said team manager Yawar Saeed, who was also questioned. Several people have been arrested in connection with the case. The Met Police arrested a 35-year-old man late Saturday on suspicion of conspiracy to defraud bookmakers and released him on bail Sunday, and customs officials arrested three people Sunday on suspicion of money laundering.","NEW: Three accused players voluntarily submit to police questioning .

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- San Francisco city officials are readying to ban most of McDonald's Happy Meals in current form because they offer toys to entice kids to buy meals not meeting nutritional criteria. Under a proposal given preliminary approval this week, McDonald's and other restaurants would have until December 2011 to improve their meals' nutrition with fruits and vegetables -- if the chains want to keep offering Captain America figurines or toys tied with latest films. The proposed ordinance is part of a ""food justice movement"" and is designed to address how about 50 of the city's restaurants use giveaway toys to sell fast food whose nutritional content is being challenged by the city. Officials said they hope their measure, the first of its kind for a large city, would encourage similar standards across the country. The San Francisco proposal was modeled after a similar law for unincorporated Santa Clara County, California, . San Francisco Supervisor Eric Mar, who initiated the proposal, said the ordinance would be ""a tremendous victory"" in fighting childhood obesity. His fifth-grade daughter is in the 6-to-11 age group in which rates of obesity have quadrupled the past 30 years -- coinciding with the life span of the Happy Meal, he said. ""I do believe that toys and other incentives attached to foods that are high in sugar, fat and calories are a major reason for the alarming rise for childhood obesity in this country,"" Mar said. ""This is a very modest ordinance that is an incentive for the industry to take responsibility for healthier choices for children and parents."" McDonald's spokeswoman Danya Proud said the company was ""extremely disappointed with the decision."" ""It's not what our customers want, nor is it something they asked for. Public opinion continues to be overwhelmingly against this misguided legislation,"" Proud said in a statement. ""Parents tell us it's their right and responsibility -- not the government's - to make their own decisions and to choose what's right for their children. ""We are extremely proud of our Happy Meals which give our youngest guests wholesome food and toys of the highest quality. Getting a toy with a kid's meal is just one part of a fun, family experience at McDonald's,"" Proud said. The board of supervisors approved the ordinance in a first reading Tuesday, by a veto-proof margin. Next Tuesday, November 9, the board is expected to formally approve the measure in a final reading, Mar said. Mayor Gavin Newsom has indicated he would veto the ordinance, but the board has enough votes -- eight out of 11 -- to override the veto, Mar said. Under the proposal, the food and beverage would have to contain fewer than 600 calories, and less than 35 percent of total calories would come from fat. The meal would also have to contain 0.5 cups of fruit and 0.75 cups of vegetables and offer less than 640 mg of sodium and less than 0.5 mg of trans fat. Breakfast would have the option of offering 0.5 cups of fruit or vegetables. City officials expect a legal challenge from McDonald's once the ordinance is approved. ""They hired fancy lawyers for this and flew them out here to meet with us and basically to strong-arm us into not doing this,"" Linshao Chin, legislative assistant to Mar, said. She said McDonald's attorneys argued corporate First Amendment rights. McDonald's declined to respond to Chin's comments. McDonald's, Burger King and Subway are among the restaurants that offer such toys or other incentives in San Francisco, but McDonald's was described by city officials as taking the lead in opposing the ordinance. The California Restaurant Association also objected to the ordinance because, said spokesman Daniel Conway, ""it's insulting to parents and it's more generating headlines than trimming waist lines."" ""There's been absolutely no proof that this will impact the way people eat,"" Conway said. ""There's enough ambiguity over crayons and things like that, it has somewhat of a chilling effect. It has raised concerns for restaurateurs of all varieties and segments of the industry."" San Francisco officials compromised on some draft measures in response to McDonald's concerns, such as delaying the proposed enforcement for more than a year to accommodate the chain's schedule for menu changes, Chin said. ""We did have an amendment that these meals needed to include whole grains, and McDonald's said they were not able to meet that requirement because if they added whole grains into their hamburger buns, their buns would crumble. They said that was something that was too strict, so we removed it,"" Chin said. San Francisco officials are hoping that the ordinance would force fast-food chains to replace fries and soda with apple slices and milk. ""We hope that this would have a ripple effect, that this is a small step in the food justice movement,"" Chin said. ""We have places all across the country that are known as food deserts. You can't find a supermarket, but you can find fast-food restaurants. ""Even hearing from the McDonald's nutritionist, they were saying that this food even in moderation was OK,"" Chin said, ""but I think it completely discounts how there are some people eating it every day, and there are poor people who rely on it as a food source because it's cheap."" A free toy can be effective on children. ""From personal experience as a child myself, you watch a movie and you walk by a restaurant and they're offering a toy from the latest movie, and you know you want to get that toy,"" Chin said. ""The children are pestering their parents to take them in there and get that toy. It's something that's pretty hard to resist for a 3-year-old. ""So this is incentivizing children to eat these unhealthy meals with the toys,"" she said.","Ordinance would require most McDonald's Happy Meals to meet new city nutrition criteria .
If nutrition standards are met, McDonald's and other chains can offer toys with meals .
Not meeting the criteria would result in pulling restaurant's permit to operate .

"(CNN)  -- Real Madrid took a giant stride towards the knockout stage of the Champions League with a 1-0 win over Auxerre for their second straight win in the tough Group G on Tuesday night. A late goal from substitute Angel di Maria sealed the points for Jose Mourinho's men who beat Ajax Amsterdam 2-0 in the Bernabeu in their group opener. The visitors had dominated the game and created a series of chances, but  looked set for another goalless draw until di Maria struck with nine minutes left. The Argentine winger controlled a right-wing cross on his chest before volleying home. Auxerre had offered precious little in attack but moments before Real defender Pepe's header struck his own post and bounced clear. The win leaves them with six points from two games, two clear of AC Milan, who drew 1-1 with Ajax in the other match played Tuesday in a group of three teams with illustrious records in the competition. Former Ajax striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic dealt his old side a blow with Milan's equalizer -- his third in the tournament having scored twice in the opening 2-0 win over Auxerre. The Swede combined with Clarence Seedorf to pull them level in the 37th minute. Ajax had gone ahead in the 23rd minute, with Uruguay international Luis Suarez playing a vital part as he foxed Alessandro Nesta before sending a low cross for Moroccan international Mounir El Hamdaoui to score past past Milan goalkeeper Christian Abbiati. In Group H, Arsenal and Shakhtar Donetsk are forging clear after two straight wins apiece. Arsenal scored a thrilling 3-1 victory at 10-man Partizan Belgrade, while Ukrainian side Shakhtar were equally convincing 3-0 winners against Braga. Arsene Wenger's Arsenal were coming off a shock 3-2 defeat to West Brom in the English Premier League on Saturday but survived some scares for a comfortable win. Man of the match Jack Wilshere brilliantly set up Andrey Arshavin to give them a 15th minute but Partizan draw level against the run of play through Brazil-born striker Cleo from the spot. Partizan Marko Jovanovic lost early in the second-half as he conceded a penalty but Arshavin saw his penalty saved by goalkeeper Vladimir Stojkovic before striker Marouane Chamakh put them ahead again on 71 minutes. Sebastien Squillaci nodded home substitute Samir Nasri's corner to make it 3-1 in the 82nd minute before the underfire Lukasz Fabianski dived to his right to save Cleo's late penalty for Partizan. Shakhtar's Brazilian stars Douglas Costa and Luiz Adriano were key to their win as Braga, thrashed 6-0 at Arsenal in the first match, lost heavily on their home ground. Costa set up his teammate and compatriot for the first two goals and added the third from the spot in the last minute when converted after Paulo Cesar had fouled Willian in the area.","Real Madrid beat Auxerre 1-0 for second successive win in Group G .

"Jakarta, Indonesia (CNN) -- An Islamic cleric was arrested Monday for playing a key role in the establishment of a militant training camp in Indonesia's Aceh region, authorities said. Abu Bakar Bashir -- a religious leader known for his anti-Western rhetoric -- has been arrested twice previously for his activities in connection with militant groups. He was detained early Monday in West Java and was later brought to the National Police Headquarters for further questioning. Authorities have strong evidence that Bashir played a role in establishing a terror cell and a militant training camp in Aceh province, said National Police spokesman Inspector General Edward Aritonang. Police raided that camp in February and arrested dozens of militants who were allegedly planning terror attacks in Indonesia similar to those that took place in Mumbai, India, in 2008. Bashir knew about that camp, helped fund it and appointed religious teachers to provide the militants with spiritual guidance, officials said. He also allegedly appointed an extremist fugitive known as Dulmatin as the field commander. Dulmatin was killed in another police raid shortly afterward. In May, several members of a hardline organization Bashir founded --  the Jama'ah Ansharut Tauhid, or JAT -- were also arrested and charged with raising funds for the training camp. Following months of speculation on Bashir's involvement, police said it's clear he played a key role in setting up the terror sell that wanted to base itself in Aceh. Police also uncovered a new plot by a terror cell to launch fresh attacks on the national police headquarters and several unnamed hotels and embassies in Jakarta. This information came about after the arrests of four people over the weekend in West Java. And police said the terror cell put up a laboratory to test bombs and twice blew up explosives in a remote area in Sumedang, West Java. A French national allegedly supplied a car to the suspected terrorists to use for a car bomb, according to authorities. The French national is still at large. Bashir was first arrested after the Bali bombings in 2002 where more than 200 people were killed. At the time, he was the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, whose stated goal is to create an Islamic state comprising Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia and the southern Philippines. He was charged with rebellion, terrorism and immigration violations. Prosecutors convicted of him of immigration violations and rebellion, but the latter conviction dismissed on appeal. Bashir served 18 months in jail. Two years later, before his expected release in 2004, Bashir was arrested again on charges of helping incite the August 2003 bombing of the Marriott hotel in Jakarta. He served two and a half years in jail and was released in June 2006. In 2008, Bashir established Jama'ah Ansharut Tauhid. ""I'm sure the police have a very strong case. They would not arrest him for the third time otherwise,"" said terrorism expert Sidney Jones of the International Crisis Group, a non-profit that works to prevent and resolve deadly conflict. ""It's a mark of police confidence that they would go forward with this arrest, and attests to the weakening of the radical networks. But Abu Bakar Bashir's influence has been declining. So, the fact that he's been taken out of circulation again will not have a major impact one way or another on the security situation.""","Police: Bashir funded and approved of a terror plot .

"Baghdad, Iraq (CNN) -- Tariq Aziz, formerly Saddam Hussein's top diplomat, who has been in U.S. custody in Iraq, has been transferred to the custody of the Iraqi government, an Iraqi official said Wednesday. Aziz was handed over on Monday from Camp Cropper and is being held at Kadhimiya prison in Baghdad, Boshu Ibrahim, deputy Justice minister, told CNN. This move comes as Camp Cropper, the last major U.S. detention facility in Iraq is being officially handed over to the Iraqi government on Thursday. Serving a 15-year sentence, Aziz was part of a transfer of more than two dozen former Saddam Hussein regime members, 26 on Monday and three last month. Aziz, who has been hospitalized a number of times while in custody, has been in poor health, and his lawyers and family members have voiced their concerns about his handover to the Iraqi government and how we would be treated while in their custody. Ibrahim said that the Ministry of Justice detention facilities provide health care for inmates and Kadhimiya prison has a clinic. He said if needed the detainees could be taken to medical facilities elsewhere. Aziz was one of the best-known faces of Hussein's government, serving as deputy prime minister from 1981 to 2003 and as foreign minister for part of that time. In March 2009, he was sentenced in connection with the 1992 executions of 42 merchants. He was captured by U.S. forces in April 2003, shortly after the U.S.-led invasion that toppled the Hussein regime. According to Boshu, being former regime members will not affect the way Aziz will be treated by Iraqi authorities.","Tariq Aziz was a face of the Hussein regime .

"(CNN) -- Kenya's David Lekuta Rudisha has broken the 13-year-old men's 800 meter world record at Berlin's Diamond League meeting on Sunday. Rudisha clocked a time of one minute 41.09 second to shave two hundredths of a second off the time set by compatriot Wilson Kipketer in August 1997. The 21-year-old had gone close to breaking the record last month in Huesden- Zolder, Belgium, when he clocked 1:41.51, the second fastest time in history behind Kipketer. ""Now that I have run that time, I can say I have the ability to improve and go faster,"" Rudisha told reporters. Meanwhile, in the women's 800m, world champion Caster Semenya continued her comeback with victory in a time a season's best time of one minute 59.90 seconds. The  19-year-old South African -- returning to the scene of her world title victory last year -- was running for only the third time since being cleared to race again following gender tests. ""It feels good to be back in Berlin. My goal was to run under two minutes and I achieved that,"" Semenya told reporters.

"(CNN) -- Afghan and coalition soldiers killed more than 30 insurgents, including 13 would-be suicide bombers, as they fought off assaults on two military bases and government buildings in eastern Afghanistan, the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) said on Sunday. The attacks, which happened Saturday morning, were led by Haqqani network insurgents and were against Forward Operating Base Salerno and Forward Operating Base Chapman, ISAF said. Both bases are located in Khost province, a volatile region on Afghanistan's rugged border with Pakistan. The Haqqani network is a militant group with ties to al Qaeda. Insurgents clad in U.S. military uniforms and wielding rocket-propelled grenades and small arms launched simultaneous attacks on the two bases, ISAF said. ISAF had previously reported more than 20 insurgents had died in the fighting. Thirteen of the insurgents killed were wearing suicide vests, ISAF said, adding that Afghan and coalition soldiers followed up on intelligence tips and later captured a commander involved in planning the attacks. ""The insurgents' attempts to attack ISAF or Afghan government facilities were defeated again. The insurgent leadership who direct these ill-conceived attacks far from the actual battlefield knows their low-level fighters have no chance of success against these targets,"" Brig. Gen. Josef Blotz, an ISAF spokesman, said in a statement. Separately on Sunday, ISAF said Afghan and international forces captured a senior Taliban commander in Logar province. Zia Ul-Haq is accused of helping foreign fighters and suicide bombers get into the capital, Kabul. He was captured along with a sub-commander and another insurgent on Wednesday, ISAF said in a statement. Chapman is the same base where a suicide bomber killed seven CIA officers late last year.","Thirteen would-be suicide bombers killed in simultaneous assaults on military bases .

THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: It's the start of a new month, the start of the government's fiscal year -- we'll explain why that one's important in a second -- and of course, it is the most awesome day of the week. I'm Carl Azuz. Let's get started. First Up: Budget Deadline . AZUZ: First up, Congress votes to keep the government running, at least for another two months.  Here's the deal: The government has a budget for every fiscal, or financial year, which starts on October 1st. The budget says where different money goes and how it's spent. Congress has to pass that budget; they haven't done that yet. Without a budget, the government would shut down. So this week, Congress passed what's called a stop-gap measure. That's going to keep things running for two months. Some people say that Congress only passed the stop-gap to avoid tough questions from voters. This is an election year and it might be hard to get re-elected if you have to explain why you voted against the budget and let the government shut down. Other folks are upset that Congress wouldn't stick around to work on the budget. After they passed the stop-gap, most Congressmen and women headed home to campaign. These budget delays aren't a new thing though. Over the last 35 years, Congress has missed the October 1st deadline more often than it's made it. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Hudgins' 8th grade World History class at Opelika Middle School in Opelika, Alabama! What is the second most populated country in the world? Is it: A) India, B) China, C) Russia or D) the United States? You've got three seconds -- GO! With more than one billion people, India is second on the list, right behind China. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! Holy Site Divided . AZUZ: Most of that population, around 80 percent, follows the Hindu religion. There are also more than 160 million Muslims in India. And those two groups -- plus one smaller religious group -- have been fighting over a holy site in India. All three groups say it should belong to them. Yesterday, a court ruling ordered the groups to divide up the site. India's government sent out extra security forces after the decision to try and keep things calm. In the past, the fighting over this holy site has led to violence in different parts of the country. Sara Sidner explains how this fight started. (BEGIN VIDEO) SARA SIDNER, CNN CORRESPONDENT, NEW DELHI: The legal battle over this piece of land in Ayodhya, India has spanned more than a century. The bitter dispute pits Hindus against Muslims and has sparked some of the deadliest riots the country has experienced since partition. MUSHIRUL HASAN, DIRECTOR GENERAL OF ARCHIVES: Ayodhya has captured the imaginations of the people in and around that region for well over 150 years. For the first time after independence though, the problem surfaced in 1949 when an idol was placed in the mosque. SIDNER: The main fight is over who is entitled to this piece of land some consider sacred. In the 1500s, a mosque was built on the site by India's then Muslim rulers. But Hindus believe long before the mosque was constructed, a temple stood to mark the birthplace of one of their most adored Hindu dieties, Lord Ram. (END VIDEO) This Day in History .

And a light-year, the distance that light can travel in one year, is around 5.8 trillion miles. New Planet Discovered . AZUZ: Scientists say a newly discovered planet that's about 20 light years away from Earth could be the closest thing they've found out there so far to our home world. It's called Gliese 581g and this is an artist's conception of what it looks like. The red thing is a dwarf star. Gliese 581g orbits the star kinda like the Earth orbits the sun. The similarities don't stop there. Experts think this planet has enough gravity to keep an atmosphere around it. They say there's also a good chance that there's water on the planet. But, there is at least one difference and it's pretty significant. One of the scientists who discovered the planet explains. STEVEN VOGT, UNIV. OF CALIFORNIA, SANTA CRUZ: This planet doesn't have days and nights. Wherever you are on this planet, the sun is in the same position, or the star is in the same position all the time. So, it keeps one side facing towards the star, and that's fairly warm. And the other side is in perpetual nighttime. The Enviropig . AZUZ: Sticking with the science theme, people are always looking for ways to help this planet. Well, some scientists are squealing about an idea that involves pigs. You've heard of green eggs and ham. Take out the eggs. Allan Chernoff introduces us to enviropig! (BEGIN VIDEO) ALLAN CHERNOFF, CNN SR. CORRESPONDENT: It looks just like a pig. PROF. RICHARD MOCCIA, UNIVERSITY OF GUELPH: It looks, sounds, acts identical to a normal Yorkshire pig. CHERNOFF: But it is different genetically. To create this pig, scientists here added an E. coli bacteria gene and mouse DNA to a normal pig embryo. They call it an enviropig. I mean, actually, the idea is that someone like this could end up on a dinner plate. MOCCIA: Certainly, one of the goals of the technology is to produce a pig which could be consumed by humans and enter the food chain. We have done extensive testing, though, on the various internal organs and different meat cuts from the enviropig, looked at the nutritional content. They're identical to a normal Yorkshire pig. LARISA RUDENKO, FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION: What I can tell the American public is that no food from a genetically-engineered animal will go on the market unless the FDA has demonstrated that it's safe. CHERNOFF: But the original idea was not to create a bigger, tastier pig. Why create a pig like this? MOCCIA: To try to control and reduce the environmental footprint of pig farming around the world by reducing the amount of phosphorous that the pig produces. CHERNOFF: Phosphorous is a nutrient that helps the pigs grow, but that they can't fully digest. So, much of it comes out in their manure. Farmers use that manure as fertilizer. When it rains, some of the manure runs off into the watershed, meaning plenty of phosphorous gets into our rivers and lakes. The enviropig's genetic additions allow it to digest more phosphorous. About 50 percent more, according to researchers. That means half as much in its manure, and that's why it's called enviropig. But the head of the Center for Food Safety, an organization promoting organic agriculture, says hog farming needs to change, not the pigs. ANDREW KIMBRELL, CENTER FOR FOOD SAFETY: It's a completely novel cell invasion technology where we are crossing the boundaries of nature as no other generation has before. (END VIDEO) Blog Report .

Wesley says ""students could interact with people face-to-face instead of over phones or computers. Why don't we do that,"" he asks.

"(CNN)  -- Thor Hushovd won a bunch sprint from a whittled down leading peloton to claim the blue riband men's road race title at the world championships in Australia on Sunday. Hushovd is the first Norwegian to win the coveted crown as he relegated Denmark's Matti Breschel and home hope Allan Davis to the minor podium positions after 262.7 kilometers of racing around Melbourne. Breschel now has a silver to add to his bronze of 2008 while Davis could not quite emulate the feat of compatriot Cadel Evans who was defending his title in front of home crowds. Hushovd, a former green jersey winner at the Tour de France and one-day classics expert, timed his charge for the line perfectly. ""It's hard to understand I've won the worlds. It's a dream, it's unreal,"" he told AFP. ""This has to be the best moment of my career."" The race started and finished in two different locations with the last of 11 laps bringing the riders to the suburb of Geelong. Belgian Philippe Gilbert made his bid for victory on the final 15.9 km circuit and looked set to stay clear until being caught near the end by a small group of chasers, including Evans who rode brilliantly in his title defense. But in turn they were reeled in by the bunch, in which Hushovd and his teammate Edvald Boasson Hagen played their full part in bringing it back. A number of leading favorites had fallen by the wayside before the final lap, including world time trial champion Fabian Cancellara of Switzerland and Britain's sprint ace Mark Cavendish. It was the final race of a championship which have been overshadowed by the news of positive drugs tests for Tour de France champion Alberto Contador and a number of other star riders, who were not riding in Australia. Contador has been provisionally suspended by the International Cycling Union (UCI) after his positive test for traces of clenbuterol was revealed Friday. He insists he is innocent and told Spanish television on Saturday night that he was ""very optimistic"" that he will be cleared.","Norway's Thor Hushovd wins men's world road race title in Melbourne .

"Salt Lake City, Utah (CNN) -- Elizabeth Smart has long been silent about the details of an ordeal that began in June 2002 when a stranger crept into her bedroom, held a knife to her throat, marched her up a hillside trail and made her his sex slave. She has spoken to local groups about how to move on after a traumatic experience, celebrated the passage of a national Amber Alert law for missing and abducted children, and offered advice to another alleged kidnapping victim, Jaycee Dugard. In October 2009, Smart drew a general outline of her experience at a hearing to determine whether her accused captor, Brian David Mitchell, 57, was mentally competent to stand trial. Much of her testimony focused on Mitchell's ability to manipulate people and talk his way out of a jam. At that hearing, Smart described being forced to sleep face down in her own vomit after Mitchell gave her too much alcohol, daily rapes and being drugged, shown pornography and threatened with death -- a mere outline of the events that transformed her from a 14-year-old who prayed with her family and read to her little sister into a submissive captive bent on survival. A prosecutor provided a sneak preview of Smart's story in his opening statement Thursday, saying Smart ""was threatened, sexually abused, degraded and humiliated."" He acknowledged the story he was telling was ""disturbing."" It is even more troubling to hear, he said, in Smart's own words. Smart had been scheduled to appear as the prosecution's third witness, following her mother, Lois, and sister, Mary Katherine. She had returned to Utah from France where she was on a mission, a rite of passage typically undertaken by young men raised in the Mormon faith, although it is gaining in popularity among young women. Had things gone as planned, she likely would have been on the witness stand Friday. But a defense challenge over the location of the trial won the attention of a federal appeals court, which halted the trial on Thursday. Assistant U.S. Attorney Felice Viti had finished his opening statement Thursday, and defense attorney Parker Douglas was just warming up, when the proceedings were halted -- before Douglas could complete his 11th sentence, according to the official trial transcript. The three-judge panel vacated its temporary stay Friday. The trial is scheduled to resume Monday. But Viti's preview lent a glimpse of what is to come. Smart was abducted before dawn on June 5, 2002, the prosecutor said, and led to a campsite that ""was her prison for the next four months."" She was stripped, dressed in a robe and brought into a tent for an impromptu ""wedding."" And then, the prosecutor said, she was raped. Smart was in tears when she fell asleep. A cable was attached to her ankle, and she was kept tethered to another cable strung between two trees. She had a bucket for a toilet, Viti told the jury. The cable was removed after six weeks, but she certainly was not ""free,"" the prosecutor added. Rape was a daily occurrence, and she was forced to walk around the camp naked. It went against everything she¹d been taught by her family, everything she believed, he said. During this time, the prosecutor added, Smart devised her survival strategy. She would not resist Mitchell, and she would not antagonize him. She'd go along with him, vowing to ""outlive"" him. And she'd wait for her opportunity to escape. There was a heartbreaking near-miss at the Salt Lake City public library. A homicide detective asked Mitchell to raise the veil Smart wore when they were out in public. Mitchell objected on religious grounds, saying showing her face in public would be inappropriate. The detective didn't challenge him further. Still, Mitchell was rattled enough to suggest a move out of state, Viti said. Along with Mitchell's wife, Wanda Barzee, they traveled to California, winding up at a homeless encampment near Riverside. There, the abuse continued, Viti said. ""She was sexually abused, degraded, humiliated, forced to view pornography and subjected to daily harangues, never allowed to speak, never left alone,"" Viti said. He added that Mitchell made other attempts to ""strip Elizabeth of her identity,"" to break down her sense of herself. He named her ""Shirdashi,"" then let her choose the name ""Esther"" for herself. As they traveled, her name changed again, to ""Augustine Mitchell."" Finally, as they headed back to Utah in March 2003, Smart suggested they hitchhike. She also urged that they leave the robes and veils behind because it would be easier to find a ride in ""regular clothes."" Shortly after arriving back in Utah, they were spotted walking on the street in Sandy, a suburb of Salt Lake City. Viti appeared to anticipate questions from jurors similar to those that have been raised over the past seven years: Why didn't she fight? Why didn't she run? Was she a willing captive? Or was it a case of Stockholm Syndrome, in which kidnapping victims come to identify with their captors? ""Nothing she did was voluntary,"" the prosecutor told the jury. ""Everything she did was to survive. ... It worked. She survived.""","NEW: The appeals court lifts the stay, denying the defense request for a mistrial .

"London, England (CNN) -- Theirs was a royal love affair immortalized in diamonds and gold. Now, more than 70 years after England's King Edward abdicated the throne to marry Wallis Simpson, some of the couple's jewels are coming up for sale. Sotheby's announced plans to auction 20 items that were owned by the couple in London in November. The items include 11 pieces by Cartier, some of which are estimated at more than 1 million pounds ($1.5 million) each. ""The offering comprises not only incomparable examples of the genius of Cartier in collaboration with the Windsors, but also pieces whose inscriptions tell the story of perhaps the greatest love story of the 20th century, the romance that led Edward VIII to abdicate the throne of Great Britain,"" said David Bennett, the chairman of Sotheby's Jewelry in Europe and the Middle East. The couple commissioned jewels from the great European jewelry houses during their courtship in the 1930s and after they were married, Sotheby's said. Cartier was one of their favored jewelers, and the company's high jewelry director Jeanne Toussaint created some of her best work just for the couple, who came to be known as the Duke and Duchess of Windsor. One of the pieces she created was an onyx and diamond bracelet in the form of an elongated panther. Designed in 1952, the bracelet was among the finest of Toussaint's ""great cats"" jewels and is in the sale at an estimated 1-1.5 million pounds. Also up for sale is a diamond flamingo brooch with feathers of rubies, sapphires and emeralds, and a beak of citrine. The brooch, also estimated between 1 and 1.5 million pounds, was the showpiece of an earlier sale of the couple's jewels, held in Geneva in 1987. All the items up for auction in November belonged to a single owner, but Sotheby's did not disclose their identity. Edward had been on the throne for just 11 months when he decided to give up the crown in December 1936 to marry Simpson, an American divorcee. He chose to abdicate because, as supreme governor of the Church of England, he was not permitted to marry a divorced woman. The abdication speech he gave Dec. 11, 1936, revealed his love for the woman who would later become his wife. ""I have found it impossible to carry the heavy burden of responsibility and to discharge my duties as king, as I would wish to do, without the help and support of the woman I love,"" Edward said. The auction includes a favorite bracelet of Simpson's, made of diamonds and supporting nine gem-set Latin crosses -- each with an intimate inscription on the back, Sotheby's said. The crosses represent special moments in her life, including her marriage and the assassination attempt against the king. A heart-shaped brooch of rubies and diamonds was commissioned for the couple's 20th wedding anniversary and features the initials W.E. -- for Wallis and Edward -- in emeralds on the front. Cartier also created a six-piece diamond-encrusted dress suite in 1935, with inscriptions on the back. One piece is a gift Simpson gave to her husband -- an 18-carat gold and gem-set cigarette case, engraved with a map of Europe. It shows the routes of trips they had taken together and has gems marking meaningful locations. The inscription reveals it was a Christmas present in 1935. Other items in the sale include a purse made by Van Cleef and Arpels of gold mesh, rubies, turquoise and diamonds, and a series of silver items and medals once owned by Edward.","Sotheby's announces plans to auction 20 items that were owned by the couple .

"(CNN) -- French champions Marseille have moved quickly to boost their forward options by winning the race to sign highly-rated striker Loic Remy from Nice. The 23-year-old had been one of the most sought-after players in Europe after scoring 26 goals in 68 games in the past two Ligue 1 seasons. The former Lyon player passed a medical on Thursday and joined Marseille, who have lost the first two league matches of this season, for a fee of about $19 million. Marseille coach Didier Deschamps turned to him as a replacement for Senegal star Mamadou Niang, who joined Turkish side Fenerbahce this week, after being put off by the price of Sevilla's Brazilian World Cup star Luis Fabiano. Ivory Coast striker Bakari Kone and former Spain forward Fernando Morientes have also left l'OM since last season. ""In as far as the expectations of the public are concerned, I'd hoped to bring in a striker of international caliber like Fabiano,"" Deschamps said in quotes carried by the UK Press Association. ""But when I was told about the figures being spoken about I cannot ask the club to buy whatever the cost. I don't have the right to ask that. If the price is not reasonable, then stop."" Remy, who has signed a five-year contract after being courted by English clubs such as Stoke and West Ham, said that Marseille's involvement in the UEFA Champions League was a key factor. ""It's something I was looking for. After that, we know very well that many players want to play for OM. It is not given to everyone. When Jose Anigo came to offer me a contract, I took the time to think but have had no hesitation,"" he told club's website. Marseille had also been linked with another France international striker Andre-Pierre Gignac, but his club issued a statement on Wednesday denying having received an offer for the striker. Spanish club Sevilla have told English side Arsenal to improve their offer for France international defender Sebastien Squillaci. The 30-year-old center-back was left out of Wednesday night's defeat by Braga as he did not want to become cup-tied in the Champions League. Arsenal need cover with Mikael Silvestre, William Gallas, Sol Campbell and Philippe Senderos having left, with only young Frenchman Laurent Koscielny coming in. Croatia striker Nikica Jelavic is poised to join Scottish champions Rangers after refusing to play in Rapid Vienna's Europa League qualifier against Aston Villa on Thursday night, which ended in a 1-1 draw. Rangers agreed a $6 million fee with the Austria side and the 24-year-old, who will undergo a medical on Friday. Slovakia's young World Cup star Vladimir Weiss will also move to Glasgow after agreeing a season-long loan from big-spending club Manchester City, having been a target for Scottish rivals Celtic, Germany's Stuttgart and Italian side Sampdoria. The 20-year-old winger spent the second half of last season with English club Bolton before helping Slovakia reach the second round in South Africa. English club Liverpool left Argentina international Javier Mascherano out of the team for Thursday's 1-0 home win Trabzonspor in the Europa League, despite manager Roy Hodgson earlier insisting the wantaway midfielder would not leave unless an acceptable offer is received. Mascherano, 26, has two years left on his contract but a much-hyped reunion with former Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez at Inter Milan has yet to eventuate. In other Europa League ties, Russian runners-up Sibir Novosibirsk beat 21-time Dutch champions PSV Eindhoven 1-0 and former Germany captain Michael Ballack scored a late penalty in Bayer Leverkusen's 3-0 win over Ukraine's Tavriya Simferopol. Manchester City won 1-0 away to Romania's Timisoara thanks to a debut goal from Italy striker Mario Balotelli. Turkish club Fenerbahce lost 1-0 PAOK Saloniki, having already been knocked out of the Champions League, while fellow Istanbul giants Galatasaray were held 2-2 at home by Karpaty Lviv of Ukraine. Stuttgart won 1-0 away to Slovenia's Slovan Bratislava, while fellow German club Borussia Dortmund crushed Azerbaijan's FK Karabakh with two goals by Paraguay World Cup striker Lucas Barrios and Japanese forward Shinji Kagawa -- all coming in the first half. Celtic won 2-0 at home to Dutch side Utrecht, while Portugal's Porto won 3-0 away to 10-man Racing Genk of Belgium. Danish side Brondy won 2-0 away to Sporting Lisbon in the Portuguese capital, while Italian giants Juventus won 2-1 away to Austria's Sturm Graz thanks to Amauri's late goal.","Young France international striker Loic Remy joins French champions Marseille .

"(CNN) -- English champions Chelsea scored six goals for the second successive match of the new Premier League season at home to Wigan Athletic to match Arsenal's effort earlier on Saturday. Nicolas Anelka and substitute Salomon Kalou scored twice each for the London side, while Florent Malouda and Yossi Benayoun also netted as Chelsea again set the mark for Manchester United to follow ahead of last season's runners-up's trip to Fulham on Sunday. It was the second successive heavy defeat for Wigan manager Roberto Martinez, leaving the Spaniard an early favorite to be the first casualty of the season. Wigan beat Chelsea near the start of last season, but suffered an 8-0 thrashing on the final day of the campaign in April and have now shipped 25 goals in five league matches. France winger Malouda broke the deadlock from close range in the 33rd minute after Frank Lampard's effort was saved by Chris Kirkland, then Anelka scored twice in four minutes after halftime -- the second a header set up by last weekend's hat-trick hero Didier Drogba. Drogba nets hat-trick as Chelsea crush West Brom . James McCarthy hit the post for Wigan, who had an effort by Mauro Boselli ruled out for offside before Malouda's replacement Kalou made it 4-0 in the 78th minute. Wigan's French Mohamed Diame was carried off with an injury, then Ivory Coast forward Kalou netted another goal with a minute to play and Israeli substitute Benayoun scored his first since joining from Liverpool in time added on. Young England winger Theo Walcott netted a hat-trick as Arsenal brought promoted Blackpool back to earth with a 6-0 crushing in north London. Blackpool had thrashed Wigan 4-0 away in the small club's historic first Premier League outing, but were outclassed to end a difficult week following the resignation of chairman Karl Oyston amid reports he may be made bankrupt. Walcott put Arsenal ahead in the 13th minute, and the match was effectively ended just after half an hour when visiting defender Ian Evatt was sent off for fouling Marouane Chamakh on the edge of the area. English Premier League preview . Andrei Arshavin scored the resulting penalty, Walcott made it 3-0 six minutes before halftime and Abou Diaby scored the fourth four minutes after the break. The midfielder set up Walcott's hat-trick goal on 58 and Morocco striker Chamakh made up for a series of misses as he scored his first for Arsenal to seal the romp with eight minutes left. Tottenham bounced back from the 3-2 Champions League defeat by Young Boys with a controversial 2-1 win at Stoke, despite missing several injured players. Stoke suffered a second successive defeat as debutant striker Jon Walters' late effort was ruled out despite appearing to have crossed the goal line. Gareth Bale scored both goals for the London team, the first coming in the 20th minute after his shot was saved and then Stoke defender Ryan Shawcross blocked Peter Crouch's headed rebound into his path. Striker Ricardo Fuller leveled five minutes later but attacking full-back Bale made it 2-1 on the half-hour with a superb volley. Stoke suffered a double blow, with Malian striker Mamady Sidibe possibly ruled out for the rest of the season after snapping his Achilles tendon late in the match. West Ham also fell to a second defeat under new manager Avram Grant, losing 3-1 at home to Bolton as striker Carlton Cole missed a penalty and fellow England international Matthew Upson scored an own-goal. Jussi Jaaskelainen saved striker Cole's weak 33rd-minute spot-kick before defender Upson headed into his own net three minutes after halftime, then Sweden striker Johan Elmander netted twice either side of Mark Noble's penalty consolation for West Ham (79). Birmingham also missed a penalty but bounced back to beat Blackburn 2-1 with both goals from Craig Gardner after Steven Nzonzi gave the visitors the lead. Ben Foster denied Morten Gamst Pedersen five minutes after halftime following Nikola Zigic's foul on Christopher Samba, then French midfielder Nzonzi headed in a corner. But James McFadden set up Gardner's first on 57 and the midfielder smashed a spectacular winner from long range with 19 minutes to play to leave both teams with three points from two outings this season. West Brom bounced back from last Saturday's thrashing by beating Sunderland 1-0 thanks to a late winner from new signing Peter Odemwingie, with the Nigeria striker netting in the 81st minute just a day after sealing his move from Russian club Lokomotiv Moscow. Wolverhampton followed up their opening win with a 1-1 draw at Everton as striker Sylvan Ebanks-Blake's 75th-minute goal canceled out the opener by Australia midfielder Tim Cahill just before halftime. In Sunday's other game, promoted Newcastle host Aston Villa, while on Monday Liverpool travel to Manchester City.","Chelsea thrash Wigan in late match for a second successive 6-0 victory in new season .

"Washington (CNN)  -- The Toyota Motor Corp. has indicated to the U.S. government it will pay a $16.4 million fine -- the largest ever against an automaker -- for failing to notify the Department of Transportation of a ""sticky pedal"" defect in its cars for at least four months, according to a senior Transportation Department official. The company has told the government it will sign legal documents Monday agreeing to pay the maximum civil penalty of $16.375 million, according to the official, who was not authorized to speak for attribution because the agreement has not been announced. Toyota would then have 30 days to pay the fine. This official added that an agreement does not release Toyota from any potential criminal liability or civil liability related to the sticky-pedal defect. The Transportation Department's National Highway Traffic Safety Administration sought the fine after it learned, through documents obtained from Toyota, that the automaker knew of sticky gas pedal problems since at least September last year, the agency said this month. Under federal regulations, automakers are required to inform the agency within five days of determining that a safety defect exists in one of its products. ""By paying the full civil penalty, Toyota is accepting responsibility for hiding this safety defect from NHTSA in violation of the law"" the senior DOT official said Sunday. Toyota cars and trucks have been the subject of at least three separate major recalls in the past year. One was for the ""sticky pedal"" situation in which gas pedals, as they age, begin to stick in a partially depressed position. Another was for gas pedals that can stick on some floor mats, and a third was for braking problems on Toyota Prius hybrid cars. The largest fine levied to date by the government on an automaker was nearly $1 million taken from General Motors in 2004 for failing to deal promptly with a windshield-wiper issue, an amount that was negotiated down from the $3 million originally sought by NHTSA.","U.S. official: Toyota indicates it will pay a $16.4 million fine .

"(CNN) -- A 12-year-old male killer whale, who showed signs of being ill only the day before, died Tuesday afternoon at SeaWorld in San Diego, California, the park announced. The cause of death for Sumar won't be known until a necropsy is complete, SeaWorld said. Results may not be known for several weeks. ""It's a very sad day,"" spokesman Dave Koontz told CNN. ""He was a great young killer whale. He was sharp."" Sumar, who weighed about 5,000 pounds, had been at SeaWorld San Diego since 2001, coming from an Ohio park. He was one of seven killer whales at SeaWorld and was able to exhibit about 100 ""behaviors,"" Koontz said. The killer whale had no medical history or problems with behavior, the spokesman said, adding that there was no evidence of communicable disease. ""He had a great disposition."" ""Trainers had noticed that Sumar was acting lethargic yesterday (Monday) afternoon. Park veterinarians began a regimen of antibiotics to help try to stabilize his condition while they attempted to determine the cause of his illness,"" a SeaWorld statement said. ""His condition worsened today and a decision was made to cancel the 12:30 p.m. Shamu show, so that trainers and veterinarians could continue to devote their full attention to Sumar. Despite these efforts, Sumar did not survive."" Sumar's trainers and support staff were devastated by the sudden loss and are sharing stories, Koontz said. ""The loss of any animal is difficult, but that was even more so."" Orlando, Florida-based SeaWorld was recently fined $75,000 by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration for three safety violations, including one classified as willful, after an animal trainer was killed by a whale in Orlando in February. SeaWorld, which also has a location in San Antonio, Texas, said it would contest the violations. The last killer whale to die at the San Diego venue was Splash, who was sickly when SeaWorld adopted him. He was nursed back to health and lived 15 years until 2005. No public memorial for Sumar is planned, although fans will be able to comment on the park's Facebook page, Koontz said. SeaWorld said its shows would resume on schedule Wednesday.","Killer whale dies at SeaWorld in San Diego, California .

"Hickory, North Carolina (CNN) -- The stepmother of a missing 10-year-old girl in North Carolina said during a jailhouse visit with two relatives this week that she blames a lot of her current predicament on her husband, one of those relatives said Friday. The relative, one of two cousins who visited Monday with Elisa Baker in jail, said she was speaking publicly after a few family members met and ""decided that we needed to share a few things that we do know."" Elisa Baker's stepdaughter, Zahra Baker, was reported missing last month. ""As we talked with her, she cried over missing Zahra and how her husband has left her to take all the blame for what has happened when he played a big part in this terrible situation,"" the cousin said in an exclusive interview with HLN's ""Nancy Grace"" producer Natisha Lance. The cousin spoke on condition of anonymity because of death threats the family has received. Later, the cousin said Elisa Baker believed it was unfair that she was jailed ""for something that he had done,"" referring to husband Adam Troy Baker, Zahra's father. The cousin said she hoped that Zahra's body will be found soon, ""since she is believed to be deceased and that all of the truth will come out."" The cousin said she and her sister visited Elisa in jail on Monday after more than two years during which they had not spoken. The woman added that she had received three letters from Elisa, ""and in each one of them she made it very clear how much she cared about Zahra and that she don't understand the man that she loves can be this, can do her this way."" The woman said she did not know what happened to the freckle-faced girl who lost her leg to bone cancer at age 5 and reportedly developed lung cancer a few years later. Police launched a search for Zahra on October 9, but no one other than a family member had reported seeing her since September 25, when a woman saw her at a furniture store. Police on Monday confirmed that a prosthetic leg discovered last week in brush off a North Carolina road belongs to Zahra Baker, whose disappearance is now being probed as a homicide. Police said Elisa Baker admitted that she planted a fake ransom note the day after the girl's disappearance was reported. Initially arrested on October 10 on charges unrelated to Zahra's disappearance, including writing worthless checks, Elisa Baker was additionally charged with obstruction of justice for leaving the note. That charge is a felony. She is now cooperating with investigators, Hickory police have said. Zahra's father was arrested late last month in nearby Catawba County on eight charges, including five counts of submitting worthless checks and three counts of failing to appear in court. Police earlier acknowledged that Adam Baker faced bad-check charges unrelated to the disappearance of his daughter. But they did not initially arrest him, as he had been helping authorities in their search. ""Adam Baker has a lot of the answers,"" Elisa Baker's cousin said Friday. ""What we do know about him is that he doesn't believe in God. He is very into paganism. He's ridin' around with a sign on his window that says Zahra was abused by her stepmother. If this is true, then why didn't he, the biological father, put a stop to it and protect his little girl? ""Why didn't he beg the public for someone to bring his daughter home? Why has he not personally searched for Zahra? How could a loving father begin his 911 call with, 'Hello, how are you doing?' He needs to answer these questions."" Adam Baker's attorney has not returned repeated phone calls from CNN requesting comment on the investigation. During their discussion, the woman said her cousin told her that Zahra's cancer had been in remission, but that she was sick for the two weeks ""before whatever's happened happened ... she did not completely come out and tell me what has actually happened."" The woman said that Elisa Baker ""cared for that little girl deeply"" and had taken a polygraph. Scott Riley, Elisa Baker's attorney, declined to comment Friday when asked about the polygraph. Asked why none of Elisa Baker's relatives had bailed her out of jail, the woman said, ""I guess probably they're waiting for evidence or to find out what has really happened."" Asked if the family is divided about what may have happened, she said, ""A little bit right now, yes."" Asked what she thinks happened to the girl, the woman said, ""I absolutely have no clue. All of it is just so confusing and, until we get the facts, I'm not going to know what to think.""

"United Nations (CNN) -- Rwanda will not pull its troops from U.N. peacekeeping missions despite a leaked draft report that accused Rwandan soldiers of genocide in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Rwandan President Paul Kagame told the U.N. secretary-general Sunday. Ban Ki-moon said that he and Kagame spoke about the Democratic Republic of the Congo Mapping Report, which is to be released in October. Kagame complained to Ban about the leaks from the report, which alleges that the Rwandan military and an allied rebel group massacred ethnic Hutus in Congo between 1993 and 2003. The president put his troops on alert for a possible departure from Darfur, the troubled region of Sudan where a Rwandan general leads the U.N.-African Union peacekeeping mission. ""Tens of thousands of Hutu civilians were slaughtered with knives, bludgeoned with hammers and burned alive as the Rwandan army and the Allied Democratic Liberation Forces swept across Congo -- then called Zaire -- leading to the toppling of dictator Mobutu Sese Seko,"" the draft report says. Kagame, who called the allegations ""fraudulent"" and ""absurd,"" and Ban met in Kigali, Rwanda, earlier this month to discuss the report, agreeing to meet later on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting. The United Nations said that Ban ""was very satisfied"" after Sunday's meeting ""to learn that Rwanda would continue its important role in U.N. peacekeeping operations, and particularly in the strife-torn western Sudanese region of Darfur."" The United Nations delayed release of the report by 30 days and agreed to allow nations named in it to add comments before publication. Kagame first took power on 1994 after the genocide of 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. In the 100-day genocide, militias made up of ethnic Hutus slaughtered ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus nationwide. The killing ended when Tutsi-led militias backing Kagame ousted the Hutu government supporting the massacre.","Kagame was angry over U.N. report that accuses Rwandan troops of genocide .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Gary McKinnon, the hacker who broke into Pentagon and NASA computers, was at risk of suicide Friday after losing an effort to fight extradition to the United States, his attorney said. Gary McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, fears for her son's life after the Supreme Court decision. ""This is the wholesale destruction and bullying of a small individual by the United States and now our own government,"" attorney Karen Todner said in a statement. McKinnon's mother Janis Sharp described her son as ""suicidal."" The British government did not respond. McKinnon, a British citizen, has admitted breaking the law and intentionally gaining unauthorized access to U.S. government computers. The U.S. government says McKinnon carried out the biggest military computer hacking of all time, accessing 97 computers from his home in London for a year starting in March 2001, and costing the government about $1 million. U.S. authorities want him extradited to face trial in the United States. McKinnon, currently free on bail in England, has said he was simply doing research to find out whether the U.S. government was covering up the existence of UFOs. McKinnon bases his case partly on the fact that he has Asperger's syndrome, a type of autism. He had hoped to bring his case before the nation's newly-formed Supreme Court. But the court rejected the request Friday. McKinnon has one effort left -- to appeal to the home secretary. ""The effect on Gary of these proceedings and impending extradition has been, and is, devastating,"" Todner's statement said. ""He is a highly vulnerable man in a very fragile state and this is a huge blow to him and his family."" McKinnon is thought to have acted alone, with no known connection to any terrorist organization, said Paul McNulty, the former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia. A U.S. federal grand jury indicted McKinnon on seven counts of computer fraud and related activity. If convicted, he would face a maximum of 10 years in prison on each count and a $250,000 fine. McKinnon has said it was easy for him to access the secret files.","Gary McKinnon's mother, Janis Sharp, described her son as ""suicidal""

"(CNN) -- Qantas, Australia's national airline, grounded its Airbus A380 fleet indefinitely after one of its planes suffered a midair engine failure on Thursday. The airline said flights of the twin-deck planes -- the world's largest airliners -- will remain suspended until an investigation into Thursday's incident is complete. ""As long as it takes,"" said airline CEO Alan Joyce, when a reporter asked how long the suspension would last. ""We are being very cautious until we know exactly what caused this."" One of the four engines on a Qantas airliner shut down six minutes after takeoff Thursday from Singapore's Changi Airport, Joyce said. The plane -- with 440 passengers and 26 crew members -- was headed to Sydney, Australia, but it returned to Changi. While in the air above the western Indonesian island of Batam, part of the engine's covering, or cowling, tore off. ""I am not sure what actually happened with the debris and why parts of the engine left the aircraft and fell into the ground,"" Joyce said. ""We're still looking at what exactly was the cause of that."" The pilot made an announcement updating passengers during the flight. ""I do apologize,"" the pilot said. ""I'm sure you are aware we have a technical issue with our number two engine. We have dealt with the situation, the aircraft is secure at this stage. We're going to have to hold for some time whilst we do lighten our load by dumping some fuel and a number of checklist [items] we have to perform. ""I'm sure you are aware we are not proceeding to Sydney at this stage. We're making a left turn now to track back toward Singapore and as we progress with this we'll keep you informed, but at this stage everything is secure, the aircraft is flying safely and we'll get back to you very shortly with further information. Thank you for your patience."" Local television stations in Indonesia showed debris parts with red-white markings. Pictures of the Airbus A380 after it landed showed the cowling torn off in the back half. Trifuadi, a security officer at an engineering firm in Batam, said he heard a loud explosion and saw smoke coming out of the engine of a plane flying overhead. Shortly afterward, debris fell from the plane to the ground, said Trifuadi who, like many Indonesians, goes by one name. The flight -- QF32 -- landed in Singapore safely, without injury to passenger or crew. Passenger Meg Graham said she heard a loud bang within minutes of the plane taking off. ""And then another bang,"" she said. Ulf Waschbusch, who said he was on his way to Australia for the first time, said the crew kept passengers apprised of what was happening. ""We all stayed pretty calm,"" he told CNN. ""It was an almost eerie calm."" The airline said it will work with the plane's manufacturer as well as Rolls-Royce, the maker of the engine, to determine what went wrong. A spokesman for the Rolls-Royce told CNN that ""safety is always our highest priority. We are currently analyzing the available information and working with our customers to support their operations."" Qantas now has six A380s in its fleet of 191 planes. Airbus will at some point deliver another 14, the airline said. Singapore Airlines announced Thursday that it has temporarily halted flights of its 11 Airbus A380s to do precautionary checks in light of the Qantas incident. Lufthansa, which operates three Airbus A380s, told CNN it is planning to carry out additional precautionary checks on the engines of the planes. The airline is waiting for more detail from Rolls-Royce about the specific checks that need to be carried out before they proceed. CNN's Christabelle Fombu, Nicky Robertson, Judy Kwon, Kevin Voigt, Liz Neisloss, Ayesha Durgahee and Mia Anngre contributed to this report .","A passenger says she heard a loud bang, then another .
