"Stilyan Petrov is back with a ball at his feet and a smile on his face after returning to the pitch as he continues his recovery from leukemia. Petrov has been turning out for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s in Sunday League and the Celtic and Aston Villa legend, who was diagnosed with the disease in 2012, is happy to be doing what he does best. He said: 'It's a good laugh and they're competitive games. It's just really nice to be out there playing a proper game. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Inspirational  Villa hero Stiliyan Petrov playing football again . Stiliyan Petrov looked happy to be back in action playing for Wychall Wanderers Over 35s . 'I've played 90 minutes and my fitness is improving but I need to be patient.' Petrov, 35, has played three times for the team managed by former Coventry defender Dave Busst, who suffered a career-ending injury in 1996, and has scored once in a 5-3 cup win. 'Maybe Sky Sports will show it,' Petrov joked. 'As far as positions go, you have to go where you're needed. Sometimes only 12 players are there. 'The one game, we were winning 2-0 and they had a different man marking me every 10 minutes.' The former Celtic and Aston Villa star has played three times for the men from Shirley in the Midlands . Petrov wears the No 10 shirt and has certainly made his mark in the Central Wawrickshire League Premier One Division with his side losing just one of their last three. Tythe Barn Lane in Shirely is a world away from Parkhead or Villa Park but he's never short of memories. 'I meet a lot of Villa fans and it's great to chat to them, said the man capped 106 times by the Bulgarian national team and who wore the captain's armband representing his country. Petrov, whose leukemia is in remission, wasn't afraid to get stuck in on his return to football . Petrov admitted he is loving being back in the thick of things on the pitch with Wychall Wanderers .

With the disease in remission, Petrov added: 'Everything is fine, touch wood. There are only three months to go on tablets and I'm finished. I'm on steroids until January. 'I'll be there again on Sunday but don't ask me who we're playing.' Wanderers' secretary John Busst - Dave's dad - paid a glowing tribute to Petrov. 'The most amazing thing is that he's such a lovely, down-to-earth chap. He comes along, pays his subs and has a drink with the lads. 'He is amazing. Players of that class, such is their footballing brain, they are three or four moves ahead even if they are only 40 or 50 per cent fit. 'He scored, and it was a good goal. On Sunday, we won our first league game 2-1 and he made both goals.' Petrov officially announced his retirement from the professional game in May 2013 and had a short spell working as a coach with the Villa Under 21 team. Petrov did a lap of honour at the end of the 2012-13 season at Villa Park and also had a charity match last year at Celtic Park with a host of stars, including Hoops legend Henrik Larsson, turning out in support .

"Ian Poulter missed a short putt at the last as he fell short in his bid to win a first title in two years at the Turkish Airlines Open. The 38-year-old had a 6ft putt to force a play-off with America’s Brooks Koepka, but pulled it left of the target. While Poulter will be forced to reflect on a third-round 75 that wrecked a good week, Rory McIlroy now only needs to turn up at the season’s finale next week to claim the Race to Dubai. VIDEO Scroll down to see the moment Brooks Koepka won the Turkish Open . Ian Poulter came up short in his bid to end a two-year wait for a title at the Turkish Airlines Open . The Englishman blamed a 'c**p third round' for his ultimate failure in Antalya . American Brooks Koepa holds the trophy after Poulter failed to take the event into a play-off . There was an outside chance of the absent Northern Irishman being usurped at the top of the Order of Merit, but the failure of Marcel Siem, Jamie Donaldson or Sergio Garcia to win here means McIlroy’s second Race title in three years is mathematically assured. None of which will be a consolation to Poulter, his Ryder Cup team-mate. Poulter got off to a blistering start to the tournament and opened a six-shot lead with rounds of 64 and 66 at the end of a poor season. But he was brutal in assessment of a ‘c**p’ third round and could not quite match Koepka’s fast finish, despite shooting a 67. Koepka had appeared to wobble in the finish two holes, first with an iron into deep rough next to the 17th green and then by driving into trees at the last. But each time he recovered for par and a seven-under round of 65, meaning Poulter needed to birdie the par five 18th to force a play-off. Siem went into the final round as McIlroy's only realistic challenger in the Race to Dubai but after finishing on 12 under revealed he dislocated a rib while stretching before his final-round 71. Rory McIlroy, holding the 2014 Player of the trophy, has sealed a second Race to Dubai win . McIlroy's 'best ever year' include victories at The Open (above), US PGA Championship and the Ryder Cup . He said: 'I went in the gym this morning at 7am and warmed up, and then we did a bit of stretching - something I haven't done for a year now because of my surgeries. I couldn't really do it, and dislocated my rib. I thought I can't even tee it up. 'Then my physio tried to crack it back in, didn't work and we went so see the chiropractor and they pushed it back in. I had like 1,600 milligrams of Ibuprofen. I couldn't have a proper back swing.' McIlroy, who won two majors in 2014, said: 'This has obviously been the best season of my career by a long way, and to win The Race to Dubai for the second time really is something truly special. That four-week spell over the summer, from The Open to the US PGA Championship, would have to be the best golf of my life, so I feel like I’ve really earned The Race to Dubai. 'Winning it for the first time two years ago was a fantastic feeling, but I feel like I’m now a more complete player and my all-round game has moved to another level. I’ve put in a lot of hard work this season, with my game and my fitness, so it’s nice to get the rewards at the end of it. Marcel Siem's chance of challenging McIlroy in the Race to Dubai was effectively ended by a dislocated rib . Poulter heads to Dubai without any pressure and hoping to end his season on a high . 'In some ways the pressure is off next week, but I’ll fight very hard to end the year on a high with another victory. I’ve a great record in this tournament, and in Dubai generally, having secured my first European Tour win there in 2009.' Poulter said: 'It's a disappointing outcome. I think hats off to a great final round, and obviously he (Koepka) has played some superb golf there. The damage was done on Saturday. That, for me, is really disappointing; to have played three great rounds of golf, and just one blip on Saturday, is a real shame. 'So you know, it's frustrating. It is what it is. There's no other word for it. Yes, I'm going to be angry. I'll be angry for a good few days. But that's fine. I'll keep myself in my own little room and have a little chat with myself and come out and win next week.'","Ian Poulter missed a short putt to force a play-off at Turkish Airlines Open .

Irishman also slams Fergie for Rock of Gibraltar dispute . Everyone who was at the Riverside Stadium on October 29 2005 remembers the game. Middlesbrough beat Manchester United 4-1 and it appeared – wrongly as it turned out – that years of dominance for Sir Alex Ferguson’s team were about to come to an end. Roy Keane certainly feared as much and his frustration spilled over when he was subsequently asked – instructed, he claims in his new book – to appear on the club’s in-house TV channel MUTV to talk about a game in which he had not played. What happened next is embedded in United’s folklore. Keane’s words were considered so volatile that the programme was never shown and the Old Trafford captain was fined £5000. Weeks later, he was gone. Alex Ferguson was not impressed with Roy Keane criticising his Manchester United team-mates .

In his book The Second Half, however, Keane claims his criticism of his team mates didn’t upset a single one of them and that it was only manager Sir Alex Ferguson and his assistant manager Carlos Queiroz who had a problem with his actions. Aware of what was appearing in newspapers about the issue, Keane called a meeting in the United dressing room and explained to this team mates that – contrary to press reports he believes were leaked by the club – he had not questioned the amount of money they earned. 'It was getting a bit silly so I got the players together in the dressing room and told them it was f*****g nonsense,” he writes. 'They were all going: ‘Yeah, Yeah’. Not one of them had an issue. Not one. 'Even now people still say: ""The video had to be destroyed"". Like it was a nuclear weapon or something.” Keane said he spoke to his team-mates and none of them had an issue with his criticism .

Keane writes about the MUTV row in his new autobiography The Second Half . Still Keane had another trial to undergo, though, and it is this that he believes sowed the seeds of Ferguson’s decision to get rid of him. Called in to an office at the club’s training ground, Ferguson made his captain and the first team squad sit through the programme in its entirety. Again Keane was convinced the players he had criticised – such as Darren Fletcher, Rio Ferdinand and Kieron Richardson – did not have a problem with him. 'I said to Darren Fletcher: ""Fletch?’” writes Keane. 'I had said something about my wife tackling better than him for one of the goals. 'But I could tell he was fine with it. 'But the manager and Carlos were in the back with steam coming out of their ears. 'The manager said: ""It’s a disgrace, this f*****g video.""' In his book, Keane makes an issue of matters such as trust and loyalty and it clearly rankles to this day that he was made out to be the bad guy after a programme he never wanted to make in the first place. 'The MUTV people go: ""It’s your turn"",' he revealed. 'I had to do it. 'I was disappointed with the players but it was MUTV, propaganda for the club. 'So I did the interview.' Keane believe United painted him as 'loose cannon slagging everyone off'. By midday on November 18, he was no longer a United player.","Roy Keane has lifted the lid on row that ultimately led to him leaving Manchester United in his autobiography 'The Second Half'

Roy Keane says he wouldn’t have made the same mistake as Rio Ferdinand by missing a drugs test. Ferdinand was handed an eight-month ban and fined £50,000 for missing the routine test at the training ground in September 2003. The former Manchester United captain passes the damning verdict in his autobiography The Second Half, which is released on Thursday.

Ferdinand (centre) and Keane (right) along with Ruud van Nistelrooy at the United photo call in 2003 . 'If it had been me, and the doctor had said I had to do a drugs test, I'd have gone and done it. It wasn't something I'd have forgotten. 'It wouldn't have been like collecting a letter at the office, or remembering your boots. 'When a doctor says you've got to do a drugs test, it's not an everyday thing. But then, some people are genuinely forgetful. 'I don't think I was annoyed at the time, and I don't think the other players were either. 'But, ultimately, the team suffered. I didn't look at Rio and think that he'd been up to no good, or that there was a hidden reason for what had occurred. 'I think he genuinely forgot. We paid the price. 'He was a very good player and we missed him, especially in the second half of the season when the crunch games were coming up.' Ferdinand lost an appeal against the ban and missed Euro 2004 for England as a result of his ban before making his return in a 2-1 victory for Manchester United against Liverpool at Old Trafford. Ferdinand, currently playing for Harry Redknapp's QPR, has recently released his autobiography, #2sides, as the 35-year-old reaches the twilight of his career. 'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: ""This is great isn’t it?"". I went: ""I used to play in these games Adrian"". I wasn’t being cocky. 'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: ""Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you"". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: ""I liked your commentary last night"". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!""' 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best. 'Looking at what happened to David Moyes, I can only conclude that he didn’t have a strong dressing room. He had a weak dressing room.'

"London came second in the most congested cities list, with 82 hours of delay a year for motorists . Scroll down for video . Traffic jams are getting worse, with London hold-ups increasing despite the congestion charge, according to new figures. UK drivers wasted a total of 30 hours in traffic congestion in 2013 - one hour more than in 2012 - statistics from traffic information company Inrix showed. The London commute zone had the biggest increase in hours wasted, rising from 72 hours in 2012 to 82 hours last year. Of 25 of the most congested cities in Europe for urban traffic, London was second only to Brussels (83 hours wasted last year). Inrix also listed the worst roads in the UK based on total annual hours of delay in the peak period. The 'winner' was the A4 in the afternoon peak between central London and the junction 3 of the M4 near Heathrow in west London, with 91 annual delay hours. Second in this 'worst road' list, with 73 hours of annual delays, was the M4 going in the opposite direction in the afternoon between the M4 junction 3 and central London. All the top 10 worst roads were in London and all were at their most congested in the afternoons. The Inrix figures also showed that traffic congestion in 2013 was worse than in 2012 in nine of the 18 cities analysed. After the London commute zone, the most congested areas were Greater Manchester, Merseyside, South Nottinghamshire and Greater Birmingham. Of the most congested European cities, Greater Manchester was 12th. All the worst roads were in London, and are worst in the afternoon, with the A4 coming top, the study shows . Overall, the UK was the sixth-worst congested country for traffic in 2013, with Belgium top (58 hours wasted in jams), followed by the Netherlands (44 hours), Germany and France (both 35 hours) and Luxembourg (31 hours). Inrix president and chief executive Bryan Mistele said: 'So goes traffic, so goes the economy. 'While bad news for drivers, the increases in traffic congestion in Europe are signs of a slowly recovering economy.'","London was second only to Brussels on most congested cities list .

"Forty-five students, among them young children, were discovered held in chains in a basement when police raided an Islamic seminary in Pakistan last night. The male students, some said to be as young as 12 but appearing even younger, were found in what amounted to a dungeon at the Madrassa Zakarya in the Sohrab Goth district of Karachi. Led barefoot from their prison, captives told officers they had suffered regular beatings and been hung upside down as a form of punishment. Freed: Young Pakistani students sit a room after being rescued following a police raid on Madrassa Zakarya in Karachi last night . A young student cries after being rescued. Pakistani police found 45 students found chained in the basement during the raid . A young student carries his belongings as he leaves the madrassa after the raid last night . Others said they had been visited by Taliban fighters and that 10 of their fellow students had disappeared in recent months. One boy said that visiting Taliban members had told them to 'prepare for battle'. Some Pakistani madrassas have long been suspected of grooming Islamic militants. Police arrested a cleric and two others at the scene, but the madrassa's administrator managed to escape during the raid, Pakistan's Express Tribune reported. Local police Superintendent Rao Anwar told the paper: 'Those recovered are aged between 12 and 50 years and are mainly of Pakhtun ethnicity. 'A few drug addicts and mentally challenged persons were also among those who were recovered.' 'It seems that the administration was running a sort of religious school-cum-rehabilitation-centre and were receiving considerable sums of money from parents of those kept in for that purpose.' Rescued Pakistani students sit in a police vehicle after the police raid . Not all the captives were young children, but all were of ethnic Pakhtun origin . The students had been kept chained and told of regular beatings and visits from Taliban fighters . Sanaa TV, a local station, showed footage of the raid and the chained students, who danced and cried as police began to free them. 'We were kept in chains and hung upside down and beaten with sticks if we didn't comply. We were told that we would be given training to fight in Afghanistan,' one boy said. Another told how Taliban fighters had visited the seminary, led prayers and told them to prepare for battle. The raid came after an anonymous tip-off to authorities. Police official Mukhtiar Khaskheli told Agence France-Presse that a full investigation would probe any possible links with militants. 'The madrassa officials claim that they had chained those students because they were drug addicts and they wanted to rehabilitate them and make them better Muslims,' he added. Policemen continue to search the basement of Madrassa Zakarya . Pakistani policemen examine documents found at the Islamic seminary. One cleric and two others were arrested at the scene . According to the Press Trust of India, most of the captive students had been brought to Karachi from remote parts of Khyber Pakhtunkhawa province, a hotbed of Taliban activities. 'What we have learnt is that the parents used to pay the seminary for the education of their children who were sent to Karachi to get religious education,' a police official told the agency. Pakistani government records seen by AFP suggest there are 15,148 seminaries in Pakistan, with more than two million students. But officials suspect many more unregistered schools exist, providing the children of Pakistan's poverty-stricken majority with the only education they can afford.","45 captives tell of visiting Taliban militants who told them: 'Prepare for battle'

"Creating structures in space that astronauts can live in has become a priority for Nasa. With a manned mission to Mars on the agenda, and plans for lunar exploration underway, scientists are increasingly looking towards unconventional construction methods. The most promising of these is 3D printing, which could make building a lunar home in space a matter of pressing a button and letting a robot do the work. Scroll down for video... Building a home both on Earth and the Moon could soon be a matter of pressing a button and letting a robot 'print' the structure . Nasa has now provided funding to the University of Southern California to develop a specific 3D printing technique known as Contour Crafting. According to researchers, Contour Crafting could allow computer-controlled machines to build houses within 24 hours. The layered fabrication technology sees concrete, or other material such as lunar soil, applied in a pre-determined design by a nozzle on a moveable gantry. A process called Contour Crafting allows computer-controlled machines to build houses within 24 hours.

The theory is that 90 per cent of the materials needed to build the structure already exists on the Moon.

It could also be used to print out customised luxury homes, Professor Khoshnevis said. Scientists believe that 90 per cent of the materials needed to build structures on the Moon already exist on its surface.

"It is the eerie old church that featured in Bram Stoker’s gothic novel Dracula. Now St Mary’s in Whitby has become the scene of real horror after human bones began to emerge from their  centuries-old graves.

Yorkshire town in the 1890s. Resident Barry Brown, 56, told how he found several bones in the backyard of his kipper smokehouse, which sits under the cliff. He said: ‘When the subsidence began I . went out and found a few pieces of bone. They’d been buried for God . knows how many years because they were soft and yellow from being in the . soil. 'I managed to identify one hip bone, two pieces of skull and a . large bone that looked like it was part of a leg. ‘It’s quite sad picking that sort of thing up, I expect the people who buried them thought they’d be there for ever. Debris: More cracks have appeared in the cliff face this week following heavy rainfall in Whitby . Problems: Reverend Canon David Smith said the church will have to use money earmarked for repairs to pay for the landslide recovery work . Historic: In 2000 St Mary's Church in Whitby experienced more landslides close to the edge of the graveyard . Iconic: St Mary's church featured in Bram Stoker's classic novel Dracula . Goths who flocked to the graveyard because of its links to Dracula were banned from the churchyard in 2011 . Horror: Christopher Lee in the 1958 horror film Dracula which was inspired by the novel by Bram Stoker (right) ‘It could have even been one of my . relatives, as my family have been here since the early 1800s.’  The . bones were collected soon afterwards by church staff and have since been . reburied in a more stable spot. It is not known who the bones belonged . to, as many of the headstones in the cemetery have been moved around . over the centuries. St Mary’s Reverend Canon David Smith said: ‘The . cemetery has been closed for over a century, so if any graves are . exposed it’s only bones. If anything is exposed we re-inter them.’ The landslide has been blamed on a . drainage pipe which became damaged and fell away. This meant recent . heavy rainfall saturated the soil, which then began to fall. Rev Smith added: ‘The church has been . trying to muck in to get things done and we have had a civil engineer . working to sort it out. ‘They’ve been trying to find where the water was coming from and making the cliff edge more secure.’ As . Bram Stoker sat at his desk overlooking the seaside town of Whitby Bay . in 1890 he noticed the huge number of bats flying around St Mary's . Church. Perched on top of a cliff St Mary's, with its rows upon rows of tombstones, looked out onto the stormy North Sea. It . was the atmospheric surroundings of Whitby and St Mary's Church which . would inspire him to write the classic Gothic novel Dracula published in . 1897. The writer happened to be staying in the town trying to decide whether it would be suitable for a family holiday. However, it became the perfect backdrop for his book. He wrote: 'For a moment or two I could see nothing, as the shadow of a cloud obscured St. Mary's Church. 'Then . as the cloud passed I could see the ruins of the Abbey coming into . view; and as the edge of a narrow band of light as sharp as a sword-cut . moved along, the church and churchyard became gradually visible... 'It . seemed to me as though something dark stood behind the seat where the . white figure shone, and bent over it. What it was, whether man or beast, . I could not tell.' Stoker's . Dracula is shipwrecked off the Yorkshire coast. He comes ashore in the . guise of a black dog and wreaks havoc on the town. Prince . Vlad the Impaler, from Transylvania and known for his bloodthirsty . reputation, is thought to have been the inspiration for Stoker's . character Dracula. One of the characters, Mina, keeps a journal containing detailed descriptions of Whitby and those areas frequented by Dracula. A spokesman for Scarborough Borough . Council said: ‘The cliff is not the responsibility of the council . because it is private land and there is no immediate danger to life or . property.  ‘We have written to the church and have made them aware of . their obligations as landowners.’ Dracula, published in 1897, tells the . story of the vampire Count’s attempt to relocate from Transylvania to . England, leaving a trail of dead in his wake, with his ship running . aground in Whitby in a storm. Stoker hit upon the idea of the count . while reading a history book at Whitby library, and made St Mary’s part . of the story after being struck by the way the bats circled the . building. In one scene, the Count appears in the church cemetery with . his young victim Lucy Westenra. Many visitors to Whitby still ask about Dracula’s grave, forgetting he is a work of fiction. The cemetery, which inspired Bram Stoker when writing his classic novel Dracula, is closed to the public .

"A Spanish magazine landed themselves in the middle of a racial controversy over a Photoshopped picture of First Lady Michelle Obama on the cover of their latest issue. The picture places Mrs Obama's face in a 1800 portrait of a slave with an exposed breast, and Magazine de Fuera de Serie likely knew the image was going to stir up controversy. The editors may have had a different message in mind given the historical context of the particular painting, but that sentiment was overlooked by online viewers who found the composite offensive and racist. Controversial: A Spanish magazine digitally altered a French portrait of a slave to include the First Lady's face . The portrait in question was initially released 1800, when French artist Marie-Guillemine Benoist exhibited the painting, titled Portrait D'Une Négresse, at the Louvre's annual salon. It was viewed as a inspiring image because the country had abolished slavery six years prior, and the portrait was thought of as an uplifting symbol of both women's and black people's rights. In keeping with the true meaning, the accompanying article translates to 'Michelle Granddaughter of a Slave, Lady of America'. Both Mrs Obama's great-great grandfather and great-great-great grandmother were slaves. From the preview of the article appears to be glowing- touting the axiom that 'behind every great man is a great woman'- but the full piece has yet to be released online. That seems not to matter to bloggers who feel the divisiveness of the image skews meaning, whatever it may be. Out of context: The article reportedly praises Mrs Obama's popularity in the run up to the US election . The fact that one of the slave woman's breasts is exposed in the portrait does not help to tone down the composite when it is attached to Michelle Obama's face. 'As a non-Spanish speaker I first looked at the image and just thought OMG that's Michelle Obama's boobs,' writes Jessica Wakeman on The Frisky. According to Clutch Magazine, the image is just one in a series of edited photos that show famous people's faces on the heads of other nudes. Mrs Obama will reportedly be joined by her husband Barack Obama, former President Abraham Lincoln and Princess Diana whose images are inside the magazine. Artist Karine Percheron-Daniels defends the artistic choice, saying that it shows an 'alternative unexpected reality' by allowing the viewer to see 'famous individuals in a different way'.",Magazine digitally altered French portrait of a slave woman from 1800 so that the First Lady's face appears on the nude subject's body .
"QPR chairman Tony Fernandes has taken to Twitter to try and appease disgruntled supporters after his club were left bottom of the Premier League table following their 2-0 defeat to West Ham. After tweeting that the performance of Harry Redknapp's side at Upton Park was 'just not good enough' on Sunday evening, the Malaysian billionaire returned to his social media account to partly explain - and also question why - the club have managed just one win all season. Fernandes was quick to point out that the Hoops bounced back immediately from their relegation to the Championship in 2013 by securing promotion via the play-offs in May. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Harry Redknapp: A tough start but there's a long way to go . QPR chairman Tony Fernandes (right), pictured at Upton Park, was unhappy after his side's 2-0 defeat . West Ham striker Diafra Sakho scores his side's second goal in their 2-0 win against QPR on Sunday . QPR manager Harry Redknapp and his staff look glum as they watch the match unfold at Upton Park . But he insisted that the west London side faced a struggle to assemble a competitive squad during the summer after allowing so many players to leave the club on temporary deals during their year in the second tier. Fernandes wrote: 'We have always been on the backfoot with players. We had so many loans last year as we cleared out. 'That's it. There should be no more excuses from anyone especially me. Buck stops at me. I'm up for the battle.' Redknapp is under pressure to turn around the club's fortunes but it appears he will be given time to do so after Fernandes mentioned his decision to sack Mark Hughes in November 2012 and QPR's subsequent relegation. 'Is sacking the answer. When we met (sic) Mark Hughes go we still went down. Is it tactics ,is it players ,is it coaching ,is it fitness,' he added. Mark Hughes was sacked by QPR in November 2012 but the club were still relegated to the Championship . The 50-year-old was particularly upset with criticism from fans who have suggested the club's failure to replace Loic Remy - who joined Chelsea just before the summer transfer deadline - was to blame for their poor form so far. Fernandes tweeted: 'When we lost Remy 48 hours before deadline day it was huge huge blow. Huge blow. But we fight on. Stop sendind (sic) me ridiculous tweets. 'I'm not stupid or a quitter. All I can assure fans is as always we will be transparent and leave no stone unturned to stay up and build. 'I love the Remy comments.

Loic Remy (right), pictured in action against Aston Villa, left QPR late in the summer transfer window . Fernandes attempted to sign Liverpool's Fabio Borini (left) but a deal could not be agreed . 'Yeah I can pull out a striker in 24 hours. We tried hard with (Fabio) Borini. So pls (sic) tell me me what you would have done. Dammed easy to be arm chair critics.' QPR lost their fifth Premier League game of the campaign against Sam Allardyce's side and have just four points from seven games so far. Fernandes added: 'I don't think the players didn't try yeatersay(sic). 'Look at the stats. The goal was never a goal. Took the wind out of us. The second goal was against the run of play. No excuses.

"This is the sickening moment a violent thug kicked another man in the head 'as if it was a football' as he bent down to tie his shoelaces. Vitalijis Zavjalovs, 22, was captured on CCTV cameras laughing with a friend as he left his victim lying on the ground unconscious following the attack in the early hours of December 8 last year. The footage, which emerged during a court hearing to sentence Zavjalovs, made the presiding magistrate at Wigan and Leigh Magistrates' Court 'wince' as Brian Gallagher was kicked in the head, causing cuts to his face and lips. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . This is the moment Vitalijis Zavjalovs is captured on CCTV kicking Brian Gallagher in the head as he bent down to tie his shoelaces . Zavjalovs can be seen running towards Mr Gallagher before kicking him in the head 'as if it was a football' The footage, taken from town centre cameras in Wigan, Lanashire, shows Zavjalovs running towards Mr Gallagher as he leaves a club, before kicking him hard in the face and knocking him out. The presiding magistrate told Zavjalovs: 'This was a particularly nasty incident. It made me wince watching it just now. 'It was a vicious attack. We are sick and tired of seeing incidents like this in Wigan town centre. 'You kicked his head as if it was a football, he had no way of defending himself and he did not know it was even coming. 'You used a weapon - your foot - we believe it deserves a custodial sentence but you have been shown leniency because you have shown remorse and it was an isolated incident and you have previous good character.' Karen Schofield, defending, said: 'His recollection of the incident is somewhat vague. He had consumed an extremely large quantity of alcohol. Mr Gallagher can be seen falling to the ground after he is kicked by Zavjalovs . Zavjalovs leaves his victim lying on the ground unconscious following the attack in the early hours of December 8 last year . 'He does not go out regularly at weekends, he cannot put forward any legitimate reason why he drank this much on this occasion.' The court was told Zavjalovs had been drinking steadily from 8pm until when the incident occurred at just before 4am. Ms Schofield added: 'When shown the footage, he could not recall any arguments and he could not recognise the victim. The court was told Zavjalovs had been drinking steadily from 8pm until when the incident occurred at just before 4am . 'He is a man who is not a violent individual. He regrets what happened and is remorseful that he caused injury to a male that simply he does not know.' Zavjalovs, from Wigan, pleaded guilty to a charge of assault by beating. He received a four month custodial sentence suspended for 12 months with a specified activity requirement. He will also have to undertake 250 hours of unpaid work, pay £600 compensation to the victim, a £80 victim surcharge and £85 costs, adding up to a total of £765.","Vitalijis Zavjalovs captured on CCTV as he leaves victim unconscious .

"A Game of Thrones Fan sent an official request to Wigan Council, asking what plans were in place to protect the town from a dragon attack. The request topped a list of the most bizarre requests sent to local councils under the Freedom of Information act. The second 'wackiest' request asked how many animals had been frozen in Cambridge since March 2012, while Rossendale Council was asked how often it had used exorcists' services on children and pets. A Game of Thrones fan sent a Freedom of Information request to Wigan Council, asking what plans were in place to protect the town from a dragon attack . Another curious resident asked Southend Council how many children in its area had been micro-chipped. The list was published by the Local Government Association, which represents local councils. It used the list to illustrate how it believes resources are being diverted to from vital services to deal with these requests. The association also complained that firms were 'exploiting the system' by trying to find out information on existing suppliers to help them bid for public contracts. Peter Fleming, chairman of the LGA's Improvement Board, said: 'While the majority of requests to councils are for details of council policy and expenditure, some of the FOI requests received do not relate very closely to the services they are focused on providing every day of the year.

"Barcelona delivered one of their worst performances of the season and Lionel Messi had his first off day of the year as Luis Enrique’s team were beaten 1-0 at home by Malaga just three days before they face Manchester City. If Manuel Pellegrini wants a masterclass in how to play Barcelona he need only look to the way his old club have played them this season. They drew 0-0 at La Rosaleda earlier in the season and never looked into too much trouble at the Camp Nou after Juanmi put them ahead on seven minutes after a mistake by Dani Alves. Barcelona looked fragile at the back with Malaga’s lightning breaks exposing their high defensive line. They were second to everything in midfield and with Messi and Neymar strangely below par they blew their big chance to go top of La Liga. Malaga's striker Juanmi Jimenez (left) celebrates after scoring the opening goal at the Nou Camp . Barcelona forward Lionel Messi (left) vies with Malaga's forward Samuel Castillejo (right) on Saturday . Barcelona started brightly enough with Suarez forcing several corners but from the second Malaga broke away to score. Carlos Kameni saved Suarez’ header and the former Espanyol keeper, booed for his ties to Barça’s Catalan rivals, set-up the first goal of the game with a long kick down the pitch. It looked harmless enough as it dropped out of the sky with Alves underneath it. But the full-back miscontrolled it as he tried to send it back to keeper Claudio Bravo. Malaga’s 21-year-old striker Juanmi pounced on the error and with Bravo slow to come out and cover Alves’ mistake the forward was able to slip it past him and make it 1-0. Barça did their best to respond immediately but Kameni came out to clear an Alba cross ahead of Suarez who complained the keeper had used his elbows as both players went for the ball. Rafinha then had a shot blocked by Weligton on the line. The Barcelona midfielder was then booked for bringing down Recio as things went from bad to worse for the home side. Barca defender Dani Alves (right) tussles for possession with Malaga midfielder Pablo Javier Perez (left) Barcelona were finding no way through Malaga’s two banks of four defence and the tactic of hanging high balls up for Suarez was proving food and drink to Kameni who dominated his area. When Messi crossed from the right he did manage to keep it far enough away from the keeper but from the chance Neymar made an uncharacteristic mess of his control and the ball ran out for a goal kick. Moments later Neymar combined brilliantly with Iniesta and his cross was bound for Messi but former Real Madrid defender Miguel Torres got to the ball first. Suarez crossed from left but Neymar couldn’t control the ball. Then roles were reversed with Neyamr’s cross cut out before it reached Suarez. Messi, meanwhile, was mysteriously peripheral. The tactic of having him spend more time wide right this season has worked since the turn of the year but not here. Barcelona's Lionel Messi looks on dejected after Juanmi's goal put visitors Malaga ahead in the first half . Barcelona supporters behind Kameni’s goal sang sarcastically about how much they love Ronaldo – after the League’s recent decision to charge the club for singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ songs – and the Camp Nou waited for the first half equalizer, but it never came. At times it was Malaga who looked more likely to get the game’s next goal. They were dangerous on the break with Samuel playing in Darder. He flicked the ball to Ricardo Horta and only a Bravo save stopped the second goal. Alves then allowed Castillejo to get away from him and Pique was lucky not to have been judged to have fouled the forward as he cleared up his team-mate’s mistake. Alves had been particularly bad but the sloppiness had spread through the team and going forward there was a complete lack of punch. Gerard Pique (right) is at full stretch in an attempt to keep the ball in play during Saturday's La Liga clash . From a Messi centre Iniesta headed weakly at Kameni with the effort never looking like beating Kameni. It was fitting that the last kick of the first half was an aimless crossfield pass from Messi that went straight to a blue and white striped shirt. From their talisman to their previously unflappable keeper Barcelona had been awful. With no notable improvement at the start of the second period Luis Enrique sent on midfielder Ivan Rakitic. The Croatian replaced Rafinha on the hour. Suarez took the fight to Malaga but strayed offside running onto a Messi pass and was also just the wrong side of his marker when Pedro played him through with his first kick after replacing Iniesta. Luis Suarez writhes around in agony as his side searched for a response to get back into the game . As Suarez played Rakitic down the right he was flagged offside too – Malaga played the tactic well but were being helped a linesman who seemed not to agree with level being onside. Suarez was inline with the last defender as he ran onto Messi’s pass and could not believe it when the official raised his flag. When Pedro finally beat the offside trap he sent his shot into the side-netting. With 15 minutes left Javier Mascherano replaced Alves at right back. It was hardly the substitution that was going to change the game but it was a chance to point the finger at the player whose mistake had started the whole shambles. This was Barcelona’s first defeat since the first game of the year when David Moyes’ Real Sociedad beat them. After that game the blame was all placed at tinkering Luis Enrique’s door. This time the buck stops squarely with the players and Manchester City’s only fear will be that they will be more determined than ever to put things right in their next game. Reflecting on his side's performance at the Nou Camp, Barca boss Enrique was less than impressed: 'I would go as far as to say we deserved to lose the game. 'It’s an advantage that we have a game in just three days time and it’s a very big one.'","Malaga put themselves ahead with a first half goal from Juanmi Jimenez .

"Nilson Dos Santos, the barista at the centre of a race row at a Sydney café, has revealed his delight at landing a new job after being told people ‘don’t want their coffee made by black people’. Mr Dos Santos, a Brazilian who has lived in Australia for nine years, was shocked when the owner of Forbes and Burton Café refused to hire him when he arrived at the inner Sydney café 10 days ago. The 37-year-old was so enraged that he stood up and told the patrons of the café what the owner, Steven Hu, had said to him, prompting a mass walk-out from customers and a staff member. The story, which was first reported by Daily Mail Australia, garnered worldwide attention and caused such public outrage in Sydney that the café has since shut its doors and is being investigated by the Fair Work Ombudsman. But now Mr Dos Santos can finally put the ordeal behind him with a new full-time job making coffee at Darlinghurst establishment Coco Cubano – about four minutes’ walk from Forbes and Burton. ‘I’m so excited, it’s such a relief. When I heard I had the job, it’s the first time I’ve really smiled since this whole crazy thing happened,’ he told Daily Mail Australia. Scroll down for video . Nilson Dos Santos is working as a barista at his new job (pictured.) He is excited and ready to move on with his life. Ten days ago, he was told customers 'do not want their coffee made by a black person' by the owner of another inner Sydney café. The 37-year-old barista is thankful for all the 'beautiful support' he has received and is excited for a new start. ‘I’m moving house too… There are lots of new starts, it’s a new beginning. ‘I feel very happy for my new job. I feel that it’s time to move on.’ Mr Dos Santos said he was hugely grateful to all the support he’d received since his story broke, describing the feedback from members as the public as ‘beautiful’. ‘I wish I could hug and thank every one of the people for the support they have given to me,’ he said. ‘The beautiful thing is how something so negative has become something so positive. ‘But now, when the hard times come for me, I will always know how much love that I have and how after this crazy thing people made me feel so strong. I will always hold onto that beautiful memory.’ Nilson was denied a job at Forbes and Burton cafe in Darlinghurst, just a few blocks away from his new workplace . Steven Hu, pictured above, told Mr Dos Santos that customers 'didn't want to be served by black people' Nilson Dos Santos (pictured at his new job at Coco Cubano in Darlinghurst) couldn't believe that people heard about his story all over the world and how something 'so negative has become something so positive' Mr Dos Santos was overwhelmed by the reaction and couldn’t believe that people heard about his story all over the world. ‘A friend of mine lives in Germany at the moment and he called me and he said “Nilson, what happened? Everybody’s talking about you right now. It’s big news here!”,’ he said. ‘Friends of mine who live in Hong Kong sent me his love, everyone talked about it in Brazil as well. It’s been much bigger than I thought it would ever be. It shows how kind people can be.’ The barista was inundated with job offers, revealing he was contacted by about 40 cafes after the news broke. He said it had been a very humbling experience. ‘I am very, very happy about my new job, it feel fantastic to be secure about my job and they will be loyal to you and look after you – that was exactly what I was looking for,’ he said. The Brazillian-born Australian citizen is still very proud to be Australian and happy that he chose to live here. Mr Dos Santos wants to assure the public that he still feels welcome and 'free' in Sydney. Mr Dos Santos is now encouraging others to stand up against discrimination and hopes that people can learn from his experience. ‘You always have to believe in yourself and stand up for yourself. Don’t let somebody else let you down. Wherever you come from, whatever colour you have, that’s not the point,’ he said. ‘The point is that you must be respected and you must be loved because you deserve that. ‘If I can do it, everyone else can do it. If it’s happening to you, try to do it. Don’t let anybody else tell you you’re not able to do something.’ Mr Dos Santos received more than forty job offers, from people who wished to have the smiling Brazillian make coffees for their customers. He is working full-time at Coco Cubano, an establishment in Darlinghurst. But while the newly employed barista is still angry about what happened, he revealed he’s disappointed to see people respond negatively to his story by vandalising Forbes and Burton café. He says he tried to return to the café to ‘face what happened’ on the weekend but says he was distressed to see that the café had been vandalised. ‘On Sunday I thought it was time to face what happened and go past the coffee shop – just out the front,’ he said. ‘But I saw all the eggs on the shop windows and that it was close and I broke down and cried.’ Mr Dos Santos, pictured at his new job, hopes that people who are also being discriminated against speak out. 'If I can do it, you can too!' he told Daily Mail Australia. Mr Dos Santos said the support from the gay and Aboriginal communities had been ‘fantastic’, and added that despite recent events he feels like ‘Australia is home’. ‘I always loved Australia and now I’d say that I’m in love with this country. This is my home, this is where I want to be,’ he said. ‘I was always looking for somewhere to call home. That was my dream when I was a child. I’ve always just wanted somewhere so I could say “that’s my home”. And I have that in Australia.’ He said that when Coco Cubano asked him what he wanted out of life – a question that some may struggle with in an interview – he didn’t hesitate to answer. ‘It’s simple. My aspiration in life is to be happy.’","Nilson Dos Santos is thrilled to have a new job at an inner Sydney café .

"The Spanish League will decide Tuesday afternoon if they are going to take action against Barcelona supporters singing ‘Ronaldo is a drunk’ at the Camp Nou on Sunday night. The League have officials at every La Liga match and the one at Barcelona’s meeting with Levante at the weekend included hearing the song in their report. If the Spanish League reports it to the Antiviolence Committee Barcelona could be fined or even have a part of the Nou Camp closed. The steps being considered are a result of Spanish football’s intention of cutting out all forms of crowd trouble or incitement to crowd trouble since a Deportivo supporter was killed in a pitched battle before a match at Atletico Madrid’s Vicente Calderon stadium in November. Barcelona fans chanted 'Ronaldo is a drunk' about Real Madrid star Cristiano at the Nou Camp . Barcelona could now face disciplinary action from the Spanish league. Pictured is their star man Lionel Messi . Despite what some might term 'terrace banter' appearing to have little to do with the organised violence that ended with a supporter being beaten to death outside a stadium last year, the football authorities have included chants and songs in their crackdown on trouble. Barca fan taunts followed Ronaldo’s 30th birthday party when he was videoed and photographed celebrating after a 4-0 defeat by Atletico Madrid. The league threatened similar action for sections of the Bernabeu chanting ‘Messi is retarded’ in December but none was taken.

The first game is at our place so we have to make sure we play with a lot of intensity and get a good result that we can take back to the Camp Nou.' Navas, 29, has also got one eye on a return to Spain. Asked about finishing his career at his home club Sevilla he said: ‘It would be nice to finish up there. That is the club that have given me everything and it would be a nice ending to my career.’ City's defence will have to deal with the threat of Lionel Messi, who has 14 goals in 10 games for Barcelona . Another of Manchester City's Spanish connections is the technical director of the club’s academy Rodolfo Borrell who coached Leo Messi, Cesc Fabregas and Gerard Pique when he worked at Barcelona’s famous La Masia youth system. Borrell told Mundo Deportivo that Barça’s Cuidad Deportivo has nothing on City’ s new £200m Etihad Campus. He said: ‘You can’t compare them. Ours is spectacular. But that is as you would expect when something is the latest then it can draw on more ideas for its inspiration.’ City technical director Rodolfo Borrell says City's new training complex in better than Barcelona's . City stars including Navas, Fernando (centre), Scott Sinclair (third right) and Dedryck Boyata (second right) maintain their fitness on bikes . Borrell who also worked under Rafa Benitez in Liverpool’s academy helping to bring through Raheem Sterling among others backed City’s state of the art academy to be a match for Barcelona’s in terms of end product in years to come. He said: ‘I am a Barça fan and I grew up with that way of understanding football but we are looking for our own identity here. A club cannot spend millions on players season after season. It has to create the structure that will enable it to bring through its own talent.’","Manchester City face Barcelona in the Champions League next Tuesday .

"Real Madrid were taken apart by Atletico Madrid at the Estadio Vicente Calderon with Cristiano Ronaldo and Gareth Bale spectators as Diego Simone’s side ran riot in a 4-0 victory. It is the first time in 64 years that Real have lost three straight games in the ground of their neighbours but this was different – this was embarrassing for the richest club in football, smothered from the first kick to last by their poor-relations city neighbours. Real's £250m forward line of Bale, Ronaldo and Karim Benzema mustered just one shot in a first half dominated by Atletico Madrid who scored twice through Tiago and Saul.

Atletico Madrid (4-4-2): Moya; Juanfran, Miranda, Godin, Siqueira; Tiago, Koke (Saul 10 [Garcia 71]), Gabi, Turan; Griezmann (Torres 77), Mandzukic. Subs not used: Suarez, Oblak, Gamez, Giminez. Scorers: Tiago, Saul, Greizmann, Mandzukic. Booked: Godin, Gabi, Turan, Mandzukic, Garcia. Real Madrid (4-3-3): Casillas; Coentrao, Nacho, Varane, Carvajal; Khedira (Jese 46), Kroos, Isco (Illaramendi 68); Bale, Ronaldo, Benzema (Hernandez 73). Subs not used: Navas, Lucas Silva, Arbeloa. Llorente. Booked: Kroos, Jese. Referee: David Fernandez. Att: 54000. And in the second half the suffering continued when the brilliant Antoine Griezmann added a third and Mario Mandzukic made it four. A shell-shocked Carlo Ancelotti said after the game. ‘They deserved to win because they won in every facet: they won the battle and they won the football match. We will have to change our attitude going forward. ‘We were second to everything; we lost all the aerial challenges, we weren’t in the game. None of our players played well. It’s the worst performance since I have been the manager.’ Simeone said: ‘The way the players carried out the plan was brilliant. We went about the job very seriously and now we need to keep going forward the same way.’ Asked if they were now title candidates he said: ‘We still take it one get at a time.’ And when it was put to him that it was one of his greatest games in charge of Atletico Madird he said: ‘No, it was just another a league game’. Atletico Madrid shot out of the blocks. In contrast Real Madrid were strolling and it wasn’t long before they were paying the price for that lack of intensity. Gabi’s Corner on 13 minutes was brought down by Mandzukic who laid it back to Tiago on the edge of the area. The former Chelsea midfielder shot through a crowded penalty area and Iker Casillas fumbled the effort and allowed it to squirm over the line. ‘Iker Iker’ sung the Atletico Madrid supporters. They had been given a helping hand by Real’s keeper, not that they needed it. Real Madrid were playing without three of their first-choice back four and it was showing with Fabio Coentrao struggling to deal with Arda Turan and Nacho and Raphael Varane not able to handle Mandzukic. Perhaps their preoccupation with the Croat striker was the reason why they left Saul in so much space in the penalty area on 19 minutes. The young midfielder who was out on loan at Rayo Vallecano last season and interesting a host of Premier League clubs had only been on the pitch for nine minutes replacing the injured Koke. Siqueira got away from Dani Carvajal, dribbled along the byline and pulled the ball back where Saul finished with an acrobatic scissor kick past a this-time faultless Casillas. Carvajal had received no support from Bale who had more importantly been anonymous in attack down the Madrid right. Likewise Ronaldo was missing in action down the left. By half time Carlo Ancelotti had seen enough and put Ronaldo at centre forward bringing, on Jese at the expense of Sami Khedira but it made no real difference. Real were fortunate to only be two goals down at half-time. Griezmann had scored what would have been a third only to be incorrectly flagged offside. And a Godin shot had hit Khedira on the face and then the hand leaving Atletico players demanding a penalty.

Atletico's Turkish midfielder Arda Turan tussles for the ball with Portguese full back Fabio Coentrao . Real Madrid manager Carlo Ancelotti issues instructions to his players during the second half . Real had managed just one shot in the first half and it was notable that no Real Madrid player said anything to a team-mate walking off the pitch – each one leaving the pitch with his head down. Perhaps they were saving it for the dressing room. Real improved at the start of the second half and with Raul Garcia booked for dissent while warming up on the touchline and Turan also cautioned there was hope for Real, but it was false hope. Griezmann continued to threaten after the break. First Casillas palmed away his shot, he then bicycle-kicked just over from Saul’s cross, and then headed Juanfran’s cross over. He was also involved in the build up to what should have been a brilliant third. Real were left dizzy from Atletico’s passing football down the right and when Juanfran crossed, Tiago sent his free-header into the arms of Casillas. The third did come however and no one deserved it more than Griezmann. This was now embarrassing for Real Madrid. They have been out-fought by Simeone's team before, but never out-played like this. The last time Atletico Madrid had beaten Real 3-0 at home in the league it was 1970. Ancelotti brougth on Hernandez for Benzema but everyone connected with Real Madrid just wanted the final whistle. Atletico didn’t want it to end. Simeone was conducting the crowd and Fernando Torres was on for the brilliant Griezmann and looking for a goal of his own. Real forced their first corner and Asier Illaramendi shot just over but Real were still sinking and the Estadio Vicente Calderon, who had greeted the two teams with a sea of red and white flags at the start, were now doing the ‘Mexican Wave’ as the clock ran down. Torres never got his goal but he did set up Mandzukic to convert the fourth and complete the humiliating rout. Once again Simeone had masterminded an extraordinary victory. Ronaldo said: ‘It’s a terrible day for us. We are very annoyed because everything was missing – desire, attitude. Real Madrid can’t lose 4-0 against any team in the world. But I am still convinced we will win the league.' Atletico Madrid No 9 Mandzukic holds off the challenge of Ignacio 'Nacho' Fernandez .

"Queens Park Rangers defender Clint Hill’s furious exchange with a supporter on Saturday was sparked by his fears for one of the club’s young fans. Hill was involved in an angry confrontation with a Rangers fan, who had a child with him, following QPR’s loss at Burnley. The supporter launched into an x-rated tirade at Hill and team-mate Richard Dunne, questioning the pair’s commitment. Dunne responded with a foul-mouthed tongue-lashing of his own before Hill, who has helped the club to two promotions during his time at Loftus Road, became embroiled in the incident. Sportsmail understands Hill’s issue with the supporter was the language he was using in front of the child, who is said to have looked ‘petrified’. QPR captain Joey Barton restrains Clint Hill at full-time who was remonstrating with a disgruntled away fan . The ill-tempered situation is understood to have continued outside the ground as other Rangers fans confronted the supporter in question. The loss at Turf Moor was QPR’s 10th in a row on the road in the Premier League this season — the worst away run in the top-flight for 50 years. Joey Barton said: ‘These are testing times. There is no hiding place. We have to show a big set of b******s and pick ourselves up. ‘We have got Manchester United coming up (on Saturday) and we have to go and start digging results out. It’s just a case of head down and graft. I’ve never been in a situation like this before — so good at home and so poor away.’ A section of travelling fans were unhappy as the side fell to their 10th consecutive away Premier League loss . Harry Redknapp was furious with the two goals QPR gave away in the first half as Scott Arfield and Danny Ings scored either side of a penalty converted by former Burnley favourite Charlie Austin. And Barton echoed Redknapp’s sentiments, saying: ‘He’s as p****d off as anyone. The goals we gave away were absolutely shocking. If you defend like that at this level you are going to be punished.’ A deserved fourth victory of the season saw Burnley move out of the relegation zone, and their next three league fixtures are against the teams directly above them in the table: Crystal Palace, Sunderland and West Brom. ‘The next month is big,’ admitted defender Michael Keane. ‘We want to stay in this league and we believe with the performances we’ve put in recently we can do that. We need to win our games at home against the teams around us.’ The England Under-21 international was making his first appearance since turning his loan from Manchester United into a £2million move. ‘I’d been there for nearly 12 years but I thought it was the right time,’ he said. ‘It’s not a step back because I’m playing in the Premier League. If I was there I wouldn’t have been, so it’s actually a step forward if you look at it like that.’ QPR central defender Richard Dunne on the ball against Burnley on Saturday, was also involved in the incident .","Burnley defeated Queens Park Rangers 2-1 on Saturday afternoon .

"Kimani Gray, 16, was fatally wounded late Saturday evening in Brooklyn after allegedly pointing a handgun at undercover police officers . An orderly protest over the death of an armed 16-year-old turned into a riot in Brooklyn tonight after young people started lashing out at NYPD officers. Between 60 and 100 rioters gathered around Church and Snyder Ave. in East Flatbush and threw bottles and other debris at police, witnesses said, following a vigil for Kimani Gray, 16, who was shot dead by two plainclothes officers over the weekend. One person has been arrested, though no injuries have been reported. They were lashing out at the NYPD, who they believe are responsible for the teen’s death. An NYPD spokesperson confirmed to MailOnline that there was a ‘large disorderly group throwing bottles at police.’ They said the protest began around 8:30pm tonight but the crowd is being dispersed by police. New York City Councilman Jumaane D. Williams, who represents the area of Flatbush, has been tweeting live updates, and said: ‘I’m in the middle of the riot action at Church and Snyder in my district. Right now, things are tense. Young people have expressed anger.’ Mr Williams later described the scene of chaos in Flatbush, saying that garbage cans had been overturned and people smashed out windows. He added that one person had been attacked outside of a local Rite Aid. ‘Tonight was a peaceful vigil that devolved into a riot,’ he wrote. ‘The youth in this community have no outlets for their anger, no community.’ Another Twitter user who is apparently at the site said that the riot 'sounds like a war zone.' Scroll down for video . Gone awry: Between 60-100 people turned out to protest the shooting death of an armed 16-year-old in East Flatbush, Brooklyn tonight . Dissipating: One person was hurt and one injured when the protests turned violent; one witness tweeted this picture saying that the crowds had slowly thinned . Vigil: The 'riot' started out a peaceful vigil for Kimani Gray; dozens of candles were lit and people placed posters and flowers near the space he was shot . A source told the New York Daily News that the protest began some 20 blocks from where Gray was fatally shot. The march went past the 67th Presinct station, where officers impeded the protest’s progress. That’s when the peaceful protest got out of hand. Different accounts: Kimani Gray's sister said that her brother had more 'common sense' than to point a loaded gun at NYPD officers . The unnamed NYPD officer told the Daily News that they saw teens jumping on cars and throwing bottles at officers. Gray, 16, was shot eleven times after police said he pulled out a .357 revolver in East Flatbush, Brooklyn over the weekend. Police say they came across a group . of young men on Saturday evening and saw Gray acting suspiciously, walking away from his friends when he saw the officers approach. Officers say the 16-year old began to adjust his waistband and started to act suspiciously. Gray . then turned around and pointed a .357 caliber gun at them, according to police accounts. When the two . plainclothes officers saw the weapon they responded by opening fire. The teen was rushed to Kings County Hospital but he later died. However, witnesses to the shooting say that the NYPD's account is wrong. Gray’s older sister, Mahnefah Gray, 19, told the New York Times that one of the witnesses of the shooting told her that her brother was only fixing his belt. She added that her brother had too much ‘common sense’ to point a loaded gun at an officer, and doubted that he was even carrying a gun at all. A woman who lives across the street from the scene of the shooting told the Times that Gray was calling out: ‘Please don’t let me die!’ and said the officers yelled back: ‘Stay down, or we’ll shoot you again.’ Grey lived in nearby Crown Heights, but had grown up in East Flatbush and returned there to visit friends. His older brother, Jamar, was killed in a car accident two years ago. Weapon: The NYPD released this image of the gun recovered from the scene of the shooting . Shooting: Two plainclothes police officers fatally shot a 16-year-old in Brooklyn last night, after the teen allegedly pulled a loaded gun on them . Investigation: The police have said the revolver that Gray brandished (red box) was loaded . According to witnesses, when the two . cops arrived on the scene in an unmarked car, Gray was part of a group . of six teenagers standing by the side of the road. One of Gray's friends, Devonte Brown told the New York Post: 'As the cops opened fire, he was screaming, ‘Stop! I’m not running!’ His friends have not explained exactly what caused the police officers to shoot. Police say Gray's gun was loaded with four bullets but have not yet determined whether the teenager fired his weapon. Gray had been in trouble with the law before, having been arrested three times since October and had previously been charged with grand larceny and inciting a riot.

"Luke Donald has been suffering in a dark space in recent times but the former world No 1 believes he can start to see some shafts of light at the end of a long tunnel. The Englishman's confidence has taken something of a battering but he was bathed in smiles on Sunday after two eagles helped him conclude his Turkish Airlines Open campaign with a five-under-par 67. Donald improved with each passing day at the European Tour's penultimate event of the season, following a poor opening 74 on Thursday and subsequent rounds of 73 and 68. Luke Donald enjoyed a strong finish to the Turkish Airlines Open in Antalya last week . But Donald has had plenty to ponder during his slump in form in the last two years . 'It's been a bit frustrating lately,' the 36-year-old said in a typically understated way on a sun-kissed day by the Mediterranean. 'I've been banging my head against a wall for the last few months. It's tough when you know you are a capable player and it's not quite happening for you. 'This game will get to you sometimes but I'm quietly confident with the work I've been doing with my coach and it's starting to pay off,' added Donald, who has slipped to 37th in the world having spent 56 weeks at the top of the rankings in 2011 and 2012. Luke Donald's year-end world ranking: . 2009 - 28 . 2010 - 9 . 2011 - 1 . 2012 - 2 . 2013 - 17 . 2014 - ? (Current rank 39) 'For three or four months there I wasn't really making any birdies and this weekend I've started to score well. It's a good sign that it's all starting to come back.' Having endured the agony of missing out on a place in Europe's victorious Ryder Cup team in Scotland in September, Donald reunited with former coach Pat Goss after admitting the radical swing change he underwent with Chuck Cook had not worked. 'Pat and I are doing meticulous work from 150 yards and in, I'm trying to again be one of the best in the world from that kind of distance,' he explained. 'I'm never going to be a power player so controlling the ball from 150 yards and in is important for me. 'Any time you're working on those kind of things it's always difficult because you really want to go out on the course without many thoughts,' said the four-time Ryder Cup player. 'Right now, I've got a few thoughts out there but every day it seems to be getting a little better.' The Englishman was world No 1 but has been searching for the key to win his elusive first major . Donald's strengths have always lain in his short game, such as his prowess from bunkers . Donald is regarded as one of the best players never to have won a major and he is now attempting to focus on the areas of his game which once put him on top of the world. 'I'm trying to be very good again at what I'm usually good at. I had got away from that for most of this season,' said the Chicago-based Englishman after finishing in a tie for 32nd position in Turkey with a six-under tally of 282. 'I don't want to concentrate too much on my perceived weaknesses, like my driving and long irons, but try and focus on my strengths.' Donald, who started his round at the 10th on Sunday, received the welcome boost of eagle threes at the 18th and fourth holes. 'It's been quite a while since I've had two eagles in the same round,' he smiled, 'I don't generally have too many in a year. 'I finally hit the fairway at the 18th, which helps, and then had a three-wood from about 270 yards, caught a ridge perfectly and wound up eight feet away. 'Then at the fourth I hit a three-iron to tap-in distance. They are nice eagles when you don't have to stress too much about the putts.' It sounds like Donald has had more than enough stress to contend with in recent months. 'You definitely start to have doubts and you don't have as much confidence over the ball,' he said. 'You've got to build that slowly through good practice and good tournament rounds like today.'","Luke Donald believes his form is starting to turn around after tough year .

"President Obama admitted that there will be no 'quick fixes' in the fight against ISIS, after meeting with the defense chiefs of 22 countries to coordinate strategy on Tuesday. After emerging from the meeting at Andrews Air Force Base, the president said the mission 'is going to be a long-term campaign'. 'There will be days of progress and there are going to be periods of setback,' Mr Obama said. Scroll down for video . No 'quick fixes': President Obama met with the defense chiefs of 22 nations on Tuesday to discuss military operations against ISIS . Clouds: Smoke rises following an airstrike by the US-led coalition in Kobane, as seen from Mursitpinar on the outskirts of Suruc, at the Turkey-Syria border . Choking: Thick black smoke rises after an American airstrike on an ISIS target inside Kobane this morning . The President added that ISIS presents a unique challenge to the coalition due to the influx of foreigners entering Syria to fight. 'We are going to have to pay attention to how all the countries in the region begin to cooperate in rooting out this cancer and we are going to have to continue on delivering the humanitarian assistance of all the populations that have been affected,' President Obama said. No major decisions were expected at yesterday's meeting, as none of the defense chiefs are policeymakers in their respective countries. Representatives from Australia, Bahrain, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Germany, Iraq, Italy, Jordan, Kuwait, Lebanon, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Turkey and the United Arab Emirates were expected at the meeting. Representatives of the Syrian rebels currently fighting ISIS on the ground were not expected as the meeting was for sovereign nations only.

The Middle East and Scandanavia :General Ghanim of Qatar (left) and the Netherlands' Gen Middendor (right) listen at the Tuesday meeting held at Andrews Air Force Base . 'This meeting is to share our vision, discuss coordination and our common understanding of the way ahead,' a senior U.S. official said before the meetings. However, one item the group did agree on was a name for the military operation, which the Pentagon is expected to announce as soon as today. The name will be revealed once a document covering the entire mission is published by the Defense Department's Joint Staff. Tuesday's meeting was the fourth - and largest - to occur in recent months between the nations fighting ISIS. The previous meetings took place in Jordan, Paris and Bonn. So far, the president's strategy on fighting ISIS has been called into question . At the head of the table: President Obama spoke at the meeting amid calls from U.S. lawmakers to design a more targeted military strategy against the terrorist group, currently taking up large swaths of Syria and Iraq . Referring to ISIS, Republican Senator John McCain said on Sunday that 'they're winning and we're not'. The United Nations said yesterday that fighting in Iraq's western Anbar province had forced up to 180,000 people to flee after ISIS, captured the city of Hit. Anthony Cordesman, national security analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies said the fight against ISIS 'hasn't gone badly, but it certainly hadn't gone well'. He added that it was 'very important' that Obama had to show both Americans and other countries that he was 'committed' to the fight. President Barack Obama will today meet military chiefs from around the world to discuss plans to counter the Islamic State, amid growing pressure for the U.S. to do more to stop the terrorist group . The news comes as it emerged the U.S. will send an army headquarters to Iraq for the first time in three years to assist local security forces struggling to resist advances by the Islamic State. The establishment of a new divisional headquarters in Baghdad will involve about 500 fighters from the U.S. 1ST Infantry Division, with the majority stationed in Iraq, according to The Times. Despite being expertly trained and expensively equipped, the Iraqi army is plagued by low morale and incompetence. The vast majority of Iraqi territory that has fallen into ISIS' hands only did so because the soldiers abandoned their posts in the face of a well-organised but massively outnumbered ISIS advance. In recent days ISIS have pushed ever closer to Baghdad, seizing control of an army base in the strategic town of Heet, which allowed the terrorists to push towards the entire capture of Anbar province, leaving the Iraqi capital completely surrounded.","Barack Obama met with the military chiefs of 22 nations on Tuesday to discuss strategy against ISIS .
The leaders reportedly came to a decision on what to name the operation, which the Pentagon is expected to announce as early as Wednesday ."
"Cristiano Ronaldo risked the wrath of Real Madrid fans by attending his belated 30th birthday party just hours after suffering a humiliating derby-day defeat to Atletico Madrid. Around 150 revellers gathered at the exclusive 'In Zalacain' venue in the millionaires' row 'La Finca' district on the outskirts of Madrid to party the night away as supporters in the city drowned their sorrows after the 4-0 defeat at the hands of Diego Simeone's team.

"Not many sides, if any, could lose their first-choice goalkeeper and replace them with a Premier League and Champions League winner. But Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was able to hand Petr Cech only his second league start of the season — with No 1 Thibaut Courtois struggling with a fractured finger — in their win against Newcastle. The club were keen to stress the injury sustained by Courtois in their defeat to Tottenham would not have prevented him starting the match, but they were in the position of having a world-class player in reserve. Petr Cech was between the sticks for the Chelsea against Newcastle with Thibaut Courtois left on the bench . Chelsea's veteran goalkeeper Cech made a number of important saves against Newcastle . Were it not for Cech, who until this summer had been first-choice for a decade, Chelsea could easily have been behind before Oscar and Diego Costa scored either side of half-time to secure an awkward victory. Newcastle dominated the first half and when Remy Cabella was through on goal Cech flung himself low to save a shot that looked destined for the bottom left corner. Mourinho fielded £12.5million defender Kurt Zouma with Gary Cahill struggling with the volume of games over the busy festive period. The club are confident of their squad depth after planning last summer to compete for the Premier League, Champions League, FA Cup and League Cup. ‘We have great faith in our squad,’ assistant manager Steve Holland explained. ‘When it was assembled at the start of the season it was with the objective to compete for all four titles. ‘That means it’s a 60-plus match season, which means you need a pool of players, 11 is not enough. The Newcastle game was a case of utilising that pool.’ Meanwhile, Mourinho endorsed counter-part John Carver, who has been in temporary charge of Newcastle since Alan Pardew left for Crystal Palace, during an exchange on the touchline. Young Belgian keeper Courtois was left on the bench due to a minor finger injury . Oscar passed the Blues ahead with the minimum of fuss at Stamford Bridge on Saturday afternoon . Diego Costa looked delighted when he added a second for Chelsea just before the hour-mark . But Carver is yet to win in his three games in charge. They drew 3-3 with Burnley and were beaten by Leicester in the FA Cup before Saturday’s defeat. He predicts he will know if he has got the job on a permanent basis in a fortnight, adding: ‘What you have to bear in mind is that we’ve got Southampton next Saturday, then we are not playing the following week because we’re out of the FA Cup so there is a little bit of time there. ‘It’s been two weeks now, so by that time comes round it will be a month. That is a long time to get ready to decide what you are going to do, so I think it should all be in place by then.’ Super stat: Chelsea have won all 10 home league games this season and scored at least twice in each.","Chelsea beat Newcastle United 2-0 at Stamford Bridge .

"Fears that Premier League television revenue would help Manchester United or Manchester City sign Sergio Busquets are behind the Catalan club’s fast-tracking of the player’s contract extension. The Spain international’s current deal runs until 2018 but despite having three years left on his contract, the club have offered him a two-year extension and a pay rise that will take his salary to £7.4m and see him become the fifth-highest earner at the club behind Leo Messi, Neymar, Andres Iniesta and Luis Suarez. The announcement last week of the Premier League’s latest television deal sent shockwaves through Spanish football and Barcelona director Raul Sanllehi met with Busquets’ agent Josep Maria Orobitg this week to discuss improved terms. Barcelona are keen to tie down Sergio Busquets (left) and keep him away from interested Manchester clubs . Louis van Gaal (left) and Manuel Pellegrini have the resources after the sale of Premier League TV rights . Manchester City sporting director Txiki Begiristain and Chief Executive Ferran Soriano know Busquets and Orobitg – who is also Pep Guardiola’s agent – well from their days at Barcelona. Manchester United’s interest is understood to have been driven by Louis Van Gaal who wants the club to stop the indiscriminate buying of forward players and bring in a holding midfielder that he can build a team around. Paris Saint-Germain have also made their interest known with speculation claiming they had already bid £56m for the World Cup winner. Busquets accompanied Barcelona team-mates to attend the 'Camp Tito Vilanova' inauguration ceremony . Barcelona travel to the Etihad for their Last 16 Champions League clash with Manchester City next week . In return for Busquets' pay-hike Barcelona want the player’s buy-out clause raised from the current £111m mark to £130m in a symbolic gesture that will ward off the Manchester clubs. With elections at the end of the season current president Josep Bartomeu knows the photograph of him sat down with Busquets prolonging his commitment to the club he debuted for in 2008 will help his campaign. The club are confident the player will put pen to paper after next week’s first-leg last-16 Champions League match with Manchester City at the Etihad.","Barcelona are prepared to make Sergio Busquets their fifth highest earner .

"Harry Redknapp has stunned Queens Park Rangers by quitting the club with the Loftus Road outfit embroiled in a relegation battle. Redknapp, joined QPR in November 2012, but he claims he is ending his managerial tenure to undergo knee replacement surgery. Rangers chairman Tony Fernandes accepted the former Tottenham manager's resignation just a day after tweeting there would be 'no more cheque book' as the transfer window slammed shut on Monday. Harry Redknapp has resigned as Queens Park Rangers manager with immediate effect . Redknapp, pictured in his side's defeat at Stoke on Saturday, and right on crutches in 2013 after knee surgery . Redknapp, 67, has left Queens Park Rangers with the club 19th in the Premier League table . QPR are languished in a relegation dogfight . Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey will take temporary charge instead of Glenn Hoddle, who has been working as part of Redknapp's backroom team. Tim Sherwood meanwhile, has been installed as the early favourite to take over at Loftus Road. Redknapp had been under intense pressure for months with QPR languishing in a relegation dogfight, fending off what he claimed was a club insider trying to undermine his position. His side are 19th in the Premier League and have not picked up a single point away from home in their 11 matches this term. The 67-year-old's shock exit comes after a 3-1 defeat at Stoke on Saturday and an abject final day in the transfer window where he missed out on Emmanuel Adebayor, Aaron Lennon. and Matt Jarvis. He cut a forlon figure as the left Loftus Road late on Monday night. Joey Barton and his QPR team-mates reflect on his side's 3-1 defeat at the Britannia Stadium on Saturday . Queens Park Rangers have failed to pick up a single point in their 11 matches away from Lofus Road . He informed chairman Tony Fernandes of his decision at 5.30am on Tuesday morning. 'I have had such a fantastic time at QPR,' said Redknapp. 'I would like to thank the board, the players and all my staff, and especially the supporters who have been absolutely fantastic to me since I arrived at the club for their tremendous support. Redknapp, who spent six weeks on crutches in the summer of 2013 after he underwent surgery to fix a knee cartilage problem, added: 'Sadly I need immediate surgery on my knee which is going to stop me from doing my job in the coming weeks. It means I won’t be able to be out on the training pitch every day, and if I can’t give 100 per-cent I feel it’s better for someone else to take over the reins. 'My relationship with Tony Fernandes has been one of the highlights of my footballing career and I wish the club every success. I am confident they will survive in the Premier League this year.' Sherwood leads the race to replace Redknapp and has been out of work since leaving Tottenham last summer, although he has been in contention for jobs at Crystal Palace and West Bromwich Albion. Ferdinand was appointed head of football operations at the club in October and was soon followed on to the staff by Ramsey in a role on the club's academy. The pair worked together at Tottenham last season as assistants to Sherwood when he took over from Andre Villas-Boas at White Hart Lane. Tim Sherwood, pictured with Les Ferdinand, is the early contender to take over from Harry Redknapp . Sherwood is pictured with Les Ferdinand and Chris Ramsey; the pair have taken temporary charge of the club . Their presence at Loftus Road and Ferdinand’s close relationship with owner Fernandes has fuelled speculation for some time that Redknapp would be ousted in favour of Sherwood. And that the triumvirate from Spurs would soon be back together. Sherwood needed special dispensation from the Premier League to operate as a manager at Spurs because he did not have the UEFA Pro Licence required to do the job. He had to enrol for the first available course and is midway through it with the Football Association of Wales. It will be completed later this year. Redknapp cited his need for a knee replacement operation in the announcement from QPR but he has slowly become infuriated by what he regards as a whispering campaign to force him out. Rangers were chasing a number of targets on deadline day including Emmanuel Adebayor and Aaron Lennon but failed to complete any of them. Redknapp looked dejected as he left Loftus Road at the end of a long day and his resignation was tendered hours later. He took charge of 105 matches at the Loftus Road club winning 36 games, but his win rate in his 48 Premier League matches was only 19 per cent.","Harry Redknapp will undergo knee replacement surgery in coming weeks .

"It's a dog's life that's actually closer to a human's life. Forget doggy shoes and 'hair' salons, the latest must-have for dog owners is a subscription to a special canine TV channel. Filmmakers are calling DogTV a new breed of television - an eight-hour block of on-demand cable TV programming designed to keep your dog relaxed, stimulated and entertained while you are at work. To get the right footage, cameramen got on their knees and shot low and long. 'I shot from the point of view of the dog,' said Gilad Neumann, chief executive officer of DogTV. Unique: Filmmakers are calling DogTV a new breed of television - an eight-hour block of on-demand cable TV programming designed to keep your dog relaxed, stimulated and entertained while you are at work . In production, they had to mute colors, alter sound and add music specially written for dogs. There will be no commercials, no ratings and no reruns, although some might argue that watching a slug crawl is hardly exciting new programming. One million subscribers with two cable companies have access to DogTV in San Diego. It is doing so well that parent company PTV Media plans to offer it nationally in the next several months, Neumann said. It will cost about $4.99 a month, Neumann said. If you figure more than 46 million U.S. households have dogs (according to the American Pet Products Association) and 97 percent of U.S. homes have televisions, the future looks promising. Bleu, a year-old French bulldog, has been watching for a month and snorts and grunts his approval, owner Mary Catania of San Diego said. He used to perk up when Family Guy came on, Catania said, but he seems more intrigued by DogTV. Curious: The dogs will watch footage of things the experience on a day to day basis, such as traffic or other dogs . Stimulating: New technologies like digital TV, high-definition cameras, and enhanced production have changed the way dogs perceive the images, while big screens allow them to see from anywhere in a room . 'I always feel guilty leaving him alone all day when I'm at work,' Catania said. 'He's like my kid. I don't have any children so I really treat him like my child. Anything that makes him happy makes me happy.' For years, pet owners have been leaving a television or radio on when they go out so their pets have company, said Dr. Nick Dodman, director of the Animal Behavior Clinic in Department of Clinical Sciences at Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in Massachusetts. But Dodman said that according to research on the canine brain, with analog television, dogs could only see a flickering screen. New technologies like digital TV, high-definition cameras, and enhanced production have changed the way dogs perceive the images, while big screens allow them to see from anywhere in a room, Neumann said. Do dogs really understand what they're watching? Dodman said research is ongoing, but it appears that dogs not only recognize other dogs on TV, they may even respond differently to their own breed. They definitely recognize sounds, though, whether it's barking or sirens, and audio on DogTV has been tailored accordingly. A dog's best friend: To get the right footage, cameramen got on their knees and shot low and long so that the angles were from a dog's point of view . Technical: Based on dog sleeping pattern studies, programmers alternate footage and soundtracks designed for stimulation, relaxation and exposure throughout the eight hours . Because high frequency sounds can be very irritating to dogs, they've been removed. And music is written and tailored for their hearing, though it sounds like elevator music to humans. What you won't find on DogTV are the sounds that blare on regular TV: no gunshots, no explosions, no heavy metal music, Neumann said. Dogs can see blue and yellow, but not red or green, Neumann said, so colors are altered for DogTV too. Based on dog sleeping pattern studies, programmers alternate footage and soundtracks designed for stimulation, relaxation and exposure throughout the eight hours. Exposure is designed to acquaint dogs with things they will see each day. 'There are studies that show when young puppies are exposed to video images of other dogs, it acts as a form of socialization,' Dodman said. Sights and sounds during this part of the programming expose the animals to things like traffic, babies, other pets and doorbells. Relaxation segments feature sleeping dogs and nature scenes - like the slugs - accompanied by dog lullabies. Stimulation includes dogs running, playing and surfing, animation and a lot of panting. The idea behind this part of DogTV is to get a dog moving, even if it is home alone. Shows are 'refreshed' daily for variety. Fancy that: Dogs can see blue and yellow, but not red or green, so colors are altered for DogTV too . There has been a lot of feedback from viewers saying their cats like the show as well as their dogs, Neumann said. CatTV may be added later, but DogTV is strictly for the dogs, he said. The Escondido Humane Society, on the outskirts of San Diego County, isn't wired for cable yet, but DogTV offered to give them relaxation-only test videos. 'We handle 5,000 animals a year. We get high-energy, big dogs that need to calm down. When we plugged it in, we saw almost immediate results,' said development director Jean Loo-Russo. If an extremely active dog is confined for long periods of time, a chemical imbalance can occur and it can go kennel crazy, Loo-Russo said. You can prevent that with DogTV and 20-minute walks twice a day, she said. Every dog at the shelter can't see a TV, but they are all within hearing distance and that's helping too, Loo-Russo said. Pets may one day be able to sniff DogTV, Dodman said. 'The technology is here to add smell. There are boxes you can buy that have 60 different wells that you can fill with scents. Like fireworks, you can cue them with what's on television.' Too bad they can't control the remote.","'Relaxation' shows include footage of a snail crawling along the ground while the stimulating programmes show dogs cavorting around .
Pooches won't have to put up with repeats or commercial breaks - there aren't any!
Creators hope that one day dogs will be able to sniff DogTV ."
"Manchester City, reeling after being forced to admit they and their sister club in New York misled fans on both sides of the Atlantic over Frank Lampard, are having their financial accounts scrutinised by UEFA to assess whether an attempt has been made to mislead the European governing body over the full extent of the club’s financial losses in 2013-14. The Mail on Sunday can reveal UEFA are examining whether the creation of a set of subsidiary companies by City’s ‘parent’ company, City Football Group (CFG), allowed City to under-report the club’s losses for 2013-14. Two particular subsidiary companies alone had costs, including wages, of £36.7million in the year to the end of May 2014, and posted combined losses of £25.9m in that period. Most of their business was done effectively on behalf of Manchester City FC in that period. Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard . City had wrongly claimed that Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move . CITY FOOTBALL GROUP (CFG) Parent company to Man City, New York City, Melbourne Heart, Yokohama Marinos, Man City Women, City Football Marketing and City Football Services (among others). Turnover to end of May 2014: £347m. Operating expenses: £407m (including wages £228m). Loss: £63m . MAN CITY FC . Turnover to end of May 2014: £346.5m. Operating . expenses: £366m (including wages £205m). Loss: £23m. CITY FOOTBALL MARKETING LTD . Turnover to end of May 2014: £6.4m. Operating expenses: £19.2m (including wages £5.5m). Loss: £12.8m. CITY FOOTBALL SERVICES LTD . Turnover to end of May 2014: £4.5m. Operating expenses: £17.6m (including wages £7.7m). Loss: £13.1m. City’s club accounts for 2013-14, revealed last month, showed City had halved their own losses from a year earlier to post an annual deficit of ‘only’ £23m. But UEFA could judge City’s accounts should more accurately have included more of the subsidiary companies’ losses, in which case City would be in danger of breaching UEFA’s FFP regulations for a second year running. UEFA have confirmed checks are being made ‘of all relevant accounts and related-party activities as part of [the] Financial Fair Play (FFP) investigations’. For breaching FFP rules the first time, City were hit with a £49m fine (two-thirds of it suspended), have a reduced 21-man squad for this season’s Champions League and had a spending limit imposed on summer and January transfer activity. City have strenuously insisted throughout that they have done nothing wrong, their accounts are in order and that they expect to pass all FFP requirements. City sources say they will co-operate fully with any UEFA inquiry. The rule breach last time stemmed from sales of ‘intellectual property’ by City to two companies owned by CFG in deals that UEFA ruled artificially inflated City’s income in 2012-13. When the deals were not allowed, City’s losses without them meant a breach of FFP. Lampard smiles during his press conference after it was announced he would be joining the MLS club . The Mail on Sunday can reveal the same two subsidiaries are involved in the new scrutiny. One is City Football Marketing Limited (CFML), self-described in their own financial accounts as providers of ‘commercial and marketing services to professional sports clubs and organising bodies’. Their main client in 2013-14 was Manchester City FC. Their minor clients were City’s sister clubs in New York and Melbourne. The other relevant subsidiary to UEFA’s probe is City Football Services Limited (CFSL), described in their own accounts as providing ‘scouting services, performance analysis and other sporting advice to professional sports clubs and organising bodies’. Their main client in 2013-14 was Manchester City FC. Their minor client was City’s sister club in New York, NYCFC. Although MCFC in Manchester paid a total £10.1m combined to CFML and CFSL in 2013-14 for ‘services’, the key issue will be how much of the smaller firms’ costs of £36.7m were incurred on MCFC business. One of the quirks of City’s accounts for 2013-14 was that they apparently shed 135 staff in a year but, in fact, most of them simply became employees of the subsidiaries. UEFA will ask City and parent company GFG to clarify details of various company accounts in the group. Certainly there appear to be some errors, inadvertent or not. The former Chelsea man pictured in action during City's Premier League clash with Sunderland . Manuel Pellegrini was reduced to a 21-man squad in the Champions League this season . One example is MCFC reporting a different value for intellectual property sold to CFML, whose own accounts have a slightly smaller value on what they paid MCFC for the same item. Another example is CFG and MCFC’s accounts both saying former midfielder Javi Garcia was sold last summer to Shakhtar Donetsk in Ukraine, whereas in fact he was sold to Zenit St Petersburg in Russia — notwithstanding a strange move that has remained hitherto secret. The most logical explanation for these anomalies and others, City sources say, is simple mistakes, also cited by the club on Friday as the reason for multiple misleading statements on Lampard. City’s various entities were forced into an embarrassing admission that Lampard had never signed for NYCFC, as claimed last summer, when that occasion was used to sell season tickets and shirts; nor that he had ever been on loan at City. Even in ‘clarifying’ the situation, City at first claimed Lampard had had a contract at City only until December. Under pressure from the Premier League, they then confirmed he signed ‘permanently’ last summer on a year’s deal. More worrying for City’s owner Sheik Mansour, it has damaged the credibility of City and NYCFC . The Lampard episode has caused outrage in the US among NYCFC’s fans, many of whom feel duped. More worrying for City’s owner Sheik Mansour, it has damaged the credibility of City and NYCFC — his flagship sports ventures — and called into question the integrity of his whole organisation. There is no specific timeframe to when City might discover whether they are in the clear over the latest accounts. A UEFA spokesman told The Mail on Sunday: ‘Manchester City, like all clubs which have signed settlement agreements [after breaching FFP previously], are subject to ongoing monitoring, and any case of non-compliance with the terms of their agreement will be automatically referred to the Club Financial Control Body (CFCB) Adjudicatory Chamber as per Article 15 (4) of the Procedural Rules governing the CFCB. ‘UEFA undertakes thorough checks of all relevant accounts and related-party activities as part of its Financial Fair Play investigations.’","Manchester City  forced to admit they misled fans over Frank Lampard .

"Charley Hoffman survived a wayward tee-shot on the final hole to win his third PGA Tour title at the OHL Classic at Mayakoba in Mexico. Hoffman finished 17 under par and won by one stroke from Shawn Stefani after New Zealand's Danny Lee, whose seven successive birdies on the front nine was the longest streak of the tour season, faded on the inward half. But the 37-year-old American had to do it the hard way after hitting a tree with his final drive, forcing him to hack out left-handed. Charley Hoffman celebrates after holey his bogey putt on the 18th to win the OHL Classic at Mayakoba . Hoffman is met by his family on the 18th green after three shot turn around in the final round . Two good shots set up a tap-in bogey and his compatriot Stefani could do no better, having left his own tee-shot up against the face of a bunker. Hoffman's win at the El Camaleon course is his third career PGA title and his first victory in four years . Hoffman's five-under-par round of 66 was blemish-free up until that point, with four birdies on the front nine taking him firmly into contention having started three strokes behind overnight leader Jason Bohn. He then pitched to two feet to set up birdie on the par-five 13th and saw a wonderful approach at 15 roll just past the right of the hole and a foot through - bringing him another birdie - and even his struggles down the last could not prevent him clinching the title. Hoffman told pgatour.com: 'I was behind a little bit but I kept hitting good shots and giving myself chances. 'Obviously Danny must have made a couple of bogeys coming down the stretch but I just kept hitting fairways and hitting good irons. 'The 13th was the momentum turner - Shawn's in the fairway and I fan mine out right, but I end up making birdie and he makes bogey.' He had no regrets over not playing safe at the last. He said: 'That's driver all day for me, I've got 290 (yards) to carry to take out the bunker. I just pulled it slightly too much and got real unlucky ending up next to the base of a tree.' A two-under 69 saw Stefani remain in second, where he started the round, while Lee shared third with Andres Gonzales.

The 24-year-old Lee had moved into the lead after his blistering front nine. A solid putt at the sixth earned him his fourth successive birdie and he followed it up with a superb three-wood onto the green at the par-five seventh and well-judged irons to the next two greens. Lee said: 'I'm happy with where I finished. The back nine on this golf course is very tough and you have to hit perfect shots to make birdies, which I didn't do.' Jerry Kelly was fifth on 14 under, Brice Garnett was a further shot back and Bohn joined Tony Finau at 12 under after a closing 74 featuring three bogeys and a double.

"Nestled in a pretty Yorkshire village is an award-winning garden, filled with hanging baskets and rustic planters. It is the last place you would expect to find a feud so bitter it ended up in court – where it was labelled bizarre and disturbing. But the garden’s owner Danuta Cross, 64, has accused her neighbours of stalking her, and has herself been convicted of harassment. The home of Danuta Cross, who admitted to yelling abuse at her neighbours in South Cave, East Yorkshire . Danuta Cross, 64, (pictured right) claims she was bullied by her neighbours as they resent her gardening skills . Cross, who kept a picturesque garden (pictured) was a past winner of the South Cave garden competition . Cross said she was 'extremely upset and shaken' by the feud over her well-kept garden (above) in South Cave . The horticultural hostilities were revealed this week as Cross pleaded guilty to yelling abuse at former civil servants Alexandra Smith, 65, and David Myhill, 59. Their bungalow, with its well-kept garden, sits next door to hers in South Cave, East Yorkshire. Cross claims the couple are bullying her because they resent her gardening abilities. Michael Copeman, defending, told Beverley magistrates’ court: ‘It is a very bizarre case . . . She has made complaints over a long period of time that she was being stalked. 'Whenever she is in her garden, the neighbours come out and stand at the side of the hedge and follow her about.’ He said police had been investigating, but had so far found nothing to back up her claims. ‘This is a woman at the end of her tether. She feels she is being watched all the time,’ he said. Cross, a past winner of the South Cave Gardening Competition, was described as a pillar of the community who raised £800 for the village war memorial fund by hosting a barbecue in her garden. District Judge Fred Rutherford called her outburst ‘somewhat disturbing’ and adjourned sentencing until October 29. Yesterday, Cross said she was ‘extremely upset and shaken’. She added: ‘I’ve had problems with my neighbours and it’s ongoing. It’s been going on a long time now.’ Outside court, she said: ‘It was completely out of character for me. I am stressed and terrified because I have never had to deal with a situation like this . . . I don’t want to be in my own home and I am thinking of moving.’ Last night Mr Myhill said: ‘We don’t wish to comment while there is still an ongoing legal process.’ A local man said: ‘There’s a bit of competition between the two houses, it all got out of hand. It’s a constant battle – everyone wants to have the prettier garden and I think there’s a bit of rivalry or jealousy.’ David Myhill, who lives in Little Wold Cottage, pictured, said he did not want to comment during the legal case .","Danuta Cross of  East Yorkshire pleaded guilty to harassing her neighbours .

Now, restaurant owner Nick Gambardella is asking customers to sign a legal disclaimer that prevents them from suing him if they fall victim to the red-hot burger. Developed by American pharmacist Wilbuer Scoville in 1912, the Scoville scale is a measure of the amount of capsaicin in chilli peppers. It can also be used to measure the 'hotness' of anything derived from chilli peppers, such as spicy sauces. Capsaicin is the chemical compound that produces the sensation of heat in the mouth. The amount present is measured in Scoville Heat Units - with the average chilli pepper measuring 500 units. The document reads: 'I the undersigned accept all responsibility for any effects incured (sic) due to the consumtion (sic) of the above mentioned XXX Hot Chilli Burger and release Burger Off, its owner and staff from any liability.'

"Liberia, the hardest hit by the Ebola epidemic ravaging west Africa, should brace for thousands of new cases in coming weeks, the World Health Organisation (WHO) warned today. 'Many thousands of new cases are expected in Liberia over the coming three weeks,' the UN health agency said in a statement. The death toll from the deadliest Ebola epidemic the world has ever seen, which is spreading across west Africa, with Liberia, Guinea, Sierra Leone the worst hit, has topped 2,000, out of nearly 4,000 people infected. Scroll down for video . A Liberian health worker speaks with families in a classroom now used as Ebola isolation ward  in Monrovia . Liberians react as their neighbour is transported by Red Cross health workers after dying of the Ebola virus in Banjor on the outskirts of Monrovia . Liberia already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths, and 'the number of new cases is increasing exponentially,' the WHO warned. Key development partners trying to help Liberia respond to the outbreak 'need to prepare to scale up their current efforts by three- to four-fold,' it added. The countries hardest hit by the epidemic are among the world's poorest, with dilapidated medical infrastructures that have all but buckled under the strain of trying to contain the virus. Before the outbreak, Liberia for instance had one doctor to treat every 100,000 patients in a total population of some 4.4 million people. Now that 152 healthcare workers in the country have been infected and 79 have died, the WHO said the ratio had worsened significantly. 'Every infection or death of a doctor or nurse depletes response capacity significantly,' it said. The UN body described how taxis filled with entire families, including members suspected of having Ebola, criss-crossed Monrovia 'searching for a treatment bed'. 'There are none. As WHO staff in Liberia confirm, no free beds for Ebola treatment exist anywhere in the country.' Liberia already accounts for about half of all cases and deaths, and 'the number of new cases is increasing exponentially,' the WHO warned . When Ebola patients are turned away from treatment centres, 'they have no choice but to return to their communities and homes, where they inevitably infect others, perpetuating constantly higher flare-ups in the number of cases,' it said. Taxis and motorbike taxis have become a prime source for possible Ebola transmission, since the vehicles are not disinfected between passengers, if ever, according to the WHO. 'The number of new cases is moving far faster than the capacity to manage them in Ebola-specific treatment centres,' it said. How west Africa is being affected by cases of Ebola, centring on Sierra Leone and Liberia . Fourteen of Liberia's 15 counties have now reported confirmed cases of the tropical virus, which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids. In Montserrado county alone, which includes Monrovia, the agency said 1,000 beds were urgently needed to treat Ebola patients. Only 240 are currently available in that county, while 260 are being planned, said the WHO. The agency estimates that between 200 and 250 medical staff are needed to safely manage an Ebola treatment facility with just 70 beds. UK to set up Ebola treatment centre . British military personnel and aid experts will set up a treatment centre for the deadly Ebola virus in Sierra Leone, the Government has announced. The 62-bed facility will be based near the capital Freetown. The UK's support follows a direct request from the World Health Organisation and the government of Sierra Leone for assistance in containing the outbreak. The initial phase of the treatment centre will be up and running within eight weeks, the Department for International Development (DfID) said. The centre will comprise a 50-bed facility for treating victims of the disease, with a 12-bed unit to provide specialist care for local and international health workers. Military experts will begin to survey and assess the site later this week and the Government is working with Save the Children to design a long-term plan to manage and operate the facility after it has been fully set up. Military experts will begin to survey and assess the site later this week and the Government is working with Save the Children to design a long-term plan to manage and operate the facility after it has been fully set up . International Development Secretary Justine Greening said: 'Britain is at the forefront of the global effort to tackle this deadly outbreak, having already committed £25 million of support, including frontline treatment and funding for medical research to develop a vaccine. 'The scale of the problem requires the entire international community to do more to assist the affected countries, which is why the UK is working with the government of Sierra Leone to build a new medical treatment facility near their capital Freetown. 'When it is up and running, it will enable the UK to provide medical care for local and international health workers, as well as treatment for the wider population.' Save the Children chief executive Justin Forsyth said: 'Ebola threatens thousands of people's lives across West Africa and could set back development many decades. 'The key to combating this epidemic is backing front-line health workers and underpinning a fractured health system in Sierra Leone - without urgent action to assist medics, many more children and their families will suffer and die from this most appalling and tragic disease. 'Save the Children is working alongside DfID and the Ministry of Defence on a feasibility study to cement plans to firstly help set up the centre and then take it over with international experts, as well as local staff, to provide the very best life-saving health service under the most challenging conditions.' Armed Forces Minister Mark Francois said establishing the centre would present the military with a 'unique set of challenges'. He said: 'The people of West Africa need our help and we will not stand idly by. The UK has been at the forefront of responding to the epidemic and our military will continue the great work so far. British nurse William Pooley contracted the virus in Sierra Leone.The 29-year-old survived after being airlifted back to the UK for specialist treatment at the Royal Free Hospital in London . 'This operation will involve a unique set of challenges but I believe that we have the ability to provide support to the World Health Organisation in helping to bring the outbreak under control.' DfID was unable to provide any figures for the cost of the centre until it is established, but it will be in addition to the £25 million of aid already committed to the Ebola crisis. The dangers faced by international humanitarian workers in countries affected by the Ebola outbreak were illustrated when British nurse William Pooley contracted the virus in Sierra Leone.

"Not long after full-time on Sunday and David de Gea has already posted photographs of his stellar performance against Everton on his Instagram page. By this morning, they had been viewed and 'liked' by almost 70,000 people. Pretty much one for every United fan inside Old Trafford on Sunday, the ripples of De Gea's efforts nevertheless spread much further than the boundaries of Stretford, Manchester. This was perhaps that day when De Gea confirmed his arrival as one of the best goalkeepers in the world. It has been some journey, too. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David de Gea enjoying training with United team-mates . Man United's David de Gea confirmed his arrival as one of the best goalkeepers in the world  on Sunday . The goalkeeper posted images of his stellar performance to Instagram with 70,000 people 'liking' them . De Gea made a string of brilliant saves, including this effort to deny Bryan Oviedo in the dying stages . Spaniard De Gea saved Leighton Baines' penalty as Manchester United defeated Everton at Old Trafford . De Gea marks his penalty save with a salute to preseve United's 1-0 lead thanks to Angel di Maria . De Gea spoke in recent days of his work with new United goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek. 'He is one of the best coaches I have ever seen,' said De Gea. 'It's a new system. He knows everything about positioning and what I should do with my feet.' Three years ago, however, the work United were trying to get in to their new arrival from Atletico Madrid was different, certainly more basic. 'His first six months were horrendous,' said De Gea's former goalkeeping coach Eric Steele in an interview with the United We Stand fanzine. 'We worked with him on and off the field to make him more powerful. We changed his lifestyle. De Gea has described Man United's goalkeeping coach Frans Hoek (left) as one of the best he's worked with . United's former goalkeeper coach Eric Steele revealed the club made  changes to make De Gea more powerful . 'He would finish training and want to go home. When I told him to come back in the afternoon he'd ask, ""Why?"" 'There were lifestyle issues. He'd sleep two or three times a day. He'd have his main meal late at night. We pushed protein drinks on him straight after training. 'We physically made him drink. We had him in the gym a lot. He hated it. They don't do the gym in Spain as much. We needed to build his core strength. De Gea, pictured with Sir Alex Ferguson upon signing, endured a 'horrendous' first six months at the club . The Spanish stopper was forced to make a number of lifestyle changes after joining Man United in 2011 . 'But he has calmness, composure and inner strength. Nothing fazes him. 'Playing in front of 76,000? No problem. Very few possess that.' De Gea's official stats reveal  that he weighs 76kilos, just short of 12 stone. That's five kilos (or ten pounds) heavier than when he arrived for almost £18m in the summer of 2011. The improvement is testimony to time spent in the gym, time spent changing his body from one that Sportsmail's Jamie Redknapp famously said needed 'to grow in to his clothes' to the purpose-built Barclays Premier League physique we see today. De Gea is now five kilos heavier than when he first arrived in Manchester from Atletico Madrid for £18million . 'I do not think people appreciate just how hard it was for me coming to a new country at that age and a different type of football,' said De Gea in one interview. 'I knew I had to become bigger physically. You can see now I look different to when I first came here. I have much more muscle. 'In training the players would deliberately hit high balls into me and barge into me so I would get used to that side of the English game. 'I actually enjoy the physical side of it all now. 'Eric Steele was a great goalkeeping coach who always looked after me and I will remember that.' De Gea's improvement at United has been steady. Peculiarly he still has only two Spanish caps, a fact reflective of the enduring talents of Real Madrid's Iker Casillas. Nevertheless the arrival of Ander Herrera at Old Trafford this summer means that the triumvirate of Herrara, De Gea and Juan Mata is back in harness not too many years since the three friends combined to help Spain win the Under 19 European Championship. 'David is one of the most skilled goalkeepers I've ever seen,' said Mata after De Gea played his 100th United game earlier this season. United team-mates would hit high balls into De Gea's path and purposely barge into him to improve his game . One of the few players to actually improve during the difficult United tenure of David Moyes - due largely to the work of the Scot's goalkeeping coach Chris Woods - De Gea is now attempting to improve still further under the rather forensic guidance of Dutch coach Hoek. The man credited in Holland with the ingenious way Louis van Gaal used his goalkeepers during the World Cup, Hoek has worked largely on De Gea's positioning and distribution, sending the 23-year-old home at night with videos not only of his own performances but also those of other Premier League goalkeepers. Manchester United midfielder Juan Mata congratulates his compatriot following Sunday's win over Everton . 'I watch the images of the games and we speak about that,' De Gea told MUTV. 'It's important and I watch all the other goalkeepers at home. 'Sunday was one of the best games of my career for Manchester United and I'm really happy with the saves, the win and for the team as well. 'It's difficult to say something about the crowd. When they sing your name like this, it is unbelievable. 'I watched his [Leighton Baines] penalties before the game and I saved it. 'But you have to be lucky sometimes.' VIDEO De Gea was man on the match - Martinez . De Gea dives to his right to deny Baines - the Everton left back had converted his previous 14 penalties . The Red Devils goalkeeper revealed he had watched Baines' previous spot-kicks before the clash . Seemingly settled now in the Cheshire enclave of Altrincham, De Gea no longer lives with his parents here. Steele and former United manager Sir Alex Ferguson encouraged him to be more independent, feeling it would help him grow on and off the field. Now fully able to converse in English - something he wasn't confident of doing as recently as 2013's summer tour of Australia and the Far East - De Gea has banished the homesickness that also blighted his early days in the North West. Like all southern European players, De Gea thinks of home and future opportunities there. Why wouldn't he? For now, though, he has other ambitions. De Gea, pictured with his girlfriend Edurne, is now seemingly settled in the Cheshire enclave of Altrincham . 'When Edwin van der Sar said he was leaving Manchester United I wanted to be the man to replace him,' he said. 'I was given that chance and I am not going to let it go. 'I would love if one day the fans speak of me in the same way they speak of Edwin and Peter Schmeichel. 'That would mean all the hard work has paid off.' Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"Early man: A third of people in modern Europe show genetic traces of populations from sub-Saharan Africa, leading researchers to conclude that people migrated between the continents as early as 11,000 years ago . People moved between Africa and Europe long before recorded history - and the migrations might have been driven by Europeans moving south to 'weather' ice ages. The genetic traces of long-forgotten migrations from Africa to Europe live on in Europeans today. A third of the genetic traces of sub-Saharan lineages in today's Europe come from prehistory. Researchers think that Europeans 'pushed south' by glaciers might have met with populations from sub-Saharan Africa. People moved between the continents as early as 11,000 years ago. Geneticists used mitochondrial DNA to look for the traces of ancient migrations. Mitochondrial DNA is passed directly from mother to child with no DNA from the father - and tiny changes in the sequence come to 'characterise' different populations, which can be used to trace movements and migrations of groups of humans in the past. Large numbers of people moved between . Africa and Europe during recent and well-documented time periods such as . the Roman Empire, the Arab conquest, and the slave trade - but the researchers found that a third of sub-Saharan lineages came from before these movements. 'It was very surprising to find that more than 35 percent of the sub-Saharan lineages in Europe arrived during a period that ranged from more than 11,000 years ago to the Roman Empire times,' said Dr. Antonio Salas of the University of Santiago de Compostela and senior author of the study. 'The other 65% of European haplogroup L lineages arrived in more recent times.' The authors explain that these contacts likely connected sub-Saharan Africa to Europe not only via North Africa, but also directly by coastal routes. Salas said that it still remains unknown why there was genetic flow between the Africa and Europe in prehistoric times. One possible scenario is that some bidirectional flow was promoted when the last glaciation pushed some Europeans southward, until the glacier receded and populations returned north. In addition to tracing the genetic links of Africa and Europe back to prehistoric times, Salas expects that their work will also help those individuals who want to learn more about their own ancestry.","People migrated between 11,000 years ago and start of Roman Empire .

"The Americans lived up to the hype and then some, winning their first Olympic gold medal in women's gymnastics since 1996. Not only did Americans Alexandra Raisman, Gabrielle Douglas, Jordyn Wieber, McKayla . Maroney and Kyla Ross win, but they won big. Their score of 183.596 Tuesday night was a whopping five points ahead of Russia. Scroll down for video .

Romania won the bronze medal. Some teenagers might find that pressure tough to bear, but the Americans reveled in it. 'We knew we could do it. We just had to pull out all the stops,' said Miss Raisman, the team captain. Miss Maroney added: 'There were a lot of rumors that we couldn't do this because we won worlds, and there were a lot of doubts,' We went out there to prove something and that's what we did.' When they saw the Russians and Romanians peeking in the doorway during training sessions, they would add some extra zest to their routines, the better to intimidate the competition.

If . you can do that, everything's going to be OK.' And when the gold was on the line, the Americans were simply spectacular. Coach John Geddert, who is also Miss Wieber's personal coach, went a step farther. He said: 'This is the best team all-time. Others . might disagree. The '96 team might disagree. But this is the best team. Difficulty-wise, consistency wise, this is USA's finest.' The team essentially won the gold medal with their first event, vault, putting on a fireworks show right in front of the Russians. All of the Americans do Amanars, one of . the toughest vaults in the world - a roundoff onto the takeoff board, . back handspring onto the table and 2.5 twisting somersaults before . landing. It's got a start value - the measure of difficulty - of 6.5, a whopping 0.7 above the vault most other gymnasts do, and they ripped off one massive one after another. World champion Jordyn Wieber went first and did perhaps the best one she's ever done, getting great height in the air with her legs locked together. When her feet slammed into the mat on landing, she threw up her arms and smiled broadly. Miss Wieber's triumph followed a crushing disappointment on Sunday, when she missed a shot at Olympic gold due to international rules that allow only two competitors per country in the finals.

Triumph: Muhammed Karim, managing director and executive chef at the restaurant, presents Dr Rothwell with his certificate. He said 300 people have attempted the Widower and failed with 'people crying, sweating, shaking and vomiting' It took him more than an hour to eat . the curry dish, which he washed down with mouthfuls of cobra beer and a . small amount of rice. 'I trained as a doctor in Leeds and . later as a radiologist in Manchester, so as a student I got used to . eating curries as they were cheap,' he said. 'This curry got hotter and hotter as I went on and it was a struggle to finish, but I was determined to succeed. 'The owner offered me a glass of milk to help with the hotness, but I decided to stick with beer and I think that helped. 'I had to take a short break and go . for a walk as I felt really sweaty and the owner said I was . hallucinating, but I think it was just the endorphins from all the . chillis.' His daughter Alice, 23, said they all tried the curry but could only manage half a teaspoon. 'I knew it was hot when dad admitted . it was rather hot as he never does that,' she said. 'But he seemed to . manage it without many problems. We were all clutching our stomachs . after just half a teaspoon, it blew my head off.' Muhammed Karim, managing director and . executive chef at the restaurant said: 'It took Mr Rothwell just over . an hour to eat The Widower - but that included a 10 minute walk down . Grantham High Street when he started hallucinating. 'More than 300 people have tackled The Widower before - including about 10 women - but no one has ever been able to finish one. 'Most manage about seven mouthfuls before they give up. 'We've had people sweating, crying, shaking and vomiting. 'We even had to ring an ambulance once.' Hell's kitchen: Dr Rothwell took on the challenge at Bindi restaurant in Grantham, Lincolnshire . Fiery dish: The dish contained 20 Naga chillies, which is the second hottest chilli in the world at over six million Scovilles after the Trinidad Moruga Scorpion . Mr Karim said Dr Rothwell, who is a regular curry eater from Sudbrooke, excelled at the culinary challenge. He . added: 'Apart from spotting a few tears in his eyes, and the short . period of hallucinating, he was cool and collected and seemed to cope . very well. 'I have tried The Widower and it really is a killer. 'Even making it is a painful experience - despite wearing goggles and a protective face mask.

"George Zimmerman has said he 'absolutely' believes that he is a victim of the fallout following his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin on February 26, 2012, in Sanford, Florida. In his second TV interview in a matter of days, Zimmerman also compared himself to ‘all our fallen soldiers’ as he claimed his trail for second-degree murder and manslaughter had been unjust and the result of political pressure. ‘I feel the people in power, like [Florida] Gov. Scott, cowered to political pressure and shredded the Constitution, and spit in the face of all our fallen soldiers, and went through with a malicious prosecution, simply for political pressure,’ said Zimmerman. Scroll down for video . In his second TV interview in two days, George Zimmerman has said he 'absolutely' believes that he is a victim of the fallout following his fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin in 2012 . The interview, conducted with Fusion TV's Derrick Ashong, will air in its entirety on Tuesday evening and in it Zimmerman protests that he has never been racist and that he is living ‘the most Christlike that I can.’ He also told Ashong that he had nothing to say to Trayvon Martin’s parents ‘because of the ongoing civil rights violation investigation by the Department of Justice, I wouldn't say anything to them.’ As well as denying being a racist, Zimmerman claimed he didn’t understand why people are so animated about the racial component of his case. When asked if the races involved in his case had been reversed, he said he believed that the outcome of the trail would have been identical. The interview, conducted with Fusion TV's Derrick Ashong, Zimmerman protests that he is living 'the most Christlike that I can' Zimmerman also spoke about his attempts to sell paintings as a means of supporting himself and he was forced to deny that he was profiting off the tragic loss of another person's life. ‘I try to move on with my life and just live the most Christlike that I can,' he said. 'I'm $2.5 million in debt, so I have to do something to earn a living and keep a roof over my head,’ he said. Ashong also asked Zimmerman if he ever thought he might be able to have anything resembling a normal life. ‘I hate to sound jaded by what's happened, but in all sincerity I plan for the worst and hope for the best,’ said Zimmerman. ‘Whatever it is, I hope that God loves me and uses me for whatever he has planned.’ On the same day that that interview is being televised, it has been reported that Zimmerman has been forced to flee Miami after being chased by a crowd and that there is a $10,000 bounty on his head. Video: George Zimmerman opens up . Scapegoat: George Zimmerman, pictured Monday, has accused President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of making him a 'scapegoat' Zimmerman, 30, was apparently forced to abandon his home with his family in the aftermath of a televised interview on CNN on Monday morning. Infuriated protesters ambushed him, his girlfriend and her son on the beach. In his CNN interview, Zimmerman accused President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder of making him a 'scapegoat'. Speaking on CNN's Chris Cuomo, Zimmerman revealed he still receives death threats seven months after he was acquitted of the murder of Trayvon Martin. He said he suffered a . 'miscarriage of justice' in his trial for the killing of the Florida teen, and maintains that he acted in self-defense within the law. When Cuomo asked him what he was being made a scapegoat for, he . responded: 'The government, the president, the attorney general. 'I don’t know what they're thinking . or why they're thinking it, all I know is that they're doing it. I don't . know what agenda they have.' Law school: Zimmerman, 30, also told Chris Cuomo, left, that he wants to go back to school and get a law degree so he said he can make sure no one else goes through what he did . Zimmerman, . 30, also told Cuomo he wants to go back to school and get a law degree . so he said he can make sure no one else goes through what he did. 'I would like to professionally continue my education and hopefully become an attorney,' Zimmerman said. 'I . think that's the best way to stop the miscarriage of justice that . happened to me from happening to somebody else. I don't think it should . happen to anyone ever again, not one person.' Zimmerman, who has remained a fixture . in news headlines, said he still gets death threats following his . intensely controversial acquittal in the Martin case. 'I . have a lot of people saying that, you know, they guarantee that they're . going to kill me and I'll never be a free man,' he told Cuomo. 'I . realize that they don't know me. They know who I was portrayed to be.' He . also said he's often accused of being racist, but said he was raised by . Peruvian family members and that some of his family are black. 'Sad. Very sad': How George Zimmerman described himself in the recent interview with Ilia Calderón . He said he'd never stop trying to fight the accusation that he's 'the guy who gets away with killing a black kid.' 'If . it takes one person a day at a time to help them realize that's not . what this case was about then that's what I'll do,' Zimmerman said. The comments come just days after he claimed he is suffering from post-traumatic stress and is homeless after his trial. Zimmerman made the claims to . journalist Ilia Calderón, who interviewed him for the Spanish language . current affairs show Aqui y Ahora that aired on Univision on Sunday at . 7pm. During the . interview, Zimmerman also claimed that Martin threatened to kill him . before he shot and killed the unarmed 17-year-old. 'When . he saw my handgun and looked at it and told me that he was going to . kill me that night, uh, that was enough of a threat after the way he had . attacked me. So, I felt his hand going for my weapon,' Zimmerman said. Insight: Zimmerman told Calderón that he receives death threats due to bad media coverage, not the fact that he shot Trayvon Martin . When asked how he feels now, Zimmerman responded 'Sad. Very sad.' He told Calderón that after shooting Martin, his main concern was that he had missed his target. 'I was afraid it had gone through his clothes and that it was going to go... get lost, and, um, you know, go into a house and - because the young man was still talking to me, as I have said. So I thought that it hadn't... affected him, and I got worried, and I said, ""I hope that it hasn't - that the bullet hasn't hit a neighbor,""' Zimmerman said. The much-maligned former insurance . salesman who has recently taken to selling his unique art on eBay said . he was '100 per cent' sure of his actions that night, and that had he . not shot Martin, the teen would have killed him. Zimmerman . said that he has had death threats since the trial, which he put down . to his portrayal in the media and not his shooting of a teenaged boy. Zimmerman told Calderón that he can no longer lead a normal life and must wear a bullet-proof vest when he is out in public. Describing himself as 'totally homeless,' Zimmerman said his family helps him 'a lot.'

"A New York tattoo artist has died after he attempted to surf an elevator, according to reports. Tito Morales, 20, was unconscious when he was found wedged between the elevator car and the wall of the shaft at an apartment block in the Longwood neighborhood of the Bronx on Monday morning. Police told the New York Post that the man, who was heading to pick up some cigarettes after visiting his girlfriend in the building, might have been riding on top of the elevator to 'surf' it when something went wrong. Killed: Tito Morales, 20, was found wedged between an elevator car and the wall of the elevator shart in an apartment block in the Bronx in the early hours of Monday. He was pronounced dead at the scene . Morales tried to jump from the top of one elevator to another when he misjudged the distance and became stuck between the 18th and 19th floors, sources told Sky News. Emergency services were called to the grisly scene around 4am on Monday. They managed to pull Morales out from the shaft but he was pronounced dead at the scene. The Medical Examiner will determine cause of the death and investigators are still trying to determine exactly how he entered the shaft. Other residents told the Post that the elevator was unreliable and often became stuck. About 30 people gathered to see the body being taken out of at the Adams Houses as friends and family hugged each other and sobbed, the New York Daily News reported. One woman was screaming, 'Mi niño! Mi niño!' ('My child! My child!') as others tried to calm her. Evangelita Presinal, 22, said she had . just visited Morales' girlfriend, Joann Sanchez, who lives with her two . children in the building. Humble: Morales, who loved tattooing, had just been visiting his girlfriend in the block when he was killed on Monday morning.

"In 1905 a devastating typhoon swept over the Nadikdik atoll in the middle of the Pacific ocean, killing the majority of inhabitants and washing away most of the island. Just two people survived the storm, but just over a century on, the islands have ‘grown back’ from a sandy deposit to lush reef islands. Now, researchers from New Zealand have studied the reformation of the atoll, which is part of the remote Marshall Islands, to show how islands can form in relatively short periods of time. In 1905 a devastating typhoon swept over the Nadikdik Atoll in the middle of the Pacific ocean, killing the majority of inhabitants and washing away most of the island, but since then, the island has regenerated (pictured) Nadikdik atoll - otherwise known as Knox atoll - is an uninhabited coral atoll of 18 islands in the Pacific Ocean. It is the southernmost atoll of the Ratak Chain of the Marshall Islands. The total land area is only 0.38square miles (98sq km) but it encloses a largely sand-filled lagoon with an area of 1.32 square miles (3.42 sq km). The Knox atoll was claimed by the Empire of Germany along with the rest of the Marshall Islands in 1884. After World War I, the island came under the South Pacific Mandate of the Empire of Japan. Following the end of World War II, it came under the control of the United States until the independence of the Marshall Islands in 1986. On 30 June 1905 the atoll of Nadikdik was completely washed over by a huge typhoon that stripped the atoll down to the bare coral. All of the some 60 inhabitants perished, save two boys who survived a 24-hour drift voyage clinging to a breadfruit tree. A University of Auckland study published in the journal Geomorphology documented the changes that have occurred in the Nadikdik atoll, also known as the Knox atoll, since the terrible typhoon, where large sections of reef were decimated. Dr Murray Ford and Professor Paul Kench studied aerial images of the islands from 1945 up until 2010 and found that a new island has grown from remains, The New Zealand Herald reported. In just over 60 years the island has grown lush vegetation and by studying the aerial photographs they found that patches of vegetation on the once barren landmass have grown by almost 25 per cent, the NZCity website reported. The Nadikidik atoll has grown up from a ruined deposit of sandy and coral into a collection of islands including a fully vegetated and stable landmass as well another larger island composed of once separates smaller islands. Researchers at the University of Auckland studied aerial images (pictured) of the islands from 1945 up until 2010 and found that a new island has grown from decimated remains . The researchers think this rapid regeneration was made possible because the sea around the sandy deposits was so healthy. ‘The storm obviously generated huge amounts of sediment and threw up large amounts of coral on to the islands, which has helped them to re-organise themselves,’ the scientists said. Nadikdik Atoll (pictured) - otherwise known as Knox Atoll - is an uninhabited coral atoll of 18 islands in the Pacific Ocean . ‘They change, they move, they shift - you'll have a period of erosion on one part and a period of accretion on the other.’ Dr Ford, who lived in the Marshall Islands for three years, said the changes were rapid and indicate that reef island formation can occur quickly. ‘Evidence suggests that despite the typhoon occurring over a century ago the geomorphic adjustment of islands is still on-going,’ he said. In just over 60 years the island has grown lush vegetation and by studying the aerial photographs they found that patches of greenery on the once barren islands have grown by almost 25 per cent. Similar vegetation on the island of Ailuk atoll in the Marshall Islands is pictured . ‘The take-home message is really that a high magnitude event can both destroy the islands, and set about a series of processes that enables them to return.’ They hope the study of the small island will help scientists better understand how new islands are created, which is of particular interest as many people are worried that small islands will disappear under rising sea levels, triggered by global warming. Sea levels in the Pacific Ocean near the Marshall Islands are thought to have risen at a rate of 2.2mm a year since 1946. Studying small islands will help scientists better understand how new islands are created, which is of particular interest as many people are worried that small islands will disappear under rising sea levels, triggered by global warming.

"Britain’s spy agencies have been ordered to break up the ‘dark web’ used by paedophiles to share sick child abuse images online. Prime Minister David Cameron said he wanted GCHQ to do more to find those trying to ‘hide from justice’ by using encrypted internet networks. It comes ahead of a Downing Street summit where web firm Google  will pledge to block internet search results linked to child abuse around the world. Summit: David Cameron today held talks in Downing Street with members of leading search engines, internet service providers, the National Crime Agency and the NSPCC . Mr Cameron has made clear that he . wants more to be done to protect internet users from vile images online . while trying to catch those responsible for the abuse. He . has tasked GCHQ intelligence experts to try to track those using secret . links – known as the ‘dark web’ - to share photographs of child abuse. The . National Crime Agency estimates that the number of people in the UK . using encrypted networks has risen by two-thirds and is expected to hit . 20,000-a-day by the end of this year. Some . people could be using them legally, but police and intelligence . agencies believe paedophiles use such networks to distribute child abuse . material. Mr Cameron said: . ‘There has been a lot in the news recently about the techniques, . ability, and brilliance of the people involved in the intelligence . community and GCHQ and the NSA in America. 'That expertise . is going to be brought to bear to go after on these revolting people . sharing these images on the dark net and making them available more . widely,' he told BBC Radio 2's Jeremy Vine show. Britain's . National Crime Agency is joining forces with America's FBI in a new . transatlantic taskforce to target paedophiles who use encrypted networks . online. Michel Van Der Bel, managing director of . Microsoft UK, (left) and Google boss Peter Barron were in Downing Street . for the summit on internet safety today . Also attending the summit with David Cameron were Gavin Patterson from BT and Dido Harding from Talk Talk . Mr Cameron added: 'This is a day when . we can make some real progress against the absolute evil of child abuse . and what happens on the internet. 'The . next stage is now to go after the dark net where people are sharing . images peer to peer away from the Googles and the Microsofts. 'Again . there is a lot more we can do, working with the industry, making sure . we have got law enforcement which have got all the modern technological . tools at their disposal and we will go after these people and arrest . them and bang them up as well. 'The . point is that you use technology which is able to get into the dark . internet, which is able decrypt encrypted files and that is able to find . out what is going on. 'Like . all these things, if you put in the resources and the effort, if you . use the best brains, the brains that are, as it were, the inheritors to . the people that decrypted the enigma code in the Second World War, if . you take those brains and apply it to the problem of tackling child . abuse online you will get results.' Spy post: Intelligence officers at Cheltenham-based GCHQ will work with their US counterparts to break up the dark web . Anyone using internet technology leaves some form of ‘digital footprints’ which GCHQ will try to link to individuals. This intelligence will be used by the National Crime Agency to track and arrest offenders. Several paedophiles have already been arrested as a result of the initiative. The . move comes four months after Mr Cameron demanded tougher action to end . the spread of child abuse images online and to protect children from . seeing pornography on the internet. Dark web: The number of people in the UK using encrypted web networks every day is expected to hit 20,000 this year . The involvement of GCHQ action will also see the National Crime Agency join America's FBI in a new transatlantic taskforce to target paedophiles who use encrypted networks online. No 10 said that the UK-US taskforce is being established by the US assistant attorney general and the British to target criminals who use the internet to hide from the law. It will bring together the newly formed National Crime Agency and its American counterpart, the FBI, as well as other US law enforcement agencies. A Downing Street spokesman said: ‘Child abuse online is not restricted by international borders and so neither must our response. ‘Parents on both sides of the Atlantic rightly expect us to take action on this and that is why we have reached out to secure a much closer working relationship with our American partners. ‘This agreement will only strengthen our ability to crack down on this type of sickening crime.’ At the same time a group of industry experts is being set up to look at new technical solutions for removing child abuse material from the internet. Joanna Shields, the chief executive of Tech City UK, said it would be looking to spot the ‘threats of future’ to protect the most vulnerable in society. ‘It's vital that governments and industry work together to eradicate child abuse content from the internet, and that we mobilise the best and brightest in the technology industry to come up with innovative solutions to tackling this problem,’ she said.","Cameron demands intelligence agencies target secret networks .

"A mother is fighting for the removal of a police caution she was given eight years ago after leaving her six-year-old son home alone for 45 minutes. Parents risk being branded criminals if they leave their children home alone because the law on neglect is not clear, it was warned today. The government is being urged to issue guidance on the age at which youngsters can be trusted on their own, and for how long. There is nothing in the law about when children can be left home alone, only a warning that they must not be put at risk . At present the law does not state an age when a parent can leave a child on their own. It is, however, an offence for a child to be put at risk by not being supervised. The Department for Education directs parents to the NSPCC for information. However, Lib Dem MP John Hemming is calling for the government to be clearer about the circumstances in which parents could be cautioned or prosecuted by police. 'It is not at all clear for how long and at what age children can be left alone,' he told The Sunday Times. 'Nor is it clear whether leaving them alone is either not an issue, a child-protection issue or a criminal issue. 'I sent my daughter, then aged 10, on the train from Birmingham to stay with my mother in Devon. There were no changes and she was met at the other end. Was that acceptable?' He went on: 'I find it odd that whereas it is lawful to send the child to the park and leave them there, it is not lawful to leave them home alone. 'My main concern in all this is clarity. The law should always be clear. We need a debate about what the rules should be.' MP John Hemming is calling for the government to be clearer about laws on parents leaving children at home . The law doesn’t say an age when you can leave a child on their own, but it’s an offence to leave a child alone if it places them at risk. Use your judgement on how mature your child is before you decide to leave them alone. The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) says: . Parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised ‘in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health’. It follows the case of a women called Joan who eight years ago left he son, aged six at the time, while she had a driving lesson – her last before her driving test. 'We went to the school but it was closed. There was no one home to look after him. He was in no danger when I left him,' she told the newspaper. She returned to find the police on her doorstep after a nurse called at the house and the boy answered the door. Joan went to her local police station and was given a caution, which has since meant she struggled to pursue her chosen career as a mental health nurse. She is now trying to have the caution removed. She added: 'I applied to five universities to study and four did not accept me because of this caution,' she said. 'I am now trying to get this removed. My son is 14, at school and absolutely fine.' A spokesman for the Department for Education said 'The law is clear that parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health. It is vital children be kept safe.' A page on the gov.uk website states: 'The law doesn't say an age when you can leave a child on their own, but it's an offence to leave a child alone if it places them at risk. 'Use your judgement on how mature your child is before you decide to leave them alone. 'The National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) says: . · children under 12 are rarely mature enough to be left alone for a long period of time . · children under 16 shouldn't be left alone overnight . · babies, toddlers and very young children should never be left alone . 'Parents can be prosecuted if they leave a child unsupervised 'in a manner likely to cause unnecessary suffering or injury to health'.' An NSPCC spokesman said: 'It is vital we have a common sense approach ... because [parents] are best placed to know what is right for their child.' But the Coram Children's Legal Centre, a national charity that promotes children's rights, insisted that 'most children under 13 would not be able to cope with an emergency'.","Ministers urged to issue guidance on the age when children can be trusted .

"It was a day of returns for Arsenal as they stormed to a 3-0 victory over Stoke on Sunday. Olivier Giroud returned to the first-team after a three-game suspension and Mesut Ozil and Aaron Ramsey were back on the Arsenal bench after lengthy injuries. And in the stands at the Emirates, were two former Arsenal legends. Former Arsenal striker Thierry Henry and winger Robert Pires watch on as their old team beat Stoke 3-0 . Henry scored 228 goals in 376 games in all competitions for Arsenal over two spells at the club . Both Henry and Pires were part of Arsenal's 'Invincibles' team that won the Premier League unbeaten in 2004 . Thierry Henry and Robert Pires were all smiles as they watched Arsene Wenger's side put in a clinical performance against Stoke. The pair later visited the Arsenal dressing room, with Henry posing for a picture with David Ospina - who made his first Premier League start in place of the dropped Wojciech Szczesny. Pires, meanwhile, posed for a picture with his son and Arsenal's star performer Alexis Sanchez.

Midfielder Mesut Ozil made his first appearance for the club since damaging knee ligaments during the defeat to Chelsea on October 5. Aaron Ramsey was included in the match day squad, but did not make it off the bench. Meanwhile, goalkeeper David Ospina, in for the deposed Wojciech Szczesny, made his first Premier League start for Arsenal.

"Arsene Wenger has fuelled doubt over Wojciech Szczesny’s future after providing a bizarre response to questions regarding the goalkeeper’s omission on Sunday. Sportsmail understands the Polish goalkeeper arrived at the Emirates Stadium expecting to start in the 3-0 win over Stoke, despite being reprimanded for smoking in the showers following the New Year’s Day defeat at Southampton. However, the goalkeeper found that he had been dropped and replaced with David Ospina, a decision that is said to have stunned and bewildered the 24-year-old. VIDEO Scroll down for Szczesny the butt of Arsene's joke with journalists after Stoke match . Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger (right) said that Wojciech Szczesny was not dropped for disciplinary reasons . Szczesny was caught smoking in the showers after Arsenal's 2-0 defeat at Southampton on New Year's Day . And when questioned about Szczesny’s reaction to the news he had been axed, Wenger provided a confusing answer. After a long pause, Wenger said: ‘I don’t know, but how can you take a decision? You know how you can take a decision.’ And then, when asked about why he dropped Szczesny, Wenger added: ‘Look, I don’t want to talk too much about that because the more I talk, the less I inform you. Was the smoking incident the reason? No. Honestly, no.’ Nevertheless, Szczesny’s future at the club seems more uncertain than ever. Sportsmail revealed two weeks ago that Wenger had instructed his scouts to identify a new No 1 ahead of the summer transfer window due to Szczesny’s indifferent performances. And the keeper’s smoking antics at St Mary’s merely reinforced Wenger’s view that he needs a new shot-stopper in place for next season. Following his clean sheet in the FA Cup win over Hull last week, Ospina was handed his first Premier League start on Sunday. And after a second consecutive clean sheet, Szczesny will find it difficult to regain his place against Manchester City next weekend. ‘Will Ospina keep his place? I don’t know, I haven’t made a decision yet,’ insisted Wenger. ‘I made a decision for today’s game. Szczesny is our No 1, he is competing with Ospina and (Emiliano) Martinez and that’s our job, we have to accept that.’ Meanwhile, Mathieu Debuchy is facing a lengthy spell on the sidelines after dislocating a shoulder following a collision with Marko Arnautovic. The France international, who has only recently returned from a long-term lay-off due to an ankle injury, needed lengthy treatment after being pushed towards the advertising hoardings by the Stoke forward in the 12th minute. Debuchy had an X-ray but will see a specialist today to establish how long he will be unavailable, though he will definitely miss the clash against Manuel Pellegrini’s men. With Kieran Gibbs still suffering with an ankle problem and Calum Chambers missing Sunday's clash through illness, Debuchy’s injury has highlighted Arsenal’s need to sign another defender this month. Wenger said: ‘It doesn’t change my plans for the market because I was in the market anyway.’ Davis Ospina will replace Szczesny between the sticks as Arsenal take on Stoke City at The Emirates .","Wojciech Szczesny was found smoking after Arsenal's  Southampton loss .

"David Luiz claims he snubbed a new deal at Chelsea to move to PSG - rubbishing claims by Jose Mourinho that he was not wanted at Stamford Bridge. After Luiz left Chelsea in a £50million summer move, making him the world's most expensive defender, Mourinho said that the player was not first-choice at centre-back and was moving down the pecking order in central midfield. The Portuguese also suggested the Blues are better off and a stronger club without the often-erratic Brazilian. VIDEO Scroll down to watch David Luiz star for PSG in Ligue 1 debut . Paris Saint-Germain defender David Luiz (right) insists he does not regret leaving Chelsea during the summer . Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho (right) claimed Luiz was not wanted by the Stamford Bridge club . Luiz, pictured at his unveiling as a Paris Saint-Germain player, cost the French club £50million . Results on the pitch this season would certainly corroborate that, with Chelsea top of the league and unbeaten in their opening nine games in all competitions, winning seven of those. But Luiz claims: 'Chelsea offered me a new contract to stay but it was my choice to come here. I was happy with the plan PSG offered to me and I think it was exactly the right moment to move. 'I was so happy at Chelsea, I won two European titles and the FA Cup, it was great for me. 'I'm a lucky guy. I was playing for a big club like Chelsea and now I've got another opportunity to play for another big club. I'm enjoying it here.' Luiz won the Europa League, Champions League and the FA Cup before Mourinho returned for his second spell at Stamford Bridge in 2012. But he made just 15 Premier League appearances last year as he slipped out of favour. Following his departure, Mourinho said: 'Last season he was not regular first-choice for us. David did important things here, was always a good professional and we will miss him as a good guy when he was with us. But from a football point of view we believe our squad is stronger this season than it was. 'As a central defender he was not at all first-choice, it was John Terry and Gary Cahill during the whole season. In midfield he was a physical guy and gave us some important things, especially when we played in the Champions League when Nemanja Matic couldn’t play. 'But this season Matic can play in the Champions League so we don’t lose that physicality. The fact we also have Cesc Fabregas moves us in a different direction and we want to move in a different direction. It’s something that our football needs and we want to go in that direction.' Luiz, pictured in action against Monaco in Ligue 1, claims Chelsea offered him a new contract before he left . Luiz poses with Paris Saint-Germain chairman Nasser Al-Khelaifi (left) and his No 32 shirt . Luiz, pictured here with the Europa League trophy in 2013, won three major trophies at Stamford Bridge . Luiz has got off to a mixed start with his new club. They recorded a fine 3-2 win against Barcelona in the Champions League last week, in which the Brazilian scored his first goal for the club. But in the French Ligue 1 they are in fourth place, already seven points behind Marseille at the top. Luiz maintains that he has no regrets about leaving Chelsea and is confident he can win the Champions League at his new club. 'This is the plan we have,' he added. 'We have great players, a great coach and it's a great club. It's so difficult to win the Champions League, you have to win game by game. You need to qualify first if you want to win. 'I made my choice and I'm happy with my choice. I'm happy to see my friends at Chelsea playing very well, and I'm happy to be here.' Like MailOnline Sport's Facebook page.

"It's the dead of night on a chilly October evening. You drive down a deserted street in Wasco, California — the isolation of it all sending shivers up your spine. Then you see him: a white mask, unruly bright-red hair, eyes like black pools of death staring coldly at you. His yellow jumpsuit shines with light from the only lamp nearby, the multicolored balloons he holds floating lazily above his creepy face. The murderous clown looks at you, swinging back and forth on his mechanic toy unicorn, a frightening smile frozen on his pale face. Such has been the scene in this small town between Los Angeles and San Francisco, where since October 1 local residents have reported sightings of evil clowns roaming creepily down their streets. Creepy clowns such as this one have been popping up around Wasco, California . What would you do if you were walking down the street and ran into one of these creepy masked men? Some residents in Wasco follow social media to know when the next clown appearance will be so they can find these masked weirdos . Props and costumes change routinely, leading some to believe there is a menacing gang of bandits dressing up like the clowns from everyone's nightmares. 'I just seen him about three times already,' Anthony Garza, of Wasco, told KGET. 'But yeah—he's creepy.' Some brave souls have stayed tuned to social media, where locals report any sightings of the clown——  then go out hunting for the devilish creature once he's spotted. 'Some of the residents go in cars searching for him,' Noah Sanchez told KGET. 'They have flashlights and try and spot him in neighborhoods after he posts to Twitter.' Nobody really knows who the clowns are. Some people think it's one person, others say it's several. 'Yesterday they were saying there were two, then they were trying to say like seven, but I don't know,' Kevin Cabello  told KGET. Locals have mixed feelings about the clowns. One child says he was chased down the street with an ax, KGET reports. A deputy with the Kern County Sheriff's Office told the station that there have been reports of crimes committed in the neighborhood by people in clown costumes. A mysterious clown stands near a home in Wasco, California, as the creepy trend spreads . Despite the bizarre clown sightings, local cops say they haven't been involved in any criminal activity . But so far, none of the clowns has been actually linked to any crimes. 'We have had no reports of any assaults by a clown nor have we any arrests of any clowns at any time I have been here and I have been here two years,' Sgt. Ian Chandler told KGET. Despite creeping plenty of people out, the stunt strikes some locals — specially those searching for the clowns — as a big Halloween joke. 'It's kinda fun though to get us in the Halloween spirit and all of us in the community,' Sanchez told KGET. Some residents  in Wasco say the clowns are a great joke that is getting the town into the Halloween spirit . Some locals have turned the weird appearances into minor celebrities, chasing reported sightings all around town to take a picture with the clowns . One local Wasco resident, who requested anonymity, told KGET that he dressed up as the clown as part of a a year-long photography project with his wife. He told the station he didn't 'expect to start a trend, and did not mean to cause any harm.' The couple plans on posting more pictures on their social media accounts throughout October. Locals say the many-faced clowns popping up around town are likely the result of copy-cats.","Residents in Wasco, California, have reported seeing the creepy masked clowns all over town .

"Scroll down for video . Celebrated producer Shonda Rhimes — who created 'Grey's Anatomy' and 'Scandal' — has fired back at a New York Times TV critic who called her an 'angry black woman.' The piece that got Rhimes fuming ran in the Times on Thursday, in a piece about the upcoming ABC show 'How to Get Away With Murder.' TV critic Alessandra Stanley wrote: 'When Shonda Rhimes writes her autobiography, it should be called ""How to Get Away With Being an Angry Black Woman.""' 'Ms. Rhimes has embraced the trite but persistent caricature of the Angry Black Woman, recast it in her own image and made it enviable,' she added later. Shonda Rhimes (left) is nothing but smiles despite a New York Times piece by TV critic Alessandra Stanley that claims she 'embraced the trite but persistent caricature of the Angry Black Woman' Kerry Washington's Olivia Pope, from 'Scandal,' is one of the characters in Rhimes' shows that the piece claims embody the stereotype of the 'angry black woman' Rhimes, 44, took Stanley to task for mistaking her for the creator of 'How to Get Away with Murder' — and for using the stereotype that is widely considered offensive to black women. 'Confused . why @nytimes critic doesn't know identity of CREATOR of show she's . reviewing,' Rhimes tweeted about Pete Nowalk, a white male who created the series. She continued, 'Apparently we can be ""angry black women"" together, because I didn't know I was one either! @petenowa  #LearnSomethingNewEveryday' Rhimes, 44, later added: 'Wait. I'm"" angry"" AND a ROMANCE WRITER?!! I'm going to need to put down the internet and go dance this one out. Because ish is getting real.' The Internet — and actors in Rhimes' series — quickly reacted. 'Wow,' wrote Joshua Malina, who plays the prosecutor David Rosen on 'Scandal.' 'Did I just read a @nytimes piece that reduced my brilliant, creative, compassionate, thoughtful, badass boss to an “angry black woman?” Bellamy Young, who plays First Lady Mellie Grant on the show, said the move was 'deeply upsetting.' 'I was shocked.Maybe I don't get something?' she tweeted. Kerry Washington posted links to two articles decrying Stanley's controversial piece and added sarcastically: 'You're welcome.' Viola Davis (center) stars as Annalise Keating in 'How to Get Away With Murder' In response to the controversy, Stanley told BuzzFeed: . 'The whole point of the piece — once you read past the first 140 . characters — is to praise Shonda Rhimes for pushing back so successfully . on a tiresome but insidious stereotype.' This is not the first time Stanley takes a public beating over her work at the Times. The paper in 2009 had to issue a correction for six different items in a piece Stanley wrote about Walter Cronkite's career — including the day that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was shot and when Neil Armstrong landed on the moon, according to the Columbia Journalism Review. She also once mistakenly wrote that the Iraq War began in 2002 and that the sitcom 'Everybody Loves Raymond' — at the time a hugely popular series — was called 'All About Raymond,' according to Gawker.

"Three members of staff have been suspended following an incident relating to the care of an elderly patient at Mid Staffordshire hospital trust. An investigation has been launched after a member of nursing staff raised concerns over a 'lack of nursing care' on November 15. The hospital was the subject of a 2009 inquiry which found as many as 1,200 people may have needlessly died due to poor care over four years. A Mid Staffordshire Trust spokesman refused to reveal whether the suspended members of staff are nurses, and declined to comment on the elderly patient's condition. Three members of staff at Stafford Hospital have been suspended in relation to the care of an elderly patient . Julie Hendry, Director of Quality & Patient Experience at Mid Staffordshire NHS Foundation Trust said: ‘This incident, which was reported quickly by nursing staff, is in respect of a concern about lack of nursing care provided to an elderly patient on the 15th November at Stafford Hospital. 'Three members of staff who were on duty at the time have been suspended, while an immediate investigation is being carried out. 'Colin Ovington, Director of Nursing, along with the ward manager, met with the patient’s family as soon as we were aware of the allegation, to provide them with details of the incident and explain what actions are being undertaken.’ MP for Stafford, Jeremy Lefroy, said he was 'very disturbed' by the recent incident. 'The fact that a member of staff quickly report this appalling incident and the hospital took immediate action is an example of the culture of candour that must be upheld throughout the NHS,' he said. 'However, it is even more important that patients safety is paramount and that such things do not occur in the first place. Mr Lefroy added: 'The standard and quality of care at Stafford Hospital has improved in recent years, but there continues to be no room for complacency as this incident clearly demonstrates.' The health watchdog delivered a scathing verdict on standards of care earlier this month saying hospitals had made 'no improvement' since the Stafford scandal shook the NHS in 2008. A public inquiry lead by Robert Francis QC (pictured) produced a damning verdict on the hospital . The Care Quality Commission revealed it had issued twice as many notices to hospitals for putting patients at risk than last year. The amount of 'serious' problems - including patients going without food, being left on trolleys for hours and falling victim to severe staff shortages - has risen by fifth. A statement accompanying the annual report said: 'In the aftermath of the failures of care at Mid Staffordshire NHS foundation trust, our inspectors’ biggest concern in 2012/13 was that acute hospitals made no improvement in assessing and monitoring the  quality of the care they provided. ‘Hospitals did not improve their assessment and monitoring of the quality of the care they provided. 'There was also no improvement in safety and safeguarding, or in treating people with dignity and respect.' A damning 2009 Health commission report found the hospital subjected patients to poor conditions and inadequate care. Later, a public inquiry speared by Robert Francis QC uncovered claims treatment at the hospital was so bad, patients were left lying in their own urine and became so thirsty they were forced to drink water from flower vases.","Hospital has launched an investigation into the care of an elderly patient .

"Louis van Gaal believes Radamel Falcao's Premier League career will take off after the Colombia star claimed his first goal for Manchester United to clinch victory over Everton. Falcao, who could end up costing more than £50million if his loan move from Monaco becomes permanent, had failed to score in his first three games in England but pounced in the second half to give United a 2-1 win at Old Trafford. The 28-year-old missed several earlier opportunities and Van Gaal revealed that he had spoken to Falcao about trying too hard. Radamel Falcao celebrates his first goal in a Manchester United shirt against Everton on Sunday . The Colombian striker celebrates in front of the Sir Alex Ferguson Stand after opening his United account . Louis van Gaal said the expensive loan signing needed the goal after putting a lot of pressure on himself . 'He needed that goal,' said the United boss. 'I have talked with him because I thought he was forcing himself too much to score a goal. 'He's a player who will normally score a goal every match and has had to wait so long. I can understand that but now he has scored it will be better after the international break.' Victory lifted United into the top four but Van Gaal admitted his team are still not playing to full capacity after spending more than £150m in the summer. Falcao was in the right place - and onside - to turn in Angel Di Maria's attempted shot . Di Maria celebrates putting Manchester United 1-0 ahead against the Toffees at Old Trafford . 'I have told my players that we are not playing good but we are already fourth,' added the Dutchman. 'What is coming when we are playing well? 'I was amazed because we played such a very good first half and this is the second game (in a row) when we are not good in the second half.' United still needed a man-of-the-match performance from David de Gea to see the game out. The Spaniard became the first goalkeeper to save a Leighton Baines penalty in the Premier League after Luke Shaw fouled Tony Hibbert, and then made several outstanding stops late in the game. United might well have drawn or even lost against Everton were it not for  David de Gea's heroics . 'I'm devastated it was a penalty because I thought I touched the ball,' said Shaw. 'But all thanks to David De Gea. He was world-class and got us three points.' Defeat left Everton one place above the relegation zone and there was more bad news for Roberto Martinez when defender John Stones was carried off with an ankle injury that is likely to rule him out of England's Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia. The Everton boss was unhappy that the game was not stopped for another injury to Steven Pienaar in the build-up to Falcao's decisive goal. 'That action was a big mistake from the referee,' said Martinez. 'United attacked and the ball ends up in our net, and I don't think that is fair.'

"They may look like stills from an apocalyptic horror film, but these images have become a daily reality for residents in a Russian city. Citizens of Samara, in south east Russia, live in fear of the ground literally disappearing beneath them after huge sinkholes have started to appear all over their city, leaving devastation in their wake. The yawning underground caverns are all believed to have sprung up in recent weeks swallowing cars, buses and claiming at least one life. Scroll down for video . The city of Samara in Russia appears to be sinking into the earth, as massive sinkholes open up swallowing cars and wreaking havoc . The sinkholes, some large enough to swallow an entire truck, are believed to have opened up as the Russian winter subsides . There has reportedly been at least one fatality as a result of the sinkholes in the city, Russia's sixth largest . The . sinkholes, some large enough to swallow an entire truck, are believed . to have been caused by ground subsidence. It is thought the holes have been caused as ice thaws and melts into the ground, with the excess water causing soil decay underneath Samara's roads. The massive craters have appeared in car parks, busy intersections, by the sides of roads, and on major and minor . thoroughfares. The gaping craters have baffled residents who now live in daily fear of the ground literally swallowing them . Dozens of the massive craters, have appeared at random in recent weeks, reportedly as the winter thaws leaving the ground soaked with water . These pictures are all believed to have been taken in recent weeks as the ground decays beneath the city's infrastructure . Sinkholes are common hazards in mining regions, plaguing areas where miners have burrowed into layers of soluble minerals and accidental floods have followed . It is believed at least one person has lost their life as a result of one of the crashes caused by the sinkholes. The citizens of the city have now signed a petition urging authorities to find a solution. Sinkholes are common hazards in mining regions, plaguing areas where miners have burrowed into layers of soluble minerals and accidental floods have followed. But natural sinkholes can take thousands of years to form and vary in size. They are usually the result of what are known as Karst processes, which occur when a layer of rock such as limestone underneath the ground is dissolved by acidic water. Typically . rainfall seeps through the soil, absorbing carbon dioxide and reacting . with decaying vegetation. As a result, the water that reaches the . soluble rock is acidic. The problem is thought to be causing carnage across the city. Now residents have organised a petition to urge authorities to find a solution . The collapse of the surface above a sinkhole can happen suddenly or over a few hours. Heavy rainfall or poor drainage systems can trigger a collapse . The acidic water then erodes the soluble rock layers beneath the surface creating cavernous spaces. Then,  when it is no longer supported because of the cavity below, the soil or sand over the limestone collapses into a sinkhole. The collapse of the surface can happen suddenly or over a few hours. Heavy rainfall or poor drainage systems can trigger a collapse. Citizens in Berezniki, Russia, have also been plagued by sinkholes. Census data, though, shows that about 12,000 people left the town between 2005 and 2010, after a number of holes opened up. They are also common in Florida, America. Jeff Bush, 37, was swallowed into a sinkhole and killed while he slept in his bed in February in the . Tampa Bay area of Florida.","Citizens of Samara live in daily fear of the ground disappearing beneath them .

"A passenger may lose his eye after being hit with a hammer by an Uber cab driver. Roberto Chicas,  35, a San Francisco bartender, was attacked 23 September at Ellsworth and Alemany Boulevard and left unconscious on the sidewalk. Doctors are unsure if he will lose sight in his right eye and he now faces facial reconstructive surgeries. Roberto Chicas, 35, a San Francisco bartender, was attacked 23 September at Ellsworth and Alemany Boulevard and left unconscious on the sidewalk . The driver of the car, Patrick Karajah,Karajah, 26, has been was charged with assault with a deadly weapon and battery with serious bodily injury, and has pleaded not guilty. Chicas's attorney Harry Stern said his client had just finished having drinks following a night of work when he called the cab, reports the San Francisco Gate. Stern said the trouble began when Karajah took the freeway rather than city streets to get to Chicas' home. 'When the passengers asked the driver why he was taking that route, he became agitated, stopping twice to try to force them out of the car, Stern said. 'The female passenger really tried to placate the driver and calm everybody down, but the driver just got more and more agitated and finally snapped,' Stern said. Doctors are unsure if he will lose sight in his right eye and he now faces facial reconstructive surgeries. Pictured: Chicas, left, before the attack and right in hospital . Chicas was attacked at Ellsworth and Alemany Boulevard (pictured) and left unconscious on the sidewalk . He said Karajah pulled over in front of a public housing complex at Ellsworth Street and Alemany Boulevard, and told the three friends to get out. 'For reasons that are unknown at this point, he then snapped and smashed Roberto on the side of the head with a claw hammer,' Stern said. Karajah's attorney did not return calls seeking comment. District Attorney George Gascon said Karajah has no criminal background, Gascon said and is currently free on $125,000 bail, reports San Francisco CBS. Gascon has sent letters to ridesharing companies about possible violations of state and local laws including misleading information about driver background checks, reports ABC7 News. 'It's not like I'm against the business model. I support anything that creates innovation and provides improvement for the consumer, we just have to balance it out with customer protection,' Gascon said. In a statement Uber  said:' We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done'. Pictured: The Uber phone app . Gascon said the companies are not following procedures that would keep them safe, such as background checks, saying he has evidence that people with significant criminal records are driving for some of these services. In a statement sent to KPIX 5, Uber spokesperson Eva Behrend said: . 'Safety is Uber's #1 priority. We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care. It is also our policy to immediately suspend a driver's account following any serious allegations, which we have done. We stand ready to assist authorities in any investigation.' 'Rider safety is Uber’s #1 priority. We take reports like this seriously and are treating the matter with the utmost urgency and care.' This message from ride-sharing company Uber was seen when a D.C. driver was accused of sexually assaulting a sleeping passenger. It was also seen when an Atlanta driver allegedly pulled a gun on a valet. And when an Orlando driver reportedly touched a rider under her blouse. Buzzfeed published a collection of statements the company released in the wake of eight incidents where drivers were accused of bad behavior or were involved in a crash. The announcements seem to follow a boilerplate formula, beginning with the representative talking about rider safety being Uber's priority, saying the company will respond with the 'utmost urgency and care.' In certain instances, the spokesperson will say they are suspending the driver or saying Uber is ready to aid investigators, as they did when an Alabama driver was found with weed and an open bottle of vodka in his vehicle. According to a blog post on Uber's site, their policy is to conduct background checks on drivers that include looking at criminal history going back seven years. Recently the company has faced criticism over rider safety. The Chronicle reported that the district attorneys of San Francisco and Los Angeles called some practices of Uber and two other ride-sharing companies a 'continuing threat to consumers.' Uber has not responded for comment as of yet.","Roberto Chicas, 35, a San Francisco bartender, was attacked 23 September .

Immediately, as he clips some of the packed ice below, the whole mountainside starts giving way. Nagle is forced to ride the snowy wave out. Miraculously he escapes the freezing tide unscathed. In the video - shot on Sunday - Nagle's friend is seen waiting for him in a safe location. He had skied the mountain just moments before with no problem. Nagle said that it was a struggle staying upright as he skied over 'block-shaped chunks' of snow. Eventually, thanks to his skill, he made it to smoother terrain.

"The Foreign Office minister who quit because of ‘intolerable’ expenses rules is the owner of a million-pound mansion, bought using profits from the sale of his taxpayer-funded home. Mark Simmonds, the MP for Boston and Skegness, resigned on Monday complaining his income did not cover the cost of renting a Westminster flat big enough for his family. But the 50-year-old already owns a seven-bedroom grade-II listed house with a heated swimming pool. Scroll down for video . 17th century splendour: The £1.25million mansion in Mark Simmonds's constituency of Boston and Skegness . The Simmonds' family enjoy access to a luxury private pool at Swineshead Abbey near Boston . Mr Simmonds has claimed more than £1.7million in expenses since becoming a Tory MP in 2001. He also made more than £500,000 by selling a house on which the taxpayer paid the mortgage interest. Six months after becoming an MP, he bought a five-bedroom house in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000. From 2001 to 2009, he claimed £2,000 a month for the mortgage interest. When expenses rules were changed to ban such claims, he sold the property in January 2011 for £1,187,500 – £537,000 more than he paid. The same month, he used the massive profit to help buy the 17th-century property in his constituency for £900,000. Set in 15 acres, it has formal gardens, a garage for three cars, a tennis court and a heated outdoor swimming pool. Mr Simmonds' claims that he could not afford to live in London and that the pressure on his family life had become 'intolerable' were dismissed as 'total nonsense' by one Labour MP . The sprawling Lincolnshire estate includes a number of family rooms to relax for Mr Simmonds and his wife after they leave politics . Couple: In 2012/13 Mr Simmonds claimed £176,177.87 in expenses, including a salary of up to £25,000 for his wife Lizbeth in her role as his office manager. They are pictured together . It is now valued at £1.25million and was partly created from the ruins of an ancient abbey where King John reputedly once stayed. Yesterday, an Audi 4x4 and a Mercedes were parked outside. Mr Simmonds said on Monday that he will leave Parliament at next year’s election because he rarely sees his three children, who live in his constituency. 'If MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them. But that’s not the lifestyle I want and not the lifestyle I have chosen' Mark Simmonds . He said his expenses ‘do not stretch to renting a flat near Westminster large enough for my children, so I stay in a hotel. I hate it’. When asked how a rental allowance of £27,875 a year plus £2,500 for each child was not enough, he said: ‘If MPs want to get into the business of travelling extensively from Westminster to the outer reaches of London to rent a flat then that’s up to them. ‘But that’s not the lifestyle I want and not the lifestyle I have chosen.’ It is understood Mr Simmonds has been charging the taxpayer to stay in a four-star hotel close to the Houses of Parliament. Sold for £1,187,500 in 2011: Six months after becoming an MP, he bought a house (pictured) in Putney, south-west London, for £650,000. From 2001 to 2009, he claimed £2,000 a month for the mortgage interest . He receives a salary of £89,435. In 2012/13 he claimed £176,177.87 in expenses, including a salary of up to £25,000 for his wife Lizbeth in her role as his office manager. Mr Simmonds is still chairman of the property business he founded in 1999. From June 2011 to September 2012 he also earned £50,000 a year as a strategic adviser to medical provider Circle Healthcare. Mr . Simmonds’ two daughters, aged 15 and 13, and son, aged 12, are all . educated at private schools with fees that start from £13,350 a year. 'His comments will gain little public sympathy when under his government most working families, especially in London, are facing a cost of living crisis' Grahame Morris, Labour MP . Labour MP John Mann poured scorn on the idea that the Commons housing allowance was not enough to afford to live in London. He said his complaint was ‘nonsense’. He said: ‘The £28,000 he can get is more than the average salary in his constituency. It’s simply untrue that you can’t rent in London for that much.’ Mr Mann's remarks came as MailOnline discovered a host of luxury flats within half a mile of Westminster, which Mr Simmonds could easily afford using his taxpayer-funded allowance. MailOnline has found a number of luxury flats within half a mile of Westminster which he could easily afford from his taxpayer-funded housing allowance. If the Tory MP insisted on bringing down his family for weekends, he has a number of options for accommodation close to Westminster. Mr Simmonds could afford a luxury, fully-furnished property with access to communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym just minutes from Parliament near the London Eye . If the former Foreign Office minister could cope with a 20 minute train ride from Bromley, he could rent a four bed house in the South London commuter belt . There are also scores of four-bed family homes in London's sought-after suburbs - home to hundreds of thousands of Conservative voters - within Mr Simmonds' budget. For a home within easy walking distance from Westminster Mr Simmonds could rent a mid-terrace Georgian house conversion with three large double bedrooms, a big family kitchen, living room and a garden in Oval - less than 2 miles from Parliament. The house costs £24,444 a year. If he was willing to use public transport, the allowance would get him a luxury four bed semi-detached property with large garden in Bromley, South London, for £27,000 a year. Bromley – a core Conservative-stronghold in London’s commuter belt – is just 20 minutes away from Victoria station, which is just 15 minutes walk from Parliament. If Mr Simmonds opted for a one-bed flat for himself to stay in London, while his family stayed in his constituency his ‘generous’ Commons housing allowance would allow him to stay in the lap of luxury. A quick search on online estate agents 'rightmove' shows a number of luxury flats available to rent with a stone's throw of Parliament . According to the online estate agents ‘rightmove’, Mr Simmonds could afford a one-bedroom apartment less than half a mile from Parliament. The luxury, fully-furnished property allows access to a communal gardens and leisure facilities - including a pool and a gym. Another apartment just a stones throw from Westminster available in Mr Simmonds' price bracket is a 'beautiful one bedroom fully furnished apartment with a secure underground car parking space close to local amenities and St James' underground tube station'. 'The property was fully refurbished in 2009 and remains in excellent condition throughout. The property also has a private balcony that overlooks the gardens to the rear.' According to the estate agents renting the property 'residents of Vestry Court enjoy exclusive use of the private swimming pool, Jacuzzi, sauna and gym facilities'. It is 'conveniently located for access to London's West End, and Waterloo and Westminster underground stations', according to the estate agent.","Mark Simmonds, the MP for Boston and Skegness, resigned on Monday .

"New York City police officers drew blood from an 84-year-old man on Sunday who was alleged to have jaywalked near a dangerous intersection in the Upper West Side. Kang Wong, who lives in the area, was stopped by an officer for allegedly crossing against the light, just before 5 p.m. According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn’t seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away. Kang Wong, who lives near the Upper West Side, was stopped by an officer for allegedly crossing the street against the light, on Sunday . ‘The guy didn’t seem to speak English,’ Ian King, a 24-year-old Fordham law student, told the New York Post. ‘He [the officer] stood him up against the wall and was trying to write him a ticket. The man didn’t seem to understand, and he started walking away.’ That’s when the officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied. ‘The cop tried to pull him back and that’s when he [the pedestrian] began to struggle with the cop,’ said King. According to one witness, several officers quickly converged on the man, who didn't seem to understand English-language commands, after he simply tried to walk away . ‘As soon as he pushed the cop, it was like cops started running in from everywhere.’ With the man’s blood left spilled on the pavement, he was handcuffed and taken to a local hospital. Police, who have promised to step-up enforcement, said they were looking into the arrest. Law enforcement in the area had earlier promised to step-up enforcement of the law after three pedestrians were struck and killed . within a two-block radius in the neighborhood in nine days. A police officer and several colleagues quickly converged on the senior citizen and left him badly beaten and bloodied . The latest crash occurred when a 26-year-old woman, Samantha Lee, was crossing 96th street when she was clipped by the driver’s side mirror of an ambulance. She was run over by a red, four-door Dodge Charger after ending  up face-down in the road and was pronounced dead at the scene. Both drivers stayed at the scene and no arrests were immediately made.

"Keane told Sir Alex Ferguson 'we need f****** more from you' in furious row that led to Irishman leaving Manchester United . Keane says he wouldn't have missed a drugs test like Rio Ferdinand and Manchester United suffered as a result . Roy Keane has revealed the astonishing details of a fight with Peter Schmeichel that left the Great Dane with a black eye. The Manchester United legends came to blows during a pre-season tour of Asia. Keane's new autobiography The Second Half, published this week lays bare the scrap - which saw legendary manager Sir Alex Ferguson brand the Old Trafford icons 'a disgrace to the club.' Roy Keane (right), pictured here arguing with his team-mate Peter Schmeichel (third from right) in 1995, has admitted leaving the goalkeeper with a black eye after a fight during a pre-season tour to Asia .

Biggest clash: Was accused of using racist language towards Arsenal's Ian Wright after scuffling with him in the tunnel following a two-footed lunge by the striker in 1997. 'I had a bust-up with Peter when we were on a pre-season tour of Asia, in 1998 (actually in 1997), just after I came back from my cruciate injury. I think we were in Hong Kong. There was drink involved,' wrote Keane in an extract serialised in the Daily Mirror. Keane revealed he often didn't see eye-to-eye with the former United keeper over his on-field conduct, with Schmeichel famed for shouting at his defenders. Keane continued by describing the morning afterwards: 'The manager had a go at us as we were getting on the bus, and people were going on about a fight in the hotel the night before. It started coming back to me - the fight between me and Peter. 'In the meantime, Nicky Butt had been filling me in on what had happened the night before. Butty had refereed the fight. Anyway, Peter had grabbed me, I'd head-butted him - we'd been fighting for ages. 'Once we were at Juventus – they were playing Chelsea. We were standing at the corner flag and Adrian (Chiles) was next to me. He goes: ""This is great isn’t it?"". I went: ""I used to play in these games Adrian"". I wasn’t being cocky. 'It’s about justification, what you stand for. When I was at United I was getting paid good money but I could go: ""Yeah, but I'm giving it back to you"". I didn’t feel that way with this TV work. It’s an easy gig. I don’t like easy gigs. When I heard: ""I liked your commentary last night"". I knew I was only talking bulls*** like the rest of them. Hopefully my bulls*** was a bit better. I wanted to do something that excited me. TV work didn’t excite me. 'I liked Adrian and Lee Dixon, though. What I really enjoyed was the company. I liked meeting people, old players like Liverpool’s Jan Molby. Some United fans saw us together and one of them said: “Why the f*** are you talking to him?”. I felt like saying: “I will speak to who I f***ing want to!""' Keane, pictured kissing the FA Cup after beating Millwall in 2004, enjoyed a successful 12 years at United .

The questions came at him ""Peter, what happened to your eye?"" '[Schmeichel] said, ""I just got an elbow last night, in training"". And that was the end of it.' Keane bizarrely goes on to say that Sir Bobby Charlton, who at the time would have been 60, could have split up the two Premier League hard men after being woken up by the warring pair. However, the Irishman did praise Schmeichel for taking responsibility for the scrap, adding that he 'admired' the goalkeeper. 'I wonder about the current United dressing room. When a manager like Sir Alex Ferguson is replaced the new man needs a helping hand. Does that mean every player should like him? No. 'But I look at the current players and they should be doing a lot better. Not liking a manager can never be an excuse for not going out and doing your best.

"A 100-year-old time capsule found in Baltimore might remain shut for fear the contents could be destroyed if it is opened. The copper box was discovered during the renovation of the original Washington Monument in Baltimore. Conservationists fear that as the time capsule's content has been exposed to dampness for nearly a century, it may not survive an opening. Blast from the past: This copper box was discovered in a niche during the renovation of the Washington Monument in Baltimore . The time capsule was discovered behind a plaque at the monument in Baltimore's Mount Vernon neighborhood. The sealed box was put behind the plaque, placed in front of a niche to commemorate the monument's centennial, on Defender's Day, Sept. 12, 1915. Monument officials say research has found that the time capsule contains commemorative programs and copies of The Baltimore Sun, among other items. 'We are restoring the interior plaster finishes in the Monument, most of which have been reworked many times over the years because of water damage,' said Lance Humphries, Chair of the Conservancy's restoration committee. The time capsule, placed behind a commemorative plaque from 1915, are said to contain commemorative programs from the centennial event and copies of the local newspaper, The Baltimore Sun . Discoveries: The commemorative plaque, right, was removed in the hopes that it would give a clue about the original appearance of the room, and workers were stunned to find the box .

"The White House has released a report on the youth of today - and named them the Homeland Generation. The title is eerily reminiscent of the Showtime political thriller series Homeland which documents an unstable world of surveillance and terrorism in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. No explanation was given for the name, which is said to describe Americans born from 2005 onwards. Homeland Generation: The White House released this unexplained graph coining a new title for under-10s . Eerie: The name is reminiscent of the hit Showtime series set in a turbulent world of surveillance and terrorism . And although it was selected by a focus group, White House communications staff have come under fire for adopting the 'creepy' moniker. 'It's really creepy to call people born after 2004 the Homeland Generation and it needs to stop,' wrote one Twitter user, who shared a link to the White House graph. Another tweeted: 'I just heard the term ""Homeland Generation"" for the first time in reference to my kids and I found it chilling'. Others mocked the apparent reference to the TV series. One said: 'the ""homeland gemeration"" doesn't make any ense at all, the show didn't start until 2011'. And another wrote: 'Homeland generation? I'd go Lost or Breaking Bad generation.' The name was pioneered by the same research company that first decided the Millennial generation ended in 2004, New Strategist Publications. After holding a competition, the company received overwhelming support from a focus group for Homelanders over iGenerationers and Generation Wii-ers. Fear: The characters are dogged by fear surrounding extremism and struggle to fight Middle Eastern powers . Dosed up: Claire Danes's character Carrie is permanently medicated and psychotic in the show . In the hit series, which premiered its fourth series last week, features a character called Carrie who is psychotic and dosed up on medication. The world is in turmoil following the 9/11 attacks, and the CIA is in a constant struggle against Islamic extremism. The release of the report, and the phrase 'Homeland generation', comes amid fraught tensions with the Middle East as ISIS continues to sweep through Iraq and beheads its western hostages. According to generational theorists William Strauss and Neil Howe - who created the name Millennials - Homelanders 'will be tracked by mobile digital technology, screened by psychological software, and surveilled by entertainment controls that limit their access to anything inappropriate. 'Older Americans will regard them as well-behaved and diligent - yet also as innocent, risk-averse, and emotionally fragile.' It is a lifestyle, they say, constructed by their parents who want to shield their children from the drug-fueled 'Dazed and Confused' childhood they experienced.","Report by White House inexplicably dubs youth of today 'Homelanders'

"Michelle Obama, who turns 50 later this week, isn't ruling out using plastic surgery or Botox in the future. 'Women should have the freedom to do whatever they need to do to feel good about themselves,' the first lady told People magazine in an interview hitting newsstands Friday, her birthday. 'Right now, I don't imagine that I would go that route, but I've also learned to never say never.' Never say never! Michelle Obama (pictured here at the White House in September 2013) who turns 50 later this week, isn't ruling out using plastic surgery or Botox in the future . Her message to women is to be healthy. Mrs Obama says she has never missed a health checkup, including mammograms and Pap smears. She's also had a colonoscopy. 'I don't obsess about what I eat, but I do make sure that I'm eating vegetables and fruit,' added Mrs Obama. 'And as everyone knows, I do exercise.' Her Let's Move campaign to reduce childhood obesity rates through the combination of exercise and healthier eating enters its fifth year next month. 'As you get older, you start . understanding what clothes feel good rather than trying to keep up with your teenage daughter' Her workouts have also evolved from weight-bearing and cardio exercises to include things like yoga that she says will help keep her flexible. When it comes to dressing 'age-appropriatly', Mrs Obama says that she likes to highlight the best parts of her body. 'I have long legs; I have hips. My shape is different from the vast majority of women's. 'As you get older, you start understanding what makes you happy and feel good and going with that rather than following the fashion trends or trying to keep up with your teenage daughter.' Spreading the word: The First Lady's Let's Move campaign to reduce childhood obesity rates through the combination of exercise and healthier eating enters its fifth year next month . Keeping fit: When it comes to personal fitness, Mrs Obama says she has incorporated yoga into her routine in a bid to stay flexible . Asked whether she has peaked at 50 in terms of her career, Mrs Obama joked that being First Lady is 'pretty high up.' She said she's always felt that her life is 'ever-evolving' and she doesn't have the right to 'just sit on my talents or blessings.' 'I've got to keep figuring out ways to have an impact, whether as a mother or as a professional or as a mentor to other kids,' the first lady said, noting that daughter Malia, now 15, will be in college when she and President Barack Obama leave the White House in January 2017. 'I don't obsess about what I eat, but I do make sure that I'm eating vegetables and fruit' Daughter Sasha, 12, won't be far behind.'At that point in life, whoa, the sky is the limit,' Mrs Obama said. On a personal note, Mrs Obama says shedreams of seeing the 'places that make this planet beautiful' over the next two decades before hitting 70. 'I still haven't seen the Hoover Dam. I want to stay and have a meal, try the local dish and shop in a little shop.' In the meantime, President Obama is planning a big dance party at the White House on Saturday night so she can see out her 50th in style. Aides are keeping a tight lid on details to maintain the element of surprise for Mrs Obama. Guests have been told to come prepared to dance and to eat before they come. 'I don't obsess about what I eat, but I do make sure that I'm eating vegetables and fruit,' Mrs Obama said . 'There's one thing I can tell you for sure . . . people will move,' Valerie Jarrett, a senior White House adviser who is close to the Obamas, told The Associated Press. Jarrett wouldn't comment on reports that Beyonce, who also is close to the Obama family, will sing at the first lady's party. Beyonce serenaded the Obamas as they danced at one of the balls for the president's first inauguration in 2009. Last year, she lip-synced to a pre-recorded voice track of the national anthem at Obama's second swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol. Coincidentally, Beyonce's husband, rapper and entrepreneur Jay Z, is scheduled to bring his Magna Carter World Tour to Washington's Verizon Center on Thursday night, two days before Mrs Obama's White House birthday blowout. That means Beyonce could be in town anyway.",The First Lady says she has also incorporated yoga into her exercise routine in a bid to stay flexible .
"Seven years ago this week, Jordan Henderson was the only Sunderland reserve-team player to remain on the bench at a windswept and rain-lashed Kingston Park. The Black Cats' second string had just beaten North-East rivals Newcastle 3-1 but they didn't need a 17-year-old Henderson. He was highly-rated but yet to make his senior bow and a loan spell at Coventry City beckoned. That same year he lost out to academy team-mate Nathan Luscombe in the Soccer AM Skill Skool showdown. Luscombe now plays for Celtic Nation in the Northern league. Jordan Henderson tussles with Sunderland's Liam Bridcutt during Liverpool's 1-0 win at the Stadium of Light . Henderson, however, is set to inherit the Liverpool captaincy from MLS-bound Steven Gerrard. On Saturday, he was back at the club who sold him to the Reds for £20million in 2011. And, after Gerrard made way at half-time, we were afforded a 45-minute snapshot of life with Henderson as leader. It is now almost certain he will be appointed club captain in the summer. And, following the 1-0 win, Brendan Rodgers said: 'I've already put him as vice-captain of the club. He's grown, not just as a footballer, but as a young man over the past two-and-a-half years with me. You could see his quality and his leadership, his running ability and power. 'He's a fantastic young man and the reason for giving him that role (vice-captain), was that for when Steven isn't on the field he's a real leader for us. Steven Gerrard was substituted at half-time and has agreed to join MLS side LA Galaxy in the summer . 'There's no question that he can go and become the captain at the club.' In the first half, with Gerrard at his side, the pair had bossed the contest, teasing passes between themselves and the outstanding Philippe Coutinho, outclassing and outworking their red-and-white adversaries. Minus Gerrard, though, Henderson assumed added responsibility. His first task was to take a necessary booking for his side, clipping the heels of Adam Johnson with the Sunderland winger in full flight and headed for a backpedaling rearguard. Henderson assumed Liverpool's captaincy after Gerrard was taken off and impressed with his leadership . Conscious of his caution, Henderson stationed himself at the centre of the park. From there he dictated the tempo of a game which was always within the grasp of he and his comrades and they emerged comfortable winners, despite the 1-0 scoreline. He may not boast the dynamic forward bursts of Gerrard, but there is a discipline about Henderson which serves as reassurance for manager Brendan Rodgers. Henderson has made 160 appearances for Liverpool since arriving from Sunderland in 2011 for £20million . Indeed, as Mario Balotelli lined up one 40-yard free-kick, it was to Henderson whom Rodgers screamed advising against a shot on goal. Balotelli duly crashed an audacious effort into the wall regardless of the instruction, but it was clear who the man on the touchline trusted as his onfield general in the absence of Gerrard. Henderson speaks of his soon-to-be-former team-mate in the highest regard. He does, though, see himself as the heir apparent at Anfield. Henderson lines up a shot from midfield against his former club on Saturday . 'There's only one leader at the moment and that is Stevie,' said the England midfielder. 'Next season with Stevie going then things may change a little. Everyone was in shock as he is such a big leader for us. He said the time is right so we have to respect that.' Now, however, you must respect Henderson as the captain-in-waiting at Anfield. On this evidence, he will do a fine job.

"However much London's pigeons are universally disliked, many would admit their freedom to roam the city's skies fills them with jealously. The filthy urban birds truly have the run of the city, with the best views of the city's landmarks like the London Eye, City Hall and St Paul's Cathedral. University of London researchers have combined the Google Earth flight simulator with a motion sensitive controller to allow people to fly around the city using bird movements. Scroll down for video . The view from above: This screenshot shows the view of London offered by the University of London's Pigeon Simulator .

The research is part of work into urban simulations and procedural modelling undertaken by a team from the Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spatial Analysis (CASA) at University College London. As part of the public outreach side of the work, they have created a the Pigeon Simulator where you can fly like a pigeon exploring different parts of London. The simulator uses a Microsoft Kinect sensor to track users' body movements and gestures and converts them into movements through Google Earth 3D's web plugin. Become one with the pigeon: This image shows how the software reads to user's movements and translates them to pigeon movements within the simulator . Bird foot: Pigeon footprints mark the spot where users stand to control the simulator . Andrew Hudson-Smith, head of CASA, said his team were hoping to bring the simulator to the Museum of Leeds for the public to try and were in negotiation to have one installed in a public area of London's City Hall. 'It's fun but it's trying to communicate a point that there's all these live feeds out there,' he told MailOnline Science. 'Every time we tweet and every time we use a phone we are putting these live feeds out there which can be put to use.' He added: 'We can write reports that go out to councils and government offices, but people don't really read those; but if you can fly around Leeds or London then you can see things like traffic flows and all this data presented.'","Developed by researchers from University College London's Bartlett Centre for Advanced Spacial Analysis .

"Lazar Markovic's early strike and lively first-half performance was enough for Liverpool to escape the Stadium of Light with all three points. Here, Craig Hope runs through how the players performed. SUNDERLAND (4-1-4-1) Costel Pantilimon -  5.5 . Kicking suspect yet again and does little to instil confidence in his defence. Santiago Vergini - 5 . A disaster at times, giving ball away and failing to get forward. A torrid afternoon. Wes Brown - 5.5 . Could not handle movement and trickery of Liverpool frontline and was run ragged. Very lucky not to concede early penalty. John O’Shea - 6 . Tried his best to lead backline but was himself at sixes and sevens. Costel Pantilimon manages to divert Liverpool striker Fabio Borini away from goal at the Stadium of Light . Patrick van Aanholt - 5.5 . Got forward when possible but lacked quality and was also caught dithering once or twice at other end. Liam Bridcutt - 5 . Saw enough of ball and broke things up, but was simply outclassed and was needlessly sent off despite soft nature of second booking. Adam Johnson - 6 . Not enough flair or invention when his side needed it in first half but was much improved after break and cracked bar with one vicious drive. Jordi Gomez - 5 . Anonymous throughout and slowed things up far too much when he did come into possession. Emanuele Giaccherini attempts to keep the ball from Liverpool defender Mamadou Sakho on Saturday . Seb Larsson - 6 . Way below standards he has set this season but was doing the job of two men after Bridcutt dismissal. Emanuele Giaccherini - 5.5 . The odd flash of creativity but off the pace against fitter and stronger opponents. Connor Wickham - 5.5 . Not afforded a kick in the first half but was hardly helped by poor supply-line. SUBSTITUTES . Will Buckley (on 77) - 5.5 . Danny Graham (on 77) - 6 . Liam Bridcutt receives his marching orders after picking up a second yellow card against Liverpool . LIVERPOOL (3-4-2-1) Simon Mignolet - 6 . A spectator in the first-half but did what he had to with minimum fuss after break. Martin Skrtel - 6.5 . Strong when he had to be, although that wasn’t often. Emre Can - 7 . Strolled through and used his passing range to prise open Sunderland defence from deep before moving into midfield and again impressing second-half. Lazar Markovic (centre) celebrates with Liverpool team mates after scoring the opener in the first-half . Mamadou Sakho - 6.5 . Like the rest of his defensive comrades he enjoyed an easy 90 minutes. Lazar Markovic - 7.5 . Should have won a penalty before his clever opener and was close to spectacular second. Beginning to shine after slow start. Lucas Leiva - 7 . Barely had to break sweat but kept the ball well and anchored midfield with authority. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard celebrates in front of the away fans after his side took a first-half lead . Jordan Henderson - 7.5 . Never wasted a ball and teased passes around the park. Took the armband second half. A class act. Alberto Moreno - 6.5 . Saw the weakness in Vergini and supported attack at every opportunity. Steven Gerrard - 7 . Was in the mood for goals and went close three times in first half before departing at interval. Philippe Coutinho - 8 . Outstanding, so easy on the eye and terrorised hosts with his cunning runs. Man of the match. Jordan Henderson lets fire but his long range effort flew high and wide over the Sunderland goal . Fabio Borini - 7 . He was more graft than craft and did not allow home defence a moment’s rest. SUBSTITUTES . Dejan Lovren (on 46) - 6.5 . Rash booking was first contribution but steadied and was comfortable. Mario Balotelli (on 66) - 6 . Frustrated team-mates at times with poor decision-making but picked up where Borini left off with work-rate.

"It is the plane that could finally end the argument over who gets the window seat. A firm attempting to build a private supersonic jet has revealed a radical new design where the entire cabin wall is a screen that can be turned into a giant window. Live video from outside the plane can create a panoramic image - or the passengers of the $60m jet can opt to have their family snaps shown or even watch a movie on the walls. Scroll down for video . The supersonic jet has a revolutionary windowless passenger cabin. Instead, the interior walls will be covered with a thin display screen. The spike S-512 is a supersonic jet that will enable travelers to reach destinations in half the time it currently takes.

The Spike Aerospace S-512 claims to be the 'first supersonic business jet' and promises to cut flight times in half so that busy billionaires will be able to travel from New York to London in just three hours. However, such convenience and speed comes at a price, as the jet will cost between $60million and $80million (£36.3million and £48.4million). The engineers, who have previously worked for aerospace giants such as Airbus, Gulfstream and Bombardier, have spent the past two years designing the luxury aircraft and believe the jet will be capable of flying between New York and London in three hours. LA to Tokyo will take just five hours and London to Mumbai, four hours, according to the firm. ‘It will save passengers time so they can explore more of the world,' the company said. 'Wouldn’t you love to go hiking in New Zealand for the weekend, or fly to Paris for lunch? The new supersonic jet will also feature a revolutionary windowless passenger cabin so no more glaring sun and no more shades to pull down or push up. Instead, the interior walls will be covered with a thin display screens embedded into the wall. Cameras surrounding the entire aircraft will construct breathtaking panoramic views displayed on the cabin screens. Passengers will be able to dim the screens to catch some sleep or change it to one of the many scenic images stored in the system. 'There are several reasons for removing the windows from the cabin,' the firm said. 'It has long been known that the windows cause significant challenges in designing and constructing an aircraft fuselage. They require addition structural support, add to the parts count and add weight to the aircraft. But until recently, it has not been possible to do without them. 'With the micro-cameras and flat displays now available, Spike Aerospace can eliminate the structural issues with windows and reduce the aircraft weight. In addition, the very smooth exterior skin will reduce the drag normally caused by having windows.' The jet can cruise cruise at average speeds of Mach 1.6-1.8 (1060-1200 mph . Cameras surrounding the entire aircraft will beam panoramic views to the cabin screens. Passengers will be able to dim the screens to catch some sleep or change it to one of the many scenic images stored in the system. ‘The supersonic jet will let you do more, faster,’ it added. The jet, which is designed to carry between 12 and 18 passengers in the lap of luxury, is intended to take off in December 2018. However, despite impressive engineering, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has banned supersonic flight over the U.S. making popular flights such as LA to New York unlikely in the near future. Companies including Nasa and Boeing are currently trying to develop supersonic aircraft of their own to reduce the noise - or boom - that the jets make when breaking the sound barrier. Vik Kachoria, President and CEO of Spike Aerospace, wrote in a blog that Elon Musk, founder of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, told a New York times Dealbook conference that 'there’s an interesting opportunity to create a supersonic, electric, vertical take-off and landing jet.' ‘It seems unlikely to come from Boeing or Airbus, given that they seem to be focused on very incremental improvements to their planes as opposed to radical improvements. So it could come from a start-up. ¿It will save passengers time so they can explore more of the world,' the company said. 'Wouldn¿t you love to go hiking in New Zealand for the weekend, or fly to Paris for lunch? ‘If I were to have another company in the future, which would not be any time soon, I think that would be the thing do,’ he added. Mr Kachoria said aspirations of vertical take-off and landing might be ‘a stretch’ for the first iteration of a new supersonic aircraft.","Live video from outside the plane can create a panoramic image .

"Controversial plans to shut NHS hospital wards across the country – which could trigger a fresh wave of A&E closures – are quietly being drawn up by health bosses, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Billions of pounds will be diverted from hospital budgets to help pay for better care homes and home help under the proposals, which are set to be signed off by Ministers within weeks. But according to official plans seen by this paper, it will force the imminent closure of emergency medical wards, surgical wards and dementia wards. Closures: Controversial plans to shut NHS hospital wards could trigger a fresh wave of A&E closures . Frontline doctors also fear the massive shake-up will cause more A&E departments to close – at a time of rapidly rising demand for emergency care. Since 2007, eight English A&Es have been closed or downgraded. Another 14 are known to be under threat and last year there were a record 3.8million emergency admissions. The £3.8billion Better Care Fund is meant to ensure that the sick and elderly only end up in hospital when they really need to be there and stop them staying in a ward for longer than necessary. But NHS England calculations have shown that the scheme will ‘transfer’ at least £2billion a year from the health service budget. Ministers are due to approve the ward . closures by April 21. One leading A&E doctor warned last night that . the plans would ‘break the system’, leaving emergency patients without . beds. Dr Chidi Ejimofo said handing so much . NHS money to social care was ‘like robbing Peter to pay Paul’, adding: . ‘I think there’s every chance this could lead to a new wave of A&E . closures.’ Elderly: Under the proposals, billions of pounds will be diverted from hospital budgets to pay for care homes . The consultant, who last year helped save A&E at Lewisham Hospital in South-East London from the axe, went on to say: ‘These plans are extremely worrying given that hospitals are already in a precarious state. We are on the edge of an unmitigated disaster.’ The Government has tried to deny that the Better Care Fund amounts to an NHS cut – and continues to insist it has no policy of shutting A&Es. Denial: Care Minister Norman Lamb insisted: 'This is not about cuts or taking money away from hospitals' But NHS England has claimed that the fund will lead to a 15 per cent drop in emergency admissions after it kicks in next April, and GP-led clinical commissioning groups, which deliver services, have been asked to model ‘savings’ in their budget accordingly. They have been told to ‘clearly identify where the NHS savings will be realised’ – and will have to show where they could each make an estimated £16million worth of cuts. Organisations bidding for the fund’s cash are also required to state how they think hospital services will have been ‘reconfigured’ in five years’ time. An NHS England PowerPoint presentation reminds the applicants of the need to convince staff and the public about the benefits of ‘major service changes as a result of five-year strategy plans and the Better Care Fund’. But critics have warned that the money will simply disappear into council budgets. Doctors have also claimed that its aims – while ‘laudable’ – are wildly optimistic. Labour health spokesman Jamie Reed said: ‘David Cameron promised not to cut the NHS, but he is now raiding it to fill the holes his £2billion cuts have left in social care.’ But Care Minister Norman Lamb insisted: ‘This is not about “cuts” or taking money away from hospitals – it is about providing better joined-up care closer to home. The Better Care Fund is a major step to making this a reality.’","Plans to shut NHS hospitals could trigger a wave of A&E closures .

"Lazar Markovic scored his first league goal for Liverpool as the club prepared for the post-Gerrard era with a win that keeps alive their top-four hopes and leaves Sunderland staring at a relegation battle. Steven Gerrard’s 25-year association with Anfield is not quite over yet, but this was the first match played since official confirmation that he will leave for MLS side LA Galaxy at the end of this season and, at 34, he will certainly not be playing every game until then. As if to underline his susceptibility, he was withdrawn at half-time yesterday as a precaution with a minor hamstring ailment. Markovic, a 20-year-old Serb who cost £20million when bought from Benfica and various third parties last summer, was set up by a pass from Gerrard for the goal. The assist was symbolic as well as practical; it will be Markovic’s generation who will now be required to step up and fill the void about to be created not just by Gerrard’s technical contributions but his leadership.

Liverpool should have had a penalty before going ahead but referee Craig Pawson bafflingly failed to punish Wes Brown for bringing down Markovic. Liverpool later failed to punish 10-man Sunderland after Pawson gave a soft second yellow to Liam Bridcutt. ‘I thought we were outstanding in the first half,’ said Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers. He praised his team’s ‘control’ and ‘tempo’ and pressing game. ‘We should have had a clear penalty, we hit the crossbar and created other clear-cut chances,’ he said. Liverpool have lost just one game now in their last 13 matches in all competitions and one in nine in the Premier League. This win leaves them in eighth place, four points behind the coveted Champions League slots. They will, however, need to up their game if they are to mount a realistic challenge. Rodgers can at least look forward to returning players, with Daniel Sturridge getting closer after thigh and calf problems and Raheem Sterling due back from a mid-season holiday. Rodgers has given Sterling, 20, some time off to rest and the player has been soaking up some winter sun on holiday in Jamaica. He will be back next week. ‘In my two and a half years here, he has gone from youth team to full international,’ said Rodgers, explaining the rationale for Sterling’s break. ‘I need to think of the kid for himself and for Liverpool in the long term. It was a good time to give him a rest and he’ll be back fresh for the rest of the season.’ Rodgers also had praise for Markovic, who he insisted will have a ‘big, big future’.

This was the tenth league game of the season (out of 21) in which they have failed to score. ‘The feeling is not good,’ said manager Gus Poyet. ‘We played poorly for 45 minutes of a very important game and, when you do that against a team like Liverpool, you’ll get punished.’ He then implied criticism of referee Pawson, agreeing that ‘by the rules’ yellow cards should be handed out for certain actions that inhibit attacking play. This was a reference to Bridcutt’s second booking, a soft card for the slightest contact with Emre Can. Poyet then said that, by the rules, Liverpool’s Philippe Coutinho should also have had two yellows. ‘You referee by the rules or you referee by common sense,’ he said, implying Pawson had not used common sense.Poyet also confirmed he would try to buy a striker in the transfer window to address Sunderland’s chronic lack of goals. ‘I’ll not give too much information away,’ he said. ‘We’ll try.’ Liverpool’s goal came after a decent phase of interplay ended with Markovic running on to a ball from Gerrard and slotting past Costel Pantilimon.

"Former Polish President Lech Walesa  has demanded an eroding of borders between major nation states on the continent . An extraordinary call for Germany and Poland to unite as a single country at the new heart of Europe came yesterday from Lech Walesa, one of the key figures in the demise of the Cold War. The former Solidarity trade union leader shocked his follow Poles by demanding an eroding of borders between major nation states on the continent. We need to expand economic and defence cooperation and other structures to make from the states of Poland and Germany one state of Europe,' said the mustachioed Walesa, 70 this month, who was a staunch opponent of Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe whose historic industrial action in the Gdansk shipyards ushered in a new era freedom and democracy. 'We have gone so far in our technical advancements that we are no longer located in our own countries,' he told Russian news agency Itar-Tass. 'There is a broadening of geographical structures, while the economy and democracy should also be altered.' He insisted that the uniting of his Polish homeland which its bitter wartime enemy Germany was not only possible but the logical conclusion of his own historic role in dismantling the Iron Curtain. 'The Germans have done us a lot more evil, and the relationship we have  now is much better than that with Russia. Why?,' he asked. 'Because after the war, Germany fully confessed to all its dirty tricks. It’s necessary to say once and for all who did something evil, full stop. Until we do, the wound won’t heal.' The ex-Polish president who won the Nobel Peace Prize said:  'My struggle led to the reunification of Germany and the creation of the state of Europe. 'We destroyed the borders, globalisation is on the horizon.' The outspoken former politician said Germany 'fully confessed to all its dirty tricks' after the war - including its concentration camps in Auschwitz - so the pair could be united . Claiming the old borders no longer mattered, he said: 'This is the broadening of geographical structures, while the economy and democracy should also be altered.' Of  building new structures, he said: 'It’s Lego bricks.' Having faced down the might of one old empire - the USSR - he appeared ready in his rambling remarks to trust a new Euroland and, further still, embraced an almost utopian vision of a world without frontiers. 'Tomorrow there will be no division to Europe and Asia,' he said. 'These are old concepts that would remain only on maps. Everything will be united. Companies will be united. IT is a process of structures growing due to the technological progress. 'Right now we are stopped by obstacles of different kinds, like various kinds of disparities, different systems, but gradually we’ll be smoothing it down and the states will become like Lego bricks. 'If a state will have a good shape, it will be possible to build various kinds of structures. He insisted that the bitter wartime enemies should unite, despite the atrocities inflicted in World War II as 'globalisation is on the horizon' 'The frontiers will not be visible. Those who have bad parameters would not be able to unite with anyone. The shapes are freedom, democracy, free market, pluralism.' However, he seemed to question Russia’s ability to join this new club despite recently urging closer relations with this former enemy. 'We need to have similar shapes of those Lego bricks,' he said. 'If Russia gets the right shapes, it will be possible to work with it. 'Since Russia is a huge country, a rich country, it has the whole Mendeleev table. Everyone would want to work with it, but it has to have the right shapes so that it will be possible to build something with it.' Walesa - who called himself 'a leader by nature' - appeared to rule out a return to frontline politics.  'I am too old already,' he said. 'I’m tired.' 'This is one of Lech Walesa’s exotic ideas,' said ex-premier Jozef Oleksy. 'He has the role of someone who stimulates ideas, sometimes annoying ideas, but I don’t attach much importance to this one.'","Ex-Polish president demanded eroding borders between European states .

"A coroner is investigating the role of the violent video game Call of Duty in the deaths of up to four teenage boys who played it before killing themselves. John Pollard said that in ‘three or four inquests . . . the Call of Duty game seems to be figuring in recent activity before death’. He added: ‘It concerns me greatly. It has figured in a number of deaths which I’m investigating.’ Scroll down for video . Concerns: Speaking at the inquest into the death of schoolboy William Menzies, left coroner John Pollard said he was worried that Call of Duty had featured in this and other inquests, including that of Callum Green, right . Warning: Call of Duty (the screengrab is from CoD 4) is one of the world's most successful titles, but the coroner has warned parents not to allow their children to play adult-only titles like this one . He was speaking at the inquest of . gifted A-level student William Menzies, 16, who suffocated himself in . his bedroom, where he frequently played the war-simulation game on an . Xbox. Like other violent games such as Grand . Theft Auto, many releases in the Call of Duty series have an 18 . certificate but are often played by school-age boys. Expert: Coroner John Pollard, who presided over the inquests into the deaths of Harold Shipman's victims, says the mention of the game 'concerned him greatly' In February 2012, Callum Green, 14, . was found hanged after playing Call of Duty with his stepfather. At the . time, Mr Pollard urged parents to stop their children playing adult . video games, saying the age restriction was for a ‘valid reason’. The South Manchester coroner said Call of Duty had also been linked to the deaths of two other unnamed teenagers. William lived with his parents John, . 56, and Anne, 52, and older brother Alexander, 19, in the upmarket . village of Hale, Greater Manchester, and attended Altrincham Grammar . School. Mr Menzies said: ‘Nothing about him . caused concern. 'He was very taken with his studies and he enjoyed . playing his Xbox. 'The game he always played was Call of Duty. ‘He was rather self-contained, he didn’t like going out a great deal. 'He didn’t drink or smoke – he was the opposite to that. ‘He had exams coming up, but that . wouldn’t cause him any worry as he was a straight-A student. 'He never . threatened self-harm to my knowledge.’ Mr Menzies told the inquest that on . February 17, during the half-term holidays, he was working at home and . gave his son the science fiction novel Never Let Me Go to read. Discovery: The home of schoolboy Callum Green near Stockport, where he was found  after a family row about being 'grounded' Scary: Call of Duty has an 18 certificate and is one of the gorier video games on the market . Call of Duty allows players to inhabit the role of a blood-thirsty soldier in a variety of grusome scenarios. Gamers are armed with machine guns, rifles, pistols and grenades and play a fast-paced game of kill or be killed. Norwegian mass killer Anders Breivik claimed he had ‘trained himself’ to kill his 77 victims by playing Call of Duty. French terrorist Mohammed Merah also played Call Of Duty before killing three soldiers and four civilians – including a rabbi and three children – in Toulouse in March 2012. The violence in Call of Duty has been criticised by the London Jewish Forum, the British Muslim Forum and Church of England ministers. Call of Duty 3 shows soldiers running through London while bombs explode and buildings crash to the ground. In one controversial scene a soldier causes a Tube train to derail and explode. Other graphic scenes show aerial attacks on New York and grenades exploding in Paris and Berlin. When news of the Certificate 18 game's content was revealed it was panned by Mediawatch UK as being in 'incredibly poor taste'. Call of Duty 2 also caused outrage when it was revealed players could kill 'civilians'. There are currently at least 40million active players across all of the Call of Duty titles. ‘On one occasion I heard William laughing in his bedroom,’ he said. His wife sounded the alert later that afternoon when she went to check on their son, and the family tried to resuscitate him. An ambulance came to the family’s home within ten minutes and rushed him to hospital, but he was later pronounced dead. Mr Menzies said: ‘I would say William . is a person who made his own mind up and carried things out, so . . . I . would say that there is clear suggestion he intended it. ‘He was happy that day and the last . thing I heard him do was laugh, so I could only guess as to why he might . have done it, but there is no doubt he intended to take his life.’ William’s brother Alexander said: ‘I . remember him saying he had admiration for a philosopher who had decided . to kill himself. 'He never said he was going to harm himself. During that . day, at lunchtime, the two of us were making lunch together. He seemed . cheery and in a good mood.’ Recording a verdict of suicide, Mr . Pollard said: ‘I suspect, but I don’t know because I don’t have enough . evidence, that William may have been experimenting with something or . deliberately intending. ‘There is no doubt it was asphyxia. There was no note or indication he was feeling down or distressed.’ Mr Pollard recorded an open verdict at . the inquest into the death of Callum, who was found hanged in his . bedroom after being grounded by his mother following a row.

"A father took his two young sons who are fans of war games to Israel and Syria to a dramatic bid to teach them about the harsh realities of war and the devastation caused by the use of guns. Carl-Magnus Helgegren is a Swedish journalist, university teacher, and a father of two boys, Leo, 11 and Frank, 10. Mr Helgegren told MailOnline that was inspired to take his sons on the trip after they asked if they could buy the new violent shooter game when they were eating dinner last year and he became concerned that they did not understand the impact of war.

"Simpsons producer Al Jean has more or less confirmed that Krusty the Clown will be killed off on the show’s September 29 season premiere. There has been speculation for months about just who will get the chop after Jean revealed during a publicity tour last year that a major character would be written out of the show. At the time he said: ‘'I'll give you a clue that the actor playing the character won an Emmy for playing that character, but I won't say who it is.’ No more clowning around: It seems that Krusty will make his last appearance on The Simpsons in September . Acclaimed: Krusty the Clown's rasping voice comes courtesy of Dan Castellaneta (left), while strong hints about the character's demise came from Executive Producter Al Jean (right) It wasn’t much of a clue considering that almost all of the actors who supplied voices for the main Simpsons characters have taken home Emmys. But at a Television Critics Association panel on Sunday on Fox, Jean all but confirmed that the caustic clown is the character that’s in the writers’ cross-hairs. He said that the episode in which the character died would be called A Clown In The Dumps, which drew gasps from the audience. There is, however, a chance that the character being axed is Krusty’s father, Rabbi Hyman Krustofski, voiced by Jackie Mason, or Sideshow Bob, voiced by Kelsey Grammer, as they have both won Grammys for their voice work. He added: ‘It’s a terrific character and it [happens in] our premiere this coming year.' Idol: Bart Simpson (left) is a huge fan of Krusty the Clown . Dan Castellaneta, who voices Krusty, told the Archive of American Television that the character is a chance for the writers to 'take shots at comedians or TV shows they've written for, so they can put it all into Krusty'. Even though he presents a kiddy show, Castellaneta said, 'he's been compared to Jackie Gleason... the old time comics, who've got to have everything done just right, but also steeped in Jewish showbusiness'. He added: 'For a while they tried to do Krusty out of his make-up, but then they said ""just leave him in make-up all of the time"". The original idea, he said, was that 'Bart idolised Krusty and Matt [Groening] designed him to look like Homer and he was going to do something where it turned out that Homer really was Krusty and he abandoned that very quickly'. Castellanesta explained that the idea is that 'Bart subconsciously idolises Homer, but he can't really, so he does it through this kiddy show host'. The season, which premieres in the U.S. in September, is the show's 26th. In 2009 it surpassed Gunsmoke as the longest running primetime television show. Since its debut in 1989 it has broadcast 552 episodes. Following Jean's announcement about the title of the first episode of the new season, bookmaker Paddy Power slashed the odds of Krusty the Clown being axed from 14/1 to just 3/1. Paddy Power has Sideshow Bob as favourite to kill Krusty, with odds of 7/2 that he'll do the deed. As to how Krusty goes, Paddy Power has priced up a few possibilities, with the outsider option being death by doughnut at 33/1 - and dying while saving Bart's life the most likely at 3/1. A circus accident gets odds of 5/1, crushed by a piano 8/1, frightened to death 12/1 and being run over by Homer 12/1.","There has been much speculation about a Simpsons character being axed .

"Plans: Mark David Chapman said a minister in upstate New York offered him a place to live and work if he had been granted parole . The killer of famed Beatle John Lennon was denied release from prison for the seventh time, appearing once again before a parole board yesterday. Mark David Chapman, 57, was denied parole by a three-member board after a hearing Wednesday, the state Department of Corrections said Thursday. The transcript of his latest hearing wasn't immediately released. Chapman shot Lennon in December 1980 outside the Manhattan apartment building where the former Beatle lived, and was sentenced in 1981 to 20 years to life in prison after pleading guilty to second-degree murder. The musician, singer and songwriter was 40. Chapman . was transferred in May from the Attica Correctional Facility in western . New York to the nearby Wende Correctional Facility. Both are maximum . security. However, the prison system doesn't disclose why inmates are . transferred. Throughout the . decades, Chapman’s wife Gloria Hiroko Chapman has paid her husband . regular visits and will now be allowed conjugal visits in a trailer . complete with kitchenette, living room, and two bedrooms – without . cameras, as part of a deal Chapman made. Fated meeting: John Lennon signs Mark Chapman's copy of Double Fantasy outside the Dakota Building in 1980, hours before Chapman opened fire on the former Beatle and killed him . Scene of the crime: Lennon lived at the Dakota Apartments on Manhattan's Upper West Side; there is now a plaque commemorating where the musician was shot . Gloria married her . notorious husband in 1979, one year before he shot the Beatles star . outside his apartment building in New York City. Young: Chapman was 25 when he murdered Lennon, and is seen in a December 9, 1980 booking photo . The 57-year-old Chapman requested that he be allowed conjugal visits with his wife in his current prison - which would take place in a trailer devoid of guards and cameras. The request was granted earlier this week. According to the New York Daily News, Chapman had participated in the so-called 'family reunion' program when he was an inmate at the maximum-security Attica Correctional Facility. When he was transferred in May to Wende state prison in Genesee County - also a maximum security prison, he had to reapply for the privilege. State prison system spokesman Peter Cutle said: 'He followed the standard procedures and protocols in our system, and his request for participation was approved.' The program allows Chapman to be allowed to spend up to 48 hours in a trailer with his wife on prison grounds - which has a kitchenette, living room and two bedrooms. It is free of prison guards and cameras. Hopelessly devoted: Gloria Chapman, pictured at her quiet home in Hawaii, married Mark in 1979, a year before the murder, and frequently visits him . His stepfather will also be able to visit. Mr Cutler said of the program: 'We know it has beneficial impact on the inmate both for their behavior on the inside and for their eventual reentry into society.' Gloria, a Japanese-American and former travel agent, married Chapman in Hawaii in June 1979, 18 months before he gunned down Lennon while he was signing an autograph for him. According to the New York Daily News, who interviewed Mrs Chapman in 2008 at her single-story, bluish-gray house in the Honolulu suburb of Kailua, the couple have been enjoying these conjugal visits for the last 20 years. She now works in a hospital in the quiet town of Kailua, 15 miles from Honolulu, and lives in the hospital-owned property across the street with two other women. Concealed: A day after the 1980 murder, Mark David Chapman, centre, is escorted out of police station with a jacket covering his face and head . Reaction: Lennon's distraught fans gathered outside his apartment building on December 8, after he was gunned down . Widow's grief: Yoko Ono, centre, pictured in 2005 visiting Strawberry Fields, has requested that Chapman not be granted parole in an email to the New York Department of Corrections . At his previous hearing, he recalled that he had considered shooting Johnny Carson or Elizabeth Taylor instead, and said again that he chose Lennon because the ex-Beatle was more accessible. He said that his century-old Upper West Side apartment building by Central Park 'wasn't quite as cloistered.' Chapman fired five shots outside the . Dakota apartment house on December 8, 1980, hitting Lennon four times in . front of his wife, Yoko Ono, and others. The . former security guard from Hawaii said that his motivation was instant . notoriety but that he later realized he made a horrible decision for . selfish reasons. 'I felt that by killing John Lennon I . would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and . murderers are not somebodies.' -Mark David Chapman . 'I felt that by killing John Lennon I would become somebody and instead of that I became a murderer and murderers are not somebodies,' Chapman told the board two years ago. Ono, 79, had said two years ago that she was trying to be 'practical' in asking that her husband's killer remain behind bars. She said Chapman might be a danger to her, other family members and perhaps even himself. In . a 1992 interview at Attica, Chapman told Barbara Walters that it was . dark when he shot Lennon in the back with a .38-caliber revolver after . he exited a limousine, headed up the walkway to his apartment building . and looked at Chapman. 'I . heard this voice - not an audible voice, an inaudible voice - saying . over and over, `Do it, do it, do it,'' Chapman said. He explained, 'I . thought that by killing him I would acquire his fame.' He has been in protective custody with a good disciplinary record, according to corrections officials. Let me take you down: Strawberry Fields, located in Central Park near the Dakota Apartments, serves as a gathering point for fans and those wishing to pay their respects .","Mark Chapman has been in prison for 31-years after killing the former Beatle in December 1980 in front of Lennon's Upper West Side apartment .

Valdes leaps in a crowded penalty area to claim the ball during a Champions League clash with Man City . DEFENDERS . Marc Muniesa (Stoke City) Barcelona 2002-2013 . The defender was the second youngest player to feature for Barca's first team when he played against Osasuna in May 2009 at the tender age of 17 years and 57 days. Despite such a promising start, he was unable to break into Pep Guardiola's side on a regular basis, playing mainly for the B side in the lower leagues. Sensing his chance was unlikely to come, Muniesa joined Stoke City on a free transfer in July 2013, linking up with another former Barcelona player, Mark Hughes. Marc Muniesa celebrates after scoring for Stoke City against Sunderland in the Capital One Cup . Hector Bellerin (Arsenal) Barcelona 2003-2011 . The attack-minded left-back has shot to prominence this season with his first appearances in Arsene Wenger's first team - but he learned his craft at Barcelona. Born in the city, Bellerin spent eight years at the club before switching to Arsenal's academy in 2011, signing his first professional contract two years later. Hector Bellerin, the former Barcelona youth product now at Arsenal, competes against Aston Villa . Damia Abella (Middlesbrough) Barcelona 2004-2006 . Abella has been unfortunate with injuries since his arrival at Middlesbrough and has been restricted to just half-a-dozen appearances in Aitor Karanka's side. He played for Barcelona a decade ago though was never able to break into the first team squad and spent much of his two years at Camp Nou in the B team. After leaving there, he forged a successful career with Racing Santander, Real Betis and Osasuna before arriving in the north-east. Ignasi Miquel (Norwich City) Barcelona 1999-2004 . The Barcelona-born defender spent five years in the La Masia academy between the ages of seven and 12 before being released to lower league club Cornella. He switched to Arsenal's academy in 2008 and made a handful of first-team appearances in the 2011-12 and 2012-13 seasons. But further opportunities didn't materialise and, following a loan spell at Leicester City, Miquel arrived at Norwich in the summer of 2014. Defender Ignasi Miquel in action for Arsenal's Under 21 side back in 2011. He now plays for Norwich . MIDFIELDERS . Cesc Fabregas (Chelsea) Barcelona 1997-2003; 2011-2014 . A local lad and Barcelona fan from birth, Fabregas joined their La Masia academy at the age of 10 alongside the likes of Lionel Messi and Gerard Pique. Despite scoring regularly for the youth teams, he sensed his first-team breakthrough would be a long time coming and signed for Arsenal in September 2003. There, he quickly progressed to the first team and matured to one of the best midfielders in the world. He was a World Cup-winner by the time he returned to Barcelona in 2011, for a fee in the region of £30m. Spent three seasons alongside the likes of Xavi and Iniesta in the midfield before coming to Chelsea.

Yaya Toure (Manchester City) Barcelona 2007-2010 . The powerful Ivorian joined Barcelona from Monaco in 2007 and soon established himself as Barcelona's midfield rock upon which their creative players could depend. He made 117 appearances over three seasons and helped Barca to two Liga titles, the Copa del Rey and the Champions League in 2009. His departure to Manchester City in 2010 disappointed many Barca fans but Toure has gone from strength to strength in the Premier League. Yaya Toure holds off Cristiano Ronaldo in Barcelona's 2009 Champions League win over Manchester United . Toure celebrates scoring for Manchester City in their home match with Sunderland this season . Mikel Arteta (Arsenal) Barcelona 1997-2002 . Given his subsequent success in the Premier League, it's often forgotten that Arteta started out at Barcelona. He joined their academy from Basque club Antiguoko in 1997 and despite appearances for the C team and the B team he was never quite able to make that next step. His career began to flourish when on loan at Paris Saint-Germain, then at Rangers before he developed into the talented midfielder he is today. Mikel Arteta celebrates scoring a penalty against Anderlecht in the Champions League group stage . Alex Song (West Ham on loan) Barcelona 2012- . Cameroonian midfielder Song is on loan at West Ham from Barcelona for this season and has been in excellent form. After six years at Arsenal, Barca splashed out £15m to bring him to Catalonia in 2012. Song has to date made 65 appearances for the club, winning La Liga in 2013. Song during his Barcelona days on the ball during a Clasico meeting with Real Madrid . Song holds off the challenge of Manchester City's Jesus Navas during a match for West Ham this season . Jordi Gomez (Sunderland) Barcelona 2003-2007 . The central midfielder's football education occurred mainly at Barcelona though it was their city neighbours Espanyol who gave him his professional debut. While there, he spent a highly-successful season on loan at Swansea City, helping establish them as a Championship club under Roberto Martinez. Gomez stayed in England, joining Wigan on a permanent basis and proved instrumental in their unexpected FA Cup triumph in 2013. He joined Sunderland last year. Jordi Gomez in action for Sunderland during their FA Cup replay at Fulham on Tuesday night . Jon Toral (Brentford on loan from Arsenal) Barcelona 2003-2011 . Toral was scouted while playing for youth side Santes Creus and joined Barcelona at the age of eight. He forged a successful midfield partnership with Sergi Samper and they played together for eight years in the youth ranks. He caught the eye of Arsenal while playing in the Manchester United Premier Cup of 2010 and they signed him alongside Bellerin a year later. Although yet to make a first-team appearance for the Gunners, 20-year-old Toral is spending a year on loan at Brentford in the Championship to gain experience. Jon Toral seen in action for Arsenal during a pre-season friendly against Boreham Wood last summer . Andrea Orlandi (Blackpool) Barcelona 2005-2007 . Attacking midfielder Orlandi hails from Barcelona but only made one first-team appearance for the club during a loan spell there from Basque side Alaves in the mid-noughties. His greatest achievements came in Britain, where he helped Swansea into the Premier League and also played for Brighton before joining Blackpool. Andrea Orlandi celebrates scoring a goal against Newcastle United during his days at Brighton . FORWARDS . Alexis Sanchez (Arsenal) Barcelona 2011-2014 . The Chilean had been impressive for Udinese, forming a highly-productive partnership with Italy striker Antonio Di Natale. His performances persuaded Barcelona to pay £25m for him in the summer of 2011 but despite being one of the best on the planet, he wasn't guaranteed a place in Barca's front line. Nonetheless, Alexis scored 47 times in 141 appearances for the club during his three seasons there before leaving for Arsenal, where he has so far been exceptional. Despite being one of the best players of his type in the world, Sanchez wasn't guaranteed a spot at Barca . Stylish Sanchez has been a revelation in the Premier League since his switch to Arsenal last summer . Bojan Krkic (Stoke City) Barcelona 1999-2011 . Before a serious knee injury that could rule him out for three months, Bojan was enjoying an encouraging first season with Stoke City following his move from Barca last summer. He had been a major fixture in the side having emerged from the academy in 2007, winning three La Liga titles and two Champions League crowns, but the opportunities slowly dwindled. In three unsettled years before arriving at Stoke he went to Roma, then Milan on loan, then back to Barcelona, and then immediately out to Ajax. Bojan Krkic celebrates a goal for Barcelona during his heyday at the club in 2010 . Bojan has started to recapture some of his best form since moving to Stoke in the Premier League . Eidur Gudjohnsen (Bolton Wanderers) Barcelona 2006-2009 . The former Iceland international has played in quite a few places across Europe, including three years at Barcelona between 2006 and 2009. Signed for about £9m from Chelsea to replace Henrik Larsson, he didn't have a particularly prolific scoring record, with just 18 in 112 outings. He did, however, help Barcelona win the Champions League in 2009, becoming the first from his country to do so.

"Joe Tuftnell was not convinced when his doctors told him that the best course of treatment for his early-stage prostate cancer was to do nothing. Instead, the retired IBM engineer went to Prague to have the tumour destroyed by proton beam therapy, a cutting-edge intervention not available on the NHS. Joe, 70, a grandfather of three who lives with wife Vanessa, 67, in Andover, Hants, was diagnosed last April. A routine blood test by his GP revealed his level of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) had risen. Joe Tuftnell, photographed at his home in Hampshire, Went abroad for prostate cancer treatment . PSA is produced by the prostate gland - raised levels can mean the gland has developed a cancerous growth. A biopsy confirmed the diagnosis and Joe was told by his hospital consultant that the cancer could be managed with 'active surveillance'. While this might sound like doing nothing, in fact it involves closely monitoring the tumour - usually with PSA tests and digital rectal examinations every three to six months, and repeat prostate biopsies every few years. If tests show the cancer is growing, doctors may give treatment such as surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy. 'Active surveillance' is offered to men with less aggressive prostate cancer to avoid or put off unnecessary treatment that has potentially serious side-effects. The prostate is a chestnut-size gland that sits below the bladder and around the urethra. Next to it are nerves and blood vessels that are essential for proper erectile and bladder function. Pictured with his wife Vanessa. He paid £16,000 for the procedure . Radiation can damage these nerves and blood vessels - half of prostate cancer patients given conventional radiotherapy were impotent after two years, according to a study published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. About 4 per cent of men are left with serious urinary incontinence. Surgery can also damage the nerves and blood vessels. Joe 'could not see the point of waiting for the condition to worsen' but the alternatives didn't appeal, either. 'They meant I faced a considerable risk of impotence and incontinence,' he says. Then last year he was visiting a friend in Prague when he saw a newspaper article about the Prague Proton Therapy Centre, which offers proton beam therapy. Unlike conventional radiotherapy, which relies on high-intensity X-rays, this bombards tumours with protons, the hearts of atoms. The millimetre-accurate treatment is claimed to be less destructive to surrounding tissue and so less likely to cause side-effects. Furthermore, the physical characteristics of protons mean they are not absorbed into the tissue they pass through, so they don't damage it while killing the tumour. 'The success rates were the same as conventional treatments offered in the UK,' says Joe. 'While there was no guarantee I'd not suffer side-effects, the chances looked promising.' Doctors in Prague said the operation would cost £16,000. Had his cancer been at an advanced stage, it could have cost up to £29,000. Joe raided his life savings and had the procedure last June. After he had been given an MRI and CT scan, surgeons inserted three small gold grains into his prostate to enable the beam to target the tumour safely. He lay in a body mould that held him absolutely straight, so his prostate did not move while the beam was targeted; then he was wheeled into the radiation room. The procedure took only a minute and a half. 'They sent the beam in from one side of my body, then the other,' he remembers. 'There was no pain or discomfort - I left the hospital within an hour of arriving.' This process was repeated four times, every second day. 'My NHS consultant was initially concerned about what I'd done,' Joe says. 'But the outcome has been brilliant. My PSA has dropped from 7 to 1.8 and I'm living a normal life.' The Prague clinic claims it receives daily inquiries from British men about being treated for prostate cancer. So far, all the British patients it has treated have funded their care themselves. This month it was reported that Peter Kysel, a retired British banker who went to Prague for proton therapy, was planning to send his £17,000 bill to the NHS in the hope of taking advantage of a law that gives patients the right to be treated anywhere in the European Union (if that treatment is considered appropriate). But why is this treatment not available in the UK? All the British patients the Prague clinic has treated have funded their care themselves . art of the problem is the cost of proton therapy technology - about £125 million per machine. But doctors here also say there is a lack of robust clinical evidence to prove its worth conclusively over conventional radiotherapy. Last August, the Government confirmed that £250 million would be made available to build two UK proton therapy centres - one at The Christie Hospital in Manchester, the other at University College Hospital in London. Both are due to open in 2018. But Cancer Research UK says the centres will not be treating men with prostate cancer. 'They will be focusing their time and energy on childhood cancers and rare adult cancers,' says Kat Arney, the charity's science information manager. Proton therapy has many benefits over conventional treatment for these cancers. Rare adult cancers, such as those at the base of the skull or spine, can be hard to tackle without damaging surrounding nerves, and conventional radiotherapy can be particularly harmful for children, whose bodies and brains are still developing. The NHS sends 80 such patients a year abroad to have proton therapy, and treating them in the UK should save money in the long term, says Kat Arney. But in prostate cancer, the evidence so far for proton therapy's increased benefits is considered too marginal to justify the cost. The Proton Therapy Centre claims the treatment dramatically cuts the risk of life-changing side-effects, such as impotence. 'As far as we can tell, the incidence of impotence is about 30  per cent for people who have proton beam therapy, compared with about 60 per cent for conventional treatment,' says Mike Cullen, the UK representative for the centre. These results have not been independently verified. But the good news is that a British firm is developing new, cheaper proton-therapy equipment. London-based Advanced Oncotherapy is working with physicists at the European Centre for Nuclear Research (Cern), the scientists who developed the Large Hadron Collider. It says its new machines will fit into one room rather than occupying a whole purpose-built facility. They cost around £26 million per machine, less than a quarter of the price of the two competitors.Advanced Oncotherapy is proposing to install proton beam therapy units in ten UK hospitals and clinics in the next five years. Christopher Nutting, professor of radiotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Institute of Cancer Research, and a non-executive director of Advanced Oncotherapy, says: 'We should be cautious about the claims being made for proton therapy. 'In the U.S., private care providers are making all sorts of spurious claims for it.' However, he is quietly hopeful. 'Any form of radiation therapy where you can be more accurate is potentially a beneficial advance. The Advanced Oncotherapy machine might enable us to get much cheaper proton treatment.'Until then, patients such as Joe Tuftnell must choose between paying for proton therapy and having what's available here.","Joe Tuftnell, 70, from Andover, Hants, was told to do nothing about cancer .

"Half a million people will be left 20 miles from their nearest A&E under ‘deeply worrying’ plans to cut two neighbouring casualty units. The imminent threats are to the A&Es in Milton Keynes and Bedford, which between them serve at least 500,000 people in an area with a fast-growing population. GPs have drawn up the cost-cutting plans as they face a £30 million black hole in their NHS finances. The A&E in Milton Keynes is facing closure in 'crazy' plans to help plug a £30 million hole in NHS finances . If both units close, emergency patients will have to go to Northampton, Kettering or Luton for life-saving treatment. All are at least 20 miles away from both towns. For the past two years The Mail on Sunday has been fighting to save A&Es from closure. The latest threats mean there are now 16 units across England facing the axe. Both A&Es could close next year, despite warnings from Simon Stevens, new chief executive of the NHS, that England’s emergency services are already ‘quite concentrated’ and they should not be cut from ‘viable local hospitals’ without very careful thought. Last night, politicians and health campaigners condemned the plans. Andrew Pakes, Labour’s prospective parliamentary candidate for Milton Keynes South, said: ‘I’ve never seen the NHS under so much pressure here. Right now we are in the middle of a summer A&E crisis in Milton Keynes, with record numbers turning up. Any plan to downgrade A&E services here or in Bedford is absolutely crazy. ‘Milton Keynes is one of the fastest growing areas in the country, and within ten years it will be the biggest urban area in the South East outside London. They should be expanding, not downgrading.’ He believed forcing sick patients to travel so far for emergency treatment would be ‘deeply worrying’. Jayne Beard, of the Bedford Hospitals Charity, said she was ‘absolutely devastated’ to hear the town could lose its A&E, adding: ‘It can easily take 45 minutes to get to Northampton or Luton in the rush hour. That’s not funny if you’re in immediate need of medical attention.’ But she vowed: ‘People won’t give up easily. We will fight.’ The Bedford A&E pictured and Milton Keynes are just two of 16 units across England facing the axe . The proposals are outlined in a new public document drawn up by Bedfordshire and Milton Keynes’s clinical commissioning groups (CCGs), the local NHS authorities that pay a large chunk of the hospitals’ bills. The GPs who run the groups have outlined 14 scenarios for the two hospitals. Only three involve both hospitals retaining full A&Es. Eight involve one hospital retaining its A&E and the other’s being downgraded to either an ‘integrated care hub’ or an ‘urgent care centre’. The latter would have no beds for emergency patients. Elsewhere, some urgent care centres deal with only minor injuries at night. The remaining three options would see both A&Es closed. The GPs have pitched their plans as letting ‘the public have their say on ideas for health services’. But even before consultation begins this autumn, they have effectively ruled out retaining both A&Es, stating that ‘sustaining emergency surgery on both sites is not sustainable’. Experts say there is no point having an A&E without being able to do emergency surgery, so both almost always get stripped out at the same time. At the moment both hospitals are classed as ‘major emergency centres’. A spokesman for the review said there were simply too few people in the area to justify keeping such a service at both hospitals – since guidelines suggest each of them alone requires a catchment area of about 500,000 people to be ‘clinically viable’. According to the Milton Keynes and Bedfordshire CCGs, the NHS in the area has a ‘spending gap’  of £30 million and growing. The group wants to spend more on GP and community services to keep people out of hospital longer – but to pay for that they need to cut hospital services. Downgrading Bedford’s A&E and stripping it of most emergency services is thought to be the most likely option.","Half a million people will be left 20 miles from nearest A&E under new cuts .

"A galaxy of stars have spoken out against Scottish independence as a major ‘lovebombing’ campaign was launched ahead of the referendum. British celebrities from the world of television and sport joined forces for the ‘Let’s Stay Together’ drive, which aims to persuade Scots to vote No in September. The line-up included former soap stars Ross Kemp, Michelle Collins and Tracey Brabin and TV presenters Trinny and Susannah, Fiona Phillips, June Sarpong and The One Show’s ‘history hunter’ Dan Snow. Comedian Eddie Izzard joined a new 'lovebombing' campaign to convince Scots to reject independence in September . Actors Ross Kemp and John Barrowman hold up signs in the video urging Scots: 'Don't leave us' One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson adapts his 'I don't believe it' catchphrase to illustrate his faith in the Union . Blackadder actor Tony Robinson, One Foot in the Grave star Richard Wilson and Homeland’s David Harewood also declared their support for the Union, and they were joined by well-known pro-UK supporters Eddie Izzard and John Barrowman. From the sporting world, the campaign has won the backing of Welsh rugby legend Gareth Edwards, Liverpool icon Ian Rush, and multiple Gold-medal winning Paralympian Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson. Campaigner Baroness Doreen Lawrence, the mother of murdered teenager Stephen Lawrence, also appears in a video for Let’s Stay Together. Created by two London-based PR gurus, the campaign has adopted Queen’s You’re My Best Friend as its anthem, and encourages people across the UK to contact their friends and family north of the Border. It has even suggested a playlist of songs that supporters can listen to on their MP3 players, including We Are Family by Sister Sledge, Let’s Stick Together by Bryan Ferry and Stay By Me by Annie Lennox. Ross Kemp said his passion for the Union was fuelled by the time he spent a month with the Argylls in Musa Qala in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. “The Let’s Stay Together campaign is badly needed as it gives all of us in the rest of the UK a chance to be heard,” he said. “I think we are so entwined in each other, we are together and have always been together in many, many ways. So Scotland, please stay with us. Don’t leave us – we love you.” Fiona Phillips said: “I very much feel British - my husband’s Scottish, my mum was welsh, my dad’s a Yorkshire man. We’re a wonderful mixed family, we’re a dysfunctional family at times, aren’t we all? If independence does happen, then I think we’re all going to realise that we were much better off together.” TV presenters Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine hide behind their placard declaring: 'We love you Scotland' TV presenter June Sarpong and campaigner Baroness Doreen Lawrence also appear in the film . Fashion gurus Trinny and Susannah said: “We want to see Scotland – and the hugely lovely Scottish people – stay with us. It’s so right for us all to be together. We know some people in Scotland think that those in the rest of the UK don’t care, but it’s so very, very wrong. Everyone all over Britain cares passionately about Scotland.” Tony Robinson, who starred as Baldrick in the iconic Blackadder series and is a well-known Labour supporter, said: “As English people we have to realise [the referendum] will have an enormous impact on us. If we were cut off from Scotland it would be to the disadvantage of both countries.” Comedian Eddie Izzard, another Labour supporter, pleaded ‘Scotland, please don’t go’ and Scots-American actor and singer John Barrowman said: “I’m very proud of my Scottish heritage. My firm belief is Scotland should remain part of Great Britain.” TV presenter Fiona Phillips said 'Scotland is part of my family' in the video, aimed at persuading voters to reject independence in September's referendum . Fellow Doctor Who star David Harewood, more widely known for playing CIA counterrorism center deputy director David Estes in Homeland, said: “This great relationship that we’ve had and the hours of laughter up in Scotland… it’s part of who we are, it’s part of our identity.” Dan Snow, son of former BBC election night star Peter Snow, added: “I know I’ve got the wrong accent, I know I’m not from Scotland, but I’m just desperate to do something, anything, to stand up and say I think we’re better together. Let’s give this a chance. Don’t break-up what’s been a fantastically successful partnership.” The campaign has been set up by up by Andrew McGuinness, founder of PR firm BMB, and Scots-born MT (Mary Teresa) Rainey, founder of creative agency RKCR. Organisers said a list of donors will be reported in due course to the Electoral Commission. Mr McGuinness said: “As the Yes/No campaigns battle it out on Scottish turf, the views of people in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have largely gone unheard. “We also feel that the time has come for the whole of the UK to wake up to the break-up of Britain, and to show Scotland that we do care.”","Celebrities from TV and sport join forces for the ‘Let’s Stay Together’ drive .

"A rugby player believed to have Britain's biggest feet is unable to play for his club side because he cannot find a pair of boots that fit him. Carl Griffiths, 22, has worn out his last pair of boots playing for Trimsaran rugby club, near Llanelli, south Wales, and cannot find a suitable new pair for his size 21 feet. He has been taking to the field in size 18 boots for the past three years with his toes curled up in the ends. But after keeping them together with black sticky tape, they have finally fallen apart. Scroll down for video . The 22-year-old has to import specially made trainers from the US which costs £100 because of his huge feet . Carl Griffiths had been squeezing his feet in to size 18 Mizuno boots - but they have finally fallen apart . Standing at six foot eight, his club miss him on the pitch, especially in the line-outs. But all of the contacted sports clubs say they simply do not make boots as big as a size 21. One specialist large-size shoe website stocks Canterbury and Gilbert rugby boots up to size 15 — still three sizes smaller than the ill-fitting boots he had already been wearing, and six sizes smaller than his actual shoe size. His club are now appealing for help to find a new pair of boots that fit. Mr Griffiths, who lives in Carmarthenshire, West Wales, said: 'I'm hoping someone can help out because of how frustrating it is. 'Not being able to play because of not having shoes is just aggravating. 'At least when you have an injury, you know you just can't play for a while. But when I'm out just because of not having shoes that fit, it's just really frustrating. I just want to play rugby. 'I've had some boots in size 18, I wore them with my toes curled right up, but I broke a toe when someone stepped on it. 'The boots I have had haven't really fit properly for a long time. 'I've played a few games with broken boots taped up over the holes, and I've been doing some of the training sessions wearing my normal trainers, but I end up spending more time on the floor than I do in the game. Trimsaran Rugby club have been taking to Twitter to appeal for help to find a pair of boots for their player . An appeal has been launched by his club - Trimsaran rugby near Llanelli - to find him a new pair of boots . It is believed his enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia . Rugby boots are only available on websites up to size 15 - which is six sizes smaller than Mr Griffiths' feet . 'All the boot companies we've asked say they just don't make them that big. 'I did get a quote from one company to specially make me a pair, but it would cost well over £300. 'I have had times when I've had to take time out from rugby before and tried other sports, but it's rugby that I really want to play.' It is believed Mr Griffiths' enormous feet are the result of drugs he was given to combat childhood leukaemia. He was eight years old when doctors discovered he was suffering from the disease, and after a course of chemotherapy he was treated with steroids to help him regain his strength. His feet sprouted within a year of stopping steroid treatment at 13 after he was given the all-clear, which is unusual because steroids usually restrict growth.","Carl Griffiths, 22, cannot find a pair of rugby boots for his size 21 feet .

Part of the couple's obvious . commitment to each other is the way they have made the White House a . family home where their daughters Sasha and Malia can lead a relatively . normal life. Mrs Obama said: 'We both try to make . the home a sanctuary. Our daughters are there and they dominate the . conversations.' The couple are fiercely protective of their daughters' privacy, refusing to be drawn on whether 15-year-old Malia dates. While they admitted that she 'can . date' they refused to discover her 'private business' and said only that . she 'does what normal teenagers do'. The Obamas have converted former . guest quarters on the third floor of the White House into a room where . the girls can hold slumber parties, with the President saying: 'There's a . lot of giggling behind closed doors. I have no idea what's going on.' Their daughters will also continue to . have an impact on future decisions the family make, with Obama saying . that whether they choose to return to Chicago at the end of his . presidency will depend on what Sasha, who will be a sophomore, wants. Obama said he is grateful for Americans on Thanksgiving who are doing everything they can 'to make it' 'Sasha has a big vote in returning to . Chicago. Michelle and the girls sacrificed a lot for my cockimany idea . of running for office.' When asked whether he would remain in politics, Mrs Obama interrupted her husband, with a definite 'No'. 'I've run my last campaign,' the . President said, adding that although he would no longer be an elected . official he would continue to care about his issues. The couple said they had their first glimpse of their future over the summer, when their girls were at camp and they were home alone with just the dogs for company. Bo and Sunny, two Portuguese Water Dogs, are a big part of the family, with the first lady admitting, much to Obama's shock, that when her husband is away, she lets Bo share her bed. When Walters reminded Obama he had . said he wanted to be a good one-term President rather than a mediocre . second-term, and asked which he though he was the President said: 'I'm . shooting for a good second-term President. In your second-term you are . mindful you only have a little time left.' Obama has call his wife Michelle his 'rock' and calls his family a 'safe haven' The Obamas meet protesters fasting for immigration reform in a tent on the Washingon Mall . Obama is just as committed to his . role as president. 'I continue to believe and [I'm] absolutely convinced . that at the end of the day, people are going to look back at the work . we've done to make sure that in this country, you don't go bankrupt when . you get sick, that families have that security,' the president . said about the Affordable Healthcare Act. 'That is going be a legacy I am extraordinarily proud of,' he said. During the interview he also predicted that the U.S. would soon have its first female president. 'We have some amazing female [public] servants all across the country and there is no doubt that sometime very soon, we're going to have a female president,' he said. 'I'm confident that she will do a great job.' Walters asked Obama if he thought his wife would do a better job as president than he would. He responded, 'that's an easy question, but she is smart enough to know that she might not want to go through the process.' The first lady said that she didn't have the 'patience' her husband has. In a message to the hard-working Americans, Obama said: 'Every day I'm going be working as hard as I can on your behalf ... For all the challenges and all the polarization of our politics and the frustrations of Washington, this remains and will remain the greatest country on Earth.'","'I was re-elected because people think I'm trustworthy' President says .

He said: 'It would be a tough call to be like, ""The weather is changing, we're just going to go completely throw a dart in the dark and hope it hits."" We had to stick with what we knew. 'In hindsight, it was a mistake, because on training day, it was boilerplate ice and you needed a lot of edge. And on race day, you needed to be more subtle, more smooth' Austrian ski jumper Wilhelm Denifl said: 'Holes and ruts form if the snow on the landing zone is not hard enough... The snow becomes unstable, and if we are landing consistently in the same area, and at a high speed, the pressure associated with landing can make it unstable. And dangerous.'

Conditions must be as perfect as possible and start slipping when the temperature gets anywhere above freezing. SLOPESTYLE: .

"Around an hour before kick-off in the north London derby, Daniel Levy will welcome a delegation of Arsenal officials into his spacious boardroom at White Hart Lane. The conversation with Arsenal’s chief executive Ivan Gazidis will be polite and cordial, barely scratching the surface before Levy sits down for pre-match brunch with a table full of Tottenham executives. Later this month, when David Sullivan, David Gold and Karren Brady walk up the stairs of the West Stand on February 22, the atmosphere will be a little bit more chilly. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy relishes the negotiating battle that comes with player transfers . Levy blocked a  loan move for striker Emmanuel Adebayor to rivals West Ham United on deadline day . Levy's  tactics when talking to West Ham irked Hammers executives David Gold and Karen Brady (right) West Ham are tired of Levy, irritated by his negotiating tactics on transfer deadline day after he refused to allow Emmanuel Adebayor to move to Upton Park. They are in no rush to deal with him again. Levy has an extraordinary reputation within the game and he is always willing to come to the table in the transfer window, so long as the terms are in Tottenham’s favour. As one owner of a Barclays Premier League club told Sportsmail in the aftermath of deadline day: ‘Daniel likes to squeeze your balls until your eyes start to water’. Levy comes alive in the window, spending hours on the phone to a network of agents. Leon Angel, plus Gareth Bale’s representative Jonathan Barnett and his assistant David Manessah are all on speed dial as he plots Tottenham’s next move. Levy was anointed by Tottenham’s principal owner Joe Lewis, who is also his godfather, when his investment vehicle ENIC bought the club from Sir Alan Sugar in 2001. All three are ruthless businessmen. Gold sent out a cryptic tweet after West Ham were unable to secure the arrival of striker Adebayor . Levy (right) was given his role at Tottenham by principal owner Joe Lewis who is his godfather . GARETH BALE . Signed from Southampton for £7m and . sold to Real Madrid for £86m.

LUKA MODRIC . Signed from Dinamo Zagreb for £16.5m . and sold to Real Madrid for £33m. £16.5m 100% . He is at the training ground most days, arriving anywhere between 8-8.30am to begin work. Much of his time recently has been spent focused on the new stadium development. Levy rises early, responding to text and WhatsApp messages long before he leaves the family home in Totteridge, north London, for the journey to the training centre. It is there, at their magnificent new hub on the outskirts of Enfield, that Levy spent the day setting up deals by telephone and email last Monday. He appointed Franco Baldini as technical director in 2013, partly to detach himself from the frenzied atmosphere at the club on deadline day. Two years on, he cannot resist. ‘Daniel never raises his voice or shouts, even when transfers or deals are at their most delicate stage,’ revealed the club’s former director of football Damien Comolli. ‘That is why he always wins, because others lose their temper or start shouting. He is a calculated guy and he is prepared to wait and wait. ‘Most people get nervous or anxious, but he enjoys the challenge. He is an excellent negotiator.’ When Robbie Keane went on loan to West Ham in January 2011, an argument over removal cost amounting to £5,000 nearly scuppered the deal. Levy squeezes the pips on everything. Damien Comolli (right) praised Levy for his composure when negotiating transfer deals for Spurs . He spends hours in his vault on the first floor during the transfer window, pacing up and down a spartanly furnished office hypothesising over potential transfers on a notepad on his desk. Last Monday, when Levy swept into Tottenham’s training centre, he was ready for business. Deals were there to be done. Delle Alli, who has earned comparisons to Frank Lampard in the scouting reports filed for the club’s new head of recruitment Paul Mitchell, was already on his way for a medical. By then his football-mad son Josh, who works in the City for an investment bank, was asking people he has come across in the game whether Alli was good for the money. The day was starting to take shape. West Ham and West Brom had both made enquiries for midfielder Etienne Capoue. Roma wanted to get something going for central defender Vlad Chiriches. Tottenham signed 18-year-old Dele Alli on transfer deadline day before loaning him back to MK Dons . West Ham and West Brom had both asked about the availability of midfielder Etienne Capoue (left) Central defender Vlad Chiriches (left) had also caught the interest of Italian club Roma in Serie A . The pace picked up again when that nuisance Emmanuel Adebayor cropped up again in conversation. There was an air of anticipation because Levy somehow had to convince the £100,000-a-week forward to swap a Capital One Cup final against Chelsea on March 1 for a relegation battle with QPR. Rangers were desperate, calling up and offering to pay £75,000 towards Adebayor’s salary for the rest of the season. Predictably he didn’t fancy it. Later that afternoon, around 3pm, Adebayor’s agent Darren Dein, the son of former Arsenal vice-chairman David, believed he had devised a plan to suit all parties. West Ham would take him. It is at this moment, against the advice of practically everybody involved in the decision-making process at White Hart Lane, Levy refused to cede any ground. In the past, during negotiations to move to the Olympic Park for a year or to tenant Upton Park during the rebuilding of a new super-stadium at White Hart Lane, Brady felt he attempted to push her around. Anyone who has ever come across West Ham’s chief executive will tell you that Brady is a formidable lady. She can look after herself. When Levy negotiated with Real Madrid for the Gareth Bale deal, Tottenham got a record transfer fee . Bale (left) eventually signed for Real Madrid from Tottenham for a transfer fee of £86million . West Ham were offering to pay 50 per cent of Adebayor’s wages, £50,000-a-week, but Levy was well within his rights to point out the offer on the table from QPR. West Ham needed to up the ante. With the clock ticking on deadline day, Levy also made it clear that he did not want to sell to a perceived rival for fourth place in the Barclays Premier League, or to leave his squad weaker than when the window closed. Others felt differently, concerned that Adebayor’s dreadful attitude would affect the team’s rhythm in the run up to the Capital One Cup final at Wembley. Levy re-iterated that he calls the shots. His behaviour, along with his bargaining position, infuriated West Ham and it prompted some stinging criticism from Gold via social media when the window closed at 11pm. There are no winners here. There have been times when Levy has used reverse psychology, working a situation to his advantage to get the best possible deal for Tottenham. In the summer of 2013, Real Madrid offered £55m up front for Bale. Levy told Tottenham’s board that he would not sell the forward, but Bale’s heart was already set on a move to the Bernabeu. What followed was unusual for Levy, but he played the role of the junior partner in negotiations with Real’s president Florentino Perez in spectacular fashion. Levy played him like a fiddle, deferring to Perez when he agreed to fly out to Madrid on a private jet on two separate occasions to negotiate the terms over Bale’s transfer from Spurs. Levy wants to see more homegrown players such as Harry Kane (centre) play in the Tottenham first team . When he emerged from dinner on the second occasion, Perez had agreed to pay a world record fee of £86m to sign Bale from White Hart Lane. The dispute between the two clubs over the precise figures is because the transfer fee will be substanially less if Real can pay quicker than the five-year schedule agreed by Levy and Perez. Occasionally Levy’s staff see a softer side and they were surprised when he agreed to take the ice-bucket challenge after he was nominated by Andre Villas-Boas last year. Levy responded by nominating Perez, citing the departures of Luka Modric and Bale to Real Madrid over the past few years as the reasons behind his decision. He can be generous too and he once delivered a Porsche 911 Carrera 2 (but not a 4S, which is more expensive) to Martin Jol’s home as a gesture of goodwill when Spurs were performing well under their Dutch coach. Mostly, though, he is working on the serious business of making Spurs competitive and he has an almost pathological desire to reassert themselves in the top four. With the rapid progress of Harry Kane and Ryan Mason, he wants John McDermott, academy manager and head of coaching, to bring more young players into the first team. Levy has also been delighted to see Ryan Mason (centre) make his way into the Tottenham senior squad . The decision to sign Alli from MK Dons is another sign that Tottenham are once again investing in raw talent. In a few months time the transfer window will be on his radar and he can start to prepare for a serious turnover of playing staff before next season. As ever, Levy will walk away with the feeling that he has the upper hand.","Daniel Levy incensed West Ham with his deadline day negotiating methods .

"Daniel Sturridge was 23 years old when the proverbial penny dropped and, in turn, balls started landing in the back of the net. It took a big-money transfer to new surroundings to trigger his devastating improvement. Similarly, Danny Welbeck is 23 years old and has just completed a £16million move from Manchester United to Arsenal. On Monday night he scored both goals for England in a 2-0 victory in Switzerland. VIDEO Scroll down to watch England players stepped up - Hodgson . Easy does it: Danny Welbeck netted both goals in England's 2-0 win over Switzerland . Neat finish: Welbeck flourished playing through the middle rather than on the wing . Mobbed: Welbeck is congratulated by team-mates after scoring his second goal of the night for England . Sometimes footballers need a change, something different to think about, a new environment to spark an upturn in fortune. It worked for Sturridge, now 25. He has 36 goals from 52 outings since swapping Chelsea for Liverpool. So is Welbeck ready to enjoy a goals glut of his own in North London? His CV, of course, would suggest not; 37 from 178 during the course of his club career equates to one every five games or so. Team player: Welbeck often sacrificed himself for the good of the team at Manchester United . Club class: Welbeck completed his move from United to Arsenal on transfer deadline day . But goalscorers need to be treated as such, deployed in a central domain with chances carved for their benefit. Welbeck, at Old Trafford, spent more time on the wing than he did in the penalty box, something which irked the player himself. Ironically, it was an injury to Sturridge which presented him with his chance in Basle. He responded with a brace, the first poached from six yards and the second a cool finish from 12.

Career changing move: Sturridge benefited from his move from Chelsea (left) to Liverpool (right) At Arsenal he will be used as a centre forward. Chances will be fashioned. Welbeck will have no excuse. This weekend the Gunners face Manchester City, what better setting for the new boy to prove his worth? For ultimately all strikers are judged on the goals they return. Forget Welbeck the team player, the player who sacrificed himself manning a flank for United. It is time for Welbeck to demonstrate a selfish streak, to make himself a certain starter for club and country. Just the beginning: Welbeck can use his move to Arsenal to kick on and flourish for club and country . His progress will be monitored with trepidation from the North West. For Welbeck was one of their own, an academy graduate whose potential will now be realised at a top-flight rival. Manchester City – the club who nurtured Sturridge - know the feeling. Don’t forget that Welbeck is still only 23. His double on Monday took his Three Lions tally to 10. At the same age, Gary Lineker had one cap and no goals. Sturridge, similarly, has only flourished in the past 18 months. For Welbeck, Arsenal and England, then, this is only the beginning.

"Its been described as everything from terrifying to terrifc - and, with an estimated 68 million daily customers over 35,000 stores across the world, chances are you're going to meet 'Happy' eventually. For the singing, dancing, talking (and teethy) red box is McDonald's official new ambassador, even if the initial reaction has been anything but, well, happy. The slightly-menacing if very-simple mascot - an animated Happy Meal box with Gumby-like arms, a massive mouth and huge teeth - was introduced to America via Twitter on Monday as part of the chain's continual healthy image-based overhaul. But the reception was hardly as warm as the fast food giant was expecting. Scroll down for video . Happy mascot: McDonald's introduced its new ambassador to America on Monday, designed to encourage kids to eat healthier. The reaction was small, not super-sized . Entertainment site The A.V. Club called it 'an effective deterrent to both appetite and sleep'. According to Bloomberg, other reactions included 'THAT! Is scary', 'Epic fail' and 'This makes me crave Burger King'. 'So creepy,' added another user, Onika Abbott. 'Nightmare food,' offered another, John Estey. But the mega-restaurant's primary market for 'Happy' - as is a lot of the time with McDonald's - is children. Happy was designed as an attempt to encourage to kids to think about food in a more healthy fashion, coinciding with the release of a new 50-calorie serving of yoghurt and . applie slices that can, on request, be served with a Happy Meal . instead of fries. Small bottles of milk are also now available to replace soft drink. 'At . McDonald's, we're always looking to bring fun and happiness to . families,' said Julie Wenger, senior director of U.S. marketing, . McDonald's. The . animated box also seems to have built for the meme and GIF age, with . news clips and online campaigns spruiking specials and messages easily . spread throughout social media. Back in the day: The promotion of fast food has completely transformed over the last three decades. This ad, from 1984, featured then-mascot Hamburglar, stealing and eating as many cheeseburgers as possible . Image overhaul: To show they were doing their part to help fight America's obesitiy epidemic, McDonald's started including apple slices and a smaller portion of french fries in its Happy Meals in 2012. Now, from July 4, parents can opt to replace the fries with a serving of yoghurt . Compared to past mascots like Hamburglar, Grimace and Ronald McDonald himself, it is a minimalistic, almost clinical approach. There is no back story or costume, just a box with a message. McDonald's are said to have road-tested Happy in France in 2009 before unleashing him in the USA, which is not only the restaurant's home but its biggest market. The little guy has also appeared in Australia and New Zealand. Old school: Up until recently, the McDonald's stable of mascots featured Hamburglar, Ronald and Grimmace. Ronald underwent a makeover and now wears a sports jersey to appear more active . McDonald's Corp. aren't the other ones having an overhaul. Burger King Worldwide Inc. said yesterday they have dropped their 'Have It Your Way' slogan after 40 years and replaced it with 'Be Your Way'. The move is meant to better connect with consumers worldwide and highlight the chain's customizable sandwiches.

"Juan Cuadrado, Aaron Lennon and Darren Fletcher are among the players who are in contention to make their debuts since completing January moves. The aforementioned trio stole the headlines by joining Chelsea, Everton and West Brom respectively in what proved to be a relatively quiet transfer window. Lennon's move to Goodison Park has been in the spotlight as the winger looked extremely grumpy after sealing a move to Everton. However will the Toffees new boy be smiling at the final whistle on Saturday evening after his new side have taken on rivals Liverpool? Here, Sportsmail focuses on the players who could make their debut this weekend. Juan Cuadrado - Aston Villa vs CHELSEA . Colombia international Juan Cuadrado completed a £26.8miillion move to Chelsea during the final day of the winter transfer window despite the deal being in the pipeline since the start of January. Cuadrado will be hoping to make his Premier League bow this weekend against Premier League strugglers Aston Villa. The 26-year-old is expected to compete with the likes of Willian, Oscar and Eden Hazard for a first team spot at Stamford Bridge. Juan Cuadrado joined Chelsea from Fiorentina in a £26.8million deal on transfer deadline day . Aaron Lennon - EVERTON vs Liverpool . There is no better way of making yourself an instant hero at your new side than scoring a winner against your arch-rivals. Lennon could be handed the chance to do just that if he makes it on to the Goodison Park turf against Brendan Rodgers' side. The 27-year-old will be hoping to make an immediate impression at his new side after struggling to impress Tottenham boss Pochettino. Aaron Lennon looks glum as he is presented as an Everton player after signing on loan from Tottenham . Darren Fletcher - Burnley vs WEST BROM . West Brom new boy Darren Fletcher is expected to make his first Premier League appearance since making a substitute appearance in Manchester United's 3-1 Boxing Day win against Newcastle. The former Manchester United midfielder was allowed to leave Old Trafford on a free transfer after failing to hold down a regular first team spot under Louis van Gaal. Baggies boss Tony Pulis, who is likely to throw Fletcher straight into his starting XI, made a move for the 31-year-old after the Scotland international's transfer to West Ham collapsed. West Brom confirmed the signing of Darren Fletcher from Manchester United on deadline day . Gabriel Paulista - Tottenham vs ARSENAL . Gabriel Paulista could get his first taste of the north London derby on Saturday if Arsene Wenger chooses to call on his services. The former Villarreal defender may have to bide his time at the Emirates Stadium as Per Mertesacker and Laurent Koscielny are established first-team stars. Paulista, who is likely to start on the subs' bench at White Hart Lane, is 'ready to start', according to Wenger. Gabriel Paulista poses with an Arsenal shirt as the club unveil their new centre back . Pape Souare - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE . Crystal Palace have been crying out for a new left back since the start of the season as both Joel Ward and Martin Kelly have been forced into playing out of position. Pape Soare is in line to make his Crystal Palace debut at Leicester following his transfer from Lille. The 24-year-old, who signed a three-and-a-half-year deal at Selhurst Park, could replace Kelly on the left side of Palace's defence. New Eagles left back Pape Souare (left) with Crystal Palace co-chairman Steve Parish (right) Shola Ameobi - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE . Shola Ameobi was sent off in his final Premier League appearance for Newcastle back in May 2014. The 33-year-old will have to beat off competition from Yaya Sanogo, Dwight Gayle and Glenn Murray if he is going to make his Palace debut this weekend. Alan Pardew knows all about Ameobi having worked with the the striker at St James' Park. Shola Ameobi sealed a reunion with former Newcastle boss Alan Pardew by joining Crystal Palace . Keshi Anderson - Leicester vs CRYSTAL PALACE . Pardew has said Keshi Anderson will be included in Crystal Palace's squad to face the Foxes. Former non-league striker Anderson made a shock deadline day move to SE25 from Barton Rovers. Anderson has made an instant impact at the south London outfit by scoring for Palace's development side against rivals Millwall. Keshi Anderson signed for Crystal Palace on deadline day from non-league side Barton Rovers . Jack Cork - SWANSEA vs Sunderland . Swansea boss Garry Monk used a small chunk of the money received from the sale of Wilfried Bony to sign Jack Cork from Southampton. Cork spent much of his time on the subs' bench at St Mary's due to the fine form of fellow central midfielders Morgan Schneiderlin and Victor Wanyama. The 25-year-old, who started his career at Chelsea, will be desperate to start against Sunderland on Saturday. Former Chelsea midfielder Jack Cork completed his £3million move to Swansea from Southampton .

"If we believe in redemption, Ched Evans MUST be allowed to play football again . Beware the fury of the mob! It will only turn Ched Evans into the victim . Jim McMahon, leader of Oldham Council, sounded genuinely shocked. ‘In recent days we’ve seen a horrendous “trial by social media” with intimidation, abuse and harassment on a scale that has cast a terrible shadow,’ he said. ‘I am urging people on all sides of this debate to please now take stock, show some restraint and calm.’ Too late. The time to take stock was several days ago, when folk like McMahon were too busy adding their own amendments to the criminal justice system to consider much of anything. Leader of Oldham Council Jim McMahon (right) has been shocked by the 'trial by social media' around Ched Evans' proposed move to the Boundary Park-based club . Evans was linked with old club Sheffield United and Hartlepool United, and won't be moving to Oldham Athletic . Oldham chief executive Neil Joy reads out an official club statement outside Boundary Park on Thursday . Evans, pictured with his girlfriend Natasha Massey, issued a series of statements on Thursday . I am grateful for the support of the PFA in helping me try to return to football and continue my career. Upon legal advice, I was told not to discuss the events in question. This silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth. I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so. That the fury around the return of Ched Evans has now mutated to such an extent that it is suggested the daughter of an Oldham Athletic director was threatened with rape if Evans was employed, shows the inherent danger when leaders become followers. McMahon, and his fellow politicians, had the opportunity to stand foursquare behind the tenets of crime, punishment and rehabilitation, but chose easy populism instead. So now here we are. Ched Evans will not join Oldham after all, so the battle is won; but at what cost? Who will be thrown to the mob next, whose sentence will be morally adjusted on release, to satisfy the public whim? At a time when McMahon could have taken stock, he instead sniffed the air and told the world: ‘I don’t believe Mr Evans would be a suitable role model and ambassador for the town, or for the long-term reputation of the club.’ He does, however, believe in rehabilitation. He must, because he said so in the second paragraph of Thursday’s statement, and it is not as if a principle like that would just be tossed in, another empty slogan to appease the masses. QPR manager Harry Redknapp says convicts deserve a second chance once they have served their time . It has been widely reported that Oldham Athletic will not be signing Ched Evans, which we can now confirm. The whole issue has divided opinion and the club has been put under unbearable pressure as a result. Proceeding could have placed significant financial pressure on the club and continued to be a divisive influence. As a consequence the deal could not go ahead. As a club we condemn all crime including rape and irrespective of any appeal procedure it was always the case that we were prepared to withstand the barrage of abuse that is evident within the country and on social media. We deplore and condemn the vile and abusive threats, some including death threats, which have been made to our fans, sponsors and staff whilst this process has been in the public domain. Finally, we would like to place our gratitude to all who have supported the club during this difficult period, including the club staff, who have acted with professionalism at all times. We understand Ched has released his own statement on his website. The club will not be making any further statement on this matter. It says something for Britain’s political class when one of the more-rounded evaluations came from Harry Redknapp, manager of Queens Park Rangers. 'I think it’s about getting a second chance,’ Redknapp said on Thursday. ‘People go to prison, unfortunately a lot of them come out and somewhere along the line you’ve got to make a go of your life. What does he do? 'If he goes and works in a supermarket people are going to say “we’ve got a rapist working in the supermarket”. ‘Somewhere he’s got to work, whether that’s in football or elsewhere. He can’t just not be allowed to carry on with his life.’ That ‘unfortunately’ would suggest Redknapp is not a natural bleeding-heart liberal. Even he can see that society risks painting itself into a corner over Evans, though. Still, McMahon’s initial stance no doubt got him applause in all the right places, as did the statements by David Cameron, Ed Miliband and Shadow Minister for Sport Clive Efford. Cameron was still pontificating on Evans on Thursday in stark contrast to his views on Prince Andrew and allegations of underage sex slaves. Asked for his reaction to that story, the Prime Minister refused to comment. Why should he? It isn’t as if the fifth in line to the throne is a role model. It’s not as if he’s something very important, like Oldham Athletic’s No 9. Evans was released from prison in October, with his potential return to football sparking widespread debate . Oldham manager Lee Johnson will not be welcoming Evans into his squad after the Latics pulled the plug . It is with great sadness that today I have withdrawn from talks with Oldham Athletic. I would like to thank the Club, and those who have supported me in my lawful quest to find work. I apologise to the clubs supporters, sponsors and all those effected by the last 72 hours. Sadly the ‘mob rule’ tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them. The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldhams new stand it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair. Upon legal advice, I chose not to discuss the events in question. My silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth. I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effect that that night in Rhyl has had on many people, especially the woman concerned. Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.

"'I really am the pope': Pope Francis had to convince a suspicious receptionist that he was the real deal . Pope Francis's informal style came down to earth when he phoned a Vatican receptionist directly and was told: ‘And I'm Napoleon.’ The new pope had announced himself when he called a Jesuit residence in Rome on Friday and got through to the switchboard, according to Bitno.net. He had been trying to contact Adolfo Nicolas, the superior general of the Pope's old Jesuit order. But the baffled receptionist - identified only as Andreas - thought he was being pranked and snapped back: ‘Oh yes? And I'm Napoleon.’ The receptionist then tried to get a genuine response from the caller he believed to be a hoaxer, asking: 'Who is it?' His holiness showed great patience dealing with the suspicious assistant and eventually managed to convince him that the call was genuine . He responded: ‘I really am Pope Francis. 'Do not worry, Andreas, just connect me with Father General, I would like to thank him for the charming letter.' Andreas apologised when he realised what he had done. One Vatican expert explained: ‘You can't really blame the poor man. No other pope would have picked up a telephone to make their own calls. An official usually calls a secretary who places the call.’ ‘The receptionist is extremely distraught but I think the new pope has a good sense of humour and will laugh it off,’ they added. Pope Francis spoke to the crowd in St. Peter's Square before saying the Angelus prayer at the Vatican . Pope Francis was greeted much more warmly by the 150,000 people who gathered in St Peter's Square .

"Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony is facing an FA investigation over his incredible Twitter rant at the club’s players, fans and referee Jeremy Simpson. The millionaire owner of the League One club lost his temper after Posh’s fourth defeat in five League games at home, this time 2-0 by struggling Colchester. MacAnthony took to social media with a 14-point blast at the team, stay-away supporters and the official, who booked eight and dismissed manager Darren Ferguson. Simpson and Peterborough have history — two players were sent off this season against Crewe. Peterbrough chairman Darragh MacAnthony launched a scathing Twitter attack on players and fans . Having accused the players of ‘folding like a stack of cards’ he then laid into the referee, saying: ‘P..d off we had a ref who cost us Crewe game cause of incorrect decision was given us again, then sent manager off & many yellows today!’ Those comments will not go down well at the FA, who monitor Twitter. Likewise, the PFA could lodge a complaint with the club for the way MacAnthony chose to pinpoint players. The only person to escape criticism was boss Ferguson, who was sent to the stand for querying decisions. MacAnthony, who started every tweet with ‘p***** off’, singled out midfielder Joe Newell for missing a sitter and had a pop at fans who have deserted the club. He then pledged to carry on paying the bills at London Road and finished: ‘Oh & finally; if any of my plyrs are bit too sensitive to whats been said,feel free to let me know anytime.Or Alternatively just do your job!’ Here is the list of the 14 tweets from disgruntled Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony on Saturday . Peterborough United's Erhun Oztumer is dispossessed by Colchester United's George Moncur . Some fans supported his comments while others complained he had overstepped the mark but MacAnthony was unrepentant. He posted: ‘As for people saying you shouldn’t tweet etc as its not becoming of a chairman; I live in the 21st Century, maybe others should do the same!’ MacAnthony boarded a jet back to his home in the United States on Sunday night, declining to say any more. Dublin-born MacAnthony, a millionaire property entrepeneur, took over as Peterborough chairman in September 2006 following the departure of Barry Fry and became club's owner the following summer. Peterborough won promotion from League Two to the Championship in successive seasons in 2009 and won promotion back to the second tier after relegation in 2010, only to drop back down to League One again in 2013.

"In a wide-ranging economic stump speech Wednesday, President Obama focused laser-like on the growing gap between America's rich and poor, despite polling that shows hardly anyone believes it's the most pressing issue facing the U.S. The issue-pivot was an effort to help him move away from the drumbeat of criticism of his policies on health insurance reform and Iran's nuclear program, one White House insider said on background. 'Rising inequality and declining mobility is bad for our democracy,' he said during an event hosted by the far-left Center for American Progress. 'People get the bad taste that the system is rigged.' 'I believe this is the defining challenge of our time,' Obama said of income inequality. 'It drives everything I do in this office.' But according to Gallup polling from November 7-10, the most recent numbers available, only 1 per cent of Americans believe the 'gap between rich and poor' is the 'most pressing issue' facing the country. Yet Obama promised on Wednesday that 'for the rest of my presidency, that is where you should expect my administration to focus all of our efforts.' Scroll down for video . President Obama risks being considered tone-deaf and distant in his lame-duck period, focusing on an issue that few Americans care deeply about . Obama didn’t offer new policy prescriptions, but railed against businesses for opposing a minimum-wage hike and for embracing the outsourcing of jobs. 'Wage issues,' Gallup reports, also rate just 1-percent support when Americans are asked to identify their most pressing concern. The GOP was quick to pounce. A spokesman for Sen. Jeff Sessions, the Senate Budget Committee's ranking Republican, complained that Obama's focus on increasing immigration rates has been 'a major factor in the decline of workers’ wages.' 'This trend would be accelerated dramatically and painfully by the president’s proposal to double the number of guest workers – including h1b workers who will compete directly with struggling college students – while tripling the number of people granted permanent residency.' Obama's speech was hosted by the liberal Center for American Progress, a group founded and run by Bill Clinton White House Chief of Staff John Podesta . But few Americans, just 2 per cent, are most concerned about immigration. In the fifth year of Obama's presidency, 'dissatisfaction with government' is the single highest-rated American worry, with 26 per cent saying it makes them more uneasy than any other issue. And amid Obamacare's disappointing rollout and early implementation failures, 19 per cent of Americans believe healthcare is America's most important problem. Wednesday's speech was a decidedly conscious attempt to pivot away from the singular focus on defending Obamacare that has engulfed the White House for two months. The president claimed on Wednesday that before his Affordable Care Act became law, 14,000 Americans 'lost their health insurance every single day,' but didn't mention that at least 5 million have lost their medical insurance this fall. Another 80 million or more are expected to lose their small group insurance coverage, according to 2010 regulatory projections from inside the Obama administration. Unemployment is the most important issue among 13 per cent of Americans, according to Gallup, and the U.S. budget deficit is feared most by 12 per cent. Both issues are persistent thorns among Obama defenders. Physician, heal thyself? Twenty-six per cent of Americans are more worried about their dysfunctional government than anything else, a number that beats every other specific issue . Elephant in the room? Republicans warn that loosening immigration policy has already driven wages down, and opening the floodgates will make things worse . In January 2009, Obama's transition team projected that a broad stimulus spending approach would drive America's unemployment rate down to 5 per cent by July 2013. But even with modest declines, Friday's jobs report is expected to show a 7.2 per cent unemployment rate. The so-called 'U-6' unemployment rate, a more realistic measure which also includes Americans who have given up searching for work, hit 13.8 per cent in November. The federal deficit, while shrinking year-on-year from an all-time high in 2009, is projected to explode again after 2016 because of the growth of health care, Social Security, and Medicaid spending. The years of President Obama's presidency have seen more added to the national debt than in all the other presidential administrations combined. Dwarfing the class-warfare fight: For every American who ranks income inequality as the most pressing U.S. issue, 19 put healthcare at the top of their lists . Obama pivoted away from Iran and his health insurance overhaul law, pointing to an economic agenda that he hopes captures Americans' imagination -- and distracts them from his administration's missteps . The White House told reporters that 400 people attended the president's speech, which was hosted by the Center for American Progress, a far-left think tank founded by former Clinton White House Chief of Staff John Podesta. It has drawn the ire of progressive purists for accepting funding from giant corporations including Comcast, Wal-Mart, General Motors, Pacific Gas and Electric, General Electric, Boeing and Lockheed Martin. By the 15-minute mark of Obama's 50-minute, 6,575-word address, only one of the three major U.S. cable news networks – the liberal-leaning MSNBC – was still broadcasting it live. Both CNN and the Fox News Channel switched to other programming.","Gallup polls show income inequality hardly registers on Americans' worry-meter .
The top concerns of Americans – dissatisfaction with government, the national deficit, unemployment and healthcare – are Obama's weak spots .
Obama's speech Wednesday ran so long that two out of the three major U.S. cable news channels stopped covering it mid-way through ."
"Peterborough chairman Darragh MacAnthony has launched a scathing attack on the club's players and fans after another home defeat saw them fall further behind the top six in Sky Bet League One. Posh's 2-0 defeat to Colchester was their fourth loss in their last five league games at London Road and a sequence of one win in their last six matches has left them five points adrift of the play-off places, heaping more pressure on manager Darren Ferguson.

"There was a time when youngsters would be dressed in their Sunday best for a trip to the high street photographer to capture timeless images as they developed from angelic babies to spotty teens. However, new 3D printing technology means it is now possible to create 'mini-me' models – or shelfies - that can be placed on the mantelpiece or sent to granny. Scanning booths are being opened in Asda stores that can capture a 3D image of a person in just 12 seconds as the template to create an 8in model made from layers of ceramic powder. Scroll down for video . Asda is opening scanning booths that can capture a 3D image of a person in just 12 seconds as the template to create an eight inch model made from layers of ceramic powder . The scanners are so sophisticated that they can capture every detail, down to the hair colour, clothes and even a watch or ring. Asda believes the new technology could see the advent of a new craze for what it calls a 'shelfie' a miniature model to replace the 'selfie' that people take with their smartphones. During an initial trial it found customers would be keen to use the system to create 3D models of brides and grooms in their wedding outfits, children in their sports kits with medals, forces personnel going on tour and loved ones spending time apart. Asda found some liked the idea of capturing them wearing fancy dress, while others wanted a permanent record of them before and after a drastic slimming regime. The supermarket unveiled the first automatic scanning booth in its store in Trafford, Manchester, yesterday and has plans to introduce them into ten more, assuming customers like the idea. In fact, it would be possible to create an entire family set of ceramic figures as a permanent record to either sit on a shelf or send to loved ones. The advent of 3D printing promises to revolutionise lives in the same way as the home computer and internet. 3D printers have already been created for domestic use and are becoming increasingly sophisticated, allowing people to print products they need for the home, ranging from ornaments to doorknobs and even sports shoes. While the technology is also now being used in medicine to help in facial reconstruction or to build prosthetics to replace limbs, while parts are being modelled for the aircraft and motor industry. Asda first trialled the creation of 3D models of customers at a store in York, however this involved a wait of around five minutes as a member of staff effectively surveyed their body using a handheld scanned. The new booths can do the job automatically in just 12 seconds. The scanner takes thousands of pictures of the customer, mapping every contour and picking up the colours of the skin and clothing. Computer software then builds up a 3D image, like jigsaw, of the individual on a screen. The resulting computer file is sent via the web to an Asda facility in Sheffield where a 3D printer, which measures about 6ft by 3ft and costs around £40,000, builds the model. Conventional 3D printers work by building up a figure in plastic, layer by layer, through a nozzle that can only produce models in one colour. This new system creates a model from a box which is filled with a white powdered ceramic. A series of jets fire water or colours at the ceramic which solidifies. It is a similar reaction to putting a blob of water on talcum powder. When finished an airbrush is used to remove the fine white powder to reveal the model, which is created in all the colours captured during the original scan. The system has six million colours. Asda's chief merchandising officer, Andrew Moore, said: 'The possibilities with 3D printing are endless and I'm pleased that we're ahead of the game in making this truly transformational technology an everyday reality for our customers. 'We are committed to making the newest and most exciting technology available to our customers. 'We were the first to bring affordable 3D printing to the market and customers were queuing round the block to try it out. Following an overwhelming positive initial reaction from shoppers, the obvious next step was to provide improved innovation that we hope will become a permanent fixture in our stores.'","Technology means it is now possible to create 'mini-me' models .

"Nicolas Anelka's return to football after a ban for his 'quenelle' gesture ended in a 5-1 defeat in the Indian Super League. The 35-year-old was banned for five-games by the FA after he performed the anti-semitic gesture having scored for West Brom against West Ham earlier this year. Anelka signed for Mumbai City FC in September but missed the first three games of the season to complete his ban.

Anelka (fourth right) lines up with his Mumbai team-mates ahead of the match against Chennaiyin FC . His return to action, however, proved forgettable as Mumbai lost 5-1 to Chennaiyin FC - their third defeat in four matches. Anelka played the entire match but failed to shine, as former Manchester City midfielder Elano and Colombian striker Stiven Mendoza scored twice and Jeje Lalpekhlua netted once for Chennaiyin. Syed Rahim Nabi scored a consolation goal for Peter Reid's Mumbai, who are now sixth in the eight team league. Anelka has been without a club since he was sacked by West Brom for gross misconduct in March. Anelka (centre) makes a gesture after scoring for West Brom against West Ham in December last year . The former Arsenal and Real Madrid striker denied his use of the 'quenelle' gesture was anti-Semitic and that he made the gesture in support of his friend Dieudonne M'bala M'bala, a controversial French comedian. Anelka was banned for five matches, fined £80,000 and ordered to complete an educational course. The report also stated: 'We did not find that Nicolas Anelka is an anti-Semite or that he intended to express or promote anti-Semitism by his use of the quenelle' The FA had initially wanted a tougher punishment but did not appeal the sentence. Anelka did not appeal either.","Nicolas Anelka made his debut for Mumbai City FC on Tuesday .

The Daily Telegraph reported she attended Supreme court on Monday to appeal the 2012 decision, saying the elderly billionaire had 'intentions to create legal relations' with her.

"Senior officials in the Bill Clinton White House got rid of intern Monica Lewinsky in 1996 as her affair with the president heated up, shuffling her off to the Pentagon in a move that ultimately backfired. By 1996 West Wing staffers had started to refer to Lewinsky as 'the stalker' since she was around the Oval Office more than any intern would normally be. Top administration officials were instructed to find her a federal government job outside the White House, according to a document made public Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library. Lewinsky would get her transfer, meeting civil servant Linda Tripp at the Defense Department and launching the friendship that would lead to recorded phone calls, leaks, and a presidential impeachment. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Monica Lewinsky has lived in London for much of the 17 years since she left the public eye (shown here in June 2014), but her infamous name has made employment and personal relationships elusive . In this April 1996 email, the Clinton White House's chief administrator told a deputy and the personnel office director that they were all to help Lewinsky find a government job outside the White House . It was Tripp's recordings of Lewinsky describing her sexual relationship with Clinton that put the then-president on the defensive after he famously claimed 'I did not have sexual relations with that woman.' Among documents released Friday by the Clinton Presidential Library is an email from Patsy Thomasson, then director of the White House Office of Administration, to two deputies, explaining that they were to help Lewinsky find a job in the Department of Defense. 'Our direction is to make sure she has a job in an Agency,' Thomasson wrote to White House management and administration director Jodie Torkelson, copying personnel director Bob Nash. 'We have not finalized the deal but are working toward that end.' 'We are working closely with DOD to make this happen for Monica,' she wrote, adding that she was acting on a request from an aide named Tim. 'Monica is coming in to see me today pursuant to Tim's request,' she wrote. The note also referred to a second person in need of a job change, Director of Congressional Correspondence Jocelyn Jolley. It was sent on April 9, 1996, at a time when Lewinsky was seen by West Wing insiders as a liability to Clinton. Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr would later present testimony to a grand jury from witnesses who said she spent a suspicious amount of time in or near the Oval Office in early 1996. The Lewinsky story, first uncovered and subsequently spiked by Newsweek, reached the public through a little-known website called The Drudge Report, which quickly became a go-to online page for news junkies. The Republican-led House of Representatives successfully impeached Clinton in December 1998 on charges of perjury and obstruction of justice. One for the history books: President Clinton (right) had an 'inappropriate relationship' with Lewinsky (left), when she was 22 and 23 . On the rocks: Clinton's marriage to future Secretary of State (and maybe presidential candidate) Hillary Rodham Clinton took a hit from what would be merely the most public in a series of political 'bimbo eruptions' A Senate trial, however, failed to convict him and remove him from office – an outcome that required a two-thirds supermajority of senators. Democrats declared victory the day the votes were counted, and Clinton served out the remainder of his second term in office. The Clinton Library released its seventh collection of papers from the 1993-2001 White House years on Friday, sending journalists into a frenzied read through thousands of pages of never-before-seen documents covering everything from the Whitewater scandal to the death of Vince Foster. Lewinsky has said publicly that she had trouble finding employment after she left the Pentagon in disgrace in 1997. She now writes blog essays for Vanity Fair . Tripp now lives in Middleburg, Virginia, where she runs a year-round Christmas shop with her husband.","1996 email shows White House Office of Administration director was told to find Lewinsky a job at the Pentagon .

"The man who dismembered and cooked up his transgender wife in a horrific murder-suicide was laid to rest in his hometown, with tracks from British super group Queen played at the funeral. Friends and family of Marcus Volke gathered at Doveton Park Funeral Centre in Ballarat, Victoria, at 2.30pm on Thursday to pay tribute to the 28-year-old. The iconic band's well-known hits such as 'Killer Queen', 'Another One Bites the Dust' and 'Don't Stop Me Now' were heard blaring from speakers as Volke was remembered as a 'gentle' young man with 'blue eyes', the Herald Sun reported. Scroll down for video . Marcus Volke was laid to rest on Thursday in his hometown of Ballarat at Doveton Park Funeral Centre . The 28-year-old was a male escort who worked under the name of Heath and advertised on online escorting sites . It is believed he killed his transgender wife Mayang Prasetyo whose remains were found strewn across the couple's new Teneriffe apartment on October 4 . It follows a candlelight vigil held for his Indonesian wife, Mayang Prasetyo, last week in New Farm Park - in Brisbane's inner-city - close to Teneriffe where her remains were found boiling in chemicals on the stove of the couple's apartment. The gruesome discovery was made by police on October 4 when neighbours in the newly constructed DoubleOne 3 apartment building. Instead of sending or bringing flowers to the service, Volke's family asked mourners to donate to mental health service beyondblue. The 28-year-old's uncle, Wolfgang Volke, told the 250 mourners gathered at the funeral home that his 'caring, loyal and gentle' nephew loved karate and was an avid reader of comic books when he was younger. These three pugs were taken from Mayang Prasetyo's apartment after she was brutally murdered . Other tracks heard at the funeral were Pink Floyd's 'Wish You Were Here' and Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters', which was played alongside a presentation of photos of Volke during the 45-minute service. Led Zeppelin's 'Stairway to Heaven' was played as his coffin - made of dark brown pine - was transferred to a hearse. The funeral service comes more than a week after Volke's father, Peter Volke, took to social media to thank people for their support. Messages of support and tributes for Volke's family flooded in after the senior Volke wrote: 'Thank you all for your kind support in this difficult time.' Friends of Peter Volke and his wife, Dorothy Volke, reached out to the couple via the post. 'We are thinking of you and sending all our love and support... R.I.P Marcus you will be missed xx,' one friend wrote. Another expressed their shock at the tragedy: 'I know this is a hard time for you and I hope my prayers help you guys. I am still in disbelief, Marcus will be missed so, so much. Love you guys.' Earlier this week, it emerged the RSPCA had been inundated with offers to adopt orphaned pugs thought to be left behind by Ms Prasetyo. The 27-year-old sex worker had started breeding dogs at the couple's upmarket apartment just a month before she was brutally killed at the hands of her husband. The couple met Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome while they were both working as escorts in 2009 . Volke worked at the Pleasure Dome as a male prostitute for about two and a half years before he and Ms Prasetyo both left to work privately in 2012 . Details of the couple's life have been slowly pieced together since the tragic murder-suicide. Since October 4, it has been revealed Volke and Ms Prasetyo met while they were both working at Melbourne brothel Pleasure Dome in 2009. It had initially been reported the couple met on a cruise while both were working as chefs. A friend, Alex Devantier, told Daily Mail Australia Volke had told his family and friends that story to cover up the truth. Volke's working name was Heath XL and described himself as a 'young sexy Australian boy, very friendly and easy going' in an online advertisement. 'I can be your companion for an hour or as long as u want, for a dinner, a hot session, holidays or more,' it said. Queensland Police removed a toxic-labelled container from the inner-city apartment, following the gruesome discovery . The grisly death is being treated as a murder-suicide after Volke fled the scene and was later found in an industrial bin with his throat cut . Police also revealed the distinctive stench of boiling human flesh is what led them to the grisly discovery on that Saturday night. Even a mix of chemicals could not disguise the smell. It was a vital part of the murder plot that  Volke failed to take into consideration, Brisbane Times reported. When police arrived at their home, Volke fled the scene and reportedly asked someone on the street if they had seen a man with a knife, in a bid to throw the police off track. He was later found with his throat slashed and a knife in an industrial bin nearby. Nearly a week after police attended the murder scene, mourners gathered to pay tribute to the victim of a horrific crime that shocked Australia and the world. Candles flickered while 150 people remembered a kind, generous and ambitious woman in New Farm Park in Brisbane, Queensland on Friday. The grim details surrounding her death, although well known by those who attended the vigil, were not uttered, instead she was remembered for the legacy she left behind. Volke's funeral service follows a candlelight vigil held at New Farm Park in Brisbane, Queensland on Friday . Friends shared tales of how generous she was and how she loved 'travelling, she loved good food, good fashion, music, friends . Ms Prasetyo was described as an avid traveller and loved 'good food, good fashion, music, friends' Ms Mayang's friend Brad Whitehouse shared tales of how generous she was and how she pledged to 'leave the game' once she had turned 30 and had enough money to provide a comfortable life for her family. 'She loved travelling, she loved good food, good fashion, music, friends - being in the hub of her network of friends,' Mr Whitehouse recalled. 'She brought people together.' While mourners were quick to note Ms Mayang was not defined by her race, gender identity or profession, her story became a rallying point for those who could relate to those aspects of her life.","Funeral service for Marcus Volke was held on Thursday in Ballarat .

"Angry: Brian May branded some neighbours 'selfish', and said they had 'declared war' on his family . Queen guitarist Brian May has accused his neighbours of turning upmarket Kensington into a 'hellhole' with their constant building works. The musician, 66, branded residents of the west London suburb 'selfish', and said they had 'declared war' on his family through constant construction work in his once 'nice quiet decent' neighbourhood. Writing on the 'Bri's Soapbox' section of his own website, May said he regularly lost sleep and could no longer enjoy sitting in his garden thanks to noise from the machines used by builders. May seemed particularly put-out by the presence in his neighborhood of piling rigs, which he described as 'an instrument of torture'. He said his life has been dominated by the 'infernal machines' over the last four months, leaving him unable to find anywhere in his home to escape the noise, despite some of the rooms being triple-glazed. 'Whom would a peaceful person like myself fantasise about making suffer? Well . that would be the people who have passed sentence on me without me . having committed a crime - the people who have declared war on me and my . family, to whom I had done no harm,' May wrote on his website about the noise. 'The builders, of course, are only doing . their job, and, though it would be nice if they acted in a considerate . manner, it's the owners of the property who are the ones who are really . guilty of this of this monstrous invasion of my life,' he added. 'These people decided that they'd . increase the value of their house by building a basement which is the . whole area of the garden, and two stories deep,' May went on to say. He was referring to the . common practice of building large basement conversions in properties in . the London borough of Kensington and Chelsea - a type of construction the local . council are under pressure from long-term residents to reduce. Powerless: The Queen guitarist said some of his neighbours have turned upmarket Kensington (pictured) into a 'hellhole' with their constant building works . 'Infernal machine': May seemed particularly put-out by the presence in his neighborhood of piling rigs (pictured) which he described as 'an instrument of torture' Some of these structures are so big that they are known as 'megabasements', with several floors extending beneath both the existing property and the garden. This often leaves the homes with even more floorspace below ground than above. May described local building rules 'nonsensical' and called for a complete reform of the planning permission system. 'Kensington used to be a nice quiet decent place to live... now it's becoming a hellhole,' he said. May also warned that the relentless noise could have a serious affect on his family's physical well-being. Famous friends: Earlier this week Brian May (right) was joined by Roger Daltrey (left) and Bill Wyman (second from right) at the unveiling of new mural by Sgt Pepper LP sleeve artist Sir Peter Blake (second from left) 'We are stressed, angry, constantly . irritated, and wracked by feelings of powerlessness - this is exactly . the kind of long-term stress that causes damage to health,' he said. May said he is concerned that he may have to leave Kensington if the noise continues and urged locals to rally together and launch a joint legal action against those building basement conversions. 'Perhaps if we all value our peace and . quiet at a million pounds, and we all sue the b******** at the same time... they might think twice about behaving like this again.' 'This is an appeal for help... time to take action,' he added.","Brian May, 66, said some of his neighbours had 'declared war' on his family .

"Jose Mourinho was in a cantankerous mood as he broke his self-imposed silence after avoiding media responsibilities for the last ten days. Mourinho was speaking publicly for the first time since being fined £25,000 by the Football Association for saying there was a ‘clear campaign’ by referees against Chelsea. He said he was only attending the press conference to preview his side’s match at Aston Villa tomorrow because he had to. ‘You know why I'm here, so you cannot expect that I'm super happy to be here,’ he said. Asked why he didn’t speak to the media before Chelsea’s 1-1 draw with title rivals Manchester City, Mourinho said: ‘Because, if you want, you can make a silence very noisy. Jose Mourinho spoke to press on Friday ahead of Chelsea's trip to Aston Villa . Chelsea manager Mourinho was in a cantankerous mood as he broke his self-imposed silence . Mourinho was speaking publicly for the first time since being fined £25,000 by the Football Association . Mourinho insisted that Juan Cuadrado (left) was not a panic buy, but a reaction to Andre Schurrle's exit . ‘If I was a journalist, from silence I could make lots of words.’ In a thinly veiled criticism of the Premier League and FA, Mourinho referenced his touchline spat with Arsene Wenger earlier this season. ‘The only surprise I had was not to be punished when I was pushed by another manager. Apart from that, I can expect everything.’ Asked if his new £27million signing Juan Cuadrado would make his debut against Villa, Mourinho jibed: ‘I think he can, unless the Premier League or FA say some rule stops him.’ Are you excited by Cuadrado? 'Normal.' Normal? 'Yeah. Normal.' What can he bring? 'I don't think it's the best thing for him that I speak about expectations. He needs his time, as everyone does. He will have his time. It's not a panic buy. It's a reaction to Schurrle, a departure that is not a panic buy because he's a player we've known for a long, long time. 'I've coached in his league for two seasons. We are happy with our business. Schurrle is a player we like very, very much but the business was very good. We are happy with it.' Any regret with Schurrle? 'No. No. We are happy with what he gave us. We are happy with the investment we did on him, one and a half years ago. We are happy with the profit we made in this transfer window. Hopefully we made him a better player. Hopefully he can have success in the future because we like him very much.' You never seem to win at Villa Park... why is this? 'Because the opponents score more goals than us, or sometimes the same number of goals.' They're the team with the least goals, you're the team with the most... hot favourites? 'I don't have to speak about Aston Villa.' What did you learn from that defeat last year? 'I learned nothing that I hadn't learned before that. There are matches that are impossible to win and you have to be smart enough to understand that. Afer so many years in football, there are matches that I clearly know it's impossible to win.' How many sides are there in the title race? 'That's not my problem. We are one side. It's up to the others to wonder whether they are title contenders or not. We consider we are, even if sometimes it's more difficult that it might be. But we consider ourselves contenders.' Team news? 'Filipe [Luis] is injured. The player [Diego Costa] is suspended.' Fabregas? 'I told you. Filipe is injured and the player who is suspended is suspended. Everybody (else) is fit.' Where will Cuadrado play in your team? 'Goalkeeper impossible because we don't need him there. Central defenders we don't need, and he's too small. After that he can play everywhere.' Is he ready now? 'I think he can, unless the Premier League or FA say some rule stops him.' Can Mohammed Salah come back? 'He's a Chelsea player who is on loan. He's our player. When we sell the players, they're not ours. But he is our player.' Are you proud of the business you've done in the last few windows? 'That's not my job at the club. You have to give credit to the people in the club who deal with numbers. They deserve credit for that.' Does that game at Villa Park still rankle with you? 'I don't speak about it. I don't have to speak about it.' Drogba or Remy tomorrow? 'Yes. One (of them).' Five points clear, Capital One Cup final, Champions League last 16, you should be enjoying it. You don't appear to be? Is that fair? 'I'm enjoying my work with my players. When I like my players, when I like my squad, I'm much more happy, more motivated to work, and this is the case.' It's just when you speak to us? 'Speak to you? You know why I'm here, so you cannot expect that I'm super happy to be here.' So you're here because you have to be here? 'Yes.' Could Cuadrado start? Or does he need a bit longer to settle down? 'I'm going to repeat the words I said three weeks ago, so many now people can understand. I said, he fits into the Fiorentina and Colombia's team. At this moment, he fits in Colombia and Chelsea teams.' Is he at the right physical level? 'He trained just two days. I cannot say much. The business situation almost to the last minute on Monday, he had to go to Paris for visas and the legal situation on the Tuesday. He only trained here a couple of days. I cannot say much.' Why didn't you speak to the media before City? 'Because, if you want, you can make a silence very noisy. It depends what you want to do. You could. You could. You could make noise with my silence, because you know the reason for my silence. It depends on you. If I was a journalist, from silence I could make lots of words.' All because of Costa's ban? 'Not just (that).' How do you reflect on that suspension? 'I don't reflect, because maybe I'll be punished if I reflect. Maybe they can read my reflection, and I don't want that.' Any word on Kurt Zouma's progression? 'Good. Very good.' Do you expect more from him still? 'A kid of 20, I expect always to improve.' Are you pleased with your position? 'I feel the distance could be much bigger. If I analysed – which I'm not going to do – the last five, six, seven matches, we could, we should have a bigger difference.' Why no new deal announced with Hazard? 'Why should it be officialised? Why? What's the problem? He has a contract with Chelsea for two or three more years. Are you worried? I'm not worried. I'm not worried.' Varane at 18, now Zouma at 20 with Chelsea... are you impressed by both players, the future of the French team? 'I think the French federation should write me a letter to thank me because I think they have now the two best young defenders in the world. Not the two 'best', because they are young. There are final products, mature players of 25, 28, 30 years of age. But as young defenders, can you imagine what Zouma and Varane could represent in a couple of years? Didier [Deschamps] should be very happy with that. For sure.' Do you expect to be fined by the Premier League for not attending the media conferences? 'You know, the only surprise I had in relation for that was not to be punished when I was pushed by another manager. Apart from that, I can expect everything.' Are you thinking about PSG? 'No. Three matches to play before that. I don't have time. I have to prepare Aston Villa, Everton and, after that, yes. After Everton I will prepare for PSG.' How did University affect your life? 'Every experience you have in life helps you to be what you are. University was five years of my life. For sure, it made a contribution to what I am. I cannot measure it. I can't say it's more important than being a manager's son, or more important than being an assistant to other managers.

"A daughter helped grant her dying mother's wish to renew her wedding vows before she passed away. Mother-of-three Dawn Wood, 48, battled cancer for years and after expressing her desire to have the opportunity to have a second wedding, daughter Chelsea took it upon herself to plan the event as a surprise gift for her parents. Dawn had first been diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006. The lump she’d found had originally been wrongly dismissed as benign and by the time it was diagnosed correctly the cancer had spread to her lymph nodes. Dawn Wood (lower right) surround by her family; husband Kevin (lower left) and children (top l-r) Chelsea, Liam and Lauren . Despite extensive surgery and chemotherapy she was diagnosed with lung cancer in 2011 and had two-thirds of her right lung removed. Her daughter Chelsea, a hairdresser, from Barnsley, South Yorks, says:  ‘Mum refused to feel sorry for herself, she wasn’t like that.  She was always thinking of everybody else and everyone loved her. ‘She was the life and soul, loved dancing and karaoke. ‘After her lung operation she and Dad took over the local pub and it wasn’t long before she was belting out Abba hits louder than anybody.’ But one evening in April last year Chelsea, 22, and her younger sister Lauren, 19, found Dawn collapsed on the bathroom floor. Says Chelsea: ‘Her mouth was clamped shut and her skin looked grey.  Dad rushed her to hospital and before long, she was awake telling us she was fine.’ Sisters Chelsea (left) and Lauren organised the whole event in secret for their mother . Despite surgery and chemotherapy Dawn's cancer continued to spread. Tragically she passed away just days after renewing her vows . However test results showed that the cancer had spread and she had eight brain tumours. Says Chelsea: ‘I asked her consultant if there was any hope but there wasn’t. They could only offer treatment to give her a bit longer. ‘I was fighting back tears, but Mum smiled and took my hand and said: ” Let’s enjoy the time I have left.’ Dawn continued to fight but soon she was spending most of her time in bed hooked up to an oxygen tank. Says Chelsea: ‘She was growing weaker and one evening I asked her if there was anything she’d like to do. 'Mum refused to feel sorry for herself, she wasn't like that,' says Chelsea (L-R: Chelsea, Dawn and Lauren) ‘She told me she wanted to renew her wedding vows with Dad for their 25th anniversary. ‘When I told Dad he pointed out it was three years away and we all knew she didn’t have that amount of time left. ‘My heart was breaking. But in my mind I began to form a plan.’ Keeping it a secret Chelsea rang the local social club and booked it for a few weeks ahead. She emailed family and friends and her and Lauren booked a vicar and the local chapel. Chelsea used her own savings to finance her scheme, but as word spread the local community began pitching in too, donating services and items for the event. Says Chelsea: ‘As a hairdresser I didn’t earn much but I began scrimping and saving for Mum’s big day. The emotional event saw Dawn and Kevin reaffirming their vows to each other and sharing a first dance again . ‘She kept asking me where all my money was going as each week I appeared flat broke. ‘And I was running out of cash, but my step-brother Liam, 26, chipped in what he could.’ The DJ offered to play for free and the buffet and cake cost them next to nothing while Dawn’s best friend Vikki bought the bridesmaid dresses and Chelsea’s boss and her mother provided the flowers and the car. Four weeks before the big day they handed Dawn and Kevin an envelope - an invitation to their own wedding. Dawn wore a full length satin gown with a panel of sparkling diamante for the big day, and even managed to walk down the aisle unaided . Chelsea recalls: ‘Mum was laughing and crying all at the same time she couldn’t believe it, she was thrilled, and so was Dad. ‘We took her out in her wheelchair to shop for her dress.  She chose a one-shouldered full length satin gown with a panel of sparkling diamante - she looked stunning.’ Despite being rushed to hospital a week before the ceremony Dawn convinced her doctors to discharge her the night before her big day, able to attend the service with her oxygen tank. ‘To everyone’s amazement Mum pushed herself up and out of her wheelchair and summoning up all her strength walked up the aisle to where Dad was waiting for her', says Chelsea. ‘They gazed into each other eyes and renewed their vows....in sickness and health...till death do us part. ‘As I looked around I noticed there wasn’t a dry eye in the church. ‘Afterwards at the reception Mum said she wanted to dance, so she did, in her wheelchair as she and dad kissed and hugged to the song: ‘I don’t want to close my eyes,’ by Aerosmith. ‘We’d invited around 250 people and as everyone kept coming up to her she smiled and dazzled throughout. ‘It was so emotional I couldn’t stop crying, but Mum was loving every minute.' Next day Dawn was rushed back to hospital. Tests showed she’d probably suffered a heart attack during the celebrations but had managed to keep it hidden from her family and friends. She passed away a few days later with Chelsea, Lauren, Liam, Kevin, and 16 close friends and family by her bedside. Chelsea says: ‘We miss Mum so much but we know she’s in a better place. ‘And I’m just so glad we were able to fulfill her last wish. In doing so she filled ours too, to make her happy.’","Dawn battled cancer for years before being told it was terminal .

"Prince Harry was joined at the Invictus Games by America's second lady Jill Biden as the wounded warriors pushed their bodies to the limit at the sporting spectacle. Harry welcomed Mrs Biden to the competition for injured servicemen and women and the pair watched a wheelchair basketball match at the Copper Box arena. The prince and second lady both have a common interest in supporting their Armed Forces. Scroll down for video . Prince Harry (left) cheered on brave servicemen as he settled in for the day's action at the Invictus Games - alongside the U.S. vice-president's wife Jill Biden (right) The pair shook hands with basketball players from New Zealand and America and mingled with competitors as they soaked up the atmosphere court-side. Prince Harry and Dr Biden (pictured watching the action) have met in the past when the Royal travelled to Washington DC in 2012 to accept a humanitarian award for his efforts supporting injured members of the Armed Forces . Roared on: Road cyclists John-James Chalmers, Paul Vice and Robert Cromley-Hawke finished in unison . Cause: Prince Harry vowed to bring the event to Britain after being inspired by the US Warrior Games . Harry is a serving Army officer who was the driving force behind the Invictus Games, while the Mrs Biden is a keen supporter of forces families in the US and is involved in a number of initiatives. One of highlights of the day was the rowing events where the servicemen and women, many with missing limbs, battled each other and the clock as they competed over a number of distances. Former Royal Engineer Captain, Nick Beighton - who lost both legs in 2009 after stepping on an improvised explosive device while in Afghanistan, won gold as the British Armed Forces team claimed a clean sweep of medals in the one-minute rowing machine sprint event. He also claimed victories in a four-minute rowing race and in a team event. The two high profile spectators were all smiles as they enjoyed the action on the third day of the event, which sees wounded serving or veteran servicemen and women from across the globe. Impressed: Prince Harry and Jill Biden applaud brave servicemen battling it out on the basketball court . Prince Harry and Dr Biden were watching the basketball competition at the Copper Box arena in London . Preparations: The Prince was busy behind the scenes at the Olympic Park in Stratford, east London . Harry presented the medals to the British trio - Mr Beighton, silver medallist Scott Meehan and Cowan Botha who came third. The ex-officer, from Shrewsbury, who lost his legs during an explosion while on a foot patrol in Afghanistan in 2009, competed in the Paralympics but narrowly missed out on a bronze medal in the double sculls. He added: 'There was a real buzz out there everyone lifted their game but you try and tune it out a little but because you're trying to focus on what you're doing.' He added: 'It's given everyone the opportunity to compete not just the Paralympians among us but right down to the people who have recently been injured -it's great to have a focus to get out there and do something.' The Invictus Games began on Wednesday night with a rousing military-themed ceremony that celebrated the achievements of injured, wounded and sick servicemen and women. Prince Harry praised competitors, many still serving soldiers, from around the globe for their stories that 'move, inspire and humble'.

The prince told the 6,500 spectators who had watched the opening ceremony: 'No longer are these inspirational men and women defined by their injury but as athletes, competitors and team mates. 'Over the next four days we will see some truly remarkable achievements. For some of those taking part, this will be a stepping stone to elite sport but for others it will mark the end of a chapter in their recovery, and the beginning of a new one.' He ended with the passionate words; 'Finally, I would like to thank you for the tremendous example you set. Your stories move, inspire and humble us.

"Read Chief Sports Writer Martin Samuel's full column - including why Steven Gerrard will not return to Liverpool on loan . Many times we agonise over the state and status of the English game. Are we better than La Liga? Are we better than Bayern Munich? Maybe not, but think on this. In June 1995, Dennis Bergkamp signed for Arsenal after two difficult seasons with Inter Milan. His time there had deteriorated to such an extent that a newspaper giving a facetious award for the ‘Donkey of the Week’ renamed it ‘Bergkamp of the Week’. When Bergkamp left, Inter owner Massimo Moratti predicted he would not score 10 goals for Arsenal: the Italians could not believe they had got their money back. That is how it was then. English clubs were way down Europe’s pecking order, the dumping ground for rejects or players looking for a last pay day. The same year as Bergkamp joined Arsenal, 32-year-old Ruud Gullit signed for Chelsea on a free transfer, having suffered massive injuries. Paul Ince, one of the finest midfield players in the country, meanwhile, was sold by Manchester United to Inter Milan at the age of 27.

Lukas Podolski cannot get in the team at Arsenal, so where does he go? Inter Milan. He arrived in Italy on Friday to complete a loan deal with a view to a £5million transfer. Nemanja Vidic waited until approaching his 33rd birthday before swapping Manchester United for the San Siro, too. Now Adel Taarabt, who cannot get into Queens Park Rangers’ team, is holding out for his second loan move to AC Milan. The decline of the Milan giants — AC are seventh, Inter 11th coming out of Italy’s winter break — has been dramatic, but this shift in power runs deeper. Ashley Cole had played his best years in the Premier League and could not even make England’s team at the World Cup, so decamped to Roma. Italy’s relationship with English football has reversed. Real Madrid, Barcelona and Bayern Munich may be the might of Europe right now — but we forget how it once was for English clubs and how much has changed for us to even aspire to their level.","In the 1990s Italian football was more dominant than the English game .

"If you’re fed up of being fastidious about your depilation, you will be pleased to learn the hairy legs movement has arrived - and it's making waves on social media. Women around the globe are saying ‘no’ to waxing and shaving, instead posting proud pictures of their fluffy limbs online. One such online community, the Hairy Legs Club, is blazing a trail on tumblr, inviting women to post their photos to make a statement about social expectations of beauty. Scroll down for video . Furry legs and a furry friend: One of the proud posts from the Very Hairy Legs blog on tumblr . The caption on this post reads: 'My dog doesn't care!' Hot on the heels of the club, which has hundreds of posts, the 'Very Hairy Legs' blog has also launched on the site, where unshaven women of the world can unite against the razor. In her opening statement, the blog's pioneer, Sarah, told her followers: 'This blog is dedicated to females with very hairy legs. Let our legs be the champions!' And a flurry of pictures followed. One blogger, 'Pupmami', writes simply 'Ginger hairy legs', while others leave a more inspirational message. Along with an image of her unshaven legs, regular blogger 'Swankified' writes, 'I’m so glad I don’t feel ashamed of my natural body hair anymore!' - a sentiment echoed on hundreds of other posts.

Hairy and proud: A post on the very Hairy Legs Club by a 21-year-old blogger who has never shaved her legs . 'When I first stopped shaving my legs it took a while for me to feel confident about it,' Swankifield told the MailOnline. 'Seeing pictures of other women doing the same helped me get used to it. 'I guess I post mine now because I like them - I like the way they look and that they remind me I’m not obligated to do anything I don’t want with my body.' The blogger adds: 'Also, it’s nice to get support from the online community, considering people outside don’t really approve.' Judging by many of the other posts, that support and solidarity is felt my many.

A particularly poetic poster writes of her hirsute legs: ‘It just feels so nice to have them wave around in the pool or ocean.' She adds: ‘Everyone around me thinks they’re gross, but I feel it’s important for me to grow them out not only for myself on my journey to self-love and acceptance, but also for other people who might be ashamed of theirs as I once.

"Luxury Italian lingerie label La Perla has removed a mannequin displayed in front of its New York store, after a customer complained about its overly thin frame on Twitter. The discovery was made at the brand's SoHo store on Sunday, by passing customer Michael Rudoy, who snapped a photo of the skeletal mannequin and uploaded it with the caption: 'How does #LaPerla think ribs on a mannequin is ok?!' Within hours, a representative from La . Perla swooped in and removed the offending object, claiming in a . statement released on Twitter that it 'will not be used . again by any La Perla boutique.' Ribs on show: This mannequin (pictured) displaying jutting ribs and a concave stomach, was spotted by a customer in a New York store and promptly removed by La Perla following a Twitter outcry . 'We are in . the process of redesigning all La Perla stores with a new concept image . and the mannequins that are currently displayed in our U.S. stores will . no longer be used.' 'TERRIBLE!!!' responded one tweeter, from the Alliance for Eating Disorders in Florida, when the photo first emerged. 'It's not [ok] and I'm #NotBuyingIt' wrote another. Mr Rudoy's friend, Seth Matlins, a former ad executive who is a self-described 'advocate for truth-in-advertising' also weighed in on the topic, praising La Perla for it fast response. Skinny standards: La Perla's mannequins are typically very slender, with ribs also visible in this example, displayed in a different New York store front in 2011 . Slender: Cara Delevingne (pictured) fronted the label's Spring/Summer 2013 campaign, looking lithe in the sultry set of photos . 'Was told by @LaPerlaLingerie, who replied/acted quickly, that the mannequin's been removed' he tweeted yesterday. An hour later, he tweeted again. 'Impressed by @LaPerlaLingerie commitment to change. We all make mistakes - it's if/how we fix them that counts.' The luxury label, whose bras start at $98 and run up to over $300 each, has more than 100 boutiques globally. Supermodel Cara Delevingne fronted their Spring/Summer 2013 campaign, looking lithe in a series of sultry shots. Luxury: La Perla's lingerie (pictured) is sold in over 100 boutiques worldwide and ranges from $98 to over $300 for a single bra . And it's not just La Perla that has come under fire for promoting its clothing on stick-thin mannequins. Psychotherapist Dae Sheridan was shocked when she came across a mannequin in a J.C. Penney store near her home in Florida in 2012, with matchstick narrow legs. 'We are in the process of redesigning all . La Perla stores with a new concept image and the mannequins that are . currently displayed in our US stores will no longer be used' 'The legs on the mannequin were not just “super-skinny”, they were extraordinarily, shockingly thin.  So thin, that the mannequin’s leg was the same size as my arm!' Ms Sheridan wrote in a 2012 online petition, which garnered over 7,500 signatures but was never addressed by J.C. Penney. Gap, Zara and Club Monaco have also been lambasted for similar offenses in the past, with Spanish label Mango agreeing in 2007 not to display any mannequins smaller than a size 6, citing 'problems with eating disorders among Spanish women.' MailOnline contacted a representative for La Perla and is expecting a response shortly.","The luxury lingerie label announced that the mannequin will not be displayed again in any of its U.S. boutiques .

"Planning on stealing someone else's partner? You might want to rethink that in the light of new research. While 'mate poaching' is incredibly common, three separate studies examined whether luring someone away from another results in a healthy, long-term relationship. Tracey says that if you've got your eyes on someone who is spoken for you could be in for a bumpy relationship . The answer in a nutshell is no. Poached partners tend to be in more dysfunctional relationships, make less reliable mates and are less satisfied and committed than people who were single and available when you met. They're also (surprise, surprise) more likely to cheat and had more narcissistic traits. Not quite such an attractive option after all. What astounds me, is that people ever thought it was. I never quite believe it when married guys claim they get hit on far more frequently when sporting a wedding ring, than without. (Is this really true?) If someone is already taken - and by that I mean dating, living with or married to someone else - surely that not only makes them off limits but far less appealing. Not wanting to point out the obvious but how can you trust someone who left someone else for you? Unsurprisingly poached partners are more likely to be repeat cheats, a new study has shown . Poached partner/affair-inspired relationships are nearly always riddled with insecurity and suspicion - for good reason. If you stole them, you know they're capable of cheating because they've done it with you. You've been there when they've claimed to be somewhere innocent, one hand holding their mobile and the other sliding up your thigh. So when they call to tell you they're working late, your first thought is 'Are they really? What if they're doing that to me' It's a lose-lose situation that doesn't work on either side: whether you're the person doing the stealing or the one being stolen. 'Poaching' is often done by people with low self-esteem. Taking someone else's partner 'proves' they are attractive, sexy and loveable after all. Tracey doesn't believe the saying 'you can't help who you fall in love with' and says that we can control our feelings . Trouble is, that newfound confidence and security quickly drains away once the high of hooking them wears off - so they set off in search of another target, in search of another high. Sometimes leaving the person they tempted (who isn't in the habit of leaving for pastures new), staring bewildered at a ravaged life - shattered marriage, devastated children and nothing to show for it but being made to look like an idiot. I'm aware (and know personally) of cases where women and men have fallen for other people's partners, tried to fight the attraction but can't, been genuinely remorseful and years later, are still together and happy. But I still don't believe it when people say 'You can't help who you fall in love with'. You can. We all know, pretty early on, when we're attracted to someone. If that someone happens to be out of bounds (attached, a boss, your best friend's boyfriend), the decent thing to do is recognise there is an attraction and avoid circumstances which would allow it to develop. This means not going for drinks after work when that unfairly sexy married man is part of the group; opting out of the friendly invitation to 'pop out for a coffee' with the stunning married neighbour who always seems to have a few too many buttons undone. We fall in lust and love (usually in that order) when we allow ourselves to. It doesn't 'just happen', we've allowed it to happen. It's like the booze-fuelled one-night-stand that 'meant nothing because we were both drunk'. There's a point in the evening when you face yourself in the mirror, realise you're tipsy as hell, flirting like mad and can't be trusted to behave yourself. Go straight back in and order another G & T and you might as well strip naked and do it right up there on the bar. Who we fall in love with isn't out of our control, it's a choice. Given the end result of hooking up with someone attached is a rubbish relationship with pathetic chances of success, isn't it more sensible to focus on those who are free and able to offer a real chance at happiness?

"Not sure whether to chuckle, feel horrified or jealous of the hordes of Dutch middle-aged people apparently having drug-fuelled orgies, the news got me thinking. The reason why this story made headlines is age: if it was about horny 20 years olds, we’d yawn and click on something else. It’s the fact that it’s 45 year olds having rampant sex that makes us sit up and pay attention. (They’re still having sex at that age? Dear God, how disgusting!) Tracey says that sex in our teens can be exciting but can also be awkward and not quite what it's cracked up to be . But is it really that shocking? The answer to this question will be completely skewed by what age and generation you are but at what age do you have the best sex of your life? Here’s my take on it: . Late teens: . Pros: It’s hit-or-miss, fumbly and lacking in technique but more than makes up for it in ‘firsts’. The first time you’re touched there, your first orgasm - and all this coupled with the first time you fall in love. Hormones are raging, so you feel everything intently and exquisitely. Cons: Losing your virginity isn’t quite what it’s cracked up to be. Lots of women, especially, feel desperately disappointed by their first time - me included. Sex is massively hyped and I had high expectations. Plus, I really didn’t have a clue what was going to happen. When my boyfriend moved on top of me, I wondered what the hell was going on. I knew what went where but had no idea people moved while doing it! Despite the fact that older age cam pose a few health complications, Tracey says that many elderly couples still enjoy regular and satisfying sex . In your 20s: . Pros: If you’re single and playing the field, you reap all the benefits of single sex. Single sex is all about anticipation: the split second before it happens, the moment before you’re about to kiss/bed the person you’ve been fantasising about for weeks/months/three minutes. You’ve never been with this person before - and the erotic part of the human brain doesn’t half like the ‘newness’ factor. Your 20s is also often when you experience sexual nirvana: great sex with someone you’re also very much in love with. If you’re balancing electric, erotic sex with lots of soppy stuff, it doesn’t get much better, surely? Cons: If you haven’t found someone special, casual sex is unlikely to stay sexy long-term because it’s generally selfish: you’re both out for your own pleasure. Even if it’s not that bad, it can still feel pretty empty and pointless lying there with someone you don’t know and don’t particularly want to know. In your 30s: . Pros: This is the settle down and have kids period. Some women maintain the best sex of their life is during pregnancy; absolutely no-one ever lays claim to having great sex with small kids in the house. Babies have inbuilt sex radars and are guaranteed to cry at the mere hint of a sexy snog or erect penis. Tracey says that great sex can be have right up until your 70s and even beyond that . Cons: You face a harsh reality: while you’d have killed for sex-on-tap while single, once it’s just a matter of turning over, it isn’t half as appealing. Parenthood strips the will to live, let alone love. Most couples rather sensibly make do with perfunctory sex for the first few years after a newborn. In your 40s: . Pros: The children need less of your time which has a spin-off. Some couples make a pact to put the effort in and rescue a stale sex life, rediscovering the sex they used to have and more. (In our 40s we’re more confident and likely to speak up about what we really need and want in bed.) The second outcome is you both decide while you’re well up for more sex but would prefer it wasn’t with each other. Enter the middle-aged Dutch swingers (see above), spreading STI’s willy-nilly and generally behaving like over-sexed adolescents. Cons: More than half of men aged between 40 and 70 will experience some degree of erectile dysfunction. Men find this most unsettling but for women, it can be a plus. There’s more emphasis on foreplay and oral sex and less focus on penetration. In your 50s: . Pros: This is when having the right partner and the right attitude is crucial. Around 42% of couples aged 45-55 and married for ten years or more still have sex weekly. The amount you have it and how much you enjoy it, is strongly related to how happy you are with each other. Some find sleeping with the same person forever a negative, others a plus. Cons: Menopause is a b****ch for lots of women. Low testosterone means loss of desire, weight gain, being too wet in the wrong bits (night sweats), too dry in others (vaginally). Not surprisingly, a lot of women decide to give sex the swerve completely. Others rewrite the rule book and move onto gentler, more intimate sex which turns out to be just as satisfying as the raw, urgent sex of old. In your 60s: . Pros: Plenty of older people find sex in their later years is the best ever. If you don’t believe me, get a copy of a brilliant book called ‘Better than Ever: Time for Love and Sex’ that challenges many of the myths about sex and ageing. Cons: Health problems can take their toll but if you’re able to humour each other about ageing, it’s possible to work around potential problems (pillows - to pad, prop and support - become your new favourite sex aid). In your 70s and beyond: . Pros: Research suggests plenty of people 70-plus rate their sex lives as ‘very satisfying’. The orgasm quota isn’t what it was, but sex is slow, sensual and high on snuggling and cuddling. Cons: ‘The Wheelbarrow’ might be something used in the garden, rather than attempted in the bedroom, but if you’re still having regular orgasms at this age, I say you win hands down!

"Alex Salmond is planning a visit to watch the Ryder Cup golf tournament within days of breaking up the 300-year-old Union. The Scottish First Minister revealed that if he secures victory in his battle for independence, he will travel to Gleneagles to watch the likes of Rory McIlroy and Tom Watson teeing off. After dire warnings that Yes vote could trigger economic catastrophe, No campaigners accused Mr Salmond of embarking on a 'premature victory lap' instead of answering key questions about how independence would work in practice. First Minister Alex Salmond, pictured watching the Ryder Cup in Illinois in 2012, has admitted he plans a day out at the tournament at Gleneagles just days after the independence referendum . Mr Salmond, a keen golfer, suggested that whatever the outcome of the referendum on September 18 he will not miss the Ryder Cup, which starts just five days later at the Gleneagles Hotel in Perthshire. He also insisted that he will abide by the result, and if Scots vote No there will not be another referendum on independence for a generation. But the revelation that his mind is on golf will draw comparisons with David Cameron and his reputation for being a 'chillaxing' Prime Minister. Mr Salmond today appeared on BBC1's Andrew Marr Show to set out his latest pitch for independence. He insisted that if he loses Thursday's vote, he will not try to force another referendum. 'If you remember previous constitutional referenda in Scotland, there was one in 1979 and the next one was 1997. Mr Salmond's wife Moira has reportedly encouraged him to play golf during the independence campaign to help clear his head . 'That's what I mean by a political generation… This is a once in a generation, perhaps even a once in a lifetime opportunity for Scotland.' In the interview Mr Marr asked Mr Salmond about the prospect of voters backing independence, 'you presumably have a malt, a round of golf and then what happens?' Extraordinarily, Mr Salmond said: 'I'll probably go to the Ryder Cup the following week, I'm not sure about the malt.' Mr Salmond's wife Moria is reportedly credited with encouraging the First Minister to regularly take time out from the referendum campaign to play golf to 'unwind and clear his head', according to the Sunday Times. It also emerged that Mr Salmond was playing against the 14-year-old son of the greenkeeper at Castle Stuart golf course overlooking the Moray Firth when news broke of an opinion poll putting the Yes campaign ahead last weekend. Today Mr Salmond went on to insist that there will be 'urgent business following a Yes victory on Friday', adding: 'Firstly I think it will be a day of celebration, Scotland will have achieved something astonishing in democratic politics. 'But there's a lot of business to do. And the first and urgent business is to bring Scotland together. 'Because on Friday, after a Yes vote there'll cease to be a Yes campaign and a No campaign. There'll be a Team Scotland. And I've said very clearly that I want into that Team Scotland as many voices as possible, people who have got something to offer and contribute to bring the country together.' But Alistair Darling, leader of the Better Together campaign, accused Mr Salmond of doing a 'premature victory lap' ahead of polling day. He told the BBC: 'We still don't know how we can ensure that we don't lose jobs, with firms saying they are going to take their headquarters out of Scotland – that would be a disaster for Scotland. 'We still don't know how we are going to replace the additional funding we get for the National Health Service. 'We don't know who is going to pay pensions and you were asking Alex Salmond a few moments ago about currency and he seemed to be doing a rather premature victory lap even before most of us have voted. 'But he was just simply asserting that low and behold on Friday morning, everybody else is wrong, they are all going to fall in line with what he is going to say.' Mr Salmond has previously faced criticism for spending £7,000 of taxpayers' money on a visit to Chicago for the Ryder Cup in 2012. He stayed in a suite in the five-star Peninsula Hotel, popular with celebrities such as Brad Pitt, which included a guest powder room, living room, a dressing area, three TVs, a video games console, a surround-sound stereo system and a marble bathroom. Better Together leader Alistair Darling accused Mr Salmond of being on a 'premature victory lap' instead of answering questions about what independence would mean in practice . Mr Salmond would have been treated to panoramic views of Michigan Avenue, one of Chicago's main thoroughfares, and the city's historic Water Tower Park. The SNP leader, who was accompanied by three officials, has refused to disclose how much he spent on this weeklong jaunt, dismissing criticism as 'ridiculous frippery'. But the majority of the 'Team Scotland' delegation in the US at the same time stayed in a more modest hotel near the Medinah golf course, which charges £60 for a room. The entire trip cost taxpayers nearly £500,000. David Cameron decided against spending the weekend campaigning in Scotland to instead attend a society wedding in Hampshire . With the clock ticking on the countdown to the crunch vote on the future of the Union, Mr Cameron chose not to spend the weekend in Scotland and yesterday attended a society wedding south of the border. The PM mingled with well-heeled guests in the Hampshire village of Northington, where Samantha's half-brother Jake Astor married Victoria Hargreaves. The younger son of Viscount Astor and his wife Annabel, 33-year-old Jake is an Old Etonian who studied at Oxford University and works as a Mandarin-speaking investment analyst, while his wife is a consultant for a luxury brand. The couple were thrown a pre-wedding reception in Downing Street two days ago, laid on by the Prime Minister's wife. They are part of the aristocratic Astor family, descended from the 19th Century fur trader and America's first multi-millionaire John Jacob Astor. Yesterday's wedding came just weeks after Mr Cameron faced criticism for returning to the Cornish surf hours after a crisis meeting about a British jihadi beheading journalist James Foley.","4million Scots to take part in independence referendum on September 18 .

"A witness was able to videotape a violent attack against a park ranger by a skateboarder in a Philadelphia park on Friday. Police are investigating the violent encounter that occurred in LOVE Park at around 5 p.m. Mariano Verrico of Essex Fells, New Jersey managed to capture the horrific event 'over a no skateboard rule' on film. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Hands up: The witness said the park ranger merely lifted his hands in self defense after the skateboarder threatened him with violence . Pushed: The skateboarder aggressively wrestles the park ranger to the ground . 'He got kicked in the head repeatedly and spit on,' Verrico told NBC. 'When he was down towards the end..., the one kid who did everything leaned down and spit on him. It was really disgraceful.' Mariano was visiting Philadelphia for the day with his cousins when he overheard a park ranger telling some men that they had to stop skateboarding in the park because there were too many young children. 'Basically he was just doing his job,' Verrico said. 'His voice wasn't raised. He wasn't cursing.' Verrico said that the park ranger was merely acting in self defense against the man and while he kept his arms in the air, he never once hit the skateboarder. Using force: The skateboarder kicks the park ranger several times in the neck and shoulder . Not over yet: The skateboarder gives the park ranger a hard kick to the head . 'He never once tried to fight with the kid,' he said. 'He never threw any type of punch at the kid or said anything negative.' The skateboarder threw a punch at the ranger who fell down onto his back. The skateboarder then proceeds to kick the park ranger several times in the leg and then in the head. As though kicking the ranger weren't disrespectful enough, the skateboarder finishes off the ranger by spitting on him. Once the shameful beating was over, Verrico escorted the park ranger to a Philadelphia Police station to show the video to the police. Police were unaware of the incident and are now attempting to find the suspect. Even though skateboarding is banned in LOVE Park, staff are working on including a legal skate spot as they plan a redesign for the popular Philadelphia destination. Finale: At the end of the brutal attack, the skateboarder spits on the park ranger's head .","The suspect has not yet been identified .

"It has grounded planes, closed roads and even been compared to a nuclear winter, but one couple were not going to let the smog in Beijing ruin their big day. In an apparent protest against the heavy pollution, the couple added gas masks to their more traditional wedding outfits before posing for a series of shots around Guomao Bridge in the Chinese capital. Severe pollution has hit much of northern China for the past week, with some readings well over 10 times the internationally accepted safety limit. Scroll down for video . A Chinese couple pose in wedding outfits and gas masks in the smog in Beijing .

Severe pollution has hit much of northern China for the past week, with some readings well over 10 times the internationally accepted safety limit . The smog in Beijing is now so thick that it is blocking sunlight despite recent announced closures or production cuts at 147 of the city's industrial plants. He Dongxian from China Agricultural University’s College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, has even compared its effects to that of a nuclear winter. It has been predicted that if enough nuclear bombs were detonated, so many particles would be thrown into the air that the sun could be blocked out enough to alter the weather and damage the food supply. Dongxian has said that process is now underway in Beijing and six northern provinces. She warned that the toxic smog is hindering photosynthesis of plants and that if it lingers much longer, it could affect food production, according to The Guardian.

He Dongxian from China Agricultural University's College of Water Resources and Civil Engineering, has compared the effects of the smog to that of a nuclear winter . Dongxian demonstrated recently that seedlings in Beijing were taking over twice as long to grow as those in a lab. ‘Every farm is caught in a smog panic,’ she told The South China Morning Post. Pollution has been so severe that aircraft have been grounded, roads closed and tourists numbers hit, while the direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing on Tuesday had alarming results. It was reported that the level of PM 2.5 particles, a key measure of pollution because they are small enough to be assimilated into the blood stream, reached 505 micrograms per cubic metre, far higher than the maximum level it considers to be safe, which is 25. China's environment ministry has vowed to 'harshly punish' factories and power plants that contributed to the hazardous smog . The smog has led to public displays of dissatisfaction, including people placing anti-pollution face masks on statues . The direct danger posed to human health was underlined by the World Health Organisation, whose readings in Beijing on Tuesday had alarming results . China's environment ministry has vowed to 'harshly punish' factories and power plants that contributed to the hazardous smog, official state media reported on Wednesday. Investigations had found that some thermal power plants, cement and steel makers in the northern province of Hebei had failed to halt or curtail production during severely smoggy days despite government orders, state news agency Xinhua quoted the Ministry of Environmental Protection as saying. The smog has led to public displays of dissatisfaction, including people placing anti-pollution face masks on statues.

Pedestrians wear protective masks as they cross a road in smog in Beijing . In Beijing, which was shrouded in stinking smog for more than a week, authorities raised the pollution alert to the second-highest 'orange' danger level for the first time on Friday after drawing public ire for its ineffective response. The noxious haze, which can cause lung cancer, abated Wednesday evening, just before China's leaders gather for next week's National People's Congress Meeting. China will introduce measures to combat the smog, including constructing 12 electricity 'channels' to bring in energy from farther away, Xinhua also reported on Wednesday, to reduce the reliance on pollution-creating power plants in northern and eastern China.","Couple wore gas masks while posing in wedding outfits in Chinese capital .

"Villagers took part in a four-hour stand-off to successfully fend off travellers from their green - but not before police warned they could be charged with false imprisonment for confronting them. About 11 caravans drove in to the village of Nepcote, near Findon, West Sussex, shortly after 2pm yesterday. Fifty residents then surrounded the village green - blocking the only entrance to the space with their cars. Although some vehicles got through the human blockade, the villagers managed to block a majority of the caravans. Scroll down for video . Residents in Nepcote, Findon, West Sussex formed a human blockade around their village green (pictured) after a group of travellers descended on the area . About 50 residents (some pictured) blocked the only entrance to the green - meaning no others could enter the space. The travellers (in the background) were handed an eviction order by police and they moved on last night . After several hours, their campaign was finally victorious - with police serving an eviction notice forcing the group to move on. However, during the tense stand-off some villagers were warned by officers they could be charged with false imprisonment for blocking the group in. When asked whether West Sussex Police had warned residents they could be hit with false imprisonment charges, a spokeswoman said: 'Officers spent time in Findon on Tuesday engaging with the community and travellers who arrived during the morning. 'At some point there were vehicles blocking the access to Nepcote Green, preventing the travellers from leaving. 'Owners of those vehicles were given advice by officers as to their actions and the travellers were able to leave the area without incident. The shift response by officers has been praised by residents.' The episode comes just two weeks after another group of travellers invaded a recreation ground near Horsdean, Brighton - just 23 miles away. More than 30 locals took to the Horsdean Recreation Ground in Vale Avenue, Brighton, to block eight vans from entering the site. The travellers, who had been evicted from Wild Park in Moulsecoomb earlier the same day, were moved on at around 10pm. One eyewitness today described the scene in Nepcote - where last year a group of travellers moved in and caused £8,000-worth of damage - last night. The group of about 11 caravans and residents pictured on the village green. Locals said they were warned by police they could be charged with false imprisonment for blocking in the group . More of the group pictured on the village green. Peter Goldsworthy, chairman of Findon parish Council, said he was 'absolutely delighted' the group had been removed yesterday . He said: 'They [the drivers] turned up and drove on to the green right in the middle of the village. 'The villagers took it upon themselves to fight and not let anyone go on. They blocked the only entrance - which had been locked - and wouldn't let anyone else on. 'They would let them get through. 'Police eventually managed to get rid of them. It was a great result. 'Apparently the police told the locals they were going to have to move as it is false imprisonment on the behalf of the travellers.' Peter Goldsworthy, chairman of Findon parish Council, said he was ‘absolutely delighted’ the group had been removed. He told the Worthy Herald: 'The local police persuaded the assistant chief constable to grant an eviction order at around 8pm.The travellers insisted on seeing the eviction order but were gone by 9pm.' Resident David Gear told the paper: 'It was absolutely brilliant. Around 50 villagers were present to make sure that the travellers left, along with the police. They used all sorts of delaying tactics. Another group moved in to the Horsdean Recreation Ground, pictured, near Brighton just two weeks ago. They were met by scores of locals - who blocked some of them out of the area . The group were moved on by police just hours after they arrived following the stand-off (pictured) 'We celebrated afterwards with burgers and tea and coffee. It was like the old war-time spirit.' Judith Davies, chairman of Findon Village Hall said: 'They have blocked the road and the police are there in force. It’s so disappointing because of the money that’s been spent and the efforts of all the villagers to prevent this from happening.' Of the incident yesterday, Sussex Police said: 'At 2.45pm on Tuesday police were informed that a group of travellers in about 11 vehicles had entered Nepcote Green at Findon Village. 'Officers attended and are remaining at the site, liaising with the parish council, and assessing the situation. 'Early on Tuesday evening, police served a Notice under Section 61 of the Criminal Justice & Public Order Act 1994 on the travellers at Nepcote Green and they all left shortly after 8pm. There was no disorder and there were no arrests.' Police confirmed today the travellers moved on after they were handed a section 61 order asking for them to move. The group had been evicted from Wild Park in Moulsecoomb earlier the same day . Of the Horsdean incident, a police spokesperson said: 'Police were called to a report of a group of travellers arriving in Horsdean Park Recreation Ground. 'Some of them had been part of a large group moved on from Wild Park on Wednesday afternoon after a section 61 order was served on them requiring them to leave. 'About 12 vehicles and eight caravans got on to the ground, upsetting residents. Police attended the site immediately and early consideration for a further direction under a section 61 order was undertaken. 'Officers remained at the site to prevent a breach of the peace.'","Group of travellers descended on Nepcote, West Sussex, at 2pm yesterday .

"Forty-seven million years ago, a pregnant mare drank from a lake that may have poisoned her with its deadly volcanic gases. Now, her remarkably well-preserved body has been recovered by palaeontologists working in the Messel Pit, a former coal, in Darmstadt, Germany. The fossilised remains of the mare and her unborn foal are providing scientists with new insights into these ancient creatures. Forty-seven million years ago, a pregnant mare drank from a lake that may have poisoned her with its deadly volcanic gases. Now, her remarkably well-preserved body has been recovered by palaeontologists working in the Messel Pit, a former coal, in Darmstadt, Germany. The ringed area shows her unborn foal . They reveal that, despite great differences in their size and shape, ancient horses had very similar reproduction to modern horses. These ancient creatures, known as Eurohippus messelensism had four toes on each forefoot and three toes on each the hind foot, and it was about the size of a modern fox terrier. 'Almost all of the bones of the foetus are still articulated in their original position. Only the skull is crushed,' said Dr Jens Lorenz Franzen of the Senckenberg Research Institute, lead author of the study. The specimen was discovered by a team from the Senckenberg Research Institute nearly 15 years ago, but its extent was not fully appreciated until it was studied using micro X-ray. These ancient creatures, known as Eurohippus messelensism had four toes on each forefoot and three toes on each the hind foot, and it was about the size of a modern fox terrier. Artist's impression pictured . The micro X-ray analysis revealed a structure known as the broad ligament that connects the uterus to the backbone and helps support the developing foal. Remnants of the wrinkled outer uterine wall became visible after the specimen was prepared, a feature shared between Eurohippus and modern horses. The specimen was well-preserved due to the oil shales at Grube Messel, which have long been known for their intricate fossils. Modern racehorses are virtually all descended from a legendary British stallion called Eclipse (artist's impression pictured) Modern racehorses are virtually all descended from a legendary British stallion called Eclipse, a study confirmed last year. Researchers found racehorses have far less variability of male chromosomes than other domestic animals do. They also confirmed that almost all English Thoroughbreds contain DNA from the famous stallion Eclipse. It has long been known that the female DNA – mitochondrial DNA – in modern horses is extremely diverse but, until recently, essentially no sequence diversity had been detected on the Y chromosome – the male DNA - of the domestic horse. Foaled during and named after the solar eclipse of 1 April 1764, Eclipse was an undefeated 18th-century British Thoroughbred racehorse who won 18 races, including 11 King's Plates. Super stallion Eclipse's descendants include Kauto Star and Desert Orchid and almost all thoroughbred racehorses. These oil shales formed at the bottom of ancient Lake Messel and preserve the remains of mammals, birds, and other animals that were living near what is now Darmstadt, Germany about 47 million years ago. No oxygen was present at the bottom of the lake when the dead animals sank down and finally became embedded in the muddy sediments. Pictured is a comparison between a modern day horse and the Eurohippus which lived 47 million years ago . There, anaerobic bacteria immediately began to decompose skin, muscles, and other soft tissues. As a result, the bacteria produced carbon dioxide, which in turn precipitated iron ions present in the lake water. As a result, the organ was not fossilised directly, but is visible as a dark shadow left by bacteria that consumed the tissue and then were fossilised. The size of the fetus and the presence of fully developed milk teeth indicate that it was close to term when it and its mother died. But its position in the uterus indicates that the two did not die during the birthing process. The fetus was upside down rather than right side up, and its front legs were not yet extended as they should be just before birth. This is only the second example of a fossil where the placenta can be identified, researchers claim. The fossil was preserved in the oil shales at Grube Messel in Darmstadt, close to Frankfurt in Germany .","Fossil was preserved in the oil shales at Grube Messel in Darmstadt .

"Danniella Westbrook (40) and Tom Richards (24) might not be a shining example of a summer autumn Relationship, but it’s a combination that can make perfect sense. In the past, scientists stuck to the evolutionary theory that men prefer younger women who are likely to bear them more children. Not so. Results of one landmark study showed men don’t really care how old a woman is, it’s what she looks like that counts. (Hang your head, you shallow creatures!) Tracey says that whether it's power, charisma - or the fact that they’re a good lay - the older woman is hot property . While there’s an obvious downside to this (the good-looking really do rule the earth), the upside for single thirty-forty-(or even fifty)-somethings is you don’t need to be quite as panicked about ageing as you think. In this particular study, a group of twenty-something men consistently chose a picture of an attractive forty-something woman over photos of lots of other younger, if plainer, women. It wasn’t just for sex either – the men were asked to think white-picket fences rather than a Fifty Shades style fling. Whether it's power, charisma - or the fact that they’re a damn good lay - the older woman is hot property. So the next time you’re stressing about wrinkles or arms that continue waving when you’ve stopped, remind yourself of these six reasons which make you hotter than Cara Delevingne... Tracey says that older women tend to have not only more experience but more confidence in the bedroom . Why older women make great lovers . You know what you're doing . By the time most sexually adventurous women hit 30, they've not only clocked up more than a few lovers, they've been in a number of different sexual situations. Like anything, the more experience you have at something, the better you are at it. Over the years, the older woman has dealt with penises that won’t go up, down, or do both. She’s had lovers who needed their left shin tickled to get turned on, those who needed instruction on just about everything - and some who've taught her a thing or two. Her younger counterpart might have breasts that point to heaven but an older woman will keep you floating on cloud nine through sheer sexual knowledge. You take charge . Because of the age difference, you both assume roles. The older partner invariably becomes ‘teacher’; the younger partner ‘pupil’. While this can be annoying and restrictive out of bed, it somehow works while in it. Plenty of women still lie back and expect the guy to do all the work. If she takes the lead and becomes the sexual aggressor, it’s an automatic penis-pumper. You take your time . It usually takes women a little longer to get warmed up than he does. Older woman don’t apologise for this, they make the most of it, knowing a slower, longer sex session is liable to be a lot more enjoyable for both of you. You respond . You’re also more likely to exhibit the biggest turn-on of all - responsiveness. He really would rather have dimpled thighs that quiver, than a perfectly smooth set that don’t move an inch! Many men name responsiveness as an even bigger turn-on than beauty. You're confident . A confident lover is always in demand - no matter what she looks like. In fact, plenty of therapists say it’s an older woman’s sexual confidence which is at the heart of her appeal to younger men. You're not scared to give directions . If there's just one other piece of advice on sex a young girl should take from an older woman it's this: you won't get what you want in bed unless you ask for it. Lots of young woman refuse to guide their lovers because they feel he should ""know"" what to do - or fear that he'll see any instruction as criticism. The truth is, most men love forthright, confident women and would positively relish a more hands-on approach!

"Steven Salaita, pictured, has reportedly lost his job at a top university in America following anti-Israel comments he posted on Twitter . A ‘brilliant and ethical’ professor has lost his job at a major U.S. university over his anti-Israel remarks on Twitter, it has been claimed. Steven Salaita had been offered a role at the University of Illinois on the American Indian Studies course – and the appointment was expected to be confirmed. But according to the Huffington Post, there have been reports that his outspoken criticism of Israel’s part in the Gaza conflict may have cost him his job. In one Tweet he told his followers: 'It's simple: either condemn #Israel's actions or embrace your identity as someone who's okay with the wholesale slaughter of children.’ Another read: 'Only #Israel can murder around 300 children in the span of a few weeks and insist that it is the victim.' On the same day he wrote: 'It's quite simple, really: don't support any ideology whose practice results in dead children.' According to the Huffington Post, the university has yet to comment on why the appointment was blocked. But it states that the Inside Higher Ed and the Daily Gazette have reported his controversial anti-Israel tweets were the reason he has not been taken on by the Urbana-Champaign based university. Supporters of Mr Salaita, who was previously working as an associate professor in the English department at Virginia Tech University, have already set up a petition on the website Change.org urging bosses at the university to reverse their decision. More than 9,000 have already backed the petition which demands the ‘immediate reinstatement’ of a ‘brilliant, ethical, and prolific’ professor.

"Scottish spirit: Helena Bonham Carter has signed the letter . Sir Cliff Richard, Dame Judi Dench and Sir Mick Jagger yesterday joined an extraordinary list of celebrities signing a ‘love letter’ to the people of Scotland – pleading with them not to break up the 300-year-old union. But the signatories were immediately bombarded with abusive remarks from supporters of independence who branded them ‘imperialists’, ‘uber-toffs’ and ‘irrelevant’. More than 200 public figures – including Helena Bonham Carter, Dame Vera Lynn, Simon Cowell, Professor Stephen Hawking and Sir Bruce Forsyth – urged Scotland to vote No to leaving the UK in the letter that said: ‘Let’s stay together.’ The stars immediately became the target of so-called ‘cybernats’, or nationalist internet bullies. One wrote that Sir Bruce was ‘nearly dead’, while another said they hoped ‘that old **** Bruce Forsyth takes a turn’ and accused him of being a paedophile. The letter, which was organised by The One Show historian Dan Snow, states: ‘The decision on whether to leave our shared country is, of course, absolutely yours alone. ‘We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them.’ Presenting the letter near Tower Bridge in London, Mr Snow said he hoped tens of thousands of supporters across the country would add their names to it online. Mr Snow, son of former BBC election night star Peter Snow, said: ‘I feel passionately about Britain and everything we’ve achieved together throughout our long shared history across these islands. ‘This letter is for people who don’t have a vote in the referendum … they want to simply say we are not telling you how to vote but when you do vote we hope you don’t go. ‘I think some things are too important to be left to politicians. This is the biggest potential change to our county for generations and it will affect generations to come.’ Scroll down for video and the full list . Sir Mick Jagger, Dame Judi Dench and Sir Bruce Forsyth yesterday joined an extraordinary list of celebrities . Sir David Attenborough and Simon Cowell are among more than 200 celebrities on the list . TV historian Dan Snow, who launched the letter in London yesterday, told MailOnline it was the 'most extraordinary list that has ever been compiled in modern British political history' Signatories from the world of music include Sir Cliff Richard, Sting and Bryan Ferry . Actress Olivia Colman is among those telling Scottish voters she would like them to reject independence . Actors on the list include Tom Hollander (left), Simon Callow and Rob Brydon (right) Among the 215 famous names to have signed the letter are Olympic stars Sir Ben Ainslie, Tom Daley and Sir Steve Redgrave, broadcasters Sir David Attenborough and Sir Michael Parkinson and Hollywood stars Sir Patrick Stewart and Michael Douglas. Lord Lloyd-Webber, Sting, Kirstie Allsopp, Mary Beard, Cilla Black, Dickie Bird, Gyles Brandreth, Tracey Emin, Gloria Hunniford, Alan Titchmarsh, Esther Rantzen and Olivia Colman are also on the list, along with comedians David Walliams, Ronnie Corbett and Eddie Izzard. Dear Friend, . The decision on whether to leave our shared country is, of course, absolutely yours alone. Nevertheless, that decision will have a huge effect on all of us in the rest of the United Kingdom. We want to let you know how very much we value our bonds of citizenship with you, and to express our hope that you will vote to renew them. What unites us is much greater than what divides us. Let's stay together. Yours, . The Rest of the United Kingdom . Baroness Lawrence, whose teenage son Stephen was murdered by racists in 1993, has also backed the campaign. Pro-independence campaigners have become known for their nasty online attacks on high-profile supporters of the union, including author JK Rowling. Yesterday, the ‘cybernats’ accused Mr Snow and presenter Ben Fogle, who joined him at the launch, of being ‘two white middle-class English public school boys telling us how to live our lives’. They tweeted a doctored image of Mr Snow holding up a placard that read: ‘Together we can ensure my father-in-law remains the richest man in the UK.’ Mr Snow’s wife, Lady Edwina Grosvenor, is the daughter of the Duke of Westminster, who is the tenth richest man in the country with a fortune of £8.5billion.

"Mr All-I-need-is-a-pet-pig Clooney finally relinquished his treasured bachelor lifestyle when he married Amal Alamuddin last weekend. His choice of wife was (predictably) impeccable - she is elegant, beautiful, intelligent and powerful. If I had to pick a bride worthy of the world’s sexiest and respected bachelor, she’d be up there. Scroll down for video . Tracey says that she thinks that Amal and George were a little hasty getting married so soon after meeting . What was interesting, though, was his timing. After clinging onto his single status for 53 years and being consistently vocal about the joys of being a bachelor, George ended up meeting and marrying Amal within one year. He proposed after seven months and they married within twelve. Am I the only one that thinks this was uncharacteristically speedy? When I suggest it was all a bit rushed, I get answers like ‘he was swept off his feet’, he knew he’d met ‘The One’, it was ‘love at first sight’ but he forced himself to wait. Personally, I’d have been far more convinced this was the real deal if George had met and dated the human rights lawyer for a few years, had a few kids and then dropped to one knee and whisked her off to Venice. I’ve been to marriages of good friends when I haven’t even had time to meet the groom (six weeks in) and marriages of friends who’ve been together for more than a decade. It’s the latter that I find impressive. Tracey says that the length of time that you've known a person before marriage is a good indicator of how long it will last . True love is wanting to shout to the world that you love someone when you’ve lived with their faults, seen all their disgusting habits, know their moods and eccentricities and heard the same stories 500 times over and still nod and smile in all the right places. Whirlwind, rollercoaster-ride marriages of couples who meet and marry within weeks don’t impress me in the slightest. I’d have been married about 20 times if I’d done it in the first few months of the relationship! It’s easy to say ‘I do’ when your brain has been hi-jacked by the highly intoxicating love hormones turning anyone half decent into an air-brushed, glamorised version of themselves. True, Clooney’s courtship is longer than lots of other celebrities. When stacked against the courtship periods of Kim Kardashian and Kris Humphries (whose marriage lasted 72 days), Britney Spears and Jason Alexander (55 hours), Nicolas Cage and Lisa Marie Presley (107 days), Pamela Anderson and Kid Rock (122 days) and Jennifer Lopez and Cris Judd (218 days), he’s positively dragged his feet. But Clooney’s got kudos and clout, he’s intelligent and articulate and apart from a bit of indiscriminate snogging in bars when hanging out with mates like Brad Pitt and Matt Damon, appears to be of sound judgement. Forty to 50 percent of marriages don’t last. How long you’ve known each other before you marry is a strong predicting factor of whether it will succeed. The longer the acquaintance, the more likely the marriage will be successful and couples who’ve known each other for longer than a year fair better than those who haven’t. People who’ve known each other for two, have even more chance of making it. It’s easy to be swept up into seemingly fairytale scenarios: Russell Brand is about as genuine as that Jimmy Choo handbag on offer on ebay for £20 but I still had Aw-like feelings when I read quotes from him and Katy Perry in their first six love-struck months. One year into their marriage, he dumped her by text and I was brought swiftly back to reality and common sense: to make a good choice, you need time. The question is: how much time? Tracey says that early on in a relationship it is very easy for lust and excitement to be mistaken for love . How long do you need to spend together before you truly know someone well enough to say ‘Yep. You and only you are the person I know I’m going to want beside me from now until I draw my last breath?’ My instincts and statistics tell me the original model that our parent’s generation followed (and lots still do) - of 18 months courtship and marriage a year or so after that - is probably about right. In my eye, that’s long enough to see if you have what it takes to last - which isn’t, by the way, love, but other factors that go with it. Friendship is as important as love. You both need to be as committed to the commitment you’re making, as you are to each other. Communication is critical. So is being able to compromise and work as a team as well maintaining a healthy individualism. Yes, you do just ‘know’ sometimes, when you’re met the right person for you. But isn’t it wiser and less hurtful all round, to wait a little while to check your instincts were correct ? After all, if you truly are convinced you’re going to stay together forever, what’s the rush to prove it?

"This map reveals how Cardiff has become a hotbed for extremism where a string of young Muslims have been inspired to launch jihad in Syria, Iraq and also in the UK. The father of two radicals says the Welsh capital is facing a crisis with extremists leafleting communities and holding 'pop-up' events to groom young men. At least three students brought up in Cardiff have fallen under their spell and fled to fight with other extremists from Isis in the past year. Two appeared in a video encouraging others to join them. But the latest shocking case involving Reyaad Khan, 20, and brothers Nasser Muthana, 20, and 17-year-old Aseel is not the first time the city has had links to jihad. In 2012 Cardiff brothers Gurukanth Desai, and Abdul Miah, were jailed along with Omar Latif, also from the city, for plotting Mumbai-style attacks in Britain. Scroll down for video . Cardiff cases: The Welsh capital has had links in recent years to terror plots and now had three young men fighting for Isis in Syria and Iraq . They had planned a Christmas bombing campaign with targets including the London Stock Exchange, Big Ben and Westminster Abbey. The gang was made up of men from all over the UK, but the majority were from Cardiff. The cell met in the city's Roath Park to discuss the mass murder not realising they were being watched by the security services. In one exchange on November 7 2010 undercover police heard one member mention bombs before saying: ‘If you don’t attack them, they are going to attack you. You know we have got to go for a place that is worldwide remembered.’ Their sister Ruksana Begum, 22, who . has a first-class degree in accountancy, was later jailed because she . had two editions of Al-Qaeda's Inspire magazine on her phone, including . articles such as 'Targeting the populations of countries that are at war . with the Muslims'. Ms Begum, who lived in Cardiff . with her family prior to her marriage, was sentenced to one year in . prison, having pleaded guilty in December 2012 to possessing material . which was likely to be useful to someone committing or preparing an act . of terrorism. Ms Begum, . of north London, appeared with only her eyes visible beneath a black . veil to be sentenced after being remanded in Holloway prison. Brothers: Gurukanth Desai, 30, left and Abdul Malik Miah, 25, were among nine men, the majority from Cardiff who admitted plotting to blow up the London Stock Exchange and other targets during a Christmas bomb blitz . Surveillance: This meeting in Cardiff park led to the convictions of the men  because one mentioned bombs and said: 'If you don't attack them, they are going to attack you. You know we have got to go for a place that is worldwide remembered' This . month Muslim student Khuram Iqbal, 21,  who allegedly posted a series . of links to extremist videos on his Facebook and Twitter pages and . called himself the 'Father of Terrorism' appeared in court. The father of the brothers in Syria, Ahmed Muthana, 57, said extremists are leafleting Muslim communities in the Welsh capital encouraging young men to join the jihad in Syria and Iraq. He also said the recruitment meetings are never held in the same venue twice to avoid being infiltrated by anti-terrorist police. Mr Muthana says one of the meetings was held in the Channel View Leisure Centre in the Grangetown area of Cardiff - after being rented out by the Labour-run council. Father-of-four Mr Muthana said: 'I believe my two sons went to one of these meetings and now they are with the Isis people in Syria. 'They never hold these meetings in the same place twice - they know what they are doing. Cardiff link: Reyaad Khan and Aseel's brother Nasser Muthana appear in this Isis recruitment video encouraging others to fight jihad . Young recruit: 17-year-old Aseel Muthana was allegedly a member of a violent Cardiff gang before he fled to join his brother Nasser fighting for Isis in Syria . School days: Third British jihadist Reyaad Khan having fun with friends in Cardiff before he fled to fight . 'I know they had a meeting at Channel View, there have been others in restaurants and in private homes. 'They just book a room at these places saying it is for a private function. 'It is like one of these pop-up restaurants. They are there for a few hours and then they move on.' Mr Muthana added: 'Some of the venues have been restaurants and businesses run by people sympathetic to the extremists.' He believes the five young men from Cardiff, including his two middle sons Nasser, 20, and Aseel, 17, were recruited this way last year before being flown out to Syria with their travel expenses paid for. Two of the five young men who went out to Syria have since returned - one after his parents flew to the Middle East to bring him home. Mr Muthana said: 'I have two plane tickets waiting for my sons to get them home but I don't think they will ever be used.' The distraught father suffered a heart attack after learning that his son Aseel had joined his brother Nasser to fight in Syria. A leading academic said he was convinced young Muslim men in the Welsh capital are being recruited in face-to-face meetings. Radicalisation expert Dr Suraj Lakhani said: 'The police, government and intelligence services have been concerned about different problems in Cardiff for some time. 'There have also been voices from the local community raising concerns about radicalisations in Cardiff. 'I believe that these boys in the recruitment video would have met face-to-face with the people who have radicalised them.' Mosque: The South Wales Islamic centre in Butetown, Cardiff, one of the places where young Welsh terror recruit Nasser Muthana would go to worship . Dr Lakhani, of Cardiff University, recently completed his doctorate - A Social Analysis of Radicalisation in the UK. He said the three young Cardiff men currently fighting in Syria and the two others who have returned would have been radicalised together. He said: 'It was organised and funded. The youngest boy is only 17 and he flew out on a fake passport. 'His older brother went after borrowing just a hundred pounds from his father.' Dr Lakhani said there were several reasons why young men may be willing to risk their lives abroad. 'It doesn't take very many people to cause a big problem,' he said.","Welsh capital has been linked to string of cases linked to extremist violence .

"A new batch of emails released today by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee show former IRS official Lois Lerner was concerned about Congress being able subpoena her online communications. In an April 9, 2013 email exchange with an IRS technology employee named . Maria Hooke, Lerner asked if the company's interoffice messaging system . was searchable like emails because employees in her division wanted to . know if they needed to be as careful with the conversations over the system as they are with their email conversations. The inquiry came less than two weeks after the Oversight committee says the Inspector General informed the IRS that an audit of the federal agency produced evidence that Lerner's division was targeting conservatives, raising suspicions about the nature of Lerner's question. A new batch of emails from former director of the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) exempt organizations office Lois Lerner show that she was concerned about Congress reading her online communications . Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan takes IRS commissioner John Koskinen to the woodshed during a hearing today over Lois Lerner's emails . The email chain was discovered among approximately 15,000 emails Republican Rep. Jim Jordan . says the IRS 'dumped' on the Oversight committee near the close of . business on the eve of the Fourth of July holiday last week. 'I had a question today about OCS,' Lerner said in the first email, referring to the company's Microsoft Office Communications Server. 'I was cautioning folks about email and how we have had several occasions where Congress has asked for emails and there has been an electronic search for responsive emails--so we need to be cautious about what we say in emails,' she continued. 'Someone asked if OCS conversations were also searchable--I don't know, but told them I would get back to them. 'Do you know?' she asked. In a response email sent later that afternoon Hooke told Lerner instant messages are not 'set to automatically save,' but the 'functionality exists in the software.' Hooke explained that chats would only be searchable if one of the individuals involved saved the conversation as an email or a file. 'My general recommendation is to treat the conversation as if it could/is being save somewhere, as it is possible for either party of the conversation to retain the information and have it turn up as part of the electronic search,' she said. 'Make sense?' Lerner responded six minutes with a single word: 'Perfect.' Also copied on the emails was IRS Director for Exempt Organizations Exam Unit Manager Nanette Downing, an auditor. Koskinen said this was the first time he'd heard about Lerner's email to the technology department . At an Oversight Government Operations subcommittee hearing today that IRS Commissioner John Koskinen was testifying at on another topic, Jordan confronted him about Lerner's email exchange. Jordan said that on June 3, 2011, Ways and Mean Chairman David Camp sent a letter to the IRS expressing concern that the IRS is targeting conservative groups. Ten days later, Jordan said, the computers of several IRS officials, including Lerner, crashed, and many of their emails were lost. Two years later on March 28, 2013, the Inspector General told the IRS 'that you've been caught with your hands in the cookie jar,' Jordan continued. And just 12 days after that, the email exchange between Lerner and Hooke took place, he said. Jordan, the second highest ranking Republican on the Oversight committee, read Lerner's emails aloud and testily asked Koskinen if he knew about them before today. 'No, and I don't see anything in here where Lois Lerner says, ""Well, I got rid of my earlier emails, and now I gotta check on them,"" ' the IRS official, who was not in charge of the agency when the targeting happened, fired back. The subcommittee hearing moved back on track after Jordan ran down his allotted time to question Koskinen, but other Republican Representatives joined in on the discussion via twitter. 'Why was Lois Lerner cautioning #IRS officials to ""be cautious about what we say in emails""if she had nothing to hide?' North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows said.'Ridiculous,' said Kansas Rep. Lynn Jenkins said in a comment in front of a link to a news story about Lerner's latest emails.","The House released more emails today from Lois Lerner, the IRS official at the center of the Tea Party targeting scandal .
In a newly discovered email chain, Lerner asks the IRS' tech team if the agency's interoffice chat records can be subpenaed by Congress .

'I've always wanted to play for the Barbarians - it's one of the brilliant traditions of the game,' Stevens said. 'I am back at Twickenham as well, so there will definitely be a bit of nostalgia for me. It is a fantastic place. 'The last time I played there was in the Aviva Premiership final (on May 31), and it was a nice way to finish even though it was tough to have lost my last game on English soil.'

"The Montana Supreme Court has ordered the reinstatement of charges against a married mother first charged with repeatedly fabricating false rape claims in 2012. Prosecutors believe Christina Nadine Nelson, 23, of Billings made several false rape or assault claims between 2009 and 2012. The charges had been dismissed last July by Judge G. Todd Baugh, but last week the state’s supreme court overruled his decision and ordered a reinstatement of the accusations. Christina Nadine Nelson, 23, of Billings will face trial after the Montana Supreme Court ruled that there was sufficient evidence to prosecute her over repeatedly fabricating false rape claims . The justices ruled that there is sufficient evidence to let a jury decide the case, reports the Billings Gazette. The first accusation against Nelson dates back to 2009, when she said she was raped on her way to prom. Nelson, a foreign exchange student from Germany, was a student at Columbia Falls High School. She claimed her prom date raped her and cut her with a knife, but detectives found inconsistencies with her statements. An investigation found she suffered no cuts on the night of her prom. When detectives asked if there was blood on her prom dress from the cuts, Nelson told them there was blood but she had washed it off. It is unknown if Nelson, a married mother, is in Billings or if she has returned to Germany, where she was born . A month after the prom, Nelson stated she wanted to drop the charges against her date. After her initial rape report, the boy was expelled from school and not allowed to return to campus. 'He moved out of state because he felt that his reputation was destroyed by Christina's allegations,' court documents state. In 2012, Nelson claimed she was raped by her ex-boyfriend. She said he approached her in the parking lot of her workplace and hit her repeatedly before forcing her into the back of his van and raping her. Nelson said after the assault, she went to a bar to have a drink with a friend, before going to the gym with her husband. After having intercourse with her husband later that night, Nelson told him about the rape. He took her to Billings Clinic for an exam. But when detectives reviewed parking lot surveillance footage from that night, they found no evidence to substantiate her claims. Nelson, a foreign exchange student from Germany, was a student at Columbia Falls High School in Billings . Video showed Nelson walking from her workplace to her car and driving away. Detectives also learned that her ex-boyfriend was out of town on the night she claimed he raped her. Between 2009 and 2012 a total of five medical rape exams were conducted on Nelson and she made two reports of assault. 'Christina had a motive or pattern of accusing young men that she had dated of raping her and assaulting her when no such rape or assault had occurred,' prosecutors state in court documents. It is unknown if Nelson is in Billings or if she has returned to Germany, where she was born. After Baugh dismissed the case, Nelson was allowed to travel out of the country.","Prosecutors believe Christina Nadine Nelson, 23, of Billings, Montana, made several false rape or assault claims between 2009 and 2012 .

"England are much improved under the stewardship of Stuart Lancaster, but I can’t help feeling Wednesday’s announcement can only damage our chances for next year’s World Cup. Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt have developed into a settled and effective coaching team and have established a working environment that has produced results and shown great promise. Starting with four great Test matches next month, we are in for a hugely exciting year, culminating in a home World Cup with these men rightfully at the helm. I believe they will all remain within the England set-up for some time. Indeed, I have always felt Lancaster would eventually move up to a director of rugby position, with Farrell taking the helm as head coach. I can also see the business sense from the RFU’s perspective - the announcement implies belief, stability and consistency in the set-up. Stuart Lancaster will coach England beyond the World Cup in 2019 after being handed a contract extension . The RFU also handed contract extensions to England coaches Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt . VIDEO England coaches extend contracts to 2020 . But nobody was crying out for the coaching team to change, no-one was concerned they would be snapped up by other nations. So why make such a public announcement? Is the RFU going public good for England’s World Cup hopes? No. It is a distraction that could diminish the team’s hunger and fear factor. All of England’s coaches are thoroughly professional and those who know them best will testify that their determination and drive will be a safeguard against complacency. But I am talking about the potential for the smallest of subconscious slips - and equally importantly, the smallest of fillips for the opposition. Coaching in elite sport is not about job security, it is about knowing that if you lose the next few games, you’re history. I wouldn’t want my players thinking about the coach being around for years to come while their position is forever on the line. I’d rather they thought: ‘This guy’s job is on the line, so I’ll put my body on the line for him.’ England coaches (from left to right) Rowntree, Catt, Lancaster and Farrell extend their deals until 2019 . The extensions are deserved but can only do harm rather than good to England's 2015 World Cup challenge . On the opposite side of the coin, if I was in the New Zealand or Australian camps I’d be thinking: ‘So they think they’ve cracked it? I’m hungrier than the bloke in the tracksuit up in the stand. I’ve got more to play for.’ It is a problem of perception that could have been avoided. Throughout my time as England coach, one of my mantras was that everyone’s noses must be pointed in the same direction. Right now, every nose in the England set-up should be pointed at a home World Cup. Every sinew and brain cell should be focused on next year: the 2015 World Cup will set the tone for the development of rugby in this country for a long time. We must get every detail right. My 2003 England team agreed that there would be no distracting announcements as we went into the World Cup. It was clear that some of the senior players would be retiring, but nothing was said as it would have created a sideshow. Similarly, I signed a contract extension as we were getting ready to fly to Australia. Again, nothing was announced. That time had to be about England, not about individuals. England won the World Cup in 2003 and the player did not announce their expected retirements before it . Sir Clive Woodward signed an extension before the 2003 World Cup but did not announce it to the public . Lancaster has done a terrific job, picking up England from a low point after the last World Cup. I don’t want anything to damage that progress at such a crucial point in the international cycle. The closer you get to a World Cup, the tougher it gets for an international coach. Every year gets harder. All the big national sides renew their focus, they turn the intensity of their game up a notch or two. On Wednesday we learned that the England coaching team will also prepare the team for the 2019 World Cup. We didn’t need to know that. No-one should be thinking that far ahead. Let’s deal with 2015 first! The real test of how far England have progressed comes next year, in brutal World Cup pool clashes against Australia and Wales. Steffon Armitage (left) and Danny Cipriani (right) could lose motivation over their England chances . Wales (left) and Australia (right) are in England's World Cup pool and could be motivated by the annoucement . Awarding these contracts could also undermine ambition. It could erode the ambition of other Premiership coaches who think they should have a crack at coaching England. It could also kill the ambition of players who are outside the England set-up. Lancaster’s team will think the news is great, that their man is now secure in the job for years to come. But what about the Ciprianis and the Armitages? No matter how much Lancaster says he is keeping the door open, they will fear international rugby has passed them by. There’s an interesting debate to be had as to whether an international coach has a natural shelf-life, a time after which new ideas are needed. We certainly haven’t reached that stage. Lancaster and his fellow coaches have already proved enough to deserve an extended run in the job. But I fear their new deals could hang over them like a dark and menacing cloud, that their contracts will become the story. World champions New Zealand could take extra motivation, believing England have become complacent . Newcastle United manager Alan Pardew suffered after being awarded an eight-year contract by Mike Ashley . Newcastle United’s Alan Pardew, who was awarded an eight-year contract by Mike Ashley, is feeling the weight of this decision now. If England lose two of the autumn internationals, if they fail to win the 2015 Six Nations, will the length of Lancaster’s contract become a similar weight? What if England don’t get out of what is a really tough World Cup group? I hope I am wrong about the RFU’s hasty announcement. I want nothing more than for Lancaster’s England to win the World Cup next year. Then we can debate whether he should keep going until 2019 or to move upstairs and let Farrell take over. But I fear Wednesday may have weakened England, even by the tiniest amount. International rugby is not a cosy environment. To get to the very top, a team needs to have an edge about them. England need an amazing intensity and a real fear factor for the next 12 months. They don’t need to be thinking about Japan in 2019. Andy Farrell (second right) could be the next England head coach in waiting after impressing so far .","England have improved massively under Stuart Lancaster's stewardship .

"A poignant account of the German general Erwin Rommel being led away to his death told by his teenage son has been discovered. In a revealing letter written by Manfred Rommel, he tells of his father's last moments after he was ordered to commit suicide by Adolf Hitler. His father explained to him he had to poison himself after being implicated in a plot to assassinate the Nazi dictator. Desert Fox: German general Erwin Rommel agreed to commit suicide in return for assurances his family would be spared . The 15-year-old described watching . Rommel, known as the 'Desert Fox', being led into a staff car by two . German generals minutes later. Manfred's account then details how his . mother took a phone call from a local hospital just 15 minutes later to . inform her her husband had died. Field marshal Rommel died within five . seconds of biting on a cyanide capsule while sat in the back of the car . as it drove away from his home to the hospital. Manfred's typed-written account was made . on April 27, 1945, when the Allies had all but won the war in Europe, . and is believed to have been dictated by him as it is in English. A poignant account describing the moment Erwin Rommel was led away to his death, written by his teenage son Manfred, has been found. Erwin Rommel, also known as Desert Fox, was regarded as one of the most skilled commanders of desert warfare in World War Two . The two-page document has come to light after it sold at auction as part of an archive of other wartime mementoes. Poignant testimony: Manfred Rommel (pictured) went on to become a lawyer, politician and mayor of Stuttgart where he lives today . The collection once belonged to Captain . Noel Chavasse, who the adjutant officer to British army chief Sir . Bernard Montgomery in the Second World War. It is believed Montgomery had requested a . copy of the account as, despite being enemies, he and Rommel had a . great respect for one another. Mr Chavasse's daughter has sold her father's archive of documents and photographs for 10,500 pounds. Rommel was forced into the 'honourable' suicide in October 1944 to spare his family suffering. He was accused of plotting against Hitler . and given the choice of suicide or a court trial which would have led . to his conviction and execution and pain for his family. He said: 'At 12 o'clock my father . received the two generals. About three quarters of an hour after that I . met my father just coming out of my mother's room . 'He . then told me... that Adolf Hitler had given him the choice between . taking poison or being brought before the People's Court. 'Adolf Hitler had also let him know that in the event of his committing suicide, nothing was to happen to his family. 'Having . said farewell to me... my father left the house in uniform, we . accompanying (sic) him to the car where the general saluted him with . Heil Hitler. 'My father got into the car first and took a seat in the back followed by the generals... the car drove off.

German people so was offering him the chance of a voluntary death by . means of a poison pill. 'It would have a mortal effect within 5 seconds. In the event of his refusing, he was to be arrested immediately.' Manfred Rommel had planned on joining Hitler's notorious Waffen SS but his father was against it and so joined the Luftwaffe. He went on to become a lawyer, politician and mayor of Stuttgart, where he lives today. Word of a son: Manfred Rommel gave the account of his father's death in his teens . In his words: The testimony is believed to have been dictated by Manfred in English as it is written down . Bernard Pass, of Bosley's auctioneers of Marlow, Bucks, which sold the account, said: 'Rommel's son must have gone to the Allies and given this true account of what happened to his father rather than the one that had been issued by the Nazi propaganda machine. 'Rommel was a national hero and as popular as Hitler in Germany. 'The suggestion of Rommel turning traitor against Hitler would have had a very damaging effect on the Nazi party had it come out at a trial. 'This is a very poignant account as told by a son seeing his father led away to his death.' Erwin Rommel, who was also known as Desert Fox, was one of Germany’s most respected military leaders in World War Two. He played a part in two very significant battles during the war – at El Alamein in North Africa and at D-Day. It was his leadership of German and Italian forces in the North African campaign that established the legend of the Desert Fox, a name given to him by the British. Rommel is regarded as having been a humane and professional officer. His Afrikakorps was never accused of war crimes. He also ignored orders to kill captured commandos, Jewish soldiers and civilians in all theaters of his command, according to reports. Coming to the end of World War Two, Rommel was accused of conspiring to kill Adolf Hitler (pictured). Hitler was keen to avoid the public show trial of his most famous general and it seems that a 'deal’ was done in order to eliminate Rommel quietly. Rommel died ‘of his wounds’ on October 14, 1944. He was given a state funeral. But it was later revealed he committed suicide. He agreed to kill himself by taking a cyanide pill, in return for assurances his family would not be punished.","German general Erwin Rommel told his teenage son he had been ordered to kill himself by Adolf Hitler .

"House Oversight and Government Reform Committee chair Rep. Darrell Issa sent his latest subpoena to the Obama administration on Friday, demanding testimony from the director of a controversial White House office reportedly tasked with political work on taxpayers' dime. David Simas, the director of the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, has refused to testify voluntarily but will be required to answer questions in a July 16 hearing on Capitol Hill. President Barack Obama closed the White House Office of Political Affairs in 2011, just days before an Office of Special Counsel report warned that it risked 'transforming from an official government office into a partisan political operation.' But the president reopened the office six months ago under a new name as Democrats began to gear up for a contentious midterm election fight. The New York Times reported then that the White House was 'serious about defending Democratic control of the Senate and taking back the House from Republicans.' David Simas (with Barack Obama), the director of the White House Office of Political Strategy and Outreach, has been subpoenaed to testify before Congress about the kinds of political work his office carries out with taxpayer funds . House . Oversight chairman Darrell Issa, a California Republican, has . subpoenaed Simas to learn whether his White House office is a persistent . Hatch Act violator . 'White House officials,' according to the Times, 'said it makes more sense to have a political office during a congressional election year to focus attention on candidate needs, including fund-raising.' Issa, a hard-charging California Republican who has pressed the administration on alleged IRS abuses, said Friday that the White House's reboot of its Office of Political Affairs was an 'effort to appease its political allies' by 'assist[ing] in partisan election efforts and fundraising.' Former Secretary of Labor Hilda Solis and former Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius Issa said, 'were faulted by the Office of Special Counsel for inappropriately using their offices in violation of the Hatch Act. That federal law prohibits most executive branch employees from engaging in political activity while on duty, or at any time in their workplaces. It also prohibits them from soliciting or receiving political contributions, according to the U.S. Office of Government Ethics. In 2012 Sebelius slipped a political message into a speech to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay advocacy group. The Office of Special Counsel later accused her of violating the Hatch Act. She later said she had made a 'technical' error, and pledged not to repeat it. The initial move to shutter the White House's political office was spearheaded by California Rep. Henry Waxman in 2007, when Democrats controlled the House of Representatives and Waxman chaired the committee now run by Issa. At the time it was seen as a partisan move to prohibit the George W. Bush White House from using the president's bully pulpit to affect the 2008 presidential election. Chastened: Then-Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius inserted political electioneering rhetoric into a 2012 speech, and was forced to meet with ethics lawyers when Hatch Act concerns were raised . Waxman's staffers interviewed 20 political appointees and pored over nearly 70,000 documents. They issued a report one month before Obama defeated Republican Mitt Romney, declaring that 'American taxpayers should not pay the salaries of White House officials when they are engaged in helping members of the president’s political party.' The Obama White House did not respond to a request for comment. But newly minted White House Counsel W. Neil Eggleston wrote to Issa in June to insist that the new incarnation of the political office operates without violating the Hatch Act. Special Counsel Carolyn Lerner, however, wrote in March that the Obama administration reopened the office without consulting ith her to determine if it was legal. Lerner will testify in the June 16 hearing, along with Simas and Scott Coffina, a former Associate Counsel to the President during the Bush Administration. In March, Issa asked the White House to provide copies of all its documents related to the 2014 reopening. To date, it has provided none.","Obama administration shuttered its Office of Political Affairs in 2011 over ethics charges first leveled by Democrats during the George W. Bush era .

Speaking after Italy's 2-1 win over England in Manaus, the Roma star compared Gerrard to Andrea Pirlo, Xavi and Andres Iniesta, as well as England team-mate Frank Lampard.

'Players like Gerrard, Andrea Pirlo, Frank Lampard, Xavi or Iniesta never go past the apex of their careers.' De Rossi was less kind about Mario Balotelli, who scored the goal which beat England in Brazil on Saturday night. 'Balotelli is a player with great quality and his goal was scored with the movement of a real hitman.

"Alan Pardew is on the brink of the sack as Newcastle boss after they were crushed 4-0 by Southampton. His four-year tenure in charge is becoming untenable after he was the target of repeated taunts from his own fans throughout their mauling.

Newcastle United fans also held a banner saying 'Pardew is a muppet' during the 4-0 defeat at St Mary's . Defeat by Hull, who they host next Saturday, could spell the end for Pardew. After their opening four league games they are yet to win, having conceded nine and scored just four. Repeated chants of ‘We want Pardew out’ and ‘Alan Pardew, it’s never your fault’ started when they conceded after just six minutes and punctuated the whole match. Pardew said: ‘They are fair because you can’t get beat 4-0 as Newcastle manager. It is tough to take and not that easy to digest and not easy for the players either to play under those circumstances. ‘We have to be strong and try and tough it out this week and come back next week.

"Irina Shayk is now officially back on the market according to her agent. Reported in the New York Post, Shayk's representative commented on the break up: 'We can confirm that Irina Shayk has ended her relationship with Cristiano Ronaldo.' It is not yet clear what caused the split, with rumours circulating of a rocky relationship between the Russian model and Ronaldo's mother. Ronaldo and Shayk reportedly split because the Russian model refused to attend his mother's birthday . Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo (second right) trained with his team mates on Saturday . The agent added: 'She has been very close to his family throughout their relationship. Any negative rumors about Irina and Ronaldo's family are completely false and have not been a factor in the cause of the split. Irina has no comments at the moment.' Shayk refused to attend the 60th birthday party of the Ballon d'Or winner's mother according to a newspaper in Portugal. Family man: Cristiano was accompanied by his mother, Maria Dolores dos Santos Aveiro on stage . Coreio de Manhana reported that Shayk had told Ronaldo that she would not be attending the bash in his native Madeira, and the ensuing row served to end the pair's five-year romance. As a parting dig to Ronaldo, the Russian model has now stopped following him on Twitter. A source told Coreio de Manhana: 'Cristiano wanted to surprise his mum and as he spent Christmas with Irina in Dubai, he had planned to be with his mum on her birthday, but Irina didn't want to go. 'They had such a big row that he ended up spending New Years Eve alone with his son. 'Irina mouthed off about Dolores and Ronaldo took sides with him mum. It was the straw that broke the camel's back because they had hadn't been getting on well in the last few months.' Ronaldo takes part in a training session ahead of Real Madrid's game with Getafe on January 18 . Real Madrid are currently top of La Liga with 42 points, one more than second placed Barcelona . Ronaldo has won the Ballon d'Or for the third time in his career and for the second consecutive year . The newspaper also claimed Irina decided to stay in a hotel during one of her recent trips to Madrid because Dolores, who watched proudly as her son won his third Ballon d'Or on Monday, was at Cristiano's luxury home on the exclusive estate La Finca. 'Dolores thinks Irina wasn't the right woman for Ronaldo's son,' the source continued. 'She wanted someone who would, in the future, assume the role of mum for Cristiano Jr. That wasn't a priority for Irina.' Along with Dolores, Cristiano is raising four-year-old son Cristiano Jr, whose mother's identity has been fiercely guarded by the sportsman. Cristiano's mother, Dolores, didn't believe that Irina was a suitable mother figure for her grandson . Irina's dramatic Twitter unfollow came after she failed to support Ronaldo in Zurich on Monday when he was awarded the prestigious FIFA Ballon d'Or award. Cristiano also noticeably failed to mention Irina's name during his acceptance speech. 'It's an unforgettable moment in my life to win the Ballon d'Or for the third time,' Ronaldo said after claiming football's most prestigious individual award for the second consecutive year. 'I feel extremely happy and proud to receive this award and I want to keep challenging myself every day. 'I have to thank my family, all the people who support me and also my colleagues of Real Madrid and Portuguese National team that make me a better player every day.' Irina was by Ronaldo's side when he collected the prestigious Ballon d'Or award in 2013 . According to Irina's PR representative, the model did not attend the annual FIFA Ballon d'Or awards because she simply had other commitments. '[The Ballon d'Or] didn't fit in with her schedule,' a spokesperson told Goal.com. 'It was because of work commitments. We have no further comment to make.' However, some have raised doubts over the explanation as the awards ceremony had been in the calendar for 12 months in advance. Suspicious fans have also questioned why Irina did not bother to congratulate her estranged boyfriend on any of her social networking accounts either. Irina has been posting pictures of a recent winter getaway on Twitter without Ronaldo . Irina has posted plenty of bikini shots on her Instagram and Facebook pages over the past few days . Rather than congratulating him on his impressive achievement, she instead chose to post pictures of herself on a winter getaway to a mysterious location, where she celebrated her 29th birthday. Judging by the solo photographs, Cristiano was not there to celebrate Irina's big day with her. MailOnline has contacted representatives for Irina Shayk and Cristiano Ronaldo for comment.

"A family Ohio were in for a nasty surprised after they returned from a visit out-of-town visit to a dying relative to find someone else had moved into their house. Their outrage has now turned into a court battle, pitting them against a man who says he has the court documents to prove the house is now his. Robert Carr moved into the home that had been occupied for 21 years, changed the locks and emptied the house. Scroll down for video... Robert Carr: He filed 'quiet titles' on these properties, saying he has a right to claim them because the families who previously occupied the homes have forfeited their rights of ownership because they abandoned the property . Under new owners: This is just one of the $130,000 homes that Robert Carr has possessed under his 'sovereign' rights and used a 'quiet title' When the family confronted Carr, he showed them a document he filed with the the County Court. It's called a 'quiet title' and lays claim to the property because Carr says the family abandoned the house and gave up all their rights. The family members have said they are too afraid to be identified. 'What he's looking for is full title and ownership of the home,' the family's attorney, Alison Warner, said. Wreckless: The former family who used to live in this home say their lives have been turned upside down by Carrs' actions . Carr expects to pay nothing to keep the home. 'He's in their home. They don't know when he's there. He can be there now,' Warner said. WLWT has uncovered 11 other instances where Carr has filed the same paperwork. Seven of the cases were filed on the same day. 'When you abandon a property and don't want anything to do with it, somebody can come in and take it,'' Carr WLWT. 'I have a team of people who go out and I say make sure the house is empty. If it's empty, change the locks,' Carr said. 'Anybody can do it.' The family from Springfield who don't want to be identified say they feel violated. 'I'm very scared, you know, because I never know if somebody's going to be here,' the homeowner said. Their attorney told Johnson the legal fight is adding to a painful year for the family. Making sense in his world: Robert Carr went into the home , changed the locks and emptied the house. The family said when they confronted Carr, he showed them a document he filed with the Hamilton County Court . Court documents: Carr has filed for ownership of 11 'abandoned' homes in the area. Seven were applied for in court on the same day . They could be dismissed as a nuisance, a loose network of individuals living in the United States who call themselves “sovereign citizens” and believe that federal, state, and local governments operate illegally. Some of their actions, although quirky, are not crimes. The offenses they do commit seem minor, like creating false license plates, driver’s licenses, and even currency.However, a closer look at sovereign citizens’ more severe crimes, from financial scams to impersonating or threatening law enforcement officials, gives reason for concern. If someone challenges (e.g., a standard traffic stop for false license plates) their ideology, the behavior of these sovereign-citizen extremists quickly can escalate to violence. Since 2000, lone-offender sovereign-citizen extremists have killed six law enforcement officers. In 2010, two Arkansas police officers stopped sovereign-citizen extremists Jerry Kane and his 16-year-old son Joseph during a routine traffic stop on Interstate 40. Joseph Kane jumped out of the vehicle and opened fire with an AK-47 assault rifle, killing both officers.The sovereign-citizen threat likely will grow as the nationwide movement is fueled by the Internet, the economic downturn, and seminars held across the country that spread their ideology and show people how they can tap into funds and eliminate debt through fraudulent methods. As sovereign citizens’ numbers grow, so do the chances of contact with law enforcement and, thus, the risks that incidents will end in violence. Law enforcement and judicial officials must understand the sovereign-citizen movement, be able to identify indicators, and know how to protect themselves from the group’s threatening tactics. Carr has been charged with breaking and entering in one case of disputed ownership but he is even fighting that charge. Quiet title actions are used to determine who legally holds the title to property, because real estate may sometimes change hands frequently, and the lawsuits can help remove clouds over claims of ownership. The suits are also used by so-called sovereign citizens, who believe they alone get to decide which laws to obey – particularly tax and property laws — based on what they determine to be the founding fathers’ intent. The antigovernment movement has grown in recent years and is rooted in the anti-Semitic, anti-black and anti-tax Posse Comitatus movement of the 1970s and 1980s. Most recent recruits to the sovereign citizens movement found themselves in desperate situations, often due to the economy or foreclosure, and are drawn to the idea of easy money or living free of legal consequences. Sovereign citizens are becoming well-known by the courts for filing astronomical liens against banks, attorneys and government employees. While these are usually unsuccessful, they can be expensive to fight and take a long time to resolve. The FBI has been informed about the case but won't comment on the specifics. 'They'll come together as groups to receive training, how to conduct some of these schemes from a financial standpoint, to understand what they consider the common law and how they can use that common law for their sovereign purposes,' The family in Springdale called the court fight a nightmare. 'It's really been hard,' the homeowner said.","Robert Carr defies authorities and seizes ‘abandoned’ Ohio homes .

Manchester Police have released images of two of the men wanted over the violent attack, which has chilling echoes of the murder of student Sophie Lancaster, who was killed for being a Goth in 2008. Attacked: Melody McDermott suffered a fractured eye socket when yobs stamped on her face because of the way she looks . Wanted: Police want to speak to these two men in relation to the brutal attack . Police said the group started shouting abuse at Melody and a male friend before following them onto a tram at 6.40pm on October 5. Melody was headbutted, pushed to the ground and her face was stamped on while her 29-year-old friend was left with a black eye after also being punched and kicked to the ground. Melody was injured in a 'completely unprovoked and violent attack', said police . Sylvia Lancaster, whose Goth daughter Sophie was beaten to death ten miles away four years ago, condemned the attackers. She told The Sun: 'Like her they were targeted for how they looked.' A police spokesman told the MailOnline the attack on Melody and her friend was motivated by the victims' appearance. Detective . Constable Simon Swann from Bury CID said: 'This was a completely . unprovoked and violent attack on two people who were returning home from . an evening out. 'They have been left with serious injuries that have left them both in a lot of pain.' In 2008 the nation was appalled after Goth student Sophie Lancaster was  beaten to death by two teenagers. Brendan . Harris attacked Sophie, 20, when she begged him and four . other drunken youths to stop beating her boyfriend, Robert Maltby. Senseless: Sylvia Lancaster has been campaigning for greater awareness after the needless death of her daughter Sophie in 2008 . Her boyfriend survived the beating but Sophie died in hospital two weeks later. At the trial into her death the court heard Harris, 15 and accomplice Ryan Herbert, 16, were so violent in their attack that when paramedics arrived at the scene in Bacup they couldn't tell if Sophie was male or female. Anyone with information should phone police on 0161 856 8163 or the independent charity Crimestoppers, anonymously, on 0800 555 111.","She has fractured eye socket after unprovoked attack .

"Rio Ferdinand has hailed his former Manchester United team-mate Cristiano Ronaldo ahead of Monday's Ballon d'Or ceremony - lauding the Real Madrid forward as the 'best player on the planet'. Queens Park Rangers defender Ferdinand selected Ronaldo in his EA Sports FIFA Team of the Year for 2015 - alongside the Portgueuse forward's Real team-mate Gareth Bale and arch-rival Lionel Messi in a potentially-lethal front three. Ronaldo will go up against Barcelona's Messi and Bayern Munich's Manuel Neuer - who gets the goalkeeping spot in Ferdinand's side - for the Ballon d'Or on Monday, with the Portuguese forward a heavy favourite to claim his second successive award, and the third of his career. Cristiano Ronaldo is the 'best player on the planet' and should win the Ballon d'Or, says Rio Ferdinand . Ferdinand's EA Sports FIFA Team of the Year included Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Gareth Bale up front . Ferdinand also selected Manchester United's Angel di Maria and Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin . Lionel Messi (right) also features in Ferdinand's team of the year and is one of the Ballon d'Or contenders . Messi (left) and Ronaldo will go up against one another for the Ballon d'Or on Monday night . And former United centre back Ferdinand believes Ronaldo fully deserves the accolade after enjoying a 2014 which 'set him apart' from Messi. Ferdinand - who recently joined an EA Sports FIFA 15 panel to debate his Team of the Year alongside QPR team-mate Joey Barton, AFC Wimbledon striker Adebayo Akinfenwa and Tottenham Hotspur right back Kyle Walker - said of Ronaldo: 'He’s the best player on the planet. 'Him or Messi (should win the Ballon d'Or), as they are the best players in the world. Messi was fantastic last year but Ronaldo I think nicked it; he played particularly well scoring lots of goals last year as well. 'He scored more than Messi last year I think, and he won the Champions League and that sets him apart. '(Messi is just) Just a magician, a genius. Someone of his height and physical capability, he shouldn’t be doing what he’s doing but he’s breaking all the records. 'You need a couple of you (to defend against him)! But even then, he finds a way. 'The other day he scored a goal, he nutmegged someone and just passed it into the back of the net and that’s the difference between him and Ronaldo. Ronaldo is more pace and power, both feet, scores every type of goal, whereas Messi passes the ball into the net and Ronaldo more forces the ball into the back of the net a lot of the time.' Ferdinand smiles as he sits around the EA Sports Round Table debating his team of the year . Ferdinand (right) and Ronaldo lift the Premier League trophy in 2007 during their time at Manchester United . Ronaldo (right) celebrates with Alvaro Morata after scoring in the 2014 Champions League final . Ronaldo arrived at Old Trafford in 2003 and played with Ferdinand for six years before departing for the Bernabeu in 2009. As soon as Ronaldo arrived in the North West, Ferdinand explains that he knew the now 29-year-old would go on to dominate world football one day. He continued: 'You could see from the moment that he came in the door at Man United that he was going to be a top player, how far he was going to go you never knew, but for me that’s what I appreciate more about him than anything is that he has made himself a top player in the world. Real Madrid forward Ronaldo (left) holds off the challenge of Atletico Madrid's Mario Suarez . (From left) Adebayo Akinfenwa, Ferdinand, Kyle Walker and Joey Barton debate their teams of the year . 'He could have been a great player, but he’s gone on to be the best player in the world, and right now he is that. That is through sheer desire and determination and through ability. 'And on the right (of my team), is Gareth Bale who potentially could take over these two (Ronaldo and Messi as the best player in the world), as he started younger, he’s fresher. He could be the one who comes on and takes that mantle of being the best player in the world.' Interestingly, Ferdinand places Paul Scholes alongside Ronaldo as the best players he has ever played alongside. 'Scholes is the most natural footballer I have played with in that he could finish football; he actually retired and then came back and was still the best player in training after eight months or whatever it was that he didn’t play.' Gareth Bale makes Ferdinand's side and could take the 'mantle of being the best player in the world' Paul Scholes, pictured in April 2008, is the best player Ferdinand has played with, alongside Ronaldo . In terms of Ferdinand's team of the year itself, his side is anchored by Neuer in goal and would play in a 4-3-3 formation. Speaking about German World Cup winner Neuer, who is looking to become the first goalkeeper to win the Ballon d'Or, the 36-year-old said: 'I think he is the best keeper on the planet and he’s not a traditional goalkeeper just staying on his line, he comes out and cleans up behind the back line.' Protecting Neuer's goal is a back four of Germany World Cup-winning captain Phillip Lahm at right back, Bayern Munich's David Alaba at left back, plus Diego Godin from Atletico Madrid and Real's Raphael Varane, who Ferdinand labels as 'potentially the best centre half in the world' because he is 'quick, strong, (has) anticipation, calm, (is) decent on the ball and won the Champions League'. Ferdinand's midfield would be made up of Bayern midfielder Xabi Alonso, Real's Toni Kroos and Man United winger Angel di Maria. Manuel Neuer is also up for the Ballon d'Or and makes Ferdinand's side as the goalkeeper . When explaining his midfield picks, Ferdinand added: 'Three man midfield. At the base is Xabi Alonso to dictate the pace of the game. Great technician, great passer and great tactical awareness. 'Toni Kroos is another great passer of the ball, pops up with a goal here and there as well and I think that he is a fantastic player that is going to go on and probably dominate midfields for a long time. World Cup winner as well so he had to be in there. 'Left side of the three is Angel di Maria. Last year at Real Madrid he was arguably their best player. He’s great at getting the ball at one end of the pitch and dragging the team up to the other end of the pitch and causing havoc. 'You don’t get many midfielders who can turn defence into attack the way that he does on the ball, committing players.' Angel di Maria (right), pictured against Southampton's Jose Fonte, features in Ferdinand's midfield .

"The live-in lover of French President Francois Hollande today infuriated the mother of his four children by backing her electoral rival for a place in Parliament. Valerie Trierweiler, 47, has never made any secret of her dislike for Segolene Royal, the 58-year-old who shared Mr Hollande's life for more than 30 years. Ms Royal was, in turn, devastated when Mr Hollande left her for Ms Trierweiler, a Paris Match magazine journalist, in 2007. Battling back: Segolene Royal (left) has been left infuriated by Valerie Trierweiler (right), France's new First Lady, because the latter is backing her rival in an election . Now Ms Royal, herself a former Socialist government minister who stood for the presidency in 2007, is standing for a place in the National Assembly. Ms Royal gained 32 per cent of the vote in the first round of parliamentary elections on Sunday in the western constituency of La Rochelle, and hopes to win outright in the second round on Sunday. But Olivier Falorni, a . popular local Socialist politician in La Rochelle, is standing against . her and achieved 29 per cent of the vote last Sunday. Everybody . expected Mr Hollande to back Ms Royal, but today Ms Trierweiler sparked . outrage by using her Twitter account to post a message of support for . Mr Falorni. Politics: French President Francois Hollande's (left) partner Ms Trierweiler took to Twitter to announce her support for socialist Olivier Falorni (right) It reads: 'Good luck to Olivier Falorni who was not unworthy, who fights alongside the people of La Rochelle for so many years with selfless commitment.' Such a message, from the serving first lady of France, could easily swing the election against Ms Royal and effectively end her political career. 'It's a devastating blow for Segolene, and she's infuriated by what has happened,' said a Socialist Party insider. 'The party has been plagued by in-fighting for many years, but Segelone never expected the President's new lover to make such a provocative gesture.' Telling off: Following Valerie Trierweiler's (pictured right) Twitter comments, Prime minister Jean-Marc Ayrault said 'everyone should know their place' Asked by AFP, France's national news agency, if she was indeed supporting Mr Falorni, Ms Trierweiler simply sent them a text reading: 'Yes'. A senior Elysee Palace presidential aide meanwhile told Le Monde newspaper: 'I am completely blown away. I expected a government crisis, not a domestic one. It's amazing.' Ms Trierweiler has been nicknamed the 'Rottweiler' by conservative politicians, and refuses to give up her job writing for one of France's most sensationalist glossies. Ms Royal had no initial comment, but critics said it was another example of Ms Trierweiler abusing her new position at the heart of the French Republic to make mischief. One of many angry messages which Ms Trierweiler received back on Twitter was from Royal supporter Serge Pastor and reads: 'I did not think that female jealousy went that far.' Ms Royal, who started going out with Mr Hollande when they were still students, stood against him for the Socialist presidential candidacy last year. Her career has been going rapidly downhill since then, but she was hopeful that a parliamentary seat would help revive it.

"Ukraine accused Russia of invasion today, after Vladimir Putin ordered a controversial aid convoy into the country because he could 'wait no longer'. The Russian President held telephone talks with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and, according to the Kremlin, expressed 'serious concern' about the military escalation in eastern Ukraine and admitted he had lost patience in the stand-off over the convoy. Hundreds of lorries that Russia claims are carrying humanitarian aid but which Ukraine insists have a military purpose were sent over the border this morning without permission from the Kiev government, which added that its border guards had been 'blocked'. Scroll down for video . Leading the way: An official opens the gate at the border to let the first lorry across into Ukraine . Convoy: The first batch of trucks make their way towards the Ukrainian border this morning . Tensions in the six-month crisis rose to dangerous levels, as senior Ukrainian officials warned that an attack on the fleet of white trucks could be staged by pro-Russian militants to give a pretext for a full-scale Kremlin occupation of eastern regions of the country. Such a development would trigger a full-scale war on the European Union's doorstep. Nato last night issued a savage rebuke of the Russian  move. 'It can only deepen the crisis in the region, which Russia itself has created and has continued to fuel,' warned chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen. He suspected the convoy was not to help hungry people hit by the civil war but 'to resupply armed separatists'. Sending in Moscow's trucks was a 'blatant breach' of Russia's international commitments and a 'further violation of Ukraine's sovereignty', he said. Partisan locals: The trucks arrive at the Russian side of the border this morning . No entry: But Ukrainian border guards were allegedly 'blocked' from intervening by Russian officials . Warm welcome: Locals in rebel-held eastern Ukraine applaud the first of the lorries in the convoy . The Kremlin was guilty of 'a major escalation in Russian military involvement in eastern Ukraine since mid-August', including the use of Vladimir Putin's forces. Mr Putin said 'further delays would have been unacceptable' in sending the convoy due to the humanitarian catastrophe in the conflict zone. Last night the first the trucks had reached the war-ravaged region of Lugansk, greeted by posters reading: 'Mother Russia will not desert us in hard times.' The Ukrainian secret service, SBU, alleged the convoy has a military purpose, while the Red Cross refused to accompany the lorries as had been planned, after it failed to receive security guarantees from the warring factions. 'This is a direct invasion,' claimed SBU chief Valentyn Nalyvaychenko, as rebel militias escorted the trucks. The Ukrainian foreign ministry denounced a 'deliberate and aggressive' move from Moscow in 'flagrant violation' of international law. 'The fact that Russia's trucks entered Ukrainian territory without proper border and custom formalisation and that the cargo was not handed over to representatives of the International Committee of the Red Cross bespeaks the premeditated and aggressive nature of the Russian party's actions,' it said a statement. 'We call upon all international partners to unite in decisively condemning Russia's illegal and aggressive actions.' Suspicions: Kiev warned that the lorries' drivers would be used to drive military vehicles once inside Ukraine . Shadow of war: Moscow said it had decided to act after growing tired of the 'open-faced lies' about the convoy . White lines: Border guard sources said 145 of the trucks massed on the border had crossed into Ukraine . Inspections: Red Cross officials said they would not be escorting the convoy due to a lack of safety guarantees . Green light: Vladimir Putin told German Chancellor Angela Merkel he could 'wait no longer' to send in the convoy . Ukraine's prime minister Arseniy Yatsenyuk said there was a dire risk that 'several of the trucks of this so-called convoy will be bombed' by pro-Russians but it would be staged to blame Ukraine. A Kiev security official said that Moscow was 'exclusively responsible' for the security of the convoy as it travels across rebel-held territory. Mr Nalyvaychenko warned that the drivers of the convoy would be redeployed to drive military vehicles already smuggled into Ukraine, and the 'aid' would benefit rebel fighters. 'In reality, a group of drivers enters to drive military vehicles which are illegally brought into our country every day via Izvaryne border check post and other checkpoints,' he said. 'There are individuals from prison escort and other units of the Russian Federation among the so-called drivers - for the purpose of kidnapping and covering up crimes. Queue: A family heads past some of the convoy as it waits on the Russian side of the border this morning . Waiting game: Drivers of some of the trucks take a break in the sun as they await instruction in a nearby field . Under scrutiny: Some of the trucks are inspected at the border. Although Ukrainian customs officials searched 34 vehicles, they still did not have security clearance to enter the country . 'These lorries will be used to transport equipment and weapons. Terrorists catastrophically lack them after the successful action by our military.' With tensions high, Russia earlier expressed fury that Kiev had blocked the 270-vehicle convoy for more than week, stressing the lorries contained 2000 tons of aid including baby food and bottled water. 'We can no longer stand this outrage, these open-faced lies and [Kiev's] refusal to reach an agreement. Russia has decided to act', said the Russian foreign ministry. By last night, Russian customs had allowed all the convoy's vehicles to pass its border post, but Ukrainian officials said they had inspected hardly any of the vehicles after being 'blocked'. A Ukrainian soldier inspects a destroyed tank allegedly belonging to pro-Russian militants near Lugansk . The area of eastern Ukraine, where the 'aid' convoy is destined, has seen some of the heaviest fighting . Uneasy calm: Ukrainian troops patrol the streets of a village in the Lugansk region . A spokesman Kiev's border guard service said: 'The trucks that underwent customs clearance have started moving on the territory of Ukraine while a group of Ukrainian border guards and customs officers was blocked in Russia's Donetsk checkpoint.' The convoy 'started moving at 11.20am without being accompanied by ICRC [International Committee of the Red Cross] representatives and in breach of the existing agreements about customs clearance of the cargo'. Kiev last night pledged not to attack the convoy with war planes but defence minister Valeriy Heletey vowed to revenge the act. 'Let's wait a little bit, and the response will be appropriate', he said. An official inspects damage to the Local History Museum in Donetsk after an attack by Ukrainian forces .

A pro-Russian gunman inspects damage in Donetsk after overnight shelling hit a residential area . At least 415,800 people have had to flee their homes due to fighting, the UN refugee agency said . For the past week the lorries have been holed up next to a Russian military base close to the border, amid fears by Ukraine that some of the lorries contained military equipment. The Red Cross said of the convoy: 'We are no way part of it.' Ukraine this weekend marks its Independence Day with a parade in Kiev organised by boxer turned mayor Vitali Klitschko, who vowed that after the show of patriotism soldiers and tanks taking part would immediately head to rebel regions to fight. But the country's economy is in dire straits due to the civil war in which 2,200 have so far died, as Yatsenyuk admitted. 'Can Ukraine now survive without Russian gas? No, it can't. How much Russian gas do we need to buy? About 5 billion cubic meters,' he said. The Red Cross reported heavy shelling overnight in the rebel-held bastion of Lugansk where the Russian trucks were heading. The Russian Red Cross said today it could help distribute the aid in Lugansk. 'We are ready to take part,' said a spokesman. Ukrainian customs officers said they had completed customs clearance for just 34 of the lorries. A burning effigy of Vladimir Putin was the main attraction at a children's festival in Ukraine.

"Could it get any worse? President Obama is riding a wave of public disgust with his health insurance overhaul that threatens to put him decidedly into Jimmy Carter territory. His latest public approval rating, just 37 per cent, is the lowest measured by a major poll since he took office. A month ago, that number was 46 per cent: low but manageable for a president in his second term. But the Affordable Care Act's disastrous website launch, and its accompanying millions-strong wave of insurance cancellation letters, appear to have damaged the president more deeply than his administration's earlier scandals, judging from Wednesday's CBS News poll numbers. That's because more and more Americans either have their own Obamacare horror stories to tell, or have heard them from people they know personally. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Why the long face? Obama's shine has lost its luster and his poll numbers are in the toilet . Awkward: On Wednesday Obama presented the Presidential Medal of Freedom to former President Bill Clinton, the politician who did more than anyone else to send Democrats running for Obamacare's exit ramp . The outrage-laden Benghazi affair was always explosive, but never hit home with Americans who don't have direct contact with the military. The Internal Revenue Service's tea party scandal only resonated with the Republican Party's right wing. But just as the Washington, D.C. press corps found its aggressive voice when the Department of Justice admitted spying on reporters, Americans who have been personally touched by Obamacare's ham-fisted rollout are venting their spleens – to pollsters, at least. And the pool of disaffected taxpayers is growing. Compare Obama's numbers to those of President George W. Bush at the height of public angst over the Iraq war, and the depth of his PR nightmare becomes clear. Once promising, Obama's historical legacy now seems doomed to feature his flailing health insurance agenda . At this point in his presidency, Bush's rating was 35 per cent, just two points away from where the foundering Obama presidency now sits. Ronald Reagan sat at 65 per cent approval in the first November of his second term in office. Bill Clinton's number was 58 at that point. No gloating, Speaker Boehner: Congressional Republicans are faring worse than the president, with just 21 per cent of Americans approving of their job performance . Key constituencies are abandoning Obama  in droves. He has lost ten full percentage points in women's approval since October, now winning over just 39 per cent of them. He has also lost nine points among men, only 34 per cent of whom back his job performance. Worst of all, Obama's support among swing-voting independents has dropped like a rock. Just 29 per cent of them now say they view his presidency in a positive light, a loss of 12 points since October. A month into the national experiment with healthcare.gov, just 1 in 10 Americans believe the project is going well. Two-thirds say it isn't. A paltry seven per cent say the Affordable Care Act should be left in place as-is. A far larger group, 48 per cent, now want it repealed. The rest favor keeping the law with some changes. As the president's coat-tails shorten, Democrats in tight 2014 congressional races have begun to walk away from him. And Hillary Clinton, the likely Democratic standard-bearer in 2016, has used her husband, the former president, to put distance between herself and the current White House. Bill Clinton made waves when he said Obama should honor his promise to let Americans keep their health insurance policies if they wanted to. Clinton's comments started both sides of the political aisle on a sprint to craft a proposal doing just that, and Obama himself pre-empted Congress with his own announcement last week.","Obama's approval sits at an all-time-low 37 per cent .

Classmates said today the middle-class teenager, who loved heavy metal music, felt he was an ‘outcast’ and would isolate himself in school. One girl, from his art class, said: 'He was very bright though, he was in the top sets for everything and was good  at drawing too. I've heard he comes from a loving family and his family love him'. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Gamer: This is believed to be the boy, pictured wearing a gaming network T-shirt, who has been was arrested by police after allegedly stabbing his Spanish teacher to death in front of his class . West Yorkshire Police said today they were 'aware' of his online presence, which is 'forming part of their investigation'. The teenager was also a member of Achievement . Hunter- a gaming community - and would challenge and interact with other . PS3 players online. His . Facebook profile picture shows him wearing one of the website's . T-shirts, which would have been ordered from the United States. They said he had previously threatened to commit suicide after complaining of bullying and had experimented with drugs. Neighbours added that he would not make eye contact with them or acknowledge their greetings as he walked past. Last night friends told of their shock at the schoolboy’s arrest. They said his mother – a human resources manager who separated from his father, a council executive, a decade ago – had always seemed a responsible, attentive parent. Classmates at Corpus Christi Catholic School described the alleged killer as a loner, who did well in all subjects apart from Spanish, and said he had seemed increasingly troubled in  recent months. ‘He was apparently suicidal and had tried to kill himself several times,’ a former pupil said. ‘He used to say he was being bullied and he was really weird. He was really quiet though and didn’t say much.’ Another ex-pupil said the 15-year-old often went into school carrying Jack Daniels and beer and that he was a ‘goth’ who drew circles on the floor, claiming to worship the devil. A third said: ‘He was an outcast. He was bullied in year 7 but then he got a few friends. One of the teachers used to chat to him about his family issues. Bright boy who became a loner: The 15-year-old pupil that stabbed Mrs Maguire felt he was an 'outcast' Loved: Pupils described Ann Maguire, 61, as the heart of Corpus Christi College, where she taught generations . He added: ‘He came to a party a few weeks ago and he took some paracetamol beforehand. He used to take drugs all the time.’ But fellow pupil Jacob Hill, 16, of Leeds, said: ‘He had gone through stages of depression and used to be on anti-depressants. ‘He was really clever and always got top grades. He was fine in everything apart from Spanish.’ Matthew Calvert, also 16, was in some classes with the suspect and described him as ‘strange’. On his Facebook page, along with the Grim Reaper drawing and links to British heavy metal bands Enter Shikari and Bring Me The Horizon, he had posted a picture of himself dressed in black with long hair. But neighbours of his 47-year-old mother, in a cul-de-sac in a quiet Leeds suburb, said he had recently cut his hair very short. 'He would never look at anybody. He would literally walk face-down to the ground with his bag on his back' He had lived in the semi-detached house in distance from the school for around ten years, with his 19-year-old brother – a musician with a up-and-coming local rock band who is studying at college. As police examined the house yesterday, neighbours said the only times they saw the 15-year-old was when he walked to school or took the family’s Bassett hound dog out. Rebecca Hardy, 21, said: ‘He would never look at anybody. He would literally walk face-down to the ground with his bag on his back. Once or twice I’ve tried to get him to make eye contact and smiled, but he’s never let on.’ She added: ‘They’re both quiet boys – if you said hello they probably wouldn’t say hello back. I would say they were a bit weird.’ Her 47-year-old father Steve Gill, added: ‘They’re a very quiet family. If there was a street party, they wouldn’t come – they’re just that sort of people.’ But another neighbour said: ‘He’s the last person round here I’d expected to be involved in something like this. He’s never caused any trouble in the street. In fact, he’s always seemed quite shy. Police arrested the boy at the scene at Corpus Christi college yesterday and searched his parents' houses . ‘His mother’s always seemed really nice, she’s got a good job and seemed to be doing a good job of bringing up two teenagers alone. ‘She would have been absolutely horrified to learn it was her son who is suspected of doing this.’ The boy’s father – who jokes on Facebook that he acts as a ‘roadie’ for his elder son’s rock band – lives in a row of £350,000 terraced houses in a pretty village outside Leeds, with his partner and their young child. He has just turned 50 and Happy Birthday balloons were visible in the windows yesterday. But he was not at home and police forensics teams appeared to be searching the property. A neighbour said: ‘They are a professional family – they get up and go to work. You’d never expect something like this. ‘They moved in a few years ago. They’re a nice family, they’ve got a young child, about two or three. What an awful thing to happen.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Schoolboy posted about Dark Souls and Grand Theft Auto games .

Ian Fogg, director of mobile at IHS tweeted: 'I’m unconvinced that Nokia is convinced by the Lumia 2520 tablet: only three announced launch countries: US,UK and Finland. 'The Lumia 1320 is an outstanding smartphone for the $339 pre tax/subsidy, large and heavy, but delivers a good experience for the price.

"At what age and stage do you finally give up on finding the 'perfect' partner? One study found the average woman will kiss 15 men, have two-long term relationships and have her heart broken twice before she finds the person she'll settle down with. But what if you're way past that, still counting and still not found the right person? Scroll down for video . Tracey says that if he or she is the one then you should see your relationship as a place of safety and support not a battleground where you have to be on your guard . Is it sensible to settle for that perfectly-nice-but-not-perfect relationship you're in? Or are you settling for second best? Fifteen relationship books, umpteen columns and two decades of researching sex and relationships later, here's what I think are the crucial questions to ask yourself. Do you only ever date one 'type'? The more varied your dating habits and the more different types of people you know and go out with, the more chance you have of finding someone who will truly make you happy. Look back at your last five relationships: have you just dated the same person, over and over and still not happy? If this is you, don't settle with the person you're with. Deliberately date someone who is completely different than what you're used to and see how that makes you feel. What personality type are you? How important is chemistry to you? The kneejerk reaction is 'Very!' and if you're an intense person, hang out for someone you feel a strong, powerful connection with. Feeling content with your partner should make you feel warm and fuzzy rather than anxious and nervous . But if the word 'content' makes you feel warm and fuzzy rather than ancient and anxious, it's perfectly possible to click with someone and have a lovely time together without ever feeling the Hollywood version of 'chemistry' with that person. Controlled 'sensible' relationships suit lots of people. If you're quite happy being with your partner and it's your friends telling you it's not passionate enough, ignore them and stick with your instincts. Are you settling or compromising? There's an enormous difference. In the first scenario, you're actively acknowledging that you're effectively settling for less than you think you deserve. The natural reaction to that is to feel resentful and cheated by life. Finally learning to compromise is a totally different feeling. It's more like 'OK, so they don't have all the qualities on my wish list but they do have what I now realise are the important ones and I can live with what's missing'. That decision sits well with most people. It's more 'Oh well, turns out you really can't have it all!' than feeling depressed and disappointed in the future. Tracey says that even if the sex is great it doesn't necessarily mean it's true love . Have you made peace with all your demons? You have to be in the right place to meet the right person. If you're still battling all sorts of issues from your past, struggling to recover from a toxic ex and generally not sorted, you are not going to have a great relationship with anyone you meet, no matter how fabulous they are. Do you view relationships as a place of safety, where you'll feel supported and loved and have fun? Or as a battleground, where you have to be on guard and protect yourself because you might get hurt? If it's the latter, how you feel has nothing to do with who you're with, it's to do with issues you need to fix. Get some therapy and then decide how you feel. Don't confuse drama with love . Some personalities are strongly attracted to each other but don't bring out the best in each other. Trouble is, the intermittent reinforcement - the rollercoaster emotional effect - makes us think this must be love. It's not. These are the dramatic love scenarios we're used to seeing in movies and reading in books. It's fiction! The average good relationship wouldn't be entertaining enough because when you both respect and like each other, there aren't massive ups and downs. Don't equate drama with love. If you're worried you're settling because there aren't any arguments or tension and everything is easy, stop worrying. That's called high compatibility. How's the sex? Most people don't end up settling down with the person they have the most wicked sex with. Why? Sometimes it's because women don't do the really out-there stuff with a man they think is future husband material (fears of being judged). Other times it's because what we look for in a long-term partner (reliability, commitment, stability), isn't what we look for in someone we're having a hot fling with (spontaneity, someone who's forbidden and 'bad' for us). This doesn't mean you won't have great sex with the right person, just a different kind of sex. If you're thinking you're settling because the sex isn't as good as it was with that wild ex, you're being unrealistic. Sex with anyone calms down over time: it doesn't mean you're settling if you're not doing it seven times a week or having earth-shattering orgasms every time.

"President Barack Obama could be in the doghouse with his mother-in-law after suggesting Bo, the family pet, has more charisma than her. He was quick to correct his Freudian slip in a campaign speech he made yesterday in Davenport, Iowa. After his wife Michelle addressed the crowd, Obama took the podium and said: ‘Let's face it, on the charisma rankings in my household, you've got her (Michelle), the girls, Bo and then my mother-in-law and then me.’ Freudian slip: After Michelle Obama addressed the crowd at a campaign speech in Davenport, Iowa, Barrack took to the microphone joking that the family's dog Bo had more charisma than his mother-in-law . While Bo the Portuguese water dog has been a very public fixture at the White House, Obama realised what he had said and was quick to say his mother-in-law Marian Robinson was actually more charismatic than the dog. He said: ‘Actually my mother in law is before Bo, obviously. 'I love my mother in law too': Obama was quick to correct his comments, saying that mother-in-law Marian Robinson was in fact more charismatic than Bo the family's Portuguese water dog . The mistaken charisma rankings: According to Obama, his wife Michelle, right, his daughters Sasha and Malia, Bo the dog and then mother-in-law Marian Robinson, left . ‘I love my mother-in-law, too - that’s where Michelle got her looks from.’ Mrs Robinson lives with the family in the White House after Obama became the first American president to appoint a ‘First Grandmother’ in 2008 to look after his daughters. But perhaps Bo, who is never far from the political limelight, is Obama’s favoured companion in the White House. The First Dog was a gift from Senator Edward Kennedy and his wife to Obama’s daughters Sasha, 11, and Malia, 14, who had been promised a dog by their father when he was on the presidential campaign trail. Family fixture: Bo has won many hearts across America but none more than Obama's daughters Malia and Sasha, far right . Happy families? All under the White House roof, Obama was the first president to allow his children's grandmother to live with them . Bo has also been the subject of political swipes at Mitt Romney after he was confronted in January over his admission that he tied his family dog on the roof of his car during a 12-hour drive. Obama’s aide David Axelrod then tweeted a photo of the U.S. President in the back of his armoured limousine alongside the Bo with the caption ‘How loving owners transport their dogs’. The Obama campaign also launched a Facebook page called 'Pet Lovers for Obama' - featuring a magnet with Bo's photograph saying: 'I bark for Barack.' The page invites supporters to submit photos of their pets in Obama 2012 gear. In 2009 the White House even released a basketball card featuring Bo which coincided with the release of his official White House portrait.

"Vincent Kompany insists that Manchester City were 'forced' to spend big again this summer to offset the loss of players leaving the Etihad. The Premier League champions brought in the likes of Eliquiam Mangala, Fernando and Willy Cabellero as well as signing free agents Frank Lampard and Bacary Sagna as they strive to meet Financial Fair Play restrictions. Captain Kompany believes the deals - both signing new players and extending existing contracts - were essential if the club wants to remain competitive. Captain fantastic: Vincent Kompany believes Manchester United were 'forced' to make reinforcements . Patriot games: Kompany challenges Tim Cahill during Belgium's international friendly with Australia . Speaking to France Football, he said: 'The summer reinforcements? People should see that as logical for a team like us, to get reinforcements every year. 'We are forced to. That is a fact. Joleon Lescott is leaving? We must get reinforcements for that position. Javi Garcia is leaving us? We have to add a player in that position.' The Belgium international committed to a new long-term deal this summer along with fellow leading players Samir Nasri, David Silva, Sergio Aguero and Yaya Toure. Incoming: Bacary Sagna, playing here for France, was one of several big names to arrive at the Etihad . One in, one out? England defender Joleon Lescott (R) left City for West Brom . 'To me the most important thing was not that I signed, but that I saw David Silva, Samir Nasri, Aleksandar Kolarov and Yaya Toure doing the same,' he added. 'That was a strong signal. All of those players could play for the top teams in the world, but they have decided to show faith in City and the project at the club.

"The average person who uses social media has romantic or sexual conversations with two people other than their current partner. These results from a new US study (University of Indiana) echo many others: that 'remote infidelity' - loving or sexual interaction that doesn't involve physical contact - is on the rise. But the jury divides sharply on the effect this will have on our relationships. The average person has romantic or sexual conversations on social networks with two people other than their current partner . Some consider it not just an alarm bell but a loudly clanging church-tower size one - as harmful to the relationship as in-person one-night-stands or affairs. Others believe this is nothing new, that people in love have always flirted (usually without intent) and it's not cheating if body parts don't touch. They also believe - crucially - that what your partner doesn't know, won't hurt the relationship. Surprising (to the people with the first mindset but not the second), the University of Indiana research actually found no correlation between people who had saucy or soppy chats with others and their commitment to the relationship. Which sparks another, rather interesting question. Regardless of whether cheating is in the flesh or 'remote' and digital, if your partner doesn't know about it, does it really matter? Tracey says that if we get away with cheating it can make us judge our partner for being too naïve . Whether we're talking about good old-fashioned in-the-flesh infidelity or the online version, if you don't blab to big-mouthed friends, there's absolutely no chance you'd ever get found out, have MI5 standard passwords on all your accounts, never plan to see them again (or never have, if it's digital), you had safe sex (if in person) and it meant nothing, what harm can cheating really do? Some people (usually the less faithful type) say it depends totally on your personality. If you genuinely see nothing wrong with what you did and your motivation was solely opportunity, how could cheating possibly harm your relationship? Your partner is none the wiser and your behaviour towards them hasn't altered. Where's the problem? Well, here's a few. Lots of people do get caught - ironically, more so with 'remote' infidelity than physical because once you're online there's a more visible, documented and (remarkably easy to find) trace. There goes the 'they'll never find out' defence. But even if you did manage to commit the perfect infidelity crime, very few people truly believe there's nothing wrong with cheating. Even the smoothest, slickest serial offender, fond of boasting of their conquests to equally unfaithful friends, is aware they're doing something wrong. And this is where it all unravels. Knowing we've done something that would hurt our partner subtly alters our perception of them. You got away with something, so you're one up on them. This makes them appear either naïve and too trusting or vulnerable and hopelessly helpless. Good relationships are based on mutual admiration and respect, not pitying your partner or secretly thinking they're stupid. My conclusion? I'm sticking with what I've always said about infidelity. If you want to know if what you're doing is cheating, ask yourself this question: Would my partner be upset if they could see what I'm doing right now? If you answer yes, then you're cheating. Continue doing what you're doing after you've answered yes and you're effectively saying 'I don't care about my partner's feelings'. In person or online, let's not kid ourselves. It all means something. For more of Tracey's thoughts on love and relationships, visit traceycox.com.","The average person has romantic conversations with two people online .

"The technology may still be in its infancy, but flexible screens are gradually being seen in more and more products. Samsung and LG have led the way, so far, but a number of other firms including Japan’s Semiconductor Energy Laboratory are also developing super-strong, flexible screens. At an exhibition in Tokyo, the firm demonstrated its latest breakthrough - a 5.9-inch display that can be bent more than 100,000 times without being damaged. Scroll down for video . The latest flexible display (pictured) was demonstrated at the Display Innovation exhibition in Tokyo by Japan’s Semiconductor Energy Laboratory. Its display features organic light emitting diodes and measures 5.9-inches . The foldable display is made of layers of lights using organic light emitting diodes (OLED). It features touch sensors, meaning it works as a touchscreen at all angles and curvatures, and was demonstrated at the Display Innovation exhibition in Yokohama. During the demonstration, the screen featured images of landscapes, cats and peacocks that bent and curved with the display. A number of the curved screens, including those created by LG and Samsung, use high molecular substance-based polyimide film. This forms the backplane of the flexible panel and is used as an alternative to plastic. The material makes it possible to achieve the maximum curvature radius, which in Semiconductor Energy Laboratroy's display is 0.7-inches (2mm). Polyimide film also helped reduce the thickness of the panel to significantly improve its flexibility. It was seen curving over the edge of a handset, similar to the screen on Samsung’s Galaxy Note Edge. Samsung unveiled the Galaxy Note Edge in September. Because the display pops out of the phone, it can even be used when the cover is closed. The curved screen can also display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption. The curved screen can additionally display notifications at the top and bottom while viewing a video without disruption. The right-hand side of the Edge, which is curved, is where notifications and other icons appear. It is the second phone released by the Korean firm that features curved display technology, following the Galaxy Round in October last year. LG’s G Flex phone has a similar design, and both firms are pioneering curved TVs. During tests, the display was bent more than 100,000 times and didn’t lose performance.

Videos of the device show it being bent and stood on, as well as being cut with a pair of scissors without the images on the display being affected. The prototype is what's known as an 'active matrix electrophoretic display'. It's similar to the screens used in e-readers, but is made of flexible plastic instead of glass. In contrast to traditional displays, the pixel electronics, or backplane, of this display includes  graphene electrodes. These electrodes replay metal electrodes in other devices.

"Doctor Who star David Tennant has vowed to remain silent on the Scottish independence debate, claiming he has ‘no right’ to share his opinion because he no longer lives there. It comes after fellow Scottish-born actor Sir Sean Connery, who now lives in the Bahamas, came out strongly in favour of independence ahead of next month’s referendum. Earlier this year, the 83-year-old said ending the union with England was an opportunity ‘too good to miss’ – but Tennant has now declared that ‘there is nothing more odious than actors foisting their opinions around.’ Scroll down for video . David Tennant (left) has vowed to remain silent on the Scottish independence debate, claiming he has no right to share opinion because he no longer lives there. It comes after Sir Sean Connery (right) came out in favour . In March, Sir Sean said: ‘As a Scot and as someone with a lifelong love for both Scotland and the arts, I believe the opportunity of independence is too good to miss. Simply put - there is no more creative an act than creating a new nation.’ However, Tennant, 43, who starred in the BBC1 show for three series, has now responded by claiming opinion-sharing on the debate is better left to politicians. The actor, who was born in Bathgate, West Lothian, Scotland, but who now lives in London, told The Sunday Times: ‘As I chose to leave Scotland many years ago now I forfeited my right to tell Scottish residents how to run the country. ‘And anyway, there is nothing more odious than actors foisting their opinions around. I’m very happy to leave that to the politicians who are – hopefully – so much better placed and informed.’ It comes after a lengthy debate in which hundreds of high-profile celebrities have come out either in favour of the Yes Scotland campaign - spearheaded by Alex Salmond - or the Better Together campaign, launched by Alistair Darling.

"Tragic: Air Force veteran Ronald Westbrook was shot on Wednesday morning . The Georgia man who shot a 72-year-old who had Alzheimer's, after he wandered into his yard at 4am, could use the Stand Your Ground law if charged. It is not yet clear if Joe Hendrix will be charged after shooting dead the Air Force veteran on Wednesday, but police said it was clear the 34-year-old felt threatened. The sheriff's office said Mr Hendrix should have stayed in his house, but he broke no laws by confronting Ronald Westbrook, who he thought was an intruder. Walker County Sheriff Steve Wilson told Fox News he believed Mr Hendrix did feel threatened and that the state's Stand Your Ground law may apply. Under the law, a person is permitted to use force if they feel they are under physical threat. They do not have to retreat, even if backing down is a possibility. Mr Westbrook, who was married and had three children, knocked on the door of the rented house Mr Hendrix and his fiancee had moved to only two weeks ago. 'He had traveled about 2.6 miles from his home to the shooting location by foot with a wind chill of about 20 degrees, very loosely clothed with his two dogs,' Sheriff Wilson told WRCB TV. As Mr Hendrix called out commands Mr Westbrook, who talked slowly, continued to walk towards him, The Times Free Press reported.

"In five per cent of companies in the U.S., employees who need extra time off don't need to negotiate with their managers - they can simply buy the days they need.These companies allow their workers to buy and sell vacation time, a perk that gives workers more flexibility in managing their time off.The novel approach might help employees buy some extra days off to take the trip of a lifetime or spend more time with a newborn. Co-workers could sell off unused days to get some extra money. Clocking in: Companies pro-rate a week's extra vacation time over a whole year so that it makes a minimal dent in an employee paycheck . 'When times are a little tight, this benefit really doesn't cost a lot of extra money to employers to provide,' said Julie Stich, research director for the International Foundation of Employee Benefit Plans. 'It's offered by more forward-thinking or flexible-type employers.'A soon-to-be released survey by the Society for Human Resource Management found that nine per cent of employers allow workers to cash out unused vacation time. Five per cent let employees purchase additional vacation days through a payroll deduction. An additional seven per cent allowed employees to donate vacation time to a general pool that can be used by other workers. The approach is even more popular with employers that have 'paid time off' or PTO plans that combine vacation time, sick leave and personal days into one comprehensive plan. About 52 per cent of employers reported offering such plans. Of those, 19 per cent offered a cash-out option and 15 per cent offered a donation program. One per cent give their workers unlimited time off.The cost for employee is usually one week's salary, prorated over the course of the year. Employees often have to decide whether to participate during an annual fall enrollment process and it becomes part of their benefits for the upcoming year.Nora Kouba, who manages company cars at construction materials giant USG Corp in Chicago, said she used to buy an extra week off to care for her kids or take long summer vacations with the family. But these days, she tends to sell her excess vacation time. Work/life balance: Nora Kouba, an employee at USG Corporation in Chicago, used to buy extra vacation time when her children were small; now she sells her unused time for extra cash . 'I loved having the extra week when I needed it, and now I like having the extra money,' Kouba said.USG allows all 9,000 of its employees worldwide to buy or sell up to a week of vacation time each year. A little more than half of the company's employees typically buy an extra week off, while just five per cent sell a week, USG spokesman Robert Williams said.'People really value their time and appreciate the benefit,' Williams said.USG used to allow employees to buy up to two weeks of extra vacation a year. But Williams said the plan was too popular and was cut back to just one week to avoid scheduling problems in USG's production facilities.A flexible vacation policy has been in place about for about 15 years at Kimberly-Clark Corporation, based in Irving, Texas. The company allows employees to purchase up to five extra vacation days each year during a fall enrollment period, said spokesman Bob Brand.'It's very popular,' Brand said. 'It provides a great deal of flexibility for someone that may have a big trip planned or an event that's going to take an extended amount of time.'The company does not allow employees to sell vacation days, but they can carry a limited number of unused days over into the following years. Mutually beneficial: Research has shown that happy workers are more productive workers, so extra time off works for both employers and employees . Brand said the program is open to about half of the company's 15,000 U.S. employees, so as not to interfere with production. About 2,000 workers made use of it last year.In most plans, the employees aren't actually buying and selling time from each other, Stich said. Time sold back to the company goes into a pool and in certain cases, other employees can buy it. New employees who get limited vacation time during their first few years at a company are among those who appreciate the benefit most, she said.Sandi Winant, an employee for 24 years at financial services company USAA in Colorado Springs, said she buys a week of extra vacation time every year to work on a side business selling salsas and dips at festivals and events around country. She plans to pursue the business when she retires in a year or two.'It's spread out over a whole year's paycheck so you don't even notice it,' she said. 'This gives me that extra padding to do what I want.'Jeff Weiss, senior vice president of benefits at San Antonio-based USAA, said about 41 per cent of the company's 25,000 employees bought vacation time last year, while 11 per cent sold it. Summer holiday: 41 per cent of employees at USAA buy extra vacation time, while 11 per cent sell it . 'We think time off is actually critical to productivity,' Weiss said. 'When people take their time off to refresh and renew, we believe they service the members more effectively.'Some employers have set up flexible benefit plans where employees can sell back their extra vacation in exchange for a different type of benefit they find more valuable, such as more disability insurance or life insurance, Stich said. An employee can get credits they use to buy benefits and then trade in the dollar or credit equivalency of those vacation days in exchange for other benefits they want.Evren Esen, manager of the Society for Human Resource Management's survey research center, said more companies are moving toward PTO plans that give employees more flexibility in determining how they want to use their leave.'In terms of human resources it's easier to manage it,' Esen said. 'They put everything together in one bank and don't have to separately track sick, vacation or personal days.'The PTO plans also encourages employees to schedule most of their leave time, which can be more reliable for the company than workers suddenly taking a day off on short notice, Esen said.The number of companies with PTO plans has grown from 42 per cent in 2009, to 52 per cent this year, according to the group's annual survey of more than 500 randomly selected human resource professionals.","Five per cent of companies in the U.S. allow employee to buy up to a week's extra time off per year .

"A federal judge on Thursday ordered the IRS to explain under oath how it lost a trove of emails to and from a central figure in the agency's tea party controversy. U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan gave the tax agency a month to submit the explanation in writing. Sullivan said he is also appointing a federal magistrate to see whether the lost emails can be obtained from other sources. Sullivan issued the order as part of a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit by Judicial Watch, a conservative watchdog group. He said the IRS declaration must be signed, under oath, by the appropriate IRS official. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Former official Lois Lerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status when, the agency says, her hard drive crashed, destroying untold numbers of emails . 'I'm going to hold tight to that Aug. 10 declaration,' Sullivan said. The IRS says it lost the emails in 2011 when Lois Lerner's computer crashed. At the time, Lerner headed the IRS division that processes applications for tax-exempt status. She has since retired. Lerner, who refused to answer questions at two House committee hearings, has become a central figure in several congressional investigations over the handling of tea party applications. At both hearings, Lerner cited her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself. IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has testified on the lost emails before Congress at least three times. Each time he was under oath. Koskinen said he first learned there was a problem with Lerner's computer in February but didn't learn that emails were lost until April. The IRS notified Congress June 13. Judicial Watch lawyer Ramona Cotca complained that the IRS never informed her group or the court about the lost emails, even though Sullivan had ordered the IRS to produce documents related to the information request on a monthly basis. U.S. District Judge Emmet G. Sullivan ordered the IRS to declare under oath what happened to Lerner's emails . Geoffrey Klimas, a Justice Department . lawyer representing the IRS, said the agency had no legal obligation to . tell Judicial Watch about emails that may have been destroyed two years . before the group filed its request for information. Judicial Watch filed a series of requests with the IRS shortly after the tea party controversy erupted in May 2013. Among its requests, the watchdog group wanted communications Lerner had with others concerning the handling of applications for tax-exempt status since Jan. 1, 2010. Judicial Watch filed a lawsuit against the IRS in October, saying the agency didn't produce any documents. Since then, the IRS started to produce some documents in February, Cotca said. On Thursday, Cotca asked Sullivan to conduct a limited discovery to determine what happened to the emails, perhaps compelling testimony from IRS officials. But Sullivan said that would be premature. Klimas noted that the tax agency's inspector general is conducting an investigation into the lost emails. Klimas said the inspector general has asked the IRS not to question witnesses that may have information about the lost emails to avoid interfering with its investigation. Sullivan said the sworn IRS statement should include information about the inspector general's concerns. Sullivan said he would assign federal magistrate John Facciola to look into ways of obtaining the IRS records from other sources, though it is unclear how much information could be recovered. Internal Revenue Service Commissioner John Koskinen has already testified under oath that Lerner's emails were unrecoverable, and drew gasps in a House hearing room when he said the agency had already destroyed and recycled her hard drive . In 2011, the IRS had a policy of backing up emails on computer tapes, but the tapes were recycled every six months, Koskinen told Congress. He said Lerner's hard drive was recycled and presumably destroyed, after technicians in the agency's criminal investigations unit tried unsuccessfully to restore it. The IRS was able to generate 24,000 Lerner emails from the 2009 to 2011 period because she had copied in other IRS employees, Koskinen said. As part of the congressional investigations, the IRS said it is producing a total of 67,000 emails to and from Lerner, covering the period from 2009 to 2013. IRS lawyers are due back in federal court Friday before a different judge for a hearing on the lost emails in a separate lawsuit filed by a group called True the Vote. The group, which says it advocates for the integrity of elections, sued the IRS over delays in its application for tax-exempt status.","U.S. District Judge Emmet G.

"Lawsuit: Lena Dunham has threatened to sue the website Truth Revolt for millions of dollars after they accused her of being a sexual abuser last week . Lena Dunham is now threatening to sue the right-wing website which last week published an article claiming she sexually abused her little sister when they were children. The claim is based on an excerpt from the Girls star and creator's new book, Not That Kind of Girl, and details how she once looked at her sister Grace's vagina when her sibling was a year old and she was seven. Lena defended the action as innocent childhood exploration based on curiosity, but the website Truth Revolt called the memory 'unsettling' and 'disturbing'. Since then, she has been in a war of words with the site, which refused to take down or apologize for their piece titled 'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister'. On Tuesday, the website claimed that the actress was threatening to sue them and that was confirmed today when The Hollywood Reporter published the full cease and desist letter written by Lena's lawyers. In the letter, attorney Charles Harder calls the Truth Revolt article 'completely false and fabricated, and highly defamatory of' his client. He goes on to demand the website take the article down and apologize for it, or else face a multi-million dollar lawsuit. If they don't follow instructions to take the article down, Harder says Lena will 'vigorously pursue all legal remedies'. The website adamantly declined, and editor Ben Shapiro wrote another article on Tuesday explaining why they would not heed to the demands of Lena's lawyers. 'We refuse. We refuse to withdraw our story or apologize for running it, because quoting a woman’s book does not constitute a “false” story, even if she is a prominent actress and left-wing activist. 'Lena Dunham may not like our interpretation of her book, but unfortunately for her and her attorneys, she wrote that book – and the First Amendment covers a good deal of material she may not like, the article reads. Scroll down for video . Allegations: In a story published last week, Truth Revolt writes that Lena (right) sexually abused her little sister Grace (left) when they were children. The claim is based on a personal essay included in Lena's new book . The passage that Truth Revolt excerpted details a conversation that then 7-year-old Lena had with her mother, famed artist Laurie Simmons, about women's organs. In the course of the conversation, young Lena asks her mother if little sister Grace's vagina looks like hers. 'I guess so, Just smaller,' her mother responds . 'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing with blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the best of me,' Dunham writes . Memory: In Not That Kind of Girl, Lena writes about looking at her then 1-year-old sister Grace's vagina out of curiosity after talking with their mother about the female reproductive system. Lena was seven at the time. Grace Dunham pictured at a film screening last June . 'Grace was sitting up, babbling and smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina. She didn’t resist and when I saw what was inside I shrieked. 'My mother came running. “Mama, Mama! Grace has something in there!” 'My mother didn’t bother asking why I had opened Grace’s vagina. This was within the spectrum of things I did. 'She just got on her knees and looked for herself. It quickly became apparent that Grace had stuffed six or seven pebbles in there. My mother removed them patiently while Grace cackled, thrilled that her prank had been a success.' It was also in the book that Lena described coaxing her sister for affection. 'As [Grace] grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a 'motorcycle chick.' Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. 'Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just 'relax on me.' Basically, anything a sexual predator might to do woo a small suburban girl I was trying.' Truth Revolt  called this passages 'unsettling' and 'disturbing' in an article titled  'Lena Dunham Describes Sexually Abusing Her Little Sister' The article reads: 'Lena Dunham describes experimenting sexually with her younger sister Grace, whom she says she attempted to persuade to kiss her using “anything a sexual predator might do.” In one particularly unsettling passage, Dunham experimented with her six-year younger sister’s vagina.' They also originally wrote that Dunham was 17 at the time of the incident, and later added a correction saying 'This article has been modified to correct a typo in the book excerpt incorrectly listing Dunham's age as seventeen'. Lena initially addressed the claims in a Twitter rant over the weekend, and spoke out against the story again on Tuesday with a statement to Time magazine, writing how she was 'dispayed' with the interpretation of the story. 'First and foremost, I want to be very clear that I do not condone any kind of abuse under any circumstances. 'Childhood sexual abuse is a life-shattering event for so many, and I have been vocal about the rights of survivors. 'If the situations described in my book have been painful or triggering for people to read, I am sorry, as that was never my intention. 'I am also aware that the comic use of the term “sexual predator” was insensitive, and I’m sorry for that as well,' Lena writes, adding that her sister is her best friend and supported her publishing the childhood memory in her book. In the wake of the allegations, Lena has cancelled two stops on her book tour scheduled this week in Belgium and Germany claiming she is having health issues. On Monday,  she tweeted that she was 'deeply sorry' to miss the Antwerp Book Fair and a signing in Berlin, adding that she's 'so grateful for your energy and support'. Sibling support: Grace Dunham has spoken out to defend her sister's story and her right to write about childhood memories. The sisters pictured above in London on October 29, promoting Lena's new book . The website has refused to apologize for the article. Do you find anything wrong with Lena Dunham's childhood actions? Do you find anything wrong with Lena Dunham's childhood actions? Now share your opinion . 'If Ms. Dunham says that our quotations from her book were “false,” or that our interpretation of those events was libelous under the law, then we look forward to asking her, in her deposition, about why they appeared in her book,' editor Ben Shapiro wrote on Tuesday. 'We also look forward to asking her why she believes it is now appropriate for a 28-year-old woman to make light of opening her baby sister’s vagina, paying her with candies for prolonged kisses on the lips in the manner of a “sexual predator,” or masturbating in bed next to her prepubescent sister,' he added. Grace Dunham also appears to have responded to the allegations in her own Twitter rant on Monday, writing vaguely about heternormativity and what is and is not considered 'normal' behavior. Grace writes that she supports writers 'narrating their own experiences, determining for themselves what has and has not been harmful'. She also posted: '2day, like every other day, is a good day to think about how we police the sexualities of young women, queer, and trans people.' While the tweets seem to address the criticism of her sister's essay, they do not directly come out and support the personal story that her sister shared with the world. The sisters appear to have a difference of opinion on the Truth Revolt article, according to one tweet Lena wrote on Saturday. 'Sometimes I get so mad I burn write up. Also, I wish my sister wasn't laughing so hard,' Dunham tweeted on November 1.","A legal letter leaked Wednesday, shows that Lena Dunham is planning to sue the website Truth Revolt for accusing her of molestation .

"Created: . 20:05 EST, 1 December 2013 . Researchers suggest migraine sufferers should limit their risk of exposure to BPA by cutting out the use of plastic microwave trays and refillable bottles . Drinking water from water coolers or refillable bottles could be giving millions of Britons headaches. New research shows that a controversial ‘gender-bending’ chemical in synthetic packaging may trigger migraines. Bisphenol A (BPA) has already been linked to a range of heath problems including obesity, infertility and heart attacks. Now the latest study – published in the journal Toxicological Sciences – points to BPA causing the debilitating headaches which afflict one in seven UK adults. The authors urge sufferers to strip . out potential sources of contamination from their daily diet, which . include plastic microwave trays, refillable bottles and office water coolers. Their . report states: 'A previously performed study using a ""fresh foods"" dietary intervention demonstrated a significant decrease in urinary BPA . (66 per cent reduction) in patients after just three days. 'These findings combined with our . results suggest that a clinical trial to decrease BPA exposure and . levels in migraine sufferers...may reduce headache frequency and/or . severity, revealing strategies that may increase the quality of life of . migraineurs.' The University of Kansas study emulated human exposure to BPA in the laboratory. Researchers observed the behaviour of rats, half of whom were administered the chemical once every three days. Within half an hour of the dose, those exposed to BPA became less active, steered clear of loud noise and strong light, were easily startled and showed signs of tenderness to the head. The rats’ brains also gave off telltale signals of an influx of oestrogen. Migraines have been linked to sudden changes in levels of the female sex hormone, which BPA mimics. The report states: 'The behavioural measures used [were] designed to model many of the symptoms humans experience during a migraine attack. 'Rats exposed to BPA demonstrated significantly augmented migraine-like behaviours. 'These results imply that BPA has the ability to amplify symptoms that are used to diagnose the disorder in human patients, suggesting that exposure to BPA would increase both the incidence and prevalence of this disorder.' Around five million Britons suffer from migraines though women are three times more likely to have them. Neurologist Dr Fayyaz Ahmed, of the Migraine Trust charity, said: 'We know Bisphenol A is used in materials such as food packaging, plastics and tins. 'In most sufferers, attacks are genetically linked and the triggers only generate them in those who are predisposed. 'But if BPA is implicated in the genesis of migraines than this would certainly be a milestone in headache research.' Bisphenol A is so commonplace because of the range of products it’s found in, everything from car dashboards to shower curtains to till receipts and cosmetics. Countries across the world – including EU member states, Canada and China - have moved to ban the chemical from baby bottles. The previous study which tested a ‘fresh foods’ diet picked families from San Francisco who ate canned food and were exposed to BPA through at least two of four other sources: drinking from refillable water bottles; drinking from office water coolers; eating meals away from home and eating eating meals microwaved in plastic.","New study suggests Bisphenol A (BPA) may cause debilitating headaches .

"Amanda Bynes has denied denied ever doing drugs after being charged in court for reckless endangerment. She took to Twitter to plead her innocence hours after her turning up at a New York court in connection with claims she threw a marijuana bong out of her Manhattan apartment building. The 27-year-old former child star, who looked dishevelled in a blonde wig and jogging bottoms, was arrested Thursday evening after building officials at her midtown apartment called police to complain she was rolling a joint and smoking cannabis in the lobby. In court: Amanda Bynes was in a disheveled state as she faced the judge with her messy wig on in New York on Friday . Two mug shots: The actress posed with her wig on following her arrest on Thurdsday, but was later forced to remove it for her official picture . Court documents: A policeman was carrying Amanda's booking sheet . And while she made no formal plea at the appearance, she pleaded her innocence via her Twitter page and even reached for levity by making fun of her appearance. The unpredictable former Nickelodeon favourite wrote: 'I only smoke tobacco I don't drink or do drugs. I've never had a bong in my life! 'I need to get another nose job after seeing my mugshot!' However two shocking mug shots have since emerged of the former child star star. She . initially posed for a booking photo in her platinum blonde wig but was . later forced to remove it - and reveal her shaved head - for her . official police picture. She scowled in both frames and appeared to have heavy bags under her eyes. Amanda announced she shaved half her . head in April, claiming a hair stylist 'fried' it with bleach. It's unclear . exactly when she cut off the rest of her long locks. Plausible deniability?: The actress tried to persuade her followers she is a clean living young lady . The officers went to her apartment on the 36th floor where they said they saw heavy smoke and a bong sitting on the kitchen counter. They said she tossed the bong out the window in front of them, prosecutors said. A incident report quotes the officer as saying: 'I observed [Amanda] grab said bong, run to the westbound-facing window, and throw it out the window where numerous pedestrians were walking on the 8 Avenue and West 47 Street sidewalks below.' She then said to police: 'It was just a vase,' according to Manhattan assistant district attorney Chikaelo Ibeabuchi. Police returned to the apartment on Friday evening looking for more evidence and gathering witness statements, according to TMZ. The night doorman and two other apartment building employees who were there when Bynes allegedly was smoking pot in the lobby gave statements to police. Officers also went upstairs to the floor of Bynes' apartment seeking more witness statements. Struggling to keep her hair on: She adjusted her wig during the hearing . With her lawyer: Her attorney says she absolutely denies the bong-toss incident . Bynes called authorities herself during the dramatic arrest, sources tell In Touch magazine. 'She called 911, saying cops were going to assault her,' an insider told the publication. Her . attorney for the arraignment Andrew Friedman told the court: 'My client completely denies illegally . throwing anything out of her window.' He claims she was illegally followed into her apartment by police. The judge released her on her own recognizance and gave her a July 9 court date. Unrecogniseable: The Hollywood star's look has changed dramatically since her rise to fame . Friendly goodbye: She told the judge to 'have a nice day' after she was dismissed from court . Thursday, Bynes was held overnight at a . police precinct. She pulled up to court Friday morning in a squad car . where she was greeted by a crush of media. She was also charged with . attempted tampering with evidence and unlawful possession of marijuana, . all misdemeanors. 'I don't want any photos. No press are allowed in here,' she announced to the public courtroom. Her lawyer said she had no record in . New York, but the judge noted she had several out-of-state cases. In . California in December, the former Hairspray star resolved a . misdemeanor hit-and-run case after entering into a civil settlement with . other drivers. Also in California, she was charged . last fall with driving on a suspended license after it was temporarily . taken away from her after two hit-and-run cases where she was accused of . leaving the scene without providing proper information. She has also . pleaded not guilty to drunken driving in a separate case. Over: She was escorted out of the court house by police . Free to go: She left court alone in a taxi . Cover up: She used her fake hair to shield her face . Unkempt: Her pink fake nails were chipped off on some fingers . Hair-raising: Her wig was in quite a state as she headed home . Free to go: She was released without bail . In releasing her, Chief New York County Judge Neil Ross gave her a stern warning not to make trouble or miss any court dates. 'I do want to make sure you . understand,' he said. 'If you get arrested again ... I'm going to be . setting very, very significant bail.' 'OK,' she replied. Back on twitter: After court, Amanda retweeted a fans pic of her with the acronym ILYSM (I love you so much) 'You're in a very, very challenging situation right now,' he said. Assistant district attorney Ibeabuchi . had asked for $1,000 bail. He said no bong was recovered from the street . below - a sign, her attorney said, that Bynes was telling the truth. 'There was nothing recovered from the . sidewalk, clearly a search was made for the bag,' said Friedman of the . New York County Defender Services. He said she was followed illegally . into her apartment and has made a complaint about police wrongfully . entering. Bowing her head: She hid her face as she arrived for the hearing . Trouble: The former child star was in handcuffs . As the judge dispensed with her case, she said, 'Thank you sir, have a nice day.' The star then got into a waiting yellow cab ringed with photographers and TV cameras and left. The former Nickelodeon star has . been exhibiting erratic behaviour of late with some eyebrow-raising . public outings and online postings. Two men who claimed they attended an . impromptu house party at Bynes' Manhattan apartment last month said . they witnessed Bynes smoking marijuana atop a bare mattress in her . bedroom. The men told . In Touch magazine in an article this week that Bynes' home was filthy . and filled with marijuana, presenting photos to back up their claims. Hiding: The star kept her head down as she arrived in a police car . Spiral: She was arrested on charges of reckless endangerment, tampering with evidence, and criminal possession of marijuana . Document: The officer was carrying her booking sheet . The men said that Bynes' home was virtually unfurnished and windows were spray painted black. Bynes . jumped to her own defense on Wednesday night on Twitter. She posted a . tweet saying: 'That’s not my bed! Those aren’t my toes! My toes are . pedicured!' In another strange incident, TMZ . reported on Thursday that Bynes was stopped from boarding a private jet . last weekend for not having correct identification. Since her driver's license has been . suspended and she had no other form of ID, the actress told the pilot to . search her name on Google to prove her identity. Police escort: An officer walked with the handcuffed Bynes out of the New York City police station on Thursday evening . The pilot . checked with the jet company, but they were adamant that no special . treatment be given and Bynes was not allowed on the flight. Look out below: Amanda allegedly tossed a bong out of her 36th floor apartment in New York City. She told police it was 'just a vase' Her bizarre antics commenced with her retirement from acting and move last year to New York. She is regularly on Twitter and has sent out some concerning . tweets in which she asked Drake to 'murder her vagina' and posed topless . while complaining about her weight. TMZ reported . earlier this year Amanda was evicted from her apartment for being a . 'building nuisance,' as neighbours complained about smelling marijuana . smoke from her abode. The . Easy A actress moved to the Big Apple to become a fashion designer last . year, but the fruits of her labour have yet to surface. She also didn't have much luck with her 2007 clothing line, Dear, after retailer Steve & Barry's filed for bankruptcy. Amanda's concerned parents are said to be trying to get her placed under a conservatorship. Rick and Lynn Bynes have reportedly . visited several lawyers in a bid to sign over all legal, medical and . financial control of her affairs to an external party. Her parents' attempts have been unsuccessful so far, however. Movie star: Amanda starred in the 2003 film What A Girl Wants with Colin Firth . A source told RadarOnline.com: 'Rick . and Lynn have met with several lawyers that handle conservatorships in . the past month, because they want to get a conservatorship of their . daughter. They have been advised that even as disturbing as Amanda's . behaviour is, it's very unlikely that a judge would sign off on a . temporary conservatorship. 'Conservatorships are very hard to . get, and being mentally ill and addicted to drugs isn't enough. Amanda . hasn't ever been to rehab or ever agreed to see a mental health . professional. Her parents are absolutely powerless to do anything at . this point.' Bynes' unraveling is reminiscent of another former child star - Britney Spears, who also shaved her head in 2007. The pop star's father was granted a court-ordered conservatorship following the public meltdown.

"Muslims in Birmingham arranged a festival for 40,000 people to celebrate the end of the holy month of Ramadan in just 16 hours. The festival of Eid al-Fitr is a major event in the Muslim calendar where families and friends congregate the break their fast and pray. The end of Ramadan is determined by Muslim scholars in Saudi Arabia  who spotted the new moon on Sunday. Scroll down for video . Organisers of the Eid al-Fitr event in Birmingham's Small Heath Park, pictured, arranged it  in just 16 hours . Organisers . contacted Birmingham City Council in advance, securing a licence for . their festival by block-booking the event for Sunday, Monday and . Tuesday. They held their highly successful event in the Small Heath Park . in Birmingham. This is the third year Muslims have held their event in the Birmingham park on the day of Eid itself. Once . the new moon was spotted over Saudi Arabia, Ramadan would officially . finish the following day, allowing the celebration to take place. It . is understood that Monday's festival was the largest ever of its type . in the UK and, despite the short notice, catered for more that the . 35,000 people who went to Latitude in Suffolk. Prayers at the beginning of the festival took place at 9am with stalls selling halal sausages and ice cream. Millions of Muslims across the globe have been celebrating the end of the holy month of Ramadan including these worshipers at the Jama Mosque in New Delhi, India earlier this morning . These women are praying to celebrate the ending of Ramadan in London's Burgess Park . Luckily for the 40,000 Muslims celebrating Eid in Birmingham, they had far better weather than the 35,000 revelers earlier this summer attending the Latitude festival in Suffolk, pictured . Eid also provides a summer boost for retailers with the so-called 'Ramadan rush' where thousands rich people from the Middle East travel . London's department stores are bracing themselves for a 'Middle Eastern gold rush' as scores of rich Arab shoppers are expected to hit the tills in what has become known as the 'Ramadan rush'. Middle Eastern shoppers are expected to increase their summer spend by a quarter over the next three days on a quest to 'out-shop and outspend' each other as Eid al Fitr celebrations - which mark the end of the 29-day fasting period of Ramadan - begin. Around 69 per cent of the total Middle Eastern spend in August 2013 was in major department and clothing stores, like Harrods and Selfridges. Ramadan is the Muslim holy month of fasting where the observant refuse to eat or drink during daylight hours. However Muslims who are ill, pregnant or travelling can be excused from fasting. Smoking and sex is also prohibited in daylight hours during Ramadan. The timing of Ramadan changes because it is based on the Islamic lunar calendar, but it normally lasts around 30 days. As well as a time of prayer, Muslims during Ramadan are also expected to give money to the poor. Once the crescent moon is sighted, normally in Saudi Arabia, Muslims celebrate the ending of Ramadan with the festival of Eid al-Fitr. Families gather and have special prayers, give each other presents and eat sweets. Muslims often greet each other with the phrase Eid Mubarak, or 'happy Eid'.","Muslims in Birmingham managed to host 40,000 people for Eid celebration .

Stephen Sutton, 19, has just updated his Facebook profile to tell his followers that he feels very fortunate to still be here. And today, his former headteacher, Stuart Jones, has described him as 'an exceptional lad'. Stephen wrote: 'One week ago I posted a ""thumbs up farewell"" photo that went viral. As mentioned, at that point a genuinely thought I was a goner, but one week on I'm still here! Scroll down for video . Stephen Sutton has posted a new photo on Facebook (pictured) saying 'every second alive feels very special' 'Overall my time here will still be cut significantly short by my illness (...but I've known that anyway for a while anyway).

'But with my breathing fine and no other acute medical problems at the moment, we can optimistically look forward to a period of ""future"" that at the beginning of the week seemed impossible. 'It still might not be long (fingers crossed it is though) but due to the circumstances, I feel very fortunate to be here, and every second alive feels very special!! 'With more immediate time and health my medical team are currently discussing what to do next to further elongate/comfort the rest of the journey as much as possible - we should have a plan of what's happening next very soon.

Here's a huge thumbs up from me!!!!' Stephen, 19, has received hundreds of letters of support from across the world . Stephen initially hoped to raise £1 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust but donations have rocketed past the £3 million mark this afternoon . Today Stephen's former headmaster at Chase Terrace Technology College, in Burntwood, described him as 'an exceptional lad'. Stuart . Jones told MailOnline that Stephen was an 'exceptional student' who . achieved straight As in his GCSEs and AS-levels and that he was expected . to get As in his A-levels but was unable to sit them. He . explained that Stephen had an interview at the University of Cambridge . and that he had planned to read medicine at university. He said Stephen was also a talented drummer and cross country runner while at school. He . said: ‘He is a remarkable young man. He’s all the things you’d want . someone to be – he’s very emotionally intelligent and supportive of . others. 'He is very able in many things but has no hint of arrogance or complacency. 'He has a really quick sense of humour and he is incredibly quick thinking. He really is an exceptional lad.’ Last night comedian Jason Manford held a last minute gig to raise money for Stephen's fund. The gig sold out in just four minutes . Stephen (pictured with comedian Jimmy Carr) received the letters of support despite many just being addressed to 'Stephen Sutton, Burntwood, England' It has emerged that Stephen has received messages of support from all over the world. He . has had letters from as far away as India which have arrived despite . being addressed simply to ‘Stephen Sutton, Burntwood, England’. The . teenager, who is in hospital with terminal colorectal cancer, has . inspired the world with his bid to raise money for the Teenager Cancer . Trust. A family friend said last night: ‘It is utterly unbelievable and shows how big this has become. ‘The letters have no address, no postcode, but they still find their way to Stephen. What's happening is hard to put into words. ‘This week has been a real roller coaster for Stephen's family and these messages have helped them tremendously.’ A . Royal Mail spokesman added: ‘Our postmen and women go the extra mile to . make sure the letters and parcels we handle get to the right person. ‘We're . proud to have been able to play a very small part in Stephen's . remarkable achievement by ensuring his family receive these important . letters.’ Stephen was admitted to hospital last Sunday after tumours caused his lung to collapse and he feared he only had days to live. Stephen has terminal colorectal cancer and last week it was believed he had just days left to live. He has now improved slightly and is able to breathe without help . He posted a message on Facebook asking people to help him reach his target of raising £1 million for the Teenage Cancer Trust – at the time he had raised about £500,000. His story rapidly went viral on the internet and donations started pouring in – he has now raised more than £3 million and is still fighting for his life. In the family's only interview, Stephen's elder brother Chris said: ‘I've struggled to get my head round the way people have reacted. ‘When I eventually do, my head will probably explode.’ Since his admission to hospital, Stephen’s condition has unexpectedly improved. Yesterday he informed his 454,000 Facebook followers that he was feeling ‘fantastic’ after ‘coughing up a tumour’. Stephen was diagnosed with cancer in 2010 when he was just 15. He had surgery to remove the tumour but it returned a year later and he was told that it was incurable . Stephen (pictured at 10 Downing Street) has been described by his headteacher as an 'exceptional lad' Stephen wrote: ‘This whole week has been pretty unbelievable and I can barely fully get my head round everything that has gone on. ‘After some visitors left I tried sitting up in a chair, but straight away asked the nurse to increase my oxygen levels as I was getting extremely short of breath. ‘I returned to my bed where I stabilised slightly for a while, but my breathing was still not right. ‘After lying there for a bit longer the coughing increased and suddenly the shortness of breath became incredibly severe. ‘I felt like I was like suffocating. ‘Then I forced out an oval red stained solid object through my mouth. Russell Brand has joined the Thumbs Up For Stephen campaign by posting a message of support on Twitter . ‘My breathing and airway straight away felt clearer, but I spent the next hour violently coughing and choking, but then eventually my breathing once again stabilised. ‘Since then, my breathing has dramatically improved. I'm really stuck for words to describe it. ‘This morning I am relying on NO external oxygen to breathe at all and I'm feeling bl**dy fantastic! ‘The doctors have discussed what's happened and the only plausible conclusion is that I've literally coughed up a tumour that was blocking my airway.’ Stephen added that an X-ray had revealed an improvement in his collapsed right lung. He said: ‘Physiologically a tumour breaking away like this is possible, but it all just seems incredibly surreal - mind, I'm not complaining! Olympic cyclist Sir Chris Hoy has also pledged his support for Stephen on Twitter . ‘My lungs are still pretty messy with other tumours, clots and potential infections and inflammations affecting my overall condition but, for now at least, I am in a good stable state. ‘I have no immediate problems and, in fact, feel better than I did when I first came into hospital last Sunday! ‘It's still a case of taking each day as it comes, but at the moment the days just keep on coming!’ His 21-year-old brother, Chris, added: ‘Stephen is improving all the time. His body seems to have become used to functioning on one lung. ‘On Monday he looked dreadful and there were worries he may not last the night, but he's made a miraculous fight back.’ Comedian Jason Manford last night staged a fundraising gig at his Birmingham comedy club in aid of the teenager's cause. Olympic swimmer Rebecca Adlington has also expressed support for Stephen on Twitter . The event sold out in four minutes, prompting Mr Manford to joke: ‘I wish all my gigs were like that. I might have to get him [Stephen] to do my PR.’ Mr Manford visited Stephen at Birmingham's Queen Elizabeth Hospital on Thursday. The star told LBC radio: ‘He is amazing. Even in bed with tubes and masks, with nurses coming in every 20 minutes to give him medicine, he was still talking about doing a sky dive and hoping to get in the Guinness Book of Records and different things on his bucket list. ‘He was talking about putting the fun into fundraising.’ Celebrities including Stephen Fry, Russell Brand, Clare Balding, Rebecca Adlington, Sir Chris Hoy and Piers Morgan have backed Stephen's fundraising efforts, and music mogul Simon Cowell pledged to make a ‘significant donation’.

"In a terrifying radio exchange just before landing a massive 235 ft cargo plane at the wrong, and tiny, Kansas airport late on Wednesday, the pilot sounded confused. The man could be heard mixing up east and . west, saying he could not read his own handwriting . and getting distracted from the conversation by 'looking at something . else.' Moments after touching down, when puzzled controllers told the pilot that he was 9 miles north of his intended destination, he made an unusual admission. 'Uh, yes sir, we just landed at the other airport.' Scroll down for video . On its way: The Dreamlifter was cheered on by crowds as it finally cleared the tiny runway at Jabara and made its way to McConnell, nine miles away . Lift off: The plane puts some distance between it and the runway as the pilot successfully navigates the huge jet off the tiny Kansas runway after mistakenly landing the day before . Wrong airport: The plane landed at Jabara when it was bound for McConnell. There are three airports in close proximity, including Beech, which is believed to have caused the pilot confusion . His calm, understated response belied the danger of the situation: The mammoth, Dreamlifter aircraft had just landed on the wrong stretch of concrete, miles from its planned path, in the dark. The runway just happened to be long enough to land. Fortunately the plane took off without incident on Thursday and landed at its intended destination. The Boeing 747, flown by a two-person crew with no passengers, intended to touch down late Wednesday at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita. It it was supposed to deliver parts for Boeing's new 787 Dreamliner to a nearby company that makes large sections of the next-generation jet. Belly of the beast: Boeing employees wait to unload the super freighter 'Dreamlifter' aircraft. The tail of the specially designed 747 freighter swings open for huge payloads that are unloaded using one of the largest cargo loaders in the world . Media interest: TV crews at the tiny airfield in Kansas where the huge plane got stranded overnight . Instead, the cargo plane landed to the north, at the smaller Col. James Jabara Airport. The jet took off again Thursday and within minutes landed at its original destination. The crew had flown into an area where there are three airports with similar runway configurations: the Air Force base, the Jabara airfield and a third facility in between called Beech Airport. That could help explain the mistake. Pilots also say it can be tough to tell a long runway from a shorter one on final approach. And Jabara is directly on the path toward McConnell, so the only difference would be that a pilot on final approach would reach it a little sooner. While it is rare for a pilot to land at the wrong airport, occasional confusion is not unusual. Every month or two, a pilot headed toward Wichita's Mid-Continent Airport begins to turn toward McConnell by mistake, said Brent Spencer, a former air traffic controller in Wichita who is now an assistant professor at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University in Prescott, Ariz. Attention attractor: People flocked to see the huge jet and Boeing had to dispatch a tug to turn the jet around . Mammoth: The super freighter Dreamlifter aircraft, carrying the massive wings for the first ever Boeing 787 Dreamliner, is towed into position in May 2007 in this file photo . Mid-Continent and McConnell 'have an almost identical runway setup, so it was not at all uncommon for an airliner or someone coming in from the east ... to pick up the wrong runway lights,' he said. It happened often enough that 'we would always watch for that, and we could always correct the pilot.' Jabara's 6,100-foot runway is toward the low end of what Boeing recommends for the 747. How much runway the plane needs varies depending on weather, the weight of the loaded plane and the airport's elevation. Boeing Co. owns the plane involved in the mistaken landing, but it's operated by Atlas Air Worldwide Holdings, a New York-based company that provides crews or planes to companies. An Atlas Air spokeswoman declined to answer questions and referred inquiries to Boeing. Boeing spokesman Doug Alder said the company would be consulting with Atlas to 'find out exactly what happened so that it doesn't happen again.' The Federal Aviation Administration planned to investigate whether the pilot followed controllers' instructions or violated any regulations. Squeeze: Jabara's 6,100-foot runway is toward the low end of what Boeing recommends for the 747 . After the pilot concluded he had landed at the wrong airport, the crew and controllers tried to figure out where the plane was. At one point, a controller read to the pilot the coordinates where he saw the plane on radar. When the pilot read the coordinates back, he mixed up east and west. 'Sorry about that, couldn't read my handwriting,' the pilot said on a recording provided by LiveATC.net. A few moments later, the pilot asked how many airports there are to the south of McConnell. But the other airports are both north of McConnell. 'I'm sorry, I meant north,' the pilot said when corrected. 'I'm sorry. I'm looking at something else.' They finally agreed on where the plane was after the pilot reported that a smaller plane, visible on the radar of air traffic control, had just flown overhead. The modified 747 is one of a fleet of four that hauls parts around the world to make the Dreamliner. Known as the 'Dreamlifter,' it features an expanded body to carry whole fuselage sections and other large parts. If a regular 747 with its bulbous double-decker nose looks like a snake, the overstuffed Dreamlifter looks like a snake that swallowed a rat. Surprise! The Boeing 747, flown by a two-person crew, intended to touch down late Wednesday at McConnell Air Force Base in Wichita. According to flight-tracking service FlightAware, this particular Dreamlifter has been shuttling between Kansas and Italy, where the center fuselage section and part of the tail of the 787 are made. Spirit AeroSystems, which is next to McConnell, completes the sections and sends them to Boeing plants in Washington state and South Carolina for assembly into finished jets. Almost a decade ago, a Northwest Airlines plane bound for Rapid City, S.D., with 117 passengers landed instead at nearby Ellsworth Air Force Base. As the plane descended through clouds, one of the pilots reported, the crew saw a runway in front of them and mistakenly thought it was the right one. Last year, a cargo plane bound for MacDill Air Force base in Tampa, Fla., landed without incident at the small Peter O. Knight Airport nearby. An investigation blamed confusion identifying airports in the area, and base officials introduced an updated landing procedure.","Pilot who landed huge cargo jet at wrong airport 9 miles north of intended destination in Kansas sounded confused on radio before landing .

"President Barack Obama is getting off the island. In a rare move for him, the president planned a break in the middle of his Martha's Vineyard vacation to return to Washington on Sunday night for meetings with Vice President Joe Biden and other advisers on the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and tensions between police and protesters in Ferguson, Missouri. The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington for those discussions. He's received multiple briefings on both issues while on vacation. The White House had also already announced Obama's plans to return to Washington before the U.S. airstrikes in Iraq began and before the shooting of a teen in Ferguson that sparked protests. Protective gesture: Obama walks with daughter Malia Obama to board Air Force One at Cape Cod Coast Guard Air Station in Massachusetts on Sunday . Back home: Obama and Malia are seen at Joint Base Andrews in Washington early Monday . Mysterious: The White House has been cagey about why the president needs to be back in Washington. He is seen here on the South Lawn of the White House with daughter Malia . In good spirits: Despite the early return, The President and First Daughter seemed to be enjoying a joke . Part of the decision to head back to Washington appears aimed at countering criticism that Obama is spending two weeks on a resort island in the midst of so many foreign and domestic crises. Yet those crises turned the first week of Obama's vacation into a working holiday. He made on-camera statements Iraq and the clashes in Ferguson, a St. Louis suburb. He also called foreign leaders to discuss the tensions between Ukraine and Russia, as well as between Israel and Hamas. 'I think it's fair to say there are, of course, ongoing complicated situations in the world, and that's why you've seen the president stay engaged,' White House spokesman Eric Schultz said. Obama returned from his break along with his 16-year-old daughter Mailia, but is scheduled to return to Martha's Vineyard on Tuesday and stay through next weekend. In a first for Obama family summer vacations, neither teenager is spending the entire holiday with her father. Obama left Washington Aug. 9 with his wife, Michelle, daughter Malia, and the family's two Portuguese water dogs. The White House said 13-year-old Sasha would join her parents at a later date for ""part of their stay"" on this quaint island of shingled homes. But Malia will not be around when her younger sister arrives. The daughters essentially are trading places, and the vacation is boiling down to Obama getting about a week with each one. Malia returned to Washington with her father  and is not expected to go back to Martha's Vineyard. The White House said Sasha will join her parents this week, without saying when she will arrive or what kept her away last week, or why Malia left the island. President Barack Obama bike rides with daughter Malia Obama while on vacation with his family on the island of Martha's Vineyard . Obama often draws chuckles from sympathetic parents who understand his complaints about his girls' lack of interest in spending time with him. 'What I'm discovering is that each year, I get more excited about spending time with them. They get a little less excited,' Obama told CNN last year. Even though work has occupied much of Obama's first week on vacation, he still found plenty of time to golf, go to the beach with his family and go out to dinner on the island. He hit the golf course one more time Sunday ahead of his departure, joining two aides and former NBA player Alonzo Mourning for an afternoon round. He then joined wife Michelle for an evening jazz performance featuring singer Rachelle Ferrell. Obama's vacation has also been infused with a dose of politics. He headlined a fundraiser on the island for Democratic Senate candidates and attended a birthday party for Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan's wife, where he spent time with former President Bill Clinton and Hillary Rodham Clinton. That get-together between the former rivals-turned-partners added another complicated dynamic to Obama's vacation. Just as Obama was arriving on Martha's Vineyard, an interview with the former secretary of state was published in which she levied some of her sharpest criticism of Obama's foreign policy. Clinton later promised she and Obama would 'hug it out' when they saw each other at Jordan's party. No reporters were allowed in, so it's not clear whether there was any hugging, but the White House said the president danced to nearly every song.","President Obama will head back to the White House on Sunday night as tensions rise in Missouri and Iraq .

"Hustler: Bronx beggar Eddie Wise, 51, was found dead in his apartment by his wife in January . The self-professed 'original hustler' who became New York City's most famous beggar when he sued NYPD to defend his right to peacefully panhandle has died. Eddie Wise's wife Sharon Persaud found him dead, by himself and bleeding from the nose, in January in the East 158th St basement they shared. A medical examiner said the . 51-year-old died of a brain-stem hemorrhage caused by acute cocaine . intoxication and hypertensive cardiovascular disease. 'Eddie was a good man,' widow Persaud, 37, told the New York Post. 'He worked hard; he was always cheerful. A lot of people didn’t give him a chance. 'This time, he wanted a better life. 'We planned on leaving New York and buying a house. We had high hopes, but they never came through.' Wise . was the lead plaintiff in a 2005 class action accusing the NYPD of . arresting thousands of people across the state under an anti-panhandling . law ruled unconstitutional in 1992, the Daily News reported.

In December 2006, the city agreed to pay Wise $100,000 if he dropped his complaint.

While Wise was instrumental in driving the city's largest legal payout, he failed to make the most of his own share. The New York Post reports the Harlem-born man was penniless when he died, squandering most of his fortune on drugs. 'Everybody in the neighborhood is thinking that . . . I’m going to be broke pretty soon,” Wise, then 45, told New York magazine in 2007. 'I got to prove to myself that I know how to handle this money. One hundred thousand dollars ain’t no joke.' Panhandling: Eddie Wise was the lead plaintiff in a 2005 class action accusing the NYPD of arresting numerous people across the state under an anti-panhandling law ruled unconstitutional in 1992 . He went back to hustling shortly after his cash windfall, allegedly wasting many other opportunities to build a new life. He reportedly began using cocaine after being discharged from the National Guard for a heart murmur shortly after graduating. He was a deliveryman in the 1990s and scored a settlement of tens of thousands after injuring his hand, but blew it on cocaine. Wise was arrested at least 52 times, on charges that included felony crack possession, violating an order of protection and assaulting a woman. Wise left behind 3-year-old daughter Montice and son Cody, born last month. He also had a 16-year-old son with another woman, who said Wise disappeared after the settlement, according to the New York Post.","Bronx bum Eddie Wise, 51, who won $100K by suing the city's police for jailing him under unconstitutional anti-panhandling laws has died.

"US counter-terrorism officials are involved in a frantic search for a friend of the Boston Bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev after she failed to return from Chechnya last year and has now posted 'alarming' pictures online of women in head-scarfs dressed as jihadi soldiers. Terrorist experts have become concerned that Heda Umarova, 23, may have become radicalized to commit Islamist violence and poses a threat to Americans at home and abroad because her US passport allows her relatively easy foreign travel. The pretty Chelsea, Massachusetts student first came to the attention of authorities when she began to spout the false-flag attack conspiracy theories of radio host Alex Jones in the aftermath of her friend Dzhokhar's dramatic capture in April. Worry: Heda Umarova (left) is pictured here with her friend and suspected Boston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in a social media posting uploaded to Umarova's Russian social network page known as VK . Jones, who broadcasts 17-hours a week online, claims that the US government planned and perpetrated the April 15 marathon attacks which killed three and injured more than 260 in Boston. Part of the small minority who are sympathetic to the younger Tsarnaev, Umarova has been quoted by Bloomberg News as saying, 'A lot of it is ‘Oh my god, he is crazy,’ but a lot of stuff he says make sense. 'He brings up a lot of valid points.' Her two younger brothers, Adam, 20 and Junes, 18, are already under suspicion by authorities because of their strong online backing and friendship with Dzhokhar that included posting pictures of themselves lighting fireworks with him two months before the attacks. Frightening: These are the images of women jihadists in Chechnya posted to the Russian VK social networking site of Heda Umarova that have greatly concerned the FBI and counter-terrorism officials . Friends and brothers: Adam Umarov, 20, (left) is friends with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev as is his brother Junes, 18, (right) - who posted the Boston bombing suspect messages of support in the aftermath of the terror atrocity in April . Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being held at Massachusetts federal prison Fort Devens and recently the Department of Justice has announced prosecutors will seek the death penalty for his part in the terror atrocity which killed three people and injured more than 260 people . Heda Umarova is known to have traveled with her family to her native Chechnya in July, but failed to return home with her parents to Massachusetts in August. Her parents, Raisa and Hamzat told US authorities that she remained behind to marry after meeting a man in Chechnya during Ramadan. Friends: This image shared online by Junes Umarov shows him and Boston bombing suspect Dzhokhar Tsarnaev playing with fireworks in Boston before the April 2013 terror attacks . Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev became highly radicalized in the lead up to the April Boston attacks, espousing independence for Dagestan from Russia - which borders Chechnya and is a predominantly Muslim nation. 'No one is calling Heda a terrorist but her travel has certainly garnered some attention. People are concerned that a 23-year-old is in Chechnya, a country that she fled from... and now she is deciding to stay on her own,' a law enforcement source involved in the Boston Marathon investigation told ABC News. They also told ABC that they had become worried because prior to the marriage, the 23-year-old had no 'obvious means' of financial support. 'We were already concerned about the social media exchanged with her brothers, who remain on the radar, especially the younger brother Junes, who was Dzhokhar's best friend,' the source added. However, recent developments on Heda's Russian social media site VK.Com have begun to worry FBI officials. She . has been posting pictures of Chechen jihadis with guns and a . photo-shopped image of a US passport in a carry-on bag featuring the . black flag that signifies joining jihad. Social media support: This post from Junes Umarov is one of many that alerted authorities to his continued support for his friend who is accused of carrying out the terror attack on the Boston marathon in April . Father: Hamzat Umarov has categorically denied that any of his children are involved in Islamic extremism and dismissed pictures his daughter Heda is believed to have posted online that show jihadi soldiers brandishing weapons . Heda and her brothers did not respond to ABC News when they attempted to contact them. Her father, Hamzat Umarov was dismissive of any suggestions that just because photographs have been posted online, it means his daughter has been radicalized. 'What does it mean, pictures? Pictures can be anywhere. It doesn't mean anything, the pictures. We don't want to talk about it. We talk with the FBI, everybody. The FBI came, CIA, everybody's come,' he said to ABC News. Indeed, in the aftermath of his daughter uploading the photographs of jihadists, Hamzat Umarov's Chelsea, Massachusetts home was raided by armed agents - just as the apartment was in April last year as authorities searched Boston for Dzhokhar. Rebel fighter fighters in the Caucasus: Heda Umarova is believed to have uploaded pictures of female jihadi's onto her Russian social networking site VK . Authorities have made it very clear to the family that Heda Umarova has not been indicted for any offences. The agents who conducted the raid questioned the Umarov family as to why they returned to Chechnya when they fled ten years ago. 'They had a hard time getting out of the country and an even harder time coming back when she was not with them,' said a law enforcement official familiar with the Umarov family. The strong line of questioning led to Heda's sister, Hawa Umarova, 26, complaining to U.S. Customs and Border Protection and Boston Joint Terrorism Task Force officials that her family was made to feel like 'terrorists'. Authorities were first led to the Umarov family after they discovered Twitter messages that had been exchanged between Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Junes Umarov the day before the twin blasts along the finishing line of the marathon. Suspects: Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev walk around the finishing line of the Boston marathon on April 15 . In addition to the social media exchanges between the Tsarnaev and his best friend Junes, authorities are also examining the Russian social network page VK that has the name Heda Umarova and links to a fan page for Dzhokhar. The page which is sympathetic to the . 20-year-old bomber insists he is innocent and features several pictures . of the Umarov siblings with Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, including one with Heda, . her brother Adam, and 'Johar' as a boy, which is the Russian spelling of . the accused terrorist's nickname. Upset: MCLA student Hawa Umarova made a complaint to authorities after her family was questioned about their links to Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and his brother Tamerlan . However, . authorities do admit that the pictures of Chechen women dressed as . jihadi fighters in Chechnya are probably ten years old. In one photo, a woman in a black headscarf is toting an AK-47 rifle. ABC News discovered that the images had all been removed days after they spoke to the Umarov family. The . Heda Umarova VK page also links to the Kavkaz Center, which is heavily . associated with Doku Umarov, the jihadi leader of the Caucusus Emirate . who threatened to strike the Sochi Olympics last July. There is no relation between the Umarov family in question and the terror leader. When . interviewing their mother Raisa last week, ABC News described her . becoming emotional when asked why her daughter had returned to Chechnya, . especially after she fled the war-torn nation with her husband ten . years ago. 'She is . getting married. She doesn't speak good Russian. They [the Umarov . children] come to this country as babies. This is my home now. I love . this country. I love my children being here,' the mother said through . tears to ABC News. Raisa Umarova made it clear that she loves the United States and is a proud citizen. According . to law enforcement officers, the Umarovs and the Tsarnaevs became . friendly and father, Hamzat, acknowledged that the families 'knew each . other'. Terror: Runners continue to run towards the finish line of the Boston Marathon as an explosion erupts near the finish line of the race . However, Raisa Umarova was unequivocal in her opinion of the Tsarnaev family when she told ABC News, 'I don't like them. I like my country.' Not one member of the Umarov family has been charged with a crime or named as a suspect in connection with the April 15 attack on the Boston Marathon. All five of the Umarov children attended Chelsea High School and Principal Joseph Mullaney said that they were all 'bright students'. Junes and Adam were enrolled in Advanced Placement classes, and like their older sister Hawa, could speak several languages. Hawa graduated from Mass College of Liberal Arts in June and Junes and Adam are roommates and students at MCLA now. Tragic day: Two explosions went off near the finish line of the 117th Boston Marathon on April 15, 2013 killing three and injuring more than 260 people . Chelsea High School librarian Thelma Dakubu said the entire Umarov family were proud of their Chechen heritage. 'They were fond of saying, 'We're not Russian. We're Chechen,' Dakubu told ABC News. 'Heda was the quiet one.' However, in his 2013 high school yearbook, Junes Umarov wrote, 'I'm a stress free kind of guy' -- which is the identical quote Dzhokhar Tsarnaev tweeted two days after the bombings as law enforcement staggered to find them. Rasia and Hamzat confirmed separately that their daughter is married but would not say when, where or where. Dzhokhar Tsarnaev is being held at Massachusetts federal prison Fort Devens and recently the Department of Justice has announced prosecutors will seek the death penalty. U.S. District Court Judge George A. O'Toole ruled last month that the trial is slated to begin in November.","Law enforcement have become increasingly concerned for the whereabouts of 23-year-old Boston student Heda Umarova .

"There have been a lot of ups and downs in the 50-year history of the programme, but few TV shows have held the same appeal as Match of the Day over the years. After Kenneth Wolstenholme left, I was lucky enough to get my chance and the thing that put me on the map was the FA Cup third round replay between Hereford and Newcastle.

So Barry Davies and I would track the action with words and then a replay would be added after Grandstand. The other big change has been the logistics. We went from preparing for teams of 11 players with one sub to full squads of 18.

After around 1,500 games of commentary, it’s hard to pick out favourite ones — but there were always special players to cover. In the Premier League it was Thierry Henry, Eric Cantona and Cristiano Ronaldo, and before that people like Paul Gascoigne. The one game that does stick out was England’s 5-1 win in Germany and if you pushed me for a goal it would be David Beckham’s from the halfway line against Wimbledon. I was shocked by the sheer audacity of it and I got a very good view!","Motson's first game was famous cup tie between Hereford and Newcastle .

"True to form, the celebrity lawyer known in legal circles as the 'Diva of Divorce' is not letting a little thing such as being laid up in hospital get in the way of extracting every last penny for her wealthy clients. Ayesha Vardag has spent this week firing off emails and fielding calls on her mobile phone from her bed in the swanky Lister Hospital in Chelsea. So what exactly has laid her low? A tummy-tuck operation, she tells me cheerfully between visits from her nurses in her well-appointed private room. Rivals: Celebrity divorce lawyers Ayesha Vardag (left) and Raymond Tooth, pictured out in Mayfair, central London, are involved in a court battle . Such cosmetic tweaks, the glamorous 45-year-old Miss Vardag points out, are vital if she is to impress her well-off, mainly female, clients. 'And I do a lot of television,' she adds. 'It's all to do with public image.' Likewise, she says she wouldn't be seen dead without her vast wardrobe of Dior, Chanel and Donna Karan business suits. And she arrives for meetings at the wheel of a red, open-top classic Mercedes 280SL. 'It's a 1984 model,' she explains. 'I grew up watching Dallas and Pamela Ewing drove one exactly like it. It's the epitome of glamour.' Suffice to say, the colourful Miss Vardag, who runs her own £10 million-a-year legal firm, is not your average divorce lawyer. No wonder she's causing ructions in the cloistered world of London's top matrimonial solicitors. Not least because she's gone into battle with the most formidable of adversaries: her former mentor and rival for the role of Britain's top celebrity divorce specialist, Raymond Tooth. Cigar-chomping lawyer Raymond Tooth with Fiona Shackleton leaving a restaurant in Mayfair, central London . Nicknamed 'Jaws' because of his fearsome reputation, he's won millions for clients who have included Jude Law's ex Sadie Frost, Cheryl Barrymore and Roman Abramovich's former wife, Irina, who he advised during her £1.2 billion split from the Chelsea FC oligarch. Cigar-chomping Mr Tooth isn't a man you'd want to be on the wrong side of. Yet it's been reported that Miss Vardag has been caught red-handed trying to steal rich and famous clients from under his nose. And it's caused Tooth — who has, until now, always insisted on keeping a low profile — to come out fighting. 'It's a very poor show, I'm afraid,' an angry Tooth told me this week. 'I think it's so underhand, particularly as I helped her in her career — talk about biting the hand that fed you.' The row has erupted over claims the law firm Miss Vardag owns hijacked the website of Tooth's Mayfair-based partnership Sears Tooth. Her firm, Vardags, paid for an advertisement on the website Google AdWords which meant anyone using Google to search for Tooth's company was led to a 'puff' for his rival's operation. Legal eagle: Glamorous lawyer Ayesha Vardag appearing on ITV show This Morning . Under the logo of Tooth's firm, the advert boasted: 'Vardags is a world-renowned, top family law firm, dealing with many high-profile cases; from celebrities and foreign royals to high net-worth and international individuals.' Much worse, as far as 73-year-old Tooth is concerned, it implied that he was past it and that Miss Vardag was his heir apparent. The promotional spiel continued: 'Sharing elements of Ray Tooth's flamboyant and forceful style, Ayesha Vardag has been described by senior members of the profession as the modern successor to the family law “crown”, which Tooth wore through the Eighties and Nineties.' 'Vardags', it added, 'have had a number of clients transfer to them from Sears Tooth.' No wonder Mr Tooth is incandescent. Miss Vardag claims the whole thing has been a misunderstanding caused by an over-zealous advertising agent. But Tooth insists it's a case of dirty tricks orchestrated by his ambitious former underling. In response, he hired lawyer Niri Shan of City firm Taylor Wessing to have the advert removed. Now Vardags have settled the case out of court by agreeing to pay £5,000 in damages and another £38,000 in costs. They've also had to promise not to do it again, although they deny liability. The row has highlighted a major clash of styles. While the ageing Mr Tooth avoids the limelight, meeting his famous clients late at night to keep their identities secret, the thrusting Miss Vardag boasts openly about her court successes and is a regular face on television, including ITV's This Morning. Despite the settlement, Tooth does not seem inclined to let bygones be bygones. 'It was an absolutely naked attempt to get our business,' he told me this week. 'I do not accept that Ayesha Vardag somehow excuses herself and her firm from what happened. 'This whole argument has been about someone behaving in a way where they pinch another person's clients in the most unscrupulous way. And to suggest she didn't know about it is nonsense.' But Miss Vardag was quick to hit back. In a pointed dig at her former mentor, she insisted: 'We've had most of the high-profile divorces of the past year, so we've got enough to keep us busy without Ray's clients as well. It's always difficult for our competitors when we expand our market share. We've got a very modern way of doing things.' The fall-out comes as the battle to land Britain's biggest divorce cases turns increasingly hostile. Newcomer Miss Vardag, the daughter of a single mother, won a place at Cambridge and qualified as a barrister before launching her own firm in 2005. The divorced mother-of-three divides her time between a rented £7 million Queen Anne-style mansion next door to Winchester Cathedral, a £1.7 million Georgian house she owns in Islington and a stylish farmhouse in southern Italy. Ayesha Vardag made her name acting for Katrin Radamacher who sued her estranged husband Nicholas Granatino over the enforcability of a pre-nuptual marriage agreement . She made her name acting for Katrin Radmacher, the German heiress who won a landmark case in the Supreme Court in 2010 which ruled a pre-nup to protect her £100 million fortune from her French-born ex-husband was legally binding. She currently represents former Miss Malaysia Pauline Chai, who is seeking £500 million in her divorce from her Laura Ashley-owner husband Khoo Kay Peng. Against Miss Vardag is the equally flamboyant Tooth, who, like his protegee, charges a reported £500-an-hour. In 2005, after his divorce from second wife Debbie, he bought a £5 million townhouse in Chelsea. Meanwhile, he's known for being driven around town in a £220,000 navy-blue German-built Maybach limousine, which comes with its own Champagne-stocked bar. His reputation for being ruthless has brought the Oxford-educated lawyer a host of rich clients. He won £4 million for Sadie Frost in her divorce from Jude Law, plus a £2 million house and £15,000-a-month maintenance. He also helped Eimear Montgomerie walk away from her marriage to golfer Colin with £15 million. Court battles: Russian businessman Roman Abramovich and his wife Irina before their split (left) and (right) British actor Jude Law and his wife Sadie Frost . Ironically, Tooth also represented Miss Vardag in her 2000 divorce from fellow lawyer Xavier Hunter, with whom she has two sons Jasper, 18, and Felix, 17 (she also has a daughter Helena, 11, from a later, failed relationship). But despite his low public profile, Mr Tooth has been touched by controversy on occasion. In 2011, Stacey Van Rossum, a former filing clerk at his firm took him to an industrial tribunal claiming that when he found out she was pregnant, he offered to 'kick the baby out of her stomach'. The lawyer, who denied Ms Van Rossum's claims, did admit asking her to scratch his back. Miss Van Rossum lost the case when it was ruled that she had quit Sears Tooth before she was fired. Meanwhile, Pattie Boyd wrote in her 2007 memoirs that she decided not to hire Mr Tooth for her divorce from Eric Clapton after visiting the lawyer at his office. She said he 'frightened me so much I thought he was going to have Eric assassinated!' Former commercial lawyer Miss Vardag joined Tooth Sears in 2001 but left the following year after falling pregnant with her daughter. Nine years after launching her own firm from a room in her North London home, she employs 50 lawyers and says her firm has had a 300-400 per cent growth rate in recent years. But Mr Tooth scoffs at her claims that she's secured the majority of big-money clients from under the nose of his firm in recent years. 'It's complete nonsense,' he says. 'Ayesha's a self-confessed publicist. I'm not here to empire-build. I have managed to keep confidential most of my well-known clients because I make a big effort to ensure it doesn't get out. 'Part of Vardags' ethos is to get clients publicity, not realising that the judges do not like it and it hurts their case. But it's all part of her own publicity campaign. 'I don't have personal ill-will, with the exception that I think what she did [with the website] was really underhand.' However, Miss Vardag is not overly repentant. 'It's one of those unfortunate things,' she says. 'An ad went out without my authority and as soon as we learnt about it, we got it taken down. 'I'm really looking forward to locking horns with Ray again, but only for our clients in the future.' For the time being, however, who'd be brave enough to take bets on who'll come out on top?","Ayesha Vardag has gone into battle with divorce specialist Raymond Tooth .

"A 'glowing' statue of the Virgin Mary has brought hundreds of pilgrims flocking to a house in a small town in southern Belgium. Police in Jalhay have been forced to post guards around a pavilion erected by the retired owners of what is being referred to as 'the mysterious glowing Virgin'. On one day this week alone 500 people visited the house in the normally quiet town to see the statue, which witnesses claim emits a dull glow in the dark. Mystery solved: Scientists found that the statue was covered in paint containing zinc sulphide which made it glow . But local Catholic authorities, who . have sent clergymen to investigate, remain cautious about claiming for . definite whether there is a natural or religious explanation for the . statue's luminescence. The . phenomenon was first noticed in the middle of January and has gradually . attracted growing crowds. Local media report that some of those visiting . the statue claim to have been cured of ailments. Pilgrims: Over 500 people came to the house in Jalhay, Belgium, in one day this month . The . statue, which is about a foot high, represents the 'Virgin of Banneux', . from the name of a nearby village where a young girl was said to have . witnessed an appearance by the Virgin in 1933. The . town has since become a pilgrim destination in largely Catholic . Belgium, although Catholic authorities from the Banneux sanctuary are . expressing caution about the 'glowing' Virgin. 'It's certain that something is going on but I can't tell you whether there is a natural or a miraculous explanation,' said Father Leo Palm, who was sent to investigate the statue by the bishop of Liege. The owners of the statue have refused to allow it to be removed for further examination, saying 'she is fine where she is'.","500 visitors came to the 'mysterious glowing Virgin' in one day this week .

"A father battling cancer claims cannabis helped cure him of the disease. Trevor Smith, 54, was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2012. Doctors told him that without immediate surgery to remove his bladder, prostate and lymph nodes - followed by chemotherapy - he would be dead within two years. But worried about his quality of life after such radical surgery, he decided to try alternative therapies - and began taking cannabis oil after learning about it online. Scroll down for video . Trevor Smith, 54 (with wife Carol) was diagnosed with bladder cancer in 2012. Doctors told him that without immediate surgery  and chemotherapy, he would be dead within two years . But worried about his quality of life after such radical surgery, he decided to try alternative therapies - and began taking cannabis oil after learning about it online . He claims that 10 weeks later, despite . doctors' warnings about delaying treatment, the cancer had not spread to . any other organs. This meant it could be lasered away in a far less invasive procedure - and he the father-of-three has now been cancer-free for a year. Mr Smith, who works as a manager in the oil and gas industry, said: 'It felt like I was going into the unknown, but the cannabis oil changed things for the better. 'When doctors told me I had gone into remission, I was lost for words, I almost couldn’t believe it.' 'I feel indebted to the oil and its . medical properties, there are alternatives to chemotherapy but people . just need to open their eyes to it.' Scientific research does suggest that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in cannabis – possess anti-cancer properties which help stem the growth of malignant tumours. And Cancer Research UK is currently funding clinical trials using the drug. Mr Smith's wife Carol, 55, said: 'So many thoughts rushed through my mind all at once when Trevor was diagnosed. All I could envisage was I was going to lose the love of my life. 'We knew we had to try a different approach to save his life.' While a healthy diet and alternative medicines, such as Essiac tea and vitamin supplements, were successful in improving Mr Smith’s overall health, he was still in excruciating pain as the cancer continued to spread. Mr Smith claims that 10 weeks later, despite doctors' warnings about delaying treatment, the cancer had not spread to any other organs . It was then that they resorted to using cannabis oil to treat his cancer - risking prison by possessing large quantities of the drug. The couple, from Derby, made the controversial decision after discovering a popular pro-cannabis film called ‘Run From The Cure’, which claimed the class B drug could be used as a cure. The couple got in contact with a legal manufacturer of cannabis oil in the USA, who agreed to supply Mr Smith with the drug. The couple arranged to pick up 60 grams of cannabinoid, an edible compound of the plant containing 65 per cent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) - the psychoactive compound in marijuana -in the UK. Research published last month by the University of East Anglia found THC has been shown to help combat . the growth of cancerous cells. Dr . Kat Arney, Cancer Research UK’s science communications manager, told . MailOnline: 'We know that cannabinoids – the active chemicals found in . cannabis – can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown . in the lab and animal tumours. 'But . at the moment there isn’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove . that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts. 'These . stories can help researchers build a picture of whether these . treatments are helping or not, although this is weak evidence compared . to properly-run clinical trials. 'Cancer . Research UK is supporting clinical trials for treating cancer with . cannabis extract and a synthetic cannabinoid In order to gather solid . data on how best these drugs can be used to benefit people with cancer.' Although doctors can prescribe the drug to named cancer patients to treat nausea and vomiting, the possession of cannabinoid is prohibited under UK law and can carry a prison sentence of up to five years. Mr Smith said: 'It wasn’t a case of I had no respect for the law, I was fighting to save my life. 'At that point, I would have risked everything to beat the cancer. 'These options have always been there, even in the UK, but the medical system has kept it from everyone. 'I never really gave it a second thought; I was in a race against time, so I had to roll the dice.' His wife, an artist, added: 'I would have done anything to give my husband the treatment he needed. 'Even if I was caught, what would they do? Send me to prison for trying to treat my dying husband? 'The only thing in my mind was saving my husband from chemo, radiation and radical surgery - not my freedom.' The couple, who have been married for 33 years, planned to carry out the treatment, which included feeding Mr Smith 60 grams of cannabis oil, over a period of ten weeks. The father-of-three, who had no previous experience of taking the drug, said: 'The effects were quite shocking.' His wife said: 'Initially, Trevor reacted very badly to the cannabis oil. 'Neither of us had ever used any recreational drugs, so we weren’t aware of the effects it had. 'At first, it made him very sleepy and non-responsive - both conversationally and physically. 'He would sleep for up to 12 hours at night. It was one of the hardest things we have ever gone through.' Mrs Smith has since written a book called  Taking Control: My Journey of Alternative Healing by Alyssia Sade. Research led by Dr Wai Liu, at St George’s University in London, suggests that cannabinoids possess anti-cancer properties which help to stem the growth of malignant tumours. Mr Smith said: 'I feel indebted to the oil and its medical properties, there are alternatives to chemotherapy but people just need to open their eyes to it' He said: 'Mechanistically, both THC and cannabinoids work by switching on cell killing processes that are found in cancer cells. 'The idea is that by switching these on, cell death can be engaged leading to reductions in tumours. 'Similarly, actions through these signalling cascades could actually make the cancer cells more sensitive to other forms of therapy - I suppose cannabinoids and THC could act by laying the foundations for other therapies to work more effectively.' Dr Kat Arney, science communications manager at Cancer Research UK, said: 'We know that cannabinoids can have a range of different effects on cancer cells grown in the lab and animal tumours. 'But at the moment there isn’t good evidence from clinical trials to prove that they can safely and effectively treat cancer in patients. 'Despite this, we are aware that some cancer patients do choose to treat themselves with cannabis extracts.

"Stuart Lancaster was given an extended contract until 2020 on Wednesday, then told that failure at next year’s World Cup will not be tolerated. While some questioned the wisdom of making such a long-term commitment to England’s head coach and his assistants, RFU chief executive Ian Ritchie was defiant. ‘We want to win the World Cup,’ he said. ‘We are trying to galvanise the England coaching team and do our best to win it. There will be a review at various stages and one of those will be after the World Cup. It will be a very simple review if we win it. Anything less than that, we’ll review afterwards. Stuart Lancaster will coach England beyond the World Cup in 2019 after being handed a contract extension . The RFU also handed contract extensions to England coaches Graham Rowntree, Andy Farrell and Mike Catt .

October 1 - Lancaster contract extended to 2020 by the RFU . ‘Then you get into that delight of what is and is not acceptable below that and what the criteria are, and I’d really rather not go into that.’ Lancaster said: ‘It’s great that the RFU have faith in us as a coaching group and their support has been critical to what we have achieved. While our focus is on the QBE international against New Zealand, and the 2015 World Cup on home soil, we want to build a team that leads into Japan in 2019 and beyond. ‘We believe England Rugby is moving in the right direction, we have the right coaching and management team to take us forward and are excited about the challenge ahead.’ Ritchie admitted that approving contract extensions for Lancaster, Andy Farrell, Graham Rowntree and Mike Catt at this juncture is a gamble. ‘Of course there are some elements of risk to it,’ he said. ‘But coaching at international level is unique in that the time Stuart and the coaches have with the players is limited and in that regard it requires a special and stable coaching team. ‘We therefore felt it important to secure their long-term future.’ One risk appears to be fudging Lancaster’s remit. While part of his brief is to plan for the medium to long term, as he does so adeptly, the bottom line is the quest for here-and-now victories. Ritchie said: ‘Of course it’s about results, but it would be short-term if you looked purely at results. You have to look at their contribution in a broader sense; the relationships the guys have with directors of rugby, Premier Rugby, with the community game. Results are extremely important, but there’s more to it than that.’ England coaches (from left to right) Rowntree, Catt, Lancaster and Farrell have been given new contracts . Matches won: 18 . Matches drawn: 1 . Matches lost: 11 . Win percentage: 60 . Points scored: 720 . Points conceded: 523 . Biggest win: . England 54-12 Fiji (Nov 2012) Worst loss: . New Zealand 36-13 England (Jun 2014) Best record: . 100 per cent records against Argentina, Fiji, Ireland, Italy and Scotland . Worst record: . Lancaster’s England have never beaten South Africa . Lancaster cannot afford to think the same. Despite the breathing space, he must see English success in this season’s Six Nations and next year’s World Cup as a necessity. There have been too many barren years. England are undoubtedly a rising force but whether they can climb fast enough to mount a convincing challenge next year remains to be seen. First, they must negotiate their way out of a proverbial ‘Group of Death’ containing Australia and Wales. Even if that is achieved, going through as runners-up would surely leave them in the path of South Africa, then the All Blacks, rather than on a less treacherous route to the final. No matter how difficult the terrain along the way, the world’s richest union have a right to expect a minimum return of a semi-final place in this country, while reaching the final should be a realistic objective. The doomsday scenario of a pool-stage exit would leave Ritchie and the RFU board facing fierce pressure to consider a management change. Ian Ritchie said RFU bosses acted swiftly to secure the long-term future of Lancaster and his coaching group . Ritchie spoke of various objectives: plotting a course for Japan 2019 while continuing the fine work of re-engaging with the rugby public. These are worthy targets, but they are more in tune with a wide-ranging director of rugby role. Lancaster is committed, resourceful and meticulous, but he should be left to focus on the approaching World Cup. In explaining the timing of this move, Ritchie said that the priority was to show ‘four very talented coaches’ that they are supported and valued, and to ward off potential suitors, should the World Cup reach a glorious conclusion. There is sense in that, as Rowntree was previously coveted by Wales head coach Warren Gatland and Farrell’s motivational qualities are admired far beyond these shores. But Lancaster and his assistants are immersed in the English system and their salvage operation after the 2011 World Cup debacle stems from a detailed knowledge of the domestic landscape that would not be an asset overseas. These patriotic men are unlikely to have their heads turned, aside from the prospect of a possible call-up by the Lions. They are doing a good job, but this is still a profound leap of faith by the RFU. ‘We have a belief that we are going to be successful,’ said Ritchie. He must hope this belief is well-founded to avoid the need for a grim post-mortem examination and regrets.

"Blackpool might be sitting bottom of the Sky Bet Championship table after just one win in 15 games but it seems the Seasiders have a secret weapon in their ranks. Teenager Dom Telford has only made a single first team appearance but has garnered a reputation for scoring wondergoals in the youth ranks - twice being nominated for the League Football Education's goal of the month, which included a 35-yard chip against Liverpool that was a contender for goal of the season. And, the 18-year-old has done it again with an outrageous solo goal in a youth team match against Padiham that saw him pick up the ball at the halfway line before gliding effortlessly past a succession of defenders and finishing with a rasping shot into the top corner.

"David Cameron has decided to send his daughter Nancy to a state secondary school as his wife is ‘very keen’ to give her children a ‘normal’ education, friends of the couple have claimed. Nancy Cameron is now ten years old and her parents will have to submit their choice of schools in November. Samantha Cameron is said to want her daughter to meet people outside their usual circle, claiming she wants her children to be judged ‘for who they are’ rather than being defined by their rarefied social status or their father’s job. David Cameron (pictured in 2007) has decided to send his daughter Nancy to a state secondary school as his wife is 'very keen' to give her children a 'normal' education, friends of the couple have claimed . One friend told the Mail: ‘She’s very keen on a normal education for her children. Her children’s lives are abnormal enough. They have a strange existence as it is. ‘Being in a state school is a nice antidote to that. You get to meet normal children from normal houses whose fathers don’t go off and spend the weekend with Angela Merkel. The children can be socially fluid.’ The Prime Minister has constantly had to battle sceptics who feel that his education at Eton College makes him ill-equipped to speak for ordinary voters. And Mrs Cameron is the daughter of Sir Reginald Sheffield – a landowner descended from Charles II. She attended the fee-paying Marlborough College in Wiltshire, where the Duchess of Cambridge was also educated. But her time studying fine arts at the University of the West of England in Bristol convinced Mrs Cameron that her children would benefit from exposure to people of different backgrounds. Her friend explained: ‘At Bristol she loved the fact that no one discussed which school they were from. It was all about what you were doing then and there. 'You were judged by who you were, not who your parents were or where you went to school.’ They added: ‘Sam’s very non-judgmental. She takes people at face value and makes up her own mind about people. Samantha Cameron is said to want her daughter to meet people outside their usual circle, claiming she wants her children to be judged 'for who they are' rather than being defined by their rarefied social status or their father's job . ‘She wants a school where people don’t make assumptions about you based on the frame of your life, as that stereotypes people in a way that is genuinely unfair.’ The decision means that Mr Cameron is set to become the first Conservative Prime Minister ever to entrust his children to the state sector while in Downing Street. Details of the couple’s thinking emerged a week after Education Secretary Michael Gove became the first Tory in that post to opt for state school for his daughter Beatrice, who won a place at Grey Coat Hospital School in Westminster. Beatrice Gove and Nancy Cameron, as well as her brother Elwen, currently attend one of London’s most sought-after state primary schools in Kensington. Mrs Cameron, 42, is expected to visit Grey Coats but friends say the school might be too close to Westminster for Mrs Cameron’s taste. Other options are thought to include St Marylebone School in central London and Lady Margaret School in Parsons Green, west London. Holland Park School – one of the first comprehensives in the UK – is also an option, although it is more usually associated with Labour grandees like Tony Benn. Sources say the Prime Minister was ‘very behind’ sending his children to a state primary school and the couple are ‘now working towards’ choosing a state secondary school for Nancy. His allies say there is ‘no reason’ why they won’t make the same choice for their son Elwen, now eight. Downing Street declined to comment but a source said: ‘The decision is still some way off. Nothing has changed since the answer the Prime Minister gave in November 2012.’ On that occasion, Mr Cameron said: ‘I would like my children to go to state schools, that’s my intention, and I think what’s happening in the state school system is really exciting. ‘What we’re seeing is something we should have seen years ago which is the flowering of more choice, more competition, more diversity and crucially higher standards. I want my children to be part of that and I’m very heartened by what is happening.’","Samantha Cameron wants daughter to meet people outside usual circle .

"With a Taliban fighter looming in his sights half a mile away, the British sniper knew a clean shot would take down his enemy. What he could not have known was that the single bullet he fired would account for five more insurgents. But, incredibly, his rifle round triggered the explosive vest worn by his target, killing all those around him. Deadly: How the lance corporal from the Coldstream Guards took down six insurgents with a single shot . Lt Col Richard Slack (centre), Commander of the 9/12th Royal Lancers, and Col John Mead (right) take a last look at the frontline of the Helmand river outside Sterga 2 Observation Post .

The record-breaking shot was fired by a Coldstream Guards marksman on one of the last missions to be carried out by British troops in Afghanistan. UK forces are preparing to leave their last frontline base in Helmand as part of their withdrawal from Afghanistan. The sniper, a lance corporal who cannot be named for security reasons, was on a mission to intercept a suspected suicide bomber. Commanders feared the insurgent was planning to blow himself up at either a UK base, an Afghan security checkpoint or a civilian target such as a school or government building. Down time: The isolated Sterga base is manned by soldiers from 4 Scots and 9/12th Royal Lancers. Located around 18miles from Camp Bastion, it allows UK forces to watch over a huge swathe of central Helmand and two key roads .

The build-up of the Afghan army and police¿s capability is a key plank in the decision to end UK combat operations. Since January 1, the ANSF have requested British help on just one occasion in this stretch of Helmand . Some 335 soldiers from the Brigade Reconnaissance Force and 90 Afghan troops were deployed on the operation on December 14 last year. As they moved to tackle the suicide bomber, they ran into fire from a group of 20 Taliban. As they moved to tackle the suicide bomber, a massive firefight broke out with up to 20 insurgents at about 9.30am. Lieutenant Colonel Richard Slack, commanding officer of the 9th/12th Royal Lancers, who was overseeing the operation at Kakaran, said: ‘The guy wearing the vest was identified by the sniper moving down a tree line and coming over a ditch. ‘He had a winter shawl on which rose up and the sniper saw he had a machine gun. He was moving to a firing position when the sniper engaged him and the guy exploded. The lack of UK operations has raised hopes presidential elections held on April 5 will be a success ¿ although commanders acknowledge the vote is likely to be blighted by Taliban attacks . Lt Col Richard Slack (pictured left), praised the sniper, saying: 'He has had a great tour of duty'. Pictured right,  soldiers on the base at the Sterga 2 Observation Point . ‘There was a pause on the radio and the sniper said: “I think I’ve just shot a suicide bomber.” The rest of them were killed in the blast.’ The sniper also killed a Taliban machine gunner from a staggering 4,400ft with the first shot of his tour of duty.It is believed he was using a British-built L115A3 Long Range Rifle, the Army's most powerful sniper weapon. He was so far away the 8.59mm-calibre bullet would have taken one second to reach the target. Lt Col Slack said: ‘He has had a great tour of duty.’ Surveillance for the operation was carried out by British troops based at Sterga 2, the observation post built on high ground overlooking the Helmand River. Elections: Separately on Monday, presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah held a campaign rally in Panjshir province. Sterga 2 will operate 10 polling stations on Saturday . A police officer stands with his weapon at a checkpoint in Kabul. Some 450 UK troops have died since operations began in Afghanistan in October 2001 . Located around 18miles from Camp Bastion, it allows UK forces to watch over a huge swathe of central Helmand and two key roads, Highway One and Route 601. The isolated base is manned by a company of troops from the 9th/12th Royal Lancers, 4th Battalion the Royal Regiment of Scotland, the Royal Artillery and Royal Engineers. It uses powerful cameras and sophisticated radars to keep watch for signs of the Taliban trafficking guns, bomb-making equipment or rockets. The state-of-the-art cameras are attached to a surveillance balloon – dubbed the ‘white whale’ by insurgents – which can monitor activity miles away. Troops at Sterga 2 also use Desert Hawk 3 drones – controlled by a Play Station-style handset – to spy on the area.Details of any suspicious behaviour can be relayed to the Afghan National Security Forces – trained by British troops – who investigate. The build-up of the Afghan army and police’s capability is a key plank in the decision to end UK combat operations at the end of the year. And since January 1, the ANSF have requested British help on just one occasion in this stretch of Helmand. No UK operations have been carried out in the fertile ‘green zone’ – where most of the population live – since 7th Armoured Brigade, known as the Desert Rats, began their six-month tour of duty last autumn. It has raised hopes that the presidential elections on April 5 will be a success – although commanders acknowledge the vote is likely to be blighted by Taliban attacks. Sterga 2 will be able to monitor 10 polling stations in a bid to make sure civilians remain safe. Lt Col Slack – who runs the Istar Group for Task Force Helmand, which is responsible surveillance and intelligence – said Helmand was ‘absolutely unrecognisable’ from when he deployed in 2007. He said: ‘I think there is a sense of history and if the elections are delivered in a secure and transparent way, I think it is a historic moment and I’m proud to be part of it.’ British forces using helicopters to help move soldiers and their equipment to minimise the risk of road movements and the threat of IEDs .

Lt Col Slack, who lost one soldier Lance Corporal James Brynin, 22, of the Intelligence Corps, during his stint in charge, acknowledged the cost in lives and money during the war had been ‘heavy’. He said: ‘The price has been heavy for the Army and in particular it has been heavy for the families of those nearly 450 [dead troops], and no one is under any illusions about that. ‘I will finish my tour knowing one of our NCOs will not be coming home and that is a heavy price to pay. ‘Has it been worth it? At my level when I look at security that is here and the way the ANSF have developed I certainly think it’s been worth it. ‘But as a commanding officer I’m not going to sleep properly until the last one of my soldiers is off the ground and back home safely.’ Captain Ed Challis, who was in charge of Sterga 2, said he was not thinking of being at the last British outpost of the war. He said: ‘I’d imagine once I get back it’s something I’ll look back on and sort of realise the historical importance of it but at the moment we’re just focussing on our primary role here. Once I’ve got a beer in hand and looking back at what’s been achieved it will sink in.’","Record-breaking shot was fired by a Coldstream Guards marksman .

The signed will appear  over the stadiums for two hours prior to the games - before federally-enforced no-fly rules take effect. Goodell's decision to suspend Rice for two games caused outrage. The national furor  increased last week when new video emerged of Rice punching his fiance and knocking her unconscious in an Atlantic City, New Jersey, hotel elevator in March. Reports emerged that the NFL had seen the video months ago - despite Goodell publicly claiming otherwise. After the second video came out, Rice was booted from the Ravens and suspended from the NFL indefinitely. 'The NFL Commissioner, Roger Goodell, has been caught in a despicable and disgusting lie and he must resign,' Ultra Violet says. Video emerged this week showing Ray Rice punching his fiance in the face and knocking her unconscious - re-igniting the controversy over the NFL's handling of his case . Adrian Peterson, the biggest star on the Minnesota Vikings, was arrested this weekend after being charged for whipping his young son (right) with a switch and causing several wounds . Standing by his side: Janay Plamer, right, has defended her now-husband Ray Rice after he was arrested for punching her. Rice has been indefinitely suspended from the NFL . Greg Hardy was kicked off the Carolina Panthers roster today - two months after he was convicted of assaulting girlfriend Nicki Holder . The group has started a petition demanding he step down. The fury over Goodell and the NFL's treatment of players arrested for domestic violence has led thousands of Twitter users to begin circulating a shocking Photoshopped picture of a model with a black eye and Baltimore Ravens makeup. The image reads, 'Get your game face on!' The controversial image, which uses an ad for CoverGirl's NFL makeup line, has been shared dozens of times across social media. The NFL season's second football Sunday comes after one of the league's worst weeks in recent memory. This Minnesota Vikings fan (right) wore and Adrian Peterson Jersey to the pre-game tailgate and carried a switch, which the star allegedly used to whip his young son . In addition to the rising criticism over the handling of the Rice case, former MVP Adrian Peterson was arrested in Texas for whipping his young son with a stick and leaving wounds all over the boy's body, including on his genitals. Peterson's lawyer has said the star didn't meant to hurt the boy and was merely using the same kind of discipline he had as a child. The Minnesota Vikings kicked Peterson off their roster and he steered clear of the stadium today - even though he was allowed to watch from the sidelines. That didn't stop Vikings fans from wearing Peterson's jersey by the thousands. Peterson is the biggest star on the team. One tailgating fan even wore a Peterson jersey and carried a switch - like the NFL star allegedly used to whip his son. On Sunday, the Carolina Panthers deactivated one of their biggest stars, Greg Hardy, two months after his conviction by a North Carolina judge for allegedly battering his girlfriend in May. The team had been under mounting pressure to take Hardy off the field following the release of the Rice video this week.","Pressure increases on Roger Goodell after video emerged of Ray Rice punching his fiance in the face and knocking her unconscious .

"An Arizona six-year-old has broken the world record for the half-marathon in his age group after running a two-hour, 19-minute and 48-second half marathon. When Cael Schwartz, six, heard that a six-year-old boy from Texas had run a half marathon, he decided that he wanted to run one, too. He began training with his father Adam Schwartz, setting a personal record of two hours and one minute - a pace of about 10 minutes a mile. Strong finish: Cael Schwartz crosses the finish line after running a two-hour, 19-minute and 48-second marathon . Adam Schwartz ran alongside his son at the Desert Classic in Surprise along with 184 other runners. The course was hard, said the elder Schwartz, with an incline in the first half of the race. 'It’s . a pretty tough half-marathon course in that regard,' Adam told Arizona . Central, 'so we fell about nine, 10 minutes short of our goal, but it . was still a pretty impressive performance.' Impressive . enough, certainly, to break the previous world record, set by a . six-year-old from New Orleans of two hours, 37 minutes and 34 seconds. The record must be submitted to the Association of Road Racing, but it is expected to be accepted. World-record holder: Little Cael Schwartz with his dad, Adam . Adam Schwartz said the half-marathon was the longest race Cael has ever run . Cael, who loves competition and most sports, said he was just 'a little tired' after he finished the race. 'I . felt good,' said Cael, who turned seven the day after the race. 'When I . finished... I just couldn’t believe that I broke the record.' Cael's interest in sports started with Adam Schwartz began competing in triathlons last year. The . then-five-year-old decided he wanted to compete in triathlons too. He's . planning to run in six triathlons this spring in preparation for the . main event. 'My next goal is to win the national championship in triathlons for seven-year-olds in August,' said the determined athlete. Competitive edge: Cael loves competing and does triathlon, wrestling and half-marathons . Cael, the eldest of three boys, has made his his father and his mother, Michelle, very proud with his dedication. 'Both of us through this journey have choked up on occasion,' Adam Schwartx told Arizona Central. 'It’s a pretty neat experience and it’s not one you get to have very often. To be able to share it with family and friends is a very neat experience for us.' Cael wants to run another marathon soon, after he's given his legs a rest. But in the meantime, he plans to take up wrestling.","Cael Schwartz ran a half marathon in two hours, 19 minutes and 48 seconds .

"More than a million Brazilians took to the streets of at least 80 Brazilian towns and cities in demonstrations that saw violent clashes and renewed calls for an end to government corruption and demands for better public services. Riot police battled protesters in at least five cities, with some of the most intense clashes in Rio de Janeiro, where an estimated 300,000 demonstrators swarmed into the city's central area. An 18-year-old man was killed in Sao Paulo after a car drove through barricades, while television images showed police firing tear gas canisters and rubber bullets into crowds of young men, their faces wrapped in T-shirts. The scenes prompted president Dilma Rousseff to end her near-silence on the unrest sweeping the country by declaring that 'the voice of the street must be heard and respected'.

Solidarity: A taxi driver waves from a flyover to show support for several hundred thousand protesters in Rio . Rouseff delivered an address on primetime TV, which saw her pledge to improve public services and hold a dialogue with protest leaders. She said peaceful demonstrations were part of a strong democracy, but that violence could not be tolerated. 'I'm going to meet with the leaders of the peaceful protests, I want institutions that are more transparent, more resistant to wrongdoing,' Rouseff said in referecence to perceptions of deep corruption in Brazilian politics, which is emerging as a focal point of the protests. 'It's citizenship and not economic power that must be heard first,' she said. Flag-waving: A woman waves the Brazilian flag in Fortaleza amid anger over government corruption, high taxes, poor public services, and the billions being spent on the World Cup tournament .

Talks: Although the President vowed to hold talks with protest leaders, it remained unclear who could represent the massive and decentralised groups of demonstrators . But it remained unclear exactly who could represent the massive and decentralised groups of demonstrators taking to the streets to vent their anger at woeful public services in spite of high taxes. The President has called off a scheduled visit to Japan to deal with the crisis. Though offering no details, Rousseff said that her government would create a national plan for public transportation in cities - a hike in bus and subway fares in many cities was the original catalyst for the protests. She also reiterated her backing for a plan before congress to invest all oil revenue royalties in education and a promise she made earlier to bring in foreign doctors to areas that lack physicians.

'Noise and truculence': A riot police officer kicks a tear gas canister in Brazil, where the president spoke out to say the 'voice of the street' could not be confused with the 'truculence of some troublemakers' The leader, a former Marxist rebel who fought against Brazil's 1964-1985 military regime and was imprisoned for three years and tortured by the junta, pointedly referred to earlier sacrifices made to free the nation from dictatorship. 'My generation fought a lot so that the voice of the streets could be heard,' Rousseff said. 'Many were persecuted, tortured and many died for this. The voice of the street must be heard and respected and it can't be confused with the noise and truculence of some troublemakers.' The President had been widely criticised for being all but invisible amid the protests and failing to engage with the people who were demanding her government's attention. Official estimates suggest that there were more than a million protesters out across the country in total. Edvaldo Chaves, a 61-year-old doorman in Rio's upscale Flamengo neighborhood, said he found the president's speech yesterday convincing. 'I thought she seemed calm and cool. Plus, because she was a guerrilla . and was in exile, she talks about the issue of protests convincingly,' Chaves said. 'I think things are going to calm down. We'll probably keep . seeing people in the streets but probably small numbers now.' Others were less sure, including Bruna Romao, an 18-year-old store clerk in Sao Paulo, who said Rousseff's words probably wouldn't have an impact. 'Brazilians are passionate,' she said. 'We boil over quickly but also . cool down fast. But this time it's different, people are in full revolt. I don't see things calming down anytime soon.' Trying to decipher the president's reaction to the unrest had become a . national guessing game, especially after some one million anti-government . demonstrators took to the streets nationwide on Thursday night to denounce . everything from poor public services to the billions of dollars spent . preparing for next year's World Cup soccer tournament and the 2016 . Olympics in Brazil. The protests continued yesterday, as about 1,000 people marched in western .

"Alex Corbisiero will be out of action until ‘early 2015’ with a shoulder ligament problem which will require surgery and a lengthy recovery period. England’s premier No 1 will miss the autumn series against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia and may face a mad dash to prove he is ready for the RBS 6 Nations. As he contemplates another prolonged injury lay-off, the 26-year-old Northampton prop must wonder whether he will ever escape the cyclical spectre of damage, surgery and rehab. Alex Corbisiero, charging forward against Bath on Saturday, is out until early 2015 with a shoulder injury . The England prop needs surgery and faces a long recovery period in yet another set-back to his career . Corbisiero will miss Tests against New Zealand, South Africa, Samoa and Australia and maybe the 6 Nations . Leicester lock Geoff Parling has also been ruled out of the November matches but he has been available for long periods since emerging as a Test player, whereas the same cannot be said for Corbisiero. It is a testament to his rare talent as an accomplished scrummager and mobile forward that New Yorker Corbisiero made it to Australia last summer and had a major hand in a Lions series triumph — starting and excelling in two Tests. His troublesome knees had so nearly denied him that honour, only for an injury to Ireland’s Cian Healy to open the door. Sadly, Corbisiero has played just 19 of 40 possible internationals for England since making his Test debut in February, 2011. There has been a solitary appearance for his country in the past 22 months, as his knees have required frequent medical intervention. Now, having missed the summer tour of New Zealand in order to ensure he tackled this season in peak condition, this latest harsh twist of fate consigns him to another long absence. While this is an unrelated issue - a different joint - the figures point to a persistent problem in terms of withstanding life at the sharp end of his brutal profession. Corbisiero played nine times for Northampton last season, following his transfer from London Irish. In six full seasons in the Aviva Premiership he has started a mere 33 games - no more than six in any one season. When he left the Exiles, their director of rugby, Brian Smith, claimed his knee problems were ‘degenerative’. Geoff Parling (right) is another member of Stuart Lancasters's England squad suffering from injury problems . Geoff Parling receives treatment during Leicester's game against Bath last week . Mike Brown (Harlequins, full back): Sore ribs. Return: this weekend. Dan Cole (Leicester, prop): Neck surgery. Return: late November . Alex Corbisiero (Northampton, prop): Shoulder surgery. Return: ‘early 2015’. Owen Farrell (Saracens, fly-half): Hamstring strain. Return: mid-October. Geoff Parling (Leicester, lock): Persistent concussions. Return: December. Ed Slater (Leicester, lock): Knee ligaments. Return: next season. Manu Tuilagi (Leicester, centre): Groin injury. Return: weekend after next. Mako Vunipola (Saracens, prop): Knee surgery. Return: November. Anthony Watson (Bath, wing): Foot injury. Return: possibly Friday. Tom Wood (Northampton, flanker): Back injury. Return: 1-2 weeks. Tom Youngs (Leicester, hooker): Shoulder operation. Return: late December. The player himself is well aware that Joe Marler has established himself as a pedigree Test performer and that Mako Vunipola, while also likely to miss the autumn matches, is another high-class alternative. No wonder Corbisiero recently explained that his priority is simply to play, saying: ‘My main goal for this season is to stay healthy, stay fit, keep playing and build back my old form and keep improving. The knees feel good. My load is managed. I’m in as good a shape as I’ve ever been.’ Unfortunately, that positive state was shattered by a collision during Saturday’s home win over Bath. A statement issued by Northampton on Tuesday read: ‘Alex has sustained a ligament tear to his shoulder that will keep the England prop out of action until early 2015. ‘The specialist’s advice is that the tear needs surgical repair so that he can play to an optimum level in the future.’ Meanwhile, Leicester confirmed that Parling will take an enforced rest in an attempt to alleviate his recurring concussion problems. ‘He saw the relevant specialist this week and will have time out of the game now,’ said Richard Cockerill, the Tigers’ director of rugby. Manu Tuilagi (in action for England against New Zealand) is recovering from a groin injury . ‘He’ll probably be another couple of months out - probably three or four weeks of complete down time and then he’ll be reintegrated into training. You’d like to think that by December he’ll be playing again. And there’s no doubt about that, he will play again.’ On a brighter note, Cockerill insisted that Manu Tuilagi’s groin injury is not serious, even though it will keep him out of Saturday’s trip to Gloucester. ‘He’s improving well but he’s not quite where he needs to be,’ he said. ‘We find that most of the Pacific Island boys heal quite slowly. Manu’s brothers were exactly the same. The Tuilagi gene is big, quick and nasty, but slow healers. When they’re fit they’re dangerous, but when they’re injured they slow down!’","Corbisiero tore ligament during Northampton's win over Bath on Saturday .

"Civil rights activists have demanded that a Django Unchained actress apologize for accusing police of singling her out because of her race. Daniele Watts hit out at the Los Angeles Polcie Department, who she claimed pulled her up and arrested her for kissing her boyfriend in a car parked on the street last week. However, police maintain that there was no racial element to the incident, and that their officer was responding to reports of a couple having sex in public - leading to a backlash from civil rights experts, who accuse Watts of 'crying wolf' to cover her own back. Confrontation: Daniele Watts,left, is seen with two LAPD officers. She claims she was targeted due to race . 'Crying wolf': Watts, pictured with boyfriend Brian Lucas, has come under fire from civil rights activists . An audio recording, obtained by MailOnline, reveals a hysterical Watts confronting police in a heated exchange during which she uses the N-word, and claims legal expertise from her experience playing a cop on TV. The fallout from the incident led to prominent civil rights activists decrying Watts in public and saying that she was harming their cause. Los Angeles Urban Policy Roundtable President Earl Ofari Hutchinson, Project Islamic Hope President Najee Ali and others released a statement this morning in the Inglewood area of LA. Silver screen: Watts is pictured above as Coco, a house servant she played in the Tarantino film . Hutchinson said: 'There was provable cause for the detention. You must have your facts. You can't rush to judgment. If you do that, you have no credibility.' According to NBC, he added: 'It's like crying wolf - after a while, it has no meaning.' Ali also spoke against her, CBS reported. He said: 'She should be embarrassed. She's the one that told the lie. She came and stated she's a victim of racial profiling. We found out later on based on new information that she wasn't,' The newly-unearthed audio file came shortly after still images showed Watts straddling her boyfriend Brian James Lucas in a car. Recordings captured the moment that police slapped handcuffs on Miss Watts after she walked away from an officer who asked to see her identification. Watts and the officers involved disputed whether her ID card was necessary, followed by Watts bringing her acting experience into the fray. 'I played a copy on TV!' Daniele Watts, who has accused the LAPD of harassment, played police cadet Angela Mullen in the Showtime comedy 'Weeds' Attacks: Watts did not get an easy ride on social media, as the above tweet by radio host Larry Elder shows . In the audio recording, Miss Watts sobs after being cuffed. An officer can be heard trying to calm her down. She tells him through tears: 'You're not the one in handcuffs, you're not the one who's spent your life being called a n*****, and growing up in the South and now I get the cops called on me. 'I'm an actress at this studio! I'm in a major sitcom and I'm still being put in handcuffs because I'm making out with my boyfriend.' Sgt Jim Parker, a 25-year veteran of the LAPD, says he was offended by claims that Miss Watts was harassed because she is a black woman with a white boyfriend. Sgt Parker said he's witnessed first hand many of the department's most dramatic moments - including the 1992 riots over the beating of black motorist Rodney King and the 1997 North Hollywood shoot out. Throughout his career, he says he has watched the LAPD become dramatically more sensitive to race relations and diversity. Miss Watts and Mrs Lucas maintain they were doing nothing wrong - and that they were only making out, not having sex. Sgt Parker said he fears that if he and other officers had not recorded their run-in with Miss Watts, her allegations would have ruined their careers. 'She picked the wrong person to make a public incident out of a private matter,' he said. The LAPD has said it is conducting a review of the officers' behavior, but all three remain on the streets. MailOnline has contacted Watts's agent for comment.","Police stopped Daniele Watts after reports of couple having sex in public .

"Gordon Ramsay allegedly told his business partner, Rowen Seibel, he was the 'trademark queen' during a row with a Florida restaurant . Feisty celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay has been accused of running Los Angeles restaurant The Fat Cow as a 'dictatorship' - before shutting it down and re-opening under a different name. Ramsay's business partner, Rowen Seibel, claims in a New York civil suit the ill-tempered cook made business decisions and ruled the burger joint with an iron fist, mimicking his demanding persona on the TV series Hell's Kitchen. Seibel claims Ramsay 'secretly shut down' The Fat Cow last month before re-opening on his own under the name GR Roast, in a $10.8 million suit rubbished by Ramsay's people as 'ridiculous'. And Siebel claims Ramsay assured him he would take care of a trademark problem surrounding Las Vacas Gordas, a Spanish restaurant in Florida who had registered The Fat Cow, alleging the chef told him: 'I am the trademark queen'. 'Ramsay attempted to run the business and make decisions on behalf of (his partners) similar to his television personality on Hell's Kitchen — as a dictatorship,' Seibel claims in court papers via his lawyer Paul Sweeney. 'Instead, in a dramatic money grab and breach of his fiduciary obligation to Seibel, Fat Cow LLC and FCLA, Gordon Ramsay began taking steps to secretly shut down Fat Cow Restaurant, using the trademark issue as his straw man excuse, and open a new restaurant at the premises without Seibel.' Scroll down for video . Gordon Ramsay visits his restaurant The Fat Cow at The Grove. It has now shut down and re-opened under a different name . Hell's Kitchen: Ramsay is accused of running The Fat Cow with the sane fiery persona made famous by his hit reality TV series . Seibel's original investment in The Fat Cow totalled around $800,000 . When challenged on a trademark row with Florida's Las Vacas Gordas restaurant, Ramsay allegedly told Seibel: 'I am the trademark queen'. Seibel invested $800,000 in The Fat Cow, . which opened in 2012, but is not involved in Ramsay's new venture, . where he will also film his reality TV series, Page Six reports. 'We're surprised that Mr Seibel has the audacity to file this ridiculous suit when he and his team were responsible for the day to day running of The Fat Cow and spectacularly mismanaged it resulting in a string of financial and legal issues,' a spokesman for Ramsay told MailOnline. 'Gordon Ramsay and his team immediately stepped in and tried to resolve these issues, but Seibel refused to engage in any meaningful conversations, rendering the restaurant unsustainable. 'Throughout, Ramsay was very forthcoming with Seibel that any future plan for another restaurant partnership in Los Angeles was impossible due to Seibel's refusal to operate and fund the restaurant properly, sadly including Seibel diverting funds from the business.' Ramsay was sued by The Fat Cow staff members in a class action last year, where it was alleged they were paid below minimum wage and not given proper breaks.","Investor Rowen Seibel claims Ramsay 'secretly shut down' The Fat Cow .

"Michelle Obama has revealed that there is one look that she feels she can't pull off: shorts. The First Lady is regularly hailed for her fashion sense but said that she felt she stepped across the bounds by showing off her legs. During a visit to BET talk show '106 and Park', she cited one of her more casual trips on Air Force One as her biggest fashion faux pas. No go: The First Lady, seen here in 2009 with her daughter Malia, said that there was some backlash after she wore shorts on Air Force One so she doesn't really wear shorts anymore . Fashion forward: Michelle Obama made an appearance on BET's talk show '106 and Park' on Tuesday . 'Sometimes as First Lady, sometimes I forget I’m the First Lady and I’m running around in shorts,' she said, referring to an August 2009 trip to the Grand Canyon. 'I know the first time we went on a family vacation, I had shorts on getting off of Air Force One and that created a huge stink because people were like, she’s wearing shorts getting off of Air Force One. And I thought, ""what, we’re on vacation!""' Since that backlash, she has shied away from wearing shorts, opting for longer capris or skirts and dresses in hotter climates. She also cools off by opting for sleeveless shirts that show her toned arms- including in her official White House portrait. Raising eyebrows: She said that the problem arose because sometimes she forgets that she is the First Lady and should dress as such at all times . Other than the slight slip up in 2009, Mrs Obama wasn't able to think of any other fashion missteps. 'I kind of always am happy with what I’m wearing,' she said. Mrs Obama said that in addition to every fashion choice being scrutinized another downside of living in the White House is the lack of anonymity. 'Being able to walk out your front door on your own without agents, people following you around,' she said. 'I just long to walk out that front door, go to CVS and buy some toothpaste, and nobody would notice me.' She said that it was easier for her to go on dog walks or unannounced trips to Target in the beginning of her husband's presidency, and she used a baseball cap to help her go incognito, but she recalled how one time she thought her disguise was not enough. 'The first time I did that I was in an aisle, one woman walked up to me and she tapped me on the shoulder, and I thought, ""Okay, she's seen me."" And she said, ""Can you reach up there and hand me that detergent?""' Mrs Obama said. Partners in stride: Mrs Obama, seen with her husband on Wednesday as they head to the Medal of Freedom ceremony, said that the President sings on a regular basis . She went on to praise her husband's musical skills, which he has demonstrated at a number of events where he slipped in a few lines of a song. 'It was really sweet. But he sings all the time. Oh, yes, he’s in the bathroom all the time just singing,' she said. 'He is always willing to sing. He’s like, ""You want me to sing now, want me to sing something for you?"" But he has got a good voice.' He may hog the family's musical talent but she said it is very well understood that she is the dancing queen in the Obama household.

"Fox News is again under fire from because of their handling of Bradley Manning’s announcement that he’d prefer to be a she named Chelsea—this time for mocking Manning with a song. With a photo of Chelsea beside one of Manning as Bradley, Fox and Friends played ‘Dude (Looks Like a Lady)’ by Aerosmith as they went to commercial Tuesday morning. The jab at the convicted intelligence leaker comes just a few days after transgender allies bemoaned the network’s steadfast refusal last week to refer to Manning as ‘she.’ Low blow: Fox News is being criticized for playing the Aerosmith song Dude (Looks Like a Lady) specifically to mock Chelsea Manning . ‘I don't do what Bradley Manning wants me to do,’ said host of Fox News’ American Newsroom host Gregg Jarrett on Friday. Fox is not, however, the only major network to refuse to use the gender pronouns Manning prefers. CNN reasons that they should continue referring to Manning as ‘he’ because the former soldier, who is now is at Fort Leavenworth in Kansas serving 35 years for leaking mountains of classified material to the anti-secrecy website WikiLeaks, has not begun hormone therapy or changed ‘his’ gender through surgical means. Manning has announced her intention to do so, however, which is what spurred the debate to begin with. Refusal: Fox anchor Gregg Jarrett said he will not follow Manning's wishes to be referred to as a 'she' ‘As I transition into this next phase of my life,’ the 25-year-old said in a statement Thursday, ‘I want everyone to know the real me. I am Chelsea Manning. I am a female. Given the way that I feel, and have felt since childhood, I want to begin hormone therapy as soon as possible.’ Her attorney David Coombs told The Associated Press on Monday that Manning hoped the prison 'will simply do the right thing' over their request for hormone treatment so she won't have to sue. Coombs said that the soldier had known for a long time she would make a statement about her identity, but 'she wanted, essentially, for the media surrounding the trial to dissipate.' 'I am Chelsea': Manning expressed wishes to be called a 'she' and to begin hormone therapy last week . 'Everything in my power': Manning's attorney David Coombs has vowed to fight for the former soldier to receive hormones . A media frenzy ensued, nonetheless, and much of the ado surrounded Manning’s choice of pronouns. Two of the highest profile news organization’s in America—the Associated Press and the New York Times—quickly issued statements concerning the issue. ‘The Associated Press will henceforth use Pvt. Chelsea E. Manning and female pronouns for the soldier formerly known as Bradley Manning, in accordance with her wishes to live as a woman,’ came the AP’s official statement. The AP’s stance, which applies to all transgender individuals, is the exact opposite of Fox News’. ‘People out there, don't send me angry emails that I refered to him as Bradley and not Chelsea and him instead of her,’ Jarrett said. ‘So thanks very much.’","Last week, Bradley Manning revealed she wishes to live as a woman named Chelsea .
The military prison where she is serving a 35-year sentence said it would not provide hormone treatment but Manning has said she will pay for it .

"His name is one of the most famous in the world of sport - yet almost nobody knows who the man was. Roland Garros has become synonymous with clay court tennis since the French Open was named in his honour in 1928. Now, his name is daubed in green and rust-red . on almost every surface available to marketeers at Stade Roland . Garros in Paris - from tennis balls and benches to parasols and sun hats. You might think he would at least have something to do with tennis. Dashing: Born on the French isle of Reunion in 1888, Garros grew into one of the most important pioneers of world aviation before becoming a daredevil dog-fighter during the First World War . Brave: Roland Garros (left of propeller, in beret) is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage-mounted machine-gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself . 'For a lot of people in France and abroad, Garros is a tennis man, or a sometime president of the French Tennis Federation (FFT),' Michael Guittard, head of collections and cultural mediation at the FFT, told CNN. 'Everybody knows the name of Roland Garros, but nobody knows who he was. That's why we have an exhibition to explain that he is not a tennis champion, but a hero of World War One.' Born on the French isle of Reunion in 1888, Garros grew into one of the most important pioneers of world aviation before becoming a daredevil dog-fighter during the First World War. Exposed to the elements:  Garros in his Santos-Dumont Demoiselle aeroplane, who took part in the 1911 European Circuit race . Brave: Such was his bravery, that he is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage-mounted machine-gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself . Tyranny in the skies: Despite unleashing fear on the German airmen of the First World War, his tyranny over the skies could not last forever, ending when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash-land behind enemy lines in April 1915, as depicted in this 1915 edition of Le Petit Journal . Daredevil: Roland Garros (center), on an aerial propeller driven slider in 1912 . Such was his bravery, that he is credited as the first person to shoot another plane down using a fuselage-mounted machine-gun that could shoot through a propeller - one he designed himself. He went on to shoot down three more over the Western Front, bringing his kill-count to four - one short of the required tally of a recognised 'flying ace'. Here is one account of the day Garros was captured in 1915, published in the 'Schwabishen Merkur' newspaper by a Württemberger cavalry medical officer. 'At about 7 o'clock in the evening of 18 April two enemy aircraft, flying very high, appeared over the area between Sainte-Katherine and Lendelede. One was shot at by one of our Ballonabwehrkanone and he disappeared in the direction of Menin. 'The other flew away over Lendelede in a north-easterly direction. At that moment we saw a southbound train approaching on the railway line Ingelmunster-Kortrijk. Suddenly the plane went into a steep dive of about 60 degrees from a height of about 2,000 metres to about 40 metres from the ground. 'He flew over the train in a loop and as he rose up into the sky again with his wings almost vertical, he threw a bomb at the train. Fortunately it missed the target and there was no damage. 'The bomb landed about 40 metres east of the track and blew a crater about one metre deep and two metres in diameter. The driver of the locomotive brought the train to a stop.As the plane had swooped down over the train the Bahnschutzwache troops had fired on it following my order to open fire. We shot at him from a distance of only 100 metres as he flew past. 'After he had thrown his bomb at the train he tried to escape, switching his engine on again and climbing to about 700 metres through the shots fired by our troops. But suddenly the plane began to sway about in the sky, the engine fell silent, and the pilot began to glide the plane down in the direction of Hulste.'I immediately got on on my bicycle and set off to chase the plane, accompanied by some of the men from my unit on foot. As soon as the plane landed the pilot set it on fire and ran to a farmhouse in Hulst. 'I was the first to arrive at the scene of the burning plane. Several others soon joined me and my men, including some dragoons from a Württemberger cavalry brigade, as we searched for the airman in Hulste.' But his greatest achievement was to invent a machine gun that could be fired forward through a plane's propeller arc. Until Garros, the only way airmen could shoot at enemy planes was with handheld guns from the cockpit. So Garros masterminded a method of attaching wedge-shaped steel plates to the propeller that deflected stray bullets from hitting the blades. 'The rate of fire was that most of the bullets would miss the propeller, but every so often one would strike it,' Peter Jakab, chief curator at the U.S.'s Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum told CNN. 'It wasn't very efficient, but in the very early months of the war when airplanes were either defenseless or carrying hand-held weapons, this technique made his aircraft more lethal than anything flying.' He added: 'Over a very short period of time he shot down a number of German airplanes and created quite some terror among the German pilots.' But his tyranny over the skies could not last forever, ending when a clogged fuel line forced him to crash-land behind enemy lines in April 1915. He was captured by German troops before he was able to destroy his plane and, crucially, his state-of-the-art machine gun that had unleashed such fear on his airborne combatants. Within hours of his capture, the machine-gun firing device and the Morane's propellor were sent to the Fokker aircraft factory in Germany. It was a mere few weeks later that the Dutchman Anthony Fokker produced the first single-seater airplane - the Fokker EI - for the German Air Force fitted with machine-guns, deflectors and an interrupter gear which could synchronise the rate of fire of the gun with the speed of the propellor. Over the next three years, while Garros languished as a prisoner of war, Fokker was busy honing the Frenchman's design into a synchronization gear that stopped bullets hitting the propeller altogether. The results were devastating as Germany's Fokker D VII planes, mounted with the new device, began downing allied aircraft in their dozens, prompting the British press to coin the phrase the 'Fokker Scourge.' While Garros was 'one of the early pioneers of developing a tactic in an aircraft-specific . role', according to Jakab, dog-fighting tactics and formation flying changed dramatically while he was in prison. By the time he escaped in 1918, his methods of airborne warfare had become outdated and he was shot down and killed on October 5 that year - a day before his 30th birthday and five weeks before Armistice Day on November 11 - near the French town of Vouziers, close to the Belgian border. His killer was flying a Fokker D VII. Pioneer: In 1912, two years after making his first flight, Garros won the prestigious Circuit de Anjou flying race before becoming the first man to fly across the Mediterranean Sea on September 23 1913, as depicted in this issue of Le Petit Journal . Recognised: There is a statue of Roland Garros in Saint-Denis, Reunion, where he was born in 1888 . Renowned: Now, his name is daubed in green and rust-red on almost every surface available to marketeers at Paris' Stade Roland Garros - from tennis balls and benches to parasols and sun hats . 'He was surpassed by the war and by this technique that he had pioneered,' added Jakab. 'But he was a great war hero.' But Garros is not only remembered for his wartime heroics. In 1911 Garros began flying Blériot monoplanes entering a number of European races, including the 1911 Paris to Madrid air race and the Circuit of Europe (Paris-London-Paris), in which he came second. In September that year he established a new world altitude record of 5,610 m (18,410 ft) In 1912, two years after making his first flight, he won the prestigious Circuit de Anjou flying race before becoming the first man to fly across the Mediterranean Sea on September 23 1913.","Roland Garros was a pioneer of aviation and WW1 daredevil dog fighter .

"Anderson Silva has been suspended after failing a second drug test, carried out after his comeback victory over Nick Diaz last month. The former UFC middleweight champion tested positive for steroids and for anti-anxiety medication, having also failed a test on January 9. Silva, who has denied taking any performance-enhancing substances, passed a further test on January 19. Anderson Silva has failed two drug tests, one before and one after his comeback fight against Nick Diaz . The steroid he tested positive for was Drostanolone which is popular with bodybuilders, while there was also traces of Oxazepam and Temazepam, which can be used to treat insomnia. Although the medication is not banned, it must be noted on the medical questionnaire submitted before any fight. Silva was already facing a nine-month ban for his first failed test but the Nevada State Athletic Commission chief executive director Bob Bennett did not know if that would be extended. 'I can't speak for the [NSAC] chairman nor can I speak for the commissioners,' he told ESPN.com. Silva tested positive for steroids and for anti-anxiety medication and has been suspended by the UFC . 'But something I find particularly concerning is that he tested positive on January 9 and then he tested negative on January 19. If he took this orally, it only stays in your system five to seven days. 'So, obviously, he used it some time around January 9 and then he used it shortly before the night of the fight. Whether the commission finds this egregious - that he tested positive twice out of three times - is up to them. 'I certainly find it concerning and unacceptable. It gives an unfair advantage to the person on that. God forbid, a serious injury were to occur to an opponent when someone is on something.' After his first failed test, Silva said: 'I have not taken any performance-enhancing drugs. My stance on drugs is, and will always be, the same. I’m an advocate for a clean sport.' Silva has denied taking performance-enhancing drugs but will learn his fate at a disciplinary hearing in March . He will learn his fate when the NSAC hold a disciplinary hearing next month. UFC president Dana White and CEO Lorenzo Fertitta will hold a special press conference on Wednesday in which they are expected to address the drug scandals that have engulfed the organisation in recent months.

"Former heavyweight champion Frank Mir rolled back the years in Porto Alegre on Sunday night with a first-round knockout win over Antonio 'Bigfoot' Silva. The win for the American veteran, his first in his last five UFC outings, defied the odds for the ninth time at the Brazilian event, which will be remembered as a night of major upsets. After a tentative minute and a half of action to open the main event, Mir landed a jab followed by a clean left hook that sent the Brazilian hurtling to the canvas before a series of grounded strikes left referee Leon Roberts with no choice but to stop the contest.

Mir credited his year-long lay-off as one of the major factors behind the victory, due to him spending his time away from competition to focus on his pugilistic skills. ‘I came out looking for the jab,’ explained Mir in his post-fight address. ‘I know that he hits hard, he’s got a long right hand, so both my striking and wrestling coach told me to switch back to orthodox. Mir landed a string of clean punches to floor Silva before a series of grounded strikes ended the bout . ‘I took some time off, learned how to box the correct way and that’s why you saw the jab setting up. The dominating jab is one of the important punches, especially in the heavyweight division. ‘I was banged up and I was facing top five guys, four of five times in a row. I was hindered and injured, and I wasn’t at 100 per cent, but I had that never say die attitude where I’d never turn down fights. ‘Since that accident and everything that’s happened in my life, the comebacks and the mental fortitude, it could have been a hindrance like it was too much of a mountain to climb.’ Brazilian Edson Barboza (right) kicks Michael Johnson of the United States in their lightweight bout .

"Red Bull design guru Adrian Newey has criticised the 'restrictive' nature of the Formula One regulations which have played their part in his decision to take a back-seat role this season. Red Bull's chief technical officer will shift his focus away from grand prix racing to helping Sir Ben Ainslie design a yacht to challenge for the America's Cup. Whilst still involved with Red Bull, Newey will be less hands on than in the past, primarily as he feels F1 has become an engine formula at present, offering him little scope to make a difference. Adrian Newey will shift his focus away from grand prix racing this season to concentrate on a sailing project . 'You can always improve, but the problem is the limitation of the regulations, so much so the car is designed for you,' said Newey. 'Formula One should be a blend of the driver, chassis and engine, but the current regulations have swung too much in favour of the engine, combined with a very restrictive set of regulations on the chassis. 'As the engine manufacturer has the benefit, it's difficult for the chassis manufacturer to make enough of a difference to overturn that.' In Red Bull's case they saw their four successive years of title-winning success ended in crushing fashion by Mercedes last season. Former Red Bull driver Sebastian Vettel in action at the first pre-season test in Jerez earlier this year . Mercedes won 16 of the 19 grands prix, with Red Bull claiming the other three via Daniel Ricciardo, which was a triumph in itself given power-unit supplier Renault's woes in pre-season. Renault, though, have conceded they were 10 per cent down on power last term compared to Mercedes, highlighting just how far they were on the backfoot. Concessions have been made for this season that will allow the power units to be developed via the use of a complicated token system. It at least allows Renault and Ferrari the opportunity to cut into Mercedes' advantage, although Newey feels the latter will still be way out in front. 'Renault have done a very good job of developing the engine over the winter, but you don't overcome a 10 per cent deficit in a few months and that is the position we're in,' added Newey. 'We're better than last year but still considerably down on where Mercedes were, which is not taking into account any findings they've had over the winter. 'Mercedes clearly are the favourites, they have a very good team and a great power unit.'","Adrian Newey says the sport's new regulations have played a part in his decision to take a back-seat role this season .
