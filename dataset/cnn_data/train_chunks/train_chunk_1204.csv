"The investigation into how Bowe Bergdahl came to leave his base in Afghanistan is to start next week, after the Army appointed a General to lead the inquiry. The two-star General, whose identity has not been released, will examine the events leading up to Bergdahl's departure from the base in June 2009. Bergdahl, who was held as a prisoner-of-war by the Taliban for five years, finally returned to the U.S. in the early hours of Friday. Home ground: Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl, pictured moments before being freed by the Taliban, has arrived at a medical center in San Antonio . Inquiry: A General is due to begin an investigation into the capture of Bowe Bergdahl, believed to be the man circled. The 28-year-old was flown to a Texas base, above, on Friday . After his release was secured when the U.S. negotiated a deal to free five Taliban prisoners from Guantanamo Bay, Bergdahl was taken to a military hospital in Germany. It is not clear when the 28-year-old, who was kept locked in a metal box for two years during his ordeal, will be questioned formally about his experiences. Although he is described as being physically healthy, Bergdahl is still recovering from the trauma of being held captive by the Taliban. He was kept in solitary confinement for at least two years after failed attempts to escape his captors. Military commanders said during a press conference on Friday that Bergdahl was a normal person who went through an abnormal event, and said that part of his rehabilitation process was readjusting to normal life. Background: The investigation will look at what led to Bergdahl, pictured with a Taliban fighter before he was freed last month, leaving his base in Afghanistan and being held captive for five years . Steps to recovery: After being rescued, above, Bergdahl was taken to a hospital on a US Air Base in Germany . 'The skills he used to survive his five-year ordeal may not be healthy now,' General Joseph DeSalvo said. As he continues his rehabilitation at the Army medical center in San Antonio, Texas, the investigation into his disappearance will get under way. Part of it will examine what led to Bergdahl leaving his base, which resulted in his capture. An investigation at the time concluded that he had left of his own free will, but a military official has told CNN the Army has no definitive proof that he deserted. Bergdahl has not yet been reunited with his parents. It is not unusual for former hostages to delay meeting close friends and family, as it can be an emotional strain. Army life: Bergdahl, left, was a member of Blackfoot Company, 1st . Battalion 501st infantry Regiment . Overjoyed: Bergdahl's parents, Jani and Bob, pictured with Obama, have not been reunited with their son . A spokesman for his parents, Bob and Jani, said they were overjoyed that he had returned to the U.S. They are waiting for the right moment to visit their son, who is currently being cared for by a specially trained team who have been preparing for his return since he was first taken hostage.","Inquiry into why Sergeant left his base due to start next week .

"A man who took cellphone photos up the skirts of women riding the Boston subway did not violate state law because the women were not nude or partially nude, Massachusetts' highest court ruled Wednesday. The Supreme Judicial Court overruled a lower court that had upheld charges against Michael Robertson, who was arrested in August 2010 by transit police who set up a sting after getting reports that he was using his cellphone to take photos and video up female riders' skirts and dresses. The ruling immediately prompted top Beacon Hill lawmakers to pledge to update state law. Scroll down for video . Upskirt: If the dog were wearing underwear, taking a photo like this wouldn't be illegal, according to Massachusetts' highest court . Existing so-called Peeping Tom laws protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude, but the way the law is written, it does not protect clothed people in public areas, the court said. 'A female passenger on a MBTA trolley who is wearing a skirt, dress, or the like covering these parts of her body is not a person who is ""partially nude,"" no matter what is or is not underneath the skirt by way of underwear or other clothing,' the court said in its ruling. State law 'does not apply to photographing (or videotaping or electronically surveilling) persons who are fully clothed and, in particular, does not reach the type of upskirting that the defendant is charged with attempting to accomplish on the MBTA,' the court said. The SJC said that while such actions should be illegal, they are not, given the way state law is written. Suffolk County prosecutors said their interpretation of the state's Peeping Tom law was that 'upskirt' photos are illegal. Change: District Attorney Dan Conley says that laws need to be changed in order for the Court to criminalize 'upskirt' photography . District Attorney Dan Conley said prosecutors are hoping state lawmakers will change the wording of the statute by the end of this legislative session. 'What we have is not that the Supreme Judicial Court is saying this is OK,' Conley said. 'The statutory language just didn't quite fit the conduct.' In its ruling, the court said that other states, including New York and Florida, have passed laws specifically criminalizing upskirt photos, noting that women have an expectation of privacy under their clothing. Washington lawmakers closed a loophole in that state's voyeurism law a decade ago, after a similar ruling there. Conley added that this conduct has become more and more prevalent, and he urged riders to be alert. 'This action is immoral and reprehensible; don't do it,' he said. A telephone message left with Michelle Menken, Robertson's attorney, was not immediately returned. Senate President Therese Murray said she was 'stunned and disappointed' with the court ruling. She said the Senate will respond quickly. 'We have fought too hard and too long for women's rights to take the step backward,' Murray said in a statement. 'I am in disbelief that the courts would come to this kind of decision and outraged at what it means for women's privacy and public safety.' Awareness: Conley says that this conduct has become more and more prevalent, and he urged riders to be on the lookout for any upskirt photogs . Gina Scaramella, executive director of the Boston Area Rape Crisis Center, said such photos are a serious invasion of privacy. She said the law needs to catch up to technology. 'It really is a form of sexual harassment. It's a violation for the person who is unknowingly getting their body photographed,' she said. 'People wear clothing for a reason and having someone violate that privacy is a real problem.' MBTA spokesman Joe Pesaturo said that Transit Police support the Suffolk County District Attorney's efforts to work with the Legislature in rewriting the statute. He did not say what the MBTA could do in the meantime to prevent the activity. Pesaturo said that in the past three years, T police have investigated 13 'secretly photographing' cases. In some cases, the alleged offender was issued a court summons. Some remain open investigations. During those three years there was an average of 395 million passenger trips on the MBTA.","Currently, Massachusetts law says it's only illegal to photograph a person without their consent if they are nude or partially nude .

"His death could so easily have been marked with a simple service in an almost empty chapel. Harold Jellicoe Percival, a last link to the Dambusters raid, never married and had no children. When he died last month aged 99 he had no close friends and it seemed there would be no one to mourn him except a handful of care home staff. But yesterday, after a newspaper appeal led to an internet campaign highlighting the forgotten war veteran’s case, hundreds of people who never knew him came to pay their respects at his funeral – poignantly held at 11am on Armistice Day. Scroll down for video . Remembrance: Hundreds of people turned out for the funeral of Harold Jellicoe Percival in Lancashire . Coffin: The former airman's casket was wrapped in a British flag and the Dambusters theme was played as it was carried in . March: Many of those who turned out to Mr Percival's funeral were apparently in the military themselves . Well-wishers: Two out of the hundreds of mourners who attended Mr Percival's funeral despite never having met him . Emotion: One mourner wept at the moving event, which came after it emerged that Mr Percival had no close family to attend the service . Veteran: Harold Jellicoe Percival, who died last month aged 99, served with Bomber Command during the Second World War . The extraordinary turnout of strangers . included many children, alongside current and former military personnel . in uniform, some on leave from Afghanistan. All were determined to . honour the service Mr Percival gave his country with Bomber Command as . ground crew on the famous May 1943 raids by 617 Squadron. Beneath . a grey sky they queued at the crematorium in Lytham St Annes, . Lancashire. Around 100 filled the pews within, another 400 or so for . whom there were not enough seats stood outside in the rain. After . the funeral cortege arrived a two-minute silence was observed, then Mr . Percival’s coffin, draped in the Union and RAF flags, was carried in to . the chapel to the strains of The Dambusters March amid spontaneous . applause. The Reverend Alan . Clark told mourners: ‘You have come in numbers surpassing anything that . was expected. You come not because you knew him, but because each of us . are part of each other. We have a common humanity.’ He . also told them: ‘We marvel at the power of the printed word’, referring . to the short notice appealing for mourners which the undertakers had . placed in the local paper. The . funeral organisers were contacted by veterans’ groups and other . military supporters keen to acknowledge Mr Percival and the appeal was . quickly picked up by others on social networking sites. Overcrowding: So many mourners attended the funeral that they could not fit inside the crematorium . Silence: A trumpeter played the Last Post to remember the dead at 11am . Youngsters: Two of the younger mourners who turned out to pay their last respects to Mr Percival . Sermon: The vicar told those gathered that the funeral was testament to the power of the written word . Gratitude: Janet Wareing, a matron at Mr Percival's care home, spoke at his funeral . After . the service, which ended with the Last Post, Mr Percival’s nephew . Andrew Collyer-Worsell said of the turnout: ‘It’s staggering. It shows . how great the British public are. He was not a hero, he was just someone . who did his duty in World War Two. We were expecting a few people, a . few local veterans, but it snowballed. It’s very emotional.’ Undertaker . Eddie Jacobs said: ‘This was a man with only a couple of very distant . relatives going to his last resting place alone. The British people . responded like only the British can.’ Among . the mourners were staff from Alistre Lodge care home in Lytham St . Annes, where Mr Percival spent the last two years of his life before . dying on October 25. Matron . Janet Wareing said: ‘He would talk about the war sometimes. His sort of . role has often been forgotten. He would remove the corpses of the . aircrew from bombers when they returned full of bullet holes. Then he . would try to keep the plane in the air ready for the next mission. It . was very harrowing.’ Standing still: The funeral began at 11am on Armistice Day, when Britain stops to remember those who died in war . Pride: Hundreds wanted to express support for the war hero who died last month . His final journey: Mr Percival's coffin is unloaded from its hearse at the crematorium . Honour: A line of cadets queuing up in the rain during the former RAF serviceman's funeral ceremony . Harold . Jellicoe Percival's funeral was disrupted today when the extremist . British National Party tried to use the event to promote itself. Amongst . the floral tributes was a bunch of flowers with a card reading: 'Stand . Down Soldier... Nick Griffin MEP and the British National Party'. An undertaker removed the flowers from display after BNP members began to draw attention to them by photographing them. But . a party official asked angrily: 'Who has taken the flowers? They are . from an MEP. If it was an MP from another party they would be left . alone.' However, when . they demanded the return of the flowers, they were told: 'This is not a . funeral for politicians or politics. There is no place for that here . today.' Group . Captain Bob Kemp of the RAF Benevolent Fund said: ‘Harold Percival . served in perhaps the most famous unit of World War Two. It is fitting . that he should be given this sort of send-off. It is remarkable.’ Mr . Percival, a distant relative of Spencer Perceval – who in 1812 became . the only British prime minister to be assassinated – was born in Penge, . South-East London. The only love of his life, Jessie Campbell, is understood to have died of tuberculosis in 1935. After . the war Mr Percival emigrated to Australia, working as a decorator. He . returned to Britain and lived in hotels until he moved into the care . home where he died. Elsewhere in Britain, silence fell at 11am as multiple acts of remembrance were held across the country. The . last surviving First World War widow, Dorothy Ellis, was among the . guests at the national Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire. The memorial bears the names of more than 16,000 fallen service personnel.

"Al Qaeda-linked militants have taken control of Iraq's strategic city of Fallujah, it has emerged. It is the latest in a series of protests by Sunni Arabs who claim to be marginalised by the Shia-led government. Fighting broke out on Thursday after army troops disbanded a Sunni protest camp in nearby capital of the Levant province, Ramadi. Response: The Iraqi army is surrounding Fallujah, and has deployed tanks and artillery ahead of an all-out military assault to retake the city . Iraqi troops and allied tribesmen surrounded the city on Wednesday, firing artillery at up to 150 militants, an anonymous military official said. On Saturday, police abandoned the city and have now taken up posts on the outskirts to prevent the fighters roaming further. Hadi Razeij, head of the Anbar police force, told Arabic language broadcaster al-Arabiya: 'The walls of the city are in the hands of the police force, but the people of Fallujah are the prisoners of ISIL.' Fallujah and Ramadi were strongholds of Sunni insurgents during the US-led war. In a speech in Baghdad, prime minister Nouri al-Maliki said government forces would press on to clear the province of militants. 'There will be no retreat until we eliminate this gang and rid the people of Anbar of their evil acts,' he said. Sunni Muslim worshippers crowded streets in the city west of Baghdad after violence in nearby Ramadi . 'The people of Anbar asked the government for help, they called us to come to rescue them from terrorists.' Anger was exacerbated over the past week after authorities arrested a senior Sunni politician and dismantled a months-old sit-in in Ramadi. In an attempt to calm the situation, al-Maliki pulled some military out to give local police security duties - a top demand of Sunnis. But after the uprising, the military rushed reinforcements back in - a move supported by allied Sunni tribal fighters. Government official Dhari al-Rishawi said clashes - some of the worst in five years - were still underway, adding militants remain in control of Fallujah and some parts of Ramadi, Anbar's capital.","Police have abandoned city of Fallujah as militants take control .

"A drummer who lost his arm in a freak accident now has a second chance of achieving his dream after being transformed into a ‘cyborg’ musician. Jason Barnes lost his right arm below the elbow two years ago after receiving an electric shock while cleaning a vent hood in a restaurant. Determined to carry on drumming, the student from Atlanta built his own prosthetic device using a brace and some springs that attached to his arm. Scroll down for video... Jason Barnes, a drummer who lost his right arm in a freak accident, says he now has a chance of achieving his dream after being transformed into a 'cyborg' musician . The prosthesis uses a technique called electromyography to pick up on electrical signals in the upper arm muscles. By tensing his biceps, Mr Barnes controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how tightly it grips the drumstick. A second, autonomous drumstick was added to the robot arm. This stick is controlled by its own motor. It also uses a microphone and an accelerometer to sense the rhythm Mr Barnes is playing, as well as music from musicians nearby. A new complementary beat is then produced using an algorithm modelled on the jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. He could bang the drums by moving his elbow up and down, but couldn’t control the speed or bounce of the stick without a wrist or fingers. Despite this, the device helped him enrol at the Atlanta Institute of Music and Media in Georgia, and it’s here that he met Professor Gil Weinberg. Professor Weinberg hatched a plan to create a single-stick device with sensors that respond to Mr Barnes’ bicep muscles. ‘Now I can flex and send signals to a computer that tightens or loosens the stick and controls the rebound,’ Mr Barnes said. The robotic drumming prosthesis has motors that power two drumsticks. The . first stick is controlled both physically by the musicians’ arms and . electronically using electromyography (EMG) muscle sensors. VIDEO: Jason Barnes' superhuman skills . By tensing his biceps, Mr Barnes . controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how . tightly it grips the drumstick. The other stick ‘listens’ to the music being played and improvises. This stick is controlled by its own motor. It also uses a microphone and an accelerometer to sense the rhythm Mr Barnes is playing, as well as music from musicians nearby. A . new complementary beat is then produced using an algorithm modelled on . the jazz musicians such as John Coltrane and Thelonious Monk. ‘The second drumstick has a mind of its own,’ said Professor Weinberg, founding director of the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology. ‘The drummer essentially becomes a cyborg. It’s interesting to see him playing and improvising with part of his arm that he doesn’t totally control.’ Professor Weinberg had previously built a robotic percussionist and marimba player that use computer algorithms to improvise with human musicians. The prosthesis uses a technique called electromyography to pick up on electrical signals in the arm muscles. By tensing his biceps, Mr Barnes controls a motor that changes how quick the prosthetic arm moves and how tightly it grips the drumstick . But this prosthesis took his work a step further by adding a ‘musical brain’ into the second drum. ‘Jason can pull the robotic stick away from the drum when he wants to be fully in control,’ explained Professor Weinberg. ‘Or he can allow it to play on its own and be surprised and inspired by his own arm responding to his drumming.’ The new prosthetic has already given Mr Barnes capabilities he hasn’t had since before the amputation. Professor Weinberg is now using a National Science Foundation grant to further develop the technology. ‘Music is very time sensitive. You can hear the difference between two strokes, even if they are a few milliseconds apart,’ said Professor Weinberg. The robotic drumming prosthesis was created by Professor Gil Weinberg (left) from the Georgia Tech Center for Music Technology in Atlanta. Jason Barnes (right) said: 'I'll bet a lot of metal drummers might be jealous of what I can do now' ‘If we are able to use machine learning from Jason’s muscles to determine when he intends to drum and have the stick hit at that moment, both arms can be synchronised.’ He added that such robotic synchronisation technology could potentially be used in the future to control an embedded, mechanical third arm during time-sensitive operations. For example, Professor Weinberg’s algorithms could be used to help astronauts or surgeons perform complex, physical tasks alongside robotic devices. For Mr Barnes, the robot arm has transformed his skills. Because an embedded chip can control the speed of the drumsticks, the prosthesis can be programmed to play two sticks at a different rhythm. It can also move the sticks faster than humanly possible. ‘I’ll bet a lot of metal drummers might be jealous of what I can do now,’ he said. ‘Speed is good. Faster is always better.’","Jason Barnes from Atlanta lost his right arm below elbow 2 years ago .

"Parents are putting their children at risk by ‘conniving’ with them to get on Facebook, David Cameron’s adviser on family issues has warned. Reg Bailey, the chief executive of the Mothers’ Union, attacked the ‘complicity of parents’ who allow their young children to use social networking sites which are supposed to be for the over-13s. It has led to the alarming situation where about 60 per cent of nine to 12-year-olds have a social media presence, putting them in danger of being groomed by paedophiles or targeted with inappropriate advertising. Concerns: Parents are putting their children at risk by 'conniving' with them to get on Facebook, David Cameron's adviser on family issues has warned. This picture is posed by a model . Mr Bailey, who wrote a high-profile report on the sexualisation of children for the Prime Minister in 2011, said he was worried about the example such parents were  setting about ‘honesty’. It came as a survey of more than 2,000 parents showed that 34 per cent do not believe it is their responsibility to teach their children about being safe online. The report, by Plymouth University and technology firm AVG,  also indicated that parents are in the dark about what their teenage children get up to online. Speaking out: Reg Bailey, the chief executive of the Mothers' Union, pictured, attacked the 'complicity of parents' who allow their young children to use social networking sites which are supposed to be for the over-13s . Some 85 per cent said their children had not looked at porn online, even though NSPCC evidence shows the majority of 14-year-old boys have accessed such content. Mr Bailey made his hard-hitting comments at a summit on child internet safety in London which was sponsored by Disney – after both Google and Facebook declined to take part. The Mothers’ Union boss said: ‘One of the problems I have is with the complicity of parents. 'With social networking sites, the minimum age is 13, and yet getting on for 60 per cent of children under the age of 13 have a social network presence. 'This is sometimes with the tacit acceptance of parents and sometimes the active connivance of their parents. It worries me about what sort of message you’re sending children about honesty.’ Mr Bailey told the Mail that many parents let their children go on Facebook and other sites because their friends are on them and they do not want them to get left out. ‘The problem with this is that if the child is eight years old but they claim to be 13 to get online, the site is constantly assuming they are five years older than they are,’ said Mr Bailey. ‘So when they get to 13, the site is assuming they are 18 and can then be targeted with advertising aimed at 18-year-olds, including gambling sites, drink and so on.’ The summit at London’s QE2 Conference Centre was sponsored by Disney’s Club Penguin, an internet site used by more than 1million children each month. Worrying: Many parents let their children go on Facebook and other sites because their friends are on them and they do not want their children to be left out . But conference producer Aisha Tilstone said Facebook and Google declined an offer to sponsor the event or take part. She said: ‘We struggled to secure sponsorship from Facebook and Google for the summit, despite telling them they would be communicating directly to teachers and parents. For me, their lack of representation speaks volumes.’ Lucy Woodward, head of Club Penguin in Europe, said: ‘For parents, internet safety needs to be one of those life skills they need to pass on to their children, like teaching them to cross the road.’","Reg Bailey attacked parents who allow children on social networking sites .

"Murdered Miss Honduras Maria Jose Alvaro was killed as she tried to defend her elder sister by shielding her with her own body, it emerged today. The Miss World contestant, 19, is believed to have selflessly thrown herself on top of her sister Sofia, 23, as she lay wounded after being shot first. Sofia's boyfriend Plutarco Antonio Ruiz, 29, is accused of killing the sisters in a fit of jealousy after seeing his girlfriend dance with another man at a party at an upmarket spa resort. Police this week revealed that beauty queen Maria, who would have been in London today competing in the Miss World Pageant, died after being shot twice in the back. Her mother  said the beauty queen was particularly excited to compete for the title in the UK because she thought this would be an opportunity for her to meet the brother she never knew, who lives in Germany. Until now it had been reported that Maria was running away from her killer after seeing her sister gunned down when she was fatally shot. But a source close to police investigating the murder told MailOnline she had in fact instinctively thrown her body on top of her sister's to try to protect her from the gunman. Scroll down for video . So close: Sisters Maria, right, and Sofia, left were at a party for Sofia's boyfriend when they were killed. Sources today said Maria died as she tried to shield her wounded elder sister . Unbreakable bond: The two sisters, Maria, left, and Sofia, right, were so close that when Sofia was shot her sister threw her body on top of her and started screaming at alleged killer Plutarco Antonio Ruiz . Plutarco Antonio Ruiz grins chillingly into the camera while being led to jail as he is detained for the murders of Miss Honduras beauty queen Maria Jose, 19, and her sister Sofia Alvarado, 23 . The sisters' heartbroken mother Teresa Muñoz showed MailOnline childhood photos of her daughter Maria Jose, pictured above . The source said: 'Sofia had told her boyfriend that she and her sister wanted to leave the party and go back to their home, and this sparked an argument. 'He ended up pulling out a pistol and shooting her. 'Instead of running away Maria Jose lay on top of her sister's body to try to shield her. She started to shout and scream at the boyfriend and he shot her too.' The source said that police were investigating the possibility that both sisters were killed with the same fatal bullet. Speaking about Maria's plans to compete for Miss World, Mrs Muñoz said her daughter thought the exposure would help her meet the brother she never knew, which had always been her dream. She said her daughter told her that this was finally her chance to meet him and she wasn't going to waste it. It is also understood that three other people are accused of helping Ruiz cover up the crime. As well as his friend Aris Maldonado, police claim that the owner of the Aguagua spa resort, Ventura Diaz Ponce, and his wife Elisabeth Alvarado Bajera, helped move the women's bodies away from the complex and bury them in a nearby river bank. If convicted, all four accused could be sentenced to 30 to 40 years in jail. Meanwhile the 'confessed killer' of the murdered Miss Honduras beauty queen smiled chillingly into the camera on his way to the cells last night, as his victims' grieving mother warned that the suspect's family will try to buy his freedom. Teresa Muñoz told MailOnline she feared that Plutarco Antonio Ruiz, detained for the murders of Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado, will never be brought to justice in a country where corruption is rampant. The bodies of the two sisters were found buried in a river bank near the spa where they had disappeared a week earlier. Police believe Sofia's boyfriend Ruiz shot her in the head in a jealous rage, before shooting Maria Jose twice in the back. They say he has confessed to the deaths. Mrs Munoz, who buried her two children near their hometown of Santa Barbara yesterday, warned that bribes for suspects are common as police sent four suspects to jail. Elizabeth Alvarado (left), is escorted to testify before a judge for her possible involvement as an accomplice to the killing of the two sisters which Ruiz (right) confessed to on Tuesday . Mrs Munoz (right) told MailOnline she feared her daughters' killer will never be brought to justice in a country where corruption is rampant . The bodies were recovered after being found buried near a river bank close the spa where they disappeared . Suspected accomplice Aris Maldonado was arrested on Tuesday alongside 32-year-old Ruiz, while spa owner Ventura Diaz and his wife Elizabeth Alvarado were arrested the next day for allegedly burying the bodies. Despite being under investigation, after his arrest Maldonado managed to post a message on Facebook  protesting his innocence. It stated: 'Thanks to the people who are with me at this difficult and unjust moment in my life. Tabloid newspapers invent everything but I have faith in God and know everything will turn out okay.' Clasping two family albums, Mrs Munoz sat with friends as she showed MailOnline childhood photos of the sisters and talked about her daughters. She said that someone had told her one of her daughters would become a model, she would have guessed Sofia because her elder daughter was always more of an extrovert while Maria Jose was more timid. But she believes that Maria Jose's status as a model and beauty queen is the only reason the deaths are being taken seriously. 'I believe that if my daughter had not been a representative of her country, her death wouldn't have brought any justice,' she said. Jose Luis Mejia, director of the Technological University campus in Santa Barbara, where Maria studied, agreed that the deaths would not have become a national outrage if it had not been for the model's standing. 'If she had been any other girl, if she hadn't been Miss Honduras, this would have been one more crime amid the impunity of Honduras,' he said. 'They would have said what they always do: that this was the settling of accounts between drug traffickers, and they wouldn't even have bothered to investigate.' San Pedro Sula, just over 30 miles from Santa Barbara where the girls were murdered, is the murder capital of the world with more than 1,200 killings a year among its nearly one million inhabitants. Beauty queen Maria Jose Alvarado, 19, was due to compete in this year's Miss World competition in London . Mrs Munoz said that someone had told her one of her daughters would become a model, she would have guessed Sofia because her elder daughter was always more of an extrovert while Maria Jose was more timid . Mrs Munoz tried to smile as she spoke about her two daughters,  Maria Jose (left) and Sofia (right) before warning of her fears that their killer might never be brought to justice if his family try to buy his freedom . The youngest of three sisters, Alvarado began competing in beauty pageants at age 13. She won Miss Northwest Honduras, Miss Teen Honduras and, finally, Miss Honduras, the stepping stone to the Miss World pageant. After each competition, she would come back to Santa Barbara and share the details of her experiences with friends . 'Her successes were our successes,' said schoolmate Ludin Reyes. 'We were friends and fans.' While Alvarado pursued her dream, and her oldest sister married and moved away. She was a teacher until the school where she worked closed, and in love with a married man who left his wife to be with her, before he was murdered in October 2013. Pageant queen: Sofia, pictured left, invited her younger sister Maria Jose, right, to the party where she was shot dead. The youngest of three sisters, Maria began competing in beauty pageants at age 13. She won Miss Northwest Honduras, Miss Teen Honduras and, finally, Miss Honduras, the stepping stone to the Miss World pageant . Sofia's new boyfriend Ruiz was known about town as a man to be feared from a family deeply involved in drug trafficking, officials say. Although he had no police record, he was seen as someone who could offer protection or eliminate enemies. 'This is a drug trafficking corridor,' said Lt. Col Ramon Castillo, an army officer in charge of security in Santa Barbara. 'David Ruiz, Plutarco's brother was 'the bull' and when he was killed in February, Plutarco took his place. ... Plutarco is a violent person with a bad character and he solves everything with a pistol in his hand.' Police say Ruiz shot Sofia because she was dancing with another man. After a fierce argument, he pulled out a pistol and fired at Sofia first, then Maria as she tried to flee.

General Ramon Sabillon, the National Police director, said  Ruiz had confessed to the killings on Tuesday and led authorities to the bodies in a mountainous area in Santa Barbara. It is a mystery to Maria's friends why she went with her sister to the rundown 'spa,' or riverfront restaurant, that was believed to be a place that Ruiz used to conduct illegal business. But Alvarado looked up to her big sister and, after baking a cake together, apparently wanted to join Sofia to celebrate Ruiz's birthday on November 13. The day after the party, Ruiz told the sisters's family the women had left the with someone else, and he invited them for lunch. Later, he even went with them to file a missing persons report with police. Maria's body, wrapped in brown plastic, was loaded into the back of a pickup truck just hours before she was to have boarded a flight to London to compete in the Miss World pageant. A winner will be crowned on December 14.","Plutarco Antonio Ruiz is detained for killing Maria Jose and Sofia Alvarado .

"A giraffe has died after smashing its head into a low bridge while it was being transported along a busy highway in South Africa. The moments before the accident at around 2.30pm today were caught on camera by a horrified fellow driver who described hearing a loud crack. South Africa's Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals told local media the giraffe has since died and the truck driver could face criminal charges. Scroll down for video . Horror: This photograph was taken on the N1 highway in Pretoria, South Africa, moments before one of the two giraffes hit its head a low bridge (pictured) and later died. Animal cruelty officers are investigating the incident . Engineer Thinus Botha, 32, took the photo of the two giraffes after driving next to the truck for half a mile on the N1 on the outskirts of Pretoria, South Africa's capital. He decided to pull over to capture the moment - and witnessed the gruesome accident seconds later. 'I pulled over just before the bridge and a few seconds after I took the photo the first giraffe hit its head on the bridge,' he told MailOnline. 'There was a loud bang and I saw blood coming from the nose of the giraffe. 'I hear that he didn't make it and I'm not surprised. It was a sharp hit to his skull.' Some Twitter users pointed out the similarities with the film The Hangover Part III, which features lead character Alan Garner causing a 20-car pileup after accidentally decapitating a giraffe he bought. But South Africa's Society for the Prevention of cruelty to Animals said the real-life incident was deadly serious and the driver could be prosecuted. Some Twitter users pointed out bizarre similarities with the film The Hangover Part III. But animal protection officers said the incident had caused the animal catastrophic head injuries and the driver could be prosecuted . Other reactions to the incident on Twitter, where the photo was first posted, were distraught. Liesl Schoonraad wrote: 'Sometimes I have no hope for mankind', while Nikki Botha wrote: 'This makes me see a special shade of red.' @Itschydo added: 'How was the giraffe supposed to know to duck its head?!' It is believed the truck had already broken down this morning, leaving the giraffes stranded for several hours. The driver was then stopped at a toll booth further up the road, said Mr Botha. The owner of the giraffes told a reporter for the national Citizen newspaper that the truck 'went through lots of other bridges' before the accident and the giraffe had craned its neck. But Mr Botha told MailOnline: 'He was standing as he is in the picture. He didn't all of a sudden stand up straighter or stretch.' SPCA spokesman Rick Allan told Eye Witness News: 'All we can ascertain at this stage is severe head trauma. 'We are continuing our investigation with the view to possibly lay criminal charges against those responsible.'","Animal transported today on main highway in South African capital Pretoria .

"We're constantly being told to floss, rinse and brush our teeth in a certain way. And even the experts can't decide the best way to clean our gnashers, according to a new report. Now, however, a professor of dentistry claims to have come up with the definitive answer - and it's a lot easier than you might think. Scroll down for video . A simple, gentle scrub was found to be 'perfectly effective' at keeping teeth and gums healthy, rather than any complicated techniques . A simple, gentle scrub was found to be ‘perfectly effective’ at keeping gums healthy, say researchers from University College London. A horizontal brushing motion, with the brush held like a pencil at a 45 degree angle, is sufficient to access dental plaque, they add. In fact, there is little point in getting to grips with elaborate brushing techniques - or in cleaning your teeth hours after eating sweets or consuming a sugary drink - because acid is produced within two minutes of the first bite or sip. The researchers was prompted by the wealth of conflicting advice from dentists, dental associations, toothbrush and toothpaste manufacturers on the ideal way to brush. Professor Sheiham advises people to: ‘Brush gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing motion, with the brush at a forty-five degree angle to get to the dental plaque. ‘To avoid brushing too hard, hold the brush with a pencil grip rather than a fist. This simple method is perfectly effective at keeping your gums healthy. Dentist Dr John Wainwright, who carried out the study, said: ‘I advise my patients to focus their brushing on areas where plaque is most likely to collect - the biting surfaces and where the teeth and gums meet - and to use a gentle scrubbing motion.' Aubrey Sheiham, Emeritus Professor of Dental Public Health, said the advice on how we should brush is ‘unacceptably inconsistent'. ‘The public needs to have sound information on the best method to brush their teeth,' he said. ‘If people hear one thing from a dental association, another from a toothbrush company and something else from their dentist, no wonder they are confused about how to brush. ‘In this study we found an unacceptably inconsistent array of advice from different sources. ‘Dental associations need to be consistent about what method to recommend, based on how effective the method is. ‘Most worryingly, the methods recommended by dental associations are not the same as the best ones mentioned in dental textbooks. ‘There is no evidence to suggest that complicated techniques are any better than a simple gentle scrub.’ According to the study, which was published in the British Dental Journal, the most commonly-recommended technique involves gently jiggling the brush back and forth in small motions, with the intention of shaking loose any food particles, plaque and bacteria. But no study has showed whether this is as effective as basic scrubbing, he said. Professor Sheiham advised people to: ‘Brush gently with a simple horizontal scrubbing motion, with the brush at a 45 degree angle to get to the dental plaque. ‘To avoid brushing too hard, hold the . brush with a pencil grip rather than a fist. This simple method is . perfectly effective at keeping your gums healthy. Experts say the advice on how to best care for our teeth is 'unacceptably inconsistent' ‘There is little point in brushing after eating sweets or sugary drinks to prevent tooth decay. It takes bacteria from food about two minutes to start producing acid, so if you brush your teeth a few minutes after eating sugary foods, the acid will have damaged the enamel. Dentist Dr John Wainwright, who carried out the study, said: ‘The wide range of recommendations we found is likely due to the lack of strong evidence suggesting that one method is conclusively better than another. ‘I advise my patients to focus their brushing on areas where plaque is most likely to collect - the biting surfaces and where the teeth and gums meet - and to use a gentle scrubbing motion. ‘All too frequently I am asked why the method I am describing differs from how previous dentists have taught them in the past. ‘For something most people do twice a day, you would expect dentists to send a clearer, more unified message to their patients on how to brush their teeth.’","University College London experts criticised conflicting brushing advice .

"Firebrand U.S. talkshow host Glenn Beck has accused the Associated Press news agency of 'raping' Bill Crosby after it published an interview in which it asks him about claims he sexually assaulted more than a dozen women. The AP published the interview on Wednesday in which the comedian refuses to comment on the allegations. But he is later recorded asking the reporter to 'scuttle' that part of the interview. And today, Conservative loudmouth and former Fox News host Beck, 49, defended the comedian in a 15-minute rant on his eponymous radio show, declaring, 'You want to talk about rape? That's media rape right there.' Scroll down for video . Outrage: Firebrand talkshow host Glenn Beck (left) accused the Associated Press of 'raping' Bill Crosby after it published an interview in which its reporter asks him about the sex-assault allegations engulfing him (right) Referring to the AP's question, he went on: 'You said you would not [ask] that. Since when does your 'no' mean 'yes'? Do you know the definition of 'no,' sir? You've just raped Bill Cosby. You said you wouldn't do it. You just did it and then you blamed it on him. My gosh, maybe we should have a lesson on rape.' At the end of the interview, on November 6, Cosby tells the interviewer: 'We thought, because it was AP, that it wouldn't be necessary to go over that question with you. 'Tell your boss the reason why we didn't say that upfront was because we thought ... the AP had the integrity to not ask.' First response: On Wednesday, the AP published an interview in which a reporter asked Cosby to respond to allegations that he's raped more than a dozen women . 'Scuttled': Appearing alongside wife Camille, the comedian refused to comment on the allegations, but is later recorded asking the reporter to 'scuttle' that part of the interview . But the AP concluded by saying: 'The interview was on record. The AP made no agreement to avoid questions about the allegations or to withhold publishing any of his comments at any time.' The interview took place on November 6 following a string of allegations by women claiming he had drugged and raped them. Five women have come forward in the past month and claimed that they were drugged and raped by Cosby, four of them when they were teenagers. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. The other four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Talking about rape: Conservative loudmouth and former Fox News host Beck, 49, defended the comedian in a 15-minute rant on his eponymous radio show, declaring, 'You want to talk about rape? That's media rape right there.' Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredibly Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her at a part at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.' These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star. Cosby has also had scheduled appearances on talk shows including The Queen Latifah Show and Late Night With David Letterman cancelled in the wake of these allegations. TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network.

"An Idaho man man used a shotgun to kill his longtime girlfriend and one of her five children before using the same weapon to kill himself, a preliminary investigation shows. Twin Falls County Prosecutor Grant Loebs says autopsy reports have not been finalized from the Nov. 15 deaths but the early investigation has found only the single weapon. Police say 36-year-old George Salinas likely killed 38-year-old LeAnn Schuldies and her 17-year-old daughter, Brianna Cox, before ending his life. Their bodies were found in a Twin Falls County home. Four other children, ages 6, 7, 9 and 13 survived. They're believed to be Salinas' children with Schuldies. Victims: LeAnn Schuldies (left) died alongside her 17-year-old Brianna Cox in Idaho. Police believe they were shot by Schuldies' longtime boyfriend George Salinas, who then killed himself . Schuldies was a well-liked bartender in Twin Falls. She had an order of protection against Salinas and was trying to end her relationship with him when she and her daughter were killed. Schuldies' four surviving children are staying with family. Salinas was not Cox's father. County court records show that on Nov. 5, Schuldies obtained a two-week 'no-contact' order against Salinas for herself and her children. On Nov. 12, she got a second order against him that extended past a court hearing planned for Friday. 'She was trying to get out of that relationship and move on with her life with her kids,' said her co-worker and friend Hannah Zamora, a manager at restaurant and bar Elevation 486. Schuldies leaves behind four surviving children ages 6, 7, 9 and 13 . Police say George Salinas shot Schuldies and one of her five children before killing himself . 'Obviously, it was just paper to him. It wasn't anything that stopped him. It didn't seem like she had the help that she needed.' Zamora said she knew Schuldies for six years and, six months ago, helped her land a job at Elevation 486, where she worked as a bartender and where at least one other company tried to hire her away. 'Everybody loved her,' Zamora said. 'She was very warmhearted. She never showed what was going on in her life. She was always happy and smiling, always thinking of others.' But Zamora said Schuldies did share some of her problems — including her plans to end her relationship with Salinas — with a select few. 'She was tired of everything,' Zamora said. 'So she stood up for herself and her kids.' Elevation 486 closed for the day Saturday after workers learned of Schuldies' death. Employees since have created a link on the restaurant's Facebook page for those wishing to make a donation for Schuldies' surviving children. The restaurant overlooks the Snake River Canyon, a view Schuldies enjoyed, even during a snowstorm. 'On Friday I remember her saying, ""Hannah, turn around and look at the snowflakes,""' Zamora said.","Investigators say George Salinas, 36, used a shotgun to kill LeAnn Schuldies, 38, and her daughter Brianna Cox, 17, before shooting himself .

"It could be any picture-postcard image of a family playing happily on the beach. But moments after this photograph was taken, these four boys were dead - wiped out by an Israeli shell as they ran for their lives. The children were killed in Gaza yesterday as more than 100,000 Palestinians were urged to evacuate their homes ahead of a possible ground offensive and new air attacks. A second picture also emerged on Twitter that is believed to show a different view of the boys as they scrambled across the sand. Scroll down for video . Haunting: This picture has emerged showing four Palestinian boys from the same family running on a beach in Gaza moments before they were killed by an Israeli shell . Harrowing: This image posted on Twitter is believed to show a different view of three of the boys running along the beach . Officials said the boys were members . of a well-known local fishing family and died in shelling from an . Israeli gunboat off Gaza’s Mediterranean coast that also injured several . others, including another child. They . were named as Ahed Bakr, aged 10, Zakaria, 10, and two other boys from . the Bakr family, both named Mohammad, aged 11 and nine. The boys’ uncle, Abdel Kareem Baker, 41, described it as ‘a cold blooded massacre’ and mocked Israel’s use of advanced technology in failing to identify children playing. Witnesses told how shells had hit the beach and then a pier strutting into the sea as a group of injured men and boys tried to flee to safety.

A graphic showing where the boys were killed by an Israeli gunboat off Gaza's Mediterranean coast and explaining how Israel's missile defence system works . While the boys were killed on the beach, several others were hit as they ran near tents and chairs set out on the beach area. The . pictures emerged as Israel began firing shells at what it calls 'terror targets' inside the Gaza Strip within 20 minutes of the UN-brokered ceasefire ending. Palestinian militants responded by launching their homemade rockets across the border into southern Israel. Earlier, the Israeli army said three mortar shells fired from Gaza hit southern Israel today just over two hours after the ceasefire took effect. Police had said two rockets fell in open areas in southern Israel, causing no damage or injuries, two hours after the ceasefire began. It came after Israel and Hamas started observing a five-hour humanitarian ceasefire following a request by the United Nations so supplies could be delivered to Gaza. Grieving: Palestinian mourners carry the bodies of three of the four members of the al-Astal family, who were killed by an Israeli airstrike in the Gaza Strip . Fighting resumes: Within 20 minutes of the UN-brokered ceasefire ending, Israel began firing shells at what is calls 'terror targets' inside the Gaza Strip. Palestinian militants responded by launching their homemade rockets across the border into southern Israel . Rush: Palestinians hurry to withdraw money from a bank that has been closed for the past 10 days so they can buy food, water and other supplies during the five-hour halt in Israeli shelling . Fighting had continued in the lead-up to the start of the ceasefire. Police in the southern Gaza town of Rafah said tank shells landed on a house, killing at least three civilians. The Israeli military said 15 rockets were fired into Israel this morning. It also said it prevented an attack by 13 militants who infiltrated Israel through a tunnel from Gaza. The cross-border fighting has so far killed more than 220 Palestinians and an Israeli, according to officials. Despite the apparent eagerness to . resume fighting after today's UN-brokered ceasefire expired, there is still hope that a permanent Egypt-brokered ceasefire . could come into place early tomorrow morning. Negotiations are ongoing in Cairo to bring the 10-day conflict to a close - although both sides this afternoon denied reports that a deal had already been struck. Earlier an unnamed Israeli official had claimed senior government representatives had accepted the Egyptian proposal, but said it still had to be approved by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's decision-making security cabinet before coming in to place tomorrow at 06:00 local time (04:00 BST). But Israel's foreign minister Avigdor Lieberman this afternoon branded the official's claims 'as of now incorrect'. Senior figures within Hamas also confirmed that a conclusion had not been reached and said talks are ongoing. The Israeli army says say it foiled a 'major' terrorist attack on a small village close to the border with Gaza this morning, just hours before a 'humanitarian' ceasefire was due to begin. A group of 13 militants suffered a direct hit from an airstrike just seconds before they planned to climb into a purpose-built tunnel leading from the Palestinian territory into the village of Kibbutz Sufa, which is very close to the Israeli border with both Gaza and Egypt. Residents of Kibbutz Sufa were told to stay indoors for several hours after the confrontation - raw footage of which was later posted on Live Leak - as it was not clear if all the militants had been killed, or whether some made it into the tunnel and still posed a threat. Attack: A group of 13 militants suffered a direct hit from an airstrike just seconds before they planned to climb into a purpose-built tunnel leading from inside the Palestinian territory into the village of Kibbutz Sufa, which is very close to the Israeli border with both Gaza and Egypt . Plot: On its website, Hamas' military wing claimed responsibility for the thwarted attack, saying its special forces had actually gone beyond 'enemy lines near Sufa', and had only come under fire from the Israeli military after the 'completion of its mission' The thwarted attack came just hours before the start of a five-hour 'humanitarian' ceasefire - agreed to by Hamas and brokered by the United Nations - which Israel said would allow Palestinians to stock up on food and water supplies, and withdraw money from banks before shelling resumed. On its website, Hamas' military wing claimed responsibility for the attack, saying its special forces had actually gone beyond 'enemy lines near Sufa', and had only come under fire from the Israeli military after the 'completion of its mission'. The statement did not explain what that mission had been. Under fire: The Israeli army suggested they had been watching the men for some time, and launched an attack before they were able to get into the tunnel. It said it had deployed aircraft and other forces to block the infiltration . Blast: The thwarted attack came just hours before the start of a five-hour 'humanitarian' ceasefire agreed to by Hamas and brokered by the United Nations . Hamas also claimed that all of the militants involved in the attack returned to Gaza safely. The Israeli army contradicted both of those claims, suggesting they had been watching the men for some time, and launched an attack before they were able to climb into the tunnel. It said it had deployed aircraft and other forces to block the infiltration.

"A Miami suburb has been named as the 'bidet capital of America' thanks to new research which reveals homes in the town are 50 times more likely to have one of the unpopular fixtures than the national average. According to real estate website Zumper, people living in Sunny Isles Beach in Miami are also 30 times more likely to have a bidet, which is a small basin used to wash your derriere, than those living in New York. And it's not just Sunny Isles Beach; Zumper's list of America's top ten bidet cities features four other Florida-based locations, including Aventura, which comes in a close second, and Fort Lauderdale, which places eighth. To bidet or not to bidet? While the bathroom fixture (R) is often found in homes in Sunny Isles Beach, elsewhere in America they are incredibly unpopular . Bidet map of America: Five of the top ten bidet cities are in Florida . 'This amounts to a bidet cluster,'  Anthemos Georgiades, CEO of Zumper, explained. 'Probably America's only one.' Florida's apparent love of the hygienic bathroom fixture goes against the popular belief that bidets have no place in the United States. While the country is often praised as one of the most hygienic countries in the world, bidets have never been seen as a popular household feature - despite their overwhelming popularity in much of Continental Europe. 1.

Overland Park, KS . 'In around 90% of the some 200 U.S. cities on Zumper, not a single apartment mentions having a bidet,' Mr Georgiades added. 'So, we're talking in the American context of a pretty niche amenity. 'There may seem to be something un-American about bidets. But there seems something less un-Floridian about them.' Indeed, the only state which comes close to rivaling Florida's bidet dominance is Maryland, which has three cities - Midford, Newton and Somerville - in the top ten list of Bidet cities. 'Many Americans may not be certain what bidets are for,' Mr Georgiades said of the bidet's unpopularity. So, what explains their relative popularity in Sunny Isles Beach? Mr Georgiades is unsure. 'Maybe it's a way to cope with all the sand?' he speculated. 'Or maybe they just took the fancy of certain local architects or developers.'","According to new research, Sunny Isles Beach, Miami is the top bidet city in the country, with 50 times as many as the national average ."
"Parents should insist on seeing their children’s texts and internet exchanges, David Cameron’s new adviser on childhood urged last night. Claire Perry said that in a world where youngsters are surrounded by online dangers, parents should challenge the ‘bizarre’ idea that their children have the right to keep their messages private. In her first interview since being appointed last month, the 48-year-old mother of three added that society as a whole has been ‘complicit’ in allowing a culture where youngsters can make inappropriate contact with strangers at all hours of the day and night. Parents should feel more empowered to challenge their children over their phone and internet usage and read their messages . Mrs Perry said ‘sexting’ – where . children send each other explicit images of themselves – went on in . ‘pretty much every school in the country’. She . said parents should feel ‘empowered’ to challenge their offspring about . their use of mobile phones and social media sites such as Facebook, and . demand to look at their messages if necessary. The . Tory MP for Devizes added that parents had to take clearer . responsibility for internet access on their children’s laptops and . mobile phones. ‘So many people say “I have got children on their laptop at 2am – what do I do?” Well, turn the router off when you go to bed,’ she said. Mrs Perry set out a range of proposals in her new role as David Cameron’s adviser on the sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood. They include: . On the issue of children’s texts and internet exchanges, Mrs Perry said: ‘We’ve given our children all these opportunities to communicate in private, but we’ve lost the confidence to actually get involved in that. 'We have to feel more empowered to ask. Make sure your kids allow you to be friends with them on Facebook, ask them whether what they are doing is appropriate. The MP wants internet safety taught in the classroom and says 'sexting' goes on in 'pretty much every school in the country' ‘We have got to be much franker, much more open and upfront about it. I don’t want it to sound like harking back to Victorian values, but parents should sit down with their kids and say “are you aware of what’s out there?”.’ Mrs Perry was appointed by Mr Cameron after leading a successful campaign for an ‘opt-in’ system for online porn in households with children. She told the Daily Mail she was concerned about a broader, growing ‘clash between family values and technology’. ‘In a way we have all been complicit. We can’t say it’s all government’s responsibility, or industry’s or parents’ – we have got to work together,’ she said. ‘When you and I were growing up the idea your parents would allow you to communicate daily with strangers, that you would have letters or phone calls coming into your home, would have been bizarre. ‘Yet we have now given our kids the space to be private with their phones and internet connections. ‘This whole issue of peer-to-peer contact is very difficult. You can’t filter it using technology. Parents are not monitoring it and we don’t feel we should. I said to my daughter, “perhaps I should read your texts” and she looked at me like I was insane. I thought, “well actually I am paying for it”.’ Rallying call: Claire Perry said society is 'complicit' in allowing a culture where children can contact strangers day and night . Mrs Perry said the latest evidence suggested the level of ‘sexting’ was ‘absolutely horrific’. Last week, an inquest heard how Chevonea Kendall-Bryan, a 13-year-old South London schoolgirl, fell to her death from a block of flats after begging a boy on the pavement below to delete a sex video of her on his phone. ‘It is usually girls who are on the receiving end of some pretty degrading stuff,’ the MP said. ‘We’ve got young girls being asked to write their names on their boobs and send pictures. Parents would be really shocked to know this is happening in pretty much every school in the country. Our children are growing up in a very sexualised world.’ Mrs Perry suggested there should be a simple, well-advertised system for parents and children to report harmful or inappropriate contacts. On children’s internet access via laptops and mobile phones, she said: ‘Less than 40 per cent of families have downloaded filters onto their internet-enabled devices. Some of that is due to ignorance, some of it time pressure,’ she said. ‘If you ask parents where children learn about internet safety, the majority say at school. Yes, schools have got a role to play. But we have got to be prepared as parents to talk to our kids about these things. It’s difficult and it’s challenging but it’s right. ‘You can set time limits, block surfing at particular hours, block access to different websites. There is . an innovation and sophistication around controls. But ultimately, you can turn off children’s access to the internet.’ Mrs Perry said there was a case for re-examining the school curriculum so that internet safety is included in IT lessons. She was also ‘really concerned’ about ‘completely lewd’ music videos that are not currently age-rated. ‘We aren’t in the business of saying we want to stop Rihanna gyrating around,’ she said. ‘But it’s not right that someone of any age can click online and see it. Parents should be able to say they don’t want their children watching this stuff. It’s not about censorship. But films are age-rated and it should be the same in the online world. Let’s adopt a new system of classification using the British Film Classification Board. That won’t mean more spending and regulation.’ On ‘lads’ mags’, Mrs Perry said she regarded them as ‘appalling and demeaning’, adding: ‘I can’t understand why anyone would ever pose for them.’ Claire Perry is one of the  Conservative party’s rising stars, having only been elected in 2010. The 48-year-old mother-of-three lives near Salisbury, Wiltshire, and grew up in North Somerset. After attending her local comprehensive school she went to Brasenose College, Oxford, where she read geography. A career in banking followed, but after three years, in 1990, she studied for an MBA at Harvard Business School. After jobs with McKinsey and Credit Suisse, Mrs Perry gave up work in 2000 to raise her children, but carried on fundraising for local schools and hospitals. She joined the Conservative Party in 2006, and was asked to work for Shadow Chancellor George Osborne as a special adviser the following year. In 2010 she was picked to represent the safe Conservative seat of Devizes, which she won with a 13,000 majority. She said a report to the Prime Minister by Mother’s Union boss Reg Bailey, due to be updated within the next few weeks, had recommended that such magazines should not be displayed at children’s eye level, but there had been only ‘patchy progress’. She also said the culture of airbrushing celebrity photos was ‘very damaging’. ‘There’s huge, huge pressure on young girls. I’m a mother of two daughters and I can see the pressures to look thin and beautiful,’ she added. Mrs Perry said she supported those calling for airbrushed images to be labelled to make it clear they have been digitally enhanced. She said she was prepared to be branded ‘the Mary Whitehouse of the 2010s’ by some critics of her new role and had already attracted a ‘crowd of hateful Twitter followers’. But she insisted: ‘When I am finished I want Britain to be absolutely leading the world in online child safety.’","Claire Perry said parents must view children's texts and internet exchanges .

"She was blasted during the 2011 season of X Factor by Simon Cowell who said it looked as if she'd had  five gallons of hair spray spritzed onto her tresses before standing in the middle of a hurricane. Never one to take Cowell's criticism lying down, Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has returned to top sartorial form on this year's show - and she has a carefully curated 'dream team' of experts to thank. One of the most important is Paul Percival - one half of hair styling power duo, Percy & Reed. Their client list includes Sophie Dahl, Diane Kruger, Agyness Deyn, Anna Friel - and now Cheryl. Only the best for Chez: Cheryl Fernandez-Versini has called on Paul Percival, a fashion favourite and celebrity hairdresser, to work his magic on her X Factor hair . Paul, who also tends to the tresses of Rita Ora and Mark Ronson for their VIP appearances and magazine shoots, works backstage with the singer every weekend and is on hand between takes. His signature clean, modern style has made him a backstage fashion week favourite and Cheryl has benefited. Cheryl, who, according to Paul, is very much involved in the creative process, opted to channel French actress and model Brigitte Bardot on Sunday night's show. Speaking about the 60s style chignon she sported, Paul said: 'For Cheryl's look, we decided to complement her beautiful structured dress with a modern twist on my hair hero Brigitte Bardot's iconic style.' Get the look: Cheryl, who is heavily involved in her final look, wanted to channel the eternal glamour of French actress and model Brigitte Bardot for her chic Sunday night look . Now and then: Back on 2011's X Factor, right, Simon Cowell described Cheryl's hair as 'the equivalent of five gallons of hair spray and then standing in the middle of a hurricane'. She swiftly called in a new style squad to give her today's look, left . So how can you get the look at home? 'Find your side parting and apply Percy & Reed Abundantly Bouncy Volumising Mousse through damp hair to give bounce and texture before blow-drying the hair with a round brush,' says Paul, sneakily working in a plug for his own brand of haircare. Spot Paul! He works backstage with Cheryl every weekend and is on hand in between takes to ensure her mane is coiffed to perfection . Next, he suggests sectioning off the crown of the head and inserting three large rollers. 'Warm with the hair dryer, mist with L'Oreal Paris Heat Protect Styling Spray in 3 Day Wave and leave until they are completely cold to touch,' he adds. Next, section off hair from behind each ear to the back of the head in a horseshoe shape and mist with some volumising spray before lightly back brushing. He continues: 'Once you have an even padding around the crown gently brush the top layer of hair smooth to cover back brushing. 'Take the remaining hair to one side and secure in a low pony with a hook band. Spray with hairspray to finish.' His top tip? 'When back brushing don't hold the end of the hair too tight as you will break your hair. 'Pull hair down gently all the way to the root to ensure you create a strong base for your style.' Paul, who says he aims to create products with personality and a comfortable salon where egos are left at the door, added: ‘Working with Cheryl is such a pleasure. She is never afraid to try new things and it’s a real collaborative partnership.’","Cheryl, 31, called in a new style squad for this season's X Factor .

"American was frozen this morning, as temperatures plunged below freezing in every single state for the first time this winter. From the mountains of Hawaii to northern Florida, through the frigid Midwest and, unsurprisingly, Alaska, thermometers read 32 degrees or below. The Great Lakes have been the epicenter of the latest rush of winter weather, with parts of upstate New York deluged with an incredible five feet of snow in a matter of hours.. In western New York, authorities were forced to close down the New York State Thruway after snow piled up by the foot overnight. More than three feet of snow has fallen in and around Buffalo, New York. Watertown, New York, has been hit almost as hard. Nearly two feet has piled up in northern Wisconsin. Northern and western Michigan expects one to two feet. Dozens of drivers were stranded and officials declared a state of emergency in Buffalo and the surrounded suburbs. Authorities were enforcing a travel ban and urging residents to stay home, according to the Buffalo News. Scroll down for videos . Piled on: Good Morning America host Gio Benitez showed off thigh-deep snow that had fallen overnight in Buffalo, New York . Stranded: Dozens of motorists were stranded on the New York State Thruway overnight after snow took driver by surprise. Elsewhere in Buffalo, a state of emergency was declared . Bitter cold: Commuters across the country had to bundle up against the brutal temperatures. Here, a woman wears a hat, scarf and hood to protect against temperatures in Philadelphia that hit 21 degrees . Covered: Lake effect snow hammered Buffalo, New York, and the surrounding suburbs - dumping up to five feet between Monday night and Tuesday . Marching on: The wall of snow could be seen from miles away as it brought yet more snow to the pounded city . Almost the entire country is experiencing temperatures well below normal for this time of the year. In the Midwest, South, and Northeast, it's 15 to 25 degrees colder than it should be for mid-November. In Northeast Ohio, temperatures hit record lows for November as wind chills dropped to -8 degrees. Lows in Chicago dropped to 12 degrees with a wind chill of -6. On Monday, parts of Upstate New York experienced thundersnow, the rattling early winter phenomenon, and could see it again. Accuweather meteorologist Tom Kines said big snowfall is contained to a few places experiencing lake effect snow from the Great Lakes. 'Those places that are getting hit by lake effect are measuring snow by feet not inches,' he said. Snow last week ensured that nearly half of the nation is now blanketed in snow - which might not be a record, but it's rare for November, Mr Kines added. The arctic blast is expected to bring temperatures well below freezing as far south as Houston on Tuesday morning. Northern Florida and the southeast have even dropped below freezing. In Mariana, Florida, the low this morning was 31 degrees. Even lower temperatures are expected for tomorrow in the southeast - where even New Orleans could drop to 31 degrees, setting a record low for this time of year, according to Accuweather.com. The winter weather has caused 17 deaths - mostly from car crashes because of slippery roads - since Saturday. More crashes are expected as commuters re-learn how to drive in the snow. Chilly: By Tuesday afternoon, much of the country was still under deep freeze. Even parts of the south remained below freezing . More of the same: Wednesday promises to severely cold all over again, with freezing temperatures dipping all the way into central Florida and south Texas . Warming slightly: Thursday will be slightly less cold as the weather warms ahead of the weekend. Lows in most places will still be unseasonably chilly . Colder than is should be: Nearly the entire country is experiencing below-average temperatures. In the South, Midwest and Northeast, it's 15 to 25 degrees colder than it normally is this time of year . Snow-vember: Nearly half of the country is covered in snow - from Washington to Texas, Tennessee to Maine there is at least a trace of snow on the ground right now . Whiteout: Snowy clouds can be seen swirling over the Great Lakes, center, and expanding into New York State and New England . Snowed in: One family is Buffalo will have a hard time getting outside thanks to the giant snow drift on their front lawn . Alternative transportation: A firefighter left his truck behind and got on a snowmobile in Depew, New York, on Tuesday . Even in Buffalo, a city that knows snow, the winter pounding took some residents by surprise. A Buffalo News photographer captured this young man wearing shorts while helping a driver dig out . Digging out: One Buffalo resident had to dig a trench just so she could open the door to let her dog out . Roll on: A semi tries its best to heave itself up a steep street in Kalamazoo, Michigan . Firefighters worked to free a car stuck in the snow in Depew, New York, which was also socked on Tuesday . In the major northeast cities, residents broke out their heavy winter coats early and bundled up against the bitterest temperatures so far this season. In New York City, the low hit 27 degrees, 18 with the wind chill. Washington, DC, hit 28, with a wind chill of 17 degrees. The low in Philadelphia was 27 with a wind chill of 13 this morning. And Boston was a comparatively toasty 38, with a wind chill of 30. The temperature is expected to drop even lower tonight - hitting 21 in New York and Philadelphia, 24 in Washington and 23 in Boston. Mr Kines, of Accuweather, said the cold temperatures are due to the jetstream settling in the far southern US, which is bringing cold air south from the arctic to blanket nearly the entire country. The country is in for more cold the rest of the week - and it will possibly get colder on Wednesday. However, by the weekend temperatures will warm - possibly all the way into the 60s by Monday in the northeastern US. The weather forecasts show milder temperatures and few storms on the horizon for the busy Thanksgiving holiday travel, Mr Kines said. Coming down: Western Michigan was also hard hit by lake effect snow. Grand Rapids, Michigan, where as much as 10 and a half inches fell on Tuesday . Surprise! Kapone the pooch is about to get a cold introduction to winter from owner Lauren Hansen, who shoveled off her porch in Grand Rapids Tuesday . Fun in the snow: Like any good western New York residents, Brooke Driscoll (left) and Buffalo Bills wide receiver Marquise Goodwin (right) enjoyed their snow day . Buried in Buffalo: Residents were urged to stay home and keep off the streets in the midst of the deluge . Sledders, from left, Kaitlin Crawford, Casey Brugh and Kyle LeBarron trek across the snow-covered Helfrich Hills Golf Course in Evansville, Indiana in search of the perfect hill on Monday morning . Cold-lanta: Even residents of normally-balmy Atlanta had to bundle up against the cold as temperatures dipped into the 20s . High winds mixed with the heavy snowfall to cause-near whiteout conditions in much of Buffalo . Three feet: This Buffalo resident measured 34 inches of snow on Tuesday morning - and two more feet could fall before it stops . Silver lining? The cold weather is great news for those in the ski industry - pictured are snow cannons getting to work on Roundtop Mountain in Lewisberry, Pennsylvania . Even cold down south: Two students in Jackson, Mississippi, bundled up on their way to school after temperatures hit 27 degrees. A low of 24 is expected tonight . Surf's not up: Even on the sands of Dania Beach, Florida, the chilly weather kept all but a hardy few out of the sea . Thunder and lightning are more usually associated with warmer climates but under certain conditions they can occur in cold ones too. Thundersnow starts out like a summer thunderstorm - the sun heats the ground and pushes masses of warm, moist air upward, creating unstable air columns. As it rises, the moisture condenses to form clouds, which are jostled by internal turbulence. Lightning is caused by this rubbing of the clouds against each other - thunder is the sound of lightning but as sound moves more slowly than light we hear it later. The tricky part for making thundersnow is creating that atmospheric instability in the wintertime. When it is cold, and particularly in air conducive to snowfall, the lower atmosphere is dry, cold and very stable. For thundersnow to occur there needs to be a very precise set of circumstances - the air layer closer to the ground has to be warmer than the layers above, but still cold enough to create snow. When this happens warm air rises, snow falls and thunder, lightning and snow all occur at the same time.","Every single state experienced below-freezing temperatures Tuesday .

"Google will pay $3.2 billion to buy Nest Labs, a company that develops high-tech versions of devices like thermostats and smoke detectors, in its second-largest acquisition ever. The search engine operator was an early investor in Nest Labs. It says the company's Nest Learning Thermostat has been a 'consistent best-seller'. The thermostat, which retails for $249, is designed to learn how inhabitants like their homes to be heated and cooled. Once it learns the consumers' preferences, it automatically adjusts the temperature on its own. Google will shell out $3.2 billion for Nest Labs, a company founded by gadget guru and former Apple technician Tony Fadell (pictured) that creates 'smart' home products like smoke alarms and thermostats . The Nest Learning Thermostat, which is the company's best seller and retails for $249, learns how the owners like to heat and cool their homes and makes adjustments on its own . Google's latest acquisition - its second largest after buying Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion - marks yet another expansion for the company beyond internet search advertising . Its Nest Protect alarm is intended to be less annoying than traditional alarms: when it detects rising smoke or carbon monoxide levels, it lights up yellow and speaks with human voice, giving consumers an option to turn the device off if there is no emergency. They can stop the alert by waving an arm. The Nest Protect costs $129 while an older smoke and carbon monoxide detector could cost $50 to $80. Analyst Shyam Patil of Wedbush Securities said Google is positioning itself to offer products that work on the 'Internet of Things' - specifically a 'connected home' full of intelligent wireless devices that collect data and could be controlled with a smartphone. The 'Internet of Things' is a global network that not only links computers, tablets and phones but connects everything from bikes to washing machines to thermostats. Last year Google introduced Chromecast, a device that lets users connect their TVs and mobile devices. The Nest smoke alarm, which costs $129, can be turned off by users by a wave of the arm . 'It's a big market opportunity and it provides Google with good technology to attack it over time,' Patil said in a telephone interview. He has a 'Neutral' rating on Google shares. The deal represents Google's biggest since it closed on the $12.5 billion purchase of Motorola in May 2012. Nest Labs is based in Palo Alto, California. It was founded in 2010 by Tony Fadell, a gadget guru who helped design the iPod and original iPhone while working at Apple. Google Inc. is based in Mountain View, California. Its shares fell $7.20 to $1,122.98 on Monday before the report and rose $6.02 to $1,129 in aftermarket trading.","Nest Labs was started  in 2010 by Tony Fadell, a gadget guru who helped design the iPod and original iPhone while working at Apple .

"Smart: The world's first smartphone toothbrush tells its users where they have gone wrong . Few things could be as easy as cleaning your teeth – or so you’d think. Apply toothpaste to brush, stick brush in mouth, give the old pearly whites a good scrub, then rinse. It seems, however, that many of us are not doing it properly, for example not spending long enough on the task or brushing too hard. Now help is at hand for the problem you never knew existed, in the unlikely shape of your smartphone. Dental hygiene company Oral-B has invented a toothbrush that sends information to your phone as you brush. Your phone then displays messages that tell you how you’re doing and suggesting improvements. The SmartSeries electric brush links to your iPhone or Android device via Bluetooth wireless technology, with an app allowing you to follow instructions on the screen. If you brush too hard, the phone receives signals from the brush and displays an alert to prevent you from damaging your gums. The phone also times your brush using a virtual stopwatch – experts say many of us do not brush for the recommended two minutes. At the end of the session, the smartphone displays a summary of how well you brushed your teeth – with tips on what you could do better next time.  The app can even be personalised with the help of a dentist, who may advise a user to pay more attention to certain areas of the mouth. Manufacturer Procter & Gamble launched the £199 brush this week and it is expected to go on sale in Britain in June. An Oral-B spokesman said: ‘Dentists always tell us, “People do a great job in the week before they come to visit us and in the week after they visit us. But nothing can hide the fact that when we look inside the mouth we can see all the areas they miss”. A brush with the future: Deutsche Telekom chief executive Timotheus Hottges unveiled the technology today at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. It has six modes including sensitive and tongue cleaning . You reached your goal! A graphic showing some of the features of the smart toothbrush . ‘It will guide you in terms of how to brush, and you will be able to fully personalise the brushing routine for you.’ The app, which will be available for . free on iPhone and Android phones, also tells the user how many seconds . to spend cleaning each part of the mouth, displaying a graphic with . different teeth highlighted during the clean. You can programme it to six modes which alter the motion of the brush – daily cleaning, deep clean, whitening, gum care, sensitive, or tongue cleaning. The app also stores your data so you can view your brushing habits in a graph by day, week or month, said to be useful for parents who want to monitor their children’s brushing. When it’s time to visit the dentist, the app will display an alert and a list of surgeries in the user’s area. Perhaps inevitably, there is even a way to share your brushing achievements on Facebook using the ‘trophy’ option. And because many people get bored while brushing, the app has a feature which allows the user to watch the news. In tests, the app extended average brushing times from less than a minute for a manual toothbrush to two minutes and 16 seconds, according to the manufacturer.","SmartSeries electric toothbrush links to a smartphone app via Bluetooth .

"The United States soccer team may have been given 'no chance' of winning the World Cup by coach Jurgen Klinsmann, but that doesn't mean they can't enjoy their luxurious Sao Paulo base - while they can. Arriving in a Sao Paolo crippled by strikes, riots and the worst outbreak of dengue fever in a generation on Monday, captain Clint Dempsey and his team mates checked into the 5-star Hotel Tivoli Sao Paulo Mofarrej under armed guard. With the Presidential suite at the modernist hotel inspired by the architecture of Brazil's legendary architect, Oscar Niemeyer, costing $1,460 a night, the United States Soccer Federation have spared no expense to make their players comfortable at the world's biggest party. Luxurious: The living room of a presidential suite at the Tivoli Sao Paulo Mofarrej, the hotel where the US 2014 World Cup team will stay during the World Cup which begins on June 12 . Good job that is too, because the the US players face an arduous task to make even the final 16, having been drawn in the so-called 'Group of Death' along with Germany, Portugal and perennial rivals Ghana. Far-flung games from the northeastern coast to the humid Amazon rainforest will force the US team to fly about 9,000 miles in three round-trip flights between the matches and their base in Sao Paulo. The US soccer team checked into the downtown hotel after arriving on a bus draped with the flag and slogan, 'United by team, driven by passion'. With 219 rooms, there is more than enough room to cope with the unprecedented demand for hotels across Brazil, as the soccer-mad nation prepares to host largest sporting event on Earth. Standard: A more modest but nonetheless impressive hotel room more like where the US Soccer players will be based during the World Cup . Sophisticated: Even the bathrooms at the Sao Paulo hotel exude a level of class that befits the United States' 7th consecutive appearance at the World Cup . Welcome: The main lobby at the Tivoli São Paulo Mofarrej has been heavily renovated to match the hotel's claim to be one of the most chic in modernist Sao Paulo . Central location: The main lobby has a glass canopy that opens up the hotel to downtown Sao Paulo . While the chaotic metropolis of Sao Paulo's 12 million residents rages outside, the players will be able to relax at the hotel's famous Elements Spa - that has both Brazilian and Thai massage therapists, skilled in promoting physical and spiritual well-being. All guests are greeted with a fruit bowl and receive a nightly turndown service complete with a square of honey cake and the next day’s weather report - which will not be needed to predict the staggering heat of the north, where the US plays all three group games. The pool at the hotel appears to be filled with orange Fanta, but is actually an optical illusion created by the use of tangerine-hued glass tiles according to Luxury Latin America. Food at the hotel is provided by two-star Michelin chef, Sergi Arola. Who since November 2009 has presided over  the Arola-Vintretes restaurant, which serves creative Mediterranean-influenced cuisine along with an extensive menu of tapas. The dining room, which also has a posh bar, occupies the 23rd floor. This is the beautiful 4th-floor Elements Spa operated by the renowned Thai company Banyan Tree. The spa has trained Thai and Brazilian staff . Refined: The master suite at the luxury hotel - The 5-star base is where the United States hopes the past two years of planning finally comes together on their World Cup assault . Modernist: The Tivoli Mofarrej's external structure that soars impressively above the chic neighborhood of Jardins and bustling Avenida Paulista - but the interior has been radically altered .

Armed guard: The US Men's National Soccer Team departs on shuttles to their terminal with Federal Police escorts after arriving at Sao Paulo International Airport on June 9 . Having practiced at Sao Paulo FC's Frederico Antonio Germano Menzen training center, the players will fly the 1,444 miles to Natal to take on 2010 nemesis Ghana on June 16. While the temperatures in Sao Paulo in June are around 72 degrees with an average humidity of 78, the climate in Natal and Recife are very different. Situated on the Atlantic coast, both relatively modern cities hit highs of 85 degrees in June and the average humidity is 80 percent. That is nothing compared to Manaus, described as a 'bustling frontier outpost of the modern, industrial world on a distant, jungle planet, 1,671 miles from Sao Paulo'. Manaus is surrounded on three sides by mostly impassible jungle and on the other by rivers: the enormous Rio Negro and the almost unimaginably more powerful Amazon River. Realistic: US head coach Jurgen Klinsmann talks with his assistant coaches in training in Florida, before his team jetted to Brazil on Monday . Massive, 9,000 mile trek: The United State soccer team will travel thousands of miles from Sao Paulo to their three group games . When you step off the plane, even the air can seem other-worldly, a hot, humid blast that feels like steam - so much so that physical effort can be utterly exhausting. A local delicacy is the toxic soup, tacacá. It is made from the wild cassava root common to the Amazon. To eat the wild cassava, you have to squeeze out the juice and boil it, which removes its toxic qualities. The result is a yellowish cooking broth packed with nutrients that Amazon tribes call tucupi. Tacacá is hot tucupi with dried shrimp and jambú, a spinach-like green that briefly numbs the tongue. Just to complete their group, the US soccer team will have flown 9,000 or so miles over ten days to and from Sao Paulo taking on Ghana, Portugal and the best player in the world, Cristiano Ronaldo and then finally, the might of Germany. Final preparations: View of the football field at the Sao Paulo FC training centre in Sao Paulo which will host US national football team during the FIFA World Cup Brazil 2014 . Training: View of a gym at the Sao Paulo FC training centre in Sao Paulo which will host US national football team during the FIFA World Cup Brazil 2014 .

View of the Sao Paulo FC training centre in Sao Paulo which will host US national football team during the FIFA World Cup . Choosing to be based in Sao Paolo to take advantage of the modern facilities may seem foolish, especially in light of the continuing problems between Brazilian police and striking subway workers. They clashed on Monday on a station not far from the US hotel and are threatening to maintain the work stoppage through the World Cup opening match here this week. Authorities are deeply worried about the strike because the subway is the main means of transportation for World Cup fans who will attend Thursday's opening match when Brazil takes on Croatia. Riot police firing tear gas forced about 100 striking workers out of the station as the strike threw Sao Paulo's normally congested traffic into chaos for a fifth day. About half of the city's subway stations were operating, but with greatly diminished service. Coastal: This is where the World Cup will kick-off for the United States against Ghana on June 16 . Jungle: An aerial view is seen of the Arena Amazonia soccer stadium in Manaus where the United States will play Portugal on June 22 . Final match: An aerial view of the Arena Pernambuco soccer stadium is seen in Recife, northeastern Brazil - where the United States will finish off the group matches against Germany on June 26 . 'This is the way they negotiate, with tear gas and repression,' said Alexandre Roland, a union leader, as he and others regrouped outside the station after confronting riot police. Altino Prazeres, president of the union leading the strike, said as he marched along with workers on a street in central Sao Paulo that 'we are not interested in ruining the World Cup.' 'I love soccer! I support our national team. The point is not to stop the Cup,' he said. 'We want to resolve this today and all are willing to negotiate.' Ultimately, the days are long gone when it was a surprise for the United States to reach the World Cup finals, but for a country used to sporting success they are still some way short of making a major impact on the tournament. It remains one of the final sporting frontiers for the United States to conquer although they reached the semi-finals in 1930 and caused one of soccer's greatest upsets when they beat England the last time that the World Cup was held in Brazil in 1950. Poverty: This photograph shows the Portuguese phrase 'Amor ao Barrio' (Love to the neighborhood) written in large white letters on a green wall in the Brasilandia neighborhood of Sao Paulo - a notorious favela - or Brazilian slum . Since that inaugural event they have reached the quarter-finals just once, in 2002, although this will be the United States' seventh successive appearance in the finals, a consistent run bettered only by Brazil, Italy, Argentina, Germany, Spain and South Korea. The U.S. have a solid team with a lot of depth in the midfield and an experienced coach who knows what it takes to win the sport's ultimate prize. They have also recorded confidence-boosting victories against European opposition since Klinsmann took over in 2011, including Germany, Italy and world champions Spain. 'I look at things always from a positive side. We have a young team, a team that is growing. We've built a lot over the past two years,' Klinsmann said. 'We've had the most successful year in our history in 2013, so we've built the confidence and the belief that we can deal with those challenges. We're going to take it one game at a time, starting with Ghana who gave us some issues in the recent World Cups.

"Students in Wisconsin have taken to social media to blast Michelle Obama for their Thanksgiving themed lunches that feature a brown mystery mush. The brown paste was served at Richland Center High School in Wisconsin and students earlier this month and they didn't find the meal to be especially appetizing. A student named Hunter Whitney posted photos of the brown mush and a single red apple along with the caption, 'Had a very #healthylunch today. The apple definitely made up for the 'mystery mush' #ThanksMichelleObama.' Healthy eating?: Students at a Wisconsin high school posted pics along with criticism of their supposedly healthier Thanksgiving themed school lunches . Sarcasm: Students sarcastically thanked Michelle Obama as they posted photos of their school lunches . Thanksgiving?: Students are less than thankful for their school's interpretation of healthy school lunches . Another student named Marissa Garret tweeted, 'So disappointed in this modified Thanksgiving lunch.. @MichelleObama #ThanksMichelleObama' Along with her caption came a photo displaying canned green beans along with several other brown clumps of mystery food. Students speculated on of the brown clumps might be a sort of rice substitute--a poor one. A student named Maya Wuertz posted her recent Thanksgiving inspired lunch at Austin High School in Minnesota, reports Eagnews.org. The lunch features soggy string beans and other sorts of clumped together  mystery items. The Thanksgiving lunches weren't the only ones that were criticized. Even popular chicken finger Friday was reduced to a plate with three measly chicken strips. A student named Malachai Dobbins quipped, 'It's chicken finger Friday! Oh wait no it's not!' The new lunches comply with food regulations championed by First Lady Michelle Obama and implemented by the USDA. USDA regulations now require foods in the school lunch line to be healthier. Chicken Finger what?: This student misses celebrating the coveted chicken finger Friday at his school . Disappointed: Student Melissa Garrett was left with a grumbling belly and a hot temper at lunchtime . Still hungry: Students posted photos of the small amount of food they receive at school lunches . Calorie, fat, sugar and sodium limits have to be met on almost every food and beverage sold during the school day at 100,000 schools. Concessions sold at afterschool sports games are exempt. Mrs Obama made herself a national emblem of healthier eating in 2010 with a legislative push for more fruit, vegetables and whole grains in school meals, along with less sodium, sugar and fat. School nutritionists and food service workers, and their unions, hailed the law's passage but have since turned on Mrs Obama, saying her caloric inflexibility has sparked a dramatic downturn in lunch sales. Many school districts, they say, are now losing money on food instead of turning a profit that pays for books, computers and football-field scoreboards. Mrs Obama said in July that she would 'fight until the bitter end to make sure that every kid in this country continues to have the best nutrition that they can have.'

"Americans radicalized by . online propaganda from Islamic State and other militant groups . pose the main terrorist threat to the United States, which is . especially vulnerable to foreign fighters returning from Syria, . senior U.S. security officials said on Wednesday. While there is no evidence that the radical Islamist group . plans an attack on U.S. soil, its vigorous propaganda machine . and sophisticated online recruitment efforts created a clear . potential threat, they said. A law enforcement bulletin obtained by FoxNews.com warned that Islamic State fighters have increased calls for 'lone wolves' to attack U.S. soldiers in America in recent months, citing one tweet that called for jihadists to find service members' addresses online and then 'show up and slaughter them.' The heads of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Homeland . Security and the National Counterterrorism Center issued the . warning in a hearing before the House Homeland Security . Committee. Scroll down for video . Ominous: A new ISIS video, which has since been taken down by YouTube, includes a brief and shaky clip of the White House as a car drives past - clearly threatening the home of the U.S. president . Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson:  The U.S. is able to track Westerners who travel to and from Syria, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson says. But inside Syria, there are intelligence gaps . Federal Bureau of Investigation Director James Comey (left), and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson (right), talk before the start of a House Homeland Security Full Committee hearing . They spoke as the U.S. military prepared to expand U.S.-led . military action against Islamic State from Iraq to Syria, . and before a House of Representatives vote on . President Barack Obama's request to arm Syrian rebels to fight . the militants. Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said Islamic State . was committed to attacking Americans just because they were . Americans, as shown in videos it released in recent weeks of the . beheadings of journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff. The group's threat lies in its online attempts to radicalize . Americans and its efforts to recruit from 2,000 Westerners who . have traveled to Syria to fight President Bashar al-Assad's . government, the officials said. The foreign fighters, who included 100 Americans, 'may . eventually return to their home countries battle-hardened, . radicalized and determined to attack us,' said Matt Olsen, the . leading U.S. counterterrorism official. There will be 'a continued call - by Western fighters in Syria and terrorist organizations - for lone offender attacks against U.S. military facilities and personnel,' warned a July law enforcement intelligence bulletin from the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange, a state-run agency that gathers, assesses and shares threat information and works with the Department of Homeland Security. 'These threats will most likely increase should the U.S. or its allies attack the Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (ISIS) in Syria or Iraq.' Making a plan: US President Barack Obama addresses the media following briefings with US Central Command officials on the Islamic State (IS) militant group during a visit to MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, USA, . 'U.S.-based [Home-Grown Violent Extremists] could be inspired by this rhetoric to turn their attention towards carrying out attacks at home,' the bulletin states. The radical rhetoric is delivered via social media, where Islamic State operatives have long exhorted westerners to get on a plane and come join the battle. But terrorists now believe they can have a powerful effect from afar just by inspiring attacks inside the U.S. 'In recent Twitter posts, foreign fighters in Syria have encouraged Muslims in the West to target soldiers with spontaneous attacks using small arms (i.e. knives and guns),' the bulletin said. New York City police officers stand guard in Times Square on Wednesday after a blog affiliated with the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) mentioned the iconic city center as a target for bombing . He said Syria remained a key training ground for independent . or al Qaeda-aligned groups, and that the rate of travelers going . to Syria exceeded that of those who went to Afghanistan, .

Syria foreign fighters who may carry U.S. or European passports. The officials cited the arrest of a Rochester, New York, man . announced on Tuesday, on charges of trying to provide material . support to Islamic State and attempting to murder U.S. soldiers. FBI Director James Comey acknowledged the difficulties of . countering the homegrown threat. 'In a country this big and this . free, with the material that is available, it's a big . challenge,' he said. The administration officials outlined threats from militant . groups around the world, including al Qaeda offshoots, and said . they continued to focus on airline security to counter a primary . threat.

'This boundless virtual environment, combined with . terrorists' increasingly sophisticated use of social media, . makes it increasingly difficult to protect our youth from . propaganda,' Olsen said.

Barcelona have been decisive in the past with top players and sent Zlatan Ibrahimovic on loan to AC Milan when he failed to settle into Pep Guardiola’s side after his £50m move from Inter. Although Barcelona have no intention of selling Suarez yet, he could be the fall guy in the summer under a new regime at the Nou Camp. Club president, Josep Maria Bartomeu revealed that he was calling the presidential elections early as the team prepare for this evening’s Copa del Rey clash with Elche in the Nou Camp. Suarez’s position is further complicated by the Court of Arbitration for Sport’s decision to uphold FIFA’s one-year transfer ban for illegal approaches to under-age players, which means they cannot replace him yet.

"President Barack Obama appears to shrug-off his well-publicized spat with Hillary Clinton - joining the former Secretary of State on the dance floor to boogie the night away at a friend's birthday party. The President was photographed getting his groove on at the Martha's Vineyard party on Wednesday night following a dinner where he sat next to Mrs Clinton days after she criticized his foreign policy. In an interview last weekend, Clinton described U.S. policy in Syria as a failure and said Obama's doctrine of ""'don't do stupid stuff"" is not an organising principle' for a great nation. Scroll down for video . Good times: Hillary Clinton joins President Obama on the dance floor during the Birthday party of Vernon Jordan's wife at Martha's Vineyard .

Secretary Clinton and former President Clinton.' Approximately 150 . people were at the celebration where both Obama and Clinton delivered 80th birthday toasts to guest of honor . Ann Jordan, wife of Democratic adviser Vernon Jordan. Mr Jordan, a civil rights leader and staunch Obama supporter, is a close friend of Bill Clinton who he served as a senior adviser. In 2006, Jordan served as a member of the Iraq Study Group, making recommendations on the U.S. policy in Iraq.A photo of the president dancing was posted to Instagram by a fellow party goer, however it has now been deleted.

Water under the bridge: 'We have disagreements as any partners and friends, as we are, might very well have,' Clinton told reporters crowded into a bookstore signing of her memoir Hard Choices yesterday .

Yesterday, he opted not to leave . his vacation home except to attend Mrs. Jordan's birthday party at Farm . Neck Golf Club, where he was expected to rendezvous with Clinton. The former rivals' meet-up at last . night's party was hotly anticipated in the wake of Clinton's criticisms of Obama's approach to . foreign policy in an interview with the Atlantic that was released over . the weekend. 'Great . nations need organizing principles, and ""don't do stupid stuff"" is not . an organizing principle,' she said, referring to a version of the phrase . Obama and his advisers have used privately to describe his approach to . foreign policy.

Obama in a recent interview, but Schultz insisted yesterday that Clinton and Obama 'have had many hugs over the years' and the forthcoming one would be no different. A former top Obama adviser, David . Axelrod, took to Twitter to jab Clinton back: 'Just to clarify: ""Don't . do stupid stuff"" means stuff like occupying Iraq in the first place, . which was a tragically bad decision.' Clinton voted in favor of the Iraq War in 2002, while Obama voiced opposition. The . very public foreign policy disagreement was Clinton's biggest split . with Obama since their 2008 presidential primary campaign when she . questioned whether her younger Senate colleague was qualified to take a 3 . a.m. phone call on an emergency. Clinton . took a more hawkish stance than Obama in that campaign, particularly on . the Iraq War, but Obama put their bitter contest behind them by naming . her his top diplomat. Hillary Clinton and Obama attended the same birthday party last night in Martha's Vineyard but reporters were not allowed in. The last time Obama was seen publicly outside of the party was on Tuesday, when he was spotted playing golf in the afternoon and dining with his wife and several members of his administration at a local restuarant . Clinton . loyally carried out Obama's foreign policy agenda for four years but . described some objections she raised internally in Hard Choices, which . focuses on her time in the administration. She . expanded on those objections in her Atlantic interview, saying Obama's . 'failure' to fully support the rebels in Syria fueled the rise of . Islamic State militants now the object of U.S. airstrikes in Iraq. Reporters . who crowded in front of a table set up for Clinton's signing at the . Bunch of Grapes bookstore yesterday asked her whether she disagreed with . Obama's Iraq policy.

"Hospital managers are taking legal action to evict elderly patients who are ‘bed-blocking’. They say families are refusing to take responsibility for elderly relatives and abandoning them in hospital wards, even when they are fit to leave. Families are being told they have seven days to find their relative a space in a care home – or risk being taken to court. Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital trust, where the policy is being imposed, says some families have even asked it to ‘keep hold’ of patients while they take a holiday. Scroll down for video . Abandoned: Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospital trust, where the policy is being imposed, says some families have even asked it to ‘keep hold’ of patients. Above, Royal Bournemouth Hospital . The trust said the policy was a ‘last resort’, but it was necessary because of the huge pressures caused by bed-blocking. The extraordinary policy was revealed amid growing concerns over the pressures on hospitals – with Accident and Emergency departments across the country said to be in ‘meltdown’. This is partly a result of bed-blocking, because it prevents patients being moved from A&E to other wards. Figures earlier this week showed that bed-blocking had reached record levels, with doctors unable to discharge 1,000 patients every day. The crisis has deepened because of a lack of council-provided care for the elderly. And over the past two weeks, overwhelmed casualty departments have begun pleading with the public to stay away unless they are seriously ill. Managers at Bournemouth and Christchurch Hospitals said the eviction policy was in place across Dorset and that they hoped other trusts – including Poole and Dorset County– would follow suit. Trust spokesman Katie Whiteside told BBC Radio Solent: ‘We have relatives coming back telling us they don’t like the decor of care homes, or they don’t like the member of staff who met them at the door. Hospitals could use anti-trespassing laws to evict patients from their beds. The same laws are generally used to ban gangs of teenagers from shopping centres. Under current law, bed-blocking is seen as a civil offence, not a criminal act. If a patient refused to leave after being given 48 hours’ written notice, the hospital could seek a court order for possession of the bed. The owner of an NHS trust would then be able to sue for damages if an individual refused to leave after a series of warnings. In 2006, Barnet primary care trust in North London used a High Court possession order to remove a patient who had been in hospital for three years after being declared fit to go home. The patient was also made to pay £10,000 in legal fees. Under trespass law, owners can regulate the terms on which visitors occupy their premise. This principle was used to ban hoodies in shopping centres. ‘Sometimes they are decorating the house or having a “granny annexe” built and they know that, while the patients are here, they are being fed, watered and looked after.’ She added that one family asked the hospital to ‘keep hold’ of a relative while they took a two-week holiday in Turkey. ‘We would be in a position to commence formal proceedings to actually evict them from their beds if that was necessary. It would be an absolute last resort. ‘If we had to go through the courts we would seek to recover costs (from relatives) of up to £50,000, so it’s serious stuff.’ It is understood the trust would use anti-trespassing laws to evict patients, although managers would not confirm this. Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘Hospital beds are very valuable, they are not there for elderly relatives to be parked in until it is convenient. Hospitals have got to do this, they are very overcrowded.’ Dr Paul Flynn, chairman of the British Medical Association’s consultant committee, said: ‘Pressure on NHS services is at a critical point and cracks are beginning to appear. While the NHS is used to seeing a spike in demand during winter months, this year emergency departments have experienced a spring, summer and autumn crisis as well, leaving no spare capacity in hospitals as we approach winter. NHS figures published yesterday showed that the average hospital bed occupancy rate is 87.6 per cent – well above the 85 per cent safe level. It is above 95 per cent at 13 trusts, including George Eliot, Warwickshire (98.3 per cent) and Mid Essex (97.7 per cent). Families are being told they have seven days to find their relative a space in a care home – or risk being taken to court. The  policy was revealed amid growing concerns over the pressures on hospitals. (File image) Ideally, hospitals should have at least 15 per cent of beds free to allow for a sudden surge of patients admitted from casualty. In 2011, two other trusts, Aintree University Foundation Trust and Southport and Ormskirk Hospital Trust, both on Merseyside, threatened to use similar powers to Bournemouth to alleviate bed-blocking. Managers say the policy has been used only on very rare occasions when there has been a dispute with the family. Shadow health secretary Andy Burnham said: ‘The fact that hospitals were full to bursting over the summer will worry people about what lies ahead this winter. ‘Social care in England is close to collapse and patients can’t be discharged home. In turn, soaring numbers are waiting on trolleys in the A&E department downstairs for a bed to become free.’ A Bournemouth and Christchurch trust spokesman said: ‘The idea of the Pan Dorset Managing Choice Policy is to ensure all patients who require care are in the most appropriate environment. Once medically fit for discharge, an acute hospital environment is not in the patient’s best interest. ‘In terms of the “seven-day action”, we are asking that when patients and their representatives are given names of care homes from the hospital staff, for example, they view these homes and come to a decision within seven calendar days.’ NHS England would not comment on the issue.","Hospital chiefs say families refuse to take responsibility for relatives .

"A Syrian rebel filmed cutting out and eating the lung of a dead government soldier has said he has no regrets.

'Our slogan is an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth,' he told TIME magazine.

Remorseless: After removing what appears to be the dead man's heart, Al Hamad then reaches into the chest cavity . Using a knife, the man hacks open the torso and removes two organs before holding them up to the camera and declaring: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog.' He then raises one to his mouth and takes a bite. Al Hamad who is Sunni and has a sectarian hatred for Alawite Muslims insists the video captures the first time he had ever attempted to eat an enemy’s liver. Gory: Brandishing the organs for the camera to see, Al Hamad  continues his rant against Assad's government . 'We opened his cell phone and I found . a clip of a woman and her two daughters fully naked and he was . humiliating them, and sticking a stick here and there,' Al Hamad told TIME magazine via Skype phone call yesterday. He said he has another gruesome video of him killing a government soldier from the Alawite faith and sawing him into pieces. The Supreme Military Council has . issued a poster - circulated on Facebook - calling for al Hamad’s arrest, . saying it wants him 'dead or alive.' The video, posted on YouTube by and billed as proof of a war crime, is the latest . installment of a propaganda war that is growing fast behind the scenes . of this bloody conflict. Last month, a photograph was released . by a pro-Assad group based in Lebanon that appeared to show a young . rebel fighter barbecuing the severed head of a government soldier. Experts say such images demonstrate . that the battlefield has spread from rubble-strewn streets and . war-churned fields to the internet as both sides vie to control their . public image and discredit that of their opposition. Meanwhile, human rights groups say it . is emblematic of a civil war that has rapidly descended into sectarian . hatred and revenge killings. In the most recent video, Al Hamad . tells the camera: 'I swear to God we will eat your hearts and your . livers, you soldiers of Bashar the dog,' His rant is greeted by offscreen cheers of his comrades shouting 'Allahu akbar (God is great)'.

Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch . said that he had seen an original, unedited copy of the video and that . Al Hamad's identity had been confirmed by rebel sources in Homs and by . images of him in other videos wearing the same black jacket as in the . latest clip and with the same rings on his fingers. 'The . mutilation of the bodies of enemies is a war crime. But the even more . serious issue is the very rapid descent into sectarian rhetoric and . violence,' said Bouckaert. He said that in the unedited version . of the film, Al Hamad instructs his men to 'slaughter the Alawites and . take their hearts out to eat them', before biting into the heart. Al Hamad  has been seen in previous videos firing rockets at Lebanese . Shi'ite villages on the border and posing with the body of a soldier . purportedly from the Lebanese Shi'ite militant Hezbollah group, which is . helping Assad's forces. The Syrian conflict started with . peaceful protests in March 2011, but when these were suppressed it . gradually turned into an increasingly sectarian civil war which, . according to one opposition monitoring group, has cost more than 80,000 . lives.

"Vile crimes: The $139million settlement puts a legal end to the saga that began when Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt, 63, was arrested in 2012 and accused of blindfolding students and spoon-feeding them his semen . The Los Angeles Unified School District has agreed to pay unprecedented $139million to end all remaining litigation involving an elementary school teacher who served students cookies laced with his bodily fluids in a sickening tasting game. The deal involving 81 students puts a legal end to the saga that began when Miramonte Elementary School teacher Mark Berndt, 63, was arrested in 2012 and accused of blindfolding students and spoon-feeding them his semen spread over baked goods. Plaintiff's lawyers had planned to present evidence suggesting the school district was aware of sexual misconduct by Berndt three decades ago but failed to act until a photo processor at a pharmacy contacted police about film Berndt dropped off that showed pictures of blindfolded children being fed some substance. The 19-year-old woman had only been on the job a month. 'She was told not to call the police by her supervisors and she did it, anyway,' John Manley, one of the attorneys who filed the lawsuit, said at a news conference. 'If she hadn't made that call, we wouldn't be here today and he'd still be teaching.' Some of the images that raised a red flag for the pharmacy staffer depicted a spoon filled with a milky liquid, seen in around the mouths of children. A detective would later find a plastic spoon matching the one in the pictures in Berndt's classroom trash bin. The utensil tested positive for semen that matched the teacher's DNA. Investigators later found he took bondage-style photographs of his young students, some with semen-laced cookies held to their blindfolded faces or cockroaches crawling on them. The case led to an overhaul of how the nation's second-largest school district handles allegations of sexual abuse. After Berndt's arrest, the district removed all 130 staff members from the school and placed them at an unopened empty campus during the lengthy investigation. Creepy: A photo processor at a pharmacy contacted police about film Berndt, pictured left and right dressed in Mickey Mouse ears, dropped off that showed pictures of blindfolded children being fed some substance . More red flags: Two Miramonte teachers reported back in the 1980s that Berndt was exposing himself to students, but the teacher was allowed to continue working with kids . Justice served: Mark Berndt was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading no contest to 23 counts of lewd conduct . 'Our goal from the outset of these appalling revelations has been to spare the Miramonte community the anguish of a protracted trial, while at the same time being mindful of the financial consequences stemming from settlements,' school district Superintendent Ramon C. Cortines said in a statement. 'Given these circumstances, we believe we struck a balance between those objectives.' Berndt was sentenced to 25 years in prison after pleading no contest to 23 counts of lewd conduct. The settlement reached during jury selection is in addition to $30million the district previously agreed to pay to settle 65 other cases involving Berndt. Lawyers in the current case said it's believed to be the largest sex-abuse case settlement involving a school district. 'They were afraid of a blow-the-roof-off verdict to reach this kind of settlement,' said Mary Jo McGrath, a lawyer not involved in the case who trains school administrators around the country. 'The hope of this is that it hurts really bad for the school district and wakes people up.' Plaintiffs' lawyers said they uncovered evidence that LAUSD had destroyed potentially thousands of child abuse reports and logs that had been maintained for decades. Manley said that in the 1980s, two Miramonte teachers reported that Berndt was exposing himself to students. In one instance, he allegedly dropped his pants while on a field trip to a museum. Under suspicion: Several fourth-grade girls had complained in the early 1990s that Berndt was masturbating in class, but the allegations were dismissed . Cleaning house: After Berndt's arrest, the Los Angeles Unified School District removed all 130 staff members from Miramonte Elementary School . According to the Los Angeles Times, Berndt allegedly wrote a note to the school principal following the incident which read: 'Thanks again for the support you gave me. I did learn at least one thing for sure! Not to take students to the museum while wearing baggy shorts!' Several fourth-grade girls had complained in the early 1990s that Berndt was masturbating in class, but the allegations were dismissed and the girls were accused of lying. Around that period, a teacher observing Berndt's class reported to a principal that he was wearing loose-fitting shorts that exposed his genitals. The principal later denied receiving such a report and called the teacher a liar. The Sheriff's Department investigated Berndt in 1994 but no charges were filed for lack of evidence. A judge will determine how to distribute the settlement money among the families of the roughly 80 children involved in the latest agreement, based on such factors as how badly they were emotionally scarred and what kind of therapy they will need, attorneys for the district said.","Settlement, believed to be the largest of its kind, involves 81 children victimized by former teacher Mark Berndt .

"Victoria's Secret has released behind-the-scenes footage of its rigorous fashion show casting process, two weeks after it announced the models for this year's upcoming spectacle. A succession of lithe hopefuls are seen strutting their stuff clad in skimpy black underwear and sky-high heels, having trained for months ahead of their '30-second' chance to impress the New York-based casting directors. 'Every year it gets more competitive,' says Victoria's Secret's chief marketing officer Ed Razek. 'They're all working out, so many of them are boxing, so many of them are doing Pilates.' Scroll down for video . Pick me: Victoria's Secret has released behind-the-scenes footage of its rigorous casting process (pictured) ahead of its December 2, fashion show, which will take place in London . Speaking about what it takes for a fashion model to become a Victoria's Secret runway girl, the show's executive producer Monica Mitro says: 'We're looking for well-proportioned, beautiful skin, great personality, which is quite unique and rare.' Sophia Neophitou, the show's head stylist, looks for someone 'captivating' and 'memorable,' while casting director John Pfeiffer is seeking to be 'inspired.' It's hard to put a finger on what exactly makes some of the gazelle-like auditionees rise above the rest, but a vivacious energy seems to be paramount. Model Blanca Padilla, who ended up being selected to walk the show, certainly has the recipe down, remarking: 'Victoria's Secret is all about the power of a woman, about attitude, about feeling confident, about feeling sexy, about feeling beautiful.' And she certainly wasn't the only one exuding confidence and beauty at the casting call. 'It's going to be hard to do the edit because I've never put so many A's on a page before,' Mr Razek says.

Among their few criticisms, the judges turned girls down who were 'too serious,' 'too petite' and 'too fast.' Model Bridget Malcolm explained: 'It's such a hard process to get in. It's not only the casting. 'You're working out for months before, training hard and eating right. It's a combination of a LOT of work.' Agent Heather Hughes of Women Management preps her models for the casting call every year, and says: 'To walk in the Victoria's Secret Show is the most competitive. You cannot compare it to anything else.' High-standard: Mr Razek noted, 'It's going to be hard to do the edit because I've never put so many A's on a page before' Dig my jig?

Big deal: The Victoria's Secret Fashion Show castings are world-renowned as the most competitive in the whole fashion industry . One model who stood out, and not just for her beauty credentials, was Grace Mahary, who was praised for being fully 'invested' in the job and for turning up for the casting two minutes early. Ms Mahary also made it through and will walk the show next month, along with blonde stunner Romee Strijd and Brazilian beauty Daniela Braga, who all feature in the casting footage.

"An Indianapolis woman is outraged after her husband, who was sentenced Friday for drugging then raping her as she slept in her own bed, received no jail time. Even more infuriating for Mandy Boardman were the words of Marion Superior Judge Kurt Eisgruber as he handed down a suspended prison sentence and eight years home detention. 'The judge looked at me before he gave the final decision,' Boardman told the IndyStar. 'I was told that I needed to forgive my attacker and move on.' Scroll down for video . Injustice: Mandy Boardman's rapist husband received no jail time when a judge sentenced him Friday before telling her she needed to forgive him and move on . The dumbfounded mother of two said she doesn’t believe she received justice and that the judgment made her feel like she was ‘sucker punched in the gut’ to know that her ex-husband David Wise, 52, won’t see the inside of a prison. A jury convicted Wise last month of one count of rape and five counts of criminal deviate conduct — all felonies punishable by six to 20 years in prison. Boardman testified that in 2008 she found three sex videos of her on Wise’s cellphone but didn’t remember the sex or consenting to the videos. She said she once woke up with a pill dissolving in her mouth. Depraved: David Wise drugged and raped his wife in her own bed and was found out when she found videos of the attacks on his cell phone . Boardman, who was married to Wise for 12 years until their 2009 divorce, said she made a DVD copy of the videos and went to police with them in 2011. Boardman decided to speak out publicly about the case, presumably because of its outcome. ‘I received zero justice on Friday,’ she said. Wise’s defense attorney, Elizabeth Milliken, told The Indianapolis Star that Wise intends to appeal his conviction but declined additional comment. Judge Kurt Eisgruber declined to comment on the sentencing decision because of the planned appeal. Wise has no previous felony convictions, according to the Marion County prosecutor’s office. He has been convicted of battery, public indecency and driving while intoxicated, all of which are misdemeanors. Wise no longer has visitation rights for the couple’s son and daughter and spent 24 days in jail following his arrest. Marion County Deputy Prosecutor Courtney Curtis said prosecutors sought a sentence against Wise that included prison time. ‘There is no difference when a woman knows her attacker and when she doesn’t,’ Curtis said. ‘I think it is important to remember that this crime is one that was committed in the home and so serving a home sentence in the home is not something this office would ever ask for.’ Boardman said she plans to work with organizations and advocates to help other rape victims. ‘I want to be that person who’ll be strong for other women,’ she said. ‘They cannot be scared that because of the extremely light sentence that was handed down in this case, that it would happen to them as well.’ While Wise is banned from seeing his ex-wife, the former couple has two children. Wise is fighting for shared custody. Complications: Now as Wise appeals his conviction and Boardman tries to get him prison time for his crimes, stuck in the middle are the ex-couple's two children. Wise is seeking shared custody .","Mandy Boardman says she received no justice when an Indianapolis judge sentenced her husband David Wise, 52, on Friday .

"Two men in Louisiana got into a heated argument with a police officer last week after berating him for littering on public property. A cell phone video of the confrontation between Marcus Smith, his friend Randall Garrett and Chester Officer Lee Williams was posted on YouTube last Thursday, drawing more than 150,000 views. The 8-minute video, recorded by Garrett in the passenger’s seat in the parking lot of a grocery store in Ferriday, Louisiana, begins with the driver flagging down Officer Smith as he is walking from his patrol car. Scroll down for video . Heated exchange: Marcus Smith, his friend Randall Garrett and Chester Officer Lee Williams (pictured) got into a heated argument over littering outside a grocery store in Ferriday, Louisiana, last Thursday . 'I saw your passenger roll down the window and throw out a piece of candy wrapper on the road back there, and I just wanted to let you know that's not right,' Marcus Smith tells Williams. 'Let me tell you what you do. You worry about you,' the officer dressed in a police jacket says in reply. Smith then points out to Williams that littering is against the law, and that as a police officer it is his duty to uphold the law. Williams appears unfazed by the pointed remark, telling the motorist: 'Well, go do something about it.' He goes on: ‘I tell you what you do, you pull this vehicle off and get out of my face,’ Williams says. ‘Go write me a ticket.’ When Smith and his companion inform the cop that they had reported him to dispatch, Williams replies that it does not matter. Not happy: Officer Williams was evidently upset when Smith (left) flagged him down and berated him for throwing a candy wrapper out the window of his patrol car . Not impressed: The officer was unfazed when Smith told him that as a cop, it is his duty to uphold the law . The trio continue bickering for several more minutes, with the officer growing increasingly angry at the two men for stopping him in his tracks over a candy wrapper chucked out the window of his patrol car on Highway 245. At one point, Williams tries to turn the tables on the pair, saying that he was nice enough not to stop him on the highway, even though they were doing 65mph in a 45mph zone, but Garrett quickly points out that the cop was driving at the same rate of speed. ‘What you missed is you need to grow up, learn the law, then maybe you can say something,’ says Williams . Towards the end of the video, Garrett inquires of Williams how long he has been on the force. 'It ain't your f***ing business,' he rudely replies. War of words: After bickering for several minutes, Williams told Smith: 'You go file your complaint, boy' The verbal spat ends with William challenging Smith: 'You go file your complaint, boy.' Since the cell phone recording was posted online, other allegations have emerged against Officer Williams. An investigation into the cop’s employment history by a local news station has revealed that he had been fired from the Lake Providence Police Department for disciplinary reasons.

"A man has pleaded guilty to the horrific killing of his young grandson. Raymond Matthew Brittle, of Thurmont, Maryland, abused the two-year-old over an extended period of time, but ultimately killed the toddler one night when he refused to eat his dinner, beating him with a belt, kicking his body and even lifting the child up by his head. The boy died three days later at Children's National Medical Center in Washington D.C. on September 8, 2013. Guilty: Raymond Matthew brittle (above) has pleaded guilty to murder and child abuse after beating his grandson with a belt and kicking the toddler when he would not finish his dinner . Raymond, 40, has been indicted on seven charges, including second-degree murder, first-degree child abuse resulting in death, second-degree child abuse, conspiracy and assault. He pleaded guilty to all charges and faces up to 55 years in prison. His wife Melissa, 37, who was home when the incident occurred, pleaded guilty earlier this month to first-degree child abuse resulting in death. The Frederick News-Post reports that it was Melissa who got Raymond to confess to the child's cause of death, after she agreed to be wired and record a telephone conversation between her and her estranged husband, who she filed for divorce from earlier this year. 'Why did you do it to him?' she asked him, according to charging documents. 'Missy, you were right there when I did everything. You said he needed his ass beat,' Raymond responded. The couple initially said the boy had fallen down a flight of stairs and off a trampoline. Guilty: Raymond's wife Melissa (above) also pleaded guilty to child abuse, and was home when the incident occurred, lying to authorities and saying the boy fell down the stairs . Behind bars: Raymond (above) faces up to 55 years in prison if convicted on all charges .

The injuries to Robert's head were akin to those of a child who had fallen from a several-story building said the medical examiner. Even more upsetting may be the cuts found in the boys mouth, reportedly the result of Raymond brushing the boy's teeth with a wire barbecue brush. Doctors at Children's National Medical Center called it one of the worst cases of child abuse they had ever seen.

"Voters in the tiny Spanish village of Castrillo Matajudios, whose name means ""Camp Kill Jews,"" overwhelmingly decided Sunday that it's time to change the name their town has had for nearly four centuries. Mayor Lorenzo Rodriguez said the vote was 29-19 in heavy turnout for the village with just 56 registered voters about 160 miles north of Madrid. Documents show the town's original name was Castrillo Motajudios, meaning 'Jews' Hill Camp.' Castrillo Matajudios: The town has vote to change its name that it has had for 400 years . The 'Kill Jews' part of the name dates from 1627, more than a century after a 1492 Spanish royal edict ordering Jews to become Catholics or flee the country. Those who remained faced the Spanish inquisition, with many burned at the stake. Although Jews were killed in the area, researchers believe the town got its current name from Jewish residents who converted to Catholicism and wanted to reinforce their repudiation of Judaism to convince Spanish authorities of their loyalty, Rodriguez said. Others suspect the change may have come from a slip of the pen. Castrillo Matajudios wants to attract more tourists and townsfolk thought highlighting its Jewish past could help. Some residents are also embarrassed by the name. Although no Jews live in the town today, Rodriguez said many residents have ancient Jewish roots and the town's official shield includes the Star of David. Castrillo Matajudios wants to attract more tourists and townsfolk thought highlighting its Jewish past could help. Some were also embarrassed by the name . Spain's government earlier this year apologized to Jews by offering citizenship to descendants of those who were forced to flee centuries ago. Most voters who wanted a change want to revive the 'Jews' Hill Camp' name but a final decision won't happen until a town hall meeting is held in June. In Leon, Spain, ‘kill Jews’ (mata . judios) is a slang term which refers to the drinking of lemonade which . has been spiked with alcohol. There . are several theories as to when the term was coined although it almost . certainly came from medieval times, when converted Jews would sometimes . be publicly executed in show trials around Easter. Some theories suggest it was born out of the relationship in the area between Christian residents and Jewish residents. It . is one belief that the term was related to the charge of Jewish deicide . which suggested that Jewish people as a whole were responsible for the . death of Jesus Christ. Castrillo . de Matajudíos’ town mayor, Lorenzo Rodriguez, said the town was given . its name following the Spanish Inquisition began in 1478. Today, . the legacy of the Spanish Inquisition lives on in the country with the . terms ‘matar judíos’ and ‘matajudíos,’ both used in reference to the . inquisition. The term, which means ‘kill Jews’, also appears in colloquial language and place names, as well as some family names.

"The idea of losing weight while you sleep may seem too good to be true for many dieters. But, following a ground-breaking new scientific study, it could just be possible. Researchers have discovered that sleeping in the cold can help you shed pounds because the body's metabolism speeds up to keep you warm. Experts think sleeping in cooler rooms or under thinner blankets could lead the body's metabolism to speed up . The study suggests that people who sleep naked, under a thinner duvet, or who turn down their bedroom radiator could be reaping the rewards in terms of their weight. Experts from the US National Institutes of Health asked male volunteers to sleep in climate-controlled bedrooms during the experiment, to see how their temperature affected their weight. The research subjects were given identical meals to ensure they all took in the same amount of calories over the four-month period when the study took place. They were also given the same sheets and night-clothes to make sure that did not affect the experiment. The men then spent different months sleeping at different temperatures; one month at 18C, two months at 23C and one at 27C. Scientists noticed that, during the week that the men slept at the lowest temperature, their bodies changed to enable them to lose weight. A study in which men slept at different climates found their bodies changed according to the temperatures . Experts say the amount of 'brown fat', which produces heat by burning calories, doubled during the weeks at the cold temperatures, effectively speeding up the men's metabolisms. When the men slept at the higher temperatures for a month, the effect went into reverse. Francesco S. Celi, a professor at Virginia Commonwealth University, told the New York Times: 'These were all healthy young men to start with, but just by sleeping in a colder room, they gained metabolic advantages that could, over time, lessen their risk for diabetes and other metabolic problems. ' Brown fat, which produces 300 times more heat than any organ in the body and so burns off calories very quickly, is plentiful in babies but levels drop to almost zero as people become adults.","Researchers asked men to sleep in controlled temperatures for study .

"Another actor has come forward to accuse Bill Cosby of attempted sexual assault. Michelle Hurd, the actress best known for her roles on Low & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl, says she was a stand-in on the set of The Cosby Show when Cosby started acting increasingly inappropriate around her, saying, 'NEVER tell anyone what we [do] together.' What's more, she states that at least one person on set woke up at his apartment drugged on one occasion. Scroll down for video . Coming forward: Michelle Hurd (above) is the latest actress to come forward detailing her experience with Bill Cosby . Not right: Hurd, who starred on Law & Order: SVU (above) says that Cosby touch her inappropriately on the set of The Cosby Show, but she turned him down when he asked her to shower . Same story again: Ten women have come forward in the past month claiming they were at some point assaulted by Cosby (above) Hurd bravely decided to share her story on Facebook. 'LOOK, I wasn’t going to say anything, but I can’t believe some of the things i’ve been reading, SO here is MY personal experience,' she begins. 'I did stand-in work on The Cosby show back in the day and YES, Bill Cosby was VERY inappropriate with me.' She goes on to discuss being touched in ways she did not like and being asked to eat lunch with him in his dressing room. Then, things got to be too much for Hurd. 'I dodged the ultimate bullet with him when he asked me to come to his house, take a shower so we could blow dry my hair and see what it looked like straightened,' she says. 'At that point my own red flags went off and I told him, ""No, I’ll just come to work tomorrow with my hair straightened”.' Unacceptable: Hurd shared that another stand-in who worked on The Cosby Show (above) did wake up at Cosby's apartment drugged . Private person with no reason to lie: Hurd is a notoriously private actor, keeping even the date of her marriage to fellow actor Garret Dillahunt (above) out of the press . That unfortunately was not the case for another actress who Hurd began trading stories with on set. 'Turns out he was doing the same thing to her, almost by the numbers, BUT, she did go to his house and because I will not name her, and it is her story to tell, all I’ll say is she awoke, after being drugged, vomited, and then Cosby told her there’s a cab waiting for you outside.' Hurd, who is married to fellow actor Garret Dillahunt and so private that no one even knows their wedding date, then stresses that she has no reason whatsoever to lie about what happened. Andrea Constand - A Temple University employee, she claimed in 2006 that Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted her in his Philadelphia-area mansion two years earlier. Cosby eventually settled this suit out of court as the prosecution said they had 13 Jane Does who would testify Cosby did the same to them in the past. Barbara Bowman - Bowman told MailOnline that Cosby raped and drugged her back in 1985 when she was a 17-year-old aspiring actress. Bowman was one of the 13 Jane Does in the 2006 trial against Cosby. Joan Tarshis - Tarshis claimed that she was just 19-years-old when Cosby drugged and raped her twice in Hollywood back in 1969 while she was working as a writer for him. Janice Dickinson - The supermodel said in an interview that Cosby asked her to come to Lake Tahoe and talk about a television role in 1982, but ended up drugging and raping her. Tamara Green - Green, who first came forward in 2005 told MailOnline that she was an aspiring actress in the 1970s when Cosby gave her pills and pretended to care for her while she had the flu, but instead sexually assaulted her. Therese Serignese - Also one of the 13 Jane Does, she says she was 19 when Cosby drugged and raped her in Las Vegas after one of his shows. Louisa Moritz - She accused Cosby of sexual assault, saying he once forced her into oral sex, backstage at The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson in 1971, and implied he would further her career if she went through with it. Linda Joy Traitz - She said earlier this week that she was just 19 when Cosby drove her out to a beach and tried to get her to take pills to relax, before becoming 'sexually aggressive'. Traitz, of Hallandale Beach, Florida, has been charged in the past with trafficking pills. Cosby's attorney, Marty Singer, is trying to use Traitz's past to discredit her claims against his client. Beth Ferrier - Beth Ferrier claims she had relationship with Cosby in the mid-1980s. She claims that she awoke in her car with her clothes in disarray and not remembering what had happened. Ferrier has claimed that he drugged her coffee. Carla Ferrigno - The wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, claims Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. Andrea Leslie - The former model-actress claims that Cosby forced her to masturbate him in his Vegas hotel suite after giving her a strong drink in 1992. Meanwhile, Cosby's laywer, Martin Singer, has released a statement calling recent rape allegations 'increasingly ridiculous' and 'completely illogical.' 'This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards,' says Singer. 'Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end?' He then closes by saying, 'It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop.' Ten women have come forward in the last month saying they were attacked by Cosby, with Renita Chaney Hill, Louisa Moritz and Andrea Leslie the latest additions. Four of the women claim they were teenagers at the time. One of the accusers is supermodel Janice Dickinson, who claims that during a dinner in 1982 the actor gave her a pill and when she woke up he was on top of her. Another four ladies; Barbara Bowman, Joan Tarshis, Tamara Green and Therese Serignese have all shared remarkably similar stories in which they claim to have shared a drink or a pill with Cosby and then woken up after or while they say he was sexually assaulting them. Also coming forward recently is Carla Ferrigno, wife of Incredible Hulk star Lou Ferrigno, who says Cosby tried to sexually assault her during a gathering at his house in 1967. What's more, Cosby allegedly tried to use a friend to help court Ferrigno, and allegedly made his move on the former Playboy Bunny just moments after his own wife, Camille, left the room. When asked to speak about these claims in an AP interview, Cosby said he had 'no response' and 'no comment.' The new, never-before-heard claims from women who have come forward in the past two weeks with unsubstantiated, fantastical stories about things they say occurred 30, 40, or even 50 years ago have escalated far past the point of absurdity. These brand new claims about alleged decades-old events are becoming increasingly ridiculous, and it is completely illogical that so many people would have said nothing, done nothing, and made no reports to law enforcement or asserted civil claims if they thought they had been assaulted over a span of so many years. Lawsuits are filed against people in the public eye every day. There has never been a shortage of lawyers willing to represent people with claims against rich, powerful men, so it makes no sense that not one of these new women who just came forward for the first time now ever asserted a legal claim back at the time they allege they had been sexually assaulted. This situation is an unprecedented example of the media's breakneck rush to run stories without any corroboration or adherence to traditional journalistic standards. Over and over again, we have refuted these new unsubstantiated stories with documentary evidence, only to have a new uncorroborated story crop up out of the woodwork. When will it end? It is long past time for this media vilification of Mr. Cosby to stop. These allegations are already having a major impact on his work however, with Netflix postponing the airing of his new comedy special, Bill Cosby 77, which was due to air the day after Thanksgiving, and NBC pulling the plug on a comedy project they were developing with the Cosby Show star. TV Land has also announced they will no longer air reruns of The Cosby Show on the network. Despite all this, Cosby did perform in the Bahamas on Thursday and in Florida on Friday. His upcoming standup shows in Las Vegas and Arizona have however been cancelled.","Michelle Hurd, the actor known for her work on Law & Order: SVU and Gossip Girl has come forward to share her story about Bill Cosby .

"Two men who faced the death penalty for a 1975 murder have walked free from prison when all the charges against them were dismissed after a witness said his testimony was 'all lies'. Ricky Jackson and Wiley Bridgeman, 57 and 60, were convicted of murdering Harry Franks, a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio - based largely on the testimony of a 12-year-old who said he saw the murder. The two, along with Bridgeman's brother Ronnie, were given death sentences after Eddie Vernon testified in court. Scroll down for video . Free men: Wiley Bridgeman, left, and Ricky Jackson, right, were released Friday from Cuyahoga County Jail after 39 years behind bars. They were originally on death row, but had their sentences commuted to life following a Supreme Court decision in 1978 outlawing the death penalty as it then existed . Back: Bridgeman embraces his brother Ronnie, who was also convicted but let out of prison years before him . Third man: Ronnie Bridgeman, who has since changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, was also put on death row for the murders, but was released in 2003 . Crime scene: This photograph shows the aftermath of the murder for which the Bridgeman brothers and Wiley were convicted . Victim: The three men were wrongly convicted of murdering Harry Franks, a businessman in Cleveland, Ohio . All three sentences were commuted to life in 1978 after a Supreme Court ruling, but the men were still saddled with decades behind bars. Ronnie Bridgeman was released in 2003 for separate reasons. He was reunited with the other two inmates Friday when they walked free from Cuyahoga County Jail after prosecutors asked that the charges be dismissed. The dramatic turnaround came after Vernon, now 52, recanted his testimony, saying that police officers coerced him into testifying and gave him details of the case. Changing his account in 2013, he said: 'All the information was fed to me - I don't have any knowledge about what happened at the scene of the crime', Cleveland.com reported. I'm out! Jackson walks smiling out of the jail after his sentence was quashed. He said he was on 'an emotional high' from being freed . In the initial court hearings, Vernon said he was on a bus with other schoolchildren when he heard gunshots near the a grocery store called Cut-Rite. Other children on the bus have said Vernon would not have been able to see anything from his seat - and he has since admitted that was true. He now claims detectives talked him into testifying, then said if he claimed he was lying his parents could be put in prison for perjury. When he dismissed Jackson's case, Judge Richard McMonagle said, 'Life is filled with small victories, and this is a big one.' 'The English language doesn't even fit what I'm feeling,' Jackson, 57, said as he exited the building Friday. 'I'm on an emotional high.' Thankful: Jackson looks to the sky in court after a judge revoked his sentence . Bridgeman, 60, said he never lost hope that he would be freed for good. 'You keep struggling, you keep trying,' he said. Bridgeman embraced his brother Ronnie, who changed his name to Kwame Ajamu, as he walked out of the courthouse. All he could say was that he is unsure what the future holds other than a celebratory fish dinner. Ajamu told him: 'Stick with me. You'll be all right. I ain't never going to let you go.' Jackson and his lawyers planned to celebrate Friday at a hotel. Asked where he was going to live, Jackson replied: 'It's ironic. For 39 years, I've had a place to stay. Now, you know, that's precarious.' Ajamu said in an interview Thursday that the prospect of the three being together again is 'mind-boggling.' He spent his 18th birthday on death row and was in prison when his mother, a brother and a sister died. Party time: Jackson said his first plan after almost 40 years' incarceration is to have a fish dinner . He said: 'The idea that my brother - both of those guys are my brothers - are getting out? I don't even care about me.' The Bridgemans' death sentences were commuted to life in prison after the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed capital punishment in 1978. Jackson's sentence was commuted in 1977 because of a technical mistake. Their cases were first re-evaluated after a 2011 article in the Cleveland Scene magazine highlighted Vernon's unreliable testimony. Vernon broke down during a court hearing for Jackson on Tuesday as he described the threats by detectives and the burden of guilt he had carried for so long. Jackson said he holds no animosity toward Vernon. 'It took a lot of courage to do what he did,' he said. 'He's been carrying a burden around for 39 years, like we have. But in the end, he came through, and I'm grateful for that.' Joe Frolik, a spokesman for county prosecutor Tim McGinty, declined to comment on Thursday except to reiterate a statement McGinty made Tuesday: 'The state concedes the obvious.'

"It would not be everyone’s idea of getting an inside view of nature. But TV presenter Paul Rosolie has allowed himself to be swallowed alive by a snake for a documentary. The naturalist fed himself to a 30ft green anaconda in the Amazon jungle. However, the 26-year-old American took the precaution of donning a special snake-proof suit he devised to protect against the creature’s digestive juices. It is believed he was covered in pig’s blood to make himself appetising to anacondas, which usually eat wild pigs, deer, capybaras and caiman, and was pulled out by a cord attached to the suit. Scroll down for video . Belly of the beast: In Eaten Alive, filmmaker Paul Rosolie intends to don the bulky suit and then willingly feed himself the Amazonian serpent, the largest of which can measure 30 feet long . The Discovery Channel, which will air Eaten Alive on December 7, was yesterday tight-lipped about the outcome of the stunt. But insiders said the snake did not die and Rosolie has since tweeted in response to animal lovers who have accused him of cruelty and demanded the show be axed. ‘I would never hurt a living thing,’ he said. ‘But you’ll have to watch to find out how it goes down!’ Rosolie's custom snake suit, seen here briefly in a Discovery Channel video, is designed to protect the naturalist as he's . Rosolie, who has been dubbed the 'Indiana Jones of the Amazon,' specializes in the Amazon and his website biography says his experience also covers 'locations in India, Indonesia, Brazil and Peru.' Experienced or not, some have called for Discovery to cancel Rosolie's show altogether. A Change.org petition to that effect sprung up and is close to its goal of 500 signatures. 'This is animal abuse to the highest degree and absolutely disgusting, and could kill the snake - an adult green anaconda cannot fit the width of an adult man's shoulders into it's body,' reads the petition. New Jersey native Rosolie, who first ventured into the Amazon jungles of Peru at just 18, claims he's an advocate of conservation and not, it appears, just a shill for television ratings .

"A mysterious structure which has appeared in the Peruvian Amazon - and appears to be a spire surrounded by a white picket fence - is baffling scientists. The first of the structures was spotted just months ago on June 7, by Troy Alexander, a graduate student at Georgia Tech. He discovered the bizarre formation on the bottom of some blue tarpaulin close to the Tambopata Research Center, in southeastern Peru. Intricate structures that resemble white picket fences surrounding a spire have been discovered in the Peruvian Amazon . He then found three more of the enclosures on tree trunks in the jungle, Wired.com reports. He told the site the fences measured around two centimeters across. He has since posted pictures on websites to find out their origin and any detail explaining what they are. To date - no one has been able to identify the structures. Phil Torres, a biologist  from Tambopata, posted a link on Twitter to the pictures, equally baffled as to their origin. To discover what the structures were, or which creature had made them, Alexander posted photos, pictured, on various websites asking for any detail that could explain their origin. Many scientists and experts said they had no idea how the structures had been made . As well as trying to determine the species, researchers still don't know what the spiders build and use the unique web structures, pictured, for. Cremer believes that the walls may be used to capture tiny mites, or could be used as camouflage . William Eberhard, an entomologist with the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute told the site he had no idea what made it or what it was. Norm Platnick, curator emeritus of spiders at the American Museum of Natural History, added: 'I’ve seen the photo, but have no idea what animal might be responsible.' Linda Rayor, of Cornell University, hazarded a guess that it might be a 'lacewing' but admitted she did not know either what it was. Some have suggested it was created by the Urodidae family or species, known for weaving basket-like cocoons, or that it is an incomplete cocoon, or the work of a moth in the Bucculatricidae family.","Structure found by Troy Alexander, a graduate student at Georgia Tech .

"A Russian petrol station worker has been given a bravery award after stopping an explosion at a garage. Arsene Fitsulaev managed to seal the valves of a damaged fuel tanker just before the petrol surrounding it caught fire, preventing a huge explosion. The incident begins as a black car attempts a routine manouvre on a garage forecourt. Scroll down for video . A man has been given a bravery award in Russia after dashing into a cloud of petrol fumes and fuel in order to prevent a damaged tank from exploding . Accident: The debacle begins when a hapless driver tries to turn around on the garage forecourt . Damage: He misjudges his manouvre, clipping a fuel pipe on this tanker causing it to rupture . However the bungling driver misjudges his turn, clipping the fuel tap on a tanker sitting in front of him. The pipe twists to one side, releasing highly flammable gas and leaking petrol all over the floor. As the motorist makes a hasty getaway Arsene can be seen running into shot, plunging into the midst of the toxic fumes in order to get to the taps in time. Not sticking around: However the motorist quickly flees the scene leaving gas and petrol leaking out . Into action: With the driver on his way out, Arsene comes running over in order to fix the tank . Fearless: Without a thought for his safety Arsene runs into the flammable smog in order to turn off the taps . Without a thought for his own life, Arsene can be seen desperately trying to turn off the fuel taps while surrounded by the gas. After a few seconds he has the valves safely sealed off, which is just as well because moments later the petrol reaches the road in front of the station, and is ignited by a passing car. In a fraction of a second the gas and petrol ignite, starting a blaze which completely consumes the garage forecourt, engulfing a parked car and gutting it. Fixed: With moments to spare Arsene seals off the valves before retreating back to safety . Just in time: Within moments a spark has ignited the fuel sending flames rushing across the parking lot . Burning: It takes milliseconds for the fuel to ignite, engulfing the parked car and gutting it . But as bad as it looks the incident could have been much worse had it not been for Arsene's quick thinking, because when the petrol and gas set alight it was dispersed and so simply burned away. If the flame had been able to track back up an open valve and into the tank where there was more fuel confined to a tight space, it would almost certainly have caused a huge explosion. In recognition of his efforts, Arsene's local rescue team in Kaspiysk have given him a bravery award. Consumed: The flames surround the tank, but luckily there is no explosion . Lucky escape: Because the gas and fuel outside the tanker was dispersed it simply burned away, but had the fuel inside caught fire in the confined space it would have exploded .

"This incredible image shows how our skies will look when the Milky Way galaxy collides with our cosmic neighbour, the Andromeda galaxy, in four billion years. Astronomers at NASA have confirmed that, according to their latest models, a major collision will occur in a major cosmic event. The head-on encounter is expected to happen four billion years from now - catapulting our sun to another area of the galaxy, with stars tossed on to different orbits, astronomers at the Space Telescope Science Institute revealed on Thursday. Starting off as a tiny speck in the distance, the galaxy known as Andromeda (left of the picture) looks harmless at first . Previously just a small dot, earthlings of the future would be forgiven for panicking as Andromeda moves closer to our galaxy . The formerly tiny galaxy now dominates the foreground of the computer generated image as it swallows up the Milky Way . The Aftermath: Following the collision of the two galaxies, a countless number of stars will be sent spinning into space as Andromeda and the Milky Way lose their previous forms . Although Earth and its solar system won't be destroyed, it will be pushed away from the galactic core more than it is now. 'After nearly a century of speculation about the future destiny of Andromeda and our Milky Way, we at last have a clear picture of how events will unfold over the coming billions of years,' said Sangmo Tony Sohn, Baltimore, Maryland-based institute. After the Andromeda galaxy finally strikes the Milky Way, it will be another two billion years before the two totally come together and form a single elliptical galaxy. Colossal: This NASA illustration shows the Milky Way (left) and the Andromeda galaxy, which are expected to collide in four billion years from now . Impact: Earth won't be destroyed when Andromeda smashes into the Milky Way (pictured), but stars will likely be tossed into different orbits and it will take an additional two billion years for the two galaxies to totally merge . A mutual pull of gravity is bringing . the two galaxies together as Andromeda, known to scientists as M31, . falls at a ferocious rate toward the Milky Way. Andromeda is currently 2.5million light-years away. 'In the 'worst-case scenario' simulation, M31 slams into the Milky Way head-on and the stars are all scattered into orbits,' said team member Gurtina Besla in a statement. The Andromeda is plowing toward Earth's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour. That rate is the equivalent of traveling from Earth to the moon in an hour. Astronomers also believe a third, smaller galaxy called the Triangulum will also be a part of the collision and could join the Milky Way and Andromeda mash-up. Fast: Andromeda (pictured) is plowing toward Earth's galaxy at roughly 250,000 miles per hour, which is the equivalent of traveling from Earth to the moon in 60 minutes . It previously had been difficult to determine whether the two galaxies would slam into each other. Members of the NASA Hubble Space . Telescope team, however, were able to make certain that the two will . crash with exact views of Andromeda's sideways motion. Change: When the two galaxies collide, the sun (pictured) will be catapulted across another area of the galaxy . 'This was accomplished by repeatedly observing select regions of the galaxy over a five- to seven-year period,' said the institute's Jay Anderson, in a statement. The astronomers used extremely powerful cameras to capture the measurements that were crucial to understand the motion of Andromeda. As the universe expands and accelerates, collisions can happen between two galaxies close together because of the gravity from dark matter around them. These types of mergers were more likely to happen in the past when the universe was not as large as it is today.","Collision between galaxies will happen in four billion years .

"Slapping on sunscreen could reduce a man's ability to have a baby, according to new research. A study found that chemicals commonly found in sunscreen, which filter out UV rays, can impair male fertility. Experts warned when these chemicals are absorbed by the skin, they can interfere with the body's hormones. Men exposed to specific chemicals called BP-2 or 4OH-BP had a 30 per cent reduction in fertility. Chemicals which filter out UV rays - commonly found in sunscreens, shampoos and moisturisers can impair male fertility. Men exposed to two chemicals - BP-2 or 4OH-BP - had their fertility reduced by 30 per cent . However it was unclear whether they damaged sperm quality or inhibited fertility in another way. The group of chemicals, called benzophenone-type ultraviolet filters, are commonly used in sun, shampoo, moisturisers and other cosmetics to protect the skin and hair from sun damage. Interestingly, the chemicals affected male fertility, but not female, the researchers noted. While women were more exposed to UV filters overall, this wasn't associated with a delay to them becoming pregnant. Previous research has linked high concentrations of phthalates - chemicals found in plastics - to reduced fertility in men. The same effect was seen in men exposed to high levels of the chemical Bisphenol A (BPA), found in plastic bottles. As part of the study, researchers studied 501 couples who were trying to conceive a child, recruited between 2005 and 2009. The couples were part of the Longitudinal Investigation of Fertility and the Environment (LIFE) study, established to examine how lifestyle factors and exposure to environmental chemicals affects fertility. The women ranged from 18 to 44 years of age, and the men were over 18. None of the them had been diagnosed as infertile. The researchers followed the couples for one year until they became pregnant or kept trying, in order to record the time it took for the women to become pregnant. They also tested their urine samples and measured for concentrations of five selected UV filters previously shown to disrupt the body's hormone and endocrine system. In their analysis of the data, the researchers controlled for age, body mass index, and smoking, among other factors. Some, but not all, UV filters may be associated with diminished fertility in men, whether their partners were exposed or not, they found. Researchers advise men to keep using sunscreen to protect against skin cancer. But if they are worried about fertility they could was it off when they go indoors and cut down on other products containing UV filters . The largest effect was seen in men with the highest exposure to the chemicals. 'The skin is the body's largest organ, and how we care for our skin matters in more ways than one,' said Dr Germaine Louis,  National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. 'Sunscreen is important for sun protection, and we definitely encourage people to continue using sunscreen to avoid skin cancer. 'But men who are concerned about fertility may be interested in other ways to reduce their exposure to benzophenone UV filters - whether by cutting back on other products that contain the UV filters or by washing after returning indoors.' 'Our next step is to figure out how these particular chemicals may be affecting couple fecundity or time to pregnancy - whether it's by diminishing sperm quality or inhibiting reproduction some other way.' However, the researchers admitted they tested urine samples from the couples once, but this may have changed over the months they were trying to conceive a baby. The study findings were published online in the American Journal of Epidemiology.","Offending group of chemicals called benxophenone-type ultraviolet filters .

"Police in New Jersey say Jeannine LePage used a pillow to muffle the sounds of gunfire when she shot her three children, one by one, as they lay in her bed before turning the gun on herself Thursday. The murder and attempted suicide took place at a home in Tabernacle Township in southern New Jersey, leaving  left children dead and their mother and brother wounded. A relative found the four family members shot in a bed Thursday morning. Police say 14-year-old Nicholas Harriman and his 8-year-old sister, Nadia, were killed. Mrs LePage and 11-year-old Alexander Harriman were in critical condition Friday. Scroll down for videos . Family tragedy: Jeannine LePage, 44, is accused of shooting dead her 14-year-old son and 8-year-old daughter, and wounding her 11-year-old son, before turning the gun on herself in New Jersey . Scene: Members of law enforcement are seen outside the Tabernacle home where two children were found dead and a woman and another boy were found injured . State police said they received a call from another relative in the home at about 9.15am Thursday reporting that the mother and children had been shot. Jeannine LePage, 44, had a single shot to her head; officials would not say where the children were shot. So young: Nadia Harriman, 8, was shot dead in bed at the hands of her own mother, according to police . All were found in the same room, and a revolver believed to have been the only weapon used was found, police said. LePage and her 11-year-old son, Alexander, were taken to Cooper University Hospital in Camden. Officials described them both as being in ‘extremely critical condition,’ suggesting that they are not expected to survive. Five other people live in the home, but authorities say none reported hearing any shooting because the mother used a pillow to muffle the sounds of gunfire. Authorities said all the other residents of the home had been accounted for. During a press conference Friday, State police Detective Geoff Noble said LePage used a handgun that had been purchased legally and was in the family for decades. Authorities have not said what prompted the mother to shoot her children. ‘We may never know with certainty, depending on the condition of LePage, what that motive was,’ New Jersey State Police Captain Stephen Jones said. ‘That's something we're not prepared to address right now.’ After autopsies of the two children, police were able to narrow the time frame of the shooting to somewhere between 5am and 9am Thursday. The Burlington County community is located in the sparsely populated New Jersey Pinelands, about 30 miles east of Philadelphia. Victims: One of two children's bodies are taken from the crime scene after the shooting . Crime: A police line is secured in Tabernacle, where the four shooting victims were found inside a home . Distraught: A woman covers her hand as she speaks with investigators on Thursday . Neighbors said they did not know the residents of the house and did not hear any commotion Thursday morning until troopers arrived and helicopters began hovering overhead.

"The Republicans are set to win the overall control of the Senate, according to new polling which gives the GOP leads in almost all the key battleground states. New surveys from NBC News/Marist give the party leads over the opposition in Colorado, Arkansas and Iowa, which could lead to power in the upper house changing hands for the first time in eight years. It comes as their Democrat opponents took a beating in a separate poll - which registered the highest disapproval from the party across all of Congress in 20 years. Scroll down for video .

"A Connecticut teacher who repeatedly had sex with one of her teenage students in her car threatened to fail him when he tried to break off their affair, police have said. Danielle Watkins, who is married with two young children, also sent the 18-year-old nude pictures during their eight-month relationship and supplied him and a friend with marijuana, cops said. The 32-year-old teacher, who taught English at Stamford High School, turned herself into authorities in Stamford on Thursday and has been charged with sexual assault, among other charges. The affair was revealed when the teen told a school counselor about their relationship in June. The counselor then alerted the Department of Children and Families and the Board of Education. 'Affair': Danielle Watkins, pictured left and in her mug shot right, allegedly had an eight-month sexual relationship with an 18-year-old student. She also allegedly provided him with marijuana . The boy waited until he had finished classes before going to authorities because, when he previously tried to call off the affair, Watkins said she would fail him and accused him of seeing someone else. The pair allegedly had sex numerous times in her car as it was parked off school property during school hours, The Courant reported. Watkins, a teacher for nine years, also allegedly bought marijuana for him and a 15-year-old friend - whom she also taught - and let him drive her car while knowing he did not have a license. Her two students smoked the drug during school hours, sometimes on school grounds, the older boy told police. On June 26, three days after telling the counselor about the affair, he went to Stamford Police to make a statement about the relationship. The 15-year-old boy also gave a statement to police. Family: Watkins, an English teacher who allegedly threatened to fail the boy when he tried to break off their relationship, is pictured with her husband and one of their children . On June 27, police officers pulled over Watkins' car and inside they found marijuana and a cell phone, which contained evidence she had sent naked photos of herself to the boy. Lt. Diedrich Hohn, in charge of the . case, told MailOnline that she was 'hostile' and 'verbally . combative' during the search. As cops pulled her over, she had tried to hide her cellphone under the . passenger seat, he said. Watkins allegedly exchanged more than 2,000 text messages and hundreds of phone calls with the teenager. On Thursday, she was charged her with sexual assault and sale of marijuana in regard to the first victim and sale of marijuana and risk of injury to a minor in connection with the younger boy. She was released on $100,000 bond and she is scheduled to appear in court July 31. Scene: She met him at Stamford High School in Connecticut, pictured, but is now on administrative leave .

"Sally Bercow was accused of demeaning the office of Speaker yesterday after publicly refusing to attend the funeral of Margaret Thatcher. Mrs Bercow was invited to the ceremony at St Paul’s Cathedral only because she is the wife of John Bercow, who presided over the Commons debate celebrating the life of Baroness Thatcher. But yesterday she said she would not go because she does not want to join in the ‘attempted canonisation’ of the late prime minister. Speaking her mind: Sally Bercow , pictured with her husband, Commons Speaker John Bercow, will not be attending Lady Thatcher's funeral . Mrs Bercow, an outspoken Labour supporter, said: ‘As Commons Speaker, John will be attending the funeral – and rightly so. But I’m not obliged to participate in my husband’s public life – last time I looked, this was the 21st century! John holds public office and an important position, not me. ‘Although I’m genuinely sorry that Baroness Thatcher has passed away, I’m not going to be a hypocrite and join in this attempted canonisation of her.’ Mrs Bercow also accused No 10 of leaking details of her decision not to go to the Press to try to undermine her husband. She said: ‘I’m astonished that Cameron’s people haven’t got better things to do! 'It’s a predictably pathetic attempt to cause trouble for the Speaker – which has utterly failed – and a complete non-story. Margaret Thatcher wouldn’t have given a monkey’s whether or not I attended her funeral.’ Grieving: Sir Mark Thatcher leaving his mother's house in Chester Square, in London's Belgravia, today . Former Prime Minister Lady Thatcher being comforted by her grandson Michael Thatcher outside the memorial service of her late husband, Sir Denis Thatcher in 2003 . Friends and allies of Lady Thatcher reacted with withering scorn to Mrs Bercow’s attempt to grab the limelight. Tory . MP Conor Burns praised Mr Bercow for his handling of the Commons debate . but accused his wife of seeking to be the centre of attention. He . said: ‘I have to say this, John Bercow handled Tuesday brilliantly. He . got exactly  the right tone. Actually, Lady T was a bit of a Bercow fan. 'As for Sally, there’s the old saying: “She wants to be the bride at . every wedding and the corpse at every funeral”. ‘I . don’t think Margaret was terribly interested in what she thought when . she was alive. I don’t think it will bother her in death that she is not . at St Paul’s on Wednesday.’ Fellow . Tory MP Rob Wilson said Mrs Bercow’s views were ‘utterly irrelevant to . both  Parliament and the country’, adding: ‘Margaret Thatcher is a . colossal political figure whose place in history is assured – why . anybody would care what the wife of the Speaker thinks is beyond me.’ Loyal aide: Baroness Margaret Thatcher and Lord McAlpine, who has been invited to her funeral, in 2000 .

"Earlier this week, scientists came up with an evolutionary explanation for kissing which was far from romantic. Kissing helps partners share millions of bacteria, shoring up their immune systems and enabling them to better fight disease, they said. As 80 million bacteria are transferred from mouth to mouth in a single ten-second kiss, some people might brand the act 'unhygenic'. In fact, you're more likely to become ill after far less intimate contact, such as shaking someone's hand, an expert has claimed. Kissing is nature's 'litmus test' helping us to choose a potential partner. We subconsciously smell our future mate and look for those with different immune systems to our own so future children can fight disease . Here, Sheril Kirshenbaum, the author of The Science of Kissing and Director of the Energy Poll at University of Texas at Austin, gives her view - and explains why kissing is so sensual... The finding that we share about 80 million bacteria during a passionate ten-second kiss makes puckering up seem cringe-worthy – and downright unsanitary at the start of cold and flu season. But take heart: we're more likely to get sick by shaking hands throughout the day than through kissing. And the science behind this behaviour reveals that along with all of those germs, we share plenty of benefits with a partner as well. Kissing is not all about bacterial exchange or romance, however. Our first experiences with love and security usually involve lip pressure and stimulation through behaviours that mimic kissing, like nursing or bottle feeding. These early events lay down important neural pathways in a baby's brain that associate kissing with positive emotions that continue to be important in throughout his life. And our lips are the body's most exposed erogenous zone. Unlike in other animals, human lips are uniquely everted, meaning they purse outwardly. Our first experiences of love and security, like being fed from a bottle, mimic kissing . They are packed with sensitive nerve endings so even the slightest brush sends a cascade of information to our brains, which can feel very good. Kissing activates a very large part of the brain associated with sensory information. Kisses work their magic by setting off a whirlwind of neurotransmitters and hormones through our bodies that influence how we think and feel. KISSING CODES . If there's real 'chemistry' between two people, a kiss can set the stage for a new romance. A passionate kiss puts two people in very close proximity – nose to nose. We learn about each other by engaging our sense of smell, our taste buds and sense of touch. And through that information all sorts of signals are being sent to our brain informing us about the other person. In fact, the scent of man can provide subconscious clues about his DNA to his partner. Evolutionary psychologists at the State University of New York at Albany found that 59 per cent of men and 66 per cent of women say they have ended a budding relationship because a kiss didn't go well. It's nature's ultimate litmus test, nudging us to be most attracted to the people that may be the best genetic partners. Research by Swiss biologist Claus Wedekind found women are most attracted to the scents of men who carry a different genetic code for their immune system in a region of DNA known as the major histocompatibility complex or MHC. However, women who take contraceptive pills show preferences towards men with immune systems similar to their own . Scientists suspect that when a couple who carry distinctly different genetics for fighting disease, their children are likely to benefit by having a strong immune system. We may not exactly be thinking about parenthood when we connect with someone at the lips, but kissing provides clues to help us decide whether to take a relationship further. However, it's important to add that women who take the birth control pill show the opposite preference toward men with MHC genetics most like their own. This suggests that when we are on contraceptives, we may be fooling our bodies in more ways than we realise. GETTING HOT UNDER THE COLLAR . Aside from helping us find a great match, kissing has other perks as well. It sets off a cascade of neural impulses that bounce between the brain and the tongue, lips, facial muscles, and skin. Billions of little nerve connections distribute information around the body, producing chemical signals that change the way we feel. A passionate kiss can spike the neurotransmitter dopamine, which is linked to feelings of craving and desire. Oxytocin, known as the 'love hormone,' fosters a sense of closeness and attachment. Adrenaline boosts our heart rate and can make us start sweating as our bodies begin to anticipate what might occur later. Cortisol, known as the stress hormone, also dips to reduce uneasiness. Blood vessels dilate, breathing can deepen, cheeks flush and our pulse quickens. Kissing also sparks the production of hormones that make us fall in love, as well as solidifying the bonds we share with family members and friends . Kissing fosters the sensations we often describe when we are falling in love. In this way, a kiss can herald in a new romantic relationship. It can also solidify the strong bonds we share with family members and friends. Kisses come in many varieties and are inherently tied to the most meaningful and significant moments of our lives by providing a means to communicate beyond what words can convey. Science has barely begun to study kissing, despite its obvious evolutionary and personal significance, but what we already know demonstrates that there's a lot more to going on than meets the eyes – and lips. This article was written for The Conversation website.","Sheril Kirshenbaum is the author of The Science of Kissing .

"Kazakhstan today issued an official ‘thank you’ to Sacha Baron Cohen for his comedy character Borat who lampooned its people. His 2006 film depicting a mock Kazakh TV journalist led to a huge boost in tourism and helped put the oil-rich former Soviet state on the map, Foreign Minister Yerzhan Kazykhanov admitted in parliament. 'I salute ‘Borat’ for helping attract tourists to Kazakhstan,' he said. Offense: Sacha Baron Cohen as Borat was initially met with outrage by Kazachstan .

Cringewothy: The viewing of the Borta movie was painful for Kazachstan - but the interest in the country is caused led to a tenfold increase in visa requests . Among the lyrics was the verse: 'Kazakhstan’s prostitutes cleanest in the region. 'Except of course Turkmenistan’s' The Kazakh embassy in London was put under 'strict orders' to ensure British officials are aware of the correct anthem to ensure no embarrassing repeat at the London Olympics in July. Kazakh competitors are also being trained in their own anthem so they can immediately protest if the spoof version in played. Many of the country’s Olympic team are ethnic Russians who do not speak Kazakh, so they are being given a crash course in the words.","Foreign Minister reveals visa requests have increased tenfold since 2006 film .

"The US Army confirmed Monday that Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl is returning to active duty just four weeks on from his return to the United States after five years as a Taliban captive - and will be working behind a desk. In a phone interview with MailOnline, Col. Scott Bleichwell said 'It's an office job within the headquarters - just general office work.' Bleichwehl explained that Bergdahl will also have a sponsor, which he described as 'a person who's designated, not only for him, but for every soldier in Army North [...] and assists with assimilating into the unit.' The sponsor helps with 'very basic administrative functions,' Bleichwehl said, which include '[helping become] a part of the unit, processing records, becoming familiar with the day to day schedule.' 'We're always there for every soldier,' he said. Bergdahl may also receive $350,000 from the US government without paying taxes: $200,000 would be for wages earned during his captivity and $150,000 if he in fact was a prisoner of war, according to Fox News. Return to duty: This is Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl six weeks ago at his handover by the Taliban to US forces.  The US Army said Monday he will return to active duty . Responding to that report, Army spokeswoman Lt. Col. Alayne Conway told MailOnline 'The Army's determination of Sgt. Bergdahl's eligibility for pay and benefits will be in accordance with the appropriate laws, regulations and policies. Pay is always linked to duty status.' In a statement, the Army said that the soldier 'has completed the final phase of the reintegration process under the control of U.S. Army South and is currently being assigned to U.S. Army North, Joint Base San Antonio-Fort Sam Houston (JBSA).' 'He will now return to regular duty within the command where he can contribute to the mission. The Army investigation into the facts and circumstances surrounding the disappearance and capture of Bergdahl is still ongoing.' According to the New York Times, Bergdahl was in therapy at Fort Sam Houston. Since his return from Afghanistan, Sgt. Bergdahl has been involved in debriefings with his superiors, the newspaper said. Just last week, a photo of Bergdahl, . smiling and posing with a former senior Taliban official in Afghanistan . was posted on Twitter. This photo of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, smiling and posing with Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani, a senior member of the Haqqani network in Afghanistan, was posted on Twitter on Wednesday . The . Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) confirmed Bergdahl was photographed next to Taliban Commander Badruddin Haqqani. The son of Jalaluddin Haqqani, he reportedly worked in the Haqqani organization and . was killed in a U.S. drone strike in August 2012, CNN said at the time. Former POW Bergdahl was controversially released by the Taliban in May in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees. Soldiers who served with Bergdahl before he . left his post in Afghanistan in 2009 told Fox News they have still not been . contacted by military investigators. Questions: A new investigation has been launched to determine whether Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, pictured, deserted his post or went AWOL when he was reported missing in Afghanistan in 2009 . Left out: Former platoon leader and Army Sgt. Evan Buetow, pictured in a previous Fox interview, said he believes the investigators have already made up their mind about what happened . 'I think it's very clear he . deserted his post,' Army Sgt. Evan Buetow told FoxNews.com. 'He thought about what he . was doing, he mailed some things home, he walked away and we have . witnesses who saw him walking away. 'And if you’re walking away in one of . the worst, most dangerous areas of Afghanistan without your weapon and . gear, I don’t believe you’re planning on coming back.' Former Army Sgt. Evan Buetow . Of the investigation, Buetow added: 'They've already concluded what they want to be said. They know exactly what happened.' Former . Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant also told Fox News 'I . have confidence that they're going to do what’s right,' Vierkant said. 'I just feel this should've happened a long time ago and it should've . been public.' Both Buetow and Vierkant told Fox they believe Bergdahl deserted his unit. Speaking out: Former Army Sgt. Matt Vierkant, pictured in a previous interview on CNN, also said he had not been contacted by Army officials and believes that Bergdahl deserted the unit .","Sgt.

"A British man has been sentenced to six months in prison by a Dubai court for pinching a woman's bottom in a bar. Businessman Steven Sherriff, 43, was sentenced in his absence after being accused of groping a 23-year-old whilst on a bar crawl. The investor, who lived in Dubai for seven years, was punched unconscious by the woman's livid boyfriend after also allegedly touching the woman between her legs. There are more than 100,000 Britons who live in Dubai, and a string of cases have highlighted the difficulties for them of living in the strict Muslim emirate . He denies all wrongdoing, however, and has slammed the decision of the Dubai court. Mr Sherriff told The Sun: 'This is insane. How can I be found guilty when one of the witnesses says I didn't do it? 'If I go to jail, it is going to ruin everything.' His wife Betina has also leapt to the defence of her husband, saying: 'He doesn't even know how to flirt, let alone do this.' Belfast-born Mr Sherriff had been advised by his lawyer not to attend court this week to hear the verdict against him. The 43-year-old has vowed to appeal against his sentence. The case highlights the difficulties faced by more than 100,000 Britons who live in Dubai. In 2008, Michelle Palmer, of Oakham, was accused of having sex on Jumeirah Beach in Dubai . Officials in the Gulf state have prosecuted several Britons for indecent behaviour over the past five years. In 2008, Vince Acors, of Bromley, Kent, and Michelle Palmer, of Oakham, Rutland, were given three-month jail terms for having sex on Jumeirah Beach. They claimed they had simply been 'kissing and cuddling' and the sentences were suspended on appeal. In 2010, estate agent Charlotte Adams and Ayman Najafi were jailed for one month by a Dubai court for kissing and fondling each other in a restaurant – a breach of strict decency laws. Earlier this year, a British businesswoman was accused of having drunken sex in the back of a Dubai taxi. Rebecca Blake, 29, from Dorking, Surrey, was sacked from her £100,000 a year job as a recruitment consultant after her alleged tryst with Irish welder Conor McRedmond. Foreigners jailed in Dubai are deported immediately after completing their sentences.","Belfast-born Steven Sherriff has denied all wrongdoing and says going to prison will 'ruin everything'

"Hurdler: John Deeds was filmed leaping over a garden fence, despite receiving disability living allowance on claims he needed help to rise from bed . A convicted fraudster who claimed it took him five minutes to stagger seven yards was revealed as a benefits cheat after he was filmed hurdling a garden fence. John Deeds, 44, was awarded a high rate of disability living allowance on the grounds he was barely mobile. He claimed he even needed help getting out of bed. But undercover officials from the Department of Work and Pensions secretly filmed him after becoming suspicious about his claims. Deeds, from Blackley, Greater Manchester, was caught on camera breaking into a jog before hopping over the a garden fence. The nimble benefits cheat was also recorded climbing over the same fence while carrying a vacuum cleaner. Other footage showed him cleaning a van and even pushing someone else in a heavy wheelchair. The cheat has now been jailed for four weeks after pleading guilty to a charge of failing to notify the DWP of an improvement in his condition. Deeds is already serving a 40-month sentence after being exposed as an identity fraudster. Originally called Anthony Wolff, he changed his name by deed poll eight times and used a total of 17 different names to obtain goods and money worth £288,204. Posing as a successful company boss, he duped a string of businesses into giving him credit on false pretences. He admitted 12 counts of fraud, two counts of perverting the course of justice, and retaining unlawful credit. Nimble: Deeds captured on video by officials from the Department of Work and Pensions hopping over a garden fence . Energetic: Deeds is pictured again negotiating the fence - this time carrying a vacuum cleaner . As well as the jail term, to stop Deeds from carrying out future scams the Crown Prosecution Service and Greater Manchester Police secured a Serious Crime Prevention Order preventing him from being known by any other name. The order bars Deeds from using other names, having more than one bank account, applying for credit or trade insurance or launching a lawsuit without first telling GMP’s fraud team. The latest sentence, handed out at Manchester magistrates court, will run concurrently with the one he is already serving. Strong: Deeds pushes a person in a heavy wheelchair . The court heard Deeds received benefit payments of £9,359 to which he was not entitled. Lord Freud, minister for welfare reform, said after the case: 'We have a duty to the taxpayer and our customers to make sure that these vital benefits only go to those who need them. Benefit fraud takes money away from the most vulnerable. 'It is a crime and we are committed to stopping it by catching criminals and making sure our reforms make the benefit system less open to abuse.'","John Deeds is currently serving a 40-month sentence for a separate string of frauds worth nearly £300,000 .

"Towering battlements, a pair of knights jousting on horseback and a terrifying dragon took centre stage as a magical kingdom made entirely from ice was unveiled as the centrepiece of Hyde Park's new Winter Wonderland. The event has become an annual fixture in the London events calendar, and the kingdom has already had a visit from a real royal, after Princess Beatrice became one of the first through its doors last night. Winter Wonderland, which opens to the public today, also boasts an ice slide, a huge ice rink, an ice bar and a colourful Christmas market that boasts stallholders drawn from all over Europe. Opening to the public tomorrow at 5pm, the Magical Ice Kingdom is one of the most popular attractions of Hyde Park's Winter Wonderland . Some of the smaller pieces that make up the vast kingdom will have been started being carved as early as July . Over a hundred intricate ice sculptures have been painstakingly carved by over 50 artists from around the world for the exhibition . The exhibition is sure to be a hit with children such as Isabella Hope and Ida Bergsmed (pictured), who are able to sit on ice thrones . Illuminated by dramatic floor lighting, translucent dragons, castles, woodland creatures and even beer barrels are on display . Spectacular though they are, it is the awe-inspiring Magical Kingdom that looks set to be the highlight of this year's event - thanks in no small part to the 100 individual ice sculptures. 50 ice artists took two week to create the kingdom, carving most of the scenes on site in the specially created dome, which is kept at a chilly minus 10 degrees. Though the majority of the sculptures were created in Hyde Park, the enormity of the exhibition meant that some of the smaller pieces were begun as early as July in the various sculptors' studios. The biggest ice exhibition in the world, completing the Magical Ice Kingdom required an astonishing 250 tonnes of snow and 100 tonnes of ice - all of which had to be specially shipped to London.

"A woman charged with drink driving after consuming four bottles of wine in three hours  recorded the highest blood alcohol level a Victorian court had ever seen. Ruth Spycella, 48, allegedly drank the alcohol between 8.30am and 11.30am on July 24, before driving around Geelong and crashing into the back of a parked off-duty police car. When police attended the scene, Ms Spychella, from Clifton Springs, recorded an astounding blood alcohol level of .423, which magistrate Ann McGarvie said was the highest she had ever seen in a person who was alive, reported news.com.au. A woman charged with drink driving after consuming four bottles of wine in three hours recorded the highest blood alcohol level a Victorian court had ever seen . Ms Spychella was driving when she crossed onto the wrong side of the road, mounted the curb and collided head on with the car, and was later pulled from the vehicle slurring her words. She smelled strongly of alcohol and had to be carried to the ambulance, and was taken to Geelong Hospital where she was administered the blood alcohol test. The Geelong Magistrates Court found Ms Spychella guilty of exceeding the .05 blood alcohol limit and of careless driving. Police prosecutor, Leading Senior Constable Kerrie Moroney, said that it was possible for Ms Spychella to have drunk four bottles of wine in the three hour time frame. 'She did not recall driving along Beacon Point Rd or turning into Camberwarra Ave,' Senior Constable Moroney said. When police attended the scene, Ms Spychella, from Clifton Springs, recorded an astounding blood alcohol level of .423 . Dr Alex Wodak, President of the Australian Drug Law Reform Foundation said that the blood alcohol was certainly very high, and indicated not only the driving incident she had been charged with but also posed a serious health issue. 'If a person is not tolerant to drinking alcohol very frequently, then that level of alcohol would have made it impossible for her to control her body, or even to speak,' Dr Wodak said. 'The fact that she was capable of driving a vehicle indicates that she was very tolerant to alcohol and to drinking at high levels.' Ruth Spycella, 48, allegedly drank the alcohol between 8.30am and 11.30am on July 24, before driving around Geelong and crashing into the back of a parked off-duty police car . Ms Spychella's defense council, Richard Concha, said that she had been suffering from alcohol and anxiety for 13 years, and that she was currently undergoing rehabilitation. Mr Concha said 'I don’t know how she was alive, let alone able to move,' reported The Courier Mail. Dr Wodak said that the risk of having a car crash increases 'quite spectacularly' with the consumption of alcohol, doubling at .05 blood alcohol and tripling at .08. Geelong Magistrates Court heard that it was the highest blood alcohol the court had ever seen in a living person . 'There have not been many people who have been recorded with a breath alcohol concentration of that level. It's not the world record but it's extremely high.' 'The problems that people have when they drunk range from their judgement and reaction time decreasing, to being less able to cope with multiple tasks and have focus or attention,' he said. 'It's not just creating defects in one area of driving performance, it's in all of them.' Ms Spychella was ordered to serve 120 hours of community service under a two-year community corrections order.","Ruth Spychella allegedly drank four bottles of wine between 8.30am and 11.30am before climbing into her car .

"One victim in California was left looking like he had been shot in the face, while police in Florida first believed another was stabbed. But two were actually injured during minor car crashes, and what eventually killed them wasn't a deadly hazard inside the vehicle but instead  a supposed safety feature. Investigators tied the horrific outcomes to airbags manufactured by the Japanese company Takata, 8 million of which were recalled by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Scroll down for video . Victim: A lawsuit alleges that Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando was struck by plastic and metal shrapnel after a Takata airbag deployed in her 2001 Honda Accord during a minor accident . The  airbags are equipped in cars made by 10 different auto manufacturers, though 5 million of these are used in Honda and Acura models, CNN Money reports. Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando died in October after four days in the hospital after a minor crash in her 2001 Honda Accord that caused the airbag to deploy. Police believed she'd been the victim of a stabbing, and even investigated a 'person of interest' according to her family's lawsuit. That was before an autopsy last week that revealed metal and plastic fragments from an exploding airbag caused her death. After he ran his 2002 Acura TL into a wall in 2013, Devin Xu, 47, died in a similar way as Tran, though investigators originally thought he'd been the victim of a shooting. Reuters reports that two others were killed with wounds to the neck after their airbags exploded following a crash, with nine other serious injuries. Deadly: A metal component of the airbag that critically injured Tran is shown, as Takata deals with allegations that their airbags have caused numerous fatalities while the company covered up faulty parts . One case from 2010 didn't involve a crash at all. Instead, a lawsuit claims that Kristy Williams was stopped at a red light in her 2001 Honda Civic when the airbag deployed. Metal fragments sliced into her neck, hitting her carotid artery, and Williams was only able to survive by placing two fingers into the wound to limit the bleeding. Afterwards, the lawsuit alleges, she suffered strokes and was left with traumatic brain injury. Honda has repeatedly expanded recalls of models equipped with Takata airbags, including Accord, Civic and Acura, and had to re-issue recalls in 2011 after it earlier replacement parts were believed to be defective as well. In October, Reuters found Takata's manufacturing plant in Monclava, Mexico, had a difficult time keeping up with the company's internal safety standards. Earlier this month, the New York Times published an investigation that found Takata conducted tests in 2004 that showed inflaters cracking when airbags were deployed. When they learned of these results, Takata executives told researchers to delete their data and trash the faulty inflaters, according to two former employees. Investigators from the NHTSA are also looking into whether high humidity plays a role in causing Takata inflaters to malfunction.","Hien Thi Tran, 51, of Orlando died in October from cuts caused by metal and plastic shrapnel from an exploding airbag in her 2001 Honda Accord .

"An outbreak of bubonic plague has killed 40 people in less than three months, the World Health Organisation said. There have been 119 confirmed cases of the disease reported in Madagascar since late August and experts fear there is a risk of it spreading 'rapidly.' Two per cent of the cases recorded on the Indian Ocean island have been pneumonic plague, 'one of the most deadly infectious diseases,' that can kill within 24 hours. Scroll down for video . Health experts fear that the bubonic plague could spread quickly in the capital city of Antananarivo (pictured) An outbreak of bubonic plague has killed 40 people in less than three months in  Madagascar, the World Health Organisation have said . Health experts now fear the greatest risk could be in the capital, Antananarivo, where high population density and a weaknesses in the health care system could see it quickly spread. To date only two cases of plague and one death have been recorded there. A bubonic plague smear that shows the presence of yersinia pestis (file picture) Plague is a bacterial disease that is mainly spread from one rodent to another by fleas. Humans bitten by an infected flea usually develop a bubonic form of plague, which swells the lymph node and can be treated with antibiotics. If the bacteria reaches the lungs the patient develops pneumonic plague, which is passed from person-to-person through coughing. The first known case of the plague in Madagascar was identified in a man from Soamahatamana on August 31.He died on September 3. The authorities in Madagascar alerted the World Health Organisation at the beginning of November. The organisation said it had not recommend any trade or travel restrictions due to the outbreak. They said the last previously known outbreak of the plague was in Peru in August 2010. A town crier is seen calling for the dead to be bought out in this drawing of London from 1665 . Bubonic plague killed around 100 million people during the 14th century and was known as the 'Black Death.' Drawings and paintings from the outbreak, which wiped out about a third of the European population, depict town criers saying 'bring out your dead' while dragging trailers piled with infected corpses. It is caused by a bacterium known as Yersinia pestis, which uses the flea as a host and is usually transmitted to humans via rats. The disease causes grotesque symptoms such as gangrene and the appearance of large swellings on the groin, armpits or neck, known as 'buboes'. It kills up to two thirds of sufferers within just four days if it is not treated, although if antibiotics are administered within 24 hours of infection patients are highly likely to survive. After the Black Death arrived in 1347 plague became a common phenomenon in Europe, with outbreaks recurring regularly until the 18th century. Bubonic plague has almost completely vanished from the developed world, with 90 per cent of all cases now found in Africa.","40 people have died from the plague in less than three months .

"President Barack Obama signed an executive order today allowing roughly 5 million illegal immigrants to say in the U.S. indefinitely, but it wasn't good enough for at least two advocates of comprehensive reform, who heckled the president this afternoon during a speech over his failure to protect all migrants from deportation. While it was not immediately clear what the young men were shouting at the president during his afternoon remarks at a Las Vegas high school, Obama acknowledged in his response that his actions won't affect all illegal immigrants. 'That's right, not everybody will qualify under this provision. That's the truth,' he said. 'That's why we're still going to have to pass a bill.' 'This is a first step,' he went on to say. 'It's not the only step. We're still gonna have to do more work.' Scroll down for video . Frustrated: President Barack Obama speaks about immigration reform during a visit to Del Sol High School in Las Vegas, Nevada, this afternoon. Obama just halted deportations for 5 million illegal immigrants but comprehensive reform advocates are already demanding he protect more . Heckled: A young man identified as Angel Fernandez interrupted Obama's speech this afternoon to press him to end deportations for additional groups of illegal immigants . Jose Patino of Phoenix, Arizona, stands in the crowd after interrupting Obama's speech this afternoon. The text on Patino's shirt indicates that he may be living in the country illegally . As the the interruption continued, Obama said, 'I've heard you. I've heard you, young man. I've heard you, and I understand. 'But what I'm saying is, this is just a first step. 'I've been respectful to you, I want you to be respectful to me. Alright?' Aside from the disruptions caused midway through his speech by the two young men, who have since been identified as Angel Fernandez and Phoenix, Arizona, resident Jose Patino, the audience also cut off Obama several times to chant his 2008 campaign slogan in Spanish 'si se puede' - 'yes we can' - and to shout that Republicans should 'pass a bill' addressing the broken immigration system. One audience member interrupted the president to thank him for leading the way on immigration. 'You're welcome!' he hollered back at her. Obama promised the roughly 1,600 immigration reform advocates at the rally that he would 'never give up' on comprehensive immigration reform. 'But until that day comes, there are actions that I have the legal authority to take that will help make our immigration system more fair and more just,' he said, noting that he would continue working to make them a 'permanent reform a reality.' 'Nobody was happier than me,' when the Senate passed comprehensive immigration reform, he told them. But it's now been 512 days since that happened, or a year and a half, and the House still hasn't followed suit. 'The only thing that's been standing in the way,' of real reform, he said, 'is a simple yes or no vote in the House of Representatives.' 'If they had allowed a vote on that kind of bill, it would have passed, I would have signed it, it would be law right now,' Obama told the audience. Obama admitted during his speech that it's true that 'not everybody will qualify under this provision' for delayed deportation. 'That's why we're still going to have to pass a bill' President Obama waves as he leaves the stage this afternoon. Obama told supporters today that the executive actions he detailed last night are 'just a first step' and promised to 'never give up' on comprehensive immigration reform . Obama's speech in Nevada today drew a crowd of 1,600 immigration advocates, who at times shouted, 'si se puede' at the president, or 'yes we can' - his 2008 campaign slogan . The president said Republicans who helped write the Senate's bill also deserved credit because they supported comprehensive reform 'even though it wasn't necessarily popular in their part.' 'They knew it was the right thing to do.' Even so, House Speaker John Boehner wouldn't bring their bill to the House floor, Obama lamented. 'And I cajoled, and I called, and I met. I told John Boehner, I'll wash your car, I'll walk your dog, whatever you need to do...just call the bill. 'That's how democracy's supposed to work,' he added. Instead, 'time has been wasted' while 'families have been separated' and 'businesses have been harmed.' 'Las Vegas, I have come back to Del Sol to tell you I'm not giving up,' he continued. 'I will never give up.' The  Del Sol High School event today had special meaning for the president as its the same location from which he authorized his Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program in 2012. He announced last night that he would expand that program to include all DREAMers who were under the age of 16 when they arrived in the U.S. and came to the country before Jan. 1, 2010. Obama also delayed deportations for the parents for American citizen children who have living in the U.S. since before that date. The only stipulations are that they must pay a fine and their back taxes and pass national security and background checks. President Obama embraces Antonia Alvarez as he greets people in the audience after his speech . President  Obama signs two Presidential Memoranda associated with his Executive Actions on immigration in his office on board Air Force One on his way to Nevada . According to the White House, the president also signed two memorandums affiliated with his executive actions during his plane ride  to Nevada. The first directs immigration agencies to 'develop recommendations on how to better improve our visa system so that it more efficiently uses government resources, prevents fraud, and reduces burdens on employers and employees' within 120 days. 'These recommendations will be focused on improving our system which is currently confusing to immigrants, burden to businesses, and negatively impacts workers and families with its long wait times, while protecting American workers,' the White House statement said. The second authorizes the creation of a White House Task Force on New Americans. 'It will bring together various government agencies and support state and local efforts to create a strategy to enhance civic, economic, and linguistic integration of new Americans,' the statement read. Recommendations for the task force are also due in 120 days. Demonstrators protest President Barack Obama's deferred deportation measures outside his event today . At a press conference this morning Boehner chided the president for circumventing the will of Congress and the American people and single-handedly amending the immigration process. 'Our nation’s immigration system is broken, and I think we need to work together to fix it,' Boehner said. 'But fixing it starts with a commitment to working through the democratic process and enforcing the laws that the president is sworn faithfully to execute.' The GOP leader said he repeatedly told the president 'he was making it impossible to build the trust necessary to work together,' and 'the president never listened.' 'And with this action, he has refused to listen to the American people,' Boehner added. 'With this action, the president has chosen to deliberately sabotage any chance of enacting bipartisan reforms that he claims to seek. And, as I told the president yesterday, he’s damaging the presidency itself,' the Ohio Republican told the press. He then vowed that 'the People's House will rise to this challenge' and take Obama on over recent actions. 'We will not stand idle as the president undermines the rule of law in our country and places lives at risk. We’ll listen to the American people, we’ll work with our members, and we will work to protect the Constitution of the United States,' he said.

The sea turtles  undertake lengthy migrations from feeding sites to nesting grounds, normally on sandy beaches. Mating occurs every two to four years and normally takes place in shallow waters close to the shore. To nest, females leave the sea and choose an area, often on the same beach used by their mothers, to lay their eggs. Unlike most sea turtles, adult green turtles are herbivorous, feeding on sea grasses and algae. Juveniles will also eat invertebrates like crabs, jellyfish, and sponges. Males are slightly larger than females and have a longer tail. Both have flippers that resemble paddles, which make them powerful and graceful swimmers. Ms Grillo said: 'Turtles and I are great friends and I love to spend time with them. They are curious because of the reflections in my lens' Green sea turtles migrate long distances between feeding grounds and hatching beaches. Some swim more than 2,600 km to reach their spawning grounds . Photographer Montse Grillo taking a 'selfie' with her friend Sara Garcia (left) and a green turtle.

"Eight siblings and their mother died in an early morning house fire caused by an electrical baseboard heater when temperatures dipped to 1 degree in rural Greenville, Kentucky. The home belonged to 36-year-old Chad Watson, his 35-year-old wife Larae Watson and their nine kids ranging in age from 4-15. Mr Watson and his 11-year-old daughter Kylie escaped the burning building and are being treated for burns and smoke inhalation at Vanderbilt University Medical Center's trauma center in Nashville where both are listed in critical but stable condition. The bodies of mother Larae and children Madison, 15, Kaitlyn, 14, Morgan, 13, Emily, 9, Samuel, 8, Raegan, 6, and 4-year-old twins Mark and Nathaniel were all recovered from the burned-down building.

Up in flames: The house was completely destroyed by this morning . Stable: Chad Watson and daughter Kylie are in critical but stable condition at a hospital in Nashville . Police say that 11 people were inside the house when a neighbor called to report the fire around 2am. The small home had no more than three bedrooms, meaning the family was 'piled-up' in the small living space. By the time firefighters arrived, the home was already 'fully engulfed' in flames. Neighbor Clarence Humphrey told WBKO that she woke up to the sound of sirens and saw flames. 'I knew they weren't getting out. I just froze - went numb really,' Ms Humphrey said. Investigators are looking into what caused the blaze, but said  that it doesn't appear suspicious in nature. Recke said it's still too early to know what caused the fire but that last night's cold temperatures could be to blame. Temperatures went all the way down to 1 degree last night, in a region accustomed to 35 degree weather in January. 'I'm thinking that they probably, maybe had space heaters because of this weather,' Recke told NBC. Neighbor Laura Bennett said it was so cold that when firefighters arrived, the water turned to ice as they started to put out the flames. She says 8-year-old Samuel Watson, who died in the fire, was over the night before to play with her daughter. 'He went home and then 10 hours later he's gone,' she said.

"The first NHS staff left today to join the fight against Ebola at British-built clinics in Sierra Leone. A group of 33 medics - including GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and paramedics - left London's Heathrow Airport and will arrive in the capital of Freetown early tomorrow morning. They are the first wave of NHS volunteers to be deployed by the Government. More than 1,000 NHS staff have volunteered to travel to fight the deadly disease. Scroll down for video . First wave: A group of 33 medics (pictured) - including GPs, nurses, psychiatrists and emergency medicine consultants - left London's Heathrow Airport and will arrive in the capital of Freetown early tomorrow morning . Selfless: Angela Mcbride, Annabel Allcorn and Lizzie Marmont (pictured from left to right) are three of the NHS staff who have volunteered to treat Ebola sufferers at British-built clinics across Sierra Leone . Treatment: The group, some of whom are pictured above, are the first wave of NHS volunteers to be deployed by the Government. More than 1,000 NHS staff have volunteered to travel to fight the deadly disease . The staff will complete a week of training before moving to Ebola treatment centres across the country. There they will start work diagnosing and treating those who have contracted the deadly virus - which has killed more than 5,000 people. Dr Hannah Ryan, 29, from the intensive care unit at Aintree University Hospital, was one of those flying out today. She said: 'I guess there are many reasons I volunteered for this; I am interested in infectious disease medicine, I have always wanted to do humanitarian work, I wanted to take on the challenge of working in this complex environment. 'But mainly I found myself less and less able to hear about the evolving situation in west Africa and the increasing loss of life and do nothing. I felt I just had to go. 'The first aim of this operation is simply to get well-trained staff there to open more treatment centre beds and see more patients, and do it safely. Dedicated: The volunteer staff, including Annabel Allcorn, Angela Mcbride and Lizzie Marmont (above, from left to right) will complete a week of training before moving to Ebola treatment centres across the country . Vital work: The members of NHS staff, pictured today before their flight from Heathrow Airport, will diagnose and treat those who have contracted the deadly virus - which has killed more than 5,000 people . 'I hope more NHS staff, particularly nurses and laboratory staff, will hear about this and be encouraged to volunteer. ' Dr Mark Willcox, 26, a GP from the Wirral, said: 'I am in a position to go and help. I was greatly assisted by the Royal College of Surgeons, Dublin in getting a medical education so it's a privilege to give something back. 'We have received superb training by the UK military, who really should be recognised for their outstanding efforts in this crisis. Response: International Development Secretary Justine Greening said  1,000 British military personnel, scientists, healthcare and aid workers have been deployed to help fight Ebola . 'My GP practice has been hugely supportive of me going which has been fantastic.' Dr James Lavers, 37, an intensive care registrar from Ysbyty Gwynedd in Bangor, said: 'I decided to volunteer for the Ebola response in Sierra Leone because this could be the biggest medical disaster of my lifetime, killing hundreds of thousands of people in the region. 'To prevent this from happening and save vast numbers of lives, large-scale intervention has to happen now.' Dr Roger Alcock, a consultant in emergency and paediatric medicine at Scotland's Forth Valley Royal Hospital, said: 'I have respect for the situation in Sierra Leone but I think with the training we've had we will be able to make a difference. 'My colleagues have been incredibly supportive, both on an individual and an organisational level. I think I have the skills as an emergency physician to help.' Thomas Waters, 26, a paramedic with the West Midlands Ambulance Service, said: 'I feel anxious and nervous but confident in the training that we have had by the military so we can practise safely. 'If we can make a difference to just one life, it will all be worth it. It is important to remember we are the first wave and here to develop a platform for other volunteers to follow on from us.' More teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services. They have been preparing for deployment with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York. Chief Medical Officer Dame Sally Davies said: 'I have been really impressed with the numbers of NHS workers who have stepped forward to help the communities that have been devastated by Ebola. Prepared: NHS staff will undergo a week's intensive training after arriving in Sierra Leone tomorrow. More teams of volunteers are set to leave in the coming weeks after hundreds came forward to offer their services . Committed: Within a week, British volunteers will be treating patients with the deadly Ebola virus in west Africa. They have been preparing with intensive training at a Ministry of Defence facility in York . 'The fact more than 1,000 have come forward so far is a real testament to their commitment to public service. 'I want to offer my thanks to all those that are going, their efforts will make a real difference in West Africa.' A Swiss hospital says a Cuban doctor who contracted Ebola in Sierra Leone is in a stable condition after nearly two days of treatment. Felix Baez Sarria was flown to Geneva and was able to walk off the transport plane in a protective suit and mask after landing late Thursday night. The Geneva University Hospital said Saturday that ""today his health status is stable, although he remains in a serious medical condition."" He is being treated in a special room in an area isolated from the rest of the hospital. Baez, a member of a medical team Cuba sent to Sierra Leone, caught the disease when he rushed to help a patient who was falling over. Professor Tony Redmond, head of the charity UK Med, said: 'The actions of these selfless volunteers in going and the actions of their colleagues and managers to release them and cover for their duties is testimony if ever there was to the altruism that lies at the core of the NHS. I am very proud of them all'. International Development Secretary Justine Greening said Britain's response to the crisis was one of its biggest to a disease outbreak, with almost 1,000 military personnel, scientists, healthcare and aid workers already on the ground. She added: 'But to beat Ebola we desperately need the experience and dedication of skilled doctors and nurses to care for the thousands of sick and dying patients who are not receiving the treatment they need. 'Every one of these NHS heroes will play a vital role in the fight against Ebola. It is only because of their combined efforts that we stand a chance of defeating this disease.' Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: 'I want to thank the brave NHS volunteers who are heading to Sierra Leone today to help in the fight against Ebola. ' They embody the values at the heart of our health service, and their expertise and dedication is second to none.'","More than 1,000 NHS staff have volunteered to travel to fight Ebola .

"An unemployed woman who lived on £58 a week has scooped £26.5million in the EuroMillions lottery. Margaret Loughrey, from Strabane, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, won the massive jackpot in last Tuesday night’s draw. The 48-year-old told her local newspaper, the Strabane Chronicle, that despite winning the big win, she doesn’t intend to move away from her hometown. Lottery winner: Margaret Loughrey, from Strabane, County Tyrone, Northern Ireland, who scooped a £26.5million prize on the EuroMillions with a lucky dip ticket . She said: ‘Definitely not. It won’t change who I am. Strabane will always be home for me.’ Ms Loughrey told how she bought the Lucky Dip on Tuesday after applying for another role at her local job centre. ‘I left the house on Tuesday because I heard there was a job advertised and I wanted to apply for it. So I went to the Jobcentre and printed out the job application before going to the Supervalu shop. ‘I can’t always afford to do the EuroMillions, but I had a couple of extra pound in my purse and just on the spur of the moment, I did a Lucky Dip.’ Miss Loughrey recalled the moment on Wednesday morning when she found out she had won the money. Winning ticket: Margaret Loughrey, 48, bought the lucky dip ticket from this SuperValu grocery store near her home in Strabane . Modest home: Margaret Loughrey's small property in Strabane, County Tyrone which she has pledged not to move out of . ‘I must have checked 10 times. I took a walk out to the back garden and sat out there for a while before coming back in and checking again. ‘I must have walked around the house for five hours before ringing my brother and asking him to call up. ‘I never panicked. I’m level-headed and I know I’ll think it all through and do the right thing, see to the right people.’ She insisted the money would not change her life but said her family will benefit from the windfall including her four brothers, sister and 75-year-old mother, Elizabeth, extended family and a few close friends. Last night, her brother Paul told the Irish Daily Mail his sister was ‘beside herself’ with the win. Shop assistant, Nadine O'Kane, handed her the slip with the numbers 19, 23, 27, 42 and 44 with Lucky Stars 3 and 5. Miss O'Kane told the Irish Daily Mail: ‘Its nice to see it happen to her. I didn’t know her. I only found out on Sunday after I was told to come into work to get my picture taken.’ Local SuperValu store manager Colm Gallagher said: ‘I don’t know what Margaret’s going to do with the money but I wish her all the best with it.'","Margaret Loughrey, 48, bought the ticket on 'the spur of the moment'

"David Cameron and his wife Samantha ‘take turns’ with household tasks - with the Prime Minister in charge of making his children's tea tonight. Mr Cameron revealed that the couple, who have three children, mainly tackle the chores in their Oxfordshire constituency home. He admitted the family home is equipped with numerous appliances, as Nancy, Elwen and Florence make ‘quite a lot of mess to clear up’. David Cameron, holding a vacuum at the Dyson factory today, has insisted that he shares the chores with his wife Samantha . The PM made the comments during a tour of the Dyson factory in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, after the company pledged to spend £1 billion on research and development. Mr Cameron was asked by reporters whether he or his wife was responsible for the vacuuming in their household. ‘It's a bit of a task, we take these things in turn,’ Mr Cameron replied. ‘When we are in the constituency that's where we tend to do that.' The Prime Minister added: 'Tonight I have to make the children's tea so you'd better get on and ask me some questions.’ Mr Cameron was also asked whether he owned any Dyson products but would not specify whether he did or not. He said: 'There's a range of appliances.' ‘I won't go into all of the details but there's a lot of appliances because when you've got three children there's quite a lot of mess to clear up.’ Mr Cameron said he takes it in turns with his wife to do the household chores and revealed that tonight he had to make the children's tea . During the visit, Mr Cameron was shown new Dyson products by Sir James Dyson in his office, including a robot vacuum cleaner. He viewed prototypes of products created by 3D printing and then met engineers in a research laboratory at the factory.","PM and his wife have three children who makes 'quite a lot of mess'

"Hope Solo's husband was driving a US women's soccer team van when he was arrested on suspicion of DUI, reports claim. Solo, 33, was in the car when former Seattle Seahawks tight end Jerramy Stevens, 36, was pulled over in Manhattan Beach, California, at about 1.30am on Monday for driving without headlights. Solo has since been suspended from the national squad for 30 days, forcing her to miss matches next month in Europe. Although U.S. Soccer did not specify the reason for the suspension announced last night, TMZ understands it was connected to the fact that Stevens was driving a team van. Scroll down for video . Hope Solo has been suspended from the U.S. women's national team for 30 days. Solo pictured in a Washington state court in November with husband Jerramy Stevens . The reason for the suspension, announced on Wednesday night, was not specified but comes after an incident at training camp . The goalkeeper was reportedly almost arrested for disorderly conduct after she became 'belligerent' while officers conducted the traffic stop. She was in Southern California for training camp with the U.S. national team, which is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June. Coach Jill Ellis said in a statement: 'During our current national team camp, Hope made a poor decision that has resulted in a negative impact on U.S. Soccer and her teammates,' 'We feel at this time it is best for her to step away from the team.' The goalkeeper has been dismissed from training camp in Southern California, where the team is preparing to play in the World Cup starting in June . Hope Solo was in the car when her husband Jerramy Stevens, pictured together in 2013, was arrested for drunk driving . Solo, who has won two Olympic gold medals with the U.S. team, was released from camp. In a statement, she told the Associated Press: 'I accept and respect the Federation's decision, and more importantly, I apologize for disappointing my teammates, coaches and the Federation who have always supported me. 'I think it's best for me to take a break, decompress from the stress of the last several months, and come back mentally and physically ready to positively contribute to the team.' Jerramy Stevens, a former Seattle Seahawks tight end, was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence in Manhattan Beach, California . Domestic violence charges against Solo were dismissed after she was arrested for assaulting her nephew and her sister during an allegedly drunken brawl. The charges stemmed from an altercation with her half-sister and 17-year-old nephew at a party in Washington last June. Solo had pleaded not guilty in that case, and she continued to play for the U.S. team and with her National Women's Soccer League team, the Seattle Reign, while awaiting trial. Her last appearance with the national team was in December, when she started in a scoreless draw against Brazil in the championship game of the 2014 International Tournament of Brasilia. Last September, in an exhibition victory over Mexico, Solo logged her 72nd shutout, passing Briana Scurry (1994-2008) on national team's career list. The suspension comes at a critical time for the U.S. team. Following the exhibition matches in February, the team will play in the Algarve Cup in March. The team will open World Cup play on June 8 against Australia in Winnipeg, Manitoba. An expanded field of 24 teams will compete in the World Cup, which will be played in six Canadian cities. The United States is in Group D, which also includes Sweden and Nigeria. The U.S. women, currently ranked No. 2 in the world behind Germany, are seeking their third World Cup title but first since 1991. Solo will be eligible for reinstatement after the suspension, pending review and approval by U.S. Soccer and Ellis, U.S. Soccer said.","Hope Solo and Jerramy Stevens 'drove team van on Monday at 1.30am'

"Coca-Cola has been dropped from the Brand of the Year shortlist at a gay magazine's award ceremony because of its sponsorship of the Sochi Winter Olympics. The company had been listed alongside the likes of YouTube, Google and British Airways for the Out in the City and G3 award, which is given for promoting diversity and equality. However its involvement in the Winter Olympics, which are being held in Russia which passed a law banning homosexual 'propaganda' last year, has lead to it being dropped. Coca Cola has been embarrassed by a web glitch which means users of one of its websites are banned from writing Gay or Gays on the side of a virtual can . The message is usually displayed when visitors attempt to type a swear word. The names 'Straight' and 'Hetero' are both accepted . Sarah Garrett, managing director of the company which produce the awards, said: 'It is bitterly disappointing that Coca-Cola has not listened to the collective voice of the global gay community who are horrified by the Putin government's anti-gay and repressive policies. 'Brands like Coke should be making a stand against the demonisation of gay people by withdrawing sponsorship for the Winter Olympics. Refusing to do so is a slap in the face to the international gay community.' Earlier today the company was embarrassed after it emerged . visitors to one of its website have been banned from writing 'Gay' or . 'Gays' on a virtual can. Users of the page are instead given the message 'Oops. Let's pretend you didn't just type that. Please try another name' which . is usually displayed when a swear word is entered. The . company has also been accused of downplaying its sponsorship of the . Sochi Winter Olympics in the West, to avoid upsetting gay rights activists. While there has been little or no . advertising from Coca Cola in the US, Russia has been . covered with the company's distinctive white and red logo, which . features on flags, lampposts and even security officers' uniforms. Images have also been circulating online . of an Olympic security guard tackling a gay rights protester while . wearing a uniform which features the Coca Cola logo.

'Oops' message is usually only displayed if the user tries to type a . swear word, but also applies to the words 'Gay' and 'Gays' on the South . African page. The names 'Straight' and 'Hetero' are both deemed to be acceptable. Gay . rights protestors, including Queer Nation New York, have slated Coca . Cola for backing the games, saying that gay Russians face 'brutal . violence, complete oppression of the basic human right to speech, . assembly and expression' adding that 'Coke cares only about their Sochi . profits.' In September, International Olympic Commission marketing chairman Gerhard Heiberg admitted that sponsors feared a backlash against sponsoring the games. Speaking to CNN, he said: 'I have heard a lot from the sponsors, especially the American sponsors, of what they are afraid of might happen. I think this could ruin a lot for all of us.' The criticism of Coca Cola and other brands, such as McDonald's and Visa, for sponsoring the event comes after Russia passed a law banning gay 'propaganda' last year, leading to calls for a boycott. While Coca Cola has not advertised the fact it is sponsoring the Olympics in Western countries, Russians have been photographed holding branded flags which again feature the distinctive hexagon design . Here residents of Rostov-on-Don wave branded flags, standing between Coca Cola signs and a truck . Vladimir Putin has said the law poses no threat to foreign visitors during the games, and has defended himself against allegation that he is prejudiced by saying he has gay friends and admires Elton John . Today Sochi's mayor Anatoly Pakhomov, who . is a member of president Vladimir Putin’s United Russia party, said . there were no gays in his town, and that homosexuality was 'not accepted . here in the Caucasus'. The comments follow on from a bizarre interview in which president Vladimir Putin claimed he was 'not prejudiced in any way', despite saying that the anti-gay legislation was necessary to 'clean up' Russia and drive up . the country's birth rate, which he believes has been hampered by the gay . population. Speaking to the Andrew Marr show, Mr Putin said that visitors to Russia had nothing to fear from the anti-gay law, adding that he had gay friends himself and was a huge admirer of Elton John's 'professional achievements', despite his sexuality. At the time of publishing Coca Cola US was unavailable for comment, thought a spokesman for Coca Cola UK confirmed there was no campaign featuring the Olympics planned for Britain.

"In the 1950s Norwegians were left stunned by a series of seemingly inexplicable UFO sightings. Throughout the decade numerous lights in the sky were reported by members of the public and pilots alike, with some suggesting they were of extraterrestrial origin. But now the mystery has apparently been solved, as the CIA has revealed it wasn’t ET at all - rather, it was the agency flying their secretive U-2 aircraft high in the atmosphere. In a tweet earlier this week the CIA claimed responsibility for numerous UFO sightings over Norway in the 1950s. At the time the agency carried out a study of over 1,200 UFO sightings and found over half of them could be attributed to their secretive U-2 aircraft, which began flying in secret from 1955 at over 60,000 feet . In a tweet the CIA said: ‘Remember reports of unusual activity in the skies in the ‘50s? That was us.’ The revelation originally came about through something known as Operation Blue Book in 1969. Nicknamed ‘Dragon Lady’, the Lockheed U-2 is an ultra-high altitude reconnaissance aircraft operated by the United States Air Force (USAF). The first flight of one of the single-engine planes was on 1 August 1955, with regular flights beginning in 1957. It has an operational ceiling of 70,000 feet (21,000 metres), making it well-suited for spying missions. It was used extensively throughout the Cold War, flying over the Soviet Union, Cuba and other countries. They did not go completely undetected, however. One infamous incident occurred on 1 May 1960 when pilot Gary Powers was shot down during a reconnassiance flight over the Soviet Union. The event marked a deterioration in relations between the two superpowers. Powers was held prisoner until 10 February 1962, when he was released as part of a prisoners exchange with Soviet officer Rudolf Abel. This was a systematic study of various UFO reports that sought to discover if the sightings were a threat to national security. In the end the project determined that, of the 12,618 UFO reports collected, almost all of them could be attributed to misidentification of natural phenomena such as clouds, or conventional aircraft. A number of reports, however, were revealed to be high-altitude reconnaissance aircraft such as the U-2 and A-12. The secretive planes were able to fly above 60,000 feet (18,000 metres) but, as they were kept under wraps, pilots at the time didn’t think anything man-made was flying that high. So when they spotted sunlight glinting off planes much higher than they were flying, they occasionally thought that what they were seeing was out of this world. ‘High-altitude testing of the U-2 soon led to an unexpected side effect - a tremendous increase in reports of unidentified flying objects (UFO’s),’ the CIA says in their book ‘The CIA and the U-2 Program’. ‘In the mid-1950s, most commercial airliners flew at altitudes between 10,000 and 20,000 feet [3,000 and 6,000 metres] and military aircraft like the B-47s and B-57s operated at altitudes below 40,000 feet. ‘Consequently once U-2s started flying at altitudes above 60,000 feet [18,000 metres], air-traffic controllers began receiving increasing numbers of UFO reports.’ The CIA reports how these sightings in turn led to Operation Blue Book, which ultimately found that one-half of all UFO reports in the late 1950s and most of the 1960s were caused by UFOs. But, at the time, they could not reveal this to the public. The CIA has said that numerous UFO sightings in the 1950s and 1960s can be attributed to flights of its U-2 aircraft (Lockheed TR-1 pictured). The plane was flown in secret, unbeknown to regular pilots at the time, so when they saw sunlight glint off its wings much higher than them they would often report the sighting as a UFO . When the CIA investigated numerous UFO sightings in the 1950s and 60s they found most could be attributed to natural phenomena or manmade objects.  This pictured from 16 May 1966 in Hillsdale, Michigan, USA shows a UFO that the Air Force later claimed was 'swamp gas' One UFO expert, however, is not convinced by the CIA's claims. 'It is ironic that the CIA is now keen to declare that many high altitude UFO sightings were caused by their secret U2 aircraft missions,' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, tells MailOnline. 'As early as 1962 a US engineer called Leon Davidson warned ufologists that the CIA was feeding them with false information to sustain the idea that UFOs were interplanetary vehicles.' 'In July 1952 there was a wave of UFO sightings over Washington DC that hit the newspaper headlines and led the CIA to convene a panel of experts to review the subject. 'This was headed by Dr. Howard P. Robertson and after four days they concluded that most sightings were caused by misidentification and a mild form of mass-hysteria. 'Regarding the latest ""revelation"" that the U2 aircraft caused a majority of UFO sightings is nothing new, and some have noted that it is significant that they should bring this to light on World UFO Day on 2 July. 'It is also noteworthy that they mention the U2 caused UFO sightings over Norway in the late 1950s, yet this does not explain a multitude of sightings over Norway and Denmark during the Nato ‘Operation Mainbrace’ exercises in 1952 before the U2 was built.' In their study of UFO sightings the CIA also found that many of the reports could be attributed to saucer-shaped clouds such as a lenticular cloud, seen here. UFO expert Nigel Watson, however, isn't convinced by their claims, and finds it 'ironic' that they would make the 'revelation' on World UFO Day .","The CIA has claimed responsibility for various UFO sightings in the 1950s .

"By . Jane Flanagan In Cape Town . Updated: . 04:10 EST, 14 November 2011 . Accused: Peter Roebuck arriving at court for his trial in 2001. The former Somerset captain plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match . A cricketer turned commentator leapt to his death from a hotel window as police questioned him about sexual assault allegations. Former Somerset captain Peter Roebuck, 55, plunged six floors in the apparent suicide in Cape Town, where he had been commentating on a Test match. According to sources, he became agitated when a detective and a uniformed officer from the South African police sexual crimes unit arrived to interview him at the Southern Sun hotel in the suburb of Claremont. Mr Roebuck phoned fellow cricket journalist Jim Maxwell to help find him a lawyer and contact a group of underprivileged boys he had been supporting near his South African home. ‘Can you come down to my room quickly, I’ve got a problem,’ he said in the desperate phone call just after 9pm on Saturday. Minutes later, with the uniformed officer still in the room, Mr Roebuck plunged 70ft to his death, hitting an awning as he fell. Paramedics were called to the hotel, a short walk from the Newlands cricket ground, and Mr Roebuck was pronounced dead at the scene. Police seized items from his hotel room, including a laptop computer. Mr Roebuck had spent part of his last day alive with members of the Australian cricket team, who had lost their first Test against South Africa at Newlands on Friday. He regularly toured with the team as a distinguished writer and broadcaster for the Australian media, following a career in county cricket during which he played 335 first-class matches. He was named as a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1988. Old enemies: Ian Botham, left, and Roebuck, right, in 1987. When Roebuck backed a Somerset club committee decision not to renew the contracts of  West Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for Roebuck . A distraught Mr Maxwell, one of the last people to see Mr Roebuck alive on Saturday night, gave a statement to police yesterday. The Australian Broadcasting . Corporation cricket commentator, well known to British audiences for his . work on Test Match Special, said he had seen nothing to suggest Mr . Roebuck was contemplating suicide. ‘Things happen. As far as I could see . at the Test, there wasn’t a problem,’ said Mr Maxwell. ‘He was a person . who had a great sense of humanity and caring. That was Peter. ‘There were a lot of other things . about him, but we’ve lost a wonderful friend and supporter.’ He . described Mr Roebuck as ‘one of the outstanding writers on the game of . cricket’. After retiring from cricket in 1991, Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket . Police spokesman Captain Frederick . Van Wyk confirmed Mr Roebuck’s death was being treated as suicide, but . would not give details about the sexual assault allegations. In his long playing record, one . incident stood out – a spectacular clash with Sir Ian Botham when he . replaced him as Somerset captain in 1985. When Cambridge-educated Mr Roebuck . backed a club committee decision not to renew the contracts of  West . Indies stars Viv Richards and Joel Garner, their close friend Botham was . furious and walked out on the side, sparking a long-standing enmity for . Mr Roebuck. After retiring from cricket in 1991, . Mr Roebuck turned his hand to writing and broadcasting, and become one . of the most respected and widely read commentators in cricket. He divided his time between homes in . Bondi Beach, Australia, and the South African town of Pietermaritzburg, . where he was helping a group of underprivileged boys through school and . university. Mr Roebuck, who was unmarried, was at . the centre of controversy in 2001 when he received a suspended jail . sentence for common assault after beating three teenage cricketers . across their bare buttocks with a cane. The South African boys had been invited to stay at his former home in Taunton, Somerset, for coaching in the late 1990s. Henk Lindeque, one of Mr Roebuck’s victims, said yesterday he was ‘shocked’ to learn of the cricket writer’s sudden death. ‘I haven’t had any contact with him . since the trial,’ Mr Lindeque said. ‘The problem was not so much that he . caned us but wanted to examine the marks. That’s when I decided to get . out of his house.’ Mr Roebuck, one of six children born . in Oxford to teacher parents, was apparently estranged from his family . for much of his adult life. On his website, he included . contributions from his ‘extended family’ of underprivileged boys from . South Africa and Zimbabwe – some of them cricketers – whom he assisted . with school fees, coaching or getting jobs. Peter Roebuck has jumped to his death in Cape Town, leaving behind the last great mystery of a complex and often tortured life that was full of questions and very few answers. The former Somerset captain committed suicide in South Africa, one of the two countries where he had homes after leaving England to embark on a media career mainly in Australia. He had been covering  Australia’s Test defeat by South Africa at Newlands. Western Province police spokesman Frederick van Wyk confirmed that ‘a cricket commentator committed  suicide by jumping from the sixth floor of his Claremont hotel on Saturday night. He died on impact.’ Roebuck forged a successful career as a writer after his playing days . Part of the team: Roebuck (third left on the back row) played for Somerset during the 1980s with Sir Ian Botham and Sir Viv Richards . Van Wyk refused to comment on reports police had spoken to Roebuck earlier on Saturday but said they ‘will investigate all the circumstances around his death’. It brings a tragic end to the life of a solitary man whose achievements as a competent if unspectacular batsman were followed by a career on radio and in print where Roebuck, 55, emerged as one of the game’s most original and sometimes brilliant thinkers. ‘In orthodox spheres Peter might be . regarded as odd, whereas he is merely obscure and oblique. He is an . unconventional loner, with an independent outlook on life, an irreverent . sense of humour and often a withering tongue’ His life often appeared a long, lonely and ultimately futile attempt to find fulfilment, with plenty of controversy along the way, notably his suspended jail sentence 10 years ago after he admitted caning three young  cricketers he had offered to coach. It was that unedifying court case in Taunton that led many to  question Roebuck’s motives when he helped fund the education of promising young cricketers, often providing accommodation for them at his homes in Sydney and Pietermaritzburg. Yet there was no doubting the warmth of the tributes that Roebuck’s death inspired on Sunday. Both Cricket Australia and Cricket South Africa highlighted the good work Roebuck had done for the game and his passion for it, being a particularly articulate critic of the dark forces that brought  corruption to the sport. I worked briefly with  Roebuck 12 years ago at the Sunday Telegraph and I have to say I found him the rudest, most prickly and unhelpful colleague I have ever experienced. This was a man who refused to cover the ‘dirt in the pocket’ incident involving Mike Atherton for the Sunday Times, saying it was not a story, and once told his despairing sports editor ‘I tend not to talk to people’ when asked to do an interview. Facts rarely featured in his work. But I never got to know him properly and those who did spoke very differently on Sunday. ‘Scatty and focused, brilliant and fallible, muscular yet incredibly fragile, Peter Roebuck was too many men rolled into an irreplaceable one,’ wrote his friend Peter English in a brilliant tribute on the website Cricinfo, to which Roebuck contributed. ‘Individuals like him often sit on the outside, making choices and then fretting over the consequences. ‘In the end it was a wonder he lasted so long, dealing with demons and demonising which shadowed him during his playing days and forever after. Deep down, I think, he knew he would determine his end.’ The fact that the cricket career of a man good enough to captain England in an unofficial one-day match against Holland will be remembered more for the conflict he inspired by backing the move to force Viv Richards and Joel Garner out of Somerset says everything about the enigma that Peter Roebuck was. The rift that resulted with Ian Botham, who pinned the word ‘Judas’ to Roebuck’s peg in the Somerset changing room and left the county after backing his illustrious  colleagues, was never mended. Roebuck was later to write in his autobiography, the aptly titled Sometimes I forgot to laugh, that ‘the cost was enormous’. It was in Roebuck’s first book, a diary of a county season called It Never Rains, where he revealed himself to be a writer of rare talent and it was as a commentator that he was to distinguish himself far more than in a cricket career that was to bring him in excess of 17,000 first-class runs. It was with Australia’s media that he made his name, mainly working for ABC Radio and the Sydney Morning Herald, after he had developed a peculiarly acrimonious relationship with England and all things English, often disparagingly referring to his countrymen in a faux Australian accent as ‘those Poms’. Nationality was something that clearly troubled Roebuck but it was far from the most serious of his troubles, as the circumstances around his demise so tragically demonstrated. Perhaps the last word should go to his father, an Oxford schoolteacher, who wrote in his son’s autobiography: ‘In orthodox spheres Peter might be regarded as odd, whereas he is merely obscure and oblique. He is an unconventional loner, with an independent outlook on life, an irreverent sense of humour and often a withering tongue.’ Better to remember those words than what drove Roebuck to take his own life.","‘Can you come down to my room quickly, I’ve got a problem,’ he said in phone call minutes before death .

"A mystery EPA employee in Denver seems more intent on spreading toxic waste than cleaning it up. The agency has received more than a dozen reports of 'beyond gross' behavior in its Denver office - including a woman who has been smearing menstrual blood and human feces on the walls. Other reports include 'a trail of [human waste] leading out in the hallway' near the men's bathroom, an employee who urinated on the toilet seat and floor of the bathroom, and another employee who defecated outside the building when he was locked out. In June, a memo from Deputy Regional Administrator Howard Cantor was released publicly that revealed the Denver office of the EPA was beset by an employee who was clogging toilets and putting human waste on the floor outside the bathroom. Toxic waste dump: The EPA's Denver office has been beset by a mystery employee who is smearing human waste and menstrual blood on the walls . A new report from environmental policy newsletter Greenwire reveals that bathroom problems were even more prevalent than previously thought. And while the incidents appear to have stopped, the perpetrator was never caught. Now, the Environmental Protection Agency is calling in the Department of Homeland Security to protect employees from the contamination in the office. In emails obtained by Greenwire, employees report being 'terrified' by the perpetrator and fear she could become violent. Homeland Security's Federal Protective Service, which provides security for federal offices, has stepped up patrols. The EPA has also brought in a workplace violence consultant and increased its own security at the office. Newly-released emails from EPA employees reveal a slew of disguising behavior at the office. An employee sent a picture of this clogged toilet to EPA bosses . 'A male supervisor ... told her that management knows that it is a female on the [redacted] floor who has been wiping feces and menstrual blood on the walls (I'm really sorry, this is beyond gross) and that they are worried that her behavior is escalating,' according to one email obtained by Greenwire. Another email reported: 'The incidents of urine on the seats and the floors are still occurring regularly in the women's restrooms; however they are no longer limited to the 6th and 7th floors. Employees are now reporting incidents more frequently.' Another employee sent a picture of an overflowing toilet to bosses. In another email, an employee told bosses: 'I can think of two people right off the bat that should be checked out. .. one who under the context of emergency, defecated outside the building when precluded from coming into the building prior to 5:30am.' The incidents have led some employees to fear the perpetrator could become violent and even commit a workplace shooting. Employees have reported one coworker who was found with ammunition. Another was reported to printed off specifications for a rifle in the office.","The federal employee responsible for the 'beyond gross' behavior has not been caught .

"Smirking: Boden Hughes, 26, had been drinking on board the vessel when he set a pile of clothes alight . A PASSENGER who sparked  an £800,000 blaze while smoking  cannabis on board a ferry has been jailed for 11 years. Boden Hughes – who had been drinking heavily – risked the lives of almost 1,000 people when he started a fire in cabin 568 on the King Seaways DFDS ferry on December 28. Some 27 passengers and crew needed treatment for smoke inhalation as flames quickly spread out into the ship’s corridor. Six people, including a pregnant woman, had to be winched from the vessel by helicopter, Newcastle Crown Court heard. The fire, which started when the ship was 25 miles out to sea during darkness, caused panic to spread through the boat, with  children standing on deck in tears. Amid the confusion, Hughes then got involved in a fight with a passenger. The vessel, which was bound for Amsterdam, was forced to return to its departure point in North Shields, North Tyneside. The 946 passengers on board faced having their trips cancelled. Hughes, 27, of Sunderland, admitted reckless arson on the basis he started the fire accidentally when his lighter set ablaze some clothes on his bed. Judge James Goss, QC, sentenced him to nine years for arson and affray, which he admitted, as well as two years for his involvement in a copper cable theft conspiracy, to which he also pleaded guilty. The judge said the last example of fire on board a similar vessel resulted in the death of 159 people, who perished on the Scandinavia Star in 1990. The judge said he agreed with  the prosecution’s description of Hughes’s ‘spectacular recklessness’ in using a naked flame to try to smoke cannabis. ‘The consequences could have been disastrous,’ the judge said. ‘Panic was caused, passengers were injured by reason of smoke inhalation and an £800,000 loss caused to the ferry operator.’ He added: ‘Fires on a ship are even more serious than those on land. The escape routes are limited, the stability of the vessel can be affected by use of water to extinguish the flames. This is an offence of the highest culpability.’ The court heard Hughes had boarded the ferry with his girlfriend and another couple. After drinking in the ship’s bars he had to be helped back to his cabin by a member of the crew. Fire: The DFDS ferry (file picture) was diverted back to the North Shields terminal after the blaze broke out . Disruption: Passengers disembarking the ferry, which was diverted back to the terminal in December 2013 . Costly: The judge said £800,000 in losses were caused to the ferry operator DFDS by the incident . Within minutes a smoke alarm went off . and staff who went to investigate were met with a smoke-filled corridor. Hughes was crawling out of his cabin when the crew arrived. Prosecutor . Ian Lowrie, QC, told the court: ‘He was on all fours, half naked, going . into the direction of the corridor.’ As the crew tried to fight the . flames – which were eventually extinguished by the ship’s sprinklers – . an evacuation was put into operation. Mr Lowrie added: ‘Most of the passengers assembled on the upper decks. They were very scared, children were crying. ‘The crew noted people and  passengers beginning to exhibit  signs of panic.’ The court heard that while crew concentrated on the safety of the passengers, Hughes could still not be calmed. Mr Lowrie said when he got to the deck he met a passenger and got into a fight. The . court heard any fire on board a ship creates a ‘race against time’ because any water used on the flames makes the vessel unstable. The . £800,000 cost of the blaze comprised £80,000 worth of repairs, a . £30,000 fee because the ship was forced to change course, £25,000 for . medical evacuations, £475,000 on passenger refunds, £175,000 loss of . revenue and £25,000 legal and other costs, the court was told. Christopher Morrison, defending, said Hughes was ‘extremely sorry to all concerned’, especially those who had to be airlifted. He . added: ‘He wants to say sorry to the company, to the passengers whose . enjoyment was ruined and to all passengers and crew concerned in the . obvious panic.’","Boden Hughes had been drinking heavily when he set pile of clothes alight .

"Louise Troh, 54, was confined when she learned her fiance Thomas Eric Duncan had died of Ebola on October 8th and has now landed herself a book deal . The fiancée of the Liberian man who died of Ebola in Dallas last month has landed a book deal to write her memoir for a publishing company affiliated with movie mogul Harvey Weinstein. Louise Troh, 54, will have a book planned for release in April by Weinstein Books about her relationship with Thomas Eric Duncan, who flew from Liberia to Dallas in September to marry her. Duncan became ill shortly after arriving and died on October 8th. He is the only person to have died from Ebola in the United States. His family said it had reached a settlement with the Dallas hospital that treated Duncan and admitted to making mistakes in his care. Troh was not included in the settlement. 'It was supposed to be the first happy day of a new life of joy for us all. But before we could make our new family, he died a terrible death in a quarantined room,' Troh said in a statement. 'I am writing this book to tell people about Eric, about our love story, about our family and about my faith that has been tested but not broken,' she said. Troh, her 13-year-old son and two others were placed in 21-day quarantine after Duncan tested positive the virus. She lost almost all her possessions when her apartment was decontaminated and has been living in a residence provided by the Dallas Catholic Dioceses. Although Troh has been declared healthy, she had been unable to find a place to live because of the stigma related to her exposure to Ebola, her family said however she is now is settling into a Dallas condominium . Louise Troh said Friday she is 'relieved' to be able to leave her daughter's cramped, two-bedroom apartment for her own home. 'Thanks be to God I found a place to lay my head,' she said. Scroll down for video . 'Patient zero': Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola in Texas and became the first person to die of the disease in the U.S. The condo was purchased by three families who attend Wilshire Baptist Church with Troh, according to the church's pastor, George Mason. Troh will pay them rent. The three-bedroom unit is located in Vickery Meadows, the densely populated immigrant neighborhood near downtown Dallas where Troh and three others lived before being evacuated after Duncan became the first person diagnosed with Ebola in the United States. Except for a few bins of photographs and personal items, everything in Troh's former apartment was taken away and burned because of possible contamination. Duncan stayed with Troh for 10 days before his first trip to the emergency room. Troh's new home has been furnished by the nonprofit Dwell with Dignity, Mason said.","Louise Troh will have book set for release in April about her relationship .

"Some of the tallest and most recognisable skyscrapers across the world have been slammed as 'vain' for having a large amount of useless space. For a skyscraper to be labelled with the prestigious supertall tag, it needs to be over 985ft in height, but the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH) has discovered many of these luxury buildings in places such as Dubai and China use unused space on top of their designs to bolster their height. It has highlighted the ten 'vainest' skyscrapers, and discovered that in Dubai alone, 19 per cent of space at the top of the cities' skyscrapers is going unused. For a skyscraper to be labelled supertall, it needs to be over 985ft. Some of the world's tallest buildings bolster their height by using unused space and the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat's (CTBUH) calls this Vanity Height. The top ten 'vainest' buildings are pictured with Dubai's Burj Al Arab topping the list . Five of the top ten 'vainest' skyscrapers were found across Dubai's skyline, pictured, with 19 per cent of space at the top of the cities' skyscrapers going unused . For a skyscraper to be labelled with the . prestigious supertall tag, it needs to be over 985ft tall according to the Council on Tall Building and Urban Habitat's (CTBUH) Height Criteria. Any space at the top of the building that can't be lived in or used for other purposes is classed as useless space. This is classed as a building's Vanity Height because if it was removed, the skyscraper would no longer qualify as supertall. By mid 2011 there were 54 buildings that were taller than CTBUH's 980ft cut off. There are now 72 supertall building occupied worldwide. CTBUH said that 61 percent of the world’s tallest . buildings -  44 out of 72 - would not be classed as supertall if the . unused space was removed. The CTBUH said in the report: 'We noticed in Kingdom Tower in Jeddah, that a fair amount of the top of the building seemed to be an unoccupied spire.' 'This prompted us to investigate the increasing trend towards extreme spires and other extensions of tall buildings that do not enclose usable space, and create a new term to describe this - Vanity Height.' The council - which officially determines the height of a building using its Height Criteria - go on to explain that Vanity Height is classed as the distance between a skyscraper’s highest living space, and what is considered its architectural top. It lists the 10 worst offenders, with unused space ranging from 27 per cent up to 39 per cent, with five of them in Dubai. The skyscraper with the greatest Vanity Height was found to be the iconic Burj Al Arab in Dubai. It is architecturally 1,055 feet tall, yet the top 405 feet is 'useless' and without this unused space, the skyscraper wouldn't qualify as supertall. The skyscraper with the greatest Vanity Height was found to be the iconic Burj Al Arab in Dubai. It is architecturally 1,055 feet tall, yet the top 405 feet is 'useless' and without this unused space, the skyscraper wouldn't qualify as supertall according to the CTBUH . The ratio of the living space in this luxury hotel, compared to the useless space, is 39 per cent. The second vainest building is the Bank of America Tower in New York, which has 36 per cent unused space. This equates to 429 feet of its 1,200 feet height, and again would lose its status if this top was removed. The world's tallest building, Dubai's Burj Khalifa, also made the list with 29 per cent unused space, which consists of 800 feet of its 2,716 feet height. Three of the top ten are in China, including the Zifeng Tower (30 per cent), the Minsheng Bank (28 per cent) and The Pinnacle (27 per cent). CTBUH claim that the trend of these so-called vain skyscrapers was started by New York's Chrysler building, which was built in 1930. The trend for Vanity Height is thought to have been started in New York, pictured. The Chrysler building was one of the earliest examples. The New York Times Tower made CTBUH's top ten list with 31 per cent unused space . CTBUH used charts to examine the rising trend for Vanity Height, pictured, in countries including China and Dubai. They claim the trend started with New York's Chrysler building in 1930. By mid-2011 there were 54 supertall buildings and there are now 72 . However, it didn't become common place until China and the United Arab Emirates began building their supertall skyscrapers with spires and similar extensions. By mid 2011 there were 54 buildings that were taller than CTBUH's 980ft cut off. There are now 72 supertall buildings occupied worldwide. Elsewhere, the New York Times Tower and the Emirates Tower in Dubai have 31 per cent unused space. None of the skyscrapers listed in CTBUH's top ten are outside of Dubai, China or New York. According to CTBUH, 61 percent of the world’s tallest buildings -  44 out of 72 - would not be classed as supertall if the unused space was removed. The CTBUH also claims that if a building's unused space is more than half its total height then it is technically classed as a 'non-building'.","Company created report showing the 10 'vainest' skyscrapers in the world .

"Labour yesterday completed its U-turn on Universal Credit by offering to back it. Liam Byrne, the party’s work and pensions spokesman, said the welfare scheme was a ‘good idea in principle’ and that he hoped it would be retained in Labour’s next manifesto. But he said the implementation of Universal Credit had been a ‘disaster’ and that he had written to Iain Duncan Smith asking for cross-party talks on how to fix the problems with it. Liam Byrne (left), Labour's work and pensions spokesman, said Universal Credit was a 'good idea in principle' but has written to Iain Duncan Smith (right) for cross-party talks on how to fix problems with it . The Labour Party voted against the scheme, which is intended to make sure work always pays, in Parliament last year. But since then some Labour figures have weakened their opposition to it. Universal Credit is intended to roll six benefits including jobseeker’s allowance, working tax credits and housing benefit into one monthly payment. Trials of the scheme are taking place but the national launch has been delayed. During a speech to the mentoring charity Chance UK in north London yesterday, Mr Byrne made a personal attack on the Work and Pensions Secretary, saying there ‘seems to be something very wrong in the mind’ of Mr Duncan Smith. But he later said Mr Duncan Smith was a ‘good man’ and that he wanted them to work together to iron out problems with Universal Credit because the system as currently operated would leave ‘thousands’ of people better off on benefits. The Labour Party voted against Universal Credit, which aims to get people back to work by intending to make sure work always pays . ‘Last year he said there would be a million people on Universal Credit by next April,’ said Mr Byrne. ‘I think it was also said new applications for benefits by this October would be for Universal Credit. ‘Both of those targets have disappeared but no new targets have come back into their place. Who on earth knows what’s going on?’ A spokesman for Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘This is a last-ditch attempt by Liam Byrne to keep his job in the Shadow Cabinet. Nothing more.’","Work and pensions spokesman Liam Byrne criticised Iain Duncan Smith .

Nice and naughty: A reveler shows off her helper costume in Herald Square, near Penn Station . Keeping warm: Santa Con party people keep each other warm against the freezing December chills . Taxi!: After a long day, revelers attempt to get home. Where's the sleigh? Onesie party: Despite not wearing much at all, these two are still interested in stripping off . Heading home: It's heard getting a taxi on Santa Con when you're dressed as, well, Santa . Taking a break: More more than 30 Manhattan bars  opened their doors to the annual bar crawl this year . Santa Con: Organizers agreed to start early and restrict themselves to bars in Midtown Manhattan . Insisting it is their First Amendment right to parade, SantaCon's leaders refused to back down - and started yesterday's march with a press conference to explain the legalities of it. And with thousands of New Yorkers simultaneously demonstrating against police killings, the organizers pledged to remain respectful and celebrate indoors - mostly in Midtown - leaving the streets to protesters. They gathered participants and NYPD officers in Times Square this morning to hear from their pro-bono attorney, Norman Siegel - who notably represented 'Ebola nurse' Kaci Hickox during her dispute with New Jersey authorities. 'People should understand that whether they agree or disagree with [SantaCon's] message, which is the over-commercialization of Christmas, it doesn't matter,' Siegel declared, according to Gothamist. 'It doesn't matter what the content of their message is. The First Amendment means that the government cannot prohibit [SantaCon's] expression. They can reasonably regulate their expression, but they can't prohibit it, that would be censorship.' Siegel noted that the participants should be respectful of the demonstrations being held throughout New York City today against police killings. They're instructing participants to stick to bars that welcome them and party inside instead of on the streets. Pledge: Leaders, flanked by their attorney Norman Siegel, told police and reporters they will be respectful . All fun and games: Participants chatted amicably with cops as they got ready to hit Hell's Kitchen bars . Route: The parade will see bar crawlers celebrate across a chain of Hell's Kitchen and midtown pubs . Siegel said he will be requesting a permit for next year's march, adding: 'This is America, you can't ban people from walking on public streets and being in public spaces. 'That's not what America is all about. The government can't be calling bars and telling the bars that they can't allow SantaCon to come in. That's a no-no. 'And if in fact that has been happening, we've been telling the government agencies they should cease and desist that kind of activity.' Aficionados say SantaCon is lighthearted communal fun that tweaks the nose of Christmastime consumerism. Participants are urged to bring gifts to hand out or prepare performances, and organizers stress that last year's event raised about $60,000 for charities. 'It was truly a spectacle of epic proportions' when Liz McManus went for the first time in 2010 at age 22, enjoying a day of singing, laughter and making new acquaintances. She went twice more but has been put off by reports of misbehavior since. Some residents see SantaCon as an onslaught of crass Kringles, soused elves and anything-but-grandmotherly Mrs Clauses. There have been two arrests and 85 summonses for disorderly conduct, open alcohol containers and other offenses during the last two SantaCons, and an online video captured people in Santa suits fighting on the evening of last year's SantaCon. One Mrs Claus poses for photos in Times Square on Saturday morning as the crowd begins to grow . Excitement: The crowds insisted it is their First Amendment right to parade and raise money for charity . 'Bit of fun': Aficionados insist the event is a tongue-in-cheek nod to Christmas consumerism . Festivities: These girls took a snap of their outfits before parading with the hundreds through New York . Tour de force: Despite the dispute, the crowd was buzzing. Another march held today will protest cop killings . 'Pro: The event raises money for kids that need therapy,' host Jimmy Fallon said on NBC's 'The Tonight Show' this week. 'Con: Specifically, the ones that need therapy after seeing Santa take a leak behind a dumpster.' Bar owners are split, with some welcoming the daytime business and others saying SantaCon is too rowdy. Anti-Con sentiment started peaking last year, as residents of Manhattan's bar-filled Lower East Side posted 'SantaCon free zone' signs, local commuter railroads began banning alcoholic drinks on their trains during the gathering, and a police lieutenant suggested to midtown Manhattan bars that the event hurt the neighborhood, though the then-police commissioner expressed support for it. With prodding from city and state officeholders, organizers let police and community leaders know their planned route and tasked volunteers with helping keep participants in line. Anti-Con sentiment started peaking last year with 'SantaCon free zone' signs set up in the Lower East Side . Can hold them down: City officials conceded that the sheer scale of the crawl makes it hard to ban . 'Santa Loves NYC': One said: 'NYC Santa realizes that he has a responsibility to New York City and its citizens' But 'all those efforts really don't make up for the fact that this is a group of people who largely come to drink,' state Senator Brad Hoylman said Friday. 'It amounts to an epic pub crawl that is very difficult to control.' Thoughts of bringing the event to Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood this year were scuttled as a city councilman urged bars not to participate and the Parks Department said no to using a local park as a meet-up point. And Hoylman, state Assemblyman Richard Gottfried and City Councilman Corey Johnson sent organizers a letter Friday urging them not to return to Hell's Kitchen in future. But for now, SantaCon is coming to town with a nice-not-naughty message. 'NYC Santa realizes that he has a responsibility to New York City and its citizens,' the organizers say on their website.

"With a £40,000 price tag per night, it's a holiday that's out of reach for most of us, save those with the deepest of pockets. Luckily, there's another way you can have a snoop around Sir Richard Branson's Necker Island holiday retreat without spending a penny (save the cost of your TV license). BBC2 cameras are going behind the scenes at the Virgin mogul's Caribbean island hideaway as part of a new season of TV shows about the super-rich. Home sweet home: A one-off TV show will show viewers around Branson's Necker Island pile . Cash ready: It  cost guests up to £40,000 a night to stay at Sir Richard's Caribbean island hideaway . The one-off documentary, Inside Necker Island, is described as 'an intimate portrait of how the rich, powerful and famous holiday'. Sir Richard bought the island in 1978 when he was just 27 and opened it as a luxury retreat for private hire in 1984. Guests can expect to pay up to £40,000 a night and are waited on by around 100 staff. It hit the headlines three years ago when Oscar-winner Kate Winslet had to carry Sir Richard's 90-year-old mother, Eve, to safety when a fire broke out in the multi-millionaire businessman's house. The blaze severely damaged the island's Great House, however it was rebuilt a year later. Other planned programmes include journalist Jacques Peretti examining how the arrival of the very rich has changed the UK and a one-off documentary about the lives of wealthy Russians who have made their home in London. Before the fire: An image of the island before it was devastated by a blaze which damaged the Great House . Luxury: This year the property was voted first in a survey of celebrity houses Brits would most like to stay in . BBC2 controller Kim Shillinglaw said: 'From exposing the jaw-dropping luxury in which the richest one per cent of society live to exploring the impact such lifestyle extremes have on contemporary Britain, this will be a fascinating and thought-provoking season of films for BBC2.' Earlier this year Necker Island was voted first in a survey of top celebrity houses Brits would most like to stay in, bumping Buckingham Palace into second place. Past guests of the sunny retreat include Princess Diana, Mariah Carey, Robert De Niro and Steven Spielberg and the private island house has eight guest rooms, each with a balcony, king-sized bed and en-suite bathroom. Room with a view: The main house on Necker Island as it was before the fire . A 1,500 square feet master suite sits upstairs that has been specifically designed to give panoramic views of the Caribbean, the Atlantic Ocean and neighbouring islands and includes a two-person Jacuzzi. The Virgin mogul also owns Makepeace Island in Queensland, Australia, a heart-shaped island which you can rent for holidays at a cost of £2,000 a day plus £350 a day per guest, for up to 22 people.","One-off BBC2 documentary  to go behind the scenes at Caribbean island .

"A dog who was rescued ten years ago from the flooded aftermath of Hurricane Katrina is now helping other abandoned animals at the Arizona Humane Society, as a 'nanny' in the organization's new kitten nursery. The Chow-Golden Retriever mix named Boots is helping the five to eight-week old kittens socialize and adjust to being around other animals, which make them better candidates for adoption. Calm Boots lets the little kittens snuggle up and play, without so much as a bark or growl. Scroll down for video . Kitten's best friend: Boots, a dog who was rescued in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, is now living with his new owner in Phoenix, Arizona where he also volunteers once a week in a kitten nursery at the Arizona Humane Society . Back rub for Boots: Docile Boots helps the new kittens socialize and adjust to being around dogs which make them better candidates for adoption . 'He doesn’t care about what the kittens [do]. He doesn’t get excited. He doesn’t get in their face,' Humane Society's Liz Truitt said . 'He’s been an unofficial nanny for us. When he came into the nursery, he was the perfect dog for this role, because he’s so laid-back,' the Humane Society's Liz Truitt told NBC Today. 'He doesn’t care about what the kittens [do]. He doesn’t get excited. He doesn’t get in their face. He just basically lets them come to him on their terms. It’s the perfect first interaction with a dog for these guys.' The reason for Boots' stoic personality may have to do with the fact that he lived through Hurricane Katrina  nearly a decade ago - which is how he got his name. 'His paws were so ripped up, he had (such) intense burns on his paws that he needed medical attention — hence, how he got the name Boots,' Bretta Nelson, a spokeswoman for the humane society, said of Boots who was just two years old at the time. Pounce: Boots was one of 300 dogs rescued in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina, and unfortunately he was never reunited with his original owners. Luckily though, one volunteer with the Arizona Humane Society adopted Boots and he now lives with her in Phoenix . A cat dog: The Chow-Golden Retriever mix started volunteering in the kitten nursery because he interacts so well his his owner Susan Juergensen's cats at home . Boots got his name from his paws, which were so torn up after Hurricane Katrina that he required surgery . Above, a picture of a younger Boots  after he was rescued from Hurricane Katrina . Boots was one of the 300 dogs found abandoned in New Orleans after the hurricane, and one of the 240 that were never reunited with their owners. But volunteers with the Arizona Humane Society took a shining to Boots and he was adopted by volunteer Susan Juergensen who took him to live at her home in Phoenix, along with her cats. Because he got along so well with his new owner's cats, Boots seemed a perfect dog to help the kittens in the AHS' new kitten nursery, which opened in May. Now Boots visits the nursery once a week to interact with the kittens, who appear very comfortable around the much-bigger dog in pictures posted to the society's Facebook page.","Boots, a Chow-Golden Retriever mix, was one of the 300 dogs found abandoned in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina in 2005 .

"Tony Blair looks more 'Mr Red' than ex-government head as he channels his inner Tarantino in Manhattan yesterday. The former British Prime Minister went for an afternoon stroll through New York City flanked by three besuited bodyguards in scenes reminiscent of the film Reservoir Dogs. Wearing a dark suit and white shirt, he strode the sidewalk with purpose, protected on all sides by a detail of hired muscle. But the casual observer could have been forgiven for assuming it was a bizarre re-enactment of the opening credits of Quentin Tarantino's acclaimed 1992 crime caper - starring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi - where the protagonists walk towards the camera each wearing black suits. Mr Red, I presume? The former British Prime Minister went for an afternoon stroll through New York City flanked by three besuited bodyguards in scenes reminiscent of the film Reservoir Dogs .

Muscle: Wearing a dark suit and white shirt, he strode the sidewalk with purpose, protected on all sides by a detail of hired muscle . He was in New York to receive an honour from humanitarian charity Save The Children at a star-studded ceremony in the city. Mr Blair, who set Britain on course towards spending 0.7 per cent of its national income on overseas aid, was given the Save The Children Global Legacy Award in recognition of his leadership in international development. Award: He was in New York to receive an honour from humanitarian charity Save The Children at a star-studded ceremony in the city (left). Pictured right: ‘Mr Red’ in a past life with Mr Brown . There, Mr Blair hobnobbed with Hollywood stars as guest of honour at the ceremony. Even the latest incarnation of Lassie the dog was among the guests, along with actor and director Ben Affleck, his wife Jennifer Garner and actress Dakota Fanning. As prime minister, Mr Blair set up the Department for International Development and hosted a series of aid summits. Critics say Britain’s foreign aid budget – which hit £11.4billion last year – has led to a string of perverse outcomes, including spending millions in countries such as India which can afford its own space programme. Looking sharp: Mr Blair rubbed shoulders with Hollywood royalty including Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner as guest of honour at the star-studded event . Hero dog: Lassie, or rather her latest incarnation, was also among the guests at the sumptuous gala event . Accepting his award last night, Mr Blair said: ‘From the beginning of humankind there has been brutality, conflict, intrigue, the destructive obsession with a narrow self-interest. But throughout all human history, never has been extinguished that relentless, unquenchable desire to do good. To act not only in self-interest and sometimes to even to act in defiance of it.’ A spokesman for Save The Children said: ‘The UK’s achievement of 0.7 per cent of gross national income to international aid in 2014 is the culmination of work started under [Mr Blair’s] leadership.’ But Philip Davies, Conservative MP for Shipley, said: ‘I am not sure that giving overseas aid to China and India and setting us on the path to the biggest crash in a century is anything to celebrate.’ Andrew Rosindell, Tory MP for Romford, said: ‘This award is undeserved and frankly I think most British people will find it totally inappropriate that someone who has left the country bankrupt is honoured in this way.’","Tony Blair was in New York to receive humanitarian award at glitzy bash .

The 30-year-old social network billionaire had his wealth set at $34.7billion, just over a decade after he launched thefacebook.com from his Harvard dorm room. His huge increase in wealth in the past year - the biggest in the Forbes 400 - netting him a nine-place gain from twentieth in 2013, when his wealth stood at $19billion. Not far behind Zuckerberg were Google founders Larry Page (#13, $31.7billion) and Sergey Brin (#14, $31.2billion), Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos (#15, $29.9billion). A keen grasp of technology - especially social media - is the key ingredient that opened the doors to unimaginable wealth for the under-40s of the Forbes 400 list. Top of the pile is Mark Zuckerberg, whose $34billion fortune sees him at spot 10 on the list aged just 30. Golden youth: Elizabeth Holmes, left, and Dustin Moskovitz, right, are both 30-year-old billionaires . He is followed by former Harvard roommate Dustin Moskovitz, whose Facebook fortune netted him $8.2billion. While not nearly so rich, he is a few months younger than Zuckerberg, . Also just out of her twenties is Elizabeth Holmes, 30, whose $4.5billion comes from blood testing company Theranos, which she founded after dropping out of college. Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, Uber and GoPro have also helped most of the other under-40s on the list into their spots. Another long-standing giant on the Forbes list is investment guru Warren Buffett, 84, ranked second with a $68billion fortune. The Forbes 400 list saw an influx of app founders this year, after mobile technology took another leap. The founders of the WhatsApp messaging service, Jan Koum (#61, $7.7billion) and Brian Acton (#158, $3.4billion), joined the list after Facebook bought their company for $19billion in February. WhatsApp billionaires Jan Kuom (left) and Brian Acton (right) joined the Forbes 400 this year . Travis Kalanick, (#202, $3billion), who invented taxi app Uber, also found himself among the rich after his company was valued at $18.2billion this summer. Twitter cofounder Evan Williams (#178, £3.2billion), also sailed into the list on the back of the company's IPO in November, which valued the company at $25billion. He joins Jack Dorsey, former Twitter CEO, on the list. Dorsey was ranked 240th with a $2.6billion fortune. The so-called Sage of Omaha, CEO of investment firm Berkshire Hathaway, saw his wealth rocket this year thanks to a buoyant stock market, which took shares in his company above $200,000 a piece. He managed to keep his coveted spot near the top despite having reportedly given away some $23billion in his lifetime. Even the lowest entrant to the Forbes 400, biotechnology magnate Alan Auerbach, has $1.4billion to his name, and the magazine reported that 113 U.S. billionaires were deemed too poor to be included. The $2.3trillion total worth of the list is a hike of $270billion from last year, an increase of almost 12 per cent. The average fortune on the list was $5.7billion, up from $5billion last year. More than three quarters of the list saw their values climb in the past year, with only 36 losing money. Despite the clear influence of internet and tech phenomena such as Facebook and Amazon in the upper echelons, the top 20 was still dominated by long-standing titans of the American economy. Joint for fourth place on the list - at $42.9billion each - were Charles and David Koch, overlords of Koch Industries, a giant company with interests in the oil industry, building and manufacturing. The were followed by members Walton family - Christy, Jim and Alice - who derive astonishing fortunes - $38.3billion, $36.6billion and $35.2billion respectively - from the Walmart retail empire founded by Sam Walton. The most dizzying rise on the list was from GoPro founder Nick Woodman, whose camera company has seen his wealth increase threefold since last year, giving him a total of $3.9billion thanks to huge sales of his devices, beloved of extreme sportsmen.

"Animosity: Dee Presley during 'Elvis: We Love You Tender' Book Party - January 8, 1980 at the Navarro Hotel in New York City, New York . She has been dubbed the King of Rock and Roll's 'evil stepmother' - the lady who waited until after his tragically young death to claim he not only had a gay affair but also engaged in an incestuous relationship with his beloved mother. Dead at the age of 88 at her home in Nashville, Tennessee, Davada 'Dee' Stanley Presley was the second wife of Elvis's dad Vernon, but as far as his hundreds of millions of fans are concerned she was no better than a gold-digger intent on ruining his stellar legacy. As for Elvis himself, his dislike bordered on open hate, succinctly summed up by his wife Priscilla, who claimed the King 'couldn't stand her'. It was only after he was found dead . on his bathroom floor at his Memphis mansion Graceland in August 1977 . that Dee began to spout her claims about Elvis's private life and drug . abuse. In many . televised appearances and in two much-maligned books, Dee made numerous . allegations including the unsubstantiated claim that Elvis in fact . killed himself after discovering he had untreatable bone-marrow cancer. She . also said that Elvis's marriage to Priscilla in 1967, already . controversial for their age difference and speculation about when they . first went to bed, was forced upon the singer. Unhappy .

Saving . her most jaw-dropping claims for the 1993 book 'The Intimate Life and . Death of Elvis Presley', Dee said that Elvis had become involved in an . incestuous affair with his mother Gladys, who died in 1958. She repeated this on national television and said she was told this by the family’s long-serving maid and Elvis's grandmother Minnie. 'Elvis's dislike of Dee bordered on hate....his wife Priscilla said that 'he couldn't stand her' And if the claim that Elvis Presley, the biggest star rock and roll has ever known, slept with his mother wasn't enough, Dee's book made the allegation that he had an affair with Nick Adams, an Oscar nominated actor and star of ABC's iconic series 'The Rebel', who died of a prescription drug overdose in 1968. However, many believed Dee's claims were motivated by petty jealously and vengeance aimed at Elvis for ruining her marriage to Vernon, which ended in November 1977, three months after Elvis's untimely death and 18 months before Vernon himself passed away. Loving Son: Memphis, Tennessee, USA --- Singer Elvis Presley kisses his mother, Gladys, on the eve of his induction into the Army. At left is his father, Vernon . Family bond: Elvis Presley, on his first leave from the Army, escorts his parents, Mr. and Mrs. Presley, from their mansion here to town for a sneak preview of the entertainer's latest movie, 'King Creole' In an interview published in the Lakeland Ledger in 1980 she said: 'Vernon was more married to Elvis than to me. He is ultimately what caused the deterioration of my marriage. He was incredibly selfish... like a black hole that totally sucks in everything around it.' Looking the total opposite of dark haired and dark eyed Gladys Presley, Dee, who died on September 28th, first saw Elvis as he played a show in Newport News, Virginia, in 1955. It was the year before he rocketed into celebrity orbit with hits such as Heartbreak Hotel, Blue Suede Shoes and Hound Dog. However it was another three years later in Friedberg, Germany, where they first met as Elvis was serving with Dee's then husband, Sgt. William Stanley, in the U.S. Army. Elvis's father had joined his son in Germany after the death in August 1958 of Gladys - which many say the King never truly got over or recovered from. Devotion: The graves of Elvis Presley (2-L), his Aunt Minnie (L), father Vernon (2-R) and mother Gladys (R) surrounded with memorial tributes from fans at Graceland, Elvis Presley's home in Memphis, Tennessee, USA . Dee set up a coffee date with the two to express her condolences, but when she arrived she discovered that Elvis had failed to show and left his father to meet the pretty blonde according to the Daily Mirror of the United Kingdom. Indeed, it has been speculated that Dee in fact had set her sights onto Elvis, but he apparently at age 24 was not interested in a 29-year-old woman, . 'He is ultimately what caused the deterioration of my marriage. He was incredibly selfish... like a black hole that totally sucks in everything around it.'....Dee Stanley Presley on her stepson Elvis . However, to Elvis's horror a romance blossomed between 52-year-old Vernon and Dee and in April 1960 Dee divorced her husband and settled down with Presley. This caused Elvis to fly into a rage at the thought that his father could even contemplate marrying again so soon after the death of his mother. Long recognized as the most important woman in Elvis's life, outstripping the impact of Priscilla whom he famously dedicated his hit 'You Were Always on My Mind' to, Gladys' death devastated the singer. In fact, next to his grave at Graceland is where Gladys is also buried, a site of pilgramage for the millions who descend on the Memphis mansion every year. Doting on his mother, Elvis bought Gladys a pink Cadillac when he became a global sensation, but she was prone to depression and her worries caused her to turn to drink. Loggerheads: Elvis in 1957 - every inch the icon (left) and Davada 'Dee' Stanley Presley who died on September 28th at her home in Nashville, Tennessee after releasing two controversial books on her stepson . Her excessive consumption of alcohol led her to develop liver damage and ultimately the hepatitis that killed her. Elvis was away with the Army when she passed away and when he returned home his aunt Lilian described the harrowing scene as he closed the door to where her body was lying and began to cry out loud. 'She’s all we lived for, she was always my best girl,' said Elvis according to the Daily Mirror. At her funeral the King threw himself over her body, screaming for her to come back to him and as she lay in the coffin he touchingly brushed her hair with his hands. 'He couldn’t stop touching her, kissing her, and whispering to her... ‘Just look at Mama, look at those hands of God, those hands toiled to raise me’. He carried around her nightgown, clutching it tightly even when he slept.' Those family members who knew Elvis well said that after her death, 'He never seemed like Elvis again.' Bloated: American rock singer Elvis Presley , wearing his iconic white rhinestone-studded suit performing in 1975 . Once he returned from the Army to begin his questionable film career, Elvis's relationship with Dee was best described as chilly. However, he did eventually offer her three sons jobs in his entourage known as the 'Memphis Mafia' and bought her and his father a home on Dolan Drive in an upmarket area of Memphis. These three boys became so engrained and trusted by Elvis that they became known as his 'TCBs' - 'Taking Care of Business.' However, no doubt the Memphis Mafia was tight, but according to other friends the group could possibly share some of the blame for Elvis's descent in drugs as they could never say no to him. One of Dee's sons, David Stanley, wrote after Elvis's death, 'I have never seen a human being in my life abuse drugs like Elvis. 'I am not talking about street drugs, I am talking about prescribed drugs. Some of the doctors were out for the almighty buck.' Some have claimed that one of the reasons for Dee's animosity towards Elvis later in her life was because he welcomed everyone of her family into his - apart from her. Her 1980 book, 'Elvis: We Love You Tender', is described as 'The story of a wife and mother, her sons and how it felt to have the major portion of our lives consumed by Elvis's own life.' After his death she seemed to blame Elvis for her own sons descent into drug use. 'Elvis was a drug addict and none of us could admit it until after he was gone,' she said.

'There wasn’t a person in the world that would say no to him. If there was a woman or man strong enough, Elvis would be alive today.' 'His stepbrothers worshiped him and anything Elvis did, they did,' she said. But did Elvis feel some remorse? Dee believes so. She described him crying to her sons once and asking, 'Poor little Dee, poor little Dee, what have I done?' But Dee claimed she always loved Elvis. 'I couldn't hate him for causing me tragedy,' she said to the Lakeland Ledger. 'For taking my husband and my sons away....Elvis was really just as victimized as we were.' Defending her right to pen her own account of her time with Elvis, she justified it as taking back what had been lost to her. 'How could I exploit it any more than it has already been exploited? And besides, we all gave our lives to Elvis. Now maybe we’re just trying to take a little something back.'","Davada 'Dee' Stanley Presley has died at home in Nashville, Tennessee .

"A police chief has described in detail the 'shocking' footage of the moment a Google executive suffered a lethal heroin overdose on his yacht with a high-end escort. Father-of-five Forrest Hayes, 51, had just taken up a job at the top secret Google X office - where the firm makes unimaginable inventions a reality - when he died in Santa Cruz, California, in November 2013. The only other person aboard the yacht was Alix Tichelman, 27, who will be tried for manslaughter, drug charges and prostitution on February 23. She is pleading not guilty. And the entire case hangs on a video of the entire night. It took three months and a court order to obtain the footage - which changed everything. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Intense detail: Police describe a video that allegedly shows high-end escort Alex Tichelman, 27, (left) giving Forrest Hayes, 51, (right) a lethal dose of heroin aboard his yacht, before 'cleaning up and walking out' Pleading not guilty: Tichelman will appear in court on February 23 where she will deny manslaughter charges . 'Initially, we were told that the video wasn't available from that particular camera - that actually showed the cabin of the boat. There was indeed video that was uploaded to a cloud server. And the video from that camera was indeed available,' Santa Cruz Deputy Police Chief Steve Clark tells 48 Hours in a new documentary about the case. 'That was one of those moments where you feel like, you know, it was 4th and 1. And you got a first down.' Actually, it took three months and a court order for detectives to get their hands on that video. When they did, it was explosive. 'That video was shocking to me,' said Clark, according to CBS. 'Well, the video's everything. The video is the case.' Describing the footage, which has not been seen by the public, Clark tells reporter Maureen Maher: 'They greet each other - a quick hug - just a quick embrace. You can see that they're engaged in conversation. But there's no audio,' Clark said. 'Then, eventually, she gets to the point where she starts to prepare drugs... for injection. 'We see her very clearly. She brought all of the equipment with her. She brought the drugs with her. 'We see her prepare the syringe. We see her - it looks like she's injecting herself, but her back's to the camera. 'He watches this happen. And then she eventually injects him.' Clark adds: 'I get the impression... he's nervous. He's uncertain. But he's going along with it. 'Almost immediately, he starts to go into distress. At some point, she comes to him. It looks like she tries to revive him a bit... by patting him on the face and talking to him, holding his head as he slumped forward on the chair. 'And you or I, if we found ourselves in that situation, would've been on the phone to 911, saying: ""Oh, my gosh. Something terrible's happened. We need help."" And she does none of that.' In a move that will likely prove crucial to the case, Clark says, Tichelman is seen cleaning up the drugs, wiping fingerprints from the scene, then stepping over Hayes's lifeless body to leave. 'She is literally walking around the cabin of the boat... stepping over him, grabbing her glass of wine, carrying it around the boat cabin with her,' he says. Accusations: Police claim a video shows Tichelman watching Hayes die before stepping over him . On board: Tichelman's lawyers want police to release a surveillance video taken from the Santa Cruz yacht where Hayes was found which they claim proves it was an accidental, consensual overdose of heroin . For seven minutes, he tells Maher, Hayes is left alone. 'And that's seven minutes that emergency medical personnel could've been there could have done something and could have reacted to this situation to save Mr. Hayes' life. But instead, she does nothing, nothing to call for help or to fix this. You know, and that's the crux of the case,' Clark said. Clark's words come as Tichelman prepares for her trial, beginning in February. Tichelman has pleaded not guilty to charges of manslaughter, prostitution and transportation and sales of narcotics. She remains jailed in lieu of $1.5 million bond. 'We've always been curious in regard to Mr. Hayes' receptiveness, if not welcoming purchase, of drugs,' public defender Jerry Christensen told the judge on Friday. 'It would make a great deal of difference in regard to the drug crimes.' At her latest court appearance, in December, Tichelman rolled her eyes at camera crews and reporters as she entered the courtroom dressed in orange jail garb. Tichelman, 27, was arrested eight months later after police discovered the harbor's surveillance video. The squad lured her to her arrest by using a fake social media profile, posing as a potential client. 'My client Alix didn't do anything to Mr Hayes that he didn't want to happen to him,' defense attorney Larry Biggam said at a procedural hearing today, according to NBC. 'She did what she was asked. Consensual adults involved in mutual drug usage. It went wrong but it wasn't intended.' Biggam also called on police to release the full surveillance video taken from the boat, which prosecutors are using as evidence for a number of allegations. Her defense team has only seen 20 minutes of the footage described in court but Biggam insists it shows the overdose was 'accidental'. She now faces eight charges which all carry 15-year jail terms, including manslaughter, prostitution, destroying evidence and several related to administering and possessing heroin. Tichelman, who met her clients through a website called Seeking Arrangement, had exchanged texts and emails with Hayes and met with him a few times before the deadly November 26 encounter. Charges: Tichelman is facing up to 15 years for  eight charges including manslaughter and prostitution . Lured: She was arrested after law enforcement officers posed as a client and lured her to a Santa Cruz hotel . That day, they met on Hayes' 50-foot yacht, Escape, at the Santa Cruz Small Craft Harbor and Tichelman brought heroin before injecting him with the drug, police said. Authorities launched a nine-month investigation into the incident before eventually uncovering Tichelman's correspondence with the victim. They then tracked her down to her home in Folsom, where she lives with her parents, but lured her back to Santa Cruz County by posing as a client who said he wanted to pay her $1,000 for sex. She agreed to meet at a luxury hotel on Fourth of July and was arrested. Hayes, who was originally from Dearborn, Michigan was married for 17 years to wife Denise and together they had five children, according to his obituary. He worked in the auto industry before senior roles at Apple and Google. 'Forrest will be remembered above all as a loving husband and father. More than anything else he enjoyed spending time with his family at home and on his boat,' according to a January obituary. 'His brilliant mind, contagious smile and warm embrace will be missed and cherished in memories by his friends and family.' Tichelman's Facebook profile shows she went to high school in Atlanta before majoring in journalism at Georgia State University and attending beauty school. She lists her occupation as a makeup artist. She called herself a 'model' in jail records. On social media, she poses in lingerie and pouts with red lips for the camera. In an interview with fiXE fETISH magazine, she said she loved modeling because she got to play a character. 'I have always been attracted to the darker side,' she said. 'My parents said by the time I was three I was an 'intense child' and already liked horror movies.' She added that she loved fetishism and would often wear a leash when she went out with her boyfriend. She also posted pictures under another Facebook profile, AK Kennedy, and talks about heroin and her love of the serial killer TV show, 'Dexter'. Seeking Arrangement, the website through which Tichelman and Hayes met, is described as being a site for connecting 'sugar babies' with 'sugar daddies and mommas' - but the company maintains it is not promoting prostitution.","Alex Tichelman, 26, 'injected father-of-five Forrest Hayes, 51, with heroin in November 2013 but did nothing when he had a reaction to the drug'

"George Osborne suffered a major setback in his pledge to balance the books today - after official figures showed borrowing had gone up over the past year. Borrowing spiked by £3.7billion – or 6.1 per cent – in the 12 months to October compared to the year before. It means Mr Osborne is well off the Government’s target to cut the deficit by 12 per cent this year. Britain's mounting debt pile has now hit £1.5 trillion - up £150 billion in just a year. Scroll down for video . George Osborne pledged to eliminate the deficit in five years, but has seen it rise over the past 12 months . The monthly figures from the Office for National Statistics are the last before the Chancellor delivers his autumn statement in a couple of weeks. October's data showed receipts from income tax and capital gains tax up 1.5 per cent on the same month last year. These are 0.4 per cent lower on the year-to-date, despite economic growth running at around 3 per cent and a surge in employment. The poor performance is blamed on the proportion of new jobs which are low-paid or part-time, meaning a lot of the new wages generated do not meet the £10,000 threshold for paying income tax. Central government current spending grew by £1.1 billion partly due to a £500 million increase in benefit spending which the Treasury said was a result of increases in the state pension. The UK's underlying debt was £1.449 trillion, a fall on the month before but higher when compared to the £1.352 trillion in October last year. It now represents 79.5 per cent of gross domestic product, down from September's 79.9 per cent but ahead of 77.7 per cent a year before. Labour's shadow chancellor Ed Balls has criticised the Government's record cutting the deficit . The overall scale of public sector debt was revised downwards as a result of Lloyds Banking Group being reclassified as a private sector body after the Government's share in it was reduced to 25 per cent. Net debt including the public sector banks had been £2.285 trillion in September or 125.8 per cent of GDP but this September figure has now been revised down by £522 billion to £1.763 trillion or 97 per cent of GDP. For October it fell slightly again to £1.761 trillion or 96.6 per cent. Chris Leslie MP, Labour’s Shadow Chief Secretary to the Treasury, responding to today’s public sector finance figures, said: ‘These figures are yet another damaging setback for George Osborne. ‘Borrowing so far this year is now £3.7 billion higher than the same period last year. George Osborne’s promise to balance the books by next year lies in tatters. As the OBR has said, stagnating wages and too many people in low-paid jobs are leading to more borrowing. ‘Labour will balance the books and get the national debt falling as soon as possible in the next Parliament, but we will do so in a fairer way. ‘Our economic plan will reverse the £3 billion tax cut for the top one£ of earners and stop paying the winter fuel allowance to the richest pensioners. We will raise child benefit by just one£ for two years and cut ministers’ pay by five. 'And our plan will deliver a recovery for the many not just a few, with the rising living standards and more good jobs we need to get the deficit down.’ But a Treasury spokesman said: ‘While today's public finance figures show borrowing is down this month compared to last year, the impact of the great recession is still being felt in our economy and the public finances. ‘At the same time, we have to recognise that the UK is not immune to the problems being experienced in Europe and other parts of the world economy. That's why we will continue working through the plan that is building a resilient British economy.’","Borrowing increased by £3.7 billion  in the 12 months to October .

"A woman killed herself the day after her beloved horse died. Stephanie Lees, 42, had devoted ten years to caring for Jake, who she rode in the fields and lanes around her rural village. When he became lame, she was heartbroken – and hours after he was put down, she committed suicide. Her family said she could not bear to be without him. Stephanie Lees, pictured riding Jake in 2009, took her own life after her beloved horse had to be put down . A neighbour said that she had died near where her horse was put to sleep, adding: ‘She was found with part of Jake’s mane in her hand.’ Her body was discovered by friends who she had planned to ride with that day, the neighbour said. Miss Lees, who was single and had no children, became even more attached to Jake after her other horse, Elliot, died three years ago. She had been unable to ride Jake for more than a year due to his ill health, and had struggled to cope as she watched the animal deteriorate. Miss Lees, pictured with her other horse Elliott in 2000, who was put to sleep in 2011 . A week before the tragedy, Jake had an operation which was at first deemed a success. But he grew worse and it became clear that he would not survive. Josephine Lees said her daughter killed herself in response to his death, saying: ‘Steph couldn’t bear to be parted from Jake and made a decision to join him.’ Mrs Lees, 74, added: ‘It was really the loss of Jake which broke her heart. He had gone lame about 18 months ago and had to be put down the day before. She hadn’t been able to ride him and devoted most of her spare time to looking after him. She absolutely adored him.’ Mrs Lees and her husband John were told of their daughter’s death by police on Remembrance Sunday this month. She said: ‘We are devastated and heartbroken.’ Mr Lees, 79, said: ‘She just wanted to join him, which is in some ways a happy thing, but also very sad. ‘She was very much loved. We’ve had about 200 cards from people.’ Miss Lees kept 20-year-old Jake in a field near her home in Cawthorne, South Yorkshire. She worked as a surveyor for Barnsley Council – but spent much of her time with horses, training in dressage and riding with the Rockwood Harriers hunt. At her funeral on Tuesday, friends followed her coffin on horseback. They recalled a ‘wonderful, caring and patient’ woman. One wrote online: ‘Steph was a sunbeam. The prettiest smile in the village and a fine horsewoman. Unbearably sad to think she’s gone from us.’ An inquest to determine the exact cause of death is yet to be opened, pending toxicology test results. Miss Lees started riding when she was 10 and was a member of Rockwood Harriers hunt in Cawthorne . Her parents did not know Jake (pictured with Stephanie) had been put down until police arrived on their door to inform them of their daughter's death on November 9 .

"The seven-week Gaza conflict halted last night, but now Israel faces attacks on another front after Al-Qaeda's Syrian wing the Nusra Front and the Western-backed Free Syrian Army seized control of the crossing between Syria and the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. It was a fierce battle with President Bashar Assad's forces that left 20 government soldiers and four rebels dead, and an Israeli officer wounded. The capture of the Quneitra crossing on Syria's de facto border in the Golan - the only official crossing between Syria and Israel - held more symbolic value than strategic, but rebels said it would provide relief to nearby villages that were under siege by government troops. Scroll down for video . Smoke rises at the Syrian-Israeli border as a result of the fighting between the Syrian army and rebels over the control of the border crossing of Quneitra . An Israeli woman looks out from binoculars at the smoke rising at the Quneitra border crossing . 'Al-Nusra Front and other rebel groups took the Quneitra crossing, and heavy fighting with the Syrian army is continuing in the surrounding area,' said Rami Abdel Rahman, head of the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Rebel fighters captured the Syrian side of the sole crossing over the armistice line on Wednesday morning in a deadly battle with government troops. Stray mortar fire into the Golan left an Israeli officer moderately wounded, with the army saying that it immediately launched a counter-attack. 'In response to the errant fire from the internal fighting in Syria, which hit Israel earlier today and injured an IDF (Israel Defence Forces) officer, the IDF just targeted two Syrian army positions in the Syrian Golan Heights. Hits were confirmed,' it said in a statement. This afternoon, Lieutenant Colonel Peter Lerner told AFP: 'From what we know, opposition forces overran the Syrian regime forces on the Syrian side of the Quneitra crossing, some of those including the Al-Nusra Front, which ultimately leave the crossing in the opposition forces' hands.' The capture of the Quneitra crossing on Syria's de facto border in the Golan - the only official crossing between Syria and Israel - held more symbolic value than strategic for the rebel . The fighting at the crossing with the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights began on Wednesday morning . Smoke rises at the Syrian-Israeli border after the heavy clashes . Israeli tourists peer down at the scene of the conflict, which left 24 dead . 'We have declared a closed military zone in the immediate area of the crossing and the roads leading to it. We are prepared for any potential spillover effect into Israel,' he said. 'The opposition forces including the Al-Nusra Front have been on the border area for some time now, but this is not necessarily an increased threat (to Israel), . 'These forces have said multiple times that when they are done with Syria, they will head to Israel. Their hands are tied up in Syria at the moment, so we have to be prepared for that development.' Earlier the army said it had responded by hitting two Syrian army posts. As a result of the fighting on the Syrian-controlled side of the plateau, the level of alert was raised on the Israeli side, a spokeswoman said, without confirming that it had been increased to the highest level. On Sunday, at least five rockets hit the Israeli-occupied side of the plateau, all of which were due to stray fire, the army said. In June, an Israeli teenager was killed in a deliberate cross-border attack, which prompted Israeli warplanes to attack Syrian military headquarters and positions. Israel, which is technically at war with Syria, seized 1,200 square kilometres (460 square miles) of the Golan Heights during the 1967 Six-Day War and later annexed it in a move never recognised by the international community. Since the Syrian conflict erupted in 2011, the plateau has been tense, with a growing number of rockets and mortar rounds hitting the Israeli side, mostly stray, prompting occasional armed responses. The armistice line is patrolled by a UN peacekeeping force. that has been increasingly depleted by the withdrawal of contributing nations' troops in the face of the persistent fire. The Philippines said Saturday it would repatriate its 331-strong contingent in the UN Disengagement Observer Force mirroring previous moves by Australia, Croatia and Japan. Israel has avoided taking sides in the war, but has responded when the violence has spilled across the border. Gen. Ibrahim Jbawi, the spokesman for the Free Syrian Army's southern front, confirmed the rebel gains, as did the Local Coordination Committees activist group. Kenan Mohammed, a spokesman for the Western-backed Syrian opposition, said rebels aimed to push Assad's troops from all of Quneitra. He also said opposition forces posed no threat to Israel. 'Our aim isn't Israel right now, and we in the FSA haven't targeted Israeli lands,' he said, adding that the rebels' focus is on Assad and the extremist Islamic State group. 'The matter of Israel - it's not for now, and it's more political.' A Palestinian boy emerges from a hole in a destroyed house in Gaza City's Shijaiyah neighborhood, today. It was demolished in airstrikes before yesterday's ceasefire . Mourners attend the funeral of Shahar Melamed, who was killed yesterday in the Kibutz by a mortar launched from Gaza strip shortly before the ceasefire happened . As the ceasefire between Hamas and Israel continues many people who fled their homes in Rafa in southern Gaza return to their homes as a result of the truce . Both Israel's Prime Minister and Hamas have declared victory in the Gaza war, though their competing claims left questions over the future of their uneasy ceasefire. Benjamin Netanyahu's comments, delivered in a prime-time address on national television, appeared aimed at countering critics of the war, with both hard-liners in his governing coalition and residents of rocket-scarred southern Israel saying the war was a failure because it did not halt Hamas's rocket attacks or oust the group from power. Masked Hamas militants carrying heavy weapons gave their own address upon the rubble of one destroyed Gaza neighbourhood, though their own major demands will not be addressed until indirect talks with Israel begin again in Cairo. Israel and Hamas agreed to an open-ended truce yesterday, with each side settling for an ambiguous interim agreement in exchange for a period of calm. One of the final Israeli acts of the two-month long conflict was an airstrike on the 15-storey Basha Tower in Gaza city which was one of the tallest buildings in the region . Now that the fighting as stopped, civilians in Palestinian civilians are beginning the task of assessing the damage caused by the heavy Israeli bombardment . Due to the difficulty of securing supplies of concrete and blocks in Gaza, Palestinian civilians have had to improvise methods of repairing their damaged homes . Hamas, though badly battered, remains in control of Gaza with part of its military arsenal intact. Israel and Egypt will continue to control access to blockaded Gaza, despite Hamas's long-running demand that the border closures imposed in 2007 be lifted. Hamas is seeking an end to the Israeli blockade, including the reopening of Gaza's sea and airport. It also wants Egypt to reopen its Rafah border crossing, the territory's main gateway to the outside world. Under the restrictions, virtually all of Gaza's 1.8 million people cannot trade or travel. Only a few thousand are able to leave the coastal territory every month. Israel, meanwhile, wants Hamas to be disarmed. 'Hamas was hit hard and it received not one of the demands it set forth for a ceasefire, not one,' Mr Netanyahu said. He said Israel 'will not tolerate' any more rocket fire, and would respond 'even harder' if the attacks resume. Addressing the future of Gaza, the Israeli premier that should Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas 'choose peace' he would be happy for the Palestinian leader to regain control of the coastal enclave, which the Islamic militant group Hamas has ruled since it routed Mr Abbas's forces in 2007. Mr Netanyahu indicated that as long as Hamas was in power, reaching a negotiated solution to the conflict with the Palestinians was impossible. Other people have been forced to salvage their belongings from their badly damaged homes which have cannot be repaired . Some of the people face an uncertain future as they try and save as many of their possessions which were not destroyed during the repeated attacks . In Gaza, masked militants gathered on the rubble of destroyed homes in the Shijaiyah neighbourhood, site of some of the heaviest fighting, to declare victory. The men displayed heavy machine guns, mortar shells, rockets and anti-tank missiles. Hundreds of residents gathered around the militants, taking pictures with them and their weapons. Abu Obeida, a spokesman for the Hamas military wing, stood over an Israeli flag as he addressed the crowd. 'Gaza achieved victory because it has done what major armies failed to do. It forced the enemy to retreat,' he said. 'We must know that no voice is louder than the voice of the resistance.' Life slowly returned to normal in Gaza today, as traffic policemen took up their positions in streets overwhelmed by vehicles transporting thousands of people back to the homes they had abandoned during the fighting. Harried utility crews struggled to repair electricity and water infrastructure damaged by weeks of Israeli airstrikes. 'We are going back today,' said farmer Radwan al-Sultan, 42, as he and some of his seven children used an overloaded three-wheeled tuk-tuk to return to their home in the hard-hit northern Gaza town of Beit Lahiya. 'Finally we will enjoy our home sweet home again.' The United Nations' said the number of displaced people had decreased significantly. UNRWA, the UN Palestinian refugee agency, said about 53,000 people are still living in shelters, down from almost 290,000 on Tuesday.

"Ted Cruz, the rock-ribbed conservative Texas senator who figures to be a factor in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, told thousands of conservatives Thursday morning that the IRS should go the way of the dodo. 'We need to abolish the IRS,' he said, calling instead for a flat income tax rate and a user-friendly tax return that can be filed on a postcard. That verbal gauntlet, thrown as much at a near-century of tax collection as at the Obama administration, was Cruz's biggest applause line. 'By virtue of your being here today,' he jokingly cautioned the nation's largest annual gathering of politically conservative activists, 'tomorrow each and every one of you is going to be audited by the IRS.' On Wednesday the former IRS official in charge of vetting nonprofit groups that seek tax-exempt charitable status refused, for the second time, to tell a congressional committee what she knew about the scandal.

Lois Lerner claimed the Constitution's Fifth Amendment afforded the right to remain silent, despite a party-line ruling from the House Oversight Committee that she waived that privilege by offering a lengthy opening statement in a May 2013 hearing. More than 200 right-wing organizations, mostly those linked to the tea party movement, sat in limbo for as many as three years while the IRS dithered and held them up during two election cycles. The agency is now moving toward new regulations that would allow it to codify the secret rules it used to screen out conservative organizations while quickly green-lighting liberals. During a Super Bowl Sunday interview with Fox News Channel host Bill O'Reilly, President Barack Obama insisted that there was 'not even a smidgen of corruption' in his administration related to the controversy. Channeling a character in the 1987 cult classic movie The Princess Bride, Cruz mocked the president for his choice of words. 'You keep on using this word,' he said, referring to 'smidgen.' 'I do not think it means what you think it means.' The Conservative Political Action Conference, held near Washington, D.C. in suburban Maryland, will host a cavalcade of right-wing speakers, many of whom are likely to run for president in 2016. In his own back yard: President Barack Obama is under withing attacks as the annual Conservative Political Action Conference gets underway near Washington, D.C. The Conservative Political Action Conference brings together a mishmash of military and foreign policy hawks, evangelical Christians, college Republican activists, campaign strategists and media organizations every year . Cruz seemed to be tightening and road-testing a stump speech himself, advocating for the repeal of the Dodd-Frank banking law, safeguards to buttress the Second Amendment's gun rights, expanding school choice, permanently banning former members of Congress from lobbying their old colleagues, instituting term limits for federal legislators, and auditing the Federal Reserve. That line drew a rousing shout from acolytes of former Texas Rep. Ron Paul, a one-time perennial presidential candidate whose libertarian following has picked up with Paul's son, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, right where it left off. Cruz knows that he must appeal to that subset of the Republican Party, which opposes government surveillance programs as well as centralized control of the U.S. money supply. He asked everyone in the audience with a cell phone to 'please leave them on. I want to make sure President Obama hears everything I have to say.' But the Republican party's more traditional conservatives are his meat and potatoes crowd. Leading off the first day of the CPAC convention, he nearly brought a giant ballroom to its feet with a demand that Congress must 'repeal every single word of Obamacare.' Former IRS official Lois Lerner (L) refused Wednesday to answer questions from Congress about the tea party targeting scandal; Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey (R) said Thursday that Americans 'need to stand up to a president who don't think the laws of America apply to him' Piggybacking on conservative disgust with the Obama administration's steady stream of alterations to the Affordable Care Act's legislated series of deadlines, Cruz took a direct pot-shot at the occupant of the Oval Office. 'If you have a president who is picking and choosing which laws to follow and which laws to ignore, you no longer have a president,' said Cruz. Pennsylvania Sen. Patrick Toomey followed him at the podium with a similar slam. 'We need to stand up to a president who don't think the laws of America apply to him,' Toomey told the crowd. CPAC's attendees are disproportionately young, with College Republicans chapters and church youth groups appearing Thursday morning by the hundreds. 'Millions have lost hope,' Cruz told them, 'because under president Obama, the American dream is harder and harder to achieve. ... If you were to sit down and design a plan to hammer the living daylights out of young people, you couldn't do better than the Obama economic plan.'","Cruz is a Texas senator and likely presidential candidate .
He wants to replace the IRS with a smaller agency that would collect postcard-sized income tax returns based on a flat tax rate .
Cruz also wants to 'repeal every word of Obamacare'
President Obama said on Super Bowl Sunday that there was 'not a smidgen of corruption' in an IRS scandal involving the targeting of tea party groups .
'You keep on using this word,' Cruz retorted, channeling a character from The Princess Bride. 'I do not think it means what you think it means.'"
"BT customer Harvey Nott, who discovered he had been secretly signed up by the firm to make monthly donations to Children in Need . Bungling BT workers secretly signed up a broadband customer to make monthly donations to Children in Need despite never having asked for his permission. Harvey Nott, from Walton-in-Thames in Surrey was shocked to see that when he checked his internet bill, he was signed up to make monthly direct debits to the firm's 'supporters group'. The 45-year-old married sales manager says the bill showed he had already paid three donations to the supporters fund without even realising. Only when he did an online search for the BT supporters fund did he realise the cash was going to the BBC's appeal Children in Need. He then challenged the company, who could have taken donations worth £36 a year from his bank account without permission. Mr Knott said: 'I was never asked whether I wanted to make charity donations through my BT account. 'Their nominated charity is the BBC’s Children in Need. I have nothing against the money-raisers at the BBC but it was shocking not to have even been asked if I wanted to donate. 'I challenged the bill and was told by BT that it would take a week for them to listen to a recording of my phone call at the time I signed off for the broadband package.' When contacted, a spokesman for BT said today that they wished to apologise to Mr Nott and added that they had repaid the charity donation money wrongly taken out of his account. But Mr Nott added: 'I got the impression BT did not really care about their mistake while I was trying to get them to correct the error. However, once the media took up my case, there was instant success. The BBC's appeal which was presented by Sir Terry Wogan and Tess Daly, pictured, was broadcast last week. Mr Nott was unaware he was signed up to donate to the charity . 'It makes you wonder how many other customers are inadvertently paying charity donations without even realising it. When a direct debit arrangement is in place, customers should receive advance notice confirming when payments will be taken and how much they will be – it is advisable to check this to confirm the details are correct. If a direct debit payment has been taken which is not what was agreed – for example, too much has been taken or the payment has been taken on the wrong date - you are entitled to an immediate refund of the amount debited from your bank under the direct debit guarantee. If you cannot get the company - which in this case was BT - to sort out the problem, contact your bank. The guarantee is offered by all banks and building societies that accept instructions to pay direct debits. He now says he will be keeping a close eye on his statements after the mix-up which he claims happened when he renewed his contract. He said: 'As you can imagine, I was most perturbed. I had renegotiated my contract with BT about a month earlier and nothing whatsoever was mentioned about a direct debit. 'Something was very clearly wrong. It was theft from my bank account because they were taking money I haven’t agreed to. 'If I hadn’t noticed that, it would have been £36 a year, which may not seem a lot, but in these times that’s a lot of money for some people. 'I am sure there are many others who are blindly giving away cash because they haven’t noticed. I probably wouldn’t have noticed if I hadn’t been looking at my bill so closely. 'BT was supporting Children in Need at the time but it could be another charity, I don’t know how regularly it rotates, and customers could be giving money to charities they don’t especially wish to support. Mr Nott says BT often rotate the charity they support and at the time he was donating, the cash was going to Children in Need, whose mascot is Pudsey bear, pictured with Sir Terry Wogan . 'People are being left out of pocket by this and it’s not on. BT has a responsibility to make people aware of what they are signing up to. It’s ludicrous.' A spokesman for BT explained: 'BT customer services have removed the donation charge and put a £12 credit on to Mr Nott’s account as an apology. 'Customer services have not been able to speak to Mr Nott but have left a voicemail and emailed him.'","Harvey Nott discovered he had been secretly signed up to make donations .

"Young members of the feared MS-13 gang are believed to be trying to recruit the unaccompanied children they are crossing the U.S. border with. At least 16 of the youngsters being held at an Arizona border processing center have been identified as part of the gang, which has its roots in Central America. The gang members, who admitted to carrying out torture and murder before heading to the U.S., are believed to have also used the center's Red Cross phones to communicate with criminal networks. Notorious: Members of the MS-13 gang, which has links to cartels and a reputation for deadly violence, have been identified at a border center . Spotted: Border staff at Nogales center in Arizona, above, say they identified 16 MS-13 members . Details of alleged gang activity at the Nogales processing center was revealed in a Fox News report, which questioned why known criminals in foreign countries were being allowed into the U.S. Although the gang members are aged from 15 to 17, they admitted to being involved in disturbing acts of violence. An agent, speaking on condition of anonymity, told Townhall: 'We have six minors in Nogales who have admitted to killing and doing grievous bodily injuries. One admitted to killing as young as eight years old. 'They are being held for placement in the U.S,' the agent added. Border patrol has confirmed that MS13 members were identified in the center, and said 13 came from El Salvador, two were from Guatemala, and one traveled from Honduras. The MS-13 gang is notorious for its links to cartels and organized crime, and its ability to access high-powered weapons. Because of unrest in Central America, many of the original gang members had guerrilla warfare experience, making them more deadly than other criminal groups. Gang life: Members of MS-13 often identify themselves with prominent tattoos and sports jerseys bearing numbers that are significant to the group . Signs: The gang members were discovered after graffiti similar to the one pictures in El Salvador, above, was spotted in a bathroom at the immigration center . The members often display their gang affiliation in tattoos, some spread prominently over the face, chest and back. Border agents were allegedly tipped off to the presence of the gang in the processing center after graffiti was spotted in the boys' bathroom. Because the gang members are under the age of 18, the U.S. is unable to lawfully return them to their home countries. A recent surge in the number of unaccompanied minors crossing the border has also made it is difficult for staff at the center to separate suspected gang members from the vulnerable children. 'They’re . trying to recruit other teenage boys that are sharing cells with them . and they’re using the phones that the Red Cross has set up,' Katie Pavlich, of Fox News, said. 'They’re . supposed to be using those to call back home or to call family members . in the United States. They’re also using those as a way to communicate . with gang members already in U.S. cities.' Rules: Because the gang members are under 18, under U.S. law border agents are unable to remove them from the Arizona center, above . A border agent had raised fears about gangs last month, saying: 'If he’s a confirmed gang member in his own country, why are we letting him in here?' Officials running the border centers, which are overwhelmed with immigrants, said there was little they could do to tackle the gang problem. 'Agents' hands are tied due to the policies governing the care and lodging of juveniles and this has allowed gang recruitment and activity to flourish amongst those being detained,' National Border Patrol Council's vice-chairman Shawn Moran told Townhall. Homeland Security has been informed of the 16 known MS-13 gang members in the youth facility.","Gang members spotted after graffiti bearing their symbols was left in border center bathroom .

"His entrepreneurial spirit is undeniable. Inspired by TV show Dragons’ Den, Tommie Rose targeted a gap in the market at his school – selling crisps and fizzy drinks, which are banned under a ‘healthy eating’ policy. His smuggled snacks are so popular that he claims to have earned £14,000 in just three years, and even employs two other pupils. Tommie, 15, says he is saving the cash to pay for tuition fees if he fulfils his dream of winning a place to study business at Oxford or Cambridge. Business prowess: Tommie Rose, 15, has managed to earn a staggering £14,000 by selling chocolate, sweets and fizzy drinks in the playground of his school in Salford, Greater Manchester . However, he has fallen foul of teachers, who have threatened to suspend him for undermining school policies aimed at combating obesity. Yesterday their stance was slammed by entrepreneurs including Dragons’ Den star Deborah Meaden, who wrote online: ‘[Tommie] doesn’t need a degree in business ... He’s a natural.’ The teenager, who is in Year Ten at Buile Hill Visual Arts College in Salford, Greater Manchester, said yesterday: ‘I got the idea from watching Dragons’ Den and feeling I could do something like that.’ He operated a similar undercover tuck shop at his previous school, Oasis Academy, but was repeatedly suspended and eventually expelled. Buile Hill headmaster James Inman said: ‘We admire this pupil’s entrepreneurship but school is not the place to set up a black market.’ Tommie’s father Gary, a 33-year-old office worker, said: ‘From our point of view, he’s not selling cigarettes, alcohol or drugs ... he’s selling sweets, which teenagers are always going to consume no matter where they buy them from.’ However, a school source said Tommie was disruptive at school and well short of being Oxbridge material. ‘He was taken on from his previous school in good faith on the understanding that he wouldn’t set up another miniature tuck shop,’ they added. Warning: James Inman, headmaster at Buile Hill Visual Arts College, above, has told Tommie that he will be suspended unless he shuts down his playground business . Aspirations: The entrepreneurial teenager has been saving thousands in a trust fund in the hope of paying for a business degree from Oxford or Cambridge . Previous school: Tommie left Oasis Academy, in Salford, above, in 2011 after they suspended him for ten days over his playground sweet business . While business owners are required to register their companies  - the HMRC suggested it was extremely unlikely Tommie would be pursued for failing to do so. A spokesman said: 'There are penalties for failure to notify where someone has started a business and not let us know. 'But we would never penalise a young entrepreneur for his industry and imagination in starting a business from scratch, off his own back.'","Tommie Rose, of Salford, buys sweet stock in bulk from discount stores .

"Independence could leave Scots facing higher mobile phone bills if they use their phone south of the border, the UK Government will claim. Ministers are to publish the latest in a series of papers examining the impact of a Yes vote in next year's independence referendum. The paper will suggest independence could impact on mail services and costs, and could make programmes to roll out high speed broadband across the country more expensive. Scots may also have to pay international roaming charges if they make a mobile phone call south of the border . People close to the border could also incur extra charges if their mobile phone is connected to a mast on the other side of the border . It says mobile phone users may have to pay international roaming charges if they make a call in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. It also warns that people close to the border could inadvertently incur these charges if their mobile phone connected to a mast on the other side of the border. UK Consumer Minister Jo Swinson said: . 'The UK's integrated infrastructure connects people and communities, . creates jobs and supports trade. 'The Government is committed to . maintaining world class postal and broadband services. 'This includes . continuation of a six-day-a-week postal delivery service and the . provision of broadband to rural areas. 'The rural broadband programme . will deliver investment of £100.8million to Scottish communities that . depend on getting connected. 'If Scotland left the UK, posting a letter or making a call could cost more - and there could be less choice for customers.' The UK Government believes that by being in Britain Scotland benefits from 'world class services and economies of scale' that support the postal service, with its uniform pricing all over the UK, and investment in broadband. The Tory-Liberal Democrat coalition has allocated £530million over the spending review period for its rural broadband programme, designed to help roll out high speed internet services to more remote communities. Scotland is to receive just over £100million of this, with the UK Government saying the country 'benefits disproportionately' compared to its share of the population. But it warns that independence would mean Scotland would no longer benefit from this, adding this would 'inevitably' drive up the cost of delivering broadband in such areas. The UK Government also argues that if Scotland left the UK it could impact on the cost of sending letters and parcels between the two countries. At the moment, it says economies of scale across Britain help support six day a week postal deliveries, with customers paying one price to post something, regardless of where they are. The cost of posting letters and parcels could rise in an independent Scotland, the Government has warned . Communities Minister Jo Swinson said there may be less choice for consumers in an independent Scotland . This is part of the Royal Mail's universal service, with the UK Government saying the supporters of independence should set out if these levels of service would be maintained following a Yes vote. The Scottish Government said successive Westminster governments had 'substantially weakened' Scotland's communications infrastructure. A spokeswoman said: 'Since 2002, more than 400 Scottish Post Offices have closed and plans for privatisation of Royal Mail threatens jobs and the operation of the universal service obligation whilst people across rural Scotland regularly struggle with the lack of mobile phone coverage as the current system fails to deliver for Scotland. 'Independence will provide an opportunity to properly support the postal network with access to our fair share of UK assets, and as the Federation of Post Masters have recognised, the Scottish Government has an excellent record of supporting rural post offices. 'Both the Royal Mail and the Federation of Post Masters are clear that there need be no disruption to services and that independence could offer real opportunities for the network. 'Similarly the UK's claims fail to recognise key changes in the telecoms market. Currently, the fragmentation of mobile and broadband initiatives, and the reserved nature of telecoms policy and regulation, prevents us from realising the economic benefits that could be achieved through improving digital connectivity - something highlighted in our proposals for future regulation published in February. 'However the UK Government should acknowledge that the EU is looking to remove roaming charges completely and they are widely expected to be abolished well before 2016. 'Independence could ensure that the regulatory and policy regimes are better aligned to achieve this.'","Scots face international roaming charges if they call in England or Wales .

"The spirit of Christmas is thriving in one part of Britain after an act of kindness to a family snowballed with others rushing to follow suit. Karl Bennett caused a giveaway stampede after posting an offer of a week's free holiday to a lucky family in his caravan in Kingsbridge, Devon to a Facebook group. He posted to the 'Free stuff in Plymouth' page offering a getaway in spring as a Christmas present. Karl Bennett started the frenzy by offering a free week's holiday in his luxury caravan near Plymouth . Since then, a large group of people have offered other gifts and services including this attractive cake . One family has offered these baby toys which will be sure to bring some job on Christmas morning . Danna Kemp, who has two autistic sons aged 10 and 12 and a daughter aged 20, said that she contacted Mr Bennett about the caravan holiday. She said: ''Karl is away at the moment but I sent him a private message when he offered the holiday to ask him what dates he had available and costs as I have two autistic sons and thought it would be good as if it's too much for them, we could come home. The 42-year-old mother of three said the holiday was especially welcome as her husband is awaiting brain surgery. She added: 'I was stunned and cried when I read his reply. 'He told me I could have 10 days in April for free to just have fun.' Since then the Facebook page has been inundated with offers of free Christmas gifts including a gym membership, hair cuts, a photo session with a professional photographer, a pony ride and even a cooked Christmas dinner. Since Mr Bennett's generous offer, there have been a wide range of other gifts offered by the Facebook users . Caprice Vogler has run the group in Plymouth for the past two years and is stunned by the response . Capricia Vogler, who was an administrator of the group for almost two years, said that people have been giving away their unwanted items on the page for years. She said: 'It's absolutely amazing. Ms Vogler, 32, from Devonport, Plymouth, said: 'As soon as Karl posted up his gift everyone started to get into the spirit of things because it was such a big gift. 'Even people who haven't got much have gone out their way to give things away. 'This is the first time it's happened for Christmas and it's gone completely mental.' The group has almost 9,000 members and scores of individuals and businesses have come together to generously donate gifts in the Christmas spirit. Vicky Nicholls, who is also a member of the group, said that she noticed Mr Bennett's post a while ago but that the offers really started flooding through over the past couple of days. Several items of jewellery such as this bracelet, left and watch set, right, are being donated for Christmas . The 30-year-old beauty therapist said: ''I noticed the first post about a week ago but what's happened in the last 24 hours has really snowballed. 'It's quite endearing to see it at this time of year when everyone's struggling and is a bit negative. 'It's just all about providing for your family and one act of kindness has encouraged people to do the same.'

"The BBC has been accused of 'extraordinary' censorship by a leading playwright after dialogue was cut from her hard-hitting drama in case it offended Muslims. Gurpreet Kaur Bhatti, whose 2004 play Behzti was pulled from a Birmingham theatre after it sparked Sikh protests, says the Corporation tampered with her work because it involved an honour killing. Ms Bhatti was commissioned by Radio 4 to write an episode of its police drama Stone. Her episode, The Heart of Darkness, will be broadcast this Friday, but she says the BBC has caused an 'awful situation' which has led to a 'betrayal' of her work. Controversial: Her episode of DCI Stone, starring Hugo Speer, is on Radio 4 on Friday but is missing key lines, she says, because of 'fear' At the centre of her story is the honour killing of a 16-year-old . Asian girl, and DCI Stone is told by his bosses to treat the case 'sensitively' because she is Muslim. Although they have admitted removing dialogue from the afternoon drama, the BBC claims they did it to avoid 'potentially misrepresenting majority British Muslim attitudes to honour killing'. Describing the play's final line, Ms Bhatti told a conference called Taking the Offensive, organised by Index on Censorship: 'At the end, a . character says: ""There is so much pressure in our community to look right . and to behave right."" The compliance department came back and said, ""We . don’t want to suggest the entire Muslim community condones honour killings"". 'It's a crucial part of that story. I was very disappointed given my previous experience of censorship. If you take out the line, the whole thing changes, it's a betrayal of the character and the truth of the unfolding story. 'It’s an extraordinary and awful situation. They said the . lines were offensive but they absolutely were not. We live in a fear-ridden . culture.' Bhatti, who also writes The Archers, was forced into hiding in 2004 after her play Behzti caused a storm. It included a scene in a Gurdwara, a Sikh temple, which involved rape, physical abuse and murder. But the play did win her awards. That year she received death threats, including a Christmas card that read: 'Seasons Greetings. This will be your last Christmas. You are a disgrace to the race. Sending you lots of hate.' Row: A sign outside the Birmingham Rep Theatre in 2004 after the cancellation of the play Behzti because it sparked protests and led to its author getting death threats . The BBC said today the radio drama to be played on Friday was treated no differently than any other. 'This is a hard-hitting drama about . the realities of honour killing in Britain. A single line in the script . could be taken to infer that the pressure and motivation to commit such a . crime in a family comes from the wider Muslim community, potentially . misrepresenting majority British Muslim attitudes to honour killing,' a Radio 4 spokesman said.

"It might be the height of fashion but the recent trend for bushy beards has caused a problem for the food industry because of its strict hygiene rules. But hipsters don't need to worry about shaving off their facial hair for a career in catering - instead they can just wear a beard net. Sales of the snoods are rocketing thanks to bearded men working in the preparation or packaging of food snapping them up. Solution: The trend for beards had been causing a problem for those working in the food industry but they don't need to worry if they wear a beard net . No need to shave: The beard snoods mean catering workers still adhere to strict hygiene rules . A firm that makes the beard snoods has reported an increase in orders of around a third over the past three years. The current trend for beards in the UK is said to have stemmed from the 'Hipster' subculture of New York, characterised by a bushy beard, shaven hair at the side, and tattoos. The look has gone global thanks to bearded models like Ben Dahlhaus representing designer brands while high street chains like New Look and John Lewis have used fuzzy-faced men in their advertising campaigns this year. As a result, earlier this year it was reported sales of razor blades have suffered while the million pound beard snood industry has reaped the rewards. Lion Haircare & Disposables have invested in more staff and equipment to keep up with demand as the craze for breads has taken a hold in the UK and beyond. Increase in sales: Nottingham-based Lion Haircare & Disposables have invested in more staff and equipment to keep up with demand for the nets . The company, based in Nottingham, supply the snoods globally and have introduced a new range which include built-in antibacterial agents. Adrian Wright, chief operating officer at Lion Haircare & Disposables, said: 'The last three years has seen a 32 per cent increase in beard snood volumes. This is a significant rise and we now sell well over three million snoods annually.' 'The rise in demand seems to be coming from a combination of factors. Trends towards more facial hair, whether that is full beard or the stubble look and increasing quality assurance demands during food preparation. The two aspects go hand in hand.' Safe: The snoods meet hygiene requirements and have built-in antibacterial agents . He said the beard snoods have has to 'evolve' to 'meet the hygiene requirements of the latest facial hair fashions'. Mr Wright continued: 'This year our organisation modified its beard snood and hairnet products to include built-in antibacterial agents that inhibit microbial growth. 'It's not something people necessarily want to think about, but germs are a consideration where hair is present. Even moderate stubble brings additional risks of touching and scratching.' Barbers are also benefiting from the hipster trend. Hipster craze: Barbers are also benefiting from the trend for beards . In fashion: New Look, left, and John Lewis have used bearded models in advertising campaigns this year . Laura Howlett, manager at the Ruffians Barbers in Edinburgh, said: 'For the last 18 months the trend has been really big. 'At least 60-65 per cent of our customers have beards. It's quite a lot.' She added: 'People have always has stubble but guy of all ages, not just students, have decided they are going to grow beards.'","Firm that makes beard snoods has reported an increase in orders .

"Big prize: Corey Knowlton is believed to be the man who paid $350,000 for the license to shoot a black rhino . A hunter has paid $350,000 at a Dallas auction on Saturday to hunt a black rhino, one of the most endangered animals on the planet. The 'license to kill' was sold by the Dallas Safari Club in conjunction with the Namibian government, as a minister from the African country was said to be jumping up and down in elation at the result because the funds go to conservation efforts in the country. The identity of the buyer has not been officially confirmed but another hunter has named  Corey Knowlton as the suspected winner. 'Well, I was willing to go $340,000 for the black rhino, but Corey Knowlton went $350,000 and won the bid! Plus there was another $100,000 donation!! DSC and their supporters came through in a huge way for conservation again tonight!!' hunter Wes Mundy posted on Facebook. Calls to the Dallas Safari Club were not immediately returned. Mr . Knowlton is an active hunter who arranges shooting trips around the . globe, and regularly posts updates of pictures on his Facebook profile . of himself with clients and the dead animals that they kill. The . hacktivist group Anonymous has now become involved in the debate and . launched a virtual attack- which they have named as OpFunKill- on . hunters involved with the auction. 'Unspeakable . and terrible things happen every second of every day while the whole . planet is forced to watch, as these cold hearted soulless zombies cause . horrific suffering and death to animals, both common, vulnerable and . critically endangered species,' they said in a manifesto. Mr . Knowlton, a married father of two young daughters, is a part of the . Hunting Consortium and his company biography boasts that he has worked . in the hunting tourism industry for more than a decade. Endangered: An estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in the 1960s . 'Corey Knowlton has hunted widely on 6 continents taking more than 120 species, including a Super Slam of wild sheep and the big five in Africa.' it states. He lists conservation as one of his major interests, which stays in line with the Dallas Safari Club's claims that the sale of the license helps protect the endangered species by focusing on the killing of specific, older and arguably more aggressive beasts. The animal that is listed as the target involved with this weekend's sale is Ronnie, an older bull rhino who can no longer breed. Club spokesman Steve Wagner told The Dallas Morning News that the animal was likely becoming a threat to other wildlife as he is getting more aggressive in his old age. Happy hunters: Knowlton (right) has been leading tourist hunting trips for over a decade . An . estimated 4,000 black rhinos remain in the wild, down from 70,000 in . the 1960s. Nearly 1,800 are in Namibia, according to the safari club. The Dallas Safari Club sale, which has been condemned by environmental groups, was offering the chance to shoot the rare beast as a way to raise funds for the species' conservation. While there were protesters at the event and animal rights groups have regularly spoken out against the sales of hunting licenses, the organizers were more upset that they didn't raise more money- as they were originally hoping to reach the million-dollar mark. 'It annoys me to tears,' said Hanns-Louis Lamprecht, who runs a safari company in Namibia. 'I was so angry last night. A million dollars would have lasted years, years in the conservation efforts...The fact is it could have been more — it could have been a lot more,' he told The Dallas Morning News. The Dallas Safari Club hopes to raise money in order to conserve the rhino in Nambia . A beautiful series of giraffe art is on view and available for sale at the Dallas Safari Club expo in Dallas . After complaints and protests about the . sale, the FBI said earlier this week that it was investigating death . threats against members of the club. About 40 protesters held signs and chanted outside the convention center where the . auction and dinner took place. Jim . and Lauren Ries traveled from Atlanta to join the protest after their . children Carter, 12, and Olivia, 11, asked if they could campaign. 'We heard what the . Dallas Safari Club was doing and we thought it was just wrong that they . were auctioning off to kill a black rhino and we really got upset that . they were thinking this,' Carter said. The family run a nonprofit organization, One More Generation, which is dedicated to saving endangered species. The Dallas Safari Club has adopted a new definition of the ideal hunt-able male African lion as well as the rhino . 'There's less than 5,000 black rhinos . left on the planet and if our kids ever want to see . a rhino left in the wild, we can't be pulling the trigger on every one . we say is too old to breed,' Mr Ries said. Ben . Carter, executive director of the Safari Club, defended the auction. He . said all money raised will go toward rhino conservation efforts. He also said the rhino that the . winner will hunt is old, male and non breeding — and that the animal was . likely to be targeted for removal anyway because it was becoming . aggressive and threatening other wildlife. Mr Carter added that wildlife experts say culling a herd is an acceptable habitat management practice. 'In most cases, this animal is detrimental,' Mr Carter said. 'He's past his prime.' But . critics have questioned that logic. Officials from the Humane Society . and the International Fund for Animal Welfare have said that while . culling can be appropriate in abundant animal populations, all black . rhinos should be protected, given their endangered status. Critics have also said any hunting of a rhino sends a bad message to the public. This . auction is telling the world that an American will pay anything to kill . their species,' Jeffrey Flocken, North American regional director of . the Massachusetts-based IFAW, said earlier this week. 'This is, in fact, making a spectacle of killing an endangered species.'","Dallas Safari Club has sold a permit to kill old endangered black rhino .

"Plans by Labour to charge visitors from the US and 55 other countries who don't require a visa to enter the UK have been met with dismay by airlines. Under the proposals, nationals in countries enjoying a 'visa waiver' system of fast-track permission to enter the UK will be hit with a charge of around £10 per visit, which the party said would more than cover the £45 million cost of 1,000 extra border guards. That is a similar sum as the US charges for its equivalent service and Labour said tourism experts did not anticipate it would have any impact on the numbers choosing to travel to Britain. Under Labour's plans, passengers who don't require a visa to enter the UK could be met with a £10 entry fee (File Photo) But Nathan Stower, chief executive of the British Air Transport Association (BATA), voiced serious concerns over the proposals. 'While we welcome the desire to improve the customer experience for passengers arriving at the UK border, airlines have significant concerns about this proposal,' he said . 'Visitors from countries like the USA and Australia already pay the highest air passenger tax in the world to fly to the UK – £71 from next April – contributing billions of pounds to the Treasury. Adding yet another charge will make the UK more uncompetitive in attracting tourists, businesses and inbound investment. 'It is not clear how this proposed charge would be collected. The vast majority of visitors from those countries that are not required to obtain a visa to enter the UK, such as the USA, do not currently provide information to UK authorities ahead of their visit. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper believes changes need to be made on the UK's immigration policy . It might not just be your passport you need to show to enter the UK, but also an extra £10 . 'Furthermore, if more money were to be raised from airline passengers alone, it would only fair for this to fund improvements in the border at airports and not at other ports of entry such as Calais.' Regular increases in the cost of general visas since 2010 - from £68 to £83 - had not resulted in reduced visitor numbers from countries not benefiting from waiver arrangements, aides said. Shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper announced the plan as part of a wider program of wider reforms she believe needs to be introduced to the UK's policy on immigration. As many as 5.5 million travellers a year will be subject to the new fee - more than two in five of those from America, with Australians and Canadians the next largest groups.","Visitors who benefit from a 'visa waiver' could be charged £10 entry fee .

"Beautiful and brutal in equal parts is the Perito Moreno Glacier in Patagonia's Unesco World Heritage-listed Los Glaciares National Park. The stunning expanse of ice on Lake Argentina covers about 97 square miles, the equivalent of 35,000 football pitches, but is constantly growing and ruptures every year. The 19 mile-long glacier is just 48 miles from the lakeside city of El Calafate and is becoming an increasingly popular tourist attraction, with day trips offered by a number of tour companies. The Perito Moreno Glacier in Los Glaciares National Park in Argentina covers the equivalent of 35,000 football pitches . The sharp edge of the 97 square mile glacier on Lake Argentina, which is constantly growing . The reason behind the glacier's growth is not known but as it advances into the lake it dams a section and causes the water level to rise. Water builds up pressure and eventually ruptures causing large chunks of ice to break from the glacier and water to pour from the dammed section to the main body of the lake. This natural phenomenon occurs as often as once a year. But in between the spectacular ruptures large chunks of ice breaks off from the vast growing mass. These incredible photographs were taken by Polish photographer Jakub Polomski. As well as capturing its sheer magnitude, he also saw a large chunk of ice falling from the glacier and splashing into Lake Argentina. A large chunk of ice from the edge of the Perito Moreno Glacier falls into the water and makes a wave . The Perito Moreno Glacier can be found in Patagonia's UNESCO World Heritage-listed Los Glaciares National Park . Jakub said: 'I was there for the second time in my life, and I was lucky with the weather. It was changing rapidly. The sun was coming out and it was getting warmer quickly. 'I had a feeling that some big part would fall into the water - and it happened. I was there only for about an hour and a really huge piece fell.' Guided treks can be taken on the ice itself ranging from one to five hours - or if going on the glacier is too ominous, visitors can negotiate a walking circuit from the visitor centre to see the spectacular southern and eastern edges. The sheer scale of the natural marvel is imposing with the ice rising almost 250 feet above the surface of the water. The glacier is currently in the midst of a relatively stable period with the most recent of its ruptures taking place in January last year - it busts open, on average, every four or five years but sometimes the gap can be as little as two years. While its terrain appears brutal, hiking tours between one and five hours-long are available on the ice . The dense mass of ice in Patagonia rises more than 70m from the surface of the water . The glacier ruptures on average every four to five years, with its last major event happening in January 2013 .","Perito Moreno Glacier can be found in Los Glaciares National Park, which is Unesco World Heritage-listed .

"IBM and Boston authorities tested a new facial recognition software that secretly scanned every person who attended two major music festivals in Boston - all without their knowledge or consent, according to a Boston newspaper. The massive surveillance system, run by the company's Intelligence Operations Center, aimed cameras on thousands of people at Boston Calling, a massive  concert series near City Hall, in May and September 2013. The first test run took place a month after  bombings that killed three people and injured dozens more near the finish line of the Boston Marathon. According to the newspaper Dig Boston,  Boston police officers were on hand to witness the test of the surveillance system - though IBM staffers were running the operation. These images, purportedly taken from an IBM report on surveillance operations at the Boston Calling music festival, show how people were scanned at the event . Dig Boston reports that the program scanned to determine 'skin tone,' 'head color' and clothing texture of attendees, with the goal of running everyone at the event through the software . The example of surveillance camera footage shows how the IBM software was able to flag all black women wearing glasses and yellow shirts who went through mass transit turnstiles. It is not clear whether this was part of the Boston Calling surveillance activity . Dig Boston claims that the test sought to track 'every person' at the musical festival with ten surveillance cameras that had been set up around the event. The newspaper says it uncovered documents detailing the use of IBM's Face Capture software, which identifies 'baldness,' 'head color,' 'skin tone' and clothing. IBM says Face Capture was not used at the event. IBM spokeswoman Holli Haswell told MailOnline: 'IBM shared a one-time proof of concept and demo with the City of Boston on situational analytics. In the demo, IBM provided broad analytics for several use cases such as identifying suspicious objects like an abandoned bag or vehicle, or to provide an alert when someone crosses from an unrestricted area to a restricted area. 'The software did not provide facial recognition on attendees at Boston Calling.' Earlier this month, Dig Boston found an IBM report detailing the operation that had been available online for more than a year. A spokeswoman for the mayor's office acknowledged that Boston officials had authorized the test - though later scrapped the project. Both the mayor's office and the police say they do not currently operate surveillance technology like IBM tested at Boston Calling. 'The City of Boston engaged in a pilot program with IBM, testing situational awareness software for two events hosted on City Hall Plaza: Boston Calling in May 2013, and Boston Calling in September 2013,' Kate Norton, the spokeswoman for Boston Mayor Marty Walsh, told Dig Boston. 'The purpose of the pilot was to evaluate software that could make it easier for the City to host large, public events, looking at challenges such as permitting, basic services, crowd and traffic management, public safety, and citizen engagement through social media and other channels. 'These were technology demonstrations utilizing pre-existing hardware (cameras) and data storage systems.' IBM did not respond to a request for comment. Although IBM scanned thousands of people during the test, there's no indication that the company tried to put names to the faces it collected. Boston Police spokesman Sergeant Michael McCarthy told MailOnline that the company did not have access to Boston police booking photos or driver license pictures.","IBM ran a test of its Intelligence Operations Center that took over ten cameras at Boston Calling festival in May and September 2013 .

"Sweden's largest toy chain has been forced to become ‘gender neutral’ by picturing boys holding baby dolls and girls brandishing toy guns in the pages of its Christmas catalogue. Top Toy - which holds the franchise for Toys R Us - made the move after being reprimanded by the country’s advertising watchdog for ‘gender discrimination’ in a previous catalogue, which featured boys dressed as superheroes and girls playing princess. A comparison between this year’s Toys R Us catalogues in Sweden and Denmark, where Top Toy is also the franchisee, showed that a boy wielding a toy machine gun in the Danish edition had been replaced by a girl in Sweden.

"Lance Winder was crushed to death by a digger when it tipped over and fell on his head . A builder was crushed to death by a digger in a freak accident when  the machine tipped over and fell on his head. Lance Winder was renovating his bungalow when the digger he hired for the day tipped over and pinned him to the ground, an inquest heard. His friend and fellow labourer found the 48-year-old unconscious in the back garden and immediately thought Mr Winder 'looked like he was dead'. Mr Winder was crushed underneath the machine and had been knocked out by its metal safety bar. Paramedics arrived at the building site in Marlow Bottom, Buckinghamshire, shortly after the accident on September 17 but the builder was declared dead at the scene. Michael Papamichael told the inquest at Beaconsfield Coroner's Court that he had offered to help his friend out with the work as he was unemployed at the time. Mr Papamichael was breaking slabs at the front of the property when tragedy struck. When he went round to the back garden he saw the digger was tipped on its side with Mr Winder trapped beneath it. 'A metal bar was on the side of his head,' Mr Papamichael said. 'It immediately looked like he was dead. 'The digger was completely still. There was no sound and the tracks were still.' He said his friend was not wearing a hard hat or a seatbelt. 'I can't remember seeing anything that could have tipped the digger over,' he added. Health and Safety Executive officer John Berezansky said no defects were found in the mini-excavator machine that could have contributed to Mr Winder's death. He said marks had been found on the back wall which were 'consistent with the machine coming backwards and rolling onto its side'. The vehicle's centre of gravity was quite far back, meaning it could tip over in this way, Mr Berezansky said. It was not clear whether Mr Winder had tried to jump clear of the digger or been thrown from it before being pinned down by the roll bar - a protective device. Mr Berezansky said: 'There are two scenarios and it is impossible to say. 'It can be tempting. You think you can jump clear. But you're probably safer if you stay in the vehicle rather than trying to escape.' The yellow digger which crushed Mr Winder was estimated to weigh more than a tonne. Mr Winder's friend Michael Papamichael was in the front garden of the property (pictured) in Marlow Bottom, Buckinghamshire, when tragedy struck, finding him crushed under the machine at the back of the bungalow . Mr Winder was killed 'almost instantaneously' in the tragic accident, the inquest at Beaconsfield Coroner's Court (pictured) heard . A post-mortem examination showed Mr Winder had died from severe head injuries. His death would have been 'virtually instantaneous,' pathologist Dr Peter Johnson told the hearing. Mr Winder was renovating his family home and was living with his partner, Christina Cajal, in a temporary caravan on the site. His father David said his son had been hoping to marry Christina and was settling down after a lifetime of travelling, which had seen him go around the world twice. Senior coroner Richard Hulett said: 'I can see from these photographs, it is quite an achievement for it [the digger] to end up like this. 'By some means or other it's toppled over and crushed him.' Mr Hulett said it was 'impossible to disentangle' if Mr Winder had undone his seatbelt to jump out or if he had simply not been wearing one and been thrown out of the digger. Recording a verdict of accidental death, he said: 'It was something completely unintentional and it has cost him his life.' Speaking after the inquest, Mr Winder's father said: 'His passports showed he'd been to 52 countries. He'd been there, done it and got the t-shirt. 'You never expect your son to go before you, so it's been difficult. It was just a tragic accident.'","Lance Winder was crushed to death by a digger while renovating his home .

"Jailed: Connor Dawes followed the young man into a darkened alleyway where he knocked him to the ground and stole his phone and wallet . A teenage mugger who handed himself into police after realising that his victim had Asperger's syndrome told officers that he was 'scum'. Connor Dawes followed the vulnerable young man into a darkened alleyway where he knocked him to the ground and stole his phone and wallet. But when Dawes rifled through the wallet, he found details on his victim's condition and turned himself into police. The 19-year-old told the officers that he felt 'very bad' for kicking his victim and described himself as 'scum'. He was jailed for two years at Warwick Crown Court after he admitted to robbery. The court heard Dawes, from Nottingham, was in Nuneaton, Warwickshire, with a friend when the pair spotted the victim walking through the town centre alone at around 10pm. He was caught on CCTV following the young man  for about five minutes before approaching the man in the alleyway. There, he knocked him to the ground and pulled off his coat before snatching his phone and wallet. The victim suffered a cut to his eye and as a result of the robbery. He now feels scared and vulnerable and is terrified of seeing his attackers in the street, the court heard. Dawes gave evidence at Nuneaton Youth Court against another alleged robber, but that youth was found not guilty. Tom Schofield, defending, said: 'The first significant mitigation is his early guilty plea. He describes himself as 'scum' to the author of the pre-sentence report, reflecting his genuine shame at what he had done. 'And he handed himself in to the police, although he had then moved out of the area, and made full admissions.' Mr Schofield said Dawes heard the police were making inquiries at the homes of friends in Nuneaton, so handed himself in. Judge Sylvia de Bertodano told Dawes: 'A young man who suffers from Asperger's syndrome was walking through Nuneaton, and you and another young man started to follow him, clearly with the intention of taking the opportunity to rob him. 'You may not have known this young man had Asperger's, but you certainly knew he was vulnerable because he was on his own at night, and there were two of you and only one of him. Dawes was jailed for two years at Warwick Crown Court (pictured) after he pleaded guilty to robbery . 'This is a young man who struggles in life, and he has described in moving terms how much worse that struggle has become as a result of this. 'It is a great shame you come before the court for such a serious offence. It is clear that this was out of character.' The judge added: 'I have two boys to consider; not just you but the boy you attacked and robbed. The message has to go out that people who do that go to prison.'","Connor Dawes was caught on CCTV following his victim into an alleyway .

"Mimi Valdez and niece Chrissy went to Hospital Jerusalem for cosmetic surgery and now say they are left disfigured and regretting the decision . Two Texas women who travelled to Mexico to undergo plastic surgery are now warning others not to make the same decision they did. Mimi Valdez and her niece Chrissy decided to save money by outsourcing their medical procedures to a facility in Tijuana. But after what they say were gruesome and life-threatening results at Hospital Jerusalem, the two women say they wish they’d just saved their money and had the work done at home. Scroll down for video... Regretful: Mimi Valdez had lost 130 pounds and wanted to get a tummy tuck to remove leftover skin. She chose to have surgery at a Tijuana, Mexico hospital and says she regrets the decision . Valdez chose to go to Hospital Jerusalem for two reasons: First, after losing 130 pounds, she said she wanted the remaining loose skin removed via a tummy tuck. And second, the hospital told Valdez she’d be charged just $5,000 in total. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, that’s about the average cost for the surgery in the United States, but does not include costly anesthesia, operating facilities, or other expenses. After her dramatic weight loss, she was ready to see the full effect of all her efforts. ‘You’re tired. It’s heavy, it’s loose skin and it’s just hard to live like that,’ Valdez told KHOU. It seemed like the perfect solution, until the women made it to Tijuana. 'I made a very, very wrong decision to go through with it': Valdez and her niece say the Hospital Jerusalem was actually a clinic in a strip mall when they arrived there . Post-surgery: Valdez underwent a tummy tuck and her niece had surgery on her breasts. 'I had skin hanging out of the incisions,' Chrissy said. They said the Hospital Jerusalem, pristine and welcoming on their website, was more like a clinic in a strip mall. Despite reservations, Mimi and Chrissy decided to go through with it. ‘I was already there,’ Chrissy told the Houston CBS affiliate. ‘I knew I wasn’t going to get my money back and I made a very, very wrong decision to go through with it. And I should have listened to my intuition but I didn’t.’ Nightmare: Chrissy and her aunt Mimi say they are now both disfigured from their surgery . Prior to their surgeries, Valdez taped a testimonial at the clinic. She beamed into the camera, ‘I’m very excited!’ But that excitement quickly turned to fear for both women. ‘Immediately after the bandages were removed,’ Chrissy said, ‘I took a look in the mirror at my breasts, I had skin hanging out of the incisions.’ Her aunt was in bad shape as well. 'I'm very excited': Valdez seems thrilled in a testimonial she taped before the surgery in Tijuana. Now, she asks, 'Why did I do this?' ‘When I went to the hospital, they said we don’t know if we can save her,’ Valdez told KHOU. Thankfully, both women survived the ordeal. However, they both now complain of disfigurement and say Hospital Tijuana won’t even acknowledge they were ever patients. A hospital spokesperson invoked the Patients’ Privacy Act and declined to comment. Unfortunately, stateside experts in the world of surgery abroad say these women’s story comes as no big surprise. 'We answer to higher calling': The Hospital Jerusalem site promises life-hanging results from bariatric and other surgeries but advice group Patients Without Borders says to be very choosy about overseas surgeries . ‘Patients who travel for medical care can greatly increase their chances of successful outcomes by placing quality over cost-savings,’ wrote the group Patients Beyond Borders on Facebook in response to the KHOU story. The group also suggests ‘carefully vetting the hospital or clinic for accreditation and other quality indicators, and checking doctor's credentials.’ Left with no legal recourse, the women said they just want others to be more cautious than they were. ‘Many times I said “Why did I do this?” I should have saved enough money and had it done with a doctor in Texas,’ Valdez said.",Mimi Valdez and niece Chrissy went to Hospital Jerusalem for cosmetic surgery and now say they are left disfigured and regretting the decision .

'I thought it was a great family photo, nothing at all wrong with it!', another commented. Several of Uhlich followers pointed to the recent 'Break the Internet' photo shoot featuring Kim Kardashian which appeared uncensored on the site. 'They've removed baby photos of me. Yet Kim Kardashian's photos are all over my newsfeed. It's so ridiculous,' said one user. Another was more satirical, and said the photo was removed because 'you didn't balance a champagne glass on your bum.' Facebook's nudity policy states that the site  has a 'strict policy against the sharing of pornographic content and any explicitly sexual content where a minor is involved,' 'We also impose limitations on the display of nudity. We aspire to respect people’s right to share content of personal importance, whether those are photos of a sculpture like Michelangelo's David or family photos of a child breastfeeding.' Some on the site raised this point, calling the photo 'beautiful', 'gorgeous,' 'lovely,' and labelling it a 'great family photo.'

Don't give up!' One user pointed out that she had been advised not to post pictures of the children she nannied as paedophiles targeted social media sites looking for nudity, and said that before it had been pointed out the thought had not even occurred to her. 'It's sad that that's the world we live in. Maybe Facebook are attempting to protect your gorgeous girls in this instance?' she asked. Before 2014, photographs of mothers breastfeeding were banned from the site under their nudity policy, which was reversed after a feminist writer from Women, Action, and the Media launched a campaign against what she saw as 'gender-based hate speech'. After receiving 60,000 tweets and 5,000 emails in support of the movement, Facebook answered the call to refine it's approach to the broader issue and included breastfeeding as allowable content, while still deeming other exposure of women's nipple inappropriate. In a response from the site last year, Facebook said that they continually 'work hard to make our platform a safe and respectful place for sharing and connection. This requires us to make difficult decisions and balance concerns about free expression and community respect.'","Australian model Rhys Uhlich posted a photo to Facebook showing his partner and two daughters with him in the bath with the caption 'nothing like a family scrub'

"A great white shark was pictured creeping up on a pair of surfers in Manhattan Beach, California recently. A local mother, who asked not to be identified, was taking a picture of her 12-year-old son and a friend just as they were about to catch a wave when the shark appeared in the break. 'It was quite a shock to see,' the mother told KTLA. 'Many local surfers and lifeguards have seen this and believe it to be a shark,' she added. 'Of course, I told my kids it was a dolphin, as we live at the beach and are in the waters here almost daily.' Scroll down for video . Snapped: A Manhattan Beach mother captured this rare image of a great white through the break of a wave while her son and a friend were out in the water recently . Lately, more and more juvenile great white sharks have been spotted in the area. Local Jay Dohner paddle boarded the waters off Manhattan Beach earlier this month equipped with his video camera when he heard about the great whites and captured not one but three great whites in the water. 'The sharks didn't seem to be paying me any attention,' he told the Los Angeles Times. 'They looked like they were looking for fish, so I felt I could stand there safely and watch them.' Local authorities say the sharks post no threat to swimmers. Caught on camera: Another local man went paddle-boarding off Manhattan beach recently to see if he could spot any great whites and saw three within a five minute span . Scary: Jay Dohner captured video of the experience spotting the apex predators from the top of his paddle board . Seeing the sharks closer to shore has actually been heralded as a victory by marine biologists. They're saying its evidence that a law prohibiting the use of gill nets for fishing passed in 1990 is leading to a healthy rebound of wildlife in the ocean. For now, the white sharks are under special protection by the state during a review period on whether to list them as a threatened or an endangered species.","A great white shark snuck behind a couple of surfers in Manhattan Beach recently .

"Mark Reckless, right, with his wife Catriona, said only the public sector elite supports Labour . Ukip won in Rochester because the Labour Party now represents only the public sector elite, according to Mark Reckless. The former Tory, who retained his seat with a modest majority after switching to Nigel Farage’s party, used his victory speech to tell supporters that Ed Miliband and his team were out of touch. He said Ukip had become the ‘radicals’ of British politics, snatching votes from the opposition party. He declared: ‘The radical tradition, which has stood and spoken for the working class, has found a new home in Ukip. ‘As Labour represents those comfortable at the top of the public sector, it is not Ed Miliband, but Ukip that represents the concerns of most working men and women.’ Ukip’s second member of parliament claimed that the poll in Rochester and Strood – which was deemed by experts to be only Ukip’s 271st most winnable seat – showed they could win anywhere in the country. Meanwhile, Nigel Farage predicted another wave of defections to Ukip before the General Election, with party polling suggesting they could pick up dozens of seats. Mr Reckless, who stood down in order to trigger the showdown with his former party, regained the Kent seat for Ukip with 16,867 votes, a majority of only 2,920. Conservative candidate Kelly Tolhurst won 13,947 votes. And Labour’s Naushabah Khan came third with 6,713 votes. The Liberal Democrats continued a humiliating string of by-election performances, finishing fifth behind the Greens, and losing another deposit, with just 349 votes. All three main parties saw their share of the vote fall compared with the last general election, with the Lib Dems down by 15.39 per cent, the Tories by 14.39 per cent and Labour by 11.7 per cent. A total of 40,065 votes were cast, a turnout of 50.61 per cent. Following his win Mr Reckless got an early train to London to be sworn in as an MP, and vote with Labour on a law to rein in private companies’ role in the health service. Claiming victory just before 5am yesterday, Mr Reckless declared: ‘We will give you back your country.’ He also vowed to back low taxes, localism and independence from the European Union. Mr Farage said yesterday morning that Ukip had made major advances in Strood, traditionally a Labour-supporting area, although Ukip also took votes from Tories and previous non-voters. He said the party had not done as well in more affluent Rochester, where it had been ‘difficult’ to win over many middle-class Tory voters. Ukip’s first directly elected MP, Douglas Carswell, who represents Clacton, predicted the party could win ‘dozens’ more seats from Labour. He suggested his party could replace Labour as the main opposition by offering a modern version of the ‘free market, economically liberal’ administrations of William Gladstone in the 19th century. Nigel Farage, right, took Mark Reckless' victory as an opportunity to claim that more MPs will defect to Ukip . Ukip’s latest victory showed that, by appealing directly to ex-Labour voters, the party has an opportunity to ‘undo the tragedy of the 1920s’, when Labour became the second party of British politics, he said. ‘So much of Britain is now run in the interests of various vested interests, there is an extraordinary opportunity for a new, free market, economically liberal party committed to far-reaching, radical political reform,’ said Mr Carswell. ‘Think of it as Gladstone dotcom.’ Mr Reckless faced an uphill struggle against his former Tory colleagues, as David Cameron made it his mission to keep the seat and ordered all MPs to make three visits there. Earlier this week, the Ukip campaign was rocked by comments Mr Reckless made at a hustings. He suggested if Britain leaves the EU, migrants already settled in this country may have to be repatriated – although he later clarified this was not his view. His victory speech paid tribute to the ‘more than a dash of support’ he had received from EU immigrants during the contest. He added: ‘They are now here as part of our community and they will always be welcome.’ Mr Reckless was heckled by Labour MPs in the House of Commons yesterday as he defended his views on the NHS. He now wants to repeal a bill which he voted for as a Conservative. Ukip have moved significantly leftwards in the past year as they have picked up more and more support among working-class voters in by-elections in the north of England. They nearly won last month’s contest in Heywood and Middleton, Greater Manchester, a safe Labour seat in the party’s former industrial heartlands, coming within 617 votes of victory.","Mark Reckless claimed that Ed Miliband and Labour were out of touch .

"A teenage yob who robbed a pregnant woman causing her to lose the baby she ‘already saw as a human being’ was locked up yesterday. David Wellington, 17, was one of three men who ‘ambushed’ factory worker Bozena Nowak as she waited for a bus to work at 5.50am on Saturday, October 11. The trio grabbed her bag from her, which contained £140 cash for her weekly grocery shop, leaving her ‘frightened and upset’. Bozena Nowak, pictured, lost her baby after she was 'ambushed' by three men while waiting on a bus to work . Mrs Nowak was attacked as she waited for a bus at this stop on Saturday October 11 at 5.50am in Salford . Later that day Mrs Nowak, 43, realised she was bleeding and a scan on the Monday confirmed she had miscarried. Doctors said it was caused by ‘sudden and major stress’. The mother-of-three was eight weeks pregnant with a baby which she and her warehouse worker husband Jerzy, 37, had planned. In a statement read to Manchester Crown Court by Neil Beckwith, prosecuting, she said: ‘The whole family were happy about the new arrival. ‘Me and my husband are devastated we have lost a human being, because for me it was already a human being.’ Polish-born Mrs Nowak, who had no problems with her previous pregnancies, added she was ‘heartbroken’ and ‘felt like crying all the time’. The incident has left her too scared to go out on her own or get the bus to work, the court heard. The court was shown CCTV footage revealing how Wellington and two accomplices – who have not been found – gathered behind the bus stop in Salford where Mrs Nowak was sitting alone. They could be seen talking and gesturing towards their victim, before creeping up on either side of the bus stop and pouncing. Manchester Crown Court heard that Mrs Nowak and her husband Jerzy, left, are devastated by the loss . One man ‘pushed and pulled’ at her clothing and shouted ‘grab the bag’, while the other unidentified suspect pulled it off her, Mr Beckwith said. Wellington was keeping lookout and could be seen running away as the attack took place. Police officers who recognised him from CCTV footage later found Mrs Nowak’s bus ticket and purse containing family photographs at his home, which was minutes from the scene. Her cash and keys were never recovered. Mr Beckwith said: ‘She said the incident itself lasted around a minute. In her words she felt she was ambushed by them.’ David Williams, pictured,  was recognised by police officers who viewed CCTV footage of the incident . Wellington, who admitted robbery at an earlier hearing, is a serial offender who has racked up 18 previous convictions for 32 offences including robbery, theft and escape from police custody in five years since he was 12 years old. Defending, Iain Johnstone said Wellington’s mother had written to the court to say he had been ‘one sleep away from a new life’ as the family had planned to move out of the area the day after the incident to get away from negative influences on her son. ‘He accepts he was part and parcel of this,’ he added. ‘He didn’t go out with any intention of committing a crime. ‘He can be seen running away whilst the violence takes place. He leaves the scene first but everyone goes back to his house. There’s clear evidence of remorse in his case.’ Judge Michael Leeming QC lifted an order banning the reporting of the youth’s name, saying the public ‘had a right to know’ who had committed the ‘serious offence’. Sentencing him to 28 months detention, he said he accepted Wellington played ‘no physical part’ in the attack and was ‘genuinely remorseful’. He added: ‘It has caused (Mrs Nowak) significant stress and she had lost the child she was so looking forward to. You must share some of the responsibility for that miscarriage and the loss of that child. ‘It is one of the perils of attacking a woman that she may be pregnant. And unfortunately for you and unfortunately for her, she was pregnant. She is entitled to know that the courts take these sorts of offences seriously.’","David Wellington was with two men who robbed Bozena Nowak in October .

"A man has been arrested as part of a cold-case investigation into a mother-of-three who was killed while moonlighting as a prostitute. Lester Ralph Jones, 63, was on Friday charged with murder, kidnapping and arson in the death of 34-year-old Paige Birgfeld, of Grand Junction, Colorado, who went missing in 2007. Birgfeld's remains were found in a dry creek bed in 2012, 30 miles away from where she lived. Arrested: Lester Ralph Jones, 63, (left) was on Friday charged with murder, kidnapping and arson in the death of 34-year-old Paige Birgfeld (right), of Grand Junction, Colorado, who went missing in 2007 . The Colorado Bureau of Investigation's cold-case team was assigned the case. Birgfeld was twice divorced and lived with her three children. Friends knew her as a devoted mother and businesswoman. But a 46-page arrest affidavit against Jones also describes her escort service. Authorities say Jones, a longtime suspect, was a client. They discovered he had frequently used Birgfeld's out-call service and had arranged meetings with her in the days before she disappeared. She was reported missing in July of 2007 and her car was found torched just days later. Her remains were discovered by a hiker in 2012. When she vanished her eight-year-old daughter walked into the sheriff's office to inform them she had not come home from work two days earlier. While selling Pampered Chef kitchen tools and baby slings from her home, Birgfield also ran the escort service Models Inc . Double life: Birgfeld was twice divorced and lived with her three children. Friends knew her as a devoted mother and businesswoman, but she moonlighted as a prostitute and ran an escort service called Models Inc . Evidence: The mother's burned out car was found three days after she went missing . Court records do not list an attorney for him. Mesa County Sheriff-elect Matt Lewis told the Denver Post that there is a 'very circumstantial basis to this case,' but feels there is enough evidence showing Jones is Birgfeld's killer. He added: 'We believe it at this point we have crossed off the list all the things we needed to do to make an arrest. 'There's not a significant event as much as this is an exhaustive process we've been going through. We are at the point where we feel we have checked every box that's come before us.' Discovery: Her remains were found in this dry creek by hikers 30 miles away from where she lived. Her eight-year-old daughter reported Birgfeld missing after she had failed to return from work for two days. Her father Frank, pictured in 2012 stands over it . Limited signs: When her remains were found, Birgfeld's family said they were unaware of her secret but her father said certain clues, like keeping hold of one of her ex-husband's cars an 'unknown reason, was a clue . When her remains were found two years ago, her father Frank, then aged 68, remembered his daughter as buoyant and positive. He said: 'Man, she is, she was very rarely negative. Always looked at things on the bright side. Had a great smile and showed it a lot. And clearly what she liked the most was showing off her kids.' Mr Birgfeld said he didn't know about his daughter's business: 'Absolutely, we weren't aware of it.' In retrospect, Ms Birgfeld's father admitted that there were clues to his daughter's secret life, including the fact she kept one of her ex-husband's cars for unknown reasons. He said: 'That was the car she was using for that purpose. I look back, it's obvious.'","Lester Ralph Jones, 63 has been charged with the murder of Paige Birgfeld .

"Francois Hollande has been pictured for the first time with his ‘secret’ lover Julie Gayet – relaxing in the official home of the French president. According to French sources Gayet has been a regular fixture at the Elysee Palace for months. The images of the pair sitting in the gardens of the Elysee Palace come as former first lady Valerie Trierweiler prepares to arrives in Britain. She was unceremoniously dumped by Mr Hollande in January, but is now promoting a kiss-and-tell book subtitled: ‘A story of love, power and betrayal’. Scroll down for video . Caught in the act: The pictures, published by a French magazine, shows Francois Hollande and his rumoured girlfriend Julie Gayet, 42, sitting in the gardens of the Elysee Palace in Paris . It describes how Mr Hollande, 60, carried out a secret affair with Ms Gayet, a 42-year-old TV actress, behind her back. The head of state was infamously pictured coming out of their love nest, just around the corner from the Elysee, trying to use a crash helmet to hide his identity. But today Voici magazine shows Mr Hollande and Ms Gayet together for the first time in a spread entitled ‘Pictures of a couple in love’. They show Mr Hollande wearing a suit and tie, as he leans towards his girlfriend, while she looks lovingly into his eyes. There was speculation in Paris today that Mr Hollande may have allowed the blurred pictures to appear as a message to Ms Trierweiler, 49, who has been hugely vitriolic towards him. The new girl: In the pictures Hollande leaning towards actress Gayet, while she looks lovingly into his eyes . Perfect timing: The pictured appeared in French media as former first lady Valerie Trierweiler heads to Britain to promote a kiss-and-tell book about the President on the Andrew Marr show and Newsnight . Tell-all: Mr Hollande's ex girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler (left) as she is interviewed by Sophie Raworth for The Andrew Marr Show . There was speculation in Paris today that Mr Hollande may have allowed the blurred pictures to appear as a message to Ms Trierweiler, 49, who has been hugely vitriolic towards him . She is expected to pour further humiliation on the man she portrays as a liar and a cheat while appearing on flagship BBC programmes including the Andrew Marr show and Newsnight. Asked about his affair on French TV earlier this month, Mr Hollande replied: ‘If I made mistakes, I recognise them. There are pains, and I forgive them.’ But his ambiguous – not to say confusing – reply did not mention well sourced claims that Ms Gayet is actually staying overnight at the presidential palace, and there are even claims that she has her own bodyguard. Many have complained that taxpayers' money is being used to fund the president's relationship with Ms Gayet, but this has not stopped her issuing privacy complaints through the French courts. Party time: Mr Hollande enjoys the attention of a dancer at the Dinner for representatives from French Overseas Territories in Paris last night . The latest photographs were taken in October, when Ms Gayet is said to have tried to throw photographers off the scent by having a driver approach from different routes. She is said to always enter the Elysee Palace via a stately back gate. Asked whether his secret trysts with Ms Gayet had debased the institution of the presidency, Mr Hollande said in the TV interview: ‘I think the responsibility is collective. I don’t want to shirk my responsibilities but there comes a time when one must respect private life.’ The President, who has four grown up children with his ecology minister, Segolene Royal, is officially single, and his press office would not comment on the Voice photos. The latest opinion polls show Mr Hollande’s popularity at a record low of 12 per cent, and his hopes of re-election in 2017 already look extremely thin. Back in Europe:  Hollande posed with former French President Jacques Chirac at the award ceremony for the Prix de la Fondation Chirac at the Quai Branly Museum in Paris on Friday .

"The annals of war are full of stories of lovelorn soldiers on the front line, dreaming wistfully of a girl back home. Evangeline Poteat was one such dream girl ... but rather than consuming the thoughts of a single soldier, she was desired by three. Now, a collection of 18 love letters sent to the 22-year-old factory worker from the trio of admirers during the Second World War are to go under the hammer. They reveal three men in love, each fighting on two fronts: on one for their country, and on another for her heart. Never met: Evangeline Poteat (right) ultimately chose Teal Davis (left), an air-crew chief stationed in Burma - even though they had never met . Under the hammer: A collection of 18 love letters sent to the 22-year-old factory worker from the trio of admirers during the Second World War are to go under the hammer . Love battle: They reveal three men in love, each fighting on two fronts - on one for their country, and on the other for her heart . Two of the men she knew, having dated them before the outbreak of war in her hometown of Bakersville, North Carolina. The third she had never met. What followed was a war of passion between the three men - though it is unclear if each knew of the others' intentions - fought on paper with pen and ink. 'I know that you think that I am crazy for asking you so many times,' one writes from Camp Cooke, an Army training center in California. 'Did you think the ring idea is OK with you, or is it? I love you.' Another, also based in California, remembers his high school days with Evangeline, gushing: 'We used to really have a swell time until Uncle Sam nabbed me.' But it was the third she ultimately chose, thanks to his 11 intimate letters that reveal a man in love - despite never having laid eyes on the object of his affections. His name was Teal Davis, an air-crew chief stationed in Burma. Competition: Two of the men she knew, having dated them before the outbreak of war in her hometown of Bakersville, North Carolina. The third she had never met (This is one of Teal's letters from Burma) Paper battlefield: What followed was a war of passion between the three men - though it is unclear if each knew of the others' intentions - fought on paper with pen and ink . His first dispatch begins with 'Hello, Van.' But as their communications become more intimate, that turns to 'Dearest' and he signs off with 'Always'. Enigmatically, the collection contains none of Evangeline's responses to any of the men, so the reader is left to imagine what she must have felt. But what is clear is each man's intentions: they all yearned for the war to end so they could return to marry their sweetheart. Seventy years on, the letters, revealed by The State newspaper, are being sold by Sally MacNamara Ivey, a collector of historical memorabilia from Portland, Oregon. She bought them from a Portland dealer for $35. How they ended up in Portland - so far from Evangeline's home - is a mystery. War hero: Teal was awarded the Soldier's Medal for bravery and heroism beyond the call of duty when he and three others rescued a crew member after an oxygen tank exploded, catching a plane on fire . Ivey auctioned the letters on eBay, under the heading 'Handwritten World War II love letters.' She said in the listing: 'I really wanted to see a photo of her after reading these letters, too, because she was quite the beauty according to the three soldiers who wrote to her.' She remembers being struck by 'how deeply in love' Evangeline and Teal were, despite having never met. She was introduced to Teal through his sister, a college friend of Evangeline at Appalachian State Teachers College where she was studying to be a teacher in 1943. Married: Teal, 25, and Evangeline, 23, married on April 21, 1946, in a candlelight wedding at Bakersville Baptist Church. She wore a white-lace gown with an amethyst-and-pearl necklace that belonged to her grandmother . But she didn't actually write to him until 1944, after she had postponed her education to join the war effort, making anti-aircraft shells for the Navy in a munitions factory in Charlotte. He wrote back on May 15, just three weeks before the Allied troops would storm Normandy in the D-Day invasion. Rather than discuss the dangers he faces in Burma, Teal instead writes about his love for the North Carolina mountains. 'A fellow never realizes how beautiful his own home country is until he gets halfway around the world from it. 'I was just thinking of the noises you can hear in those mountains early in the mornings and comparing them with here. Over here just walking to work (in knee-deep mud, of course) you hear wild chickens, parrots screeching, monkeys screaming and carrying on, and then comes the roar of airplane engines --- such a combination. ... 'I'll be looking forward to the day when I can meet you in person, but for now a letter will do. Be good, have fun this summer and write soon. 'Sincerely, Teal.' In his letters - some as long as seven pages - he writes about the monotony of breakfast - how they ate 'french toast, powdered eggs, french toast, powdered eggs'. He tells how he spent evenings watching movies, including The Wizard of Oz or wondering when he'd next hear back from her. Then, on December 2, 1944, seven months since their first correspondence, Teal sends two photographs of himself, and asks Evangeline the burning question. 'Home or church wedding?' he writes. 'Those big weddings are pretty and all, but a simple little home marriage seems more earnest and sincere. ... 'What I'm trying to say is that I only want to get married once and that's for keeps.' He continues: 'I'll never be content until I've met you and tried to make some daydreams come true. 'You know, I've quit trying to reason out why I should fall for someone I've never met - it just happened.' He often quotes song lyrics to describe how he feels when he opens her mail: 'I feel like a feather in the breeze' and 'It rains pennies from heaven.' He also impresses her with his sense of humour and penchant for word play. In one letter he describes his comrades' reactions to a movie, The Rainbow Road. Lifetime of happiness: They lived out their days enjoying the quiet life. Teal worked in the post office for more than 20 years, then for more than 25 years at the family's building supplies business . Emotional: Reading their father's letters was an emotional experience for the couple's two children, Larry Davis, 67, and Jane Simmons, 63, who had no idea they existed. They said reading his words as a young man in love with their mother, brought him back to life for a moment . 'You know the kind (of movie it is) - lots of girls in sarongs, but not so much sarong on the girls. The way the guys were ohing and ahing there wasn't anything sarong (so wrong) with the picture.' Teal was awarded the Soldier's Medal for bravery and heroism beyond the call of duty when he and three others rescued a crew member after an oxygen tank exploded, catching a plane on fire. By March 1945, it appears he received from her the news he had longed for. 'You asked if I minded you saying that you love me,' he writes. 'Hon, I'm just happy that you can say that.' Teal, 25, and Evangeline, 23, married on April 21, 1946, in a candlelight wedding at Bakersville Baptist Church. She wore a white-lace gown with an amethyst-and-pearl necklace  that belonged to her grandmother. They had two children, Larry, born in 1947, and Jane, in 1951. They lived out their days enjoying the quiet life. Teal worked in the post office for more than 20 years, then for more than 25 years at the family's building supplies business. Evangeline brought up their children before returning to college to get her teaching certificate, then She was a teacher from 1963 until the mid-1980s. Teal died in 2001 of emphysema. 'Evangeline rarely left his side - only to get chemotherapy for her throat cancer, and for an occasional rest when her family demanded it, wrote The Slate. Evangeline suffered a stroke in February 2004. She died a year later. Their children, Larry Davis, 67, and Jane Simmons, 63, told The Slate of their surprise that the letters that brought their parents together during World War II still exist and had emerged on eBay. And they have no idea how they ended up in Portland. Nevertheless, reading their father's words as a young man in love with their mother, brought him back to life for a moment. 'I can hear him,' Larry said. 'But a lot of it is the way I never heard him.'","Evangeline Poteat was a factory worker during WWII from Bakersville .

"A taxi driver and his three friends have been sentenced for a total of 68 years over the rape of a drunk passenger. Tamseel Virk, 42, Najim U-Saeed, 31, Wakar Akhtar, 21, and Azad Raja, 38, were each handed 17 year jail terms for the 'despicable' attack on the vulnerable woman in Bradford, Yorkshire. A judge heard how taxi driver Virk picked up the intoxicated victim after she had been out celebrating a friend's birthday in Leeds. Taxi driver Tamseel Virk (left) and Najim U-Saeed (right) are among four men sentenced to a combined total of 68 years over a 'despicable' rape attack on a drunk passenger . When she came round, she found Raja was having sex with her - while Akhtar told her he had already had sex with her. Virk, U-Saeed and Raja were sentenced at Bradford Crown Court. Akhtar was also sentenced but is currently on the run - and is believed to have fled the country after giving evidence, the court heard. His Honour Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told the court that the victim had been enjoying herself earlier in the evening of May 25. But she ended up 'coming to her senses on a park bench in another city being raped'. Describing the victim's experience as a nightmare, he told the three men in the dock: 'This was totally despicable, it was utterly callous, it was a degree of inhuman behaviour hard, even for one such as myself inured to evil, to understand.' During the two-week trial, in which the men denied conspiracy to rape, the court heard that the teacher had been drunk when she left the party without her bag and was seen at Leeds train station. The judge said: 'On that day, as was her right, she enjoyed at the birthday party a number of drinks. That is part, gentlemen, of our culture.' At some point she had got in a taxi to travel to wherever she was staying but had got out again in a confused state - possibly regarding getting her bag back. It was then, the court heard, that Vick saw her and 'accosted her and secured her in the presence of the cab' according to the judge. Azad Raja (left) and Wakar Akhtar (right) were also sentenced to 17 years each. Akhtar was sentenced in his absence having gone on the run after giving evidence, the court heard . Vick then drove the confused woman from Leeds, West Yorkshire, to Bradford, 11 miles away - and to a destination she had not asked for. During the journey, the court heard, there were 15 phone calls made between Vick and the other defendants. 'This was four men putting into place an operation to do that which the jury have found,' said Judge Durham Hall, adding that their victim was a young vulnerable woman. After meeting at a park in Bradford the court heard Akhtar had invited his uncle Raja to 'join in the fun'. Their victim came to in the early hours of the May 26 being held and being raped by a man. During the trial, the court heard that U-Saeed then turned up 'too late physically to join in the rape that he had set up'. Speaking to the court via a video screen the woman spoke briefly to the court to give her victim impact statement. She told the court that prior to the incident she was a confident independent woman. 'I had been planning to settle down and start and family with my partner of four years. 'Following the 25th [of May] I felt I had the identity and everything I had worked for kicked out of me.' His Honour Judge Jonathan Durham Hall QC told Bradford Crown Court (pictured) that the behaviour of the men was 'utterly callous' She added: 'Something so horrific and personal has happened. I do believe I won't let what's happened get the better of me.' Senior Investigating Officer, Detective Chief Inspector Steve Snow, said: 'Firstly, I want to praise the courage of the victim in this case, who has had to give evidence during the trial, against the men convicted today. 'These men have been found guilty of a despicable crime against a vulnerable lone female, who was taking a taxi home after a night out. 'Tamseel Virk had collected the victim in Leeds, her intention was to go home. 'Unfortunately Virk realising her vulnerability, sexually assaulted her in his car. 'Following this appalling act, he then arranged with friends to deliver her to them. 'She was then taken to a park in Bradford, miles from where she intended to be dropped off, whilst there she was forced to commit sexual acts on the other males present. 'I have no doubt whatsoever that the events of that night have had a significant and profound effect on the victim. 'We hope that the sentences passed by the courts today will give the victim in this case some comfort and help her to try and now move on with her life. 'We also hope that today's sentence will give victims of similar offences the confidence to come forward and report these matters to our specially trained officers, who will robustly and thoroughly investigate with sensitivity all reports with the aim of securing convictions against offenders.'","Four men each given 17 years for conspiring to rape vulnerable woman .

"A baby gorilla in San Francisco may not have been crushed to death under an electric door if zoo leaders had responded to zookeepers' concerns about the enclosure's safety. The 30-year-old gorilla enclosure had a flawed layout, problems with the doors and was understaffed, five zookeepers told the San Francisco Chronicle in a story published Thursday. 'It was a freak accident,' said Corey Hallman, one of the animal keepers. 'But with a workplace that takes safety and keeper input more seriously, it could have been prevented.' Scroll down for video . Baby Kabibe pictured with her mother in January before her tragic death earlier this mont . The 16-month-old gorilla named Kabibe (kuh-BEE'-bay) died Nov. 7 when she unexpectedly darted under the door as it closed. Zoo Executive Director Tanya Peterson has said the worker operating the hydraulic door failed to keep her hand on an emergency stop button as required. Zoo officials declined to comment on the keepers' complaints. They are investigating Kabibe's death. Peterson said in a guest editorial in The Chronicle that the U.S. Department of Agriculture routinely inspects the enclosure, and in January, found no 'noncompliant' issues with the exhibit. 'Nothing in recent inspection reports gave me reason to believe there was anything wrong with the exhibit,' Peterson wrote. But an outside investigator found the enclosure is outdated and unsafe. The doors have a history of mechanical failures, including jamming and unexpectedly collapsing, according to zoo records. Lowland gorillas pictured at the San Francisco Zoo in the wake of the tragic accidental death . An adult gorilla had her hand caught under a door in July 2012, according to zoo records cited by the Chronicle. The zookeepers say the control panel to operate the doors in the gorilla exhibit also does not have a clear view of all the doors. 'It's a very stressful situation,' Dayna Sherwood, one of the zookeepers, said. 'You can't always see what everyone's doing.' In a Nov. 6, 2013, email to managers, a zookeeper proposed hiring another person to help move gorillas and chimpanzees into their night quarters. Amy Corso, one of the zookeepers interviewed by The Chronicle, said the zoo issued a requirement that a second worker be on hand to help while gorillas are moved following Kabibe's death.","Baby gorilla died under an electric door that crushed her on Nov. 7 .

'Then my sister came back along the road, and she said there are ambulances and a lot of people here. I saw everybody outside, there were too many people. 'They took people inside. There were people in pyjamas and people without coats. They gave them blankets. I think they did well. 'I hope they've taken them to another hotel because they were standing around. I felt it, I heard the sound. I thought it might be an accident, a car crashing into the hotel.' Mr Albarrak was originally supposed to be staying in the Hyatt but changed his reservation to the Radisson opposite just before he arrived.

"An investigation has been launched into the death of a seven-year-old girl shot dead on her doorstep by her estranged father who then turned the gun on himself. Mary Shipstone was brutally killed on September 11 as she clutched her violin outside her mother's home in Northiam, East Sussex. She had been shot by her Egyptian father, Yasser Alromisse, who is thought to have carried out the act as revenge against her mother who had recently turned her back on Islam. Mary Shipstone (left) was killed by her estranged father Yasser Alromisse (right) on her mother's doorstep on September 11 as she returned from school . More than two months after their deaths, the East Sussex Local Safeguarding Children Board have called for a review of the case. The board will look at how children can be better protected in the future. Following the child's death it emerged her mother, Lyndsey Shipstone, had been hiding from her abusive former partner for years. The 42-year-old married Alromisse in Liverpool in 2005 and converted to Islam. Later she fled with Mary, allegedly begging lawyers not to tell him where they had run to. On September 11 he appeared outside their house and killed their daughter with 'a terrible bang'. By the time police arrived the 45-year-old council worker had turned the gun on himself. Speaking after her daughter's death, Miss Shipstone said: ''As soon as I put the front door key in there was a terrible bang behind me. I turned round – and Mary was on the ground. 'I saw her father with the gun in his hand pointing at Mary’s head and he fired a second time, and then he retreated into the car and I just dropped down to Mary and dragged her round the front of the house away from the car.

I realised I had to get her away.’ Mary died in Kings College Hospital in London the following day. Concerns were raised over how Almromisse came to learn of the pair's location in September. Sussex Police said it was investigating how the man came to be in the area.","Mary Shipstone was shot in head on the doorstep of her mother's home .

"Jihadi: Fraudster turned terrorist Hamayun Tariq claims his British passport has been revoked . A former car mechanic who fled Britain and joined the Taliban after serving a prison sentence for fraud has joined the Islamic State and is now fighting in Syria, it has been claimed. Hamayun Tariq, a divorced 37-year-old who was born and raised in Dudley in the West Midlands, is understood to have joined ISIS seven weeks ago, and has been claiming a salary and housing benefits from the terror group ever since. The father of two claims to be an explosives expert and, although his social media accounts are currently suspended, is notorious for posting chilling  bomb-making guides for  Western jihadis. Tariq is understood to use the nom de guerre Abu Muslim Al-Britani and has previously posted under the Twitter handle @MuslimVictory, although that account was deleted last week after he posted sickening calls for terror attacks in the UK. He also regularly posted photographs of handwritten instructions explaining how to assemble crude explosive devices and listing the chemicals needed to create deadly poisons. Tariq's  Twitter rants appear to have been in retaliation for him allegedly having his British passport revoked last year. One of his most widely shared messages was a sarcastic note of 'thanks' to Home Secretary Theresa May for 'revoking my British citizenship'. Alongside the message was page after page of bomb-making material from a 2006 terrorist manual named the Mujahideen Explosives Handbook. His distribution of the material led to his @MuslimVictory Twitter account being suspended a short time later and all of his messages deleted. Explosives expert: Hamayun Tariq's distribution of the bomb-making material led to his @MuslimVictory Twitter account being suspended last week and all of his messages deleted . Stronghold: Tariq is likely to be living and working in the Syrian city of Raqqa (pictured) - ISIS' de facto capital . Tariq claims to have encountered up to 40 other British nationals in seven weeks since he joined ISIS is Syria, according to the Guardian, who say they spoke to him via Twitter's private messaging function before his account was eventually disabled. Describing himself as 'really happy' to have joined the terror group, he reportedly added that he had also met a 'fixer' who was smuggling 1,000 new recruits into ISIS-held areas of Syria every week. He reportedly told the newspaper that he first embraced radical Islam in 2000. Tariq was arrested for fraud in Wolverhampton in 2005 but fled to Pakistan to avoid the case going to trial. He was deported back to Britain two years later and served three and a half years in prison. He claims to have left Britain immediately after his release in 2012 and moved to the Waziristan region of north west Pakistan, where he joined the local Taliban branch. In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport to join the terror group in Syria. He was trained as a sniper before moving on to specialise in explosives - a subject he has been interested in since studying for a GCSE in Science in the mid-1990s. Militants: In September or early October Tariq is understood to have been contacted by ISIS fixers who paid for his transport from Pakistan to join the terror group (pictured) in northern Syria . The Home Office says there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS but that figure may be much higher . Tariq described his new life under ISIS as far more comfortable than that in Pakistan. 'Life was tough in Waziristan but here I can't believe I get a salary, I get rent. They even paid for my transport. I'm really happy here and all the guys I've met from the UK are also happy and settled,' he was quoted as saying. The Home Office would not speak about Tariq's claim that his passport had been cancelled, saying they could not comment on individual cases. However they did add that in a broader sense any individual who has conducted himself 'in a manner seriously prejudicial to the vital interests of the UK' can have their citizenship revoked. The Home Office has said there are at least 500 Britons fighting for ISIS in Syria and Iraq, although a number of experts believe the real figure is likely to greatly exceed that. Last week Kurdish experts told The Independent that the terror group now has an army of up to 200,000 men alongside a population of several million non-combatants The figures are totally unprecedented for fighters belonging to a terrorist organisation.","Hamayun Tariq, 37, believed to have joined ISIS in Syria seven weeks ago .

"Along with his more sensationalized executive order granting some illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the U.S. without fear of deportation, President Barack Obama quietly ended a controversial program on Thursday that had deported 283,000 of them after they were arrested for crimes other than border-crossing. The Secure Communities program has been in place in limited form since 2006, and expanded nationwide in 2008. It allowed local law enforcement to hold arrestees and convicts 48 hours after they were officially bailed or released, if they were in the county illegally, so federal agents could pick them up and start immigration proceedings. Instead, the administration has replaced it with a much narrower program that limits the list of qualifying offenses and only lets the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency intervene after an illegal immigrant is convicted. Many make bail and never return to court to face their charges, however. SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE HOMELAND SECURITY ORDERS . Sad inheritance: Detective Michael David Davis Jr. was killed by a Southern California illegal immigrant who had been deported twice already . RAISING THE BAR: Only illegal immigrants convicted of felonies and other serious crimes will be handed over to immigration authorities, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson announced Thursday . 'The president’s decision to suspend a program helping law enforcement identify and deport dangerous criminals from our country is indefensible,' Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn said Friday, 'and his actions will only tie the hands of law enforcement officials trying to keep criminals off our streets and our communities safe.' Rampage: Monroy-Bracamonte was charged with murdering two police officers in a shooting rampage along with his wife . Obama, he said, 'has neither the will nor the leadership ability to do what presidents before him have done: work with Congress to achieve meaningful reforms. Instead, he’s chosen to ignore the rule of law and launch another massive executive power grab that has grave security consequences for all Americans.' Obama's decision could help the federal government prioritize its strained resources to focus on deporting 'felons, not families,' as Obama promised in a prime-time speech Thursday night. 'We're going to keep focusing enforcement resources on actual threats to our security,' he said. But if his aim is to focus on the worst of the worst, his administration has a tough road ahead. Last year ICE released more than 36,000 convicted criminal aliens while they were awaiting deportation, according to a May report from the Center for Immigration Studies. Those illegal immigrants included more than 16,070 convicted of driving while drunk or under the influence of drugs, 5,000 convicted of larceny, 303 kidnappers, 1,160 car thieves, 193 killers and 426 convicted of sexual assault. One of the murderers was convicted of willfully killing a law enforcement officer. ICE said in May that most of the 36,000 were released under restrictions such as GPS monitoring, telephone monitoring or other supervision; some merely had to pay a bond. In about 8 per cent of cases, courts ordered ICE to release them because their home countries refused to take them back. 'What possible justification could there be for freeing a murderer who is being deported? Dozens of times?' Center for Immigration Studies policy studies director asked CBS News at the time. 'The vast majority of these releases were discretionary, or even contrary to the requirements of various provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act,' the group said in a statement. The reinvented Secure Communities Program, now called the 'Priority Enforcement Program' – the Homeland Security Department calls it 'PEP' – will 'only seek the transfer of an alien in the custody of state or local law enforcement through the new program when the alien has been convicted of' a narrow list of crimes, according to a memo from DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson to ICE Acting Director Thomas Winkowski. Those crimes include all felonies other than immigration related crimes, street gang violence, a third or subsequent non-traffic-related misdemeanor, domestic violence, sexual abuse and burglary. They do not include the crime of crossing America's borders illegally. VAYA CON DIOS: President Barack Obama said goodbye to the Secure Communities program when he announced an immigration policy overhaul Thursday night . 'INDEFENSIBLE': Texas Sen. John Cornyn said the new order will make it harder for police and sheriffs to do their jobs . ICE can also take custody of criminal convicts whom they believe are 'engaged in or suspected of terrorism or espionage, or who otherwise pose a danger to national security. But 'unless the alien poses a demonstrable risk to national security,' Johnson wrote, 'enforcement actions through the new program will only be taken against aliens who are convicted of specifically enumerated crimes.' Many cities and counties in the U.S. long ago stopped cooperating with ICE – the Pew Charitable Trusts counted more than 300 and the entire states of California, Colorado and Connecticut – had stopped or curtailed their cooperation. releasing bailed arrestees and convicts on time despite so-called immigration 'detainers' from the agency. Those requests will no longer exist, replaced with a more polite request for a heads-up with an illegal immigrant's jail or prison sentence nears its end. 'I am directing ICE,' Johnson wrote, 'to replace requests for detention (i.e., requests that an agency hold an individual beyond the point at which they would otherwise be released) with requests for notification (i.e. , requests that state or local law enforcement notify ICE of a pending release during the time that person is otherwise in custody under state or local authority).' Secure Communities operated through a digital fingerprinting database that local authorities shared with the federal government, whose analysts dissected it for signs of illegal immigrants. Hispanic activists, however, saw increases in the number of low-level offenders swept up by the dragnet and deported. The program's 'very name has become a symbol of hostility toward the enforcement of our immigration laws,' Johnson wrote Thursday, signalling a deep interest in whether largely urban communities approved of the government's enforcement methods. 2014-Nov DOJ Memos Ending Secure Communities Program uploaded by MailOnline .","'Secure Communities' program was shuttered on Thursday as Obama finalized his immigration executive orders .

"Peter Moses, 27, faces two life sentences but will escape the death penalty . He thought the child was homosexual because he had hit another boy's bottom . The man lived in a one-bed house with a number of women including three 'wives' and nine children . The group belonged to a sect called the Black Hebrews which believes they are direct descendents from ancient tribes of Israel . The leader of a North Carolina religious cult has pleaded guilty to murdering a 28-year-old woman and a four-year-old boy who he thought was gay. Peter Lucas Moses, 27, will face two life sentences for shooting to death Jadon Higganbothan and Antoinetta Yvonne McKoy but will avoid the death penalty because he has agreed to testify against others who acted as accessories in the slayings, including his brother, sister and mother. Moses, who belonged to a sect called the Black Hebrews, lived in a one bedroom house in Durham with the two victims, a number of other women, three of which considered themselves his 'wives', and eight children that he fathered. The group referred to Moses as 'Lord', according to WRAL News. Shot: Jadon Higganbothan, 4, pictured, was killed because Peter Moses believed he was gay . Prosecutors said Moses killed Jadon, the only child in the house who was not his, because he thought he was homosexual as his father had left his mother, Vania Sisk, 25, and because he was told the child had slapped another boy's bottom. Guilty: Peter Lucas Moses Jr., pictured, has pleaded guilty to murdering Antoinetta Mckoy, 28, and four-year-old Jadon Higganbothan . 'In the religious belief of that . organization, homosexuality was frowned on,' WRAL quoted former District . Attorney Tracey Cline as saying. Moses told Ms Sisk to 'get rid' of the child, according to prosecutors. But in October 2010, he took the four-year-old into the garage, shut the door and shot him. He had ordered two of the women to set up computers and speakers in the garage so he could drown out the gunshot by playing the Lord's prayer in Hebrew, prosectors said. Both victims were shot in the head, autopsies uncovered. The decomposing bodies were found stuffed in plastic rubbish bags and lying in shallow graves in the former backyard of Moses' mother, Sheilda Harris, 57. She lived at 2622 Ashe Street until early this year. Ms McKoy was shot just before Christmas in 2010 after Moses learned she could not have children and wanted to leave the group. Prosecutors said she had written diary entries begging 'Lord' not to kill her. Her relatives said she had known the man since she was a teenager and after he convinced her to join his cult they had not heard from her again. On the day she was killed, Ms McKoy had ran to a neighbour's home and asked to call her mother who lived in Washington D.C. Murdered: Antoinetta McKoy, 28, pictured, was killed by Moses and his 'wives' in December 2010 . Sad: Jadon, pictured, was one of nine children living at the house . The neighbour, who didn't call . police, told prosecutors that Moses and the other women came out of the . house and struggled with Ms McKoy and dragged her back inside. A witness told prosecutors he then beat her throughout the day, with the women joining in on at least one occasion. They then attempted to strangle Ms McKoy with an extension cord. Ms . McKoy begged for her life but Ms Sisk got the gun Moses had used to . kill her son and, playing the same religious music played during Jadon's . murder, she shot Ms McKoy several times, killing her, prosecutors said. The group threw a party a few days . later where Moses showed the woman's body to his mother, sister, Shiela . Moses, 20, and brother P. Leonard Moses, 21. The case came to police's attention in February when a young woman escaped from the house at 2109 Pear Tree Lane. Crime scene: The victims were killed in the one-bedroom Durham house, pictured, they shared with Moses, his wives and their children . Sect: Moses, pictured in court, belonged to the Black Hebrew sect . Moses' brother, mother and sister are charged as accessories in Ms McKoy's death. The whistleblower's name has not been revealed but court records show Durham police had a confidential informant in the case. Members . of the Black Hebrews sect believe they have descended directly from the . ancient tribes of Israel. According to court documents, the Black . Hebrews also believe in an impending 'race war'. Moses is currently being held in jail without bond. 'He pleaded guilty to two counts of . first degree murder and agreed to testify against his co-defendants if . he is called upon to testify,' District Attorney Leon Stanback told The . Durham Herald Sun. The other children have been placed in foster homes by Social Services. They . told authorities they feared Moses would do to them 'what he did to . Jadon,' Cline said. 'The children are fearful of Pete Moses Jr.' Cult: Vania Rae Sisk, 25, pictured, has been charged with helping to kill her son Jadon . Sister: Sheila Moses, pictured, is linked to Ms McKoy's slaying . Mother: The bodies were uncovered in at Sheilda Harris's house . Charged: Lavada Harris, pictured, one of Moses' 'wives' is charged in connection with the murder . Wife: Larhonda Smith, pictured, was also one of Moses' 'wives' Accessory: P. Leonard Moses, pictured, was shown Ms McKoy's body at a party after the slaying . Ms Sisk denied having a four-year-old child named Jadon, according to WRAL. Police only verified his existence because of Social Services reports. Moses' three wives - Sisk, 25, Lavada Quinzetta Harris, 40, and Larhonda Renee . Smith, 27 - were charged with murder in Ms McKoy's death and as . accessories in Jadon's slaying. Four of the children living in the . house belonged to Ms Sisk while five were Ms Harris'. The children were . home-schooled. Police said two of the women were pregnant. 'The arrangement was the women would periodically occupy the master suite with (Moses),' Ms Cline said. Jamiel Higganbothan, Jadon's father, told WRAL he was furious that prosecutors went ahead with the plea deal for Moses after he told them he was opposed to the offer of a life sentence. 'Me and my family wanted the death penalty,' Mr Higganbothan said, noting that he initially agreed to the deal but later told prosecutors he had changed his mind. 'I’m really not OK with it at all,' he said of Moses spending his life in prison.","Peter Moses, 27, faces two life sentences but will escape the death penalty .

"Prince William roared with laughter when he was inadvertently introduced as his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, before handing a philanthropic award to the wife of Bill Gates. The Duke of Cambridge was mistakenly presented using Prince Philip's title during a ceremony at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, central London. The embarrassing gaffe was made by the ceremony's toastmaster in front of former Prime Minister Sir John Major, Lord (Paddy) Ashdown and former UN secretary-general Kofi Annan. The Duke of Cambridge (right) was mistakenly presented using Prince Philip's title at the Royal United Services Institute in Whitehall, central London, by the ceremony's toastmaster (left) Prince William handed Melinda Gates the Chatham House Prize in recognition of her humanitarian work over more than two decades helping women and children around the world. She was chosen in recognition of her efforts helping to provide increased access to family planning, life-saving vaccines and better nutrition with the Gates Foundation. 'With her equally remarkable husband Bill, Melinda set up the Gates Foundation to change the world. 'And change it she has, transforming the lives of women, the poor, the sick and the disadvantaged in Africa and elsewhere,' said Prince William. 'The Queen, who has been patron of Chatham House since 1952, sends you this message, which I have the honour of reading now: 'I send my warmest wishes and congratulations to Melinda Gates on being awarded this year's Chatham House Prize for her humanitarian work and her long-standing commitment to philanthropy. Members of the Royal Institute of International Affairs have chosen a worthy winner.'' He roared with laughter when he was inadvertently introduced as his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh . The Prince handed Melinda Gates the Chatham House Prize in recognition of her humanitarian work . Mrs Gates said she was honoured to receive the award but said it was crucial to take the discussion about development out of the realm of posturing and rumour. She said that while it was 'absolutely crucial' to talk about the Ebola epidemic in Africa, it was important not to write the continent off as 'hopeless'. The philanthropist raised the point that with the right information and tools, impoverished people can 'lift themselves up, lift their families up, communities and nations'. 'I sometimes wish we could take your public here and let them witness first hand what Bill and I have witnessed around the world,' said Mrs Gates. 'Since 1990 we have cut in half the number of children who have died under the age of five. At the same time the population has grown by two billion. 'That is incredible.

"An Eastern Washington University faculty member who grew up in Virginia and has always been fascinated with Thomas Jefferson is building a home that looks like Jefferson’s Monticello. Dan Sisson has spent more than a dozen years working on what he calls 'Monticello West'. The Spokesman-Review reports Sisson is using reclaimed materials such as salvaged bricks. The home sits on land near Ford between state property and the Spokane Indian Reservation. Lifelong dream: Eastern Washington University faculty member Dan Sisson grew up in Charlottesville near the Montecillo, and has been building his own in Ford, Washington, since the early 1990s . Construction is about three-quarters complete. Sisson grew up about an hour from Monticello in Charlottesville, Virginia. 'We used to go and have the whole place to ourselves, just wandering, and I fell in love with it,' he told The Spokesman-Review. Jefferson, America's third president, started building Monticello - which means 'little mount' in Italian - when he was 26 years old after inheriting the land from his father. Slaves worked the 5,000 acres of land farming tobacco and other crops. His design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture. Throughout his presidency, he adapted the property to feature different trends of 18th century Europe. Jefferson was buried on the grounds, which is now owned by the Thomas Jefferson Foundation. Montecillo: The neoclassical residence in Charlottesville, Virgininia, is widely regarded as the most beautiful piece of architecture in the United States . Plantation: Jefferson's design was inspired by Italian Renaissance architect Andrea Palladio, widely considered the most influential individual in the history of Western architecture . Sisson, while always wanting to build a replica, saw his plan naturally get in motion in the early 1990's while working as the manager of a Forest Service recreation area near Bend, Oregon. He became friends with employees of the Pozzi Window Co., a business in Bend, and they offered him windows from their yard at $50 a piece. He then happened upon a pickup truck load of marble for $300. 'At that point you can't turn back,' Sisson said. After buying the land in East Washington, he was given 63,000 free bricks from the owner of an antique business in Spokane, which he hauled home '250 bricks at a time for years'. When it came time to the build the iconic dome that sits atop the Monticello, Sisson was quoted $55,000. However, in a major stroke of luck, he got in contact with a Spokane doctor who had heard about his project. The doctor offered to build the dome for him, and did so in his garage in one winter. It cost Sisson $1,650. But there is still much work to be done. Many of the inside rooms are not finished and there is brick work to complete on the exterior. 'Jefferson took 43 years to finish his house,' Sisson said. 'I’m never going to be done.' Sisson is not the first to replicate the Monticello, although his will surely be the cheapest. Another replica: This is a brick-for-brick replica in Somers, Connecticut, of Thomas Jefferson's neoclassical Monticello, that was recently listed for $6.5 million . Architect S Prestley Blake referred to the Charlottesville, Virginia, home as 'the country's most architecturally beautiful residence' S Prestley Blake, co-founder of Friendly's ice cream parlor and an amateur architect, undertook his own replication as a 'swan song' in the run-up to his 100th birthday. Construction began on the Somers, Connecticut, replica in the summer of 2013, after Blake purchased the ten-acre property, which connects to his own 80-acre property by a wooded horse trail. He tore down the church and home that existed on the land. The brick-for-brick replica was recently listed for sale at $6,500,000.","Thomas Jefferson started building his 5,000-acre Monticello plantation in Charlottesville, Virginia, aged 26 in 1776 .

"The intercepted phone calls of an alleged Australian terrorist recruiter, who is charged with helping young people join jihadist networks in Syria, have been heard in court. Sydney man Hamdi Alqudsi allegedly acted as the liaison man and advisor between Australia's most senior Islamic State leader, Mohammad Ali Baryalei, and the would-be terrorists and organised travel, hotel accommodation, different overseas currencies, security, a Syrian contact and 'general encouragement and support', according to the police facts in the case. In alleged phone calls between the two men heard in court on Friday, Baryalei - who is thought to now be dead - told Alqudsi of his experiences on the front line and claimed he was almost hit by a bullet. Scroll down for video . Alleged Syrian recruiter: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday outside a court in central Sydney) is charged with seven counts of recruiting the men to enter 'into a foreign state, namely Syria, with intent to engage in hostile activity in Syria, in particular, engaging in armed hostilities in Syria' The federal prosecutors in the committal hearing against Alqudsi, who faces seven charges of conscripting Australians to join ISIS or other groups in Syria’s civil war, say they have 'overwhelming' evidence of Alqudsi recruiting and instructing young Australian men to go and fight in Syria. The prosecutor tendered more than 100 pages of phone tap records as part of a case against him, at Downing Centre Local Court in Sydney. The prosecutor said Alqudsi had organised for the men to go to 'a particular part of Turkey which was known as the place where the fighters go to'. In one text message, Alqudsi and one of the recruits wrote about 'getting the green light' for the trip into Syria. Despite a statement by Mr Alqudsi's lawyer, Zali Burrows, that the 39-year-old could not be identified as the speaker or texter recruiting the would-be fighters, the prosecution had declared in one text and a telephone call his own name. 'He says ""I am Hamdi Alqudsi"" and in one message 'write my name, Alqudsi"".' Line up and shot: Beautiful Gold Coast private schoolgirl, Amira Karroum (pictured) secretly flew to Syria last December after her husband, Tyler Casey, was allegedly recruited by Hamdi Alqudsi. Ms Karroum and Casey were shot dead in mid-January in the northern Syrian town of Aleppo . Alleged mastermind: Hamdi Alqudsi (pictured on Tuesday after appearing briefly in the Downing Centre Local Court in central Sydney) is, police claim, the chief recruiter in Australia of young men who want to go and fight in Syria against government forces with groups such as the extremists in ISIS . ISIS leader Baryalei left Australia on April 10 last year on a flight to Tokyo. At 1am on June 22 last year federal police intercepted a call between Baryalei and Alqudsi, in which Baryalei explains he 'just got back yesterday after fighting a battle where five brothers were killed and a lot of brothers were injured'. 'They were trying to take a large stronghold, however they encountered difficulties due to a sniper wiping everyone out' Baryalei was himself nearly killed 'as a bullet came so close to him that his ears were ringing from the noise of the bullet'. Baryalei said he had watched a 'commander die right in front of his eyes' and described his fighters taking out two to three tanks. Death in Syria: Hamdi Alqudsi is accused of recruiting Tyler Casey (above, left), originally from Redcliffe, Queensland and former Australian infantry soldier, 22-year-old Caner Temel (right) to Syria where they were both killed in January, Temel shot in the head by a sniper, and Casey and his wife, Amira Karroum were reportedly lined up, shot, and their bodies dismembered . Soccer nut: Mehmet Biber, a 21-year-old Turkish-Australian from Merrylands, Sydney, who loved poetry and soccer, became radicalised and was then recruited allegedly by Hamdi Alqudsi and crossed the Turkish border into Syria, from where he has posted photographs of bloodied aid workers injured in fighting . On June 25 last year at 9.05pm, police intercepted another call in which Alqudsi in Sydney told Baryalei in Syria, 'four brothers coming this week, they are leaving Australia, going to try and get them by the weekend'. Alqudsi named them as Abu Qaqa, 'the tall one' (Tyler Casey), Abu Moussa (Caner Temel) and Biber's 'best friend', Abu Abdul Malik (Mehmet Biber) and Abu Islam ' the Sudanese brother'. 'They are ready,' Alqudsi told Baryalei. 'They are going to all meet in Istanbul then they are going to come all the way to Hatay [the southern province of Turkey which borders Syria] so you need to let me know if you want to pick them up from Hatay airport or do you want them to go to a particular hotel.' Alqudsi said 'the brothers' were 'crying, affected, none of them wanted to stay in this country one second. They are ready.' Alqudsi said the men would pay cash for the trip, with one of them giving $4000 and $2000. Arrested boarding a plane: New Zealand-born Amin Mohamed (above), 23, from Lidcombe in Sydney's inner west, allegedly bought a mobile phone in a false name and made plans to travel to Syria via Turkey with Alqudsi's help. He was arrested while trying to board a plane in Brisbane last December and charged with preparing to engage in foreign hostile activities . Dawn raid: Hamdi Alqudsi was arrested last December at this four bedroom house (pictured) at St Helens Park in far south-western Sydney where he had been living quietly with his family. Police allege he was helping young Australians to go and fight in Syria . Dangerous company: Renamed Yusf Ali and preaching (above) on Sydney streets, Tyler Casey was recruited, police allege, by Sydney suburban father and disability pensioner, Hamdi Alqudsi, and sent to Syria where he was shot and killed in the northern city of Aleppo within weeks of arriving . Road to death: Tyler Casey, who took the Jihadi name Yusuf Ali, joined the Street Dawah project where he met recruitment middleman Mohamed Ali Baryalei and took Islam to Sydney streets (pictured, left) before flying to Syria with his wife, Amira Karroum, and dying in a rebel incursion. Casey is pictured (right) with his mother, Kristine Hunt . Dead or alive? Mohamed Baryalei, a former Sydney bouncer and actor now believed to have died in Syria, is pictured (above) in Sydney in 2012, when he was a street preacher for his brand of Islam . On June 29, 2013 police intercepted a call at 5.59pm from Baryalei in Syria in which he told Alqudsi he had no intention of returning to Australia and he wanted to be a 'Shaheed' - an honor for Muslims who lay down their life for their religion or die fighting defending their faith. He said if he did this, he would leave his wife in Turkey as he did not wish to take her into Syria. Alqudsi said he was sending over another Australian recruit to Syria, Muhammed Abdul-Karim Musleh. At 7.17pm on the same evening, Alqudsi called Baryalei's phone and spoke to a man called Khatab, from the Al Nusra front and they promised to Skype each other. The next morning at 6.32am, Alqudsi called a different phone of Baryalei's, in which the latter said the extremist group he was associated with had split into two groups, Jabhat al Nusra and Dawla Islamieh who were 'mujahadeens as well man' and he wanted to join the second group. Australian Federal Police say the second group is a branch of Al Qaida. At 5.25pm on July 2 last year, Tyler Casey and Caner Temel called Alqudsi from Turkey saying the 'boys' had just arrived, the trip was good and they would soon fly south to Hatay. Alqudsi told them what hotel to stay in, instructed them to stay out of sight, buy a new SIM card and change their money into Turkish, Syrian and American currency. Alqudsi told the young men Baryalei would be waiting for them and to keep him updated. At 3.39pm on July 3, Alqudsi spoke with Muhammed Musleh who said they were about to board a plane for Hatay. Aqudsi said Baryalei had already left the international border crossing between Syria and Turkey at Bab al-Hawa to pick them up. Alqudsi has now been ordered to stand trial on seven charges of recruiting young men to fight with terrorist forces in Syria.

Quade, 23, said he tried to stay calm and just keep moving when the insults began. 'I didn't want to like freak out on . them,' he told the local news station. 'I was trying to . gain a little more knowledge about the situation and before we could . even do that, it was just bam bam.' He said everything happened so quickly when the gang attacked him, that he doesn't even have a clear picture in his mind of the fight. All is calm: Ellis Square in Savannah, the scene of the vicious attack, is a serene and quiet gathering place . Come together: The urban plaza is a popular tourist attraction and spot where Savannah residents enjoy concerts and performances . The next thing he remembered was waking up in an ambulance. 'He was basically left for dead,' Bakre said of the terrifying ordeal. 'I was trying to pry them off and before I knew it he was on the floor. It happened all so quickly,' she added. Bakre insisted that the couple did . nothing to provoke the brawl and is confident that the pair's racial . difference is what motivated the confrontation.

Vicious: The girlfriend, Olufisayo Bakre, said she tried to pry the three assailants off her boyfriend as they brutally beat him . 'Definitely, it's that simple,' she . said, with Quade adding that there just wasn't 'any logical reason they . would have to just go all out like that.' Bakre said that being an interracial . couple in the U.S. South has come with its challenges but nothing that . has ever escalated to this kind of violence. 'The worst we'll get will be a stare or like a snicker here or there but not physical contact,' she said. Let justice roll down: Olufisayo Bakre said she hopes justice will prevail in the situation . Police are now investigating and searching for the perpetrators. They are reviewing surveillance video . of the clash but say the footage is grainy and the cameras were located . far away from the incident, so it is difficult to make out the faces of . the assailants.

"An entertainment industry union has attacked the global beauty pageant Miss World after it was revealed its make-up artists will go unpaid. Contestants began arriving in London yesterday for the competition, with events starting tomorrow, amid complaints that qualified artists would have to work for just a 'goody bag'. Union BECTU waded into the debate after an email invitation was distributed to the make-up artist community by Colin Lapham, whose company ADCreativ won the beauty services contract. Make-up artists at this year's Miss World competition in London will go unpaid and work for 'credits' to their name and a goody bag. Pictured, Rosanna Davidson, from Ireland who was crowned Miss World in 2003 . It asked for 30 volunteers and was received by established make-up artists as well as graduates, claiming that the benefit to participants would be for 'credits' to their name. 'There are 130 contestants all with equal billing! They all need star quality hair and make-up with quick changes through the programme,' it said. 'There are also some build up events that require cover but in much smaller numbers. Everything is being filmed or photographed. 'Everything is credits only. We ar [sic] not receiving any fees for this. We are organising this for the credits. There will be goody bags.' But union communications officer, Sharon Elliott, said: 'The sense of outrage from qualified make-up artists wanting to make a living was palpable. 'From BECTU's point of view, a view clearly shared by many hair/make-up artists, this invitation communicates an intention to break the law on the National Minimum Wage. An entertainment industry union, BECTU, has attacked the Miss World Organisation and said it communicates an 'intention to break the law on National Minimum Wage' 'In the UK, the law provides for all work to be paid, at least in line with the minimum rates. Not surprisingly, goody bags and credits don't count as pay.' She added: ‘New and established make-up artists have to work really hard to earn a living in a very competitive sector. They need to be supported not exploited. Offers of work should be for paid work. 'Current hair and make-up students should be backing this position too as otherwise next year, and the year after that, they too will find themselves struggling to earn a living as they are forced to compete against invitations to work for free. 'Work experience, as an accepted part of a course of study can be done unpaid within limitations, however, it's plain that the invitation to work on the Miss World contest is just that, work.' Megan Young, from the Philippines, was crowned Miss World 2013, in Bali, Indonesia . She added that the national minimum wage is also not the 'going rate' for qualified artists and in film and TV these skills command around £200 to £300 a day on seniority, genre and scale of production. The union will be raising the issue with HM Revenue & Customs, which monitors employers conduct, and advising members on how they can seek payment. 'For now, we congratulate the make-up artists prepared to make a stand against exploitation and we invite many more in the creative sectors to stand with them,' she said. Established make-up artist and beauty blogger, Mariam Jensen, told MailOnline: 'It's not acceptable. 'We have bills to pay and families to feed and we have been fighting for a long time for recognition for our work. 'Credits don't cover our travel, our kit, our products - which can all cost thousands. It's insulting. 'For new artists we need to be clear that this is not how the industry works - especially in TV jobs. And if students are going to be doing it that's more worrying.' But Mr Laphan claims they have been oversubscribed and received 320 applications for the job. He denied accusations of exploitation and told The Independent: 'We do things for credits all the time; it's the norm.' Mr Laphan also said it will provide invaluable exposure and has been shocked by the response of his fellow professionals and added that his company was receiving no money. 'Having Miss World on my CV is more important than money,' he said. A spokesman for the Miss World Organisation told MailOnline: 'The people engaged are an outside company who will be working with us on special occasions. 'We do not have any dealings with their choice of beautician/hairdressers and have absolutely nothing to do with their payments.' The Grand Final of Miss World 2014 will be held at the ExCel Centre in London next month.","Complaints made by several make-up artists after revelations came to light .

"On his first night in North Korea, government officials were already telling Matthew Miller to get out. 'We want you to leave on the next flight,' he says he was told after his arrival, but the 25-year-old California native refused, sticking to what he claims was his plan to see what conditions were really like as a prisoner in Pyonyang. 'My main fear was that they would not arrest me when I arrived,' Miller told Washington-based NK News after he his release earlier this month, helped along by a visit to North Korea from US Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. Though outlets such as the Washington Post later speculated that Miller was being used as a 'bargaining chip' in negotiations with the US, North Korea was originally hesitant to take him. Scroll down for video . Released: Matthew Miller, 25, is welcomed back at Joint Base Lewis-McChord in Washington after his release from detention in North Korea . After arriving in the country in April with an intentionally damaged visa, Miller says he stayed in the Yanggakdo International Hotel for two weeks as government officials continued to urge him to leave. It wasn't until his third week in the country when Miller was moved to anything resembling detention, being taken first to a 'guest house,' the same location as another American prisoner, Kenneth Bae. But in spite of being held for 210 days in custody, Miller was treated to a rather welcoming reception in North Korea as American officials worked out his release. 'This might sound strange, but I was prepared for the ‘torture’ but instead of that I was killed with kindness, and with that my mind folded and the plan fell apart,' he said. Miller said he was allowed to hold on to his iPad and iPhone for 'at least a month' after his arrival, though communication was restricted. While Bae, who was accused of plotting to overthrow the North Korean government, faced conditions that were described as 'hard labor,' Miller says he still had access to certain comforts. Prisoner: Miller explained his greatest fear was not being arrested after entering North Korea pretending to be a tourist and intentionally damaging his visa . 'I became very friendly with my translator,' Miller said. 'We met everyday and would have conversations. We would play billiards together.' On trial: Miller was charged with 'hostile acts' against the Democratic People's Republic of North Korea and sentenced to six years hard labor in September . Hard labor: Miller described speaking with his translator and playing billiards during early parts of his trip to North Korea, though he was eventually moved to a detention facility, where he was ordered to move stones . In September, he was formally convicted of 'hostile acts' against the country entering 'under the guise of a tourist' and sentenced to six years of hard labor and sent to a detention facility on the outskirts of the capital. 'It was kind of a farm place,' Miller said. 'They had all control. I would go out to work to move stones, take out weeds.' The American's experience in custody contrast sharply with reports from defected North Korean prisoners, who have reported being severely beaten or forced into stress positions, according to The Atlantic. Media accounts of Miller have struggled to clarify his story, which has been further muddled by Miller's own attempts to conceal his identity. A fuller picture of the American detainee emerged after a Reuters investigation was published in September. Before his detention, the outlet revealed, Miller spent months in South Korea posing as an Englishman named Preston Sommerset. During that time, he recruited and paid artists to produce an anime adaptation of Alice in Wonderland before entering North Korea through China. Miller also described writings in his notebook, which were circulated in state media, as crafted to convince government officials to arrest him. In them, Miller portrayed himself as a hacker with ties to WikiLeaks and referenced plans 'to remove the American military from South Korea.' 'Perhaps the notebook was a little too much over the top,' Miller later said. 'They instantly knew it was false and wanted to know my true purpose of visiting.' After twice canceling trips by US special envoy for North Korea Robert King, Pyongyang negotiated Bae and Miller's release through Clapper last week. Miller claims the trip was a personal success, allowing him the opportunity to glimpse what life is like for North Koreans, though he says he understands at what price it came. 'I wanted to meet North Korean people face to face in a way that a normal tour would not be enough,' Miller said. 'I spent a good five months having many conversations with various people.' 'My trip has probably resulted in no change for anyone, except for me. I do feel guilt for the crime. It was a crime,' he said. 'I wasted a lot of time of the North Koreans and the Americans, of all of the officials who spent time with my case.'","Matthew Miller, 25, went to North Korea in April to get himself arrested .

"Nigeria holds the prize for an eccentric presidential name but move over Goodluck Jonathan, you can also meet Suffering or chat with Chinese in the heart of Africa. The Democratic Republic of Congo abounds in quirky names coined by mixing common nouns, adjectives and religious fervour into a fresh shortened moniker. Christian first names have long been used in this francophone country and continued after independence from Belgium in 1960. Young men check their names against the list of registered voters at a polling station in the Democratic Republic of Congo which abounds in quirky names coined by mixing common nouns, adjectives and religious fervour into a fresh shortened moniker . In the 1970s, the custom carried on undercover even after former dictator Mobutu Sese Seko (1965 to 1997) launched a drive to restore African names. But next to all the secret Maries, Josephs and Pierres, newborns were turning up with decidedly Christian - if unrecognisable - sobriquets. Take Plamedi for example. It stands for 'Plan merveilleux de Dieu' or God's marvellous plan. Then there is Merdi for 'Merci Dieu ou Merveille de Dieu' meaning Thank God or God's marvel. These are often popular when couples have had trouble conceiving and, after a mix of prayers and medical treatment, finally have a baby, said Olivier Kana, a doctor at the Monkole maternity hospital in Kinshasa. The proliferation of Pentecostal Christian churches in the Democratic Republic of Congo, as in other parts of Africa, has helped boost the trend. Their evangelical energy tends to be more exuberant than the traditional Catholicism - the church of 40 per cent of the 70 million Congolese -brought in by the Belgians. As elsewhere in Africa, the Congolese sometimes name their offspring after presidents or their employers - often hoping to gain favour - or even their profession. Nouns like Budget, Verdict, Jeunesse (Youth) and Plante (Plant) as well as adjectives, often of the superlative kind, are also big. Therese, a 34-year-old housewife, had no doubt about what to name her twin boys when they were born three years ago. 'They're called Precious and Sublime. They are precious for me and I hope they will also be precious to society,' she said. Regional variations have also been noticed, including one specific to the east of the country where for the last 20 years conflict has erupted among armed groups from local areas or nearby countries over ethnic, economic or border disputes. 'Your name can cause you problems or save your life,' said Justin Paluku, a doctor at the Heal Africa hospital in Goma, capital of the strife-torn Nord Kivu province. 'People have gotten used to no longer using tribal names to hide the real identity of their child,' he said. According to the law, names have to bear a 'link to Congolese cultural heritage, cannot be contrary to good morals or be in any way insulting, humiliating or provocative.' Many are named in the local language after powerful animals, such as Lion or Leopard, but other variants include the tamer Pigeon and Poodle. In the Democratic Republic of Congo next to all the secret Maries, Josephs and Pierres are, newborns with decidedly Christian - if unrecognisable - names like Plamedi which stands for 'Plan merveilleux de Dieu' or God's marvellous plan . Some names, people believe, mark the fate of individuals for life. Ferdinand, a resident of the eastern city of Goma, cites the case of a man baptised Mateso or Suffering in Swahili. 'According to those close to him, his name has been the root of all the misfortunes that have befallen his family,' the 29-year-old Ferdinand said. These include his unwed daughters' pregnancies, his good-for-nothing sons, his rocky employment history and the fact that his house was burnt to the ground. If it proves unduly troublesome, people can change their registered names 'but often reverence for one's parents prevents them from doing so,' said Richard Bondo, a lawyer in Kinshasa. For 28-year-old Chinois, or Chinese in French, an unusual name has become a source of pride. Named thus because his family found he bore a resemblance to Chinese workers building a bridge near his native village, the journalist - now based in Kinshasa - was rebaptised Bienvenu or 'Welcome' in French by a local radio station on the grounds that his real name would sound bizarre on the airwaves. But he is unfazed by the jokes and the snide remarks that often follow whenever he is introduced to people. 'I show them my voter's card and say - I am the sole Chinese in the Democratic Republic of Congo!' he said.","The Democratic Republic of Congo abounds in bizarre names .

"Ed Miliband tried to end Labour’s disastrous ‘elitism’ row yesterday by insisting he admires the working classes. Ukip’s second poll victory over the Tories had been eclipsed by a Labour frontbencher apparently sneering at a white van driver whose modest home is decked with England flags. Mr Miliband bizarrely declared he felt ‘respect’ on seeing a white van and insisted it was right for Emily Thornberry to resign over her tweet. Scroll down for video . Laughing in the face of disaster: Ed Miliband grins as he leaves his house in Gospel Oak, North London, yesterday despite claims he was 'furious' after hearing about Miss Thornberry's tweet . But his desperate intervention failed to calm Labour Party turmoil. Some of his MPs said Miss Thornberry’s gaffe was ‘horrendous’ while others claimed he was playing into Tory hands by asking her to quit. On a dramatic day at Westminster: . The furore over Miss Thornberry, MP for Islington South and Finsbury, erupted after she tweeted the picture of Daniel Ware’s home while campaigning in Rochester. When accused of sneering, she claimed she had ‘never seen anything like’ the house and said her critics were prejudiced against Islington, which has become a byword for champagne socialism. But Mr Miliband was said to have exploded in fury when he heard about Miss Thornberry’s tweet, first ordering her to apologise and later telling her to stand down as shadow attorney general. Gaffe: Emily Thornberry, the MP for upmarket Islington South and Finsbury, tweeted this image from Rochester yesterday leading to accusations of snobbery . Dan Ware turned up at Ms Thornbury's £3million home in Islington and accused her of being a 'snob' Labour strategists had hoped a Ukip landslide in Rochester would mark the moment that pressure switched on to Mr Cameron and away from Mr Miliband, who has endured weeks of speculation about his leadership. But with Ukip’s win narrower than expected, a result likely to deter further potential defectors who want to keep their Commons seats after next May’ s election, there was little sign of Tory disunity. Instead, Labour was riven over whether Mr Miliband’s treatment of Miss Thornberry had been over the top and how it should counter the threat to its working-class vote from Ukip. Her treatment was particularly brutal, given that she was the first MP to nominate him for the party leadership. However aides said Mr Miliband was ‘angrier than he has ever been’. Humiliated: While Miss Thornberry initially apologised over the picture, she stood down as Shadow Attorney General just hours later after speaking with a 'furious' Ed Miliband . Some senior figures privately accused the Labour leader of overreacting because of his own sensitivity about accusations made earlier this month in the traditionally supportive New Statesman magazine that he is an ‘old-style Hampstead socialist’. ‘Ed’s abandoned an ally when his enemies have survived far worse,’ one source said. Miss Thornberry said: ‘I made a mistake, I’ve resigned and if I’ve upset anyone or insulted anyone I apologise.’ Mr Miliband insisted: ‘I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect. 'That’s not my view, that’s not Labour’s view, it’s wrong, it never will be our view, and that is why I think it is right that she resigned.’ Asked what he thought when he sees a white van outside a house, Mr Miliband replied: ‘What is going through my mind is respect. 'Respect is the basic rule of politics and I’m afraid her tweet conveyed a sense of disrespect. There is nothing unusual or odd, as her tweet implied, with having an England flag in your window.’ Mr Cameron said: ‘Emily Thornberry is one of Ed Miliband’s closest allies and aides. Effectively what this means is that Ed Miliband’s Labour Party sneers at people who work hard, who are patriotic and who love their country.’ Mr Farage said Labour voters looking at the party’s leadership would not recognise them as ‘members of their own tribe’. Labour MP John Mann said: ‘It was horrendous. It insults people like me, it insults the people I know – my friends and family – Labour voters across the country because white vans, England flags, they’re Labour values.’ Ian Austin, a former Labour frontbencher, said: ‘Lots of people around the country suspect the country is run or politics is run by an out-of-touch metropolitan elite that doesn’t understand anything about their lives, doesn’t understand the pressure they’re under, doesn’t care about their concerns, and sneers at them.’ But Labour’s Alan Johnson said he did not think Miss Thornberry should have quit: ‘She’s not a stranger to council housing – it’s where she comes from. It doesn’t sound to me like a resignation scandal.’ Though it held the seat for 13 years until 2010, Labour put little effort into the contest in Rochester, triggered by the defection to Ukip of former Conservative MP Mark Reckless, who won it for his new party.","Labour MPs split after Miliband orders Emily Thornberry to stand down .

"A Christmas tree decorated with dozens of garish bows and ribbons has been branded a 'monstrosity' by furious residents who claim it is ruining the town's upmarket vibe.

James Vincent, a lifelong Bradford resident, said: 'I have never seen anything like it. 'There has always been a Christmas tree in Westbury Gardens and I believed that they wanted everyone to have white lights in the town.' Other disgruntled residents voiced their anger on local websites. One said: 'I am lucky enough to work in this delightful, quintessentially British town and when I saw the tree earlier this week, I could not believe how ghastly it looks and totally out of place.

He added that, when the club was in charge of the decorations, it had followed advice from Chamber of Commerce businesses to adorn trees with white lights. Despite the criticism, Mr Allen, who was asked to decorate the tree by the town's mayor John Potter, remains defiant. He spent a day-and-a-half working on the tree and said 'a look' just popped into his head and he worked from there. He added: 'We were sort of fighting against the light to finish the decorations on the top on Sunday but so far we have had a lot of positive comments because it is a bit in your face. 'I think some people will love it and I don't mind if some people hate it.'

"David Cameron is planning new powers to muzzle Islamic hate preachers accused of provoking terrorist outrages such as the killing of soldier Lee Rigby. The Prime Minister wants to stop extremist clerics using schools, colleges, prisons and mosques to spread their ‘poison’ and is to head a new Tackling Extremism and Radicalisation Task Force (TERFOR) made up of senior Ministers, MI5, police and moderate religious leaders. The high-powered group will study a number of measures, including banning extremist clerics from being given public platforms to incite students, prisoners and other followers – and forcing mosque leaders to answer for ‘hate preachers’. Islamist preacher Omar Bakri praised Michael Adebolajo for remaining at the murder scene . How has the government dealt with the Woolwich terror killing . It will also urge Muslim ‘whistleblowers’ to report clerics who act as terrorist apologists to the police.The launch of TERFOR signals a major overhaul of the Government’s counter-terrorism strategy in the wake of the brutal murder of Drummer Rigby on Wednesday. A senior Whitehall source said: ‘The PM is determined to challenge the poisonous narrative of extremist clerics and confront religious leaders who promote violence.’The move comes as: . Career: Drummer Rigby, 25, known as 'Riggers', was known as a brave soldier . The Government, police and security services and religious and  ethnic leaders have all struggled to come to terms with the Woolwich outrage. Government insiders say Mr Cameron’s new TERFOR group is intended to ‘disrupt’ the activities of extremist clerics wherever they preach their ‘hateful message’. One said: ‘We are looking at  the . range of powers and current methods of dealing with extremism at its . root, as opposed to just tackling criminal violent extremism. ‘And we will look at ways of disrupting individuals who may be influential in fostering extremism. ‘We . cannot allow a situation to continue where extremist clerics go around . this country inciting young people to commit terrorist acts. ‘We will do everything we can to stop it.’ The . source stressed that Mr Cameron was ‘aware of the importance of . avoiding a kneejerk reaction,’ and added: ‘This new group will study the . issue in great depth  before acting. ‘There . is no question of restricting freedom of speech – this is about . preventing people spreading the message of extremism and radicalisation . in a totally irresponsible  and reckless way. ‘We . cannot stand by and let people whip up violent hatred of Britain and . its values and culture with  the appalling consequences that we have . seen.’ Rant: A man identified as Michael Adebolajo, 28, . brandishes a meat cleaver with bloodied hands near the scene of the . killing .

Mr Cameron . will also ask police and security chiefs for more details on the number . of young  people who have been radicalised like Drummer Rigby’s . murderers. ‘It is hard . to measure the extent of radicalisation but we know there are many . hundreds of individuals,’ said one source.

"NHS managers are refusing to let GPs send patients for vital scans to detect cancer. Family doctors are meant to be allowed to refer patients directly for tests and X-rays without having to first go to a hospital specialist, as part of a government drive to speed up diagnosis. But an investigation has found that two-thirds of NHS organisations do not allow GPs to send patients for at least one of four crucial scans to spot cancers with low survival rates. Of these two thirds, 50 per cent do not allow doctors to send patients directly for scans to detect bowel cancer, while 50 per cent do not allow doctors to send patients for scans to detect brain cancer. GP patients face a ""postcode lottery"" due to restrictions imposed by some clinical commissioning groups, the research found . Some 27 per cent do not give them direct access to checks for ovarian cancer, while 25 per cent do not let them send patients for chest X-rays for lung cancer, which is often diagnosed too late. Britain has one of the worst cancer survival rates in Western Europe and in 2011 the Government pledged to improve this by investing £450million to give GPs better access to scans. These included MRI scans for brain cancer, chest X-rays for lung cancer, flexible sigmoidoscopy tests for bowel cancer and ultrasounds for ovarian cancer. Politicians stated that GPs would be allowed to order these tests to be carried out themselves – rather than having to send patients first to a hospital consultant – in the hope of speeding up diagnosis time by several weeks. However, Freedom of Information requests by GP magazine found that only a third give doctors direct access to all four scans. In fact, a fifth of the 211 GP-run Clinical Commissioning Groups do not let them refer patients for any of these tests. Dr Richard Vautrey, deputy chairman of the British Medical Association’s GP Committee, said: ‘It’s frustrating. There’s been an increase in pressure on what should be done within the community, but for GPs to be empowered to be able to do that, we need the support services and particularly access to diagnostics. ‘There’s no real reason other than cost that prohibits access to services. But in many cases, it actually reduces costs overall if you enable GPs to have greater access to these types of services, because they can avoid making potentially unnecessary referrals.’ Earlier this week the NHS watchdog Nice issued detailed guidance to GPs on diagnosing cancer over concerns that failure to spot the disease early enough are costing thousands of lives a year. Family doctors are meant to be allowed to refer patients directly for tests and  scans, such as an MRI, without having to first go to a hospital specialist (file picture) It told doctors to refer patients for tests within 48 hours if they had symptoms including persistent tiredness, a cough or unexplained bruising. Last month it emerged that the chances of beating cancer in England still lag behind those elsewhere in Europe. Data from the Office for National Statistics shows that in 2012 the percentage of patients still alive five years after diagnosis had improved for 19 of the most common cancers, compared to the situation in 2011. But for five types they stalled or got worse, including bladder cancer in women, thyroid cancer in both sexes, testicular cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma in women and mesothelioma in men. There is no explanation as to why – and in all cases it has only been a very small decline. However, waiting times for vital tests to diagnose cancer have gone up recently as the NHS struggles with the rise in patients. Campaigners said that, despite overall improvement, England is well behind France, Germany and Scandinavia in its survival rates.

"A man has been arrested for the second time in three months for having sex with a horse called Nadia he is believed to be obsessed with. Cirilo Castillo, 43, from Texas, was arrested again this week after the owners of the horse set up surveillance video in her corral after they found a 'mysterious bucket'. They believed it was Castillo because he had repeatedly went after the mare in the past. Once they saw him on the surveillance tape, they called Hidalgo County sheriff's department. Unhealthy obsession: Cirilo Castillo was just released from prison in April for having sex with the same horse and was rearrested this week . Sheriff Lupe Trevino told the Houston Chronicle: 'We have a hell of a surveillance tape. It is not going to go to America’s Funniest Videos . that is for sure.' Castillo is a laborer and has prior arrests for theft and marijuana possession. He was released from jail in April for charges relating to the last time he had sex with Nadia. But he was also arrested in January 2012 for having sex with two different horses on two different ranches. It is not known if one of the mares was Nadia. There is no law against bestiality in Texas, so Castillo can only be charged with trespassing and possibly cruelty to animals - if they can prove Nadia was hurt during the sexual encounter. Sheriff Trevino wants to help Castillo because he thinks he is a good guy with a problem. 'The guy is practically harmless, except for the horse,' he said. 'I can’t just ignore this and allow it . to keep happening. Maybe we can get him some help, whatever . we can do, we are going to try and do.' He said Nadia’s owner first realized Castillo was back prowling in the night after she found a 'mysterious bucket' in Nadia’s corral on a recent morning. Sheriff Lupe Trevino said: 'We have a hell of a surveillance tape. It is not going to go to America¿s Funniest Videos that is for sure'","Cirilo Castillo was just released from jail in April for charges relating to having sex with Nadia the horse .

"The impact of a six-mile long . asteroid believed to have hit the earth and wiped out the dinosaurs 66 . million years ago would have sparked a cataclysmic firestorm, scientists . say. Over the past three decades . scientists have argued about what caused the extinction 66 million years . ago - changes to climate, volcano activity or an asteroid. Research has already shown that the . prehistoric animals died out around the same time a six-mile long object . hit the planet, and a new model of the disaster suggests the asteroid's . impact would have sent vaporised particles of rock high above Earth's . atmosphere which in turn would have turned the sky bright red as they . heated the upper atmosphere to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit on re-entry. Cosmic explosion: An asteroid hitting the planet sounded the death knell of dinosaurs . A team from the Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental . Sciences have come up with a model of the disaster that shows how the . asteroid's impact heated up the Earth's atmosphere to levels that would . have incinerated anything not underground or underwater. (Impression of dinosaurs feeding) 'It's likely that the total amount of infrared heat was equal to a 1 . megaton bomb exploding every four miles over the entire Earth,' study . researcher Douglas Robertson, of the Cooperative Institute for Research . in Environmental Sciences, or CIRES, said in a statement reported in LiveScience.com. To put this into perspective, a 1-megaton hydrogen bomb is said to be the . equivalent of 80 Hiroshima-type nuclear bombs. The model, detailed this week in the Journal of Geophysical . Research-Biogeosciences shows how the 'heat pulse' would have incinerated the world's forests and everything else not . protected underground or underwater. The global firestorm theory has been aired before, with some scientists . claiming that much of the intense radiation would have been shielded from Earth by the falling rock. Factoring in this heat reduction, Roberts and his team maintain the . atmosphere would still have been hot enough to ignite the world's . forests. The team's claim is bolstered by evidence of a layer of soot at the Earth's 65 million-year-old Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary which would be consistent with global fires. Some scientists argue that the charcoal's presence is in fact from the impact of the asteroid itself - an argument countered by Robertson who says the asteroid alone would not have created quite this much. End of the dinosaur age: A depiction of a Tyrannosaur as the asteroid strikes . 'Our data show the conditions back then are consistent with widespread . fires across the planet,' said Robertson. 'Those conditions resulted in . 100 per cent extinction rates for about 80 percent of all life on Earth.' The asteroid's impact  near the town of Chicxulub . in Mexico left a crater more than . 110 miles (180 kilometers) wide. The explosion itself would have released as much energy as 100 . trillion tons of TNT, more than a billion times more than the atom . bombs that destroyed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. While . the impact may not have been the sole cause of the dinosaur extinction, . it almost definitely dealt the death blow, said researchers in February at Berkeley University's Geochronology Centre in California. Director Paul Renne said: 'We have shown that these events are synchronous to within a gnat’s eyebrow. 'Therefore the impact clearly played a major role in extinctions, but it probably wasn’t just the impact. The impact was clearly the final straw that pushed Earth past the tipping point.' The asteroid collision with Earth has now been dated to 66,038,000 years ago. The new extinction date is precise to within 11,000 years. Before the cosmic explosion, many creatures . were brought to the brink of extinction by dramatic climate swings in the . preceding million years, including long cold snaps. Researchers used . high-precision radiometric dating analysis of debris kicked up by the . impact which would have radioactive materials within them. The . extinction of the dinosaurs was first linked to a comet or asteroid . impact in 1980 by the late UC Berkeley Nobel Laureate Luis Alvarez and . his son, Walter, who is a UC Berkeley professor emeritus of earth and . planetary science. The Colorado researchers maintain that the conditions resulted in . 100 per cent extinction rates for about 80 percent of all life on Earth .","New model of disaster suggests asteroid's impact would have heated atmosphere to 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit .

"Two Yazidi teenagers who escaped the clutches of Isis have revealed the full horror of their capture and captivity. They have described being tortured and forced to watch videos of men from their community being beheaded. Some, they said, were so traumatised by their experiences that they tried to commit suicide. However, those that tried to kill themselves were severely beaten by Isis fighters. Displaced people from the minority Yazidi sect, fleeing violence from forces loyal to the Islamic State in Sinjar town, walk towards the Syrian border. Two Yazidi teenagers who escaped the clutches of Isis have revealed the full horror of their capture and captivity . Yazidi teenager Sara, 15, said that she considered suicide many times after she was kidnapped by Isis. Her horrifying ordeal began in the Sinjar village of Tal Azir on August 3 when Isis fighters advanced towards them. Along with her mother, her brother and his pregnant wife, they fled towards the mountains, but Isis caught up with them at a remote farmhouse. The women were separated from the men – who were simply mown down by machine gun fire in one of the rooms. Sara was bundled onto a pick-up truck and taken to Mosul, where she was held with hundreds of others prior to being sold off. She told Globalpost.com reporter Tracey Shelton: 'We would try to make ourselves look ugly. Some women would cry or scream or fight, but it made no difference. They were always taken anyway. One girl hung herself. Another tried, but the IS guards stopped her and beat her very badly. No one else tried after that.' Sara, who described Isis fighters as 'dirty, with hairy faces and smelling bad' was eventually sold to 'an old man and a fat man'. She said that they would show her videos of Isis militants beheading her neighbors. A displaced family from the minority Yazidi sect. Two girls from that community  described being tortured and forced to watch videos of men from their community being beheaded after Isis captured them . She added: 'In some [videos] they put the heads into cooking pots. Sometimes they would stand on them. There were so many heads. And they would ask us, 'Do you know this one?' and laugh.' Sara, whose real name has been changed, recalled that she would sometimes have huge amounts of blood drawn from her arm by one of the men using a syringe, leaving her feeling sick and faint. Nineteen-year-old Leila's story is similarly disturbing. She described how her husband was shot dead by Isis, along with others from her village including boys of just 14, after trying to flee from her village in Sinjar. She was forced into the back of a pick-up truck and taken away, eventually driven to Mosul, like Sara. She said: 'We drove past so many bodies. Even the bodies of children.' Both girls eventually managed to escape, Leila before she was sold off, while militants slept, and Sara when her 'owners' were at Friday prayers. Kind-hearted locals risked their lives to help them get back to their relatives. Sara is now with family members in Erbil and Leila lives in Duhok. Islamic scholars have accused Islamic State, also known as Isis or Isil, of 'heinous war crimes' The Yazidi Fraternal Organization says that there are more than 12,000 missing Yazidis – 5,000 women and 7,000 men. It says that 49 have managed to escape from Isis, many having been raped and tortured at the hands of their captors. Recently over 120 Islamic scholars from . around the world, many of them leading Muslim voices in their . own countries, issued an open letter denouncing Isis militants and refuting their religious arguments. An array of Muslim leaders and groups have publicly rejected . the Islamist movement since it imposed its brutal rule over . large areas of Syria and Iraq this summer. Five Muslim nations . have also joined a U.S.-led military campaign against it. The 22-page letter, written in Arabic and heavy with quotes . from the Koran and other Islamic sources, is just as clear as . those groups in condemning the torture, murder and destruction . Islamic State militants have committed in areas they control. 'You have misinterpreted Islam into a religion of harshness, . brutality, torture and murder,' the letter said. 'This is a . great wrong and an offense to Islam, to Muslims and to the . entire world.' In the letter, the scholars not only denounced the killing . of U.S. journalists James Foley and Steven Sotloff and British . aid worker David Haines as murder, but also rejected it based on . the Muslim custom of protecting emissaries between groups. The letter described as 'heinous war crimes' several cases . of militants killing prisoners, totalling at least 2,850. To . stress this point in an Islamic way, it gave several quotes from . the Prophet Mohammad forbidding such practices. It said that Arab Christians and the Yazidis, followers of . an ancient religion derived from Zoroastrianism, were both . 'people of the book' meant under Islamic sharia law to be . protected.","Two teenage Yazidi girls have described the horror of being capture by Isis .

"BBC presenter Liz Kershaw claims her elderly mother was subjected to abuse during a hospital stay. She said that disinterested staff ‘doped’ the 80-year-old leaving her ‘cackling like a mad woman’. Miss Kershaw also claims that she was told to telephone back following a brain scan on her mother as a nurse was too busy eating toast. The radio DJ said that the treatment at Hull Royal Infirmary amounted to ‘elder abuse’. She also accused hospital staff of losing an emerald necklace worth £1,000. Radio presenter Liz Kershaw (left) has accused hospital staff of 'elder abuse' against her 80-year-old mother Eileen Pickup (right) after she claims she was given sedatives which caused her to cackle 'like a mad woman' Miss Kershaw described the treatment of her mother Eileen Pickup as ‘shocking’ and lambasted nurses for their uncompassionate approach. The 56-year-old said she was highlighting her mother’s experience as she no longer wants elderly people to fear going in to hospital. Mrs Pickup, who was a Labour councillor in Manchester for more than 50 years, was admitted to hospital in August last year after becoming violently ill while on holiday in Yorkshire. But when her concerned daughter phoned the hospital to inquire about her condition, the calls were repeatedly unanswered. On one occasion, Miss Kershaw asked to speak to a nurse and was told: ‘You’ll have to ring back. She’s just tucking in to her toast.’ When Miss Kershaw found her mother in a distressed state during a later visit, she asked a doctor: ‘Are you doping her like they do troublesome old people in homes to keep them quiet?’ The presenter, who is a patron of the charity Age UK, took notes documenting her mother’s stay and believes that she was treated unfairly because of her age. During one visit she noticed that her mother’s mental state had deteriorated significantly and found her in a ‘state of mania’. Yet when she asked a nurse about the change, she was allegedly told: ‘Well, wouldn’t you rather have her like that than when she’s the other way?’ Miss Kershaw believes her mother was incorrectly given sedatives. She has also demanded answers about what happened to her mother’s jewellery which she claims was missing when her mother was discharged. The Radio 6 Music DJ says staff at the Hull Royal Infirmary (pictured) gave her mother the sedatives unnecessarily. The trust has denied the allegations . Miss Kershaw, who presents a show on BBC Radio 6, said: ‘I would like the hospital to acknowledge my mother was subject to elder abuse. ‘I don’t want any older person to have to fear going into hospital.’ Bosses at Hull and East Yorkshire Hospitals NHS Trust have denied the allegations. Chief executive Chris Long said: ‘We are shocked by the allegations being made. We strongly refute the suggestion that she has been subject to abuse and I can assure Mrs Pickup and her family that patients in our care are only sedated when there is a clear medical need to do so. ‘A full and formal investigation has taken place into the care Mrs Pickup received. This concluded that there is no evidence... that sedation was unnecessarily provided.’","Radio 6 Music DJ lodged complaint over treatment at Hull Royal Infirmary .

"As the White House sews together a patchwork of agency responses to the Ebola epidemic, Sen. John McCain and other Republican lawmakers are demanding that President Obama appoint a single 'Ebola czar' to oversee the government's efforts to contain the virus. 'From spending time here in Arizona, my constituents are not comforted,' McCain, an Arizona Republican, said Sunday on CNN. 'There has to be more reassurance given to them. I would say we don't know exactly who's in charge. There has to be some kind of czar.' That represents a 180-degree turn from McCain's view in 2009, when he lambasted the administration for taking a 'czar' approach to everything from drugs and green jobs to the Great Lakes and California's water supply. 'Obama has more czars than the Romanovs – who ruled Russia for 3 centuries,' he tweeted during Obama's first year in office. 'Romanovs 18, cyberczar makes 20.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell participated in a conference call with CDC director Dr. Thomas Frieden on Monday as media and Congress alike wondered who's calling the shots . Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain insisted on Sunday that he would 'like to know who's in charge' of the White House's Ebola plan . Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director Dr. Thomas Frieden gave an Ebola briefing on Monday but offered little new information as America's first native Ebola victim was named publicly . From a distance: President Barack Obama spoke with his Health and Human Services secretary on Sunday but journalists were only allowed to photograph him from outside the Oval Office for about 40 seconds . The White House has described its Ebola efforts as a 'whole-government approach,' relying alternatively on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, the National Security Council, the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Departments of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services, and the Pentagon for strategic advice and tactical options. Obama took a Sunday conference call with HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell, who moved over from the White House budget director post in June and is seen as three-parts administrator, zero-parts public health expert. On Monday he will meet with 'senior members of his administration,' according to the White House, 'to receive an update on the Administration’s response to the Ebola case in Dallas and broader efforts to ensure the preparedness of our national health infrastructure.' He last convened that group a week ago. White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Oct. 6 that Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco is 'the point person here at the White House who is coordinating the interagency response to this effort.' 'But again,' he said in his next breath, 'it’s USAID that is the point on the ground.' The Department of Defense, Earnest added, is in charge of 'logistical infrastructure' in Liberia. And 'HHS and the Centers for Disease Control are the lead in communicating with state and local officials and with public health officials in states all across the country.' Reporters covering the White House can find it challenging to get answers. Members of Congress, Rep. Jack Kingston suggested Saturday, are in the same boat as constituents pepper them with questions in the final few weeks before Election Day. Abe's not the czar: Obama faces tough questions about how he's cobbling together an Ebola response without a single point-person to answer questions and move the ball forward . McCain wasn't always a fan of naming 'czars' – point-people – to consolidate the government's responses to a crisis . TALK SOUP: (left to right) US Africa Command commander Gen. David Rodriguez, Homeland Security adviser Lisa Monaco, USAID Administrator Raj Shah, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases director Dr. Anthony Fauci and HHS Secretary Sylvia Burwell all took their turns at the microphone on October 3 . Speaking to The Washington Examiner, he said that while he 'hate[s] to invoke the term ""czar"",' Obama needs a 'central office that’s a clearinghouse' helmed by 'a command and control general, a strategic guy.' Kingston doubled down in an interview with WBS-TV in Atlanta, saying that 'they need to have one person in charge, because you have about seven different federal agencies that are involved in this. We need to have a schematic saying who's responsible.' 'Czar' positions at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue are generally created inside the White House and given to unelected bureaucrats who don't report to cabinet agencies. That situation has historically made members of Congress uneasy and brought howls from whichever party is out of power. Kingston himself tried to defund all of Obama's czars in 2009 with a bill that gathered 123 so-cosponsors  – all Republicans – when Democrats controlled both houses of Congress. The legislation died in committee. The one federal government agency that might logically weigh in on Ebola – but hasn't – is the Office of the Surgeon General. That post is vacant. Obama nominated Dr. Vivek Murthy to fill it a year ago, but his statements in favor of doctors inquiring into their patients' gun ownership proved too toxic. Still, Rear Admiral Boris Lushniak is that acting surgeon general, and he's been silent. AWOL? Rear Adm. Boris Lushniak (left), the acting US Surgeon General, has focused on preventative public health like anti-obesity measures more than disease response efforts . Who's in charge? Leaders of 10 separate government agencies gathered to brief the president on Oct. 6 . Three other potential Ebola czars identified by Kansas Senator Jerry Moran and Virginia Rep. Frank Wolf, both Republicans, would all come from outside the Obama administration. In an Oct. 6 letter to the president, the two lawmakers suggested former Secretary of State Colin Powell, former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates or and Secretary of Health and Human Services Mike Leavitt. All three served under President George W. Bush. 'This requires a global response and the U.S. needs to provide the necessary leadership to control and eliminate this outbreak,' Maron and Wolf wrote. 'We believe it is imperative that you designate a single senior advisor who will be responsible for coordination all U.S. agencies and policies involving the international and domestic response to Ebola.'","White House has had a rotating cavalcade of experts from seven different agencies briefing Congress and the press on Ebola .

Former policewoman and Kings Cross stripper Kim Hollingsworth has been ordered to pay more than $100,000 in vet costs after she was convicted of starving her horses . The charges she faced included failing to provide proper and sufficient food and failure to provide veterinary treatment to four horses in three separate matters. RSPCA inspectors responded to a complaint regarding horses at a Brownlow Hill property, in Sydney's south-west, in August 2013.

"Concern: Diana Carney, Mark Carney's wife, says teabags are an environmental threat . Some environmental activists get worked up about rainforests. Others worry about the plight of polar bears or the perils of rising sea levels. But for Diana Fox Carney, an economist, green guru and wife of the new Governor of the Bank of England, the issue that gets her really, really hot under the collar is the humble tea bag. She describes the leaf-filled sachets as one of her ‘pet hates’ and says they are an environmental disaster. ‘Yes, they can be pretty, and convenient, but do we really need an extra 40 square cm of bleached and printed paper with every cup of tea?’ she writes on her blog, which reviews eco-friendly products. Her husband was hopefully too preoccupied with the huge challenges of his new job at Threadneedle Street which he started yesterday to worry unduly about the contents of the Bank of England tea urn. But for those millions who adore the convenience of the tea bag, it was enough to make us choke on our Tetley’s. So does Mrs Fox Carney have a point? And are tea bags really doing untold harm to the planet? THE SCALE OF THE TEA BAG MENACEThe tea bag was invented by accident more than 100 years ago by American merchant Thomas Sullivan, who decided to send samples of tea to customers in small silk pouches. Some people were confused — assuming that the bags were supposed to be dunked in hot water just like traditional metal tea infusers. When Sullivan heard what they were doing, he spotted a gap in the market. Thus, serendipitously, the tea bag was born. Environmental disaster?: Tea bags could be doing untold harm to the planet . At first, there were complaints that the mesh of the bags was too fine, so he replaced the silk with gauze. And as tea bags entered mass production, cheaper paper was used instead. At first, the British were reluctant to abandon loose leaf tea, but by the 1950s, when families were embracing new labour-saving gadgets like never before, tea bags took off. Bill Gorman, of the UK Tea Council, credits the tea bag with saving the tea industry. ‘We would not be drinking the volume of tea we do now without them,’ he says. ‘The UK is the second-largest tea market per person in the world. Ireland is first. Without tea bags, the industry would be on its knees.’ARE THEY A WASTE OF PAPER?Major brands such as PG Tips, Tetley and Typhoo no longer use wood pulp to make their paper, but a vegetable fibre derived from the abaca plant — a relative of the banana grown mostly in Indonesia and South America. However, we certainly use a lot of it. Enduring popularity: The UK is the second-largest tea market in the world, and Ireland is the first . According to the Tea Council, the British drink around 60 billion cups of tea every year. Around 96 per cent of those are made with tea bags. That means more than 55 billion tea bags are dunked, squeezed and tossed away each year in the UK alone. It adds up to a lot of paper, particularly when so many tea bags are no longer rectangular — the least wasteful design for a tea bag — but round or pyramid-shaped. A PG Tips pyramid bag, for instance, is made from a rectangle of perforated filter paper approximately 70 square cm. A traditional square tea bag, on the other hand, uses around 50 square cm of paper. So a tea lover who drinks five cups a day will get through 13 square metre of perforated paper each year. A couple living with two teenage children could get through 50 square metre of tea bag paper each year. It seems a lot, but not when put in perspective. According to a paper industry survey a few years ago, the typical Briton uses 80 to 90 rolls of loo paper each year. Meanwhile, the 50 square metre of tea bag paper we use is the equivalent of only around two or three rolls of quality loo paper. If you count all the paper, cardboard, packaging, papers and phone directories, the typical family uses the equivalent of six trees a year. The 50 sq m of thin bag paper pales in comparison.WHAT ABOUT BLEACH? Organic: Environmentally-friendly companies such as Clipper use  unbleached bags . Unless you buy from an environmentally-friendly company such as Clipper (which uses unbleached bags), most of us consume clean, white tea bags that are the result of intensive chemical processes. Once, the wood pulp or vegetable fibre used in tea bags was bleached with chlorine to make it white rather than an unappealing grey. However, bleaching attracted criticism from environmentalists because minute amounts of potentially toxic by-products such as dioxins and furans, chemicals which cause harm when ingested, could remain in the paper and could leak into a cup or mug. The industry always insisted that the levels of these chemicals were far too small to pose a health risk. But there were concerns that even tiny amounts could be linked to cancer, hormone disorders and developmental problems. Manufacturers have now replaced chlorine with chlorine dioxide — an agent that produces far fewer toxic by-products — or chlorine-free bleach in the past couple of decades. The industry and food regulators say levels are well within safe limits. THEY'RE INDESTRUCTIBLE! According to the Government’s waste body, Wrap, tea is the largest element of ‘avoidable food waste’ in our dustbins. Wrap estimates that British tea drinkers throw out 370,000 tonnes of tea bags and tea leaves each year along with vegetable peelings, onion skins and coffee grinds. Most of this ends up in landfill sites. Wrap says the environmental impact of tea bags could easily be reduced if people simply threw the bags on the compost heap or flower beds. But it’s not that simple. For while most of a tea bag is made from biodegradable paper, around 20 to 30 per cent is not. In order to stop tea bags bursting open in transit or in the cup, many are sealed with a strip of heat-resistant polypropylene plastic. That plastic doesn’t compost, even after a few years, and gardeners often find these small plastic meshes amid their home-made compost (along with those non-biodegradable stickers that are found on fresh fruit such as apples). Wrap insists that the small amount of plastic in a teabag won’t cause any harm to plants and can simply be picked out of the compost heap by hand. Wrap does, however, recommend that if you wish to speed up the composting process, you should rip open the bags. A STORM IN A TEACUP?For environmental groups such as Friends Of The Earth, Greenpeace and WWF, teabags are some way down their list of priorities. These charities certainly have concerns about the way forests are cleared to plant tea bushes, rivers and streams are diverted to irrigate plantations and the terrible working conditions of pickers. But their websites don’t have pages devoted to the PG Tips threat or calls to boycott the Tetley tea bag. With good reason. In a world where there are genuine environmental problems, anxieties about mostly compostable teabags are misplaced. Soothing: Prince Charles, and the rest of us, can continue to enjoy cups of tea with teabags, as they actually reduce waste compared to loose tea leaves . If you are concerned about anything when making your 4 o’clock cup of tea, worry about the cost and waste of putting too much water into kettles. The Government’s Energy Saving Trust worked out that two-thirds of people regularly overfill kettles when making tea. A single household could save £8 a year on their electricity bill by boiling only the water they needed. The savings from one week of careful filling would be enough to power a television for a day. And it would slash the UK’s greenhouse gas emissions. In fact, tea bags can actually reduce waste. Few people making a pot of loose leaf tea measure out the leaves precisely — and many use too much. Using a pre-filled bag eliminates that problem. So when eco-warriors start banging on about tea bags, the best advice is quietly slip out of the room and make yourself a nice, soothing cuppa.","Mark Carney's wife has criticised teabags as a waste of paper .

"The rain is back, the days are warm and pools of stagnant water are lying everywhere. For those enjoying balmy evenings outdoors, this means only one thing - Britain's mosquito bite season is officially under way. There are more than 3,500 different species of mosquito in the world and 33 in Britain. Of these, a mere handful feed on humans. Only the females bite, and even they are vegetarians most of the time, living off nectar from flowers. There are more than 3,500 different species of mosquito in the world and 33 in Britain. Of these, a mere handful feed on humans . But in order to produce and lay eggs, they need an extra boost of nutrients - and they get it from the blood of animals, including humans. In Britain we are lucky. Mozzies are little more than a nuisance - albeit a maddening one if the bites flare up. However, globally they are killers, spreading malaria, yellow fever, dengue fever and other deadly diseases. And when it comes to a good bloody meal, mozzies are much fussier than you might think. Women tend to suffer more than men because they tend to bare more flesh. But it's often said that some people attract mosquito bites, regardless of their sex, while others never get nipped. It used to be thought that this was an urban myth. But increasingly studies are showing that mosquitoes really do prefer some people to others. So what determines if you're one of the miserable tribe loved by the blighters - or one of the lucky few they ignore? It's often said that some people attract mosquito bites, regardless of their sex, while others never get nipped - and it used to be thought that this was an urban myth . CARBON DIOXIDE . Female mosquitoes use a range of techniques to find prey. But one of the most important is the presence of carbon dioxide - the invisible, odourless gas we breathe out. They use an organ called the maxillary palp to spot clouds of carbon dioxide before homing in on the source. This organ is so finely tuned that it can detect the gas from more than 160ft away. Larger people tend to have higher metabolic rates - they burn up more energy when their bodies are resting. This is because their bodies are bigger and more energy is needed to pump blood and keep moving. And because they are burning up more fuel all the time, they produce more carbon dioxide - a by-product of converting food into energy - than people with lower metabolic rates. This makes them more noticeable to mosquitoes. There is some evidence that people who are tall or fat are also at greater risk simply because they are bigger, according to a study by world mosquito expert Dr James Logan, published in the journal BioMed Central in 2010. Going for a big host is not a bad strategy for the mosquitoes as larger people have more surface area and more skin that’s likely to be exposed. Mosquitoes also seem to like higher body temperatures, and body temperature goes up when we exercise - another reason why you may be more prone to bites after a work-out . BODY ODOUR AND SWEAT . Mosquitoes appear to adore the smell of a hot, sweaty human. 'The reason they find some people more attractive than others is usually down to smell,’ says Dr Logan of the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. 'They hear and detect moisture and temperatures, but the sense of smell is most important and we all smell slightly different.’ Human bodies produce around 500 different volatile chemicals that waft off our skins into the air. Many of these can be detected by mosquitoes using a pair of tiny feathery antennae on their heads. Studies have shown the insects are attracted to sweat, lactic acid, uric acid and octenol. Lactic acid is released through pores in the skin, particularly after exercise. Uric acid is best known as a chemical in urine, but can also build up in the skin. Octenol is found in sweat and breath - so if you’re sweaty or breathing heavily, you’ll produce more, attracting mozzies. Some people naturally release more of these chemicals than others. If you exercise outside you tend to produce more lactic acid. Mosquitoes also seem to like higher body temperatures, and body temperature goes up when we exercise - another reason why you may be more prone to bites after a work-out. PREGNANCY . The reason they find some people more attractive than others is usually down to smell . Life isn’t fair for pregnant women. Not only do you get hot and tired, you are also more vulnerable to mosquito bites. Studies show that pregnant women are more attractive to mosquitoes, getting twice as many bites as non-pregnant women - for several possible reasons. Pregnancy raises the body temperature by about 1.3f and mosquitoes are attracted to warmer people. It can also make women sweat more. Pregnant women tend to breathe out more carbon dioxide, which attracts the insects. A women’s skin odour may change subtly during pregnancy too, influenced by hormonal changes in her body, and this change could make them smell sweeter to mozzies. ALCOHOL . In 2002, a Japanese study of 13 volunteers found that those who drank a single bottle of beer were more attractive to mosquitoes. The researchers believed drinking beer increases body temperature and the amount of alcohol in that is in a person’s sweat. Two years ago, a French study of 15 volunteers again found that beer drinkers were slightly more likely to get bitten. Researchers haven’t shown whether the effect is the same with wine or spirits, or whether an ingredient in beer aside from alcohol changes the smell of skin. SMELLY FEET . It’s not just the natural odour of skin that is responsible for attracting or deterring mosquitoes. Dutch researchers have found that the volume and nature of the bacteria that live naturally in our skin can make a difference too. A study published in the Public Library of Science journal in 2011 on African mosquitoes showed that people with large numbers of skin bacteria were more attractive to mosquitoes. However, there are hundreds of different species of skin bacteria, and people with a narrower variety of species tended to be more attractive to mosquitoes than those with a wide range. Other studies have shown that bad body odour and sweaty feet - conditions often caused by bacteria - also attract the insects. Malarial mosquitoes in tropical countries are particularly keen on smelly feet - those in the UK appear to be less so. One of the reasons mosquitoes seem to bite women more than men is that they tend to bare more flesh . NATURAL INSECT REPELLENT . Just as some people’s odour attracts mozzies, other people’s acts as a deterrent. Dr Logan’s team has shown that one in ten people has a natural smell that repels mosquitoes. Some of these natural repellents are substances called ketones - a large family of organic chemicals. Scientists are unsure why they are produced by the skin - or why some people produce more than others. In high doses, they smell like sickly sweet fruit. 'It’s almost as if some people have a natural repellent,’ says Dr Logan, who suspects that the trait may run in families. No one is sure why ketones deter the insects. Some experts suggest that higher concentrations may fool mosquitoes that the thing they are smelling is not a human. SOME PEOPLE FLARE UP . A lucky few claim that they are never bitten by mozzies - but scientists disagree. When people say that they never get bitten, what they usually mean is that they don’t react badly to insect bites. 'We have shown that there’s a link between the perception of being bitten and the reaction to a bite,’ says Dr Logan. Whether you flare up when nipped by a mosquito depends on your immune system response - and that response can change. If someone is bitten for the first time in their life, the bite rarely becomes inflamed. The second tends to flare up after a few days or a couple of weeks. After that, bites can turn nasty within hours. But studies have shown that people who have been bitten regularly over several months or years see their immune systems calm down to the point that the bites are be barely noticeable. It may not seem fair, but mosquitoes really like to bite pregnant women . BLOOD TYPE . Female mosquitoes are hungry for the proteins in our blood, and they appear to find some types of blood tastier than others. A Japanese study in 2004, published in the Journal of Medical Entomology, found that mozzies landed on people with group O blood almost twice as often as those with group A. Those with group B were in the middle. Around 40 per cent of people have group O blood. The reason why some blood groups are preferable to mosquitoes is a mystery. COLOURED CLOTHES . Although scent is the main way mosquitoes locate people, they also use their vision. James Day, a medical entomologist at the University of Florida, says insects looking for hosts in daylight are more likely to be drawn to people wearing dark colours such as navy, black and blue, because these stand out. However, different species of mosquito appear to find different colours attractive - so by keeping away one biter, you might end up attracting another.","There are over 3,500 species of mosquito in the world... 33 in Britain .

"Many RBS customers were left seething today after a glitch left them unable to use their credit or debit cards at store checkouts and ATMs. The issue, which comes just one day after the bank was fined £56million for a huge IT meltdown in 2012, also affected those with sister banks NatWest and Ulster Bank. An RBS spokesman insisted the issue only affected those attempting to make higher-value payments or transactions abroad - resulting in 'minimal customer impact'. Scroll down for video . Many Royal Bank of Scotland customers were left seething today after a glitch left them unable to use their cards at store checkouts and ATMs . But many customers vented their fury on Twitter over the glitch - slamming RBS as 'pathetic' and a 'bunch of clowns' on the bank's helpline page. One frustrated customer asked the bank: 'When can we expect a resolution to the card issue? Trying to book an emergency flight home and this is extremely time sensitive.' Another complained on Natwest's website of payments failing to be processed. The customer wrote: 'Did a Tesco shop yesterday, everything went through. Advised this morning by Tesco that the payment did not go through.' The customer, who described the situation as 'very poor', said they had been told by the bank that an issue was affecting a number of Visa debit card customers. Another customer, who registered his complaint on Twitter, said: 'Debit card transactions not working! When is this going to be resolved? Pathetic.' Frustration: Customers vented their fury on Twiiter this morning after finding themselves unable to use their cards at ATMs and in stores . RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton has said that since the 2012 IT crash, which cost the firm a £56million fine yesterday, the bank has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on increasing the resilience of its systems . The problems started at 7.45am and were resolved by 9.15am, the bank said. A statement from RBS said: 'A small number of customers experienced issues early this morning while using their RBS, NatWest and Ulster Visa debit and credit cards. 'There was minimal customer impact and the issue was quickly resolved.' Yesterday, the bank was landed with penalties totalling £56million by regulators over its huge systems crash in 2012, which also affected customers of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank. Former chief executive Stephen Hester forfeited his bonus of up to £2.4million over the 2012 IT fiasco at a bank which is still 81 per cent owned by the taxpayer . RBS chairman Sir Philip Hampton has said that since the incident, the bank has spent hundreds of millions of pounds on increasing the resilience of its IT systems. RBS admitted to 'unacceptable weaknesses' in its computer systems as around 6.5 million customers - equivalent to 10% of the UK population - suffered disruption lasting for several weeks in some cases. RBS bosses admitted previously they had failed to invest enough in their IT systems for decades, following a computer meltdown that hit millions of customers. The extraordinary admission a after a string of glitches where millions of  debit card cash withdrawals and purchases, some credit card transactions, plus online banking and banking via mobile phone, were blocked. RBS chief executive Ross McEwan said the most recent systems failure was ‘unacceptable’, and admitted: ‘For decades, RBS failed to invest properly in its systems. We know we have to do better.’ In 2012 a junior technician in India was blamed for causing the RBS computer meltdown which froze millions of British bank accounts. But it later emerged it came from their Edinburgh headquarters. They were unable to use online banking facilities or obtain accurate account balances from ATMs. Mortgage payments were delayed and customers left without cash in foreign countries. The issues in summer 2012 stemmed from a botched upgrade to the software that processed updates to customers' accounts overnight. When it noticed problems with the upgrade the bank's central IT function decided to uninstall it without first testing the consequences of that action. The bank is investigating the underlying cause of today's problems, which it said are unrelated to the meltdown of two years ago. The IT meltdown fine came just days after RBS was one of six banks fined £2.6billion for rigging the £3trillion a day foreign exchange market. The bank was hit with a £400million penalty by UK and US regulators, with regulators publishing damning transcripts of its traders bragging about the conspiracy. The IT failure has raised concerns about the state backed lender’s creaking computer systems which have continued to let down customers in recent years. RBS suffered another systems outage in December on the busiest online shopping day of the year, the third time in about 18 months that such a problem had prevented customers from using cards, cash machines and online banking services. It says it has been ploughing billions of pounds into bolstering its IT systems to help ensure that similar problems do not reoccur. The lender recently pledged to invest an extra £1billion in its digital and IT services as it attempts to persuade more of its customers to bank online and on their mobile phones. Before the 2008 financial crisis, Royal Bank of Scotland was one of the largest and most aggressive banks in the world. The bank was founded in Edinburgh in 1727, but by the end of the 20th century it was a major player in the City of London too as the UK capital became the world's leading financial centre. RBS sealed its place at the top table of British banking in 2000 when it bought NatWest, which dates back to 1650 and was considered one of the 'Big Four' retail banks in the UK. Fred Goodwin, right, became chief executive of RBS the following year and pioneered a gung-ho expansion strategy with resources poured into its investment banking division. One of the biggest deals came when RBS joined a consortium to buy Dutch bank ABN Amro for £49billion, which was later revealed as a major overvaluation. With the advent of the 2007 credit crunch and subsequent global financial turmoil, RBS was exposed as being dangerously indebted and unable to meet its obligations. The Labour Government felt it had no option but to step in, and in October 2008 it took a 57 per cent stake in the bank in return for £37billion of new capital. As the bank's losses spiralled and it required even more bail-out money, the state share of the firm rose to 82 per cent. Much of the blame for RBS's troubles was attributed to Goodwin, who was forced to resign and subsequently stripped of the knighthood he had received in 2004. But it has repeatedly denied reports that the problems in the summer of 2012 were caused by workers in the Indian city of Hyderabad, where it set up an IT support centre to cut costs. The results of its internal investigation into the source of the failure have yet to be published as it waits for the FCA’s verdict. Last night one expert suggested RBS has escaped lightly. David Buik from broker Panmure Gordon said: ‘Given the size of the trangression and the damage caused to customers this fine is nothing more than symbolic. We are talking about a bank which could not even get the basics right - stuff that affects people in their day to day life. It’s little wonder there is a complete lack of trust between banks and their customers.’","Today's glitch left thousands struggling to use cards at ATMs and in stores .

"Gamble: Punters can lose up to £300 a minute on betting terminals, according to the study published yesterday by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling . Betting terminals nicknamed the ‘crack cocaine of gambling’ are each making bookmakers more than £47,000 a year, according to a report. Punters bet £8.6billion on the machines last year and lost £1.6billion – giving the bookies a profit margin of 19 per cent, it says. When winning and losing bets are added up, a total of £46billion was wagered on the fixed odds betting terminals where customers can lose up to £300 a minute, according to the study published yesterday by the Campaign for Fairer Gambling. The campaign group, which is demanding that the maximum stake be slashed to £2, also claims that bookmakers have targeted the machines at poorer areas, a claim hotly disputed by the gambling industry. There are more than 34,000 FOBTs in the country and with total profits at £1.6billion each machine made £47,320. The report says that in the 55 most deprived boroughs of the country – representing the poorest quarter of the population – punters staked £13billion in 2,691 betting shops last year. They lost £470million of this money. By contrast in the wealthiest quarter of councils customers staked £6.5billion over the same period in 1,258 bookmakers, losing only £231million of it. While punters using FOBTs lost an average of £1,096 last year in the poorest districts, those in the wealthiest boroughs lost an average of £519, it says. The report also finds that while the number of betting shops has risen across the country by 288 to 9,343 over the last year, the number actually fell in the West Midlands, where bookmakers appear to make less money from the machines. The average fixed odds gambler lost £776 last year in the West Midlands, but in the North East where punters lost £1,371, the number of betting shops soared by 8 per cent last year. Adrian Parkinson, from the campaign group, said: ‘Bookmakers are not making as much money from some regions and in those they’ve cut the number of shops.’ With political pressure building for action against FOBTs, bookmakers last week issued a new code of conduct to curb the incidence of problem gambling from the high stakes machines. Money making: There are more than 34,000 FOBTs in the country and with total profits at £1.6billion each machine made £47,320 . The code, in force from this week, means FOBT punters in England and Wales can set their own limits and ensures they will receive on screen alerts after 30 minutes or if £250 is spent. The Association of British Bookmakers brought in the code as it awaits a report into the dangers of FOBTs, which is widely expected to lead to a Government crackdown. Last night the association hit back at the Campaign for Fairer Gambling report. Dirk Vennix, the association’s chief executive, said: ‘The CFFG allegation is total fantasy, and we can prove it. The gambling industry does not target deprived areas. It never has. It never will. ‘Like any retailer, we base our decisions on factors such as population density, footfall and rental costs. We don’t want problem gamblers in our shops.’ The association claimed the number of betting shops is actually declining. It said the CFFG’s figures were inflated because they also include some £2 stake gambling machines.","Customers can lose up to £300 a minute on fixed odds betting terminals .

"Accused: Robin O'Neill, 62, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the deaths of 60-year-old Steve Lott and 28-year-old Jamis Lott . A woman accused of fatally shooting her fiance and his son on the day he ended their engagement pleaded not guilty Thursday to murder. Robin O'Neill, 62, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder and is being held without bail in the deaths of 60-year-old Steve Lott and 28-year-old Jamis Lott. O'Neill called a co-worker and said she had shot Lott and his son, according to a police affidavit. The co-worker called police. Police said O'Neill appeared to be drunk when they arrived at the Townshend residence. And as she was being driven away by police, she recited prayers, requested red wine and cigarettes, and told herself, 'you can go to prison for the rest of your life, 'cause you killed the (expletive).' In an interview, O'Neill said she and Lott had been engaged since July, but the relationship started getting 'weird' in September, with Lott spending time with a female friend, the affidavit said. O'Neill told police she and Lott had gotten into several arguments in recent weeks in which he had become physical with her. 'O'Neill told us she had multiple bruises on her body from Lott,' Detective Scott Dunlap wrote. 'During her interview, I observed bruising on both of O'Neill's arms.' She told another officer that Lott had been 'beating the holy c**p out of me,' police said. On Tuesday, as they were riding to work together, he told her the engagement was off, the affidavit said. That night, she told police she drank a lot of wine, and Lott's son showed up to do laundry, the affidavit said. The two men talked in the kitchen, and Lott said she doesn't remember what happened next. She said she either picked up a gun or had the gun in her hand and saw the two men on the floor in a pool of blood, the affidavit said. According to the Brattleboro Reformer, an acquaintance told police Lott had mentioned an argument he had with O'Neill as they lay in bed Nov. 15. 'O'Neill told Lott, 'I'll fix you,'' court papers say, recounting the alleged incident. 'O'Neill then leaned over to her bedside stand, and Lott reached across and slapped the drawer out of her hands. Lott knew O'Neill had a gun, and he thought she was getting her gun. Lott got up quickly, got dressed and got out of there.' Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Robin O'Neill, 62, is charged with two counts of second-degree murder .

"A prominent Manhattan lawyer claims that he was booted from the high-end spin studio chain SoulCycle for representing a former employee in a lawsuit over unpaid wages. Attorney Douglas Wigdor has filed a lawsuit of his own against SoulCycle accusing the owners of the exclusive fitness studios of making an example out of him to dissuade other workers from taking legal action against them. It all started when Wigdor, a former law partner of Brooklyn District Attorney Ken Thompson, took on a wage-theft class action lawsuit in May 2013 on behalf of former SoulCycle spin instructor Nick Oram. Booted: Manhattan lawyer Douglas Wigdor (left) has accused SoulCycle of banishing him for representing former spin instructor Nick Oram (right) in a lawsuit over unpaid wages . Exclusive: SoulCycle is a chain of 25 high-end spin studios nationwide, including 12 in New York . Oram had claimed that his employer did not pay instructors for time spent preparing for class and taking part in training programs. Wigdor now alleges that both he and Oram were banished from SoulCycle studios just four days after he filed the federal class action lawsuit. In court documents filed by Wigdor Thursday, and cited by the New York Post, the 46-year-old high-powered lawyer writes that if SoulCycle owners Julie Rice and Elizabeth Cutler are allowed to get away with the ban, other businesses would be able to refuse service to attorneys and their clients who 'bring legitimate action' against them. ‘They can’t go around flouting the fact that they kicked out the lawyer who represented one of their former employees,’ Wigdor told The Post. Cutler and Rice launched SoulCycle in 2006, opening their first studio on the Upper West Side offering intense 45-minute spin classes. Fitness guru: Last year, Nick Oram filed a class-action lawsuit against SoulCycle accusing his employer of failing to pay him for time spent preparing for class and taking part in training programs . Persona non grata: Just four days after filing the suit, both Oram (pictured left and right) and his attorney learned that they were not welcome at any SoulCycle location . The company now boasts 25 locations nationwide, including 12 in New York City, with plans to open up to 60 studios worldwide by next year. SoulCycle has a large following among celebrities, including Lady Gaga, Bradley Cooper and Jake Gyllenhaal. Mr Wigdor reached a confidential settlement with SoulCycle in Nick Oram's case back in June, and now he hopes to be allowed to return to his favorite spin studio near his Union Square office. ‘It's not about money. It's about principle,’ the die-hard cyclist told the New York Daily News. Mr Wigdor, who lives in Queens and bikes every day to work in Manhattan, told the paper that over the years, he has sued Con Edison, Starbucks, banks and hospitals, and if those institutions were to retaliate against him in a similar fashion for doing his job, he would have been in real trouble. Not backpedaling: SoulCycle owners Julie Rice and Elizabeth Cutler refused to let Wigdor back in even after a Manhattan judge ruled that they had failed to show any 'legitimate, non-discriminatory reason' for banning . Let me back in! Wigdor is not interested in monetary damages - he just wants to be allowed to return to his favorite SoulCycle studio . In October 2013, a federal court judge ruled that SoulCycle had failed to show any 'legitimate, non-discriminatory reason' for banning Oram and Wigdor from the fitness chain, but the owners would not budge. Wigdor, who specializes in labor law, is best known for bringing a lawsuit against Dominique Strauss-Kahn on behalf of Sofitel New York maid Nafissatou Diallo, who accused the French economist of sexually assaulting her in 2011. The charges against Strauss-Kahn were eventually dropped due to serious issues with his accuser’s credibility and lack of evidence.","Labor lawyer Douglas Wigdor is suing SoulCycle demanding to be allowed to return to his favorite Chelsea gym .

"We've all been there. You've walked out the door, gotten in the car, then promptly realized you've forgotten your phone. Much to everyone else's annoyance, you head back inside to get it. At least we are all in good company: now President Obama has had the same memory failure too. On his way to Las Vegas to promote his immigration executive actions, Obama boarded his Marine One helicopter on the White House's South Lawn. But he promptly disembarked and headed back into the executive mansion. Scroll down for video . I'm off: President Barack Obama signals to his aides and staff that he will return to the White House because he forgot something before his departure on Marine One for Las Vegas . Found it! A relieved President Obama crosses the White House lawn brandishing his Blackberry after returning to the White House, leaving Marine One on the South Lawn. When he emerged moments later, the president said he had forgotten his Blackberry, pulling it from its holster and showing it to reporters and photographers. But an Associated Press photographer captured a curious thing when Obama first got out of the helicopter: . His Blackberry was already in its holster.So does he have two phones and had lifted the wrong one? Or had he forgotten something else which he wasn't willing to disclose. Phone lover: Obama is the first president who is a slave to his smartphone. His Blackberry has been either in his hands - or a belt holster - since he was running for president. Addict: Mr Obama refused to give up his Blackberry when he entered the White House and is the first president to use a smartphone to read emails . Either way, the president's love of his smartphone is well known. When he entered the White House he had to give up the BlackBerry which he had carried throughout his campaign, in exchange for one whose security had been upgraded by the NSA. It is hardly a normal model: as well as being heavily encrypted, it can only communicate with 10 people, so that his conversations remain private - for now - and documented for the future. Currently there is a review under way of communications for the White House. Analysts are assessing whether the executive should move to use a different operating system, meaning the president could have an Android or Apple phone. However the review is unlikely to be completed and new contracts awarded until 2017. Mr Obama's use of a Blackberry makes him a rarity as the company's presence in the market has fallen dramatically since being outpaced by first Apple and then the Android operating systems. Samsung has become the biggest-selling smartphone with its Android ranges.","President was on the way to Las Vegas to promote immigration amnesty when he got off Marine One as it stood on the South Lawn .

"When stuntman Ben Toyer heard there was a role coming up in a Hollywood movie that would require being able to pole dance he thought he’d give it a shot. The blonde-haired model, who earns a living getting run over and set on fire in films, was 21 at the time and soon realised there was an added bonus to joining his local pole dancing class in Sydney’s Bondi Beach. ‘I copped a lot of flak from my mates until they realised I’m a straight male in a room dancing with girls,’ Ben told Daily Mail Australia.

Ben performed on cruise boats, clubs and Sydney’s Luna Park. Ben and his school friends used to train around the city including near the Royal Botanical Gardens, where he is pictured here . He joined a gymnastics class when he was younger but quit when they wouldn't let him do flips . Asked how women react to his pole dancing he said: ‘They love it, you do get a lot of attention.’ But he never felt like just a ‘piece of meat’. ‘We joke about me being objectified but I’m not really. You are so comfortable with it. ‘There is only one backstage area so you do have people getting changed around you but the woman aren’t like “oh no he’s in the room”. ‘It’s up to you how you act because you are changing in a room full of women in their underwear. There’s a right and a wrong way to act,’ he reasoned. As well as working as a stuntman in films, TV shows and commercials Ben is also a model . Despite the associations that come with pole dancing, Ben thanks the sport for making him as strong as he is now . His time pole dancing taught him how to do the 'flags' move shown in the top photograph in this article, where he hangs off poles horizontally . Ben thinks his pole dancing stint is the reason his strength is so good now. He describes himself as a stunt man and model first and foremost, but when his friends are around ‘and want to have a dig’ his pole dancing is mentioned. ‘They bring it up before I will,’ he laughed. ‘But it’s great fitness that’s really all it is… it’s a different way of moving your body and you don’t get that strength through anything else or going to the gym.’ The 24-year-old, who happens to be single, said his time pole dancing taught him how to do the ‘flags’ move shown in the photographs in this article, where he hangs off poles horizontally. Ben got into the stunt business after getting hooked on parkour and free-running as a 14-year-old teenager with his two best mates, growing up in Hornsby, on the Upper North Shore of Sydney. The Sydneysider, seen here by the city's iconic Opera House, practises his moves near his home in Bondi Beach . After leaving school he became a qualified stuntman in 2009 and has now played parts in The Great Gatsby, Wolverine and The Sapphires . He said his parent’s front yard is filled with old racing cars and motorbikes used for testing out his stunts . Ben has learned all the skills he thinks he could possibly need for his work as a stuntman including 'drifting' in cars . ‘At 16 or 17 I found out that stunts is a real job when I met a performer… I made the phone calls and did everything I could to get into it,’ he said. Ben left school and enrolled in a stunt course which taught him how to drive like in the movies and gave him all the technical knowledge needed to avoid nasty accidents. By 2009 he was a fully-qualified stuntman and his parent’s front yard was soon filled with old racing cars and motorbikes used for testing out his stunts. There have been cuts and bruises but Ben’s still never broken a bone in his body. ‘Australia is not a huge industry and more and more people are doing it, everyone knows everybody… it’s not just films it’s TV and commercials,’ he explained. Ben once jumped off a cliff for a scene in Home and Away and certainly isn't afraid of heights . His work has seen him travel across Australia, to India in a live Spiderman show and to New Zealand for a part in the third The Hobbit film . A highlight of his job so far was when he partied at the Gatsby pool party in the 2013 Australian-American blockbuster The Great Gatsby . Since starting out, he’s travelled across Australia, to India in a live Spiderman show and to New Zealand for a part in The Hobbit 3. He’s appeared on billboards for Bonds underwear, shaved his head to be Luke Hemsworth’s body double in upcoming sci-fi flick Infinity and fallen down a cliff in Home and Away. He said a highlight so far was when he partied at the Gatsby pool party in the 2013 Australian-American blockbuster The Great Gatsby, starring Leonardo DiCaprio. ‘You’re not always doubling an actor and you’re not always doing stunts… A lot of the time you are doing more than they can allow an extra to do,’ he reasoned. ‘In Great Gatsby I was playing a rowdy hanging out of a car and I was also in the pool party as a partier, jumping and flipping into the pools, shaking bottles of champagne and throwing people in the water,’ Ben said. One of the scariest stunts he's had to do was  being a hit by a motorbike on the show Sea Patrol . As a model, Ben was plastered four storeys high on a giant billboard beside Sydney’s Anzac Bridge for Bonds underwear brand . ‘Inside the studio was the whole pool and everyone was dressed up.’ Ben even worked in a scene with DiCaprio, who he said is ‘very professional’. ‘He’s there to do a job, and he’s a great actor.’ When it comes to being scared, Ben said falling down a cliff in Home and Away and being a hit by a motorbike on Sea Patrol was a ‘big head game’. ‘How do you get hit by a motorbike? We strapped a mat to the front of it and practised,’ Ben recalled. ‘It’s all about body placement,’ when getting hit by a car or motorbike. When something is speeding towards him he's thinking ‘about his training… it’s all timing… it’s a calculated risk’. Ben doesn’t just spends hours in the gym, his weekly routine will involve a mix of cardio, fight training and gymnastics. Ben is strict about what he eats and currently follows the Paleo diet, which avoids carbs. 'I train less because I eat quite well,' he explained . He said stunt person jobs in Australia aren't as common and the parts are getting more and more competitive . He spends his time practising stunts in motorbikes and cars, abseiling, diving, perfecting his rope skills, snowboarding, wakeboarding, riding a BMX and skating . ‘You need body control and to be coordinated to control your body in the air during flips. ‘Then you’ve got everything else: motorbikes, cars, abseiling, diving, rope skills, snowboarding, wakeboarding, BMX and skating,’ he said. ‘Anything that an actor can’t do or could happen on a job, you need to learn how to do.’ Ben is also strict about what he eats – and currently follows the Paleo diet, which avoids carbs. ‘I train less because I eat quite well,’ he explained. But for him the discipline is worth it because he gets to be a stuntman. ‘It’s the best job for me, it’s definitely not for everybody… a lot of people don’t want to be hit by cars, set on fire or fall of buildings. ‘I love it whether there is a lot of work around or if it’s quite, there’s nothing else I want to do.’ Follow Ben Toyer on Instagram and Facebook for more photos.

"While officials initially claimed that the strike on the U.S. consulate in Libya was a protest gone wrong, new evidence has suggested that there were obvious clues that terrorism was involved. The consulate assault, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of the September 11 attacks, led to the deaths of four Americans - including Ambassador Chris Stevens. Confusion over what sparked the Benghazi violence may have stemmed from the CIA, which distributed 'talking points' to top officials on September 14. Scroll down for video . Deadly attack: The consulate was reportedly bombed twice in the months leading up to the attack, which occurred on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 terror attacks . The unclassified documents, obtained by The Daily Beast, said in part: 'The currently available information suggests that the demonstrations in Benghazi were spontaneously inspired by the protests at the U.S. Embassy in Cairo and evolved into a direct assault against the U.S. diplomatic post in Benghazi and subsequently its annex.' 'There are indications that extremists participated in the violent demonstrations.' Likely working off the CIA document, . government officials like UN Ambassador Susan Rice and White House Press . Secretary Jay Carney, said there was little evidence the violence was . planned. However, the document went on to say that the 'assessment may change as additional information is collected' and that the investigation is 'on-going.' Destruction: A man walks in the rubble of the consulate after the attack that claimed four Americans . Flames: The White House has admitted they knew the deadly assault, pictured, was an act of terrorism within 24 hours . Additionally, The Daily Beast reported that an intercepted phone call between a local militia group and al-Qaeda's north Africa arm, al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM), indicated that the two factions worked and planned the attack together. On Saturday, the Obama . administration admitted that it knew within 24 hours that the strike . was a pre-planned terrorist attack and not by crazed protestors enraged . by an anti-Islam film. Senior U.S. officials have now . confessed the government privately labelled the attack a terrorist act . almost immediately after it happened, and even knew that the . perpetrators had links to al-Qaeda. Assault: The U.S. Consulate in Benghazi was burned during a protest by an armed group on the eleventh anniversary of the September 11 attacks . Shawn Turner, a spokesman for . Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, said that as U.S. intelligence subsequently learned more about the attack, 'we revised our . initial assessment to reflect new information indicating that it was a . deliberate and organized terrorist attack carried out by extremists.' Turner said it remained 'unclear' if . any individual or specific group commanded the attack. U.S. agencies . nonetheless believe that some of the militants involved in the attack . were 'linked to groups affiliated with, or sympathetic to al-Qaeda.' Rep Peter King, a senior Republican from New York, demanded last week that Rice resign over her statement that the Benghazi attack was not premeditated. Response: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has promised a full and open inquiry into the attack, which occurred on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 . The State Department rejected King's call this afternoon, defending Rice and saying she has done 'a superb job.' Last week, Secretary of State Hillary . Clinton admitted there was an explicit link between the al-Qaeda network . in North Africa and the deadly attacks that killed Ambassador Stevens as well as information management officer Sean . Smith and security personnel Tyrone Woods and Glen Doherty.. Speaking at a Security Council . meeting at the United Nations, Mrs Clinton said an Algerian-founded . branch of the al-Qaeda network was situated in the area, using their . location to plan and execute attacks, like the one in Benghazi on .

"A frail grandmother died after she hit her head when a police officer pushed her and she fell off a doorstep during a row, an inquest has heard. Diane Botham died at her home in Southey Green, Sheffield, from bleeding between the brain and skull after she fell over and hit her head the previous day. Mrs Botham's family are now angry a jury has found the police officer's force to be 'reasonable and necessary' given the fact she was a 'frail 61-year-old'. In August 2012, police had been called to an incident at a property neighbouring Mrs Botham's when she became involved and was told to leave. Diane Botham (left) with her daughter Diane Docherty. The grandmother died following an altercation with a police officer . The inquest was told that she argued with two officers, was pushed and fell backwards from a step and struck her head. PC Thomas Rogers said Mrs Botham tried to 'barge' past him so he used 'minimum force' to get her to move backwards and prevent a breach of the peace continuing. He and colleague PC John Shaw said they helped Mrs Botham to her feet and she continued to shout and swear before her son escorted her away from the property. The inquest heard Mrs Botham, who had been drinking that day - had become increasingly unsteady on her feet in the weeks before her death and found it difficult to climb stairs. Returning home following the altercation, she spent the rest of the day on the sofa in her living room - remaining there until the last member of her family went to bed at 2am. She was found dead the following day. The jury concluded Mrs Botham died as a result of an acute subdural haematoma - a bleed between her skull and brain - caused by a blunt head trauma that had been triggered by the push by the police officer. They added her alcoholism, cirrhosis of the liver, ongoing stability and mobility issues, a hepatitis C infection and an atrophic shrunken brain also contributed to her death. Following the inquest Mrs Botham's family issued a statement saying: 'We are pleased with the conclusion that the push by a police officer played a part in our mum's death but disappointed the jury thought the force used was reasonable. 'Our mum was a frail 61-year-old lady. We do not think she posed a risk of violence. Pictured is the neighbouring home in Sheffield where Mrs Botham  was pushed by the police officer . 'Nothing can lessen our sadness following our mum's death. We continue to believe that our mum should not have been pushed by a police officer. 'Our family continues to miss our mum, sister, grandma and auntie, everyday.' A South Yorkshire Police spokesman said the force had referred the incident to the Independent Police Complaints Commission. He added: 'The IPCC concluded the force used by the officer was reasonable necessary, proportionate and justified and there was no case to answer for misconduct. 'The jury at the inquest found that the force used by the officer was reasonable and necessary.' Solicitor Nancy Collins, representing the family, said: 'The evidence from the inquest demonstrated the use of force by the officer which caused a 61-year-old frail woman to fall backwards off a step was one possible cause of her death. 'The jury concluded the police push was the cause of death but that the use of force was reasonable.'","Diane Botham, 61, died of bleeding in her head following altercation .

"Harvey Nichols was today slammed by activists for selling reindeer pate as a Christmas delicacy. The £15 product is described on the tins as an 'indulgent winter treat' coming from a 'farm-raised relative of Rudolph'. But campaigners were urging the store to ban the product as it 'exploits wild animals'. Fury: Reindeer Pate - dubbed a 'farm raised relative of Rudolph' is being sold by Harvey Nichols. Activists have called for it to be banned . The pate, which is also available on Amazon, has been produced by a west London company called Edible. It is made from Swedish Arctic Reindeer meat and contains cognac and spices. Edible said on their website that the product, sold in 190g tins, is: 'delicious served on hot buttered toast with a glass of brandy'. Constance Cooper, spokesman for Harvey Nichols, said: 'Our online stock has sold out due to the publicity and demand we've received. 'It's a seasonal product and stocks are limited so we will not be restocking prior to Christmas.' Activists Vegetarians International Voice for Animals today urged Harvey Nichols to ban the product. In a letter to the store, they wrote: 'I understand that the reindeer meat you sell claims to be from farmed animals, this... raises concerns – as farming methods are likely to cause huge amounts of stress to animals used to relatively free range over wide areas.' In the wild: Activists say being farmed kept on a farm causes reindeers a huge amount of stress . A spokesman for the group urged consumers to leave the product on the shelves. He said: 'Whether you celebrate Christmas or . not, can anyone really justify this exploitation of essentially wild . animals for just a bit of twisted festive fun? 'We urge consumers to . reject reindeer meat, and for Harvey Nichols to set an ethical example . of goodwill by dropping it from their stores. 'Of course, eating any . animal causes suffering, so please consider going veggie this . Christmas.' Last year Lidl was slammed for stocking reindeer steaks. Popular: Harvey Nichols say reindeer has sold out at their Knightsbridge store and has been a big hit with customers . A spokesman for Harvey Nichols said the product had been a big hit with customers and they had sold out in their London store. 'Our . Foodmarket specialises in obtaining delicacies for our customers’ international gourmet palates and Reindeer is a traditional part of the . Scandinavian diet,' he said. 'Interestingly . Reindeer is growing in popularity in the UK as, like venison, it is low . in fat, which some people prefer in their diet. 'We have already sold out from our Knightsbridge store and due to the publicity it has received it has become a top seller on our website too. 'The reindeer we stock is farmed in Sweden and complies to EU legislation, in a similar way that we would farm sheep or cattle in this country.’ The product disappeared from Harvey Nichols' website.

"Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers (NGN) for libel over a story about his encounter with PC Toby Rowland on September 19 2012 . A veteran police marksman has told of his disbelief at Andrew Mitchell’s ‘childish’ behaviour in Downing Street the night before the Plebgate incident. PC Gareth Bonds was on duty when the MP demanded to be allowed to cycle through the main gate, a court heard. Mr Mitchell allegedly shouted: ‘I’m the Government Chief Whip. I want to leave through these gates.’ In a written statement to the High Court, PC Bonds said: ‘During this exchange I stood and watched in disbelief at how childish a grown man in his position was being and found it embarrassing. ‘I therefore spoke to my colleagues and told them to just open the gates as it was ridiculous to argue over a gate. I found Mr Mitchell’s tone overbearing, but he did not swear at us.’ PC Bonds, who has been a policeman for 30 years, said the incident was the only one like it in his nine years with the Diplomatic Protection Group. ‘Most people are quite polite,’ he added. The following evening – September 19, 2012 – Mr Mitchell again demanded to cycle through the main gate in Downing Street, but was refused. He was alleged to have told officers: ‘Best you learn your f****** place, you don’t run this f****** Government, you’re f****** plebs.’ PC Toby Rowland  is in turn suing Mr Mitchell over statements he made from December 2012 which he claims accused him of fabricating his allegations . Mr Mitchell has always denied the comments but admitted saying, ‘I thought you guys were supposed to f****** help us.’ The 58-year-old Sutton Coldfield MP was forced to resign a month later from his position as Chief Whip. PC Alex Jamieson, another officer on duty the night before the Plebgate row, said the MP became ‘agitated and refused to listen’ when he was asked to use the pedestrian gate. He told the court such events were rare, but recalled an occasion when Labour minister Peter Mandelson ‘charged through the main gates about five years ago on foot’ because he was late for a meeting. PC Jamieson added: ‘He was furious at being delayed for five minutes and when I explained that we were clearing two vehicles, he said he wasn’t having it and charged through on foot. The gates were already open to let a vehicle in and he wasn’t a security threat as I knew who he was, so I did not challenge him.’ Mr Mitchell is suing News Group Newspapers, publishers of The Sun, over the claim that he called officers ‘f****** plebs’. News Group Newspapers argues its article was substantially true. PC Toby Rowland is suing the MP for suggesting that he made up the allegations. The case continues.

"The House of Representatives, spearheaded by a growing Republican majority, sued the Obama administration on Friday over its implementation of President Barack Obama's health care law, saying he had overstepped his legal authority in carrying out the program. The case was assigned to Judge Rosemary M. Collyer, who was appointed to her post by President George W. Bush in 2003. The Department of Justice, which will defend the case on behalf of the Treasury and Health and Human Services Departments, has 60 days to file a response. GOP lawmakers filed the lawsuit in federal district court in Washington the morning after Obama announced unilateral executive actions to expand protections for millions of immigrants who came to the U.S. illegally. While Republicans complained that Obama had unconstitutionally exceeded his powers with those actions, the suit filed Friday did not address immigration. House Speaker John Boehner opened up a new chapter in the Obamacare saga on Friday, filing a promised federal lawsuit against the Obama administration . SCROLL DOWN TO READ THE LAWSUIT . One Republican official said party leaders are considering amending the suit to include Obama's actions on immigration, a change that would require approval by the GOP-controlled House. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to describe internal Republican deliberations. That move, however, would require a new resolution from the House of Representatives, since the resolution on which Friday's lawsuit is based was narrowly drawn and limited to Obamacare. 'If this president can get away with making his own laws, future presidents will have the ability to as well,' Boehner said in a written statement announcing the lawsuit. 'The House has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action.' House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi criticized Republicans for spending taxpayer money to use a private attorney to bring a 'meritless' case. 'This lawsuit is a bald-faced attempt to achieve what Republicans have been unable to achieve through the political process.' 'The legislative branch cannot sue simply because they disagree with the way a law passed by a different Congress has been implemented,' said Pelosi. She accused the GOP of 'prioritizing the special interests and the howls of impeachment-hungry extremists before the needs of the nation.' The House authorized the lawsuit in a near party-line vote in July as congressional re-election campaigns were heating up. Democrats said Obama had acted legally and said the GOP measure was a political stunt aimed at motivating conservatives to vote and distracting them from calls by some to go even further and impeach the president. The lawsuit was filed Friday against the departments of Health and Human Services and the Treasury. It accuses Obama of unlawfully delaying the 2010 health care law's requirement that many employers provide health care coverage for their workers. That so-called employer mandate requires companies with 50 or more employees working at least 30 hours weekly to offer health care coverage or pay fines. Businesses with fewer than 50 workers are exempt. CONSTITUTION COP: Boehmer said the House of Representatives 'has an obligation to stand up for the Constitution, and that is exactly why we are pursuing this course of action' The requirement was initially to take effect this year. Now, companies with 50 to 99 employees have until 2016 to comply while bigger companies have until next year. The suit also accuses Obama of illegally making an estimated $175 billion in payments over the next decade – including $3 billion in the past year – to insurance companies, even though Congress hasn't provided money for that purpose. According to the suit, insurance companies offering coverage under the health law are supposed to offer reduced rates to policyholders. The law established a fund to reimburse insurers for some of those lower rates. Congress hasn't put any money into that fund but the administration has started making payments to insurance companies anyway, the suit says. Congressional Republicans have all opposed the health care overhaul. The GOP-led House has voted over 50 times to repeal it or pare it back.

Once close: Rubenstein, pictured above with Sharpton, met his accuser at the Reverend's birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant in Manhattan on October 1. Sharpton has since distanced himself from Rubenstein . The woman's attorney told the New York Post that his client does not use any drugs, therefor the fact she tested positive for marijuana implicates Rubenstein. 'Any positive test for narcotics in the system of the victim only supports the belief that she was drugged,' attorneys Keith White and Kenneth Montgomery said in a statement to the Post. 'Our client was in her attacker’s home just days before the test and it would be consistent with her ingesting something at her attacker’s home where Mr. Rubenstein gave the victim cookies.' Lawyers for the woman claim she woke up in the apartment feeling 'foggy', covered in bruises and surrounded by bloody condoms. However, a toxicology report on her blood - which was taken one week after the October 2 incident - came back clean, subsequently switching the investigation to whether the woman voluntarily or involuntarily consumed alcohol. 'If she voluntarily drank alcohol, it’s hard to prove rape, or rather, to charge him with rape,' a police source told The New York Post. Rubenstein was reportedly filmed on a security video making out with the woman and her female friend, in an elevator of his Upper East Side apartment complex, according to The New York Daily News. The woman's lawyers- Kenneth J. Montgomery and Keith White - deny this occurred. They also say the drug test does not hinder their case. Investigation: NYPD officers are pictured above removing bags of evidence from Rubenstein's apartment. They hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy . 'The results of any toxicology is of no consequence considering the victim’s injuries, statement and lack of consent,' one lawyer told The Post. Rubenstein claims what happened between the two was consensual. He has not been charged with a crime. On October 3, the day after the alleged incident, the woman - a Brooklyn mother - went to the hospital suffering from vaginal bleeding and bruising. Her lawyers claim she later used a rape kit and that the results were consistent with sexual assault. They demanded Rubenstein at least be charged with third-degree rape. The alleged attack took place after Sharpton's 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant, which was attended by New York mayor Bill de Blasio, Governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee . Rubenstein and his alleged victim met at the party and went home to his Upper East Side apartment along with a third person, who later left. After the allegations surfaced, NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7 million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan and reportedly collected 'biological evidence'. Allegations: Rubenstein has maintained the encounter was consensual. He is pictured above with a former client, one-time Playboy playmate Stephanie Adams . Denial: Rubenstein's own defense lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said a letter about the alleged victim's injuries is 'offensive and patently false' Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton has also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn't mean you're guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain't no place for that in our community. The district attorney's office told the Times the case was being investigated, and declined to comment further. Rubenstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, rebutted the letter, saying that 'all evidence to date points to consensual sex between two consenting adults, who were both active and awake throughout.' Brafman described the letter as 'offensive and patently false.'","Sanford Rubenstein is accused of raping the unnamed woman after Sharpton's birthday on October 2 .

"Police found 250 students dressed in bondage gear and flat caps after being called to a jointly-themed S&M and Marks & Spencer birthday party in Newcastle. While some of the students walked around in skimpy leather outfits carrying whips and handcuffs, others arrived at the packed-out terraced property wearing some of Marks & Spencer's more traditional lines. The party took place on Saturday at a house in Jesmond, Newcastle, an area of the city favoured by more well-to-do students. Police found dozens of students dressed in bot bondage gear after being called to jointly-themed S&M and Marks & Spencer birthday party at a packed terraced house in Jesmond, Newcastle . The huge party, organised one month in advance, included a 'chill zone' where there was a 12ft by 4ft ball-pit holding around 3,000 balls (pictured) According to the Newcastle Tab student newspaper, one of the hosts said afterwards: 'First and last time I give a policeman a tour of my house dressed in gimp gear.' Photographs posted on social media showed dozens of students donning various bondage-style outfits, including black lingerie and leather dominatrix gear. Another included one of a topless man with an oiled chest who was wearing a leather dog collar and lead. But some revellers were feeling less outrageous - and opted for flat caps and Marks & Spencer dresses instead. Toby Finnis, a second year Countryside Management at Newcastle explained he had chosen the M&S theme because his 'mother loves Marks & Spencer'. The huge party was organised one month in advance and even involved sound-proofing the house by taping mattresses to the windows. But police were still called to the house after neighbours complained about the loud noise coming from the property. They were then led around the house by a student wearing beige shorts, a bull gag and a leather collar. One room in the house had been converted into an 'urban jungle' using leaves, camouflage, signs, strobe lights, smoke machines and music speakers. Police were called to the house just before 3am on Sunday after neighbours complained about the loud noise coming from the property . One room in the house had been converted into an 'urban jungle' using leaves, camouflage, signs, strobe lights, smoke machines and music speakers . Another room upstairs was made into a 'chill zone' with a 12ft by 4ft ball-pit holding around 3,000 balls. Alongside it, there was a bouncy castle with a laptop, inviting music requests. The organisers - who had DJs playing on decks - even employed a bouncer to man the door and monitor attendees by 'clicking' them in and out. The party led to a nearby Ann Summers almost running out of its bondage stock. Jake Leighton, 20, a Sociology student at Newcastle University, said: 'It was surreal leading a police officer around the house dressed the way I was. 'I was wearing beige shorts, a bull gag and a leather collar at the time. The police officer actually took it all in good spirits. 'He was particularly impressed with the bouncy castle that we had and he said that he would write about us favourably in his report.' He added that 'a lot of work' had gone in the party, adding: 'There were eight people breaking their backs for three days. 'It was fun and we would like to do it again.'The police were really good about it and I want to make it clear that no action was taken against anyone. 'My memory is a bit sketchy, but I am pretty sure that everyone was gone by about 4am.' A police spokesman said that, when officers arrived at around 3am, they asked the group to keep the noise down. But the students decided to end the party, before leaving in an orderly manner. The party organiser, who did not want to be named, said: 'We sat down a month in advance and worked out a plan. We completely sound-proofed the house and had people on the door. There were so many guests that organisers even employed a bouncer to man the door and monitor attendees by 'clicking' them in and out . Police said they asked the group to keep the noise down and the students agreed to end the party, leaving in an orderly manner . 'But as it got late, we said they could go home and that's when the sound started to get out. 'The police turned up and had a look around. We would do it again but we wouldn't want to upset any neighbours.' Officers looked round the house at about 3am on Sunday and found no evidence of criminality. A spokesman for Northumbria Police said officers were called to the property at 2.43am on Sunday morning. She said: 'We were made aware of the party from a neighbour, and officers decided to attend. The occupants were asked to keep the noise down and ask people to leave because the music was very loud. 'They were spoken to, and agreed to end the party and everyone left in an orderly manner. 'There were no criminal offences disclosed. It was very noisy, with a large number of people inside.'","Huge birthday party was held at a student house in Jesmond, Newcastle .

"Being rich and powerful was little protection to the children of the Medicis who, to the astonishment of scientists, appear to have suffered from rickets. The Medicis were among the most powerful families of the Renaissance, being patrons to Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo, but their children still suffered malnutrition, research has indicated. Rickets is closely linked to malnutrition and poverty yet the bones of the remains of nine Medici children analysed by osteoarchaeologists reveal that they also fell victim to the condition. The skull (a&b) and leg bones (c) of don Filippino, who died aged 4 in 1577, showed signs of rickets. He was the seventh child of Francesco I and Giovanna of Austria. The circular cut around the skull was from an autopsy soon after his death. Researchers made the discovery after analysing bones taken from under the floor of the crypt of the Basilica of San Lorenzo in Florence. The tomb of Giangastone, the last Medici Grand Duke (1671–1737), was selected for study because it was still intact, despite previous investigations of Medici tombs, some from before the Second World war. A secret entrance to the tomb was discovered when a marble disc, previously believed to be just decorative, was removed from the floor of the chapel, revealing a set of stone steps that led to a hidden crypt. A large sarcophagus contained the remains of the Grand Duke but on the floor were a series of small coffins and several loose bones which had all been moved about when the River Arno flooded in 1966. Bones from children in the crypt, aged from newborn to about five years old, showed classic signs of rickets, including bow legs and bent arms, scientists from the universities of Pisa and Siena concluded. The lack of vitamin D that caused the condition was attributed by the research team to the Medicis’ desire to protect their offspring. Arm bones (a&b), leg bone (c) and ribs (d) from a nine-month Medici baby showing classic signs of deformity from rickets. Scientists who analysed the remains suspect the swadling of babies and extended weaning were the most likely causes of the vitamin D deficiency. One of the children’s body’s was identified as that of don Filippino (1577-1582) who was known to have had a slightly deformed skull. The researchers suggest rickets was the cause. ‘Diagnosis of a metabolic disease linked to vitamin D deficiency would appear unexpected in children brought up at the court of a Renaissance high social class family, like the Medici of Florence,’ the researchers wrote. Previous studies have already shown that the Medicis continued weaning their children until they were two, with the addition of ‘pap’, probably made from bread and apple or cereal. This diet lacked the essential vitamin D that the children needed and meant that when they learn to crawl and walk their weight bent their leg and arm bones. Babies that were found in the crypt also showed early signs of rickets with lesions to their skulls. Two of the Medici clan, (left) Francesco I (1541-1587) and his father (right)  Cosimo I (1519-1574) who between them fathered at least four of the children in the crypt and perhaps seven. The remains of the children analysed by scientists show they suffered from rickets thought to have been caused by poor diet and being kept indoors . The Medicis, in common with many other wealthy families, kept their young children indoors which could have prevented them from absorbing enough vitamin D from sunlight. Swaddling babies was also commonplace and this would also have reduced their expose to sunlight. The research team wrote: ‘The present study clearly demonstrates how, even in the high social classes, children were at the risk of developing rickets as a result of prolonged breast-feeding and inadequate exposure to sunlight. ‘With this prolonged breast-feeding, vitamin D deficiency is highly expected to rise, in particular if the other main risk factor, inadequate sunlight exposition, is associated with this diet based on maternal milk. The Medici family rose to power in the 13th century in Florence and Tuscany through banking and commerce. Their . patronage of the arts made the region the cradle of the Renaissance. Among the artists and scientists they supported were Leonardo da Vinci, . Galileo, Michelangelo, Botticelli and Benvenuto Cellini. Popes Leo X, Clement VII, Pius IV and Leon XI were all Medicis. In 1737 the dynasty ended when the last Medici ruler died without a male heir. ‘Two hours per week is the required minimum period of exposure to sunlight for infants if only the face is exposed‘During the spring and summer months, infants were likely to be exposed to sufficient sunlight to prevent vitamin D deficiency, but during the colder winter months, they probably spent less time outdoors and were bundled in several layers of protective clothing, especially when they presented frequent health problems. ‘For example, according to historical sources, Filippo was a weak and unhealthy child, suffering from recurrent illness episodes and likely to have been frequently kept indoors. ‘Furthermore, in the Renaissance period, non-ambulant children were swaddled, leaving very little skin exposed.’ Newborn babies should have enough vitamin D from their mothers at birth but, researchers suspect, the mothers may also have suffered from vitamin D deficiency, perhaps as a result of being kept indoors or their practice of wearing thick make-up to prevent them getting a tan. ‘A pale ivory skin was considered a sign of health and elegance, which distinguished noblewomen from peasants engaged in field work,’ the researchers reported in the International Journal of Osteoarchaeology. ‘A white skin was highly desired so that women avoided exposure to sunlight and used white powder to achieve it; one of the most popular and well-known lightening creams was Venetian Ceruse, a white powder obtained by mixing vinegar with lead, which remained popular for about 300 years.’ The Medici women were also likely to have suffered low levels of vitamin D because of repeated childbirth.","Bones from nine Medici children have been found to have signs of rickets .

"A North Carolina restaurant with a 'no concealed firearms' sign on the door has found itself in the midst of a political firefight after it was robbed by three thugs with pistols this week. The Pit Authentic Barbeque in Durham, North Carolina, is getting heaps of criticism from pro-gun advocates who claim that the robbery on Sunday night is proof that banning law-abiding citizens from having weapons means that only criminals will be armed. Police say three men entered the restaurant through the back door and forced all the employees to lay down on the ground. Two of the employees were assaulted during the jostling to subdue them, WTVD reports. Police said they injuries were minor. Scroll down for video . Armed: This surveillance camera footage shows the Sunday night robbery of The Pit Authentic Barbeque in Durham, North Carolina . Two employees were assaulted and sustained minor injuries during the heist. The robbers made off with cash and are still at large . The Pit advertises on its front door the weapons are not allowed on the premises. Pro-gun advocates have seized on this . Several customers were in the dining room, but waiters were able to get them out the front door quickly and none of them were harmed. Surveillance video shows the robbers wearing masks and black hoodies as they point pistols at the employees in the kitchen. The three suspects ran off with cash and are still at large. Owner Greg Hatem has offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to their capture. 'We take this very seriously. We want to make sure our guests and our staff are taken care of,' he told WTVD. Sean D. Sorrentino, who writes An NC Gun Blog, published a photo with a sign on the front door of the restaurant that says 'No weapons' and 'No concealed firearms.' He says the policy ensured that his employees were at the mercy of the armed robbers. Several customers were inside at the time, but they were safely shuffled out of the restaurant . Owner Greg Hatem has offered a $2,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of the robbers . 'No one could resist them. Why? Because the owner of The Pit Authentic Barbecue has banned guns in his restaurant,' Sorrentino writes. The owner, he added, 'went out of his way to make custom signs to make sure we gun owners felt unwelcome.' The restaurant's Facebook page has since been flooded with negative reviews by gun owners who criticize the no concealed weapons policy. 'You INVITED those robbers with the sign you posted... Good job victimizing yourselves. I hope you appreciate the reality check and open up your eyes,' wrote Nicholas Rodgers. Facebook user Robert Tillman said: 'No gun/weapon signs only give criminals confidence that they can get away with their behaviors without resistance. I for one will never set foot in any place, buisness or other wise with a sign in the window prohibiting lawful cary of any weapon (sic).' The owners of The Pit did not respond to the MailOnline's request for comment on Thursday night.","Three men armed robbed The Pit Authentic Barbeque in Durham, North Carolina, and assaulted two employees .

"The principal of a prestigious California high school has resigned after he was found in a motel room with large quantities of heroin, cocaine and meth - and a passed-out woman 30 years his junior. Thomas 'Woody' Price, the 54-year-old married principal of Branson School in Marin County, was arrested at a motel in Sacramento County, where he was found with Brittney Hall, 21, on Friday. Cops were alerted to the Hyatt Place Hotel in Rancho Cordova when Hall's boyfriend called them and said he feared Price was drugging her or doing drugs with her there, SFGate reported. When deputies went to the hotel, they learned that Price had booked a room and, when they knocked on his door, he eventually answered after a 'considerable delay'. Caught: Woody Price, left, the principal of a prestigious California high school, was allegedly found surrounded by drugs at a motel room on Friday. Brittney Hall, 21, right, was also found passed out inside the room . Leader: Price is pictured with other staff from The Branson School, a private school he led since 2007 . They could see the passed out woman on a bed behind him, deputies said. 'He initially told us she was fine and there was nothing to worry about,' Sgt Jason Ramos told KTVU. 'That clearly wasn't apparent to the officers due to the fact that she was unresponsive. They shouted her name several times from the doorway. That was unsuccessful.' The deputies then entered the room and physically woke her. They then looked around the room, which they called a 'den of drug activity'. 'Almost everywhere the officers looked there was some evidence of either drugs or drug paraphernalia,' Ramos said. Arrested: Price allegedly told cops he had long been in a casual relationship with Hall, pictured . Found: Hall's boyfriend called police on Friday evening and told them he was worried she was at this motel in Sacramento County with an older man and feared he was doing drugs with her . They found methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine and prescription drugs, he said. Hall did not need medical attention and the two were taken into custody by Sacramento County sheriff's deputies. They have both been arrested on charges of possession of narcotics, possession of methamphetamine and possession of drugs with intent to sell or distribute, Ramos said. Price was released the next day on $75,000 bail and is next in court on November 24. Hall, who has a two-year-old son, remains in custody. Price told investigators that he and Hall had a casual relationship, KTVU reported. 'He alluded to her as his girlfriend,' Ramos said. Resignation: Price, pictured center at a school event, has resigned from his role, the school announced . Top school: He worked for the $39,475-a-year Branson School, while he wife is a principal of a nearby school . After the charges, Price resigned from his position of the head of $39,475-a-year Branson School. On Monday, School Board Chairman David Golden released a statement to Branson students and parents saying they had been made aware of Price's arrest, the MarinIJ reported. 'The alleged incident did not occur on campus and did not involve any students at our school. As of this afternoon, Dr. Price is not on campus and has tendered his resignation,' it said. 'We are deeply troubled by these developments. We want you to be assured that our school leadership team and our board of trustees are fully committed to the health and well-being of your children. We thank you for your patience and understanding during this difficult time.' Price moved to Marin in 2007 to work as the school's principal, while his wife Katherine took a position as head of the private Prospect Sierra school in El Cerrito. They have one son together.","Woody Price 'was found in a California motel  after a woman's boyfriend called police saying he feared they were doing drugs together'

"A mother and grandmother used rolling pins, umbrellas and vacuum cleaner parts as weapons during a running battle with neighbours in a dispute over a conservatory. Up to 20 people were involved in the brawl which spilled out into a street, bringing a dual carriageway to a halt. At one point a mother-of-four was seen hunched over a man, beating him with a vacuum cleaner attachment, a court heard. Feuding neighbours armed with rolling pins and umbrellas brawled in the street in a dispute over a conservatory, including grandmother Zhaida Hussain (left) and mother-of-four Nazia Akhtar (right) Mohammed Abbas (left) and Arshad Mahmood (right) were also involved in the brawl with the Ahmed family, who built the conservatory at the back of their house in Manchester . A court heard how there was a 'constant history of bickering' between mother-of-four Nazia Akhtar, grandmother Zhaida Hussain, their relatives and the Ahmed family next door. The source of the conflict was a conservatory the Ahmeds built as an extension on the rear of their semi-detached home in Levenshulme, Manchester, which their neighbours blamed for causing damp in their property. The Ahmeds believed the other family were 'jealous' of the building work they had done and both clans installed CCTV on their homes to keep an eye on each other. Vicious fighting broke out between men from both sides outside the adjoining homes on March 31. Hussain, 52, was seen rushing in and out of her house 'gathering weapons' as the fight moved into the middle of a busy road, a judge at Manchester Crown Court was told . The grandmother hurled an umbrella and sticks, one of which narrowly missed a mother with a child, and armed a teenage relative, Mohammed Abbas, the court heard. Abrar Ahmed, Umar Ahmed, Mohammed Hassan and Waqar Ahmed fought with their neighbours in the middle of the street, bringing a dual carriageway to a halt . The Ahmeds built a conservatory on the back of their house (left), angering their neighbours who thought it was causing damp at their home (right) Akhtar threw a rolling pin and a shoe from the porch of her home before charging into the street and flinging a vacuum cleaner attachment, which hit a passing vehicle. She was later seen hunched over an unidentified man, hitting him with the hoover accessory. The 31-year-old mother then ran into the central reservation and thumped several men from the Ahmed family. Efforts to restrain her failed and she returned to her home to throw more sticks and another umbrella at her neighbours. After the battled ended, eight people from both families were arrested and charged, with police using footage from their own cameras to build the case against them. Sentencing, Recorder Rowena Goode said: 'The background to this incident was ongoing hostility between two households which had been going on for some time, and apparently related to an extension to one of the houses.' Akhtar (left) and Hussain (right), as well as Mahmood, all admitted affray in the incident which saw vacuum cleaner attachments used as makeshift weapons . Zhaida Hussain, 52, from Burnage, was sentenced to a two-year community order and 120 hours unpaid work. Nazia Akhtar, 31, from Longsight, was handed a 12-month community order with 140 hours unpaid work and Arshad Mahmood, 26, of Levenshulme, got a 12-month community order with 80 hours unpaid work. All admitted affray, while Akhtar also admitted criminal damage. Mohammed Abbas, 31, of  Levenshulme, got a 12-month community order with 60 hours unpaid work. Abrar Ahmed, 19, and Waqar Ahmed, 21, both of Levenshulme, were conditionally discharged for two years. Umar Ahmed, 17, of Levenshulme, and Mohammed Hassan, 17, from Fallowfield, got six-month referral orders.

"They say that pets can communicate with their owners and this is one tale that really proves it. Family cat Tiger has been hailed a hero after the 19-year-old moggie alerted his owners to a serious house fire in their Gold Coast home which could have claimed their lives.

Tiger had good timing because the blaze spread so quickly that the house soon collapsed. Todd Murray, from Queensland Fire and Rescue, told Channel 9: 'The house was completely damaged, the roof has fallen in, some of the walls have even fallen which is compounding our ability to get water onto the fire to extinguish it.'

"NFL star Adrian Peterson will plead not guilty to allegations that he abused his four-year-old son by severely whipping him with a wooden switch, it was claimed today. In a statement to ESPN, Mary Flood, a spokesman for Peterson's lawyer Rusty Hardin, said: 'If the court asks for a plea tomorrow [and we do expect that to happen] it will very definitely be NOT guilty.' She added that she hoped a trial date would be discussed at the 29-year-old's initial appearance at court in Montgomery County, Texas, but said: 'We don't yet know how the court's docket is looking.' It comes as Peterson has posted a series of tweets criticizing the public for 'believing anything' following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. Scroll down for videos . Couple: NFL star Adrian Peterson (pictured with his wife Ashley in July) will plead not guilty to allegations that he abused his four-year-old son by severely whipping him with a wooden switch, it was claimed today . Criticism: It comes as Peterson has posted a series of tweets criticising the public for 'believing anything' (pictured) following a shocking report on his previous antics and charity by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune . Ambiguous remark: Despite the timing of his message - just hours after his charity was accused of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds in the report - Peterson later added: 'Just in-general!' The Minnesota Vikings running back wrote to his one million followers: 'It's SAD how people these days will believe anything reported by media sources that don't take the time to be GREAT.' Despite the timing of his message - just hours after the report accused his charity of improperly using tens of thousands dollars worth of funds - he later added: 'Just in-general!' Peterson, who has been sidelined for most of this season, allegedly left his son with visible wounds to his thighs, backside and genitals following the 'disciplinary'  beating at his Texas home in May. He is due to appear at court at 10am tomorrow on charges of reckless or negligent injury to a child. It is not known whether he will be asked for a plea or given a trial date. Unless Mr Hardin is able to secure a quick trial date - a task that typically takes around nine to 12 months -  and convince a jury that Peterson did not violate Texas's corporal punishment law, it is likely the player's 2014 season is over. 'I hope we learn more tomorrow,' Ms Flood said. 'But it's possible that we won't get a date tomorrow and we'll just get the beginnings of discussions about a date.'

'I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. Another allegation: The footballer has also been accused of abusing another of his children while discipline him, but no charges have been made. Above, the boy is seen with a head injury . 'No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day.' He added that he has seen a psychologist, who told him that there are usually better ways to discipline children than hitting them, and will 'reevaluate' his forms of discipline in the future. In the Star-Tribune report, which was published yesterday, Peterson was claimed to have six children by six different mothers. He was also said to have previously been the subject of a lengthy police investigation for sexual battery after a booze-fueled sex party that he invited his underage brother to. And his charity was claimed to have given out tens of thousands of dollars to nonprofit organizations that say they never saw a dime. Despite the claims, Peterson has never been accused of wrongdoing with his charity. The Vikings agreed to drop Peterson from the team until the case is wrapped up in the courts after sponsors started to pull out of their agreements. The player is banned from all team activities. Peterson projected a strong family image before his arrest. His father is a convicted felony who was in prison by the time he went to college on a football scholarship, but he has repeatedly talked about his relationship with his mother Bonita Brown. However, he's been quiet about the other part of his family life, including his children, refusing even to say publicly how many he has. In October 2013, his two-year-old son died in South Dakota after being beaten to death by the mother's boyfriend. Last month, the footballer was also accused of injuring another four-year-old son while disciplining him at his gated mansion in The Woodlands last June. Bankable: The Minnesota Vikings have invested heavily in Peterson's image. He was the only player invited to a groundbreaking ceremony for the team's new stadium. He is seen here with owner Zygi Wilf . A photo showed the boy suffering from a head wound covered by two bandages, while other images revealed a scar over his right eye. Peterson reportedly then sent the boy's mother a text message claiming his son had smacked his head on a car seat. However, when she questioned him further, he is said to have later admitted hitting the child, texting: 'Be still n take ya whooping he would have saved the scare [scar]. He aight [all right] . He then wrote: 'I felt so bad, but he did it his self', according to KHOU 11 News Houston. Peterson later revealed  he had disciplined his son for cursing at his sibling, but refused to disclose his method of punishment, it is claimed. Although the boy's mother filed a report with Child Protective Services, no charges were ever made against Peterson. The footballer's attorney declined to comment on the allegations. In the latest case, Peterson faces six months to two years in state prison if convicted. However, as a first-time offender, he could be placed on probation instead. 'My attorney has asked me not to discuss the facts of my pending case. I hope you can respect that request and help me honor it. I very much want the public to hear from me but I understand that it is not appropriate to talk about the facts in detail at this time. Nevertheless, I want everyone to understand how sorry I feel about the hurt I have brought to my child. 'I never wanted to be a distraction to the Vikings organization, the Minnesota community or to my teammates. I never imagined being in a position where the world is judging my parenting skills or calling me a child abuser because of the discipline I administered to my son. 'I voluntarily appeared before the grand jury several weeks ago to answer any and all questions they had. Before my grand jury appearance, I was interviewed by two different police agencies without an attorney. In each of these interviews I have said the same thing, and that is that I never ever intended to harm my son. I will say the same thing once I have my day in court. 'I have to live with the fact that when I disciplined my son the way I was disciplined as a child, I caused an injury that I never intended or thought would happen. I know that many people disagree with the way I disciplined my child. I also understand after meeting with a psychologist that there are other alternative ways of disciplining a child that may be more appropriate. 'I have learned a lot and have had to reevaluate how I discipline my son going forward. But deep in my heart I have always believed I could have been one of those kids that was lost in the streets without the discipline instilled in me by my parents and other relatives. I have always believed that the way my parents disciplined me has a great deal to do with the success I have enjoyed as a man. I love my son and I will continue to become a better parent and learn from any mistakes I ever make. 'I am not a perfect son. I am not a perfect husband. I am not a perfect parent, but I am, without a doubt, not a child abuser. I am someone that disciplined his child and did not intend to cause him any injury. No one can understand the hurt that I feel for my son and for the harm I caused him. My goal is always to teach my son right from wrong and that’s what I tried to do that day. 'I accept the fact that people feel very strongly about this issue and what they think about my conduct. Regardless of what others think, however, I love my son very much and I will continue to try to become a better father and person.'","Adrian Peterson allegedly abused his four-year-old son by whipping him .

"The state of Oregon is ready to throw in the towel after nearly seven months without an Obamacare enrollment website, but not before spending $305 million in federal taxpayer dollars giving it an abortive try. Cover Oregon seemed ready Thursday to scrap its effort and direct Oregonians to use Healthcare.gov, the perennially buggy and overloaded Health and Human Services Department website, to find and buy medical insurance. Alex . Pettit, the state's chief information officer, told a technical advisory board on . Thursday that Oregon should pass operational control to the federal . government and give up on saving its bug-ridden digital ceration. The board could vote as early as Friday on his recommendation. The move, first reported by the Oregonian newspaper, has brought Republican naysayers out of the woodwork with a chorus of we-told-you-sos. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . The $305 million boondoggle never managed to launch an enrolment portal, despite having the same period of years to work with as other, more successful states . Cover Oregon CIO Alex Pettit told an advisory committee on Thursday that the state should drop its trouble-plagued online health exchange and have Oregonians shop for policies through the federal government's online marketplace . 'Each student and teacher and neighbor and friend will live long, in Oregon': The state's costly TV ads for its white-elephant project included a cello chorus and a background that changes scenes a dozen times . California GOP Rep. Darrell Issa said the news 'means federal taxpayers have lost the $305 million spent on the site. Going forward, federal officials should insist that Oregon foot the bill for the state’s transition to the federal exchange.' The Obama administration, he said, 'needs to stop treating taxpayers as a bottomless piggy bank to bail out one botched Obamacare project after another. Poor execution by this Administration is adding billions to the cost of a program that is already too expensive..' Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Cover Oregon 'is the poster child for what’s wrong with Obamacare’s state exchanges.' He lashed out at Democrats, including Oregon's governor and the state's junior senator. 'it will not be lost on anyone that John Kitzhaber and Jeff Merkley were the individuals responsible for giving Oregonians Cover Oregon,' Priebus said in a statement. Both face re-election in November. Greg Walden, the sole Republican in Oregon's congressional delegation, said in a statement that Cover Oregon has become 'the worst financial failure in information technology in state history – and it was completely avoidable. Today's admission of failure underscores the need to stop the waste and get the truth.' 'How did this happen? Who was in charge? That's why I've sought and secured a federal investigation into Cover Oregon. Taxpayers deserve answers and demand accountability.' Gov. John Kitzhaber, shown April 18 at an April 18 water-agreement signing ceremony between American Indian tribes and cattle ranchers, insists he never learned Cover Oregon's Obamacare portal wouldn't be functioning by Oct. 1 . Republican Rep. Darrell Issa, who chairs the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said Thursday that the Obama administration should 'stop treating taxpayers as a bottomless piggy bank to bail out one botched Obamacare project after another' Cover Oregon's PR department went all-out to sell the virtues of a state government-based insurance marketplace in a state that trends blue and where there was great enthusiasm for the Affordable Care Act. One commercial featured a woman singing a wistful folk song while the scenery changed behind her and, at one point, a quartet of cellos provided accompaniment. But the promise was never fulfilled. A slide show that accompanied Pettit's remarks shows that Cover Oregon estimates an additional $78 million cost to fix the website's problems. Handing the reins to the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, however, would cost between $4 and $6 million. If the plan moves ahead, Oregon's system would become part of Healthcare.gov. So far, four top officials have resigned as a consequence of Cover Oregon's failure to provide a single day of website up-time. Reince Priebus, chairman of the Republican National Committee, said Cover Oregon 'is the poster child for what¿s wrong with Obamacare¿s state exchanges' Kitzhaber ordered an independent investigation that found reports of technical roadblocks were ignored by project managers, and blames the Silicon Valley giant Oracle for site-building problems. Oracle Global Corporate Communications chief Deborah . Hellinger said in a statement to MailOnline that the company 'looks . forward to providing any assistance the state needs in moving parts of . Oregon's health care exchange to the federal system if it ultimately . decides to do so.' The review itself cost another $228,000 to commission from an independent outside firm. The governor, however, has insisted that warnings about the website's problems never made it to his desk prior to the planned Oct. 1 launch. Despite the problems, about 240,000 Oregonians managed to choose medical insurance during the six-month open enrollment period – mostly via phone or on paper. A large majority of them, 171,000, opted for taxpayer-funded Medicaid. Cover Oregon hasn't answered questions, including MailOnline's, about whether those people will have to start all over again once the federal government assumes control.","Oregon is the only one of 16 states that has failed to get its Obamacare website online .

"These pictures show the incredible lengths rangers will go to when moving rhinos to a 'safe haven' within South Africa's flagship reserve where they will receive extra protection from poachers. Rangers at Kruger National Park have carried out at least 45 such captures since last month as part of a plan to create a stronghold and prevent the slaughter of the endangered animals. The rhinos were first darted from a low-flying helicopter and then herded towards a road. Once they were subdued and blindfolded, rangers took blood and skin samples and installed a microchip in the horns as a way to identify Kruger's stock. Scroll down for video . Rangers pull a  rhino to a metal cage near Skukuza, South Africa, for transport by truck to a 'safe haven' The sedative must be strong enough to immobilise a rhino but weak enough so that the animal can walk into a crate with men pushing and pulling it with a rope. Some of the rhinos have been moved to other parks within South Africa, which is home to 80 per cent of the world's rhinos, and the relocation 'experiment' is expected to escalate next year. It was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014, exceeding last year's record of 1,004. About two-thirds of the rhinos poached this year died in Kruger, a park that's about the size of Israel and larger than the US state of Connecticut. Kruger National Park has conducted about 45 such captures as part of a plan to create a stronghold within the country's flagship reserve . A darted rhino has skin and blood samples taken and gets microchipped by a ranger at the park . Poachers often dodge an overstretched force of 400 rangers as well as some military units that monitor the 220-mile border between Kruger and Mozambique. The protection zone encompasses at least one-quarter of the park, and is already home to many of Kruger's roughly 10,000 rhinos - half the national population. Dr Sam Ferreira, a large mammal ecologist at Kruger, said the relocated rhinos have adapted well to their new home. 'It's like they're coming to a Saturday afternoon party,' he said. The sedative must be strong enough to immobilise a rhino but weak enough so that the animal can walk into a crate with men pushing and pulling it with a rope . Investigators open the decomposed corpse of a poached rhino in search of forensic evidence . Markus Hofmeyr, head of veterinary services at Kruger park, said: 'The goal is to basically ensure that you've got a foundation of animals that are secure and that you can use as a source population to take elsewhere.' Kruger will focus aircrafts, ranger teams and high-tech surveillance on the zone. The initiative is partly funded by American philanthropist Howard Buffett, a son of investor Warren Buffett who pledged nearly £15million to Kruger's anti-poaching efforts. Low-flying helicopters locate the rhinos, fire darts at them and herd them into a nearby road . Tracking rangers with their dogs reveal how they locate the rhinos and transfer them to the protection zone . Howard Buffett said some of the same methods used by the United States to monitor its border with Mexico will be used in Kruger, including aerostats - large, tethered balloons with infrared cameras that scan the landscape. Environmental Affairs Minister, Edna Molewa, said 'South Africa is considering a range of rhino strongholds, inclusive of national parks, provincial reserves, communal areas and private reserves.' She added that the Department of Environmental Affairs was also looking into the benefits of moving some rhino out of the country. Rhinos were once common throughout Africa and Asia with an approximated worldwide population of 500,000 in the early twentieth century. But despite intensive conservation efforts, poaching of this  species is dramatically increasing, pushing the remaining rhinos closer and closer towards extinction. The Western black rhino was declared extinct by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) in 2011, with the primary cause identified as poaching. All five remaining rhinos species are listed on the IUCN Redlist of threatened species, with three out of five species classified as critically endangered. South Africa is home to 83 per cent of Africa's rhinos and 73 per cent of all wild rhinos worldwide. It was announced earlier this week that 1,020 rhinos have been poached so far in 2014, exceeding last year's record of 1,004. About two-thirds of the rhinos poached this year died in Kruger, a park that's about the size of Israel and larger than the US state of Connecticut. This is far higher than the total of 668 rhinos killed by poachers in South Africa in 2012.

"Middle-aged women are the nation's most powerful consumer group but they feel ignored by Britain's high street stores, according to a new report. Research has revealed that only one in five mature women feel well catered for on the High Street and 61 per cent actually feel that their age group is 'forgotten'. They feel ignored by youth-obsessed stores who are  focusing on fashion for younger women. Women aged 50-plus are the nation's 'most powerful consumer group', but they're 'being ignored' Sixty-six per cent of women questioned in a survey by fashion retailer JD Williams said they would like to see more choice from fashion retailers suited to their age group. The blind spot isn't just in our shops either - almost three out of five mature British women don't feel their age group is well represented in TV or magazines and three quarters feel they are not well represented in advertising. The study of 2,000 women aged 50-plus revealed they feel secure about their look, with only 19 per cent struggling to find their style identity. Almost three quarters rate comfort over style - with a good pair of jeans being their most favoured item of clothing. Almost three quarters (71 per cent) of women aged 50-plus rate comfort over style . While many of these women have a disposable income to spend on clothes, stores have not been wooing them to part with their cash, instead targetting younger customers. Only 16 per cent of mature women like to be loyal to a particular fashion store - so retailers have to go the extra mile to keep their custom. But it seems retailers should be doing more to appeal to this demographic as the over fifties market currently stands as the UK's fastest growing fashion sector. It is now worth £6.7bn and is emerging as Britain's most powerful consumer group. A JD Williams spokesperson said: 'There are more women in the 50 plus bracket than ever before and it's abundantly clear that they have felt let down by the fashion industry. We've made it our mission to address this. Shopping for clothes should be easy and enjoyable whether you're 16 or 60.' 'Recent years have seen this population of women emerge as the most powerful consumer group and the fastest growing fashion sector. No longer does 50 signal the start of the slow decline into old age, it now marks the midpoint of a woman's life. 'We hope this report heralds a wake-up call to the fashion, retail and media industries to give these women what they want, in the way we do. It's our job to empower; after all ignoring them should be done with peril.'","New report finds two thirds of 50-plus women feel 'forgotten'

"A 13-year-old girl has accepted a basketball scholarship at the University of Texas for the year 2020. Deja Kelly started dribbling at the age of three. By kindergarten she was playing fifth-graders, and when she reached fifth grade she was getting college offers.

Dozens of campuses have expressed interest in recruiting Deja, but she claims she has always dreamed of going to Texas, where her father Darren Kelly played for two seasons from 1999 to 2001. Her father insists he would have wanted her to wait to make the crucial decision. But nothing would change Deja's mind. Talented: Deja has been playing basketball since she was three years old and received offers from all over . Power: Basketball is Deja's life and she said she can't imagine backing down from the offer in years to come . Her mother and coach Theresa Nunn told ESPN: 'We are confident about the decision. 'I definitely think she made the right choice.' She has trained Deja since the age of three and they work together on the South Texas HOYAS team (Helping Our Youth Attain Scholarships). 'If basketball were taken away tomorrow,' Nunn said, 'she'd still be in love with the school.' Coach: Her mother Theresa Nunn played college basketball and has been Deja's coach for 10 years . Too soon? Her father Darren Kelly, who played for Texas, said he had hoped Deja would wait a bit to decide . 'I know kids change their minds on a daily basis,' Nunn said. 'But this is something she's been pretty concrete with for the past five or six years.' Although the contract cannot be written or binding, Deja says she cannot imagine backing down. She is not the first player to court interest years ahead of time.

"A notorious prison that has held some of France's most famous inmates has opened its heavily guarded doors while it undergoes a major renovation project. Now a series of fascinating new photographs reveal what life was like behind the razor wire topped walls of Paris' infamous La Santé jail over its colourful 147 year history.

The last 60 inmates left the crumbling prison in the summer to make way for the massive four year regeneration project. The jail is due to reopen in 2019 and will have 800 beds. In 2000 La Santé sparked a parliamentary inquiry after its chief medical officer, Véronique Vasseur, published a diary chronicling overcrowding and brutal conditions faced by inmates. At the time the jail, that was built to hold 1,400 inmates, housed 2,300 people.  Following the report a number of the most derelict blocks were closed and the four year revamp was ordered by justice minister Christiane Taubira. An official report published in 2012 highlighted the building's 'decrepit and humid walls,' and 'faulty window locks', among other defects.

"More than a thousand rail passengers were left stranded for up to eight hours aboard two Eurostar trains last night after a power cut in northern France. Furious travellers said they were left in pitch darkness with no fresh air or flushing toilets after a power cable  snapped above a section of track between Lille and Calais. One train travelling from London to Brussels with 600 passengers on board was held up from 8pm until 4.40am at which point a diesel-powered train finally arrived to move it on. Misery: Passengers aboard one of the stranded Eurostar trains are left in darkness following the power cut last night . Keeping their spirits up: Passengers seek refuge in the buffet car on the stranded Eurostar service between  London and Brussels . Tired: Passengers queue for security checks at London St Pancras in the early hours of the morning following their nightmare journey . Exhausted passengers who had expected to be in Brussels at 9.05pm finally arrived at around 6.10am. The second service between London and Paris which was carrying almost 700 passengers had been due to arrive at 9.17pm but only pulled in to Gare du Nord at around 3.15am after being left stranded for more than six hours. A spokesman for Eurostar admitted the passengers would have been left in the dark while the trains were stranded as they are completely dependent on power from the overhead lines and carry no emergency back-up. The beleagured passengers were handed out chocolate bars during their ordeal and were provided with taxis with some being put up at hotels when they finally arrived at their destinations. Later Eurostar services continued on Thursday night but trains were shunted onto low speed tracks meaning they were severely delayed. And the disruption  continued with at least three services cancelled on Friday morning with others facing delays. Eurostar said they anticipate problems will continue into the afternoon. Passengers took to Twitter to vent their anger with some posting pictures of their dark carriages. Many took refuge in the buffet car. One, Chris Littlecott, posted: ‘Left Brussels 19:52. Now waiting to enter Channel Tunnel 01:52. I only made it on to train at last minute. Wish I had missed it.’ Frederik Van Hecke ‏tweeted: ‘We are waiting for a diesel train to come and pull. If that would take too long buses would be coming to evacuate.’ Olya Dyachuk referred to a long haul flight to the West Indies, writing that it took ‘almost nine hours to get to London. Ridiculous. I could have been on Antigua by now! Eurostar were forced to apologise for the chaos and have offered refunds and free return trips to passengers affected. A spokesman for the firm said they had been unable to let passengers off the trains for safety reasons until a replacement train had arrived to collect them. He said: 'Unfortunately a broken overhead power cable has resulted in two Eurostar trains becoming stuck outside Lille and we are arranging to collect the passengers with a diesel train.' Blackout: Another picture posted on Twitter shows one of the Eurostar carriages in almost total darkness following the power cut in northern France . Stranded: Two Eurostar trains carrying a total of around 1,300 passengers were left stranded in northern France last night after an overhead power cable snapped near Lille (file picture) There have been a number of breakdowns on the cross-Channel service over the year, with the run up to Christmas 2009 being particularly disastrous. In late September of that year overhead power line dropped on to a train arriving at St Pancras station in London, activating a circuit breaker and delaying 11 other trains. Two days later power was lost on a section of line outside Lille, delaying passengers on two evening Eurostars.

"First lived in more than two centuries before William the Conqueror set foot on British soil, this ancient house is believed to be the longest continually inhabited home in the south of England. Dating back to 850, the Manor House in the pretty Wiltshire village of Downton, was once home to Sir Walter Raleigh, and is now for sale for £1.35million. The Grade I-listed five-bedroom, four-bathroom house was originally founded as a chapel in 850, after which it was transformed into a medieval hall house, and subsequently into a comfortable country home. The Manor House in Downton, Wiltshire, which was once home to Sir Walter Raleigh and counts Queen Elizabeth I among former guests, is for sale for £1.35million . The Raleigh family made substantial improvements to the house before Elizabeth I came to stay in 1586, and their coat of arms still stands over the fireplace . Under the eaves: The Raleighs' improvements to the house included the addition of the first floor, created by dismantling a ship they sailed up the River Avon . History: The flag of St George flies in Downton's St Laurence church just the other side of the walled garden, left, where explorer Sir Walter Raleigh, right, strolled . Sir Walter Raleigh leads a raid on the island of Trinidad in 1599 . Sir Walter Raleigh, born in 1552, fought with the Huguenots in France, and later in Ireland, where his role in suppressing a Munster uprising brought him to the attention of Elizabeth I.He soon became one of her favourites and was rewarded with a knighthood in 1585 . In 1591, Raleigh secretly married one of the queen's maids of honour, Elizabeth 'Bess' Throckmorton, who was 11 years younger and pregnant. Later Bess gave birth to their son, Damerei, but he died from the plague in 1592.When Elizabeth found out about Raleigh's unauthorised marriage, she was furious, and threw the couple into the Tower of London in June 1592. By this time Raleigh was back in favour with the queen, but this royal patronage expired with her death in 1603, . He was then accused of colluding with the Spanish in plotting against the king, Raleigh was sentenced to death. He spent the next 12 years writing the first volume of his 'History of the World' in the Tower.The adventurer was executed in October 1616 in Old Palace Yard, Westminster, after Raleigh had passed many opportunities to escape. His reputed last words, after being shown the axe that was to kill him, were 'Strike, man strike!' In the 16th century, Queen Elizabeth I leased the house from Winchester College, giving it first to Thomas Wilkes, Clerk to the Privy Council, and then to her favourite, Raleigh. In 1586 he invited the monarch to stay, but not before he made substantial improvements to the property, and the Raleigh family coat of arms still stands above the fireplace in the house's wooden panelled Great Parlour. Another improvement by the Raleigh family, who lived at the house for about a century, was the addition of a first floor, created with wood from a ship which had been sailed up the River Avon and then dismantled. Simon Jacobs, from Winkworth estate agent which is selling the Manor House, said: 'It is a wonderful family home with quite a history behind it. 'Even though it is a Grade I listed property, it still works well as a modern home and many reckon it's one of the longest privately lived in buildings in the area. 'The hall house was built in the 1400s, and it was the Raleighs who carried out a lot of the work on it.  They took a ship up the River Avon and then beached it before dismantling it and using the timber for the first floor and the staircase. 'It's a charming home and the timber underneath the chapel would have grown in the New Forest at around the time of the Conquest.' Described . as a 'special property which is perfect for entertaining', the Manor . House is tucked away next to the church in a peaceful corner of the . bustling village. It . comes with a 1.8 acre garden, which includes a walled kitchen garden, . formal gardens, paddock, large barn and parking, and views over . Cranborne Chase. The . village of Downton, which lies six miles outside Salisbury, has its own . primary and secondary schools, shops, doctors and dentist, and even an . annual Cuckoo Fair when children dance around a May pole. Estate Agents Strutt and Parker says the property is 'exceptional accommodation that is both beautifully situated and full of character.' The description continues: 'The principal reception rooms vary in style which has created a fascinating and eclectic blend of architectural styles, from the grand Tudor scale of the panelled Great Hall to the gothic study and the Regency proportions of the dining room.' In addition, there is a cottage located in the grounds of the Manor House, with two bedrooms and two reception rooms. The dining room at the Manor House, which has views over the lawns, must have been host to some interesting questions over its long history . The house is believed to be one of the longest continually inhabited homes in the south of England - this ancient wooden door bears testament to its age .

"Australia's Hockeyroos have won a titanic battle with old-rivals England in the Gold medal match at the Commonwealth Games. The unbeaten women's hockey side went in as favourites against England, but needed to score a last-minute equaliser to send the match into a penalty shootout.

It was then left to Lynch to defy the English raid on goal in the shootout, before captain Madonna Blyth coolly slotted home her penalty to claim the gold medal. A frustrated Hockeyroos earlier struggled to get their combinations working on a rain-soaked pitch which kept the match to a scoreless first half. Despite having more of the ball, and five extra shots on goal, the Australians could not break the deadlock and it was left to England 13 minutes after the break to score through Lily Owsley. The teenager lofted over the head of Lynch and into the back of the net, and it t wasn't until two minutes from time when the Australians earned their first penalty corner that they struck. From the resulting play, Anna Flanagan’s first shot was saved but the rebound fell to Jodie Kenny who flicked the ball on to equalise with just 16 seconds remaining.

"Scroll down for video . Michelle Obama and three of her family members are staying in a $8,350-per-night Beijing presidential suite, but despite a 24-hour butler and other perks that come with the lodging, her entourage has inconvenienced 'pretty much everyone' and made the hotel staff 'fed up,' a well-placed hotel staffer has told MailOnline. The sumptuous pad at the Westin Beijing Chaoyang hotel – its website calls the room 'an oasis of comfort – is a 3,400-square-foot masterpiece including a private steam room, 'corner sofas with silk pillows,' and in-room dining for six. But the Obamas' stay has already affected staff and guests at the hotel, with the Westin front-desk veteran alleging that Mrs. Obama's mother Marian Robinson has been 'barking at the staff since she arrived.' First lady Michelle Obama, her mother Marian Robinson, and her daughters Sasha and Malia are in Beijing for the beginning of a week-long tour, and their hotel's staff are already tired of them . A senior hotel staffer said Marian Robinson (L), Mrs. Obama's mother, has been 'barking at the staff since she arrived at the hotel . Can you spot the Secret Service? Many of the agents in Mrs. Obama's detail are Asian-American, helping them avoid standing out while they protect the first lady -- but confusing some hotel guests who don't understand why they can't board some elevators . Government security forces from both . China and the U.S. started Thursday to screen everyone who entered the . building, including paying guests, setting up checkpoints that resemble those at airline concourse entrances. The . Secret Service's monopoly on the hotel's highest floors has meant the Westin had to boot guests with previous reservations out of . their executive-level rooms. Secret Service agents are also monopolizing hotel elevators long before the . Obamas need them, added the staffer, who identified himself as a member . of the concierge staff and spoke English during a phone call on Friday. 'Many of them are Asian, too, or Americans who are Asian, so you know our guests don't understand.' 'We can't wait for this to be over, to tell you the truth,' he said in a sudden hush. 'We entertain many important people here, but this has been, I think, very different.' A spokesperson for Mrs. Obama declined to comment. The Westin Beijing Chaoyang's 'oasis' presidential suite isn't the only part of the hotel that the Obama's have monopolized: Their Secret Service contingent has allegedly bumped some high-paying guests from their rooms . A U.S. Secret Service spokesperson promised answers to MailOnline's questions but didn't provide any in time for publication. The agency generally does not speak publicly about security arrangements for the officials it protects. A spokesman for Starwood Hotels, which owns the Westin chain, referred questions to Secret Service. Ordinary Chinese who have met the American first lady have described her in media reports as approachable and friendly, and the hotel staffer agreed. 'The first lady is gracious, and the girls are lovely,' he said. The Westin employee and another colleague said Sasha and Malia Obama have been on their best behavior because Mrs. Robinson has kept them on a short leash. They emphasized that they have had a disappointing experience with the protection detail . that accompanies Mrs. Obama everywhere. Wealthy hotel guests bumped from their reserved rooms into other . less-luxurious accommodations have inundated the front desk with complaints. As a condition of the first lady . staying at the Westin, the Secret Service blocked off all . the rooms near the presidential suite.. The Washington Times reported Thursday that an entourage of about 70 people is accompanying the guests of honor to China at taxpayer expense. More guards than guarded? The two first ladies (front) strolled through Beijing's Forbidden City with their protection details close at hand . Blending in: The Secret Service detail guarding Mrs. Obama and her family members includes Asian-American agents like this man . 'Mrs. Diplomat': Chinese President Xi Jinping joined in Friday for events that were supposed to include just Mrs. Obama and Chinese first lady Peng Liyuan. The White House has insisted that the trip is a cultural exchange and not a political mission, however. Delightful: Ordinary Chinese have described Mrs. Obama as a wonderful visitor, but her mother (at C) is allegedly causing hotel staff headaches . The White House has taken pains to frame . Mrs. Obama's trip as a cultural journey rather than a political one, . but taxpayers are paying through the nose for it nonetheless. China News Service described the first lady on Friday as 'Mrs Diplomatic,' and the Xinhua news agency dubbed the trip 'an unprecedented and historical moment in the chapter of China–U.S. relations.' The trip won't come cheap. Judicial Watch, a watchdog group in Washington, D.C., reports that it cost more than $11 million for President and Mrs. Obama to travel to Africa for Nelson Mandela's memorial service in December. The first couple were in Africa for less than 13 hours. The Obamas' 2013 visit to Africa, a longer affair, reportedly cost Americans more than $100 million.","Michelle Obama, her daughters and her mother Marian Robinson are staying in a sumptuous presidential suite at a Beijing Westin hotel .

"One week before Thanksgiving, much of the nation is digging out from snowstorms, but the ground is bare in Alaska's largest city. Anchorage normally has nearly 17 inches of snowfall this time of year. Instead, it's seen less than four inches - and that snow fell a month ago and melted in unseasonably warmer weather. Without powder, local skiers are hitting the trails on roller skis or getting fit indoors. Some people are finding frozen lakes to skate on, even if it means leaving town. Others are celebrating. Scroll down for video . Chantz Gaither, a supervisor for Be Happy Home Maintenance, hangs holiday lights for the Alaska Railroad in downtown Anchorage, Alaska, on Thursday. This time of year, Anchorage normally has nearly 17 inches of snowfall. Instead, it's seen less than 4 inches . A light rain fell this week, only to later freeze into a slick layer on roads. So far, however, Anchorage's high this month was 48 degrees on November 10, instead of the norm of 29 degrees for that day, according to National Weather Service meteorologist Andy Dixon. The same system that is pushing frigid conditions from the north to the Lower 48 states is bringing warmer and drier conditions to Alaska's mainland from the south, Dixon said. It's sort of like trading places. 'It's not unprecedented by any means,' Dixon said Thursday. 'But it is unusual.' He said it should be winding down over the weekend and Anchorage temperatures should be back to equilibrium by the middle of next week. That means colder conditions but still no significant snow in the foreseeable forecast. While waiting for snow, some children are playing games and exercising to work on skills they eventually will use in a program of the Nordic Skiing Association of Anchorage. Tamra Kornfield, program manager for the association, has seen that waiting pattern over the years as a lifelong Anchorage resident. There are winters when snow is late to arrive, and snow lovers look for other forms of recreation.

But team members want snow and more snow. 'They're ready to get out there and do what they want to do,' Helvey said. 'That's ski.' The lack of snow is just fine with Ebony Toland, who moved to Alaska a year ago with her Army husband, who is stationed at Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson in Anchorage. Toland is originally from Batesburg-Leesville, South Carolina, and was excited when she experienced her first Alaska snowfall last year. But she said the novelty wore off after subsequent storms. Toland said she has no desire to build another snowman, and doesn't relish the thought of shoveling snow or keeping it out of her shoes. 'I think it looks prettier if it just stays in the mountains in the distance,' said Toland, an attorney practicing as a paralegal until she takes the state bar exam in February. 'If it just stayed there, it'd be great.' Buried: These residents of Buffalo got their car uncovered - but how are they going to get it out of their driveway?

"A judge has reinstated a sexual assault case against pitcher Evan Reed, overturning a decision by another judge who found inconsistencies in the woman's story. Reed is charged with third-degree criminal sexual conduct. He was playing for the Detroit Tigers last spring when a woman says she was drugged at a bar before Reed took her to a Detroit casino hotel on the eve of Opening Day. Ex-Tigers pitcher Evan Reed appears in court on a sexual assault charge in Detroit in August . Wayne County Judge Michael Callahan heard an appeal  Friday and reinstated the case. It had been dismissed in August. Back then, a judge said the testimony of the woman who accused him wasn't credible and prosecutors failed to show that force or coercion took place. 'Her lies caught up with her,' Reed, who insists the sex was consensual, said after the hearing . Reed said back then that he was 'elated' to be cleared of the third-degree criminal sexual conduct charges. He was with the Tigers at the time of the incident and appeared in 27 games for Detroit before being sent to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He's a free agent now. Reed wasn't in court Friday. His defense attorney, Ben Gonek, said Reed was interrogated for hours and didn't commit a crime. Reed was playing with the Tigers at the time of the incident and appeared in 27 games for Detroit before being sent to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens. He's a free agent now . The 45-year-old woman testified that she met Reed at a bar in the suburb of Royal Oak on March 30 and that they later went to a casino in downtown Detroit. She said she 'blacked out' after taking a drink that tasted 'sour' and that she believes had been drugged. The Detroit Free Press reports that surveillance video from that night show the woman falling off a sidewalk onto her back without attempting to brace herself at all. Reed is then seen carrying the woman into the hotel building. But Judge Kenneth King said there was no evidence the woman was raped inside the hotel. The judge said the woman appeared to be unimpaired when she walked down a set of stairs, despite claiming she didn't have the presence of mind to take the elevator. 'She wasn’t wobbling, she wasn't falling, she wasn't stumbling,' King said, according to reports. 'And she was wearing high heels. Evan Reed (center) appears in court with his attorneys in August . Reed has insisted that the sexual encounter was consensual, while the alleged victim says she thinks she was drugged . The woman testified that she was on her third vodka tonic when she noticed the drink tasted particularly sour. Her next memory is waking up naked in bed with Reed. The woman described what happened in graphic detail after she awoke the following morning during her hour-and-a-half testimony. 'Everything was spinning, my head was hurting,' she said. 'I remember getting up and kind of holding on to the wall and going into the bathroom.' She noticed a foul smell and a stain on the sheets; she said she got into the shower where Reed allegedly tried to have anal sex with her. She told him no and went back to the bed. 'My mind was telling me all I wanted to do was go back and sleep,' she said, reports CBS.","The case against pitcher Evan Reed was dropped in August after a Detroit judge said there wasn't enough evidence to proceed .

"A 'cowardly' killer who stabbed a City worker in the back in a case of mistaken identity outside a crowded pub has been jailed for 23 years today. Aytach Lisani, 33, plunged a knife into the back of 34-year-old Christopher Foster in an alleyway in Borough, south London last November, after mistaking him for another man. Mr Foster, who worked for a law firm and was a single father to his four year-old daughter, had been enjoying a last drink with an old school friend when he was attacked from behind. Christopher Foster, left, who died after being stabbed in an alleyway in Borough, south London last year. Today Aytach Lisani, right, was jailed for 23 years after pleading guilty to murder . He suffered catastrophic internal injuries and died an hour later in hospital. Lisani, who was at the head of a seven-strong group searching for the intended target, who cannot be named for legal reasons, pleaded guilty to murder on the first day of his trial at the Old Bailey. Today Judge Gerald Gordon sentenced Lisani to life imprisonment with a minimum of 23 years before parole. Sentencing him, he said: ‘You accept being the man who can be seen on the CCTV making your way up the alleyway were Christopher Foster was innocently standing with his friend. ‘You thrust a large knife forcefully into his back, thereby killing him, not only destroying his own life but also wrecking the lives of his young daughter and his close family. ‘Mr Foster was a complete stranger to the revenge that was being sought. ‘This was the use of a knife in a public place with other innocent people around. CCTV footage shows the gang approaching the pub in Borough, south London where Mr Foster, 34, was killed . ‘It is quite difficult to square the man who committed the cowardly acts you did that night with a man who has reached the age of 33 without conviction or caution.’ Before the sentence was passed, Mr Foster’s mother Jean entered the witness box to read a moving statement about the impact of his death. She described Christopher Foster as ‘a son to be proud of, a brother to look up to, a loyal friend and devoted loving father.’ Mrs Foster said: ‘He left a lasting impression on those he met wherever he went. He was a kind and generous person.

He really was a good person to have around.’ Mr Foster had won custody of his young daughter Christina in June 2010 and was planning to visit her at his parent’s house the day after he was killed, the court heard. Mrs Foster added: ‘He was such a good father, a real hands-on dad. Christina will never see her father again. 'Nobody sees what Christina goes through, it has been heartbreaking hearing her pleas for daddy to come back. ‘I had to sit her down and tell her that her daddy had died. The precious person in Christina’s life has been taken away from her.’ Mrs Foster said that she and her husband were still fighting an expensive battle for guardianship in the family courts. Billy Dove, who admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm, and was jailed for six-and-a-half years . ‘We have not been able to properly grieve for our son as we have been consumed with trying not to lose our granddaughter too', she said. ‘Our fight in the family court will continue into the New Year and beyond. The end of this trial is not the end of our anguish.’ ‘We feel robbed of our son. Our hopes and dreams have been shattered and filled with fears and worries. I cannot even begin to describe the void in our lives, a void that will never be filled.’ Five other men accused of playing a part in the attack were cleared of murder after the prosecution dropped the charge. However, three of them admitted conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm. Rocky Djelal, 34, was jailed for six years; Billy Dove, 30, for six and a half years; and Ali Lisani, 38 for seven and a half years. The judge told them: 'You have each pleaded guilty to being a party to a conspiracy to cause (the intended target) grievous bodily harm. 'You were each part of a group who were all together by the time you turned the corner and made your way up the alleyway alongside St Christopher's Inn in pursuit. 'That was in revenge for an earlier attack on your friend Salih. 'You Dove set the ball rolling with your call to Salih tipping him off to the presence of [the intended target]. 'You Ali Lisani were armed with a baseball bat. 'The Crown accept you are not to be held responsible for the murder in any way save for being party to the creation of the circumstances that enabled the murder to happen. 'But it is inconceivable that anyone involved in that conspiracy did not realise others of the group might be armed with some form of weapon bearing in mind the purpose of the attack and what it was revenge for.' Mr Foster was stabbed outside the St Christopher's Inn pub, pictured, while enjoying his last drink with a friend . Ricky Huggins, a 30 year-old jobbing actor who had been due to appear as an extra in Our Kind of Traitor starring Ewan McGregor, and property consultant Mohammed Aalamani, also 30, were both cleared of conspiracy to commit grievous bodily harm and walked free from court. A seventh suspect, Aydin Salih, is believed to have fled to Cyprus. The murder took place outside St Christopher’s Inn in Borough High Street during the early hours of 30 November 2013. Mr Foster, who had worked for ten years as an office porter at international law firm Pinsent Masons in the City of London, was standing outside with his friend Danny Murphy. His attackers had wrongly believed him to be another man, who they blamed for an attack on Aydin Salih, the cousin of Aytach Lisani and an associate of others in the group, the court heard. Flowers were left at the scene in tribute to the father-of-one, who was targeted in a revenge attack . Salih, who is in Cyprus, was treated at St Thomas's Hospital after he was attacked on September 20 last year, the court was told. Prosecutor David Fisher QC: ‘They were having a last drink outside as were a number of people. ‘The atmosphere in that alleyway was good but events were interrupted by a group of approximately seven men whose faces were obscured with hoods and scarves they were wearing. ‘Christopher Foster had his back to the group until the very last minute when he turned. ‘The two men decided to go into the pub but before they could do so Christopher Foster was stabbed once in his back. ‘Both men managed to get into the pub but Christopher Foster had been seriously injured and collapsed. ‘Emergency services were called but despite the efforts of doctors and paramedics both at the scene and at hospital Mr Foster died about an hour and a half after he had been stabbed.’ Mr Fisher said the victim was a ‘totally innocent man’ who had been mistaken for another man who cannot be named because of a court order. He continued: ‘Christopher Foster had not said or done anything at all that could begin to explain why he was stabbed.’","Christopher Foster, 34, died after being stabbed outside a pub last year .

"The founder of an app that lets Bitcoin users send the virtual currency privately has admitted he expects people will use it to buy drugs. However, Cody Wilson added he wanted to give people ‘freedom’ to break the law if they wanted to, by using an untraceable system of payment. He continued that he wanted Dark Wallet - a simple plug-in that sits discreetly on users’ internet browsers - to be ‘crisis-forcing’ and change the way we spend money, even if that means on narcotics. Scroll down for video . Bitcoin transactions are recorded in a virtual public ledger, known as the blockchain. Miners are in charge of maintaining the blockchain. As their computers perform the calculations to do that, the process rewards them with newly minted bitcoins . Encrypted and difficult-to-trace pieces of code that function like cash - called Bitcoin - can be exchanged over the internet. But current Bitcoin wallets, in a world where there are no bank accounts and are used to virtually store the coins and make transactions, can be complex. Dark Wallet is designed to be simpler and encourage people who are not tech savvy to store and use the virtual currency. The app and plug-in will protect a Bitcoin user's anonymity and money. It is hoped Dark Wallet, which will work on Firefox and Chrome browsers, will accelerate the currency's rate of adoption around the world. It will be open source and free when it launches, which is expected to be early this year. Dark Wallet will supposedly return Bitcoin to its ‘anarchist’ roots after it became targeted by law enforcement in the U.S. for its alleged ties to criminality. It will be an app and plug-in for the Chrome and Firefox browsers and will allow users to store, send and receive Bitcoin, only with extra security. Dark Wallet is expected to be completed early this year and will be free to use. Mr Wilson, a law school dropout, has become something of an internet provocateur having already posted details about a plastic gun he made with a 3D printer. The 25-year-old also put the blueprints online so that anybody could download them, attracting attention from the FBI. Speaking to the Wall Street Journal, Mr Wilson said: ‘We need an anonymous cash online. ‘It's not that I want you to buy drugs. It's just that I think you should have the freedom to do it.’ He added that Dark Wallet ‘captures everything we want to do’ and that ‘my particular brand of activism is crisis-forcing.’ In . a promotional Fight Club style video posted to YouTube for Dark Wallet, Wilson says that . ‘Bitcoin is what they fear it is.’ Mr Wilson has raised $100,000 (£60,600) for the project through online donations and another $150,000 (£91,000) through other sources, with most of the money being donated in Bitcoin. He only began focusing his attention on Dark Wallet after his plastic gun, called ‘Liberator’, was effectively banned by the U.S. State Department. It told him to remove the blueprints from the internet as they were in breach of arms export laws. Bitcoin’s . security has been called into question recently after the FBI arrested . the founder of Silk Road, which is allegedly the biggest Internet drugs . market in the word. Ross .

He has now been charged with allegedly . engaging in a drug trafficking, money laundering, conspiracy as well as . computer hacking and attempted murder-for-hire. Silk Road, which allowed users to trade in illegal drugs, required transactions to be made using the virtual currency Bitcoin . Stephen Hudak, a spokesman for the U.S. government's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, said it would be monitoring the situation. He said: ‘We'd be concerned about anything that would increase the threat level of money laundering.’ In mid-December the Bitcoin virtual currency passed the $1,000 (£613) mark for the first time since it was introduced in 2009. Analysts claim the demand for Bitcoin follows increased awareness about benefits of the currency and a drive to move it into the mainstream. The digital currency is increasingly being treated like gold, with some investors using it to hedge against currency fluctuations and speculating on its rise. Bitcoins can be bought with near anonymity, which supporters say lowers fraud risk and increases privacy.","Dark Wallet app and web plug-in was created by U.S-based Cody Wilson .

"Ryan Johnson is Stevenage's youngest ever player and is training with Manchester United . Manchester United are taking a look at Stevenage Borough centre back Ryan Johnson. The 18-year-old is joining up with United at their Carrington training complex after impressing scouts with his performances for Stevenage and their Under 18s. Johnson started at West Bromwich Albion, where he spent seven years as a schoolboy and was offered a scholarship. However, he believed he had a better chances of breaking through at Stevenage and made the switch there in 2013. They gave him a two-year scholarship and he quickly impressed, began training with the first team and signed professional terms a year early. He was on the substitutes' bench a number of times last season before making his debut in May in the 2–0 defeat by Brentford. He became Stevenage's youngest ever debutant at the age of 17 years and 215 days. Johnson played at left back in the game but earned glowing praise from manager Graham Westley. He'll spend a week at United in the hope of impressing staff. Newport County's 16-year-old defender Regan Poole, who also had a training spell at United earlier this season, will complete his move to Fulham in the next few days but will be loaned back to the League Two promotion chasers for the rest of the season. Juan Cuadrado (right) is hot property at Fiorentina and has attracted Chelsea's interest . Meanwhile, Manchester United have not stepped into the race for Juan Cuadrado. Chelsea remain in talks with Fiorentina about the player's £26.8million buy-out and reports in Italy say that United have shown an interest and offered Adnan Januzaj on loan to sweeten the deal. However, United remain focused on deals for the summer with a centre back and right back the priority. A winger is on the agenda while they will also take stock of what strikers are available. QPR will not be pursuing a deal for Monaco striker Dimitar Berbatov. Monaco will allow the 33-year-old to leave for £1m and Berbatov's family are keen on a return to London. Crystal Palace, Everton and Hull have also been sounded out but the Bulgarian is looking for wages of £70,000 a week. Berbatov is one of several big names available in the window and clubs are weighing up the gamble as they look to stay in the Premier League this season. Monaco are prepared to let Dimitar Berbatov leave while Alexandre Pato (right) wants to move to England . Alexandre Pato is another who QPR have turned down, as have Hull. The Brazilian is only 25 but has lost the sparkle he showed while at AC Milan and is keen to revive his career and profile with a move to England. Pato's loan fee from Corinthians is £1.5m while his wage demands are £75,000-a-week. Some clubs have explored paying him less with a £1m bonus at the end should they stay up. Similar proposals have been made to Berbatov's camp. Everton and West Brom have also spoken about Pato but Hull's board believe the deal is too rich a gamble. Darren Fletcher is continuing talks with clubs on Wednesday. The 30-year-old has a favourable offer from West Ham while West Brom are keen to speak to him again. A preferred deal to Valencia looks unlikely at this stage. United are willing to make a financial contribution to the Scotland international's move. Wigan are poised to follow up the signing of Inverness striker Billy McKay with a £1.5m double swoop on Leeds United. Sportsmail revealed at the weekend that Malky Mackay had opened talks to bring in centre back Jason Pearce from Elland Road and he has now added Leeds midfielder Rodolph Austin to the deal. The clubs were discussing the fee on Tuesday night as Northern Ireland international McKay arrived in a £150,000 deal. Rodolph Austin is one of two Leeds players, along with Jason Pearce, targeted Wigan in a £1.5m swoop . Cardiff had shown a strong interest in Austin but Malky Mackay looks to have persuaded the Jamaica captain to turn down his former club for a greater challenge at the DW Stadium. Wigan face a tough battle to stay up and are now eight points behind Rotherham, who beat Bolton on Tuesday night. They have agreed to sell Adam Forshaw to Middlesbrough and Callum McManaman to West Brom but shedding their wages should allow Mackay room to bring in a few loans also for the fight ahead. Wigan have also had an offer rejected for 23-year-old Feyenoord striker Mitchell te Vrede. Derby Couty have asked about taking Tom Ince on loan from Hull City. Manager Steve McClaren has attempted to prise Junior Hoilett and Matt Phillips from QPR but the Loftus Road club will only sell rather than loan. McClaren said: 'We are a bit light in that area and we are looking to do something in the loan market in the next couple of days.' Wigan, Bournemouth and Middlesbrough have also asked about Ince who is on the periphery at Hull despite their injury crisis. Manager Steve Bruce is continuing to search for a striker. Tom Ince is out of favour at Hull but Steve McClaren wants to take him on loan at Derby . However, Nikica Jelavic and Abel Hernandez are both in line for surprise returns from injury against Newcastle United on Saturday. Both were expected to be ruled out for up to six weeks with injuries but they took part in a full training session during City’s warm-weather training camp in Portugal on Tuesday. Swansea City are considering a move for Blackburn striker Rudy Gestede. The 26-year-old is valued at £6m by the Championship side and so far no club has matched their valuation. Crystal Palace made a £3.5m offer over a week ago but that was rejected and they were expected to return with another offer. Hull and West Brom pulled out at an early stage believing the player was overpriced. However, Swansea were impressed by his performance against them at the weekend and are contemplating a move. Garry Monk insisted he would not be following up any interest in Jordan Rhodes and that he was not looking to add a striker, but with recent results he may go for extra security before the window closes. Rudy Gestede (second right) leaps to score against Swansea in the FA Cup last Saturday . Crystal Palace hope to agree terms with Shola Ameobi but are reluctant to allow Fraizer Campbell to join QPR. Rangers asked for Campbell as part of a deal for Jordon Mutch as Palace have fallen short on their valuation of the former Cardiff midfielder. QPR want around £5m for the 23-year-old Mutch unless they can persuade Palace to give them Campbell, 27, as part of the deal. Ameobi, 33, was at Palace's training ground for further talks on Tuesday as reported in Sportsmail. His signing would leave Alan Pardew with six strikers on his books. Fraizer Campbell (second left) is wanted by QPR as part of a deal to sell Jordon Mutch . Middlesbrough are monitoring developments with James Morrison at West Bromwich Albion. Manager Aitor Karanka signed Adam Forshaw from Wigan on Wendesday morning but wants another attacking midfielder and has designs on Morrison, who the club asked about last year. Morrison has been starting under Tony Pulis but Middlesbrough want to test Albion's resolve to keep him. They have enquired about a loan for Graham Dorrans but Albion will only sell and want around £3million for the Scotland international. Middlesbrough are set to make another enquiry about West Brom midfielder James Morrison . Sheffield United head into their Capital One Cup semi-final against Tottenham with the future of teenager Diego De Girolamo shrouded in doubt. The 19-year-old, who scored against Preston in the FA Cup, is out of contract in the summer and new terms have yet to agreed. Girolamo, born in Chesterfield, has played for Italy Under 20s and had a recent spell on loan with Russ Wilcox at York. Charlton, meanwhile, are maintaining the Belgian theme at the club by targeting 30-year-old midfielder and former Belgium international Christophe Lepoint at KAA Gent. Diego De Girolamo scored for Sheffield United at Deepdale in the FA Cup last Saturday . St Etienne are hoping to strike up an alliance with Manchester City involving their youth academy. City maintain no formal deal is in place but good relations between the clubs has seen City send representatives to the French club’s training ground to discuss facilities and possible exchanges. St Etienne are currently giving a trial to Manchester City youngster Divine Naah. The Ghanian 18-year-old attacking midfielder had recently returned from a loan at Stromsgodset.","Stevenage Borough defender Ryan Johnson is on trial at Carrington .

"The European Union will crumble if it does not return half of its powers to members states, former French president Nicolas Sarkozy has said. Sarkozy, who is once again campaigning to lead the country, claims ’the system will explode’ if the EU continues to work in its current Brussels-centric form. The 59-year-old said the EU should only deal with industry, agriculture, competition, trade negotiations, energy and research. Scroll down for video . Nicolas Sarkozy claims the EU will 'explode' if Brussels do not hand back 50 per cent of its power . Speaking from Mulhouse, near the German border, as part of his campaign to become leader of the UMP party once more, Sarkozy said: ’Europe must give back 50 per cent of its competences to member states.’ ’If not, the system is going to explode.’ ‘I no longer believe in the possibility of changing things in Europe from the inside,’ he told the audience according to The Times. Sarkozy has promised that, if he is re-elected as president in 2017, that he will withhold all French business with the EU until Brussels meets his demands for reform. This follows his controversial promise to ‘repeal’ Socialist legislation allowing same-sex unions. 'They have this much power': Sarkozy, who is once against attempting to win the French Presidency, said the EU should only deal with industry, agriculture, competition, trade negotiations, energy and research . Sarkozy is set to regain the leadership of the conservative UMP party, and the remarks came during a debate in Paris between the three candidates hoping to lead the conservative UMP party into the 2017 presidential election. He said the May 2013 law which legalised gay adoption ‘should be written from the ground up’. The predominantly right-wing audience chanted ‘Repeal! Repeal!’, and Mr Sarkozy said: ‘If you prefer that I say repeal the law, it comes down to the same thing.’ Mr Sarkozy did nothing for homosexuals who wanted to marry during his single term as President between 2007 and 2012. The vast majority of French people are at least nominally Catholic, and there has been huge opposition to President Francois Hollande’s liberal social policies. However, an Ifop poll published on Saturday showed 68 per cent of the French were in favour of same-sex unions. It also showed that 53 per cent of the country supported adoption by homosexual couples. Despite facing a long list of corruption enquiries, Mr Sarkozy is convinced he can become head of state again in three years. He has increasingly placed himself to the right of the political agenda, mainly in response to the increasing success of the far-right National Front. Not invited? While Sarkozy was talking about the EU, his successor Francois Hollande (left) and predecessor Jacques Chirac (right) were at the Quai Branly museum in Paris for the Jacques Chirac Foundation .","Nicolas Sarkozy demands the EU hand back 50 per cent of power .

DNA found on Dominique Allen's sandals and body matched samples from 46-year-old William Gholston in the state inmate database, Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said. Investigators say Gholston snatched Allen from her sister's porch early on Aug. 21, according to WISHTV. Charged: William Gholston, 46,  of Indianapolis has been charged in the killing of 15-year-old Dominique Allen whose badly burned body was found in an Indianapolis backyard . Snatched: Allen was snatched from her sister's porch on Aug. 21, Gholston is then believed to have taken her to an abandon house . She was taken to an abandoned house then carried across a busy street before being burned and buried. Investigators don't know of any connection between Allen and Gholston, who wasn't initially a suspect in the slaying, Curry said. A coroner determined that Allen was strangled to death. Her body was found later that day by a man walking his dog, WISHTV reports, her body was badly burned, which police believed was done to get rid of any DNA evidence. 'It was the DNA match in the database which brought Mr. Gholston's name to the attention of the detectives,' he said during a news conference. Since the teen's murder, her family has been eager to find her killer. They even offered a $3,000 reward at the beginning of the month to anyone with information leading to an arrest in the case, IndyStar reports. Badly Burned: Later in the day after her abduction, Allen's body was found badly burned behind a house nearby . Conference: In a news conference,  Marion County Prosecutor Terry Curry said that DNA found on Allen's sandals and body matched body samples from Gholston . Family: Since the teen's murder, her family has been eager to find her killer. They even offered a $3,000 reward at the beginning of the month to anyone with information leading to an arrest in the case . Gholston was released from prison in May after serving a sentence for 2006 convictions on illegal gun possession and resisting arrest charges. He previously served prison sentences for armed robbery and drug possession, according to Indiana Department of Correction records. WISHTV reports that Gholston faced murder charges in 2002, but the charges were dropped when a key witness changed his story. Curry said Gholston was arrested in the northeastern Indiana city of Bluffton this month for a parole violation. Court records didn't list an attorney for Gholston and an initial court hearing on the murder charge wasn't immediately scheduled Friday. Gholston told police investigators that he wasn't in Indianapolis in August and knew nothing about Allen's death, Curry said. The address Gholston gave for his parole was near where her body was found, but it wasn't clear when or whether he ever lived in the neighborhood.. The teen's purse and shoes were discovered about a block from where her body was found, according to police. Several of Allen's relatives and friends held hands and prayed in a circle after the news conference announcing the charges. Police are now investigating whether Gholston is connected to the murders of three other women who were strangled to death in Indianapolis, WISHTV reports. Edna Wilson was found strangled to death in October and Loy Ofsthun and Selese Goss were murdered in June.

"When a group of people heard a rumour that the new Kmart store was giving away free gift vouchers for the first 50 shoppers, they jumped at every opportunity to camp overnight in a bid to not miss out. But after 14 hours of queuing in wet weather and peeing into bottles, three nursing students were left feeling disappointed only to be given five dollar vouchers. NorthTec students Lee Howard-Mizsey, Izzy Cooke and Ashleigh Ingham slept outside the retailer chain ahead of the official opening at the Okara Shopping Centre in Whangarei in New Zealand on Wednesday night. Kmart store in New Zealand gave away free 'gift vouchers' ahead of official opening . Ms Howard-Mizsey, who arrived at the store at 7pm, even brought her laptop along to finish off an assessment that was due the following day. 'There were a few showers too overnight and it was cold at 2am, but we were cosy enough,' Ms Howard-Mizsey told Northern Advocate. By 11pm,  nine people rocked up after hearing the same rumours about the gift voucher freebies. But when a number of people camped overnight, they were only given $5 vouchers . But when the 90 shoppers rushed through the doors as it opened at 7.30am, the three women were handed two five dollar vouchers to share between them. 'That was disappointing. We camped out for 14 hours. We had to pee into a bottle,' Ms Howard-Mizsey said. Despite their brave cold temperatures to camp overnight, Ms Howard-Mizsey said it was still a good experience. 'We had fun. I'd do it all again,' she said.","Kmart store gave away free 'gift vouchers' ahead of official opening .

"Police sting: A seven metre wasp nest was found by police at an empty house on the island of Tenerife . A seven metre long wasps nest has reportedly been discovered in an abandoned house by police officers in Spain. Officers were called to the empty property in San Sebastian de La Gomera on the island of Tenerife after a series of calls from concerned neighbours. Police sealed off the home when the found the 22ft nest, which is said to have almost filled a room, and millions of wasps in the house, according to UPI.com. Experts believe that the nest was built by an African species of wasp which had migrated to Tenerife. The Canary Islands are located around 100km from the African coast. Police are said to be trying to find out who the property belongs to. The nest may well be the biggest ever found. According to the Guinness Book of World Records, the largest one found to date was discovered in Waimaukau in New Zealand in April 1963 and was an impressive 3.7metres, or 12ft 2ins long, more than 5ft in diameter and 18ft in circumference. Thought to have been created by German wasps, that nest was so heavy that it fell from the tree it was hanging in and broke in two. The size, type and colour of a wasps nest depends on the species of wasp that builds it. They tend to be predominantly made from paper pulp - the wasp gathers wood fibres from weathered wood and softens it by chewing and mixing with saliva. The previous biggest nest in the last 50 years was discovered in the attic of a pub in Southampton, Hampshire, in 2010. Measuring 6ft by 5ft the nest was home to an estimated 500,000 wasps. Another giant nest was found at the Avery Garden Centre in Taunton, Somerset last summer. The average common wasp nest contains around 4,000 to 5,000 wasps - but colonies have been known to reach populations of 20,000. Extraordinary: Experts believe that the huge nest is too big to have been built by common wasps (pictured) and is most likely to have been the creation of a species of migrant wasps from Africa .","The nest was reportedly found at a property on the island of Tenerife .

"Online Christmas shopping is set to start early, with auction site eBay predicting that Sunday November 30 will be its busiest day of the year. Cyber Monday, which falls on December 1, is traditionally the busiest online shopping day, as buyers rush to make sure all their orders arrive on time. The website 'tends to see a sharp rise in sales' on this particular day each year as people start to think about their festive shopping lists early. Online auction site eBay predicting that Sunday 30th November will be its busiest day of the year . The rush for the checkout is thought to be partly as a result of warnings that delivery companies may not be able to cope with a huge increase in the number of parcels sent. The day has been dubbed Super Sunday and comes hot on the heels of Black Friday, which precedes it by two days. Falling  on November 28th, Black Friday is seen as the start of the biggest High Street shopping weekend of the year. On Super Sunday, eBay estimates that 1,800 gifts will be purchased per minute from a selection of more than 800 million items available in total. Since the launch of the site's Christmas Shop,  tech, lifestyle and classic toys have proved the most popular presents among shoppers so far. Xbox, iPad, Bose Sound Bar, Lego and Playmobil are among the brands set to take prime position under trees across the nation, report their analysts. The day dubbed Super Sunday  comes hot on the heels of Black Friday, which precedes it by two days . Nevertheless, traditional guests remain popular with five teddy bears, 57 board games, 85 games consoles, 99 tablets, 258 mobile phones and 318 handbags already sold every hour on the site. Black Friday began in the US but has now spread to the UK and sees retailers slash prices as they attempt to kickstart a Christmas rush. It got its name because it was traditionally said to be the point at which American retailers began to turn a profit for the year, or go 'into the black'. Visa Europe reported that on Black Friday last year, Britons spent £1 million every three minutes to snap up the best deals in the shops - equal to an astonishing £6,000 per second. Cyber Monday, meanwhile, is a more recent phenomenon and takes place the Monday after Thanksgiving Day in the US. It is the internet equivalent of Black Friday, allowing shoppers to skip the hustle and bustle of the shops and purchase all their presents from the comfort of their sofa.","Site expected to reach fever pitch between 8-9pm Sunday November 30 .

"British men and women suffer the same 3.6 per cent loss between the ages of 45-49 . Whilst older men aged 65-70 fare worse with a 9.6 per cent drop in comparison with the 7.4 for their female counterparts . Memory and other brain skills begin to decline at the age of 45 – much earlier than previously thought, say researchers. A major study shows the brain's capacity for memory, reasoning and comprehension starts waning in middle age rather than in the 60s. Experts say the finding is important because younger people should be encouraged to boost their brain power with healthier living, while some may benefit from medicines to stave off further decline. Question marks raised: Men and women suffer brain loss as early as their mid-40s . With an ageing population – one in four Britons will be older than 65 by the year 2035 – doctors claim ‘cognitive ageing will be one of the challenges of this century’. Researchers from the Centre for Research in Epidemiology and Population Health in France and University College London in the UK studied more than 7,000 people over a 10-year period. The study looked at civil servants aged between 45 and 70 working in London when cognitive testing began in 1997 to 1999. Cognitive function was measured three times over 10 years to assess memory, vocabulary, hearing and visual comprehension skills. Tasks included recalling in writing as many words beginning with the letter S as possible and as many animal names as could be thought of. All cognitive scores, except vocabulary, declined among all age groups during the study, and there was evidence of faster decline among older people. In men, there was a 3.6 per cent drop in reasoning after 10 years among those who were aged 45 to 49 at the start of the study and 9.6 per cent among those aged 65 to 70. In women, the decline was 3.6 per cent and 7.4 per cent in the same age groups, says a report published online in the British Medical Journal (must credit). Dr Archana Singh-Manoux, who led the study, said there had been debate over when mental skills started failing, with some researchers concluding there was little evidence of problems before 60. But this was disproved by the study findings, she added. She said ‘Cognitive decline is already evident in middle age, between 45-49 years. ‘The results for all tests, except vocabulary, showed significant declines in all age categories in both men and women.’ The study says diseases such as dementia are believed to take at least 20 to 30 years to develop but promoting healthy lifestyles and good heart health could help. ‘There is emerging consensus that 'what is good for our hearts is also good for our heads', making aggressive control of behavioural and cardiovascular risk factors as early as possible key targets for clinical practice and public health’ it said. Medicines and other medical interventions are more likely to work at an earlier age, so could be used in people whose cognitive decline is faster than the average, it said. Previous research suggests around half of people with diagnosed mild cognitive impairment (MCI) develop Alzheimer’s. In cases of MCI, a person has cognitive or memory problems which are more marked than typical age-related memory loss, but not yet as severe as those found in Alzheimer’s disease. Dr Simon Ridley, head of research at Alzheimer’s Research UK charity, said ‘Experts believe that Alzheimer’s disease, the most common cause of dementia, begins to develop in mid-life. Researchers for the Alzheimer's society said the results are unclear as to whether people then go on to suffer from dementia . ‘Although this study didn’t look at dementia, it would be important to follow up these participants to see which people go on to develop the condition, and it would be helpful to see similar studies carried out in a wider sample. ‘Previous research suggests that our health in mid-life affects our risk of dementia as we age, and these findings give us all an extra reason to stick to our New Year’s resolutions. ‘Although we don’t yet have a sure-fire way to prevent dementia, we do know that simple lifestyle changes – such as eating a healthy diet, not smoking, and keeping blood pressure and cholesterol in check – can all reduce the risk of dementia. ‘With 820,000 people in the UK affected by dementia, it’s vital that we invest in research to find new ways to prevent and treat this devastating condition.’ Dr Anne Corbett, research manager of the Alzheimer’s Society, said ‘This large, important study adds vital information to the debate over when cognitive decline begins. 'However, the study does not tell us whether any of these people went on to develop dementia, nor how feasible it would be for GPs to detect these early changes. ‘More research is now needed to help us fully understand how measurable changes in the brain can help us improve diagnosis of dementia. 'An early diagnosis is essential as it can provide access to support and potential treatments which can vastly improve people’s quality of life.’","British men and women suffer the same 3.6 per cent loss between the ages of 45-49 .
