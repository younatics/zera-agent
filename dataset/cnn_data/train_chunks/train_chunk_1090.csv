"TSA screeners at Newark Liberty International Airport lost a woman who reportedly tested positive for explosives on Sunday and only put the airport on lock-down when she boarded a flight to Cleveland, Ohio. Earlier in the day, the Transportation Security Administration at the airport misplaced a piece of checked luggage that had also tested positive for explosives and couldn't find it for 45 minutes. The bomb squad cleared the oversize bag -- but only two and a half hours after it was discovered. The security failures caused more than 100 flights at the busy airport to be cancelled and dozens more delayed as furious passengers waited for hours -- only to learn their planes were not going to take off. Scroll down for video . Furious: Fliers stood in line for hours after the security bungle at Newark Liberty International Airport . Scare: This is the test that flagged an over-sized checked bag -- which the TSA then lost for 45 minutes and sent to the tarmac . About 8.45am, a woman slipped through a TSA checkpoint at Terminal C before being fully screened. Fox 5 New York reported that the woman was flagged in a preliminary test for explosives. The TSA refused to comment on the report that possible explosives were involved. Security officials somehow lost track of the woman and allowed her into the terminal. That's when officials put the airport on lock down 'out of an abundance of caution,' according to a TSA statement. Authorities only realized the woman had boarded her flight once it had already landed in Cleveland, the Newark Star-Ledger reported. The woman was never questioned or screened again and officials do not know her name or identity. Two hours prior, at 6.30am, a routine screening flagged an over-sized checked bag as possibly containing explosives, Fox New York reports. Grounded: The security breach brought flights at Newark to a halt on Sunday -- but this was not the first time this has happened . That bag also slipped through the hands of security agents and made it to the tarmac, where it sat for more than 45 minutes before it was discovered. The Essex County Sheriff's Office bomb squad was called and inspected the bag two hours later and found no threat. This is only the latest blunder for the TSA in Newark. In June, eight screeners were fired sleeping on duty after photos emerged of a TSA employee reportedly dozing in front of a monitor when she was supposed to be looking out for bombs. The TSA at Newark Liberty International Airport is headed by Don Drummer, who has been in the post a little over a year. The TSA issued only a short statement about the breach and declined to answer questions about how it happened. A spokeswoman said only that the agency was going to 'review the situation.' Passengers on Sunday were furious about the cancellations. 'They should be on their game. If we have to go through this massive process -- we have to take off our shoes and  go through the possibility of being strip-searched the least they can do is to do their jobs if we're going to go through all of that,' said one angry flier.

"An Al Qaeda bomber sent to blow up a U.S.-bound airliner was actually a double agent who infiltrated the group and volunteered for the suicide mission, it has been revealed. Saudi Arabia's intelligence agency placed the undercover operator inside Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) where he convinced his handlers to give him the new type of non-metallic bomb. The agent, who was in Yemen, was liaising with the CIA before handing the device over to intelligence services. Plotter? Senior Al Qaeda leader Fahd Al-Quso, killed on Sunday by a drone strike, was believed to be behind the updated underpants bomb plot . AQAP have been identified as the most dangerous and determined branch of the terror network. The explosive device was supposed to be smuggled aboard an aircraft undetected and then detonated. The revelation, first reported by The Los Angeles Times, shows how the CIA was able to get its hands on a sophisticated underwear bomb well before an attack was set in motion. The agent arrived safely in an unidentified country and is being debriefed. New terror alert: The feds say Al-Qaeda planned to strike on the first anniversary of Osama bin Laden's death . Experts at the FBI's bomb laboratory in Quantico, Virginia, are now analysing the device to see if it could have evaded airport security. It did not contain metal, meaning it probably could have passed through an airport metal detector. But it is not clear whether new body scanners used in many airports would have detected it. If such a device could be smuggled through, it could in theory be detonated before passengers or crew knew it was on board. It appeared to be an upgraded version of . the so-called 'underwear bomb' that failed to down a passenger jet over . Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. A bombing was to be carried out, reports suggest, to mark the first anniversary of the killing of Osama Bin Laden. 'Like that bomb, this device bears the forensic signature of feared Al Qaeda bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri,' who is believed to be hiding in Yemen, the LA Times website reported. The operation relied not on the high-tech and satellite surveillance for which the CIA has been known in recent years, but old-fashioned human intelligence work. It did, however, produce intelligence that helped the CIA locate top Al Qaeda operative Fahd al-Qasaa, who was killed on Sunday when a CIA drone targeted him with a missile as he stepped out of his car in Yemen. Two counter-terrorism officials told the New York Daily News they believed 37-year-old al-Quso, who had a $5million bounty on his head, was the key militant behind the plans. Al-Quso was indicted in the U.S. for his role in the 2000 bombing of the USS Cole in the harbour of Aden, Yemen, in which 17 American sailors were killed and 39 injured. Bomber shorts: Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab wore this underwear outfitted with explosives for three weeks before the failed bomb attempt on Christmas Day 2009 . Terror strike: Abdulmutallab, pictured in his 2009 mugshot, was sentenced to three life terms after pleading guilty . He was later believed to have replaced . Anwar al-Awlaki as the Al Qaeda on the Arabian Peninsula's head of . external operations when the latter was killed in a U.S. airstrike last . year. Senator . Dianne Feinstein, of California, who heads the Senate Intelligence . Committee, said yesterday she had been briefed about an 'undetectable' device that was 'going to be on a U.S.-bound airliner.' There were no immediate plans to change security procedures at U.S. airports. However, there are claims that extra air marshals have been deployed across Europe to protect U.S.-bound jets. Flights out of Gatwick Airport, in England, reportedly received 100 percent coverage. The 'would-be suicide bomber', based in Yemen and believed to be working for al-Quso, had not been given a target plane or bought his tickets when the CIA seized the bomb. White House spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden said President Obama learned about the plot in April. All passengers on U.S.-bound flights are checked against terrorist watch lists and law enforcement databases. In . some countries, U.S. officials are stationed in airports to offer . advice on security matters. In some cases, though, the U.S. is limited . to hoping that other countries follow the security advice from the . Transportation Security Administration. The Christmas 2009 bombing . originated in Amsterdam, where the bomber did not receive a full-body . scan. And in 2010, terrorists smuggled bombs onto cargo jets, which . receive less scrutiny than passenger planes. In . both those instances, the bombs were made by Al Qaeda's master bomb . maker in Yemen, Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri. Officials believe this latest . bomb was the handiwork of al-Asiri or one of his students. Armed sky marshals were introduced on British airliners in 2003 in response to fears of a 9/11-style terror attack launched from airports in the UK. Then Home Secretary David Blunkett said the move, which was confined to transatlantic routes, was a ‘proportionate and appropriate response’ to the terror threat against this country. At the time, reports indicated that plain-clothes officers would carry guns firing low-velocity bullets, to prevent one going through the target and piercing the shell of the plane. In all likelihood they would be seated near the cockpit, in first or business class. Passengers are never notified if an air marshal is on their plane, although pilots are told. Neither the airline industry, police nor Government officials will comment publicly on the policy, and since its introduction it has largely been shrouded in secrecy. Other countries are more open about their use of sky marshals. The Israeli national airline, El Al, has had an armed marshal on every flight for more than a decade. And air marshals have been used in the US for more than 30 years. Notified: The White House said President Obama was told about the terror plot back in April, despite his administration's claim over the last few weeks that there was no 'credible threat' To anti-terror investigators, there was little that marked out Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab as a potential Al Qaeda recruit and suicide bomber. As the son of one of Nigeria’s most prominent businessmen, the 25-year-old former British university student lived a privileged life with access to large funds, homes in three countries and international travel. During his time studying mechanical engineering at University College London, he was described as a ‘quiet, caring, diligent student’. Investigators admit he ‘simply did not fit their profile’ of a potential terrorist. Yet on Christmas Day 2009, Abdulmutallab came close to blowing up a packed transatlantic flight with explosives sewn into his underwear. He flew from Lagos to Amsterdam, then boarded Northwest Airlines Flight 253 to Detroit, which was carrying 279 passengers and 11 crew. Hours into the flight, he tried to detonate the explosives by injecting chemicals into them. He suffered severe burns when the bomb failed to explode, and was overpowered by passengers and crew. Disturbingly, the bomb was not picked up in airport security checks in Lagos and Amsterdam. Now serving a life prison sentence in the United States, Abdulmutallab is certain to be questioned again about his bomb, its maker and those who supplied it. In London, he was president of the university’s Islamic Society and ‘crossed the radar screen’ of MI5, the UK’s domestic counter-intelligence and security agency, for radical links and communications with Islamic extremists. But investigators say that Al Qaeda operatives identified Abdulmutallab  only as ‘vulnerable’ and did not target him until after he began studying Arabic in the Yemeni capital San’aa in August 2009. Suspect: Authorities believe the updated underwear bomb was the work of master bomb maker Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri . Al-Qaeda's most feared bomb maker is believed to be behind the foiled plot to bring down a U.S.-bound airliner. Ibrahim Hassan al-Asiri was responsible for the so-called underpants bomb which was supposed to blow up on Christmas Day in 2009. Experts said the new device handed over to the CIA by the double agent who was operating in Yemen bears the same forensic signature. U.S. authorities believe the weapon was either made by Al-Asiri or one of his students and they described it as an upgraded version of the bomb used in the 2009 plot. Al-Asiri, 30, is believed to be hiding in Yemen where he arrived in 2006 after being jailed by Saudi officials in crackdowns against Islamic militants. The twist this time was an absence of metal, which could have made the device undetectable by conventional airport scanners. 'It was a threat from a standpoint of the design,' said John Brennan, President Barack Obama's counterterrorism adviser. His younger brother, Abdullah, also made the trek to Yemen as they turned their backs on their father, a four-decade veteran of the Saudi military. In Yemen's rugged northern mountains, they met with fugitive Yemeni militant Nasser al-Wahishi, a former aide to Osama Bin Laden, and became the nucleus of the new Al Qaiea affiliate, said the magazine account, which could not be independently confirmed. They later brought in U.S.-born cleric Anwar al-Awlaki as a powerful propaganda voice in the West. Al-Awlaki was killed in a U.S. airstrike last September. U.S. intelligence officials at first believed al-Asiri also was killed in the attack, but their suspicions were proven wrong several weeks later. After the failed Christmas 2009 bombing, investigators pulled al-Asiri's fingerprint off the bomb hidden in the underwear of the Nigerian-born suspect, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, aboard the Northwest Airlines flight. Less than a year later, al-Asiri was linked to the discovery of printer cartridges packed with PETN and sent by international courier with Chicago-area synagogues listed as the destination. The explosive-rigged packages - believed powerful enough to bring down a plane - were pulled off airplanes in England and the United Arab Emirates. Al-Asiri became a major focus of America's anti-terrorism efforts. In March 2011, Washington officially designed al-Asiri as a wanted terrorist, calling him the primary bombmaker for AQAP. It also presumably puts al-Asiri among the chief targets on the U.S. hit list. Since . the terror attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001, Al Qaeda has . put different types of plans into action in numerous Jihad plots. While . none of the plots have been successful, they have brought change to . airport screenings and other security measures.","Scores of air marshals were posted to Europe last week to protect U.S.-bound .

"They may have only been married for a matter of days, but it was straight back to work for Imran Khan and new bride Reham Khan today. The newlyweds shared their walima - wedding banquet - with under-privileged children whose lives have been blighted by war, and young religious students. Mr and Mrs Khan distributed food at welfare organisation Sweet Homes in Islamabad, Pakistan, on Friday. It is a project of Pakistan Bait-ul-Maal which provides shelter, education and care to young people from Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) such as Dera Bugti, Kashmir and Bannu, whose lives have been affected by conflict. New bride Reham Khan arrives at the Sweet Homes shelter for children for lunch wearing a purple, pink and red abaya . Imran Khan drives his new wife Reham  to a children's charity to share lunch with children who have been affected by war . The couple also drove to a seminary run by Mufti Saeed to serve food to and dine with young seminary (religious) students of Madarsa. Former BBC weather girl Mrs Khan, who married the cricketer-turned-politician at a low-key ceremony at his home in Islamabad last week, was seen smiling as her new husband drove the couple in a four-by-four vehicle. Divorced mother-of-three Mrs Khan, who was wearing a colourful purple, pink and red abaya with a matching veil, and her new husband stayed and shared the rice and chicken lunch with the children and staff at the seminary. The couple sat opposite each other on the floor and posed for photos with the children. Mr Khan, 62, revealed it was not the couple's intention to get married so soon - but he felt under pressure to bring forward the date. He said: 'Getting married was not my plan right now, I thought I would do it after the 20th. 'But because of the kind of stories that were spreading and ill-informed news about Reham Khan, I decided to get married sooner. So, I spoke to my children and got married.'

Young boys whose lives have been blighted by war pictured at the shelter for under-privileged children in Islamabad today . Mr Khan, who has two children from his previous marriage to socialite Jemima Khan, said he wanted Pakistan to start a new tradition of donating to the underprivileged instead of spending huge amounts of money on lavish weddings. It comes after a spokesman for the couple said their wedding was kept small to honour the 145 victims of the terrorist attack on a school in Peshawar last month, in which 132 children died. The couple married after weeks of speculation - but not a single member of his family was invited to the event. A close friend of Mr Khan - who is the Chairman of Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (Pakistan Movement for Justice) - said the ceremony had taken place at his home in Islamabad in accordance with Islamic law. Mr Khan's sisters did not attend the 'nikkah' - Islamic marriage ceremony - amid reports they do not approve of the match. Aleema Khan said: 'We were neither aware nor informed of the nikkah prior to this.' However the bride's mother, sister and two close friends were all present for the intimate ceremony, according to her nephew Yusuf Khan. Scroll down for video . Finally: Imran Khan married his fiance, Reham, at an intimate wedding ceremony in Islamabad last week . Intimate: Close friends and family attended the ceremony but it's thought that Imran Khan's sisters did not . He said: 'I am very close to her, she is like my mother. We have decided to hold a small reception tomorrow. There were only a few close friends of Imran Khan present at the occasion. 'The majority of our family lives in UK and USA and that is the reason only my mother, grandmother and I attended it from close family.' Spokesman Naeemul Haq said:  'We did not want to celebrate it in big way due to the Peshawar school massacre. 'They look very elegant together. It is the biggest news of the new year for the people of Pakistan. Tomorrow both bride and groom will distribute food among the poor and needy.' Imran Khan's sister, Aleema, confirmed that none of his family were present and said they were never asked to attend. The match has caused huge controversy in Pakistan where Mr Khan is chairman of the opposition party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf. Mrs Khan said: 'We, all the sisters, were never informed or contacted by Imran so there was no question to attend it. All of us are in Lahore.' Zakir Khan, a close friend of Mr Khan's who witnessed the marriage, confirmed the dowry, a ceremonial fee paid for the bride, was 82,000 rupees - around £850. Formalities: A close friend of Imran Khan's confirmed that a dowry of 82,000 rupees - around £850 - was agreed for the bride . Mr Khan's wedding may also have doubled as a fundraiser for a new cancer Hospital, which is currently under construction in Peshawar, according to reports. Khan tweeted: 'I want to thank everyone for their good wishes on my marriage & would ask those wanting to send a gift to donate to SKMTH Peshawar [Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital and Research Centre, in Peshawar] instead.' His party's spokesperson, Shireen Mazari, rubbished reports that only those who agreed to donate money for the hospital would be invited to the reception. The formal announcement comes after a turbulent week for the couple, who have incited the wrath of Mr Khan's family and the wider public in Pakistan. A friend of Mrs Khan, 41, told how she was suffering emotional turmoil after being trolled over her marriage to the Pakistani cricketer-turned-politician. Some social media users have accused the divorced mother-of-three of being a lesbian and one image even claims to show her in a sex shop. A producer at Dawn TV told MailOnline that the backlash had left the broadcaster 'very disturbed'. The source said: 'She is not in the right state of mind after seeing the reaction of trolls on social media after news of her marriage with Imran Khan was disclosed. 'She has not been conducting her daily programme as well. She is very disturbed by the way she is being portrayed on social media.' It came as Mr Khan spoke out against the storm surrounding his  wedding, telling his critics that marriage is not a crime. His sister Aleena reacted with anger at the news, saying she doesn't want to meet the new Mrs Khan. Mrs Khan, a divorced mother-of-three, was a BBC weather girl but is now a news anchor of AAJ TV . Told by MailOnline that her brother had revealed he was actually married, Aleema Khan - who claimed the rumours were started by opposition politicians looking to discredit her brother - said: 'Really? Really? Let's see if he announces it officially. I am taken aback. 'This is a real challenge for him. We haven't met her and I don't know that we want to meet her. 'It is his decision, he is a grown up. It is more important how the children feel. 'I suppose in any situation like this the children will not feel good about it. They do look up to their father.' Speaking amid a political storm surrounding rumours of the marriage, she said she hoped Reham Khan 'will be good for Pakistan and our brother'. She added: 'It all depends on how the public respond to it. The biggest surprise is how everybody in Pakistan feels they have a right to participate in the decision. 'He is a grown man, we are watching the situation unfold.' But speaking from his home in Islamabad yesterday, Mr Khan launched a robust defence of his actions and of his new bride, declaring: 'A person can marry whenever he/she wants.' He pointed to the fact that he had in no way deceived his wife and insisted that he put his two teenage children first when coming to a decision. The 62-year-old said: 'I didn't think of my marriage for 10 years after my divorce because my children were small. I do not ever think of hurting my children's feelings.' Khan's ex-wife Jemima Goldsmith has been among those to offer her congratulations to the former cricketer. She tweeted: 'I hope Imran will be happy in this new phase of his life.' Ms Goldsmith, who divorced Khan in 2004 after nine years of marriage and has two teenage sons with him, also spoke of her fondness for Pakistan. Ms Goldsmith revealed in October that she was ditching the surname 'Khan' and reverting to her family name because her ex-husband was about to remarry. She said at the time: 'My ex-husband, Imran, recently announced that he intended to get remarried soon, which made me think it's probably time to change my name back to Goldsmith.' Khan married Ms Goldsmith in a traditional Islamic ceremony in Paris in 1995. What Mrs Khan's former in-laws think of the marriage is less clear. Reham, who was born in Libya to Pakistani parents, has three children from her previous marriage to a doctor. Fazlur Rehman, her ex-father-in-law, a retired major in the Pakistan army, refused to speak to reporters when they approached him. Reham Khan is understood to have moved into the house with her youngest daughter, according to her former colleague and friend. The Daily Mail's diarist Sebastian Shakespeare broke the news of Khan's marriage to the broadcaster last week. On New Year's Eve, Mr Khan said rumours of marriage were 'greatly exaggerated' and his sister Aleema said the family challenged him 'a few days ago' over the news and he denied it. But speaking to reporters at Heathrow airport on Tuesday, before boarding a flight to Pakistan, Khan is reported to have said: 'I am going to Pakistan to share good news about my marriage with the nation. I have nothing to hide.'","Pakistani politician married former BBC weather girl at intimate ceremony at his home last week .

"There may not be much cause for cheer at Ibrox of late, but at least Kenny McDowall can celebrate achieving a feat which eluded his predecessor this term. Three times Ally McCoist failed to beat lowly Alloa — the third a humbling 3-2 reversal in the Petrofac Training Cup semi-final. That capitulation from 2-0 up with 13 minutes to play sparked the beginning of the end for McCoist, but McDowall’s men went some way to making amends by grinding out a scrappy, 1-0 win, courtesy of Nicky Law’s first-half strike.

Goals: Law 15' Referee: Greg Aitken . Attendance: 3,012 . It says a great deal, however, that such a result can be taken as progress. Before plummeting into financial turmoil, Rangers were on the brink of achieving four successive top-flight titles. In Clackmannanshire on Saturday, they only narrowly avoided a rather more ignominious four in a row. The visitors were second-best for large stretches of this open contest, which came at the end of another eventful week for the club. Sandy Easdale took up his seat at the Indodrill Stadium amid growing concerns for his powerbase at Ibrox. Last week, takeover bids were tabled by American financier Robert Sarver, while the Three Bears — Douglas Park, George Taylor and George Letham — snapped up shares as they sought regime change. Footballing matters were also a source of speculation with Ian Cathro and Felix Magath linked with coaching positions. It almost seemed fitting, then, that the latest tumultuous spell should culminate in a clash with their bogey team. Just six who started in the Alloa defeat did so here — Kyle Hutton making only his second start of the season — but that December night seemed to play on the visitors’ minds in the opening exchanges. Unsurprisingly, Alloa started the game without fear. In the opening minutes, Stephen Simmons even added a touch of samba flair to the chilly surroundings, beating Nicky Law with a cheeky backheel. And the hosts almost snatched an early lead when Liam Buchanan chipped Steve Simonsen — the ball dropping inches wide of the far post. It took Rangers 15 minutes to get the monkey off their backs. Jon Daly was given space in the area to fizz a low ball across the six-yard box which Law gleefully turned in. Rangers' Jon Daly shields the ball away from Alloa's Ben Gordon . Rangers goalkeeper Steve Simonsen makes a fingertip save to keep the ball out . Yet Alloa dug in and frustrated their opponents. Simmons and Ryan McCord proved a handful for Kyle Hutton in the middle of the park, giving the 23-year-old little time on the ball. But, with the snow billowing, Rangers should have doubled their lead. Kenny Miller raced clear of the Alloa defence but crashed his shot against the inside of the post. The hosts were equally capable of threatening, though, and left-winger Kevin Cawley saw his curling right-footed effort deflected high and wide. As Rangers burst forwards, Daly found David Templeton in space on the right of the box but the winger’s low shot found the legs of Craig McDowall. Templeton then turned provider, picking an excellent through pass to split the Wasps’ defence to find Miller. McDowall once again blocked with his legs to deny the veteran frontman. Rangers pushed in search of a second and Miller almost grabbed it in style. Richard Foster, afforded too much space down the right flank, pumped in a cross which Miller met with a cute, backheeled volley which was saved. At the back, Rangers looked suspect and Alloa sensed an equaliser. As the visitors struggled to clear their lines, Simmons hit a feeble shot from the edge of the box presented at Simonsen. Alloa could count themselves unlucky to be behind at the break after Mark Docherty whipped a dangerous free-kick which narrowly missed the head of team-mate Ben Gordon. Rangers were calmer when play restarted, content to dominate possession and keep their slender advantage. McDowall was eventually called into action on the hour when he fumbled Daly’s 30-yard piledriver. Simonsen was kept busy soon afterwards, though, as Cawley slid in to beat Darren McGregor and direct a bobbling effort at the stopper. Wasps boss Smith rolled the dice midway through the half by adding an extra striker in Spence, Rangers’ tormentor-in-chief here last month. Rangers responded by throwing on Kris Boyd and Fraser Aird and the latter injected a turn of pace his side were desperately lacking. The winger unleashed a powerful right-footed shot which McDowall parried. Spence — unbeaten in his career against Rangers — almost embarrassed the Ibrox men once more, but Simonsen reacted superbly to save his thunderous 30-yard free-kick at the death. .","Nicky Law scores 14th-minute winner for Rangers against Alloa .

"Keith Curle left Carlisle United supporters in no doubt about the relationship breakdown between the club and wantaway midfielder Alex Marrow. Manager Curle didn't mince his words in branding the player a 'sick-note' and revealed that he's asked Marrow to leave Brunton Park without Carlisle paying up the remainder of his one-year contract. But Curle asserts that while the 24-year-old wants to depart, he is sitting on his contract and wants a pay-off. Carlisle United manager Keith Curle didn't hold back when talking about wantaway midfielder Alex Marrow . Marrow (right) wants to leave the club and has made just four appearances for Carlisle this season . Carlisle United currently sit just above the League Two relegation zone in 22nd position, having won seven and drawn three of their 24 league games this season. The Cumbrians were knocked out in the first round of both the FA Cup and the Capital One Cup. Carlisle reached the second round of the Johnstone's Paint Trophy and were beaten on penalties by Tranmere. Marrow returned to the League Two strugglers this week after being absent for a month with illness. 'Alex Marrow is back with us after his sick note period expired,' Curle said. 'The situation with him is that Alex wants to leave the football club. I also want Alex to leave the football club. 'We're going through a process of finding the best way for him to leave the club which is financially beneficial to both parties. 'Fortunately for Alex, while he is here, and doesn't want to be here, he still gets paid. Unfortunately for me while Alex is here, and doesn't want to be here, I've still got to pay him. 'I've asked Alex to leave and not take the money he's owed. That has been my negotiating strategy. We've obviously hit a stumbling block on that. Curle gives instructions to his players during a match against Northampton Town last month . 'In the short term, the beauty of what we've got with working for a very honourable football club is that we will continue to pay Alex for his services, even though he doesn't want to be here.' Marrow has only played four league games since a free transfer from Blackburn Rovers in the summer. Meanwhile, winger Danny Kearns - who has been absent from the club to 'refocus his mind' - was also the subject of some straight talking from Curle. 'I didn't ask him to go away,' Curle added.

"They're known as the wisest animals in the kingdom, with their nocturnal hoots heard far and wide. But for one breed of owl, quick-wits are just as important when lamenting one's place in the wild. Tucked away in the creek of a tree, the Eastern screen owl can hardly be seen from a distance, its spotted feathers blending in perfectly to the wood and bark encasing it. The owl's camouflaging techniques have evolved over time in order to protect its home and catch prey, with adults standing guard as tiny owlets hide behind them. In a stunning set of images captured by British photographer Graham McGeorge, one litter of young huddle together as their parents hunt for prey. The 43-year-old from Dumfries watched the family from 20-feet away on a trip to Florida, after journeying to the U.S. to catch a glimpse of the elusive birds. One of the images, titled Master of Disguise: The Next Generation, was listed in 2013 for a National Geographic photography competition. Though famed for its mastery of the art of camouflage, the screech owl is known for its low-pitched hoots and howls which give it its name.

"A customer was refused a wet wipe in a halal-only branch of KFC because they are soaked in alcohol and might offend Muslim diners. Graham Noakes was visiting a branch of the fast food chain in St George's Retail Oark, Leicester, when he asked to use a wet wipe. But staff said they did not stock wipes because they are soaked in alcohol, which is banned in Islam. Graham Noakes, 41, left, was refused a wet wipe in a KFC halal-only branch in Leicester, pictured right . A spokesman for KFC has since said that the incident was a misunderstanding and that alcohol-based wet wipes are not banned by the company. Mr Noakes said: 'They told me it might offend other customers. I explained that it wouldn't affect me. 'In fact - I told them I like alcohol, so it wouldn't bother me in the slightest. When they wouldn't give me one, I was disgusted. I will never be going to KFC again.' The 41-year-old added: 'I've never experienced anything like this before, I couldn't believe what I was hearing. 'Why shouldn't I be allowed a wipe for my hands? They use wipes in hospital, what happens when we start being told we can't have wipes there? I just can't understand it.' The father-of-two, who lives in Birmingham, was working in Leicester on the construction of a new Muslim community centre when the incident took place. The branch, in St George's Retail Parkm said it could not give out wet wipes because they contain alcohol and might offend Muslim customers . A KFC spokesman said the company had been running a halal-only trial since 2010 in areas where there has been demand from customers. He added that, in those stores, some products from the usual menu are not available. He said this particular restaurant removed its wet wipes because it was uncertain on company policy. Most wet wipes are alcohol-based. A KFC spokesman said the incident was a misunderstanding . The spokesman said the branch has now been informed that is is allowed to stock alcohol-based wet wipes and has already brought some into the store. He said: 'Our alcohol-based hand wipes are approved for use in all our restaurants, including those who are part of the halal trial. 'There was a misunderstanding at the store in question, but the wipes are now being used again. We’re sorry for the customer’s experience.' Suleman Nagdi, spokesman for the Leicester-based Federation of Muslim Organisations, said: 'I know alcohol is prohibited in the Muslim community, but I don't understand why you can't use hand-wipes - there's nothing wrong with it. 'Using alcohol doesn't mean you're consuming it. It seems like an unusual decision to be made. In fact, it sounds bizarre.' Suleman said such decisions potentially provoked some people to start 'lashing out' at the Muslim community. 'I've never come across anything like this before. KFC have made a commercial decision to do this, and now the Muslim community will face backlash.' In Arabic the word Halal means ‘permitted’ or ‘lawful’ and defines anything that is allowed or lawful according to the Koran. It is often used to indicate food – particularly meat – that has been prepared in accordance with Muslim principles and techniques. In Britain, killing an animal without prior stunning is illegal, but the law gives special exemption to Muslim and Jewish meat producers on the grounds of religion.","Graham Noakes, 41, visited chain in St George's retail park, Leicester .

"Health food giant Holland & Barrett has been attacked by race equality charities for selling a £9.99 cream which claims to make skin whiter. The Royal Jelly Skin Body Whitening Cream  is stocked in a number of the retailer's 620 British stores and is listed on its website. The label insists it is for sun damage, spots and freckles - but its sale was criticised by campaigners, who claimed it was a throwback to ideas about lighter skin signifying higher social class. Controversial: Holland & Barrett is under fire for selling a £9.99 skin whitening cream (pictured) Jabeer Bhutt, the deputy chief executive of the Race Equality Foundation, has asked Holland & Barrett to remove the cream from its shelves to set an example. 'In 1930s America, if your skin was lighter than a brown bag you could go through the front door and if it wasn't you had to go round the back,' he said. 'We have moved on since then. 'It's a shock to us that anybody, particularly Holland & Barrett, would make anything like this available. 'Although I can't speak for this particular product, many of these creams have very questionable properties. 'But our worry here is a more wide-ranging one about what it means to be beautiful and what it means not to be beautiful. 'Consumers should be able to decide for themselves, but my worry is that this is part of a much bigger issue that's been impacting particularly on children and young people. 'In Bollywood films for example there is a very active debate about actresses having to lighten their skin to appear on screen.' Description: The packaging insisted the cream can be used for age, liver and sun spots as well as blemishes and scars - but campaigners claimed such creams are designed with ethnic minority customers in mind . Debbie Weekes-Bernard, of the Runnymede Trust equality think-tank, told The Independent the firm 'clearly knows its target demographic and why they'll buy it'. She added it was an 'insult to generations of work done to encourage darker-skinned people to have pride in their skin'. The cream on sale is made by Dr Organic, a Swansea-based firm which sells an array of natural products including coconut oil and snail gel. It does not include controversial bleaching chemicals or steroids which have caused other whitening creams to make headlines. Instead it uses an extract from the common brown algae ascophyllum nodosum, which it says reduces production of the skin pigment melanin. The product's packaging insists it can be used on age, liver and sun spots, freckles, scars, blemishes, discoloured skin patches and darkened elbows and knees alongside 'general skin brightening' - a sentiment which was echoed by a Holland & Barrett spokesman to the Independent. Commonplace: Skin whitening creams with names such as 'white babyface' shown on sale in Bangkok, Thailand, in 2006. Millions of people use them around the world but their existence is controversial to some . The campaigners, however, claim that despite not being harmful to skin it projects the wrong messages about beauty. One customer using the Dr Organic cream wrote online: 'I've used this product for three months, once or twice a day, and my entire family has seen effective results. 'I've gone a couple shades lighter... It's organic so you know its actually doing something, unlike other products which just bleach you. 'This is my second bottle, I got my entire family using it because it doesn't just make you lighter, it gives you this nice glow.' A spokesman for Holland and Barrett said: 'Dr. Organic Skin Whitening Cream was developed due to a demand for a product which helps to lighten age spots, freckles and hyperpigmented skin on the face and body. 'The core ingredient is a natural extract called Ascophyllum nodosum which is a brown algae. It has proven skin whitening attributes especially for use on age spots, liver spots, freckles, sun damaged skin, scars blemishes, dark elbows and knees as well as general skin brightening. 'The rest of the formula helps to condition, protect and moisturise the skin. We do not use harsh bleaching agents.' The row surrounding skin-whitening techniques dates back several decades. Campaigners say their very existence is a nod to underlying racism in society, implying that lighter skin makes people more beautiful. Some unregulated creams have also contained bleaching chemicals such as hydroquinone, which some studies say have caused severe skin damage and unsightly blotches. Three traders in Brixton, south London, were fined £51,000 in 2007 for selling illegal skin lightening creams which contained harmful steroids. Despite the controversies, whitening creams are still used by millions of people from Britain to South Africa, Nigeria, India and Thailand.","Holland & Barrett stocks 'royal jelly' cream by Swansea firm Dr Organic .

"Demcoratic Senate Majority Leader . Harry Reid made waves on Thursday by predicting that his GOP . counterpart, House Speaker John Boehner, will ultimately 'cave in' and . green-light a comprehensive immigration reform bill. But . Republicans' frustrations ignore the fact that most U.S. Hispanics . prefer their approach to the thorny subject over the Democrats' central . idea. Reid, a Nevadan, told the Las Vegas Sun that Boehner is 'going to cave in' eventually because of outside pressure from Hispanic activists. 'I think there’s going to be so much pressure on the House that they’ll have to pass it,' he said. 'If . the Republicans ever want to elect a Republican president again, . they’re going to have to get right with the Hispanic and Asian community . who, by more than 70 percent, voted for Obama last time.' Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, a Nevada Democrat, claimed House Republicans 'will cave in' and embrace his party's approach to an amnesty for 11 million illegal immigrants . President Barack Obama met on Nov. 29 with immigration reform activists who are fasting in protest. The president's coattails on the issue have shrunk, with 60 per cent of Americans now disapproving of how he handles the immigration fight . The questions: How will Hispanics like these men in a Los Angeles County Latino district vote, and will a GOP walk-back on immigration change their minds? The Reid-led Senate . passed a bill in June that includes most of President Barack Obama's . immigration wish list, most notably a pathway to citizenship for people . who live in the United States illegally. The . effort has stalled in the House of Representatives, with . Republican leaders insisting that America's 11 million illegal . immigrants must not be given new legal protections until the U.S. border . with Mexico is largely sealed. Some . Republican lawmakers have proposed a '90 per cent' test, agreeing that a . pathway to legal status could be extended only after the U.S. is capable of . blocking nine out of every ten people who try to make an illicit border crossing. That approach seems to resonate with Hispanic voters. Does it matter? In a Pew poll, only the national . economy drove more dislike of Obama's policies than immigration, a . political reality that could put Speaker John Boehner (L) in the . driver's seat . Passion: Immigration activists placed 477 crosses Wednesday on the National Mall -- one for each 2012 death of someone illegally attempting to enter the U.S. on its southwest border . Write caption here . In a June 2013 . poll, the most recent published survey on the subject, 60 per cent of . registered Hispanic voters said they supported granting illegal . immigrants a new status 'only when the 90% goal is reached.' Just 34 per cent disagreed. Not a big deal? In the 2012 Pew Hispanic Center poll, immigration placed nearly last among issues U.S. Hispanics said were 'extremely important' to them . The survey was . conducted by the Latino Opinions organization and sponsored by Jordan . Winery. It asked respondents if they thought illegal immigrants should . be permitted to collect benefits from the federal government, including . health insurance subsidies, 'while they are going through the legalization process and before the 90% goal is reached.' They opposed the idea by a 56-40 margin. The . poll also found that while Hispanics in general rank immigration reform . among the issues that concern them most, those who are registered to . vote consider it less important than the economy, education, or health . care. A June 2012 Gallup survey . found much the same. Twenty per cent of Hispanics told Gallup's . pollsters that immigration was their most important issue – tying it for . the lead with two other issues – but Just 12 per cent of Hispanic . registered voters said the same. That number put immigration near the . bottom of the pack. Those . finding may give Republican hard-liners some solace. Centrists have . argued that the GOP needs to embrace a liberal-leaning immigration . stance in order to entice Hispanic voters away from Democrats' waiting . arms. 'It puts us on a . playing field where we can compete for the Hispanic voter,' Arizona Sen. John McCain told PBS host Gwen Ifill in July. 'If . we don’t do that,' he said, 'frankly ... I see further . polarization of the Hispanic voters and the demographics are clear that . the Republican Party cannot win a national election. That’s just a . fact.' They speak Spanish, they vote, and they support Democrats: So what's the GOP to do? Some Republicans believe 'caving' on immigration will be the first step toward rapprochement with U.S. Hispanics . But a 2012 Pew Hispanic . Center poll showed that few in that demographic group – only 34 per . cent – said immigration policy is an 'extremely important issue.' Fully . 55 per cent said education was extremely important to them, closely . followed by 'jobs and the economy' with 54 per cent, health care with 50 . per cent, and the federal budget deficit with 36 per cent. GOP's complication: Many immigration activists are organized by the Service Employees International Union or other labor groups, making an easy ideological bridge to the Democratic Party . Only the issue of tax reform, rated . as extremely important by just 33 per cent of Hispanics, polled lower than . immigration – and by just a single percentage point. Still, . the Pew survey found that a paltry 22 per cent of Hispanics self-identify . as Republicans, a reality that some in the GOP believe they can turn . around by conceding the immigration issue to Democrats. Speaker Boehner's office announced Tuesday that it has hired Rebecca Tallent as his new point person on immigration policy. Tallent . caught flak from conservatives when she was Sen. McCain's chief adviser . on the same issue. She played a role in drafting a failed comprehensive immigration reform bill in 2007. More recent polls find Hispanic Americans splitting with President Obama in record numbers. Gallup reported . Thursday that Obama has lost 23 percentage point of support from that . group since  the month after his 2012 re-election. Now 52 per cent of . Hispanics approve of his job performance, down from 75 per cent a year . ago. And Pew found last . month that 60 per cent of Americans disapprove of how the president is . handling the immigration issue, a number that had never before broken the 50 . per cent threshold.","Senate .

Australian cricket officials are still no closer to knowing whether Clarke will be fit enough to play in next year's World Cup.

'His recovery and the timing of his return to play will be dependent on the surgeon's advice and how well he recovers in the coming weeks.'

Smith is the third youngest player in the squad to play at the Gabba and will be Australia's youngest captain since Kim Hughes in the 1970s, but he promised not to let the added responsibilities change the way he approaches the game.

"Dozens of Chinese mothers are giving birth to their babies in a house atop a hill in a wealthy neighborhood of Chino Hills, California - and they're paying thousands of dollars for the privilege. Neighbors say the home is a 'maternity mansion,' a hotel where Chinese women stay for the last few months of their pregnancy so their children are born on American soil - and are therefore American citizens. Experts say the practice is widespread and that authorities are nearly powerless to stop it. The 14th Amendment guarantees that any person born in the United States is an American citizen and is afforded all the rights granted by the Constitution. Maternity mansion: Neighbors say this seven bedroom home is used as a make-shift hospital for Chinese mothers who want to give birth to babies in America . Cheat sheet: The house is owned by a man who runs AsiamChild.com, a site that sells space for Chinese mothers to give birth to their babies on American soil . 'I do believe they are taking advantage of a loophole that has been found. Because what I understand after doing my research and homework is that it is an epidemic and it's nationwide,' Rossana Mitchell, a Chino Hills resident who is trying to shut down the 'maternity mansion' in her neighborhood, told KABC-TV. The Chino Hills home is owned by Hai Yong Wu, a Chinese national who operates the website AsiamChild.com. The website says that for $5,000 to $15,000, Chinese women can stay for the remainder of their pregnancies in the seven-bedroom home and give birth to their child on U.S. soil. The Chinese-language site also includes tips on how expectant mothers can hide their pregnancies from U.S. customs officials. The site suggests women wear black and put a backpack or a bag in front of their bulging stomachs. Offer: The website explains to parents how to take advantage of welfare services in the U.S. Creepy: Locals are hoping to shut down the exploitative service based in southern California . It also lists the benefits of being a U.S. citizen, including the social safety net, free education and a path for citizenship for the parents when the child turns 21. 'They're selling U.S. citizenship. They're putting a price on it and they're bringing people over here specifically for that reason,' Sandy Hayden, another Chino Hills resident, told KABC. The city of Chino Hills has issued the owner a cease and desist order - though the only recourse is charging a zoning violation for operating a hotel in a residential area. Otherwise, the practice appears to be entirely legal. The concept of 'anchor babies' briefly became an issue during discussions of illegal immigration.

Scroll down for video . Exposed: Illegal immigrants from Central America, Nepal and Bangladesh are seen in a truck trailer after being detected by police X-ray equipment at a checkpoint in La Pochota outside Tuxtla Gutierrez, capital of Mexico's Chiapas State . Authorities said the migrants were traveling in inhumane conditions. The driver of the vehicle, who was from central Mexico, was arrested on human trafficking charges.The truck set out from Huehuetenango, Guatemala, and police detected the migrants with an X-ray at a checkpoint outside Tuxtla Gutierrez after midnight on Monday. The migrants were on their way to the United States, state prosecutors said. Several of the migrants were treated for hand and leg injuries, and some struggled to breathe due to the 'overcrowded conditions' on the truck, Mexico's National Migration Institute said. 'It's a long journey and they intended to travel to the United States like that, literally hidden,' said Hector Flores, a spokesman for the Chiapas state prosecutor's office. 'Obviously, those are not optimal conditions for human beings.' Recurring problem: Here, a police officer walks past migrants from India outside the Attorney General's building near Tuxtla Gutierrez  in Chiapas in 2011 . The non-Asian migrants were from the Central American nations of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. The entire group, which included seven minors, is likely to face deportation proceedings. Between 2007 and 2011, the most recent year for which statistics were available, the number of Indian nationals apprehended by U.S. authorities jumped from less than 1,000 annually to nearly 4,000. The numbers of Bangladeshi, Nepalese and Sri Lankan migrants detained have also increased.The Central Americans were charged between $4,000 and $5,000 for the journey, while the Asian migrants had to pay between $6,000 and $8,000, according to the National Migration Institute.An Indian national was among a group of 165 migrants rescued by Mexican troops in June, after being kidnapped near the U.S. border and held in the state of Tamaulipas.","A truck packed with 94 illegal migrants was detained in Chiapas, Mexico, as it headed for the U.S. border .

"A gang of eight Republican and Democratic senators has hammered out an immigration reform deal that could allow 11million illegal immigrants to gain legal status and, eventually, American citizenship. The agreement includes strict enforcement measures like stepped up border security and visa exit tracking that must go into effect before any illegal residents are given official status. The plan is endorsed by conservative newcomers Marco Rubio, of Florida, and Jeff Flake, of Arizona, as well as liberal veterans Charles Schumer, of New York, and Dick Durbin, of Illinois. The senators hope that the broad range of political ideology in the group - from Tea Party darlings to established progressives - will make the plan palatable for both Republicans in the U.S. House and President Barack Obama.

A second bipartisan group in the Senate has also introduced a plan to double the number of U.S. visas for highly-skilled legal immigrants in the hopes of luring more leaders in math, science, engineering and technology to the United States.

Lawmakers say immigration reform is 'set to be passed this year.' Sen. John McCain, pictured, is part of a six-member bipartisan Senate group working on the legislation . Obama promised Hispanic voters that he would make immigration reform one of his top priorities in his second term. He plans to give a major immigration policy speech in Las Vegas, Nevada, on Tuesday where he will lay out his own plan to reform the system. However, immigration reform is also seen as a political necessity by an increasing number of Republicans. Obama won 71 percent of the Hispanic vote in the 2012 election, compared with Republican Mitt Romney's 29 percent, according to exit polls. Hispanic voters were decisive in his victories in the key battleground states of Florida, Colorado and Nevada. Many moderate leaders of the GOP are calling for the party to shift its harsh stance on illegal immigration and allow a 'pathway to citizenship.' 'Look at the last election. We are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we think should be ours,' Arizona Sen John McCain, who has long campaigned for immigration reform, told 'This Week' on Sunday. An Army National Guardsman looks out over the U.S.-Mexico border in Nogales, Arizona . Moderates Republican like McCain argue that most Hispanic voters are socially conservative and would shift their political allegiances if the GOP changes its stance on immigration. However, the Senate deal reflects the reality that most Republicans view a 'pathway to citizenship' as an amnesty that incentives for illegal immigration. Sen Rubio, a Cuban-American who is a rising star in the Republican party, insisted that illegal immigrants 'be required to go to the back of the line' before obtaining citizenship. He, and other conservatives, argue that immigrants who came to the country legally should have preference. Many Republicans in the group insisted on tightening immigration controls before any before any of the citizenship rules took effect. A group of border-state law enforcement officials and policymakers will have to certify that border security has been tightened. Sen. Marco Rubio said the senate is making 'significant progress' Additionally, the Department of Homeland Security must develop a better exit control system to track foreign visitors and ensure the country knows which ones have overstayed their temporary visas. According to some studies, 40 percent of illegal immigrants arrive in the country legally, but do not leave when their visas expire. The proposal puts more onerous citizenship restrictions on illegal immigrants than most Democrats support, however, the Senate group is hoping the tough proposal will help win over votes in the U.S. House. The Republican-controlled House remains the greatest obstacle in Washington to passing a law that would allow a 'pathway to citizenship.' Conservatives in Congress have scuttled numerous bills that would grant legal status to illegal immigrants, under both Obama and President George W Bush.","Four Republicans and four Democrats have agreed to a plan that would step up enforcement, but also provide a 'pathway to citizenship'

"Was Joachim Low's decision to send Mario Gotze on to the field in the 88th minute of the World Cup final a stroke of genius, an extraordinary piece of luck - or was it due to some rather smart wearable technology? According to one of the German national team's performance analysts, it was the latter, with weeks and months of number crunching inspiring Gotze's introduction and his subsequent extra-time winner  against Argentina. Speaking at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas on Wednesday, Darcy Norman revealed that the German national squad wore adidas' miCoach technology during training sessions before and during the World Cup in Brazil. Mario Gotze came on to score Germany's 113th-minute winner against Argentina in the 2014 World Cup final . Coaches using miCoach are able to gather information on their tablet in real time and use the data . The adidas miCoach equipment was used by the Germany team as they prepared for the World Cup . The system can measure power, speed and distance to heart rate, acceleration and field position . Joachim Low's (right) decision to bring on Gotze was partially inspired by wearable technology . The German players hold aloft the World Cup following their 1-0 extra-time victory over Argentina . Small devices worn on the body monitor key performance metrics such as distance, speed, and heart rate of those who wear it. Boots record player-specific data with an innovative miCoach Speed Cell chip placed in the cavity of the outsole, which captures 360 degree movements. Coaches examine data to analyse where players thrive - and where they need to improve. Heart-rate, distance, speed, sprints-per-session and durability of players had all been scrutinised in great detail in the build-up to the showdown at the Maracana. And, due to the delicately-poised nature of the final - it was 0-0 after 88 minutes - Low turned to his bench, saw his personnel and utilised the data he had at his disposal, claims Norman. Gotze's numbers - he was proved to be more effective during five-on-five sessions - helped Low make the decision to give him the nod. Germany's backroom staff had done the number crunching. They had scrutinised the data. Gotze could make the difference - and so it proved. Germany's 2014 World Cup triumph was partially inspired by their use of wearable technology . Manchester United and other professional sports teams use wearable tech to gain information . Established in1995, Prozone is player-tracking software which charts the movement of every individual on the pitch. Using around 10 cameras, the programme creates a two-dimensional animation of the pitch and is capable of registering 3,000 touches of the ball per game. It offers real-time, post-match and opposition analysis and now almost every Barclays Premier League team use the system. Other sports, including rugby, have also embraced it. But Norman, quoted on geekwire.com, explained the usefulness of professional sports teams utilising such technology. He said: 'We quantify the training sessions to get some benchmark to then have meaningful conversations.' Technology is also being used by Premier League clubs (most use Prozone), rugby teams and by a whole variety of top-level sports sides in order to monitor their players. Any striker who is not pulling their weight, any defender who is not winning enough aerial battles and any midfielder who is not passing the ball as accurately as he should be will be caught out by this technology. Arsenal and other Premier League sides monitor how their players are performing using wearable tech . Yossi Benayoun, then of West Ham United, stands by the club's ProZone room in 2006 . A screen grab from Prozone software, during the early stages of its developments during the 2000s . Adidas director of production creation Simon Drabble said: 'There's obviously hard work, passion, tears, sweat, and a few choice words between each game - it's not all about technology. 'But there's no denying the fact that we have a great example of how technology helped train the best of the best to be No 1 in the world.'

"State demographers estimate that whites and Latinos are now an equal share of California's population, with Latinos poised to become a plurality by the end of the year. Latino leaders planned a modest rally Monday at the state Capitol to mark the milestone, which researchers at the state Department of Finance had previously projected would be achieved mid-year. 'At this point, the numbers are very, very close,' said Bill Schooling, head of the demographic research unit of the State Department of Finance. Growing: Latinos comprise about 39 percent of California's population - the exact same percentage as whites, after a long-running demographic shift that already has altered state politics, the economy and culture . He said officials do not plan to estimate the exact date when Latinos begin overtaking whites, but they are expected to become a majority in early 2014. Whites and Latinos each comprise about 39 percent of California's population after a long-running demographic shift that already has altered state politics, the economy and culture. Monday's rally was intended to mark the occasion and remind state lawmakers of Latinos' increasing clout, said Orlando Fuentas, president of the Latino Democratic Club of Sacramento. 'We want to recognize this momentous change by acknowledging the responsibilities that lay ahead for our community at large as well as our state,' Fuentas said in a statement. Rally: Latino leaders have held a series of rallies at the state Capitol calling for equal rights for Latinos . In the new year, California is expected to become the second state, behind New Mexico, in which Latinos are the largest racial or ethnic group. Whites currently lack a majority in only two states -- Hawaii and New Mexico. The state estimates that in 2020, Hispanics will account for 40.7 percent of California's population while whites will make up 36.6 percent. In 2030, the population is projected to be nearly 44 percent Hispanic and about 34 percent white. In 2060, Hispanics will make up 48 percent of the population compared to 30 percent for whites, according to state projections. Blacks are expected to slip from nearly 6 percent in 2010 to just more than 4 percent by 2060, while the Asian population, now just below 13 percent, may grow slightly.","Whites and Latinos each comprise about 39% of California's population .

The former England skipper's decision to end his long association with the Anfield club was, in part, due to being told his playing time would be managed by Reds boss Brendan Rodgers. It appears that will not be a problem at the Galaxy, whose head coach Arena has already started calling Gerrard 'Stevie' and is keen to get him playing further up the pitch. 'I will manage his minutes, I'm going to try and get him on the field as much as possible,' said Arena in a conference call. 'My best guess is that we will play him closer to a forward than towards our centre-backs. He's a player with obviously very good attacking qualities and we want to get him pushed as close to goal as we can, when we can. 'I think we can accommodate that through a variety of positions. It'll take a little bit of time but we'll get it figured out by the time Stevie arrives.' Arena revealed the Galaxy have been tracking Gerrard for some time. But he admitted to thinking, until recently, the possibility of bringing him to the west coast club was remote. 'On and off over the years, Stevie has always been a name that we've examined as a potential player to come to the LA Galaxy,' said Arena. 'I would say my thinking was that it was going to be a long shot to acquire Stevie, but as we got closer towards the end of the year the interest on both parties picked up and we were very fortunate to be able to secure a deal.' The Reds icon admitted that he was a 'Scouser through and through' and would have to adapt to new lifestyle . Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment . Gerrard assured Liverpool fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club . Arena is confident Gerrard will have few problems adapting at the StubHub Center. 'He's English speaking which makes the transition a little bit easier, he's been to the United States a number of times, knows players on our team so I think when he steps in he'll be able to contribute right away,' said Arena. 'He understands the challenge that lies ahead, he knows this isn't going to be an easy process, he has no desire to come to a league where he's in retirement. 'He wants to continue to excel, he's such a great professional that I think that we're going to see he's going to come in and make our team better right from the start.' Gerrard is expected to link up with former Liverpool team-mate Robbie Keane at the Galaxy, with Arena confirming he expects the Irishman to remain with the club despite speculation linking him with a move. 'They're two outstanding players, they've played together before, they know each other,' added Arena. 'I think in a short period they're going to be able to have a great understanding of each other, and I'm quite confident that we'll see that they'll be able to create chances for the LA Galaxy.'","Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard to join Los Angeles Galaxy in July .

The Reds icon admitted that he was a 'Scouser through and through' and would have to adapt to new lifestyle . Gerrard has guaranteed LA Galaxy supporters that they can expect 100 per cent commitment . Gerrard assured Liverpool fans that his departure will not spell the end of his relationship with the club . My next team is going to be La Galaxy. I'm really excited for a new challenge in my life - that's the team I will join at the end of the season. Their pursuing me was very aggressive. The talks Ive had with them are very positive, they basically told me what I wanted to hear. They told me about the winning mentality of the club, their aims and what their goals are for the future and it basically suits me at this stage of my career so I will be hopefully going over there to win some medals and finish my career over there. There's obviously a bonus of where the LA Galaxy are locateed as well. That will be nice for my family to come out of our comfort zone and try something different. It's really exciting both on and off the pitch but the most important thing is that I go there and it's a success on the pitch and then hopefully I can enjoy it off the pitch as well. The big challenge is going to be settling in, I've lived in Liverpool all my life. I'm a Scouser through and through. I love my City. I love my roots. But, you only get one life, it's important to try different things and experiences and it's also a big thing for my children too - to take them out of their comfort zone and give them experiences that will hopefully help them develop as humans as well. It's perfect timing for this new challenge. I'm really excited and looking forward to it, but I've still got a few things that I've got to try and achieve before I go so my focus is on that. There will be plenty of time to get excited at the end of the season about the new move. It's the right time for a new challenge, a fresh challenge at this point of my life and an exciting one too. I'm going to be moving to the most successful team in the US. I've watched a lot of their games and I also know a few of the players that have been there and sampled it and I've heard great things about it so for this stage of my career I believe the timing is right to move on. I still feel like a player, I still feel like I can perform for a number of years so I want to go to a club with a winning mentality - a team that is used to winning but also a team that's got people within there that want to win in the future. I know the players have got a winning mentality, they've proved it over a number of years. Having spoken to the manager, Bruce Arena, and also the people above him - they're very aggressive and they want success and that's what I want. That's how I want to finish my career so they are the reasons that I chose LA Galaxy. I'd like to think I've got the same attitude as the people that have tried to make this signing happen - the manager, the CEO and the owner - they all seem to me to be like winners and that is how I see myself. I'm very professional and go about my work to a good standard on a daily basis. I like to try and find consistency. I hope I can go there and play my part and contribute to help bring more silverware to this team. What I can guarantee is that I will go there and work hard and I will make sacrifices and be dedicated to perform at a consistent level and hopefully play my part in success for this team. Football is my life and will continue to be for a couple of years. I'm not going over here for a holiday or to enjoy myself. I am going over here to win and if I win and play well then my life becomes more enjoyable. My message to Liverpool fans, I owe them a lot. It's been a privilege to play for them and represent them for all these years and I will continue to do that until the end of the season and I can promise them I will give everything I have got within to try and bring success this season. And hopefully come back - that's the message, my relationship with Liverpool doesn't end in the summer. In fact it will never end.

"The couple sitting in the audience were clearly in the first flush of romance. Watching them from a distance, there was an almost tangible frisson of possibility about them: the way he put an arm protectively around her back as he led her to her seat; the way her smile twinkled as he leaned in to speak. Even though I was singing on stage, I was unable to take my eyes off them. Because not only had I brought them together in the first place, but that couple in the audience were my 80-year-old grandmother Patricia and her new 'special friend' Roy Lewis, 75. Nan, a former seamstress, and Roy, an ex-English teacher, met last year before one of my concerts. Both had been widowed in recent years and become shadows of their former selves. Second chance: Patricia and Roy have become like happy-go-lucky teenagers since they met . I feared for Nan's health. She'd tried to commit suicide following the death of her husband of 60 years - my grandfather, Ken - and was frail, vulnerable and lonely. Meanwhile, Roy was a ghost of a man. He'd lost his wife Annette, 72, in 2008 to a stroke after years of her suffering from dementia and was simply struggling to get on with life as best he could. Neither of them ever expected to find happiness again and thought they were destined to become one of the 2.5 million elderly people in Britain who describe themselves as 'lonely'. Then fate - and I - intervened. What greater gift can a granddaughter give to her loving Nan than helping her find love? Until Roy, I feared there'd never be anyone else, because my grandparents were made for each other. Nan says she knew the minute she set eyes on my grandfather in 1950 that she would marry him. She was 15, he was 19, and both were hanging out with friends one afternoon in her home town of Reading when he made a kissing noise at her as she walked by. He was only there for a day trip, having travelled from his home in Walthamstow, East London. They exchanged flirtatious banter, he followed her home that evening and her mother invited him in for tea. Matchmaker: Rebecca is delighted her singing brought the couple together . Four years later, they married, moved to London and had my mum, Carole, in 1957 and her sister, Sue, in 1959. A decade or so later they moved to Exmouth. Like many women of that era, Nan was perfectly happy being the homemaker and wouldn't dream of letting Granddad, an engineer, do any ironing, washing or cleaning. His dinner was always waiting on the table. The secret of their happy marriage boiled down to one thing - respect. And a kiss and a cuddle every day. It was in 2008 that we all noticed Granddad was ill. He started refusing to walk into their lounge at home, and it was my mum who realised it was because he was hallucinating and thought there was no floor. Nan was desperate for him to remain the man he'd always been, the one who would protect and care for her. It wasn't until one night when he 'held her up at gunpoint' using his walking stick and wouldn't let her leave the chair, that she accepted something was seriously wrong. Granddad was rushed into hospital and diagnosed with dementia. Nan went to pieces. Distraught, she made the first of two attempts to take her life. When Granddad died two weeks later in February 2010, Nan was in such a terrible state and as frail as a little bird that, in my own mind, I said goodbye to her, too. 'I went with Ken when he died,' she'd say. Thankfully, she survived and, as a family, we were desperate for her to find peace and happiness again. First love: Patricia was distraught when her husband, Ken, died in 2010 after suffering from dementia . Little did I know that in March 2012 events were beginning to conspire to lead her to just that. After watching me perform in Cardiff - I'm a professional soprano and support artists such as Russell Watson - a gentleman approached me in the street to say he had loved my singing. He introduced himself as Roy and bought some signed CDs for his family and friends. I forgot all about him until a few months later when he sent me an email through my website saying he was going to watch me perform in Hampshire. Sadly, he got stuck in traffic, arriving only after the concert had finished, so I invited him to come for a drink with my mum and me. Over coffee, Roy told me about Annette, his late wife, who'd been a soprano, too. They'd met while teaching in the same school - he also worked backstage at the local amateur operatic society where she sang - and married in 1974. They had two daughters, but Annette had died from a stroke in 2008 after battling dementia for 15 years. It left Roy, who'd never missed one of her concerts, bereft. When the emotions consumed him, he'd take himself off for drives and walks to try to lift his mood, but he says the first time he felt his spirits lift was when he heard me sing in Cardiff. After that, Roy came to almost all of my shows in 2012. Whenever I sang Mi Chiamano Mimi from La Boheme, Roy would have to reach for a handkerchief to dry his tears. He later explained that when Annette had been very ill, she'd sometimes suddenly sing that song, word and pitch-perfect. For those few minutes, he said, it was like having the old, lucid Annette back. Nan also came to many of those concerts as she'd always been my biggest fan. One afternoon I introduced them after we bumped into Roy outside the concert hall and I invited him to join us for lunch. Both fans of her work: Patricia and Roy met at one of Rebecca's concerts . They exchanged basic pleasantries, but I'd never have pushed them further together for fear of putting pressure on them. Although physically Roy looks nothing like Granddad, lots of things reminded me of him. He's calm and thoughtful, he listens intently during conversations and he's practical. I remember watching once as Nan struggled to open a packet of sandwiches, only for Roy to produce a penknife from his pocket and cut the cellophane for her. Over the coming months, as they bumped into one another at my performances, their initial pleasantries gave way to enthusiastic chatter. By spring last year, they'd swapped phone numbers and would often call each other for a chat. They bonded over their traumatic experiences of caring for and losing their spouses. It was a year ago, in September last year, that they came to a concert together. This was when I spotted them together in the audience. I was thrilled. Nan is adamant they weren't a couple at this stage. But she didn't need to be asked twice when Roy suggested he escort her ('I couldn't believe what was happening to me!' she said). Two months later, my hopes of a romance were confirmed. When they arrived to watch me perform in Exmouth, Nan said to me: 'Give me a hug.' Then she turned to Roy and said the same. Despite his blushes, they hugged and kissed cheeks, and Roy declared: 'That was nice.' 'Well, if you feel it, go with it!' responded Nan. Since that glorious moment, they speak most days on the phone and see each other at least once a week. Nan has confided that they love to share a kiss. And why not? They met when both of them were facing the emptiness of old age and widowhood stretching out before them. 23 million Britons have a close friend or family member with dementia . Nan lives in Devon and Roy in Bristol, but they travel to see each other. They also make regular trips to York to stay with my husband and me. Both families are thrilled they've found one another; for us, it's wonderful to know Nan has someone as lovely as Roy to look out for her. She says she now has a reason to look forward rather than back. Nan's the typical doting female - she massages balm into Roy's legs as he suffers with cramps. She notices when he needs to straighten his collar and calls to him to go steady on the stairs. Meanwhile, he prints off information about me from the internet and burns DVDs of my performances from YouTube as Nan doesn't have a computer. It's very sweet. In fact, they behave like happy-go-lucky teenagers. Nan tells me they'll often giggle when sharing a nightcap in a hotel bar before bed - strictly separate rooms! - realising that neither of their families know they're on an impromptu adventure. Nan seems more content now she has someone to fuss over, and when Roy smiles, it reaches his eyes. It's still early days but their time is now spent enjoying walks on the beach, fish-and-chip lunches by the sea and leisurely drives through the countryside. And, of course, they remain my most ardent fans. Interview by Sadie Nicholas .

"Lionel Messi has pledged to stay at Barcelona amid talk of a move to the Premier League. The Argentine, who has been at the Nou Camp since he was a boy, has become disenchanted with the way in which new boss Luis Enrique manages the Catalans. And that looked as if it would come to a head sooner rather than later, but Spanish paper Sport report that Messi will remain at the club. Lionel Messi had pledged to stay with Barcelona after talks with club president Josep Bartomeu . It is believed the Argentina international has fallen out with Barcelona manager Luis Enrique . Former Watford manager Oscar Garcia could replace Enrique if the Barcelona coach leaves the Nou Camp . Former Brighton and Watford head coach Oscar Garcia is surprisingly being sounded out should Enrique be given his marching orders. That looks all the more likely now Messi has held talks with president Josep Bartomeu, with the pair discussing his fears. The 27-year-old is said to want a restructuring of how the first team is organised. 'Messi will do what makes him happiest,' said Cesc Fabregas, speaking to Spanish radio programme Al Primer Toque on Onda Cero. 'Personally, as his friend, colleague and footballer, if you gave me the chance to play with him again, I would welcome it. 'I don't know Luis Enrique. I do know Leo and I doubt very much that what is being said is happening, because he's a very relaxed guy and I've never seen any of that in the three years we spent together.'

"Canadian teenager Eugenie Bouchard comfortably defeated an out-of-sorts Serena Williams 6-2, 6-1 at the Hopman Cup in Perth on Tuesday. The American world No 1's body language throughout the contest suggested she would rather have been anywhere else than on the blue hard courts in Western Australia. An on-court espresso helped spark her into life as she overcame a first set bagel to beat Italy's Flavia Pennetta 0-6, 6-3, 6-0 on Monday in the round robin mixed team event but nothing could help bring her out of Tuesday's malaise. Eugenie Bouchard waves to the crowd at the Perth Arena after claiming victory against Serena Williams . Bouchard plays a backhand on her way to victory over Williams at the Hopman Cup . World No 1 Williams shows her frustrations as she is thrashed by Bouchard on Tuesday in Perth . Sluggish footwork and uncharacteristically slow serves allowed Bouchard to break the 33-year-old with ease as the Canadian bounced back from a 6-0, 6-4 thrashing by Czech Lucie Safarova in her opener. Williams had complained of jet-lag following her previous day's efforts against Pennetta but she looked in good spirits as she teamed up with John Isner to win their mixed doubles against the Italians for a 3-0 whitewash later on Monday evening. Williams, who did not call the trainer to court on Tuesday, showed flashes of her usual brilliance against Bouchard as she went for her shots but never had the consistency, or the fight, to beat the Canadian.

"Rafael Nadal's first tournament match since surgery last November ended in a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 defeat against German qualifier Michael Berrer in the first round of the Qatar Open on Tuesday. Nadal, the defending champion, had three break points on Berrer's serve in the final game of the match, but couldn't convert them to level for 5-5. The second-seeded Spaniard, who was broken in the first game of the third set, was clearly paying the price for a lack of matches in the second half of 2014. Rafael Nadal was thumped out of the Qatar Open by German qualifier Michael Berrer . Berrer triumphed 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 in less than two hours in Doha against Nadal . He was sidelined for three months with a right wrist injury after Wimbledon and then had an appendectomy in early November. It was 34-year-old Berrer's first victory over a player ranked in the top five. The 127th-ranked Berrer had already announced that this is his final season on the tour. In a sharp contrast to Nadal's exit, top-ranked Novak Djokovic started his season with a 6-2, 6-1 win over Serbian countryman Dusan Lajovic. Nadal was appearing for only the eighth time since last summer's Wimbledon . Djokovic's first-round victory took 59 minutes. He put 72 percent of his first serves in play, and was successful on five of six break-point opportunities. He is making his first appearance at the Doha tournament. Historically, he hasn't played a sanctioned tournament in the first week of the year. Djokovic withdrew from the Abu Dhabi exhibition final last week with the flu, but showed no lingering signs of illness against Lajovic. Third-seeded Tomas Berdych also advanced to the second round with a 6-1, 6-4 win over Denis Istomin of Uzbekistan.

"Aljaz Bedene is hoping to be granted British citizenship this week, and has his sights set on representing his adopted country at the Davis Cup in March. It emerged last year that the Slovenian, who has lived in Britain since 2008, was intending to switch nationalities. But his hopes of playing Davis Cup for Britain appeared to have been scuppered by a change in the rules to prevent players representing two different countries that came into force at the start of 2015. Aljaz Bedene is hoping to be granted British citizenship this week ahead of the Davis Cup in March . Bedene had not expected to complete the citizenship process until next month but he rushed through it and sent off all his paperwork in time. Provided the 25-year-old, who is through to the second round of the Chennai Open, is successful in his application, he would be eligible for Britain's Davis Cup World Group first-round match against the United States in Glasgow in March. Bedene said: 'I gave all the papers to the Home Office and I'm waiting for their response. It's quite an exciting period for me now. 'Although I'm at the tournament and I don't want to think too much about this, it would be really nice to get approval from the Home Office that I can be a citizen of the UK. If Bedene is successful, he would become British number three behind Andy Murray (above) and James Ward . 'My solicitor is taking care of it and it should be in the next couple of days I think. 'I had to rush with the life in the UK test and English exam because of the new ITF rules but I'm still positive, I think it will be all right.' With a ranking of 156, Bedene would become the British number three behind Andy Murray and James Ward. But he has been ranked as highly as 71 and his current standing is a reflection of 18 months of injury problems. The option of selecting Bedene would be a welcome one for Davis Cup captain Leon Smith, who has long bemoaned the lack of strength in depth available to him. Davis Cup captain Leon Smith (left) would certainly welcome the addition of Bedene to his playing roster . But the Scot will be aware it is a divisive issue and, given Ward's good form in 2014 in Davis Cup and other tournaments, it would be a huge shock if he was not named as the number two singles player behind Murray against the US. Bedene - who played three matches for Slovenia between 2010 and 2012, all in dead rubbers - said: 'I'm in contact with Leon and he's also excited to hear the news. We're all hoping it goes through.' Bedene made a fine start to the new season by coming through qualifying in Chennai before beating 88th-ranked Lukas Lacko on Tuesday to set up a second-round match against Feliciano Lopez. From India, he heads to Melbourne where he will play in Australian Open qualifying, and he is optimistic a better season lies ahead. He said: 'It's great to start the season with qualies and a first-round win, especially against a top-100 player. I'm satisfied with my performances so far and I'm looking forward to the next match. 'I'm looking forward to playing a full season finally. I want to show that I'm much better than the ranking shows.'","Aljaz Bedene is hoping to be granted British citizenship this week .

The Serbian centre back played just over an hour in a back three for Watford Under 21s against Leeds United this week. They scored five first-half goals in a 6-1 victory in the Premier League Under 21 Cup.

"Stephen Gallacher believes golf’s persistent slow play ‘cheats’ should be banned from tournaments – even if it means missing a major. The Scot pounced on Rory McIlroy’s recent plea for the game to be speeded up, recommending automatic one-shot penalties for anyone going over the clock. 'Everything's so instant now and everyone doesn't have as much time as they used to,' the world No 1 told the BBC. 'So you maybe try some way of speeding the game up.' And Gallacher believes the game should follow the lead of cricket, pointing to England captain Alastair Cook’s recent one-game suspension for his team’s slow over rate as an example. Stephen Gallacher (right) has backed Ryder Cup team-mate Rory McIlroy's (left) call to speed up golf . Gallacher believes the game should follow the lead of cricket in tackling slow play . ‘I think certain forms of slow play is cheating,’ said the Gallacher. ‘I think guys who are slow, who know they are slow and get fined all the time but don’t do anything about it are putting people off. They are certainly putting viewers off. The bit I think is cheating is they’ve got two paces, speeding up once they’ve been put on the clock. ‘We are on at the kids in our foundation all the time to speed up. Apparently all the committee guys say every week that’s what they talk about - but nothing happens. ‘I think on the pro tour you have to make it ruthless and say that’s it a shot penalty. You can’t have a monetary thing. ‘In cricket, if he doesn’t meet his over rate he’s out. You could do that. Two-shot penalties and you are suspended the next week - and it might be The Open. Gallacher and McIlroy both say it is time to address the issue of pace of play in golf . The Scot has enjoyed his best year as a professional, which included winning the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles . ‘Guys are never ready. The guy who plays third can slow everything up. By the time he gets to play, he’s not even got his glove on yet. As you get older you learn. I go out with my mates and go round in two and a half hours. We are always ready, with the glove out. ‘Guys on Tour playing third still have to get the glove on and get the yardage book out and you think: “Are you kidding?” Look at putting. Everybody looks at the putt from one side but the third guy hasn’t looked, and he ends up looking at it from four different sides.’ Gallacher, aware that often some of the worst offenders are young players fresh to the professional ranks, believes the key lies in education – and reviving the old ‘Apollo week’, named after an equipment manufacturer, that the European Tour used to run for rookies. ‘You need an Apollo week,’ he said, adding: ‘Get some ex-Tour pros in to show them what to do. Not many of us have bad times, the older generation. ‘You’ll p*** someone off. It has to be a uniformed approach. You go to the Challenge Tour and you only have three referees. How do you police that? The players have to do it themselves. ‘When I was first came on tour we had Apollo weeks. The new guys need something like that just to reiterate what happens on tour. They have to know what goes on. We had media training, we had TV training, you met the travel guys. It was like a big boot camp for a week and it was all laid out. That’s the way forward.’","Stephen Gallacher says players should be banned for persistent slow play .

"Mesut Ozil could make his long-awaited return against Stoke City on Sunday, with Arsene Wenger admitting Arsenal have missed his creative talents this season. The German playmaker, a £42.5million signing from Real Madrid in 2013, was ruled out for three months with a knee injury after picking up an injury against Chelsea in October. But it seems Ozil is now raring to go having been involved in full training sessions once again, and he even revealed his anticipation on social media.

Wenger believes Ozil can give Arsenal a new imputus as they look to a secure another top-four finish. Arsene Wenger says the German international is 'an exceptional football player' 'He is an exceptional football player,' the Arsenal manager said in his pre-match press conference on Friday. 'He always gives you continuity in your game. He's a very creative player and ideally you want all your best players available. 'The advantage of these players - for example Giroud, Koscielny, Debuchy, Ozil - at the moment where most of the players in the league have played 26 or 27 games in their legs, they have four or five.

"Gus Poyet says any North-East football fan should buy a ticket for the Stadium of Light to see Steven Gerrard in action for the last time. The Liverpool skipper will play his final game in the region on Saturday lunchtime having confirmed his move to the MLS and LA Galaxy earlier this week. Poyet played against Gerrard during his time with Chelsea and Spurs, and holds the former England captain in the highest regard. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard will be leaving his boyhood club at the end of the season for LA Galaxy . Sunderland manager Gus Poyet has hailed Gerrard's (centre left) impact throughout a glorious career . ‘If I was a football fan, I'd go to the Stadium of Light. I'd go just to see him,’ said the Sunderland head coach. ‘He's the kind of player where it's worth paying the price of a ticket just to watch him. ‘When he came on at Anfield against us, the first thing he did was to switch play with a ball from the outside of his foot. That alone was worth a ticket because I don't think too many players could do that. ‘He's that type of player. Fans in the North-East might not be able to see that again, so this is a great opportunity. ‘Realistically, I'd prefer him not to play but as a football fan I always want the best players to play. Patrick van Aanholt is set to start vs Liverpool after scoring Sunderland's FA Cup winner against Leeds . ‘But we're going to miss him, we'll just have to go to the States to watch him now.’ Poyet, though, feels that some of the criticism aimed at Gerrard – namely his failure to win a Premier League title – is unfair. ‘It's typical of football, we only concentrate on the bad things,’ he said. ‘He won the Champions League, he won the UEFA and FA Cup. He won the lot pretty much, so why are we going to focus only on the one thing missing? That's football. They were close last year and I'm sure that was terrible for him because that's the closest you can get.’ Poyet admits the Mackems are still working hard to recruit players during this January transfer window .","Sunderland host Liverpool in the Premier League on Saturday .

"Brendan Rodgers has made it his ambition to give Steven Gerrard the perfect send-off — and birthday present — by leading Liverpool to FA Cup glory. Liverpool’s captain will move to America, to either LA Galaxy or New York Red Bulls, once his contract expires at the end of this season and, as it stands, his last game is scheduled to be against Stoke City in the Barclays Premier League at the Britannia Stadium on May 24. The FA Cup final, however, is staged on May 30 this year — the day Gerrard turns 35 — and Rodgers believes there could be no better way for his captain to end his lifelong association with Liverpool than by walking around Wembley clutching one of the game’s biggest prizes. VIDEO Scroll down to see Rodgers talking about the future leadership of Liverpool .

Gerrard celebrates winning the 2006 FA Cup at the Millennium Stadium with Rafa Benitez (right) Gerrard won his first FA Cup with Liverpool in 2001 - one of three trophies the Reds won that season . Steven Gerrard could end his Liverpool career by winning the FA Cup on May 30 - should Brendan Rodgers' side make it to the final. He has twice won the FA Cup before in 2001 and 2006 and lost another final in 2012. Gerrard is expected to start Monday's third-round clash against League Two side AFC Wimbledon, with Rodgers showing how seriously he is taking the competition by naming a strong side. He certainly does not want this to be the last time Gerrard plays in the FA Cup. ‘Our aim was always to win a trophy this year and even more so now with that added incentive,’ said Rodgers. ‘To have a captain who has been a monumental figure for this club leaving there’d be no greater tribute than to reach a final, particularly an FA Cup final. ‘To see him lift a trophy, that is what dreams are all about. It would be a great way for him to end his career and certainly we don’t want Stoke City to be our last game of the season.’ It has been an emotional time for Gerrard and the strain he has been under was illustrated during a 13-minute interview with Liverpool’s television station that was aired on Saturday evening; there were a couple of occasions when he had to pause to compose himself. Gerrard spoke to Liverpool's in-house TV channel in an exclusive interview released on Saturday evening . Gerrard revealed he had a chat with Brendan Rodgers about his future at the club before deciding to leave . Gerrard took the decision to leave after Rodgers explained to him his amount of playing time would be ‘managed’ next season, the midfielder admitting he would find it hard to accept being a squad player, given he has been a fixture in the team throughout his career. ‘I’m bright enough to realise that it is the right thing for everyone,’ said Gerrard. Rodgers is now looking at others to step into the leadership role at the club. Jordan Henderson will almost certainly become club captain when Gerrard hands over the armband — ‘It was one of the reasons I made him vice-captain,’ according to Rodgers — and there are others, such as Raheem Sterling, in whom the manager sees potential . Sterling is edging closer to signing a new long-term contract, and Rodgers added: ‘Hopefully they can become that type of leader and character that makes up successful teams.’","Liverpool face AFC Wimbledon in the FA Cup third round on Monday night .

The Chargers were down by 14 points after three quarters but Rivers responded magnificently, throwing two touchdown passes, the second an 11-yard effort to Malcolm Floyd with just 29 seconds left to send the game to overtime and they eventually won 38-35. The result does not guarantee San Diego (9-6) a spot in the play-offs, but it gives them a fighting chance. 'I was the main reason we were in that big hole (at half-time), but it's awesome to fight back to win,' Rivers said. 'We said this is the first round of the playoffs for us. We won the first round. We've got a long way to go though.'","The Eagles lost 24-27 in Washington - their fourth defeat in six .

"A photo of Tottenham Hotspur's striking sensation Harry Kane has emerged from when he played as a youngster for north London rivals Arsenal. The 21-year-old, who has scored 17 goals in all competitions for Spurs this season, was on the Gunners' books as an seven-year-old after impressing scouts when playing for his local side Ridgeway Rovers. But Arsenal opted against keeping Kane, releasing him after just a year at the club, and he has since gone on to prove the doubters wrong, starring for Mauricio Pochettino's Spurs side. Harry Kane (front row, far left) pictured as a youngster for Arsenal along with the likes of Benik Afobe (back row, second left), Chuks Aneke (back row, second right), and Nico Yennaris (front row, far right) Kane has been in sensational form for Tottenham Hotspur - most recently netting a double against Chelsea on New Year's Day . Nacer Chadli (right) celebrates with the in-form Spurs forward after scoring their fifth goal against the Blues . After a stunning first-half of the season Kane is now in line to make the step up to the England senior side . Benik Afobe - Still at Arsenal (on loan at MK Dons) -  0 appearances for Arsenal . Nico Yannaris - Brentford - Four appearances for Arsenal . Chuks Aneke - Zulte Waregem - One appearance for Arsenal . Now an image of the youngster has circulated on social media, with him lining up for an Arsenal squad photo at a youth summer tournament in July 2001. Kane, along with the likes of Benik Afobe, Chuks Aneke, Nico Yennaris and Jamie Lawrence, all featured for the Under-8 side at the Watford International Festival at Parmiter's School. Arsenal were the first club to take Kane in when he and now Brentford full back Yennaris were spotted at the age of seven playing for Ridgeway Rovers, a junior club in Chingford, London, famed for producing the likes of David Beckham and Andros Townsend. But after failing to make the cut, the 21-year-old returned to his local side before eventually signing for Arsenal's arch rivals Tottenham in July 2009. After various loan spells further down the football pyramid with the likes of Leyton Orient, Millwall and Norwich City, before a brief spell at Leicester City in the 2012-13 season, six years on Kane has finally made the grade in the Premier League and is on the verge of a call-up to the England squad.

"London Irish boss Brian Smith believes Harry Allen deserves another chance after the hooker made his first start since serving a one-year drugs ban against Saracens on Saturday. Allen tested positive for benzoylecgonine, a metabolite of cocaine, and a non-specified stimulant during a drugs test in November 2013 and was subsequently sacked by his former club, Harlequins. The 23-year-old was picked up on a short-term arrangement by the Exiles last month and, as a result of mounting injury problems in the front row, played in the 22-6 defeat at Allianz Park. Hooker Harry Allen takes the ball forward for London Irish after being given a start after a year-long drug ban . Exiles director of rugby Brian Smith says Allen 'made a mistake' and 'deserves a second chance' Asked if there were any concerns about signing the former England Under 18 front row, Smith said: ‘You consider all of those things obviously, but he’s a young bloke and he’s made a mistake. Like everyone, he deserves a second chance. ‘Once I got to see and speak to him, I was convinced that he’s on the straight and narrow. He’s a talented young player. It’s obviously been a really tough 12 months for him, as you’d appreciate, and he’s been in the wilderness.’ Irish's George Skivington receives a line-out throw from Allen (not pictured) in loss to Saracens . Man of the match Billy Vunipola is tackled during the match at Allianz Park on Saturday . Irish were overpowered in the Premiership tie, but Allen still managed a decent 82 per cent line-out accuracy. He will be hoping to be involved against Exeter next week and Smith hinted that the forward could be given a prolonged run in the match-day squad. ‘I said to him in the changing room after the game that he’s put himself back on the radar,’ said Smith. ‘He hasn’t played much rugby in the last year and he played 80 minutes out there. I think he will sleep pretty well.’","Harry Allen played 80 minutes for London Irish in loss to Saracens .

"Sam Burgess has admitted his quest to hurriedly master the mysteries of rugby union is proving harder than he imagined, with the line-out a particular source of confusion.

"UEFA president Michel Platini and Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger have sent messages of support to France in the wake of the terrorist attacks this week. Twelve people were killed in Wednesday's attack on the office of satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo in Paris, which had been threatened before for its caricatures of the Prophet Muhammed. In the fallout from that incident a policewoman was also shot in the capital on Thursday, before the main suspect in that killing and two brothers linked to the Charlie Hebdo strike were shot dead by French police as officers brought two further sieges to an end on Friday. UEFA president Michel Platini paid tribute to France, and the victims of the attack in Paris . People gathered around candles and pens at the in Paris in support of the victims after the terrorist attack . Tributes have poured in from all over the world in recent days and Platini added his voice to them in a letter to the French Football Federation (FFF) president, Noel Le Graet. Platini said: 'On behalf of the extensive European football family, I wish to express our sadness and solidarity with the sportsmen and women in France, as well as with the French people, who have been cruelly affected in what they hold most dear - the universal values of human rights, which were expressed in France more than two centuries ago. 'Today, those values can be summed up with the phrase: At UEFA, We are all Charlie.' Wenger earlier expressed his hope that the attacks will not polarise the French population along religious or ethnic lines. 'It is a dreadful and terrible situation,' he said. 'It is shocking. I think the whole country is shocked. France is a country with a freedom of speech, it has a big history and to think in a country like France you can die today because of your ideas and the way you want to speak is absolutely shocking. 'I hope at the moment that the whole country is united and I hope it will not create a divided country, the consequences of that would be terrible.' Arsene Wenger said the consequences would be terrible if the attack divided the country . Terrorists emegre from their car after fleeing the massacre at the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo in Paris . The Arsenal manager highlighted France's long history of freedom of speech . Many other stars from the world of sport showed their support on Thursday with the likes of tennis stars Jo-Wilfried Tsonga and Marion Bartoli posting messages on social network sites, as did Formula One driver Romain Grosjean. The FFF, as well as the governing body for French rugby union, announced that all fixtures played under their auspices this weekend would observe a minute's silence beforehand. The French Basketball Federation, the French Cyclo-cross Championships at Pontchateau and the Ski-cross World Cup event at Val Thorens will also all hold a minute's silence to honour the victims of the attack labelled by President Francois Hollande as: 'an act of exceptional barbarism'. The Ligue 1 match between Lyon and Toulouse on Sunday has also been moved back by three hours to avoid a clash with national tributes to the victims of this week's Paris shootings. A major rally in Paris is planned in support of those who died. The Ligue de Football Professionnel announced in a statement on its website: 'In agreement with Lyon, Toulouse and the broadcaster beIN SPORTS, the match Lyon - Toulouse, initially scheduled for Sunday at 2pm (1pm GMT), has been moved to the same day at 5pm (4pm GMT).

"As a boyhood Celtic fan and a huge admirer of the English Premier League, Stephen Hendrie could soon face a dilemma if interest in the left-back solidifies into concrete bids. As Sportmail revealed recently, Hamilton chairman Les Gray is bracing himself for a £2million offer from West Ham for the latest gem off the New Douglas Park production line. And on Sunday, Celtic joined the long list of clubs watching the gifted teenager when Ronny Deila’s assistant John Collins scouted Hendrie during Accies’ 1-0 win at St Johnstone. Stephen Hendrie has been linked with a number of Premier League clubs as well as Celtic . If the 19-year old would find it difficult choosing between potential suitors in the east end of London and Glasgow, however, he is more clear-cut on other issues. He has no doubt in his mind that he is old enough to make the next big step in his career, provided the right bid is received by the New Douglas Park club. ‘I’m 20 next week,’ said Hendrie, who has helped Hamilton into third in the Scottish Premiership but is out of contract at the end of the season. ‘I don’t think that’s too young or too old to move from Hamilton. ‘I’m a Celtic fan and obviously the (English) Premier League is one of the best leagues in the world. Hendrie has made more than 100 appearances for the Hamilton first team . ‘That’s my dream - you want to reach as high a level as you can and if I can get to the Premier League that would be brilliant. ‘But the Accies would need to see if it’s the right offer. If it is, they say they’ll never stand in anybody’s way. They are a great club like that. If they accepted it, there is not much I could do. ‘It’s good massive clubs are getting mentioned. But I just want to get my head down and keep doing well. ‘Just now, the Accies are flying and I’m loving every minute of it. We just want to finish as high as we can.’ With over 100 first-team appearances for Accies before the age of 20, Hendrie is following a similar path tread by James McArthur and James McCarthy. Both gained experience at Accies before finding fame and fortune down south as FA Cup winners with Wigan before moving to Crystal Palace and Everton, respectively. The 19-year-old believes he is ready to make a move to a bigger club . Accies manager Alex Neil has long stated nothing would please him more than to see the next generation of gems in Lanarkshire win a life-changing big-money move. But he has warned Hendrie and Scottish Premiership leading scorer Tony Andreu that if they get distracted by transfer speculation this month they risk their starting places. ‘The boys all know that, if they continue to do well here, if something does crop up, we won’t stand in their way,’ said Neil. ‘But if they take their eye off the ball and think they will get their move without anything happening then they could find themselves out the team and that move will quickly disappear. ‘But they are all completely focused. Not one of them has mentioned a single thing about transfers. Hamilton manager Alex Neil says the club won't stand in Hendrie's way if the right offer came in . ‘We’ve had no contact at all so far for any of our players. ‘It’s still early days in January but most clubs, unless they are prepared to pay top dollar, will wait and try and get their targets on the cheap. ‘We don’t want to sell anyone but at the same time we are a selling club. And this club is good at making sure it gets the maximum for anybody moving on. ‘If we receive a deal which is right for the player and the club, we won’t stand in their way. But no one will be leaving here on the cheap.’ Should Accies swell their coffers this month, their tried-and-trusted youth development-focused business model will remain. But the Hamilton boss said that the club have not received any contact regarding any of their players . While being third in the league is a source of pride for Neil, so too is the Accies Under-20s being three clear of Aberdeen at the top of the SPFL Development League. ‘Any money which comes will go back into the youth academy,’ continued the manager. ‘I might potentially get some money to sign somebody but it will be a free transfer. We won’t spend any money buying someone. ‘We are very well run, and when someone else goes, we will generally replace them with one of our younger players. ‘I’ve got a few in the Under-20s who are itching to go. They are top of their youth league and some are ready to go in the first-team right now. We will give them their chance.’","Stephen Hendrie has made more than 100 appearances for Hamilton .

"Steven Gerrard has described it as the 'toughest decision of my life' after announcing he will leave Liverpool. Outgoing Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has 'been a hero to this generation' and is no less of a player because he never won a league title, according to Reds legend Kenny Dalglish. Gerrard announced his decision to leave his boyhood club at the end of the season late on New Year's Day following their 2-2 draw at home to Leicester City. The 34-year-old's decision ends a glittering 17-year professional career at Anfield, in which the midfielder has scored 180 goals in 695 appearances to date. VIDEO Scroll down to see Steven Gerrard's career highlights . Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard announced that he will leave the club at the end of the season . Gerrard revealed his decision late on Thursday night after scoring twice in their 2-2 draw against Leicester . Premier League: 494 appearances, 116 goals . FA Cup: 39 appearances, 13 goals . League Cup: 28 appearances, 9 goals . Champions League: 87 appearances, 30 goals . UEFA Cup/Europa League: 42 appearances, 11 goals . Other: 5 appearances, 1 goal . TOTAL: 695 appearances, 180 goals . Liverpool's iconic No 8 has won nine major trophies during his time on Merseyside - including the club's unforgettable Champions League triumph against AC Milan in 2005. Despite his impressive list of honours, Gerrard has never won the Premier League - a fact detractors look to point out when comparing the midfielder to other Kop heroes and greats of his generation. Former Liverpool player and manager Dalglish though, who won 19 major trophies in two separate spells with the Reds, believes that notion is a myth because every top player in the history of the game has failed to win something in their careers. Writing in his column for the Mirror, the 63-year-old wrote: 'Everybody who has ever played football at the top level has failed to win everything they wanted to win. Me? Well we could have won three Doubles at Liverpool in my time as a player. But we didn’t. 'There’s always something you feel you have missed out on. There’s always something that people can throw at you. You know what that’s called? It’s called sport. Liverpool legend Kenny Dalglish (right) believes  Gerrard is a club hero, despite never winning the league . 'In time, you come to understand that the most important thing is the trophies you have won. You are defined by them, not by the trophies you didn’t win. And Steven won the Champions League. 'He lifted his team to the most prestigious title in the game. He led the club in that astonishing victory in Istanbul in 2005. 'At that stadium on the outskirts of the city, he wrote his name even larger in the history of his club.' Gerrard kisses the Champions League trophy after captaining the Reds to glory against AC Milan in 2005 . Gerrard's achievements for the five-time European champions undoubtedly make him of one of the greatest-ever players to play for Liverpool. Dalglish though, who is another to fall into that category, believes that it is impossible to determine if he is the greatest-ever at the club; due to the fact that it is hard to compare and contrast players from different eras. 'When Billy Liddell was in his pomp after the Second World War, everybody said he was the greatest. They called Liverpool ‘Liddellpool’ in his honour. Everyone has their favourites and Steven has been a hero to this generation,' he added.

His mother Lanette Weeks is immensely proud of her son who decided to take up the instrument after watching his three able-bodied brothers play. 'He said: 'I want to play too' but the teachers were hesitant to teach him,' she explained. 'But then we found a teacher who used to be a concert pianist who became paralyzed in one arm and could only use two fingers on one hand.

'Liverpool Football Club has been such a huge part of all our lives for so long and saying goodbye is going to be difficult, but I feel it's something that's in the best interests of all involved, including my family and the club itself. 'I'm going to carry on playing and although I can't confirm at this stage where that will be, I can say it will be somewhere that means I won't be playing for a competing club and will not therefore be lining up against Liverpool - that is something I could never contemplate. 'My decision is completely based on my wish to experience something different in my career and life and I also want to make sure that I have no regrets when my playing career is eventually over. 'I can't thank Brendan, the owners and everyone at the club enough for how they've handled this and I am leaving on great terms. Also, I would like to thank my team-mates and all the staff for their help and continued support. 'It is a very special place to be part of. It is my sincere hope and wish that one day I can return to serve Liverpool again, in whatever capacity best helps the club.

"Scarlets lock Jake Ball has become the sixth player to sign a national dual contract with the Welsh Rugby Union and his regional team. Ball joins Wales captain Sam Warburton, Dan Lydiate, Rhodri Jones, Hallam Amos and Tyler Morgan in putting pen to paper, the WRU and Welsh regions announced. Ball, 23, has won eight caps after making his Test debut during last season's RBS 6 Nations Championship.

National dual contracts were forged as part of the Rugby Services Agreement between the WRU and Wales' four professional regions - Scarlets, Ospreys, Cardiff Blues and Newport Gwent Dragons. They are 60 per cent funded by the WRU and 40 per cent by regions from a total £3.3million pot. Ball said: 'I am delighted to have signed a national dual contract and to be staying in Wales. 'The NDC was a big factor in my decision, as I get to work hand in hand with the management at the Welsh Rugby Union as well as the Scarlets. 'Player welfare is extremely important, and being looked after by both parties is great for me.

"Sportsmail's former Premier League ref says there is no campaign against Chelsea . At Chelsea’s training ground on Friday lunchtime there was an empty space in the area usually reserved for Jose Mourinho’s sponsored Jaguar. Instead his assistant first team coach Steve Holland was the back seat driver after Chelsea’s manager pulled out of his pre-match briefing because he is upset with the FA over his latest misconduct charge. Holland proved more than capable, occasionally steering towards controversy with some strident views on ‘the campaign’, the mood around the Chelsea camp and the delicate issue of Frank Lampard. This, even by Chelsea’s standards, was spiky stuff. Chelsea players go through their stretches as Jose Mourinho jokes around with his team during training on Friday . Mourinho was seen looking happy at Chelsea's Cobham training ground but he sent Steve Holland to the pre-match press conference .

Mourinho (right) looks on in training as Chelsea prepare to host Newcastle at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . ‘There is a frustration among all of us, not just Jose, because of an accumulation of events which surfaced at the Southampton game with Cesc Fabregas,’ Holland said in the minutes after he finished off the final training session ahead of today’s clash with Newcastle. ‘With Cesc, if they don’t want to give a pen, that’s a mistake, but to book him really compounds that pain. ‘First you’re saying it’s cheating and second he misses a game at some point. Bookings can’t be rescinded. That was a really painful day for us, hence the strength of feeling in the group. ‘We don’t really do draws. The objective is to win and if we don’t then the mood is always different. ‘People don’t walk around laughing or joking. The mood is up and down depending on the result.’ Safe to say, then, that the Grizzly Bear is in a bad place after the FA rapped his knuckles because of his demand for strong refereeing at Stoke City and subsequently charged him for his comments directed at Anthony Taylor after the Southampton game.

Fabregas looks on as Andre Schurrle (left) and Didier Drogba (right) attempt to play the ball during a training drill . Mourinho took Friday training but skipped his pre-match press conference following his misconduct charge by the FA . Assistant Holland instead addressed the media where he backed Mourinho's claim in that there is a campaign against the Blues . In the absence of Mourinho, it was left to Holland to move the subject on to Eden Hazard and some of the more enthusiastic challenges carried out by defenders in the Barclays Premier League. There are, in support of Holland’s argument, various pictures of Hazard’s socks being cut to ribbons in recent weeks. Chelsea’s assistant head coach added: ‘With the diving thing, the technology is so good now and you can watch it back five times to highlight someone being in the air a bit longer than he should have done. But look at Hazard at Stoke. If he doesn’t see that coming and doesn’t get his studs off the ground, that challenge finishes his career. ‘If players anticipate challenges they try to get their feet off the ground. That makes it a very difficult job for referees. ‘But Hazard just gets on with it. He’s incredible with the stick he takes. That is part of it — if he’s a model pro and gets up straight away after being whacked, that could discourage a referee from taking action against a player who is trying to take him out of the game. Five minutes later he gets whacked again because the player hasn’t got a yellow card. It’s all part of what a player thinks is right or wrong. Cesc Fabregas goes down in the penalty area after a challenge by Southampton youngster Matt Targett . The Chelsea midfielder reacts as referee Anthony Taylor shows him a yellow card during the match at St Mary's . ‘Filipe Luis was on the receiving end of a tackle (by Tom Huddlestone) against Hull on the halfway line. Those two tackles were career-ending tackles if they connect, no doubt. Yet we spend two or three days talking about how long a player has spent in the air rather than what is done about the perpetrators of those challenges. Where’s the logic in that? ‘If nothing’s done, players like Hazard will not be able to show supporters the ability that he undoubtedly has. Eden is a very honest, top guy, that’s for sure. I’m sure he’s learning to protect himself because you can’t rely on anybody else to do it. You have to do it yourself.’ He was also willing to expand on the complex issue surrounding Lampard after the clumsy handling of his aborted move to New York City. Mourinho always dodges this one, but Holland was happy to put forward his own ideas on the issue. He said: ‘What has occurred now wasn’t the original plan, that’s clear.’ Filipe Luis (left), Willian and Fabregas speak to referee Taylor at the end of the Premier League encounter . Mourinho (right) was clearly annoyed and spoke to his support staff after Fabregas was booked for diving against the Saints . Some Chelsea supporters are disgruntled over the situation, and Holland added: ‘I think that would depend from fan to fan, but Frank is entitled to make the decision that is best for him and supporters are free to feel the way they do. Frank was a fantastic player for Chelsea, who will be revered by supporters forever. Now he is a City player, a club we are directly challenging with. Whatever has happened, that’s the situation. ‘He’s scoring goals and I am not surprised by that because he has always had that ability. It’s a difficult situation. ‘By leaving, it’s activated a part of him that perhaps wouldn’t have been activated if he’d stayed here.’","Jose Mourinho said he was taking a vow of silence after landing an FA charge over 'campaign' comments .

"Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard has confirmed that he will walk away from Anfield at the end of the season when his contract expires. We have asked Liverpool fan Donovan Chandler of 90min.com for his take on the situation. How will the team cope without Gerrard's influence? And how hard will it be to see him leave the club he is synonymous with? That old chestnut of 'all good things must come to an end' has never held more weight than it does today as a fan of Liverpool Football Club. Our captain, ​our inspiration, one of our greatest ever players - the legendary Steven Gerrard - has announced that he will leave Anfield at the end of the season. It was a choice not exactly out of leftfield. However, even with a certain air of inevitability surrounding the decision, it still comes as an almighty shock. Steven Gerrard will leave Liverpool when his contract expires at the end of the season . Gerrard should make over 700 first-team games for Liverpool by the time his final game arrives in May . Gerrard has had to face prospects of an increased role on the substitutes bench at Liverpool . Gerrard's 25-year association with the Reds will end after our final game of the season in May - by which time he'll have notched up over 700 first-team appearances - and even then it won't be any easier to watch our local boy ride off into the sunset (the sunset of the big city of Los Angeles, most likely). Gerrard's exit appears as amicable as we could have possibly wished for and he's even stated he would like to return one day. Manager material he most certainly is. His departure though, comes at the right time. And that's from both the club's and the player's points of view. Despite the loyalties, the love and the memories, Gerrard's standing in the Liverpool ranks has started to make him more of a hindrance than a help to manager Brendan Rodgers. Looking in from the outside, we can only guess just how much influence such an experienced leader has on the club's dressing room. As supporters, we can't fathom how much having Stevie around helps our group of youngsters, but people move on. It is now time for this group of lads to take responsibility themselves. Gerrard's most famous moment as a Liverpool player came when he lifted the Champions League in 2005 . Gerrard scored Liverpool's first goal as they came back from 3-0 down to win on penalties against AC Milan . Jordan Henderson (left) is set to take over from Gerrard as captain after he leaves the club . His presence will be missed on the field too, but think about that for a second. Gerrard is not as dynamic as he once was - far from it - and while he has modified his own game, his qualities make him something of a square peg in a round hole at Anfield. Rodgers wants to get back to the high energy, in-your-face philosophy of last season, typified by the hunger and the youthful exuberance of the likes of Raheem Sterling, Daniel Sturridge and Jordan Henderson. And while he would have offered that energy in his heyday, it's just not Gerrard's forte anymore. Gerrard's style struggles to fit the high intensity play of Daniel Sturridge (left) and Raheem Sterling (right) Gerrard celebrates scoring a free kick for Liverpool against Everton at Anfield earlier this season . Gerrard has lifted the FA Cup twice, including victory in 2006 where he started a comeback against West Ham . Gerrard celebrates with supporters after wining the Champions League final against Milan in 2005 . His style counteracts the philosophy Rodgers is trying to establish. Come next season, Liverpool will be better served not having to accommodate anybody - even our famed number 8. It's time for head over heart. So cherish the final few months of his stay. As Gerrard's 12-year-stint as club captain dwindles down, we can hope for more unbelievable memories, but rest assured that this man has given Liverpool plenty of those down the years. That Premier League crown may have eluded him, but from the summer it will be a time to look forward. The next generation are ready and waiting.

"Manchester City have admitted that they misled their supporters and those of feeder club New York City FC over Frank Lampard's contract last summer. The Barclays Premier League champions have alienated thousands of the fans they were trying to woo in America by keeping Lampard in England rather than sending him to New York for the start of the MLS season in March. Now senior sources at City have revealed that they made 'mistakes' when initially announcing the terms of Lampard's arrangement at New York last summer. Manchester City have admitted that they have misled fans and New York City over Frank Lampard . Lampard signed for New York City last summer before agreeing a loan move to Manchester City . PL apps: 3 (12 as sub) Goals: 5 . FA Cup: 1 Goals: 0 . League Cup: 1 Goals: 2 . Champions League: 1 (1) Goals: 0 . TOTAL APPS: 6 (13) TOTAL GOALS: 7 . Initially the NYFC website announced last July that Lampard had signed a two-year deal to take effect from August 1, 2014 while City's own website declared that the former Chelsea midfielder would join them 'on loan' until December 31. That was repeated in a tweet sent from City's official account on August 6. Subsequently, however, that has proved not to be the case with City now revealing that Lampard never became a NYCFC player last summer and actually signed a short-term contract at the Premier League club instead. Subsequently, there was no need for a loan. It is understood that Lampard only signed the equivalent of a pre-contract agreement with NYCFC. The agreement was for him to join on January 1 but that has now been put back to July. The 36-year-old's deal due to join New York City FC on January 1 but will now go in July . A series of points released to the media on Friday by City are summarised as follows: . * The statement on the NYCFC website in July saying Lampard's two-year contract took effect from Aug 1, 2014 was a mistake. * The Initial statement on the Manchester City website that it was a loan was also an error. *.There was never a break clause in Lampard's contract dated 31 December. The short-term contract with City only ran to Dec 31 and has now been extended. * There was a 'head of terms commitment' from Lampard to join NYCFC from Jan 1, 2015. That was extended to the end of this season. * Any contract with NYCFC will now take effect from July 1, 2015. The midfielder (right) released a statement on his Facebook page on Friday denying that he misled MLS fans . The saga is hugely embarrassing for City, who pride themselves on being a club that does things the right way. Equally, the situation was not helped by a peculiar statement released by Lampard himself. In attempting to clarify matters, Lampard's declaration only served to point out that he had never signed for NYCFC as initially claimed. The 36-year-old said: 'I want to make it completely clear about my situation as I have read a lot of lies and nonsense over the last few days. 'When released from Chelsea last year at the end of my contract I signed a commitment to play for NYCFC for two years starting January 1, 2015. I was then offered the chance to train and be part of the Man City squad in the interim to keep myself in the best shape going into New York. 'This period has since been extended by Man City and I will now start playing for NYCFC at the end of this current Premier League season. 'There has always been a constant dialogue between all parties in this time to find the best solution for everyone. I can say that I am very excited about arriving in New York and giving everything to the team to make us a success in the MLS as soon as possible. 'Thanks everyone for your ongoing support and I wish everyone a healthy and happy 2015!'

"Former Brighton and Watford coach Oscar Garcia has turned down the chance to become Barcelona’s new sporting director because he wants to manage again in England. Garcia spoke with Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu this week about the possibility of replacing Andoni Zubizarreta who was sacked on Monday but the 41-year-old was not convinced the move is right for him because he wants to get back on the training ground after so nearly taking Brighton to the Premier league in 2013. As a former Barca players and youth team coach who led the under-19 team to an unprecedented treble in 2011 Barcelona fans want him brought back into the fold at the Nou Camp. Former Watford manager Oscar Garcia has turned down the opportunity presented by Barcelona . Andoni Zubizarreta, pictured at Barcelona's training session on Monday, has been sacked as sporting director . But his desire to go on coaching means he has passed on the opportunity to replace Zubizarreta. After his successful spell at Barca and time spent working with Johan Cruyff as coach of the Catalan national side Garcia moved to Maccabi Tel Aviv and lead them to their first league title in 2010. He then moved to Brighton and after replacing Gus Poyet as manager in 2013 he led the team to the play-offs. Barcelona have also looked at former stand in coach Jordi Roura and Fiorentina’s Eduardo Macia as possible replacements for Zubizarreta. Macia is a former Liverpool scout who has also worked at Valencia and Olympiacos and was responsible for signing Micah Richards in the summer. Roura stood in for the late Tito Vilanova when he could no continue as first team coach because of his illness. Barca could even delay the appointment of a new sporting director indefinitely now that elections have been called for the end of the season. They are banned from signing new players in 2015 and each presidential candidate will have his own prospective sporting Director when he stands for office in June.

"Vincent Tan has revealed his mother was behind his reason to go back on the controversial rebranding of Cardiff City, a step that will go some way to repairing the enormous rift between the club and its fans. The U-turn means Cardiff will return to a blue kit on Saturday when they host Fulham, ending the unpopular two-and-a-half-year stretch of playing in red. In that time, Tan frequently refused to switch back, even hinting he might leave the club in the face of protests. But with attendances falling and unrest growing, a meeting was called on Thursday between supporter groups and the club in which it was unanimously agreed the team should revert to blue. Cardiff City owner Vincent Tan controversially changed the club colours from blue to red in 2012 . Dalman (second right) and Choo (right) pose with fans after announcing they are to switch back to blue . Cardiff City chairman Mehmet Dalman (centre) and chief executive Ken Choo at the announcement . Tan rubber-stamped the change during Friday's board meeting, saying: ‘The Christmas and New Year period has given me time to reflect on the events of the last year. ‘My mother, Madam Low Siew Beng, a devout Buddhist, spoke to me on the importance of togetherness, unity and happiness. Cardiff City is important to me and I wish to see it united and happy. ‘I asked my chairman, Mehmet Dalman and CEO, Ken Choo, for their advice and to consult with a good cross-section of the fan base. ‘I am informed that this was a very productive and frank exchange of views, but all with the same objectives to strengthen our club.’ The Christmas and New Year period has given me time to reflect on the events of the last year. Spending time with my family had a profound effect upon me. My mother, Madam Low Siew Beng, a devout Buddhist, who attended Cardiff City Football Club to watch them play, spoke to me on the importance of togetherness, unity and happiness. Cardiff City Football Club is important to me and I wish to see it united and happy. With the guidance, blessing and influence of my mother, I asked my Chairman, Mehmet Dalman and Chief Executive Officer, Ken Choo for their advice and to consult with a good cross-section of the fan base.This meeting took place last night, when some seventy representatives of our supporters were present. My thanks and gratitude to those who gave up their evening and time to be there. I am informed that this was a very productive and frank exchange of views, but all with the same objective to strengthen our Club. These views were also added to by a large number of emails that were sent to the Club over the last 24 hours from our wider supporter base. To paraphrase John F. Kennedy, 'Let us never compromise out of fear. But let us never fear to compromise.' My wish is to unite and make the Club successful and in order to achieve this I fully support the Board’s decision to implement the following changes: . 1. Starting from Saturday, 10 January 2015 and until the end of this season, our home kit shall be Blue. Our Away Kit shall be Red. I would like to thank the Football League for their approval to facilitate my request. 2. For the 2015/16 season, Cardiff City’s home kit colour shall be Blue. Our Away Kit colour shall be Red. 3. The Club badge will be redesigned to reflect the dominance of the Bluebird, while celebrating the proud history and heritage of the Club. I also wish to incorporate elements representative of my culture and beliefs, which I hope are respected. 4. As the Chairman has explained, the debt to equity resolution is not straightforward. We will deal with this in due course, with all decisions made in the best interest of the Club. 5. For the 2015/16 Season, Non Price Freeze Season Tickets will be reduced and Price Freeze Season Tickets shall be adjusted accordingly to match these prices.I very much hope these steps will bring unity, success and happiness to our Club. The challenge ahead for us is enormous and I truly believe we will overcome these obstacles as a united Club. I believe with divine blessings, Cardiff City Football Club will achieve great success.

"Robert Sarver has upped his Rangers takeover bid to £20million and offered the crisis-hit club a £6.5m emergency loan to help keep it afloat in the meantime. The US financier had an £18m offer rejected on Tuesday despite the Ibrox board announcing it was dangerously short on cash. Now the owner of NBA side the Phoenix Suns says he is willing to provide cash to pay off loans already taken out in recent weeks if the club accepts his new revised offer. Phoenix Suns owner and financier Robert Sarver has increased his Rangers takeover bid to £20million . Sarver failed in his bid to buy a controlling stake of the Ibrox club after offering £18m . He also hinted he would be willing to continue working with former oldco director Dave King and the Three Bears - wealthy fans Douglas Park, George Letham and George Taylor - who have both bought significant stakes in the past week. In a statement given to the Stock Exchange, the 53-year-old Sarver said: 'This revised proposal hopefully helps the board deal with its short-term cashflow crunch and also addresses my desire to see the club on a solid long-term financial footing. 'It would also enable Rangers to repay the loans from Mike Ashley and Sandy Easdale, and free it of debt. Sarver also offers a £6.5m emergency loan to the cash-strapped club to pay off debts in the short term . 'I know, of course, that there are various groups of prominent fans who have been working hard for a long time to bring change to the club and they can rest assured that, if my proposal is accepted, I am committed to building a strong partnership with fans and key stakeholders to do what is best for the club. 'I look forward to receiving the response of the Rangers board.' Sarver wants to buy a majority shareholding in the club, who require £8.3million by April 1 to stay in business, by way of new shares and will then make a bid to buy out the remaining shareholders at 20p a share. Sarver says the cash loan 'addresses my desire to see the club on a solid long-term financial footing' The CEO of the USD 10 billion Western Alliance Bancorporation has already provided proof of funds to the club, although their stock exchange statement notes that 'there can be no certainty that any offer will be made'. However, it still remains unlikely that he will be able to get the support needed to have his bid accepted. The Rangers board voted down its own resolution nine at the last month's AGM, which would have allowed it to issue fresh shares to new investors without first offering them to existing stakeholders. Any move to issue fresh equity, therefore, requires 75 per cent shareholder approval, but, with King and the Bears now in control of around 34 per cent and determined to protect the club for the fans, that may prove too great a hurdle. The Mike Ashley factor could also remain decisive with the Newcastle United owner positioned strongly at Ibrox after placing his associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach onto the board. Rangers have yet to repay the £3million loan the Sports Direct tycoon gave the club last year while he has also tightened his grip on the club's retail division. However, Sarver insists he will provide a steady stream of cash to the club if his bid is successful. Dave King bought a 14.5 per cent share in the club this month and is keen to protect the club for the fans . In an additional statement issued by his Scottish media relations advisor, he said: 'If the board agrees to my proposal, I would provide a total of £16.4million to £20 million to be invested in the club as the board determines - £6.5m immediately and the remainder following a share issue, taking the major step necessary to restore financial stability to the club.' Sarver, who was alerted to the situation at Ibrox by former Light Blues defender Davie Robertson, added: 'I know, of course, that there are various groups of prominent fans who have been working hard for a long time to bring change to the club and they can rest assured that I am committed to building a strong partnership with fans and key stakeholders to do what is best for the club. 'I fully realise that a strong sports club needs local investment, local directors and local support to be successful. Newcastle United owner Mike Ashley is positioned strongly at the club after placing his associates Derek Llambias and Barry Leach on the board - Rangers are yet to pay back the £3m loan he gave last year . 'I've received messages of support from many Rangers fans and really appreciate their good wishes - even if sometimes I don't immediately get their Scottish sense of humour! 'After everything they have been through in recent years, I understand some are rightly cautious about a guy they've never heard of wanting to get involved in their club. I'd feel exactly the same way. 'But hopefully I can combine my financial resources and knowledge of professional sport with strong local leaders and top-notch management to bring Rangers back to elite level.' Meanwhile, Rangers have also confirmed they have repaid the £500,000 loan issued by Easdale on Monday after Brentford paid the first instalment on their £850,000 purchase of midfielder Lewis Macleod.","Rangers board turned down Robert Sarver's £18m takeover bid .

"Former Tottenham and Chelsea manager Andre Villas-Boas believes Cristiano Ronaldo's ambition is unfairly mistaken for arrogance, and the Real Madrid forward should now be considered as the world's best player - ahead of Lionel Messi. Ronaldo is in line to win the Fifa Ballon d'Or this coming Monday after another scintillating year for club and country - scoring 63 goals in all competitions. The 30-year-old is up against Messi and Bayern Munich goalkeeper Manuel Neuer for the best player of 2014 award. Zenit boss Andre Villas-Boas feels Cristiano Ronaldo's lofty ambition is misunderstood for arrogance . Ronaldo will be hoping for more success in 2015 after another brilliant year for him in 2014 . And Villas-Boas - who now manages Zenit St Petersburg - believes Ronaldo deserves all the success that comes his way, after in his words incorrectly being labelled as 'arrogant' in the past. He told Laures: 'I think sometimes drive and ambition of individuals should not be confused as arrogance, and sometimes Cristiano gets that tag on him. 'He is a bit 'chased' publicly in some way and I do not understand why, but I think this kind of phenomenon happens to him. 'Cristiano does not get that margin of respect that sometimes Messi does, but you know hopefully this determination and passion has shown that for this time round he deserves to win it.' Villas-Boas now believes Barcelona star Lionel Messi is second behind Ronaldo as the world's best player . Ronaldo's agent hashinted the Madrid star could follow in Steven Gerrard's footsteps and move to the MLS . In Villas-Boas' mind there is no doubt who he now regards more highly as a player, after previously favouring Ronaldo's compatriot and Barcelona No 10 Messi. He added: 'In the past I have been in favour of Messi, but the drive, the ambition and the performances of Cristiano recently exceed limits. 'We are speaking about two of the greatest players in the history of the game. 'What I would say is that in this generation they are both incredible. I think Cristiano this year 2014 and also going back to 2013 has been amazing.'","Cristiano Ronaldo is in line to win the Ballon d'Or next Monday ahead of Lionel Messi and Manuel Neuer .

"If there is anywhere in Spanish football where faith alone can move mountains it's at Atletico Madrid. And when Real Madrid take on their city neighbours in the last 16 of the Copa del Rey they will face a club riding a wave of Fernando Torres euphoria, convinced he can roll back the years on a dramatic home debut. They know deep down that four years have passed since Torres was at anywhere near his best and in the long run he is likely to be the club's first reserve behind Mario Mandzukic. But with the Croatian striker rested and the 30-year Spain international they are still calling 'The Kid' not looking all that different to the boy wonder that left them in 2007, they are backing him to help them roll over Real for a third time this season. Fernando Torres will make his second debut for Atletico Madrid against Real Madrid in the Copa del Rey . Torres trains with his new team-mates and will hope to make an impression during his second spell . Torres was unveiled in front of 45,000 fans at the Vicente Calderon stadium in Madrid at the weekend . Torres has returned to the club following a disappointing spell in Serie A with AC Milan . Atletico Madrid: Oblak; Gamez, Godin, Gimenez, Juanfran; Raul Garcia, Mario Suarez, Gabi, Saul; Torres, Griezmann . Real Madrid: Navas; Carvajal, Pepe, Varane, Marcelo; Khedira, Kroos, James; Bale, Benzema, Ronaldo . Atletico have already beaten Real Madrid in the Spanish Super Cup and in the league and Diego Simeone has thrust Torres straight into his starting line-up knowing that leaving him on the bench might have broken the momentum built up around his arrival. 'If he didn't think he was ready I wouldn't put him in,' he said, suggesting that Torres will give Atletico back the option of that long pass over the top of a defence that they have lost since the departure of Diego Costa. Torres spent seven years with Atletico before leaving to join Liverpool in the Premier League in 2007 . Torres scored 91 goals for the club and became a fans' favourite before leaving for England . Torres struggled to make an impression at AC Milan after joining them on loan from Chelsea . Torres does have 10 Serie A games under his belt this season but he only scored once for Milan and they were as happy to let him leave as Chelsea were. None of that is bothering Simeone who has seen how his arrival has lifted everyone at the club. Over 2,000 No 19 replica shirts were sold on Sunday when 45,000 people packed into the Calderon to see him run back out on to the pitch where he made his debut while Simeone was still an Atletico player. The Argentine coach said: 'I have good memories of him. When we were both players we got on very well. So much happened to him at a very young age, now he is 30 but he still has the desire and the enthusiasm.' Those at the club slightly distanced from the euphoria see Torres serving an important purpose even if he doesn't hit the highs of his first period at the Calderon. In last season's Champions League final against Real Madrid, Atletico played an unfit Diego Costa and paid the price when he hobbled off no sooner had the game started. Cristiano Ronaldo will feature against Atletico as the city rivals bid to progress in the Copa del Rey . Gareth Bale will also feature as Real Madrid  look to bounce back from their defeat by Valencia . That left them a substitute short in extra-time when they ran out of energy and were well beaten by Real. Torres gives them experience and goals – although he has only ever scored twice against the old enemy and one of those goals came when he was  at Liverpool. Real Madrid coach Carlo Ancelotti has only got the better of Simeone three times in eight meetings since arriving in Spain and will stick with his tried and trusted BBC front three of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite criticism of Bale after Sunday's defeat to Valencia when he failed to play in a team-mate and ended up missing the perfect chance to score. Sami Khedira looks set to be drafted into midfield to strengthen a side that broke a run of 22 straight wins with that reverse at Mestalla. There is no Sergio Ramos so Pepe and Raphael Varane will be waiting for Torres. Atletico's prodigal son is back. The club's famed fitness coach Oscar Ortega has not had long to work with Torres but has already drilled him on the runs his team-mates will be expecting from him tonight. All that remains is to test the nostalgia against the reality. 'He has not come as the saviour,' said Simeone when he signed. That maybe true in the long run but tonight, Atletico expects.","Fernando Torres will start for Atletico against Real in the Copa del Rey .

"Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has opened the door to his players smoking the occasional cigarette by insisting it does not have an adverse effect on performance. Arsenal goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny has been reprimanded after being caught smoking in the showers following the Gunners’ 2-0 defeat to Southampton at St Mary’s on New Year’s Day. The Poland international has been left sweating on his place for Sunday’s clash against Stoke after Wenger refused to guarantee his presence in the starting XI. Arsene Wenger on Friday insisted that his goalkeeper is not guaranteed to start against Stoke onSunday . Wojciech Szczesny apologised to boss Wenger following smoking incident after Southampton loss . Colombia international David Ospina will replace Szczesny, whose position as No 1 was already under threat prior to the smoking incident, should Wenger decide to axe the 24-year-old. It is not the first time an Arsenal player has been caught in a smoking-related storm. William Gallas and Jack Wilshere have both been publicly criticised by Wenger for smoking in public. But the Arsenal manager seems relaxed about members of his squad having the odd cigarette, saying: ‘Does the occasional cigarette affect performance? No. ‘If you make a good pass on the football pitch that is what people want to see. ‘I’m sure there are some top sportsmen who smoke, but it is not a good example. The best is you don’t smoke.’ Wenger smoking in the dugout during his days as manager of Monaco . Wenger revealed he grew up in a time of military service and was paid in cigarettes . Commenting on whether Szczesny or Ospina will start at the Emirates Stadium on Sunday, Wenger added: ‘I have not selected the starting 11 yet. Will I take the (Szczesny) incident into account? I take everything into account. ‘I don’t want to talk about it because what happens in our dressing room stays in our dressing room. Every club has its internal discipline and rules. It doesn’t necessarily need to be public. ‘Ideally you want everybody to behave in the perfect way. I like Wojciech as a person, when he makes a mistake he stands up for it. He’s a guy who learns from his mistakes. ‘He has apologised. He made a mistake. He is not the first one and not the last one.’ Wenger speaks from a position of knowledge having been a smoker himself in his younger days. A video of the Frenchman puffing on a cigarette while on the bench as Monaco coach has gone viral this week amid the controversy surrounding his keeper. ‘The other day I was on French television and they showed me on the bench smoking a cigarette. I didn’t even think it was me,’ said Wenger. Mesut Ozil has been back in training for Arsenal ahead of their home game against Stoke City . ‘At that time, I remember Marcello Lippi at Juventus smoked a cigar during the whole game in every game. ‘I grew up in a pub where you did not see from here to the window because of the smoke and I spent my youth selling cigarettes. But times have changed. Society has had an evolution. In some respects in a positive way, in others a negative way. ‘One of the positives is that people don’t smoke any more. But my issue is that the players here are judged on their performances. ‘Ideally, the best way to have a high level of performance is to behave as well as possible, as close as possible to the rules that allow you to perform. ‘I am against smoking, but I have grown up in a period where I had to accomplish military service, and at the end of the month we got paid by cigarettes, so it incited us to smoke. ‘After, of course, slowly it became banned and it doesn’t exist anymore, but when I was a boy I grew up surrounded by smokers. I smoked myself when I didn’t play anymore.’ Like our Arsenal Facebook page.","Arsene Wenger leaves Wojciech Szczesny sweating on place in first team .

"Lukas Podolski came off the substitutes' bench to make his Serie A debut at the Juventus Stadium but it was new team-mate Mauro Icardi who made the difference in helping Inter Milan claim a point against Juventus. Tevez showed his former manager Roberto Mancini what he was missing by scoring an early opener against Inter however his effort was cancelled out by compatriot Icardi. Juventus forward Tevez said in the run up to his side's home match against Inter that he was not focused on going up against a side managed by Mancini.

However he must have been delighted to score  against a side coached by a manager he did not exactly see eye-to-eye with during his stint in the blue half of Manchester. Tevez scored his 16th goal of the season in the fifth minute after a fantastic piece of skill by team-mate Arturo Vidal. The Chile international tricked his way past fellow countryman Gary Medel before crossing to Tevez, who had the easy task of tapping into an empty net from close range. Another former Premier League star in Paul Pogba came close to doubling Juventus' lead when he skipped past two Inter defenders before being denied at the final hurdle by Samir Handanovic. Mancini could face more misery during the course of the next few days as Inter Milan defender Juan is likely to be punished for what appeared to be a deliberate elbow on Giorgio Chiellini. Podolski, who completed a season-long loan move to Inter from Arsenal on Monday, replaced Zdravko Kuzmanovic in the 54th minute. It was Podolski's new team-mate Icardi who got his side back on level terms with a fine piece of solo work before smashing the ball low past Gianluigi Buffon. Icardi had a golden chance to snatch the three points for his side after latching on to a cross by Podolski, however his shot went wide of Buffon's post. Dani Osvaldo nearly clashed with Icardi when the Argentine decided to shoot at goal from a tight angle, however Fredy Guarin stepped in to split his team-mates apart. Inter Milan were reduced to 10 men with four minutes to go when Mateo Kovacic was shown a straight red card for a lunging challenge on Stephan Lichtsteiner but Mancini's side held on to claim a point.

"The huge difference in wages between Premier League and Football League bosses has been revealed in a new report by the League Managers Association. The average yearly wage of a League Two manager is £50,000 - £25,000 less than bosses in the division above. But both salaries pale in comparison with the average wage in the top flight, which currently stands at a whopping £3million a year with Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho the Premier League's top earner on £8.37m-a-year. Sheffield United boss Nigel Clough (right) will earn a lot less than West Ham manager Sam Allardyce .

Unsurprisingly the most lucrative salaries in the top flight belong to those in charge of the league's biggest clubs, with Manchester United's Louis van Gaal, Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini and Liverpool chief Brendan Rodgers completing the top five. The LMA's research, which has been complied by Dr Sue Bridgewater of Liverpool University, also found that just 4.4 per cent of managers appointed since the 1992-93 season are black. Carlisle boss Keith Curle and Huddersfield manager Chris Powell are the only black managers currently employed in the Football League, while there are none in the Premier League.

"As a statue of England’s first black footballer was unveiled at St George’s Park on Thursday, it brought into focus the strides on racial inequality that have been made in our game and also the steps that still need taking. This 16ft bronze replica of Arthur Wharton stands like a lightning rod for current debates about representation at the place where new generations of football minds will come to develop. One black player in the Football League in 1889. Two black managers in the Football League in 2014; Chris Powell at Huddersfield, Keith Curle at Carlisle. More than a century of radical change has left some statistics looking static. The Arthur Wharton statue was unveiled at the St George's national football centre in Burton on Thursday . Cyrille Regis and Brendon Batson were not aware of Wharton’s story when they were playing for West Bromwich Albion in the late 70s and early 80s, subjected to racist abuse from the terraces. They did not know how he had come to Britain from Ghana, aged 19, set a world record for the 100-yard sprint and then begun playing as an amateur for Darlington. They did not know he subsequently moved to Preston North End, then signed professional forms as a goalkeeper for Rotherham and Sheffield United in the top flight. They do know, some 125 years later, that the landscape of modern coaching is imbalanced and are able to detail why the Rooney Rule is needed to provide equilibrium. Chairman of St George's Park, David Sheepshanks, cuts the ribbon to unveil the statue of Wharton . ‘The unveiling of Arthur Wharton’s statue is a really good touchstone for the contribution black footballers have made,’ said Batson, who works with the Football Association on a consultancy basis. ‘All of us have experienced racism, we know what we had to put up with. I can only imagine what he had to put up with in those days. ‘The significance is that while it has got a lot better over the years, it is still there in more subtle forms. We know the integration of black players has been phenomenal but there are still issues around inclusion. There is a parallel when you see a lack of black managers.’ This subject is live. Football League chairman Greg Clarke faced calls to resign after failing to raise the issue at the governing body’s AGM last month, but has now launched a review into under-representation. Replying to Jose Mourinho’s insistence there is ‘no racism in football’, Fifa vice-president Jeffrey Webb said racism was ‘overt’ in the English game and highlighted Chelsea youth coach Eddie Newton’s inability to get job interviews. Arthur Wharton, pictured in 1896, was the world's first black professional footballer . ‘Sometimes people want to appoint in their own image,’ said Batson. ‘But how do you know you’re getting the best candidate if you don’t widen your scope?’ The solution, as Batson, Regis and many others observe, can be found across the Atlantic. Named after Dan Rooney, who implemented the legislation in America’s NFL, the Rooney Rule would mean at least one candidate from a black and minority ethnic (BME) background is interviewed for each major football role that becomes available at a club – from manager to first-team coach to academy head. It is not, despite some beliefs, a quota designed to give an unfair leg-up. It is a mechanism intended to ensure qualified individuals are given a chance to pitch themselves in front of a selection panel or chief executive. Paul Davis, who won seven major honours during a 17-year career at Arsenal, was a coach at the club between 1996 and 2003. But he left after failing to progress from his role overseeing the Under-13s despite gaining qualifications and guiding through the likes of Ashley Cole, David Bentley and Fabrice Muamba. Dave Regis, Chris Ramsey, Shaun Campbell, Les Ferdinand, Chris Houghton and Mo Samba celebrate . Darlington fan Shaun Campbell (above) founded the Arthur Wharton Foundation to raise awareness . He joined the PFA the following year and obtained his UEFA Pro Licence in 2006, the highest grade attainable. In his role as coach educator he talks to players about pathways in the game and leads courses up to UEFA B badge standard. 'During my seven years coaching, more senior positions did become vacant at the club but although I was ambitious and dedicated to developing my career in coaching, I was never offered the chance to apply and so further opportunities never materialised for me,’ said Davis. 'There was no process, somebody was all of a sudden in another position. It was really frustrating. I was overlooked three times. ‘Unqualified people were allowed to leapfrog. I did speak to David Dein, who tried to get the final decision altered, but I was very disillusioned and took myself out of the picture. I had a lot to offer. 'There is a lot of frustration among players. I feel it when I speak to them at training grounds and a lot of this stems from bad practice and unfairness with regard to recruitment of coaches at clubs, even in cases where a player has played for a number of years and has the qualifications. There is also a general feeling amongst players that there is the perception black players aren’t interested in becoming managers and coaches. That is not the case. Once people realise that the situation may change.' St George's Park chairman David Sheepshanks talks to guests at the unveiling of the statue . The point here is that we will never see more black managers if opportunities in their early careers are checked. Around 25 per cent of professional footballers are non-white, but that figure translates to little more than two per cent in management. Broaden that to the six big football jobs at clubs – 552 in English football – and almost three per cent (16) are performed by an individual of BME background. Ugo Ehiogu, under-21s coach at Tottenham, is one. Statistics show there is an eagerness to gain coaching qualifications. Last year 45 of 238 people on PFA courses were black (19 per cent). Batson believes those numbers will grow when a clear route is mapped out. ‘You don’t invest in yourself when you think you have no chance,’ he said. Keith Curle at Carlisle is one of only two black managers in the Football League in 2014 . When Batson and Regis played alongside Laurie Cunningham, it was viewed as a bold move by West Brom to have three black players in the same team. It is quite remarkable to think that if a club, nearly 40 years later, were to appoint a black manager, black assistant and black first-team coach the response could be similar. Regis calls Wharton’s statue an ‘inspiration’ for all, no matter of colour. ‘It’ s a universal message about following your dream and having character.’ He did just that and can recall the climate in his playing days, tracing it to the modern game. ‘Managers had prejudices about black players handling the cold weather, being fancy dans, or too laid back, all those misconceptions,’ Regis said. ‘We got over that. ‘Now there seems to be misconceptions about black managers. You have to ask other people about why that is. We need to get answers from the people who make decisions.’","Arthur Wharton was signed by Darlington when he was 19 years old .

"A controversial goal helped Roma to a 1-0 win at Udinese in Serie A on Tuesday, highlighting the need for goal-line technology.

Roma moved provisionally level with leader Juventus, who are hosting Inter Milan later in the day as the Italian league returned to full action after the winter break. The win also put Roma nine points ahead of third-place Lazio ahead of Sunday's Rome derby. Udinese remained in the middle of the table, 17 points behind. Francesco Totti, Roma's 38-year-old captain, set up the goal with a free kick that Astori met in the center of the area at the Stadio Friuli. Totti was up against Antonio Di Natale in a matchup of the league's two top active career scorers. Totti is second all-time with 237 goals in 571 appearances and Di Natale is seventh on the list with 201 in 404 matches. Silvio Piola, who won the 1938 World Cup with Italy, has the record of 274 goals. Di Natale provided a perfect ball for Gabriel Silva in the 27th but the Brazilian couldn't find the target.

December 2012 - banned for two weeks after being cited for punching Ulster hooker Rory Best during a Heineken Cup match. May 2013 - sent off for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes during the Aviva Premiership final against Leicester at Twickenham. Received an 11-week suspension that sidelined him for the British and Irish Lions tour to Australia that he had been selected for. December 2014 - sent off for elbowing Leicester centre Matt Smith in the face. Banned for three weeks. * Hartley,  has now been banned for a total of 50 weeks during his playing career. And that means Hartley will be available for national selection during the 2015 Six Nations if Lancaster decides to choose him, with the tournament kicking off when England travel to Cardiff to face Wales at the Millennium Stadium on February 6. But Lancaster insists he will speak to the 61-cap hooker before allowing him to take to the field in a Red Rose shirt this year. Speaking at the unveiling of the 2015 World Cup sign on the Tyne Bridge in Newcastle upon Tyne, Lancaster said: 'I have not spoken to Dylan. I did not want to do anything until the disciplinary process was followed through, and obviously he has a ban to serve. 'He knows as much as anyone the importance of on-field discipline. He will have been disappointed in himself to put himself in that position. 'I will have a conversation with him.' In total, Hartley has now received bans totalling 50 weeks. Before his latest indiscretion, Hartley had already been given a 26-week suspension in April 2007 for eye-gouging, an eight-week ban in March 2012 for biting, a two-week punishment for punching in December 2012 and an 11-week expulsion for verbally abusing referee Wayne Barnes in the 2013 Aviva Premiership final.

"Revenge came for the Tigers yesterday and sent out an ominous warning to the rest of the Aviva Premiership — the big cats from the east Midlands are in the title hunt again. Bath had braced themselves for a ‘backlash’ after inflicting a record 45-0 humiliation on Leicester in September, but being prepared didn’t save them. At a full and freezing Welford Road, this was a hot and spicy encounter, with countless off-the-ball scuffles as the fired-up home side pounded their way to the result they craved. Leicester Tigers Graham Kitchener (left) celebrates an early try at Welford Road from Tom Youngs . Youngs powers upfield for the Leicester Tigers during the 17-8 victory over Bath on Sunday afternoon . Bath — who had England hopeful Sam Burgess playing at centre for a full 80 minutes — made a sustained response in the final quarter and should have secured at least a losing bonus point, but they were repelled by the Tigers’ defence. A last-minute try by Ross Batty gave England fly-half George Ford a conversion which would have sent the visitors home with some consolation for their efforts, but he dragged his shot wide. Soon after being annihilated at The Rec four months ago, Leicester slumped to ninth place in the table, amid a forensic inquest into the cause of the injury epidemic which was undermining their season. But gradually the cavalry have been returning and Richard Cockerill, the Tigers’ director of rugby, declared this result will serve as a statement to the rest of the league. Sam Burgess, tackled by Freddie Burns, made his first Premiership start for Bath at Welford Road . ‘It sends a bullet across the bows of everybody that we’re still in the mix and we still have the appetite to compete,’ he said. ‘It proves that we can beat the sides who have been on really good form, as clearly Bath have been. It puts us right back in the mix. ‘If we can win that game, with the quality that we’ve still got to come back into the side, it bodes well. In isolation it is a massive win for us. It’s only round 12 so there’s a long way to go but it’s certainly a building block for us. I’m relieved because we’ve put ourselves into a position to compete for the title.’ Kitchener outjumps Stuart Hooper high in the air during the home side's 17-8 win against Bath on Sunday . Cockerill attempted to play down the vengeance theme, adding: ‘We didn’t talk about that (45-0 defeat in the reverse fixture). We didn’t really want to re-visit it too much because every time we watched it, they looked so good! ‘I think it was in the back of the players’ minds but we focused on ourselves and on what we can do well. We wanted it more than they did. We defended exceptionally well and didn’t allow their back-line to create the opportunities they usually get. ‘Bath are a very physical team. The only way to meet physicality is with physicality. We felt we didn’t do that at The Rec and I think we put that right today. 'We’ve seen how good Bath are when they’re on the front foot and playing well, but it’s also about how you deal with having an off-day and coming to a side who are very motivated.’ In many ways, this was a throw-back contest; awash with mud and bad-tempered needle as two pedigree packs jostled for supremacy. England centre Kyle Eastmond had to leave the pitch injured in the first-half after suffering a bang to the calf . Having been taken apart in the previous clash between the sides, the Tigers forwards channelled their angst to deliver a performance full of driving power. They won a series of scrum penalties, although their line-out was hit and miss throughout. Ford and Owen Williams had landed a penalty apiece when Leicester claimed their solitary try in the 17th minute. It came in fitting fashion, from a close-range rolling maul in the Bath 22 which backs Miles Benjamin and Vereniki Goneva joined to help force Tom Youngs over the line. Fast-forward to the 80th minute and Batty’s try came in the same place, by the same method. Aside from those scores, both defences held firm and the Tigers relied on three more penalties by Williams. Bath had several chances to hit back in the last 20 minutes but it was a day when the bounce of the ball and the interpretation of the officials didn’t fall in their favour. Ollie Devoto of Bath is hauled down by Leicester's Tom Youngs during the Premiership clash at Welford Road . Leicester Tigers on the attack again during the 17-8 victory over Bath to move up to fifth in the Premiership . They were forced to cope without Kyle Eastmond for the majority of the game as their England centre went off after suffering a bang to the calf. Burgess featured in the visitors’ midfield and thought he had claimed his maiden first-team try in union in the 31st minute, but it was ruled out as the pass he received from Ollie Devoto was deemed to have gone forward. It was one of several close calls which went against Bath and their head coach, Mike Ford, said: ‘We were on the wrong side of the referee and we couldn’t adapt. Ross Batty scored a late try for the visitors but it wasn't enough to secure a victory on Sunday afternoon . ‘Is it because we’ve come to Leicester and the crowd are baying for our blood? ‘I’m not sure but I’m disappointed. I’m proud of the way we kept going and a bonus point was the least we deserved today. We expected the backlash and we got it, but to finish one try all at Leicester is no disgrace.’ When the dust had settled, Bath remained second in the table, with the Tigers fifth. Both clubs will be in the title shake-up at the end of the season.","Home side up to fifth in the table whereas Bath remain in second .

"A man has watched so much Olympics on TV that it blew up, killing him in a freak house fire. Fire investigators believe the man died when his TV caught alight from overheating after being left switched on or on standby too long. Perhaps it was Britain’s growing medal tally or his keen love of sport that kept Peter Horbury watching but it was a tragic and unusual end for the man who lived alone. Too much telly: Investigators believe the cause of the house fire was Peter Horbury's TV which overheated after being left on too long or on standby . The 69-year-old died from smoke inhalation after the blaze broke out in his house in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire at 6.20am today. One neighbour said Mr Horbury was a huge sports fan who was looking forward to the Olympics. The neighbour, who wished not to be named, said: ‘Peter was sports mad. The last time I spoke to him he was really looking forward to the Olympics. ‘He didn’t get any tickets, I don’t think he could afford them, but he said he was going to watch as much of it as he could on television. Blaze broke out: Mr Horbury died from smoke inhalation after his house in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire caught on fire at 6.20am today . ‘Peter used to run a pub years ago and he was into his darts and football but he loved all sports. 'The full investigation into the fire hasn’t finished yet but I imagine if it was the TV which caused it then it would be because he had watched so much of the Olympics.’ Rescue crews including 20 firefighters put out the fire and police and forensic experts were called in to investigate. Loved the Olympics: Neighbours said Mr Horbury was sports mad and with so many British medals won in the last 24 hours including men's canoe double Tim Baillie and Etienne Stott, it's no wonder the TV stayed on . Stanley West, 82, who lived next door, noticed the windows were black with smoke this morning and called emergency services. He said: ‘I went round and looked in the window and saw all the smoke. ‘The only other thing we heard was a noise at 2.40am which sounded like a table being dragged across the floor. Check your electronics: In light of the fire, the fire chief warned that all electrical items need to be switched off when not in use . ‘I don’t know him very well. He kept himself to himself, but it’s still a shock to wake up to this on your doorstep. ‘His television maybe overheated, it’s possible he had been watching a lot of Olympic coverage and maybe that that was the cause of the fire.’ Another neighbour, who wished not to be named, said Mr Horbury lived alone but was regularly visited by his sister and son. She said: ‘It’s so sad. It was crawling with firefighters on the morning he was found. ‘He was a nice bloke and a bit of a character and I used to go across occasionally and have a cup of tea with him. ‘It’s upset me. I’ve been trying to do my housework this morning but I just can’t think of anything else.’ Warning people to check electrical equipment, Deputy Chief Fire Officer John Buckley, of Nottinghamshire Police, said: ‘Our advice is to switch off all electrical items that can be turned off when they are not in use, make sure sockets are not overloaded, and check for loose wires and faulty plugs.’","Peter Horbury, 69, died of smoke inhalation at his house in Newark-on-Trent, Nottinghamshire .

"Newcastle will step up their search for a new head coach on Sunday morning after caretaker boss John Carver and his team were booed off following defeat at Leicester. Carver, who took over in temporary charge from Alan Pardew on Monday, insists he still wants the job full-time. But the fans’ reaction to Saturday’s dismal defeat will not have helped his case and it is believed Steve McClaren and Rafa Benitez are front-runners to fill the vacancy. VIDEO Scroll down to see John Carver throw his 'hat in the ring' for Toon job . Caretaker manager John Carver saw Newcastle crash out of the FA Cup third round to Leicester . Leicester striker Leonardo Ulloa scores the only goal in a 1-0 victory at The King Power Stadium . Newcastle fans are reported to have booed the team off after defeat in the FA Cup . Carver admitted he had not had any conservations with owner Mike Ashley since the departure of Pardew, who resigned to join Crystal Palace. But he said: ‘I’d be a fool if I didn’t want to be head coach of this club. Obviously results dictates that happens but I don’t feel any different. I still want to be head coach. ‘I’ve not spoken to Mike and my only communication has been with [managing director] Lee Charnley on Monday night and a short conversation last night just about the game today. ‘It will be confusing [to fans] but the only thing I will say is that the position is not now as a manager — it’s now a head coach’s job. So the head coach’s job is to get the team ready and prepared for the next game and that’s all I’ve been thinking about.’ The likelihood is that the 49-year-old will still be in charge for next Saturday’s trip to Chelsea but the manner of the FA Cup exit could accelerate the process of finding a permanent successor. McClaren, who has done an excellent job at Championship title contenders Derby, is likely to be at the top of any shortlist, alongside Benitez and former Swansea boss Michael Laudrup. Napoli manager Rafa Benitez, who has Premier League experience with Liverpool and Chelsea, is in the frame . Former England manager Steve McClaren has been working wonders with Championship side Derby . Former Swansea manager Michael Laudrup is also said to be under consideration by the Newcastle board . But McClaren on Sunday tried to distance himself from the vacancy following his team’s 1-0 win against Southport. ‘I’ve dismissed that link and I’m sticking to that,’ he said. And Derby chief executive Sam Rush issued a hands-off warning on Saturday: 'There is no question whatsoever of him leaving. 'He is one of the highest-performing managers in English football, so he is going to be linked and admired by others. But we have had no approaches.' Carver said Newcastle fans were within their rights to protest so audibly, with some also furiously gesturing for the players to go away rather than applaud. ‘It’s hugely embarrassing but they’re entitled to do that,’ he said.","Newcastle are searching for a new boss following Alan Pardew's departure .

"England’s plans to draft in Manu Tuilagi for the RBS 6 Nations have been dealt a new blow with the Leicester centre facing a delay in his recovery from injury. The 23-year-old was expected to return to club action before the new year, but Sportsmail understands his comeback has now been rescheduled for mid-January. It leaves little time for Tuilagi to prove his fitness before the Six Nations kick-off against Wales on February 6, with England head coach Stuart Lancaster expected to name his squad early next month. England centre Manu Tuilagi faces a race to be fight for the start of the RBS 6 Nations . The 23-year-old  in action for club side Leicester Tigers against Cardiff Blues in August . Speaking in the first week of December, Leicester Tigers director of rugby Richard Cockerill stressed the importance of Tuilagi to the national team’s ambitions, saying: ‘Manu has been huge for England. 'Hopefully, he will be fit and playing come Christmas time and he will be back into the England squad for the Six Nations. ‘When England have played at their best, Manu has been at his best.’ Tuilagi has been sidelined since October, when he suffered a groin injury during Leicester’s Champions Cup victory over Ulster. The East Midlands club have missed his physical presence, although Japan international Christian Loamanu could return to fill in against Bath on Sunday after starting on Monday for the club’s reserves. The delay is unwelcome news for Lancaster, who sees Tuilagi as the missing piece in England’s midfield after a below-par autumn international series. Sam Burgess looks on during Bath's match with Bath on Sunday . South Africa-born Brad Barritt kept the No 13 jersey warm during the November Tests but he offers nowhere near as much potency in attack. Tuilagi’s physicality sets him apart from his compatriots. England have tended to back sizeable midfielders including Barritt, Luther Burrell and Billy Twelvetrees over lighter options such as Jonathan Joseph, Henry Slade and Kyle Eastmond — and few come more sizable than Tuilagi. Code-switcher Sam Burgess has been seen as an outside option to bulk up England’s midfield but is unlikely to be given an international debut during the Six Nations. The Bath star is still undecided on his best position, having featured at both inside centre and back row. On Monday night Burgess started at blindside flanker for Bath’s reserves in an A League fixture against Exeter at Sandy Park. He lined up against Exeter’s England international Tom Johnson, making his first start in more than six months. Johnson had neck surgery in October and had not played since England’s 20-15 defeat by New Zealand in June. But the Chiefs forward has been in training for three weeks and could make a late charge into Lancaster’s plans. Gloucester's Greig Laidlaw kicks a penalty during his side's defeat to Bath earlier this month . He may return to Aviva Premiership action this weekend, though Exeter coaches are unlikely to rush him straight into the starting XV. The Devon club have suffered two consecutive defeats, but will be favourites when they face Gloucester at home on Saturday. Cherry and Whites scrum-half Greig Laidlaw remains optimistic, despite his side failing to gel after a summer of intensive recruitment. ‘Some boys feel the pressure but you need to go the other way, train hard, train well and improve your skill set,’ said Laidlaw. ‘I truly believe we have the players here and the coaching staff to be able to do that. ‘Sometimes it is hard to remain positive but you have to. You need to be strong-minded and back your skill set. 'That is the attitude we have to take into a tough game at Exeter. The season is not finished.’","England and Leicester centre Manu Tuilagi faces fresh injury setback .

"World Cup year has begun. Just 260 days from now, hosts England will launch the 2015 tournament against Fiji at Twickenham. The pool match is the first of 48 fixtures in an event that will break a multitude of records and potentially revolutionise the sport in these islands. Here, Sportsmail assesses the prospects of the home country, their nearest rivals, the other leading nations, and the event itself... ENGLAND . Selection: The back line is still a work in progress and midfield is the primary conundrum, as per usual. When — if ever — all the candidates are fit, it is likely to be a simple equation: Manu Tuilagi plus another, with several men jostling to claim the No 12 shirt. Luther Burrell is the form option, Sam Burgess  the possible bolter. George Ford deserves to retain the fly-half berth for now, but Owen Farrell won’t quietly settle for the role of understudy. Depth: England have a vast array of very good players, but few, if any, who would consistently belong in the world level, elite bracket. Stuart Lancaster needs his leading lights to make that leap this year, but the head coach knows he could field two Test-class packs to take on all comers. There are a multitude of pedigree English loosehead props, locks and flankers, scrum-halves and full-backs, but the coaches would like more tightheads and an out-and-out openside option. England head coach Stuart Lancaster will be hoping Manu Tuilagi is back to full fitness for the World Cup . Sam Burgess is expected to play a major role in England's quest to win the World Cup . Momentum: More needed, urgently. The national team were unable to claim the results they craved against the southern giants in the autumn, although victory over Australia at least laid down a strong marker against a pool rival. In the Six Nations, the priority will be a ‘statement’ win against another Pool A side, Wales, to bury the ghosts of the record 30-3 defeat in Cardiff two years ago. Yet, frankly, England require a title or a Grand Slam to give them a timely surge of belief and conviction. Tactics: England are still in the development phase, when they need to be fine-tuning. An expansion of the game-plan in the 2014 Six Nations brought pace and dynamism to their play, as well as heartening results, but they were unable to beat New Zealand at their own deadly game during the summer. In the recent November campaign, the vital success against Australia was founded on traditional forward force. Lancaster’s men must acquire the valuable knack of adapting on the hoof. Preparation: No stone will be left unturned. No expense will be spared. Lancaster is orchestrating a meticulous World Cup challenge based on the appliance of science and technology. England have adopted British Cycling’s ‘aggregate of marginal gains’ formula. They will spend a fortnight in Colorado in July and they now have a state-of-the-art training facility on site at their Surrey HQ. If they don’t succeed, it won’t be due to a lack of planning. WALES . Warren Gatland’s team have phenomenal potential, but not the results to mark them out as front-line World Cup contenders. Time will tell if the recent victory over South Africa will serve as a launch-pad for Welsh confidence levels. The core of the line-up is well established and armed with crucial experience from the last World Cup and a glorious Lions campaign, while the likes of Rhys Webb, Samson Lee and Liam Williams have made a positive impact. Webb and Dan Biggar appear capable of igniting a more high-tempo attacking game but Gatland must decide if it is right, at this late stage, to move away from the power-runner formula which has served him well — in Europe at least. One negative is the loss of Scarlets hooker Emyr Phillips, who will undergo surgery on a dislocated shoulder and looks set to miss Wales’ Six Nations campaign. Wales coach Warren Gatland must get his tactics right if his side are to mount a serious challenge . THE CONTENDERS . No prizes for identifying the favourites. New Zealand are top of the world rankings by a street and keep finding ways to win even when they are being emphatically out-played. They have vast experience, nous and power, supreme skills and athleticism, and the greatest finisher in the game — Julian Savea. South Africa have the size and enough quality to be a force and Australia will improve rapidly under Michael Cheika. The canny Kiwi, Joe Schmidt, has turned Ireland into Europe’s front-runners and although they have been mostly hopeless in recent years, don’t rule out a shock charge by France. New Zealand will have the greatest finisher in the game, Julian Savea, at his disposal . THE TOURNAMENT . This will be a slick event projected around the world. It will surpass all records for attendances, profits and TV ratings, but it must do more than that. Twickenham is already a victim of commercial overkill and those trying out the sport must not be submerged under a tide of logos and marketing slogans. The tournament needs to have atmosphere and soul, not a sanitised, corporate feel. It needs Tier 2 nations to have full access to all their top players and it needs a massive logistical operation to ensure transport chaos does not blight the night games in particular. Make all that happen and it will be a wondrous carnival of rugby. Twickenham will be among the 13 stadiums which will play host to the 2015 Rugby World Cup .","England will launch the World Cup in 2015 at Twickenham .

"England prop David Wilson expects to face a 'hurting' Leicester team when Bath tackle the Tigers at Welford Road on Sunday. It is just over three months since Bath inflicted a 45-0 drubbing on Leicester - their record victory in the fixture - and another win this weekend would complete a first season's league double over the Tigers since 2004. But while Bath are on a five-game unbeaten Aviva Premiership run and they will remain second in the table behind leaders Northampton whatever happens on Sunday, a Leicester triumph could lift them into the title play-off zone. The Leicester Tigers players look dejected after their 45-0 defeat against Bath back in September . Peter Stringer of Bath is mobbed by his team mates after scoring in his side's record victory against Leicester . Bath's Ollie Devoto (centre) lifts his arms in celebration as the final whistle is blown at the Recreation Ground . 'When you face Leicester at home, they are always going to be a different proposition,' said Wilson, who lines up in a Bath side that also features rugby league recruit Sam Burgess making his first Premiership start, appearing at outside centre. 'They've got a lot of players back, and the whole team will be hurting. 'I am sure the 45-0 defeat will be on their minds. That was not the Leicester anyone knows, and to beat them by that big a margin was a surprise for everyone, as much as a brilliant win for us. 'But they're getting together their power game through the pack, and they have got momentum now.' For their part, Leicester recovered from successive European and domestic losses to Toulon and Northampton by staging a thrilling fightback to pip Sale Sharks 32-30 last time out after being 15 points adrift. Bath and England prop David Wilson said that he expects to face a 'hurting' Leicester Tigers side . 'We had lost two games leading into the Sale game, so it could have been easy for us to throw in the towel and accept defeat. To win in that manner was massive for us,' Tigers number eight Jordan Crane said. 'It is going to be a tough one for us on Sunday. 'There is a bit of a bad taste in our mouths, but it is just another Premiership game. We have not really spoken about the revenge aspect. 'We owe them one, if you like, but we can't be as naive as we were down there. We probably need the points more than them at the moment.' Leicester welcome back Blaine Scully, Anthony Allen and Graham Kitchener from injury, while Burgess forges Bath's midfield partnership with Kyle Eastmond, and four changes up front see starts for Wilson, his fellow prop Paul James, lock Dave Attwood and number eight Carl Fearns. Leicester recovered from successive European and domestic losses by beating Sale Sharks 32-30 . Wasps expect a crowd of around 15,000 for their second Premiership game at Coventry's Ricoh Arena on Sunday, where victory over fellow play-off hopefuls Sale would keep them firmly in the mix. 'We will be working hard to produce an 80-minute performance on Sunday, and we know we will need to be at our best against a strong Sale side,' said Wasps rugby director Dai Young, who includes former Sale players Rob Miller, Simon McIntyre and James Gaskell in his starting XV. 'Sale are a battle-hardened team with a fantastic driving lineout and some X-factor players who can win games for them, so we know the threat they will bring. 'While we weren't happy with aspects of our performance last Sunday (against Gloucester), it was good to get the monkey off our back by getting an away win in the Premiership.' Wasps director of rugby Dai Young knows his side will need to be at their best against Sale on Sunday . London Welsh, 15 points adrift at the Premiership basement following 11 successive league defeats, continue their domestic campaign at home against Harlequins on Sunday. But despite what appears to be a hopeless position, head coach Justin Burnell insists the mood remains a positive one. 'There is nobody in our environment burying their head in the sand, and that would be quite easy to do,' he said. 'It's about rolling our sleeves up, continuing to work hard and continuing to look for that first win. 'It seems to be a given for many now that we will be relegated, but we don't see it that way. 'We are 15 points adrift and there are 11 games left, but that's not something we discuss. What we discuss is that we need to keep focusing and working hard. 'People are still upbeat, and it's still a good place to be.'","David Wilson is looking forward to facing a 'hurting' Leicester side .

"Wayne Rooney has been voted England player of the year after topping a poll of Three Lions fans. Although he failed to inspire England to success at the World Cup, 2014 was a momentous year for Rooney individually.

Rooney took 27 per cent of the votes from an online poll of supporters club members, more than second-placed Danny Welbeck (11 per cent) and third-placed Raheem Sterling (seven per cent) combined. It is the third time he has won the award. Rooney told the FA's website: 'I'm both very happy and proud to be named the England fans' player of the year. 'The fact that this award is chosen by the fans makes it even more special, so I would like to thank all those who voted. I would also like to thank all the England fans for their support throughout what was a mixed year. Arsenal striker and former team-mate of Rooney Danny Welbeck came second in the poll . Raheem Sterling, who was arguably England's best player at the World Cup in Brazil, came third in the poll .

"Three men were forcibly ejected from a cultural festival in Saudi Arabia amid concerns they were 'too handsome' for women to resist. Religious police in the conservative Islamic kingdom removed the trio, all from the United Arab Emirates, from the Jenadrivah Heritage and Culture Festival in Riyadh on Sunday.

"Clutching an AK-47 and pointing to the sky, this 13-year-old schoolboy is believed to be ISIS' youngest jihadist and has joined a 5,000-strong army of European teenagers in Syria. Younes Abaaoud, from Belgium, followed his older brother to the front line and is believed be among dozens of child-fighters in the war zone from Europe. A series of images of the schoolboy posing with various weapons came weeks after the seven-year-old son of Australian terrorist Khaled Sharrouf was pictured in Syria holding a decapitated head. Brussels-born Younes is said to have travelled to Syria with his brother Abdelhamid Abaaoud, 27, earlier this year. Scroll down for video . Is this ISIS' youngest fanatic? Younes Abaaoud, 13, from Belgium, has fled his home to fight in Syria . Belgium's media has claimed they are the sons of Omar, a Moroccan shopkeeper who moved to the European country around 40 years ago. The picture is one of several of Younes to surface online in weeks. Another image shows the youngster in a similar pose, with a gun in hand and finger pointed upwards. Younes Abaaoud's identity has been tweeted by Shiraz Maher, an academic and senior fellow at the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King’s College, London. He wrote: 'One of the youngest foreign fighters we know of Younes Abaaoud, who was 13 when he left Belgium to join ISIS.' The tweet has prompted shocked reactions from other Twitter. Photographs reportedly showing Abdelhamid, who is said to go by the alias Abou Omar Soussi, have also emerged. One was tweeted by a Belgian journalist who claimed its showed the fighter with a German militant named Abu Azzam. He also posted a picture which he said showed Abdelhamid pointing a gun while sat in a car tyre. Shocking: The schoolboy is also shown here with another gun, left, and followed his brother Abdelhamid, 27, to fight, right . The older brother, pictured, has also been used as a poster boy for ISIS to recruit more people from Belgium . Britain has among the highest number of extremists fighting for ISIS - at least 500 - but Belgium has the highest proportion based on its population. Two girls, aged 15 and 17, are under investigation in France for allegedly making plans to join jihadis in Syria. The Paris prosecutor's office said today that the girls, one from Tarbes in the south-west of the country, the other from the second city of Lyon, were placed under investigation a day earlier for criminal association in relation with a terrorist enterprise - a standard charge in terrorism cases in France. The girls are under strict judicial control, according to the prosecutor's office. It wasn't clear whether they were returned to their families. According to the French media the two girls were in contact with a third 14 year old girl, who headed for Syria last June. About 60 investigations are currently in progress in France concerning would-be jihadis or those who have left for the battlefields. Some 900 French are implicated in the phenomenon which has spread across Europe and is deeply worrisome to authorities. The Lowland country's security services said earlier this year that between 4,000 and 5,000 teenagers with EU passports may have left their home countries for Syria. ISIS has also been kidnapping Kurds and other nationalities in the warzone. In June more than 140 schoolchildren were taken and 'brainwashed' into becoming suicide bombers for Islamist militants after being kidnapped in Syria. The Kurdish pupils, aged between 14 and 16, were being held hostage in the ISIS-controlled city of Manbij, where they are being forced to take lessons in radical Islamic theology. One 15-year-old boy, known as Mohammed, said masked fighters made him watch a video of fighters beheading a man on their first day - then warned he would face the same fate if he tried to escape . Research by The International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation and Political Violence in London said that overall Western Europeans now represent up to one in five of the foreign fighter population in Syria. They say the most come from France whose Government says that at least seven of those are children and fifty are women. France is followed by Britain, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands. Adjusting for population size, the most heavily affected countries are Belgium - up to 27 foreign fighters per million, followed by Denmark, the Netherlands, Sweden, Norway, and Austria.

"Texas blues legend Johnny Winter, known for his collaborations with the likes of Jimi Hendrix and childhood hero Muddy Waters, has died at the age of 70. His representative, Carla Parisi, confirmed today that Winter died in a hotel room in Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday. There was no immediate word on the cause of death. Winter was a leading light among the white blues guitar players, including Eric Clapton and the late Stevie Ray Vaughan, who followed in the footsteps of the earlier Chicago blues masters. Johnny Winter pictured playing during the Canton Blues Festival 2009 in Ohio, he has passed away at age 70 . Winter idolized Waters — and got a chance to produce some of the blues legend's more popular albums. Rolling Stone magazine named Winter one of the top 100 guitarists of all time and he was famed for his lightening-fast blues guitar riffs and striking long white hair. His . representative's statement said his wife, family and bandmates were all . saddened by the loss of one of the world's finest guitarists. Winter had been on an extensive tour this year that recently brought him to Europe. His last performance came Saturday at the Lovely Days Festival in Wiesen, Austria. The tour, a documentary that premiered at the SXSW Festival exploring his music, youth and substance abuse battles, and a newly released four-CD set of recordings were all part of Winter's celebration of turning 70 this year. John Dawson Winter III was born on Feb. 23, 1944, in Mississippi, but was raised in Beaumont, Texas. He was the older brother of Edgar Winter, also an albino, who rose to musical fame with the Edgar Winter Group. Johnny Winter pictured singling alongside Derek Trucks at the Crossroads Guitar Festival in Chicago in 2007 . Winter was one of the most popular live acts of the early 1970s, when his signature fast blues guitar solos attracted a wide following. But his addiction problems with heroin during that decade and later battles with alcohol and prescription medication, including methadone, also drew attention. His career received a big boost early on when Rolling Stone singled him out as one of the best blues guitarists on the Texas scene. This helped secure a substantial recording contract from Columbia Records in 1969 that led to an appearance at the Woodstock Festival and gave him a wide following among college students and young blues fans. Crowds were dazzled by the speed — and volume — of his guitar playing, which had its roots in urban blues but incorporated elements of rock 'in roll. Winters paid homage to Waters on 'Tribute to Muddy', a song from his 1969 release 'The Progressive Blues Experiment.' He continued to pick up accolades, producing three Grammy Award-winning albums for Waters and recording with John Lee Hooker, which helped revive their careers. Winter performed often with blues and rock singer Janis Joplin and the two became close during the 1960s. Among the blues classics that Winter played during that era were Rollin' and Tumblin, Bad Luck and Trouble and Good Morning, Little Schoolgirl. He also teamed up with his brother Edgar for their 1976 live album Together. He was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1988. There was no immediate word on funeral services.","There was no immediate word on the cause of death .

"Forget the evidence for the Big Bang, consign memories of the most Earth-like world outside the solar system to the bin and free your mind of thoughts about  the bones of the newly-crowned world’s largest dinosaur, Titanosaur. Because these scientific accomplishments from earlier this year pale in comparison to what might be the most important piece of research of all: why dogs smell each other’s behinds. And it turns out the odd behaviour is more vital than it first appears: it gives the sniffer details on the sniffee’s sex, diet, emotional state and more thanks to complex chemical communications. Scroll down for video . A video produced by Washington DC's American Chemical Society reveals the science behind why dogs smell each other's behinds (stock image shown). It's revealed that they do this to find out information about other dogs including the gender, diet and emotional state of the dog being smelled . In a video by Reactions, it’s explained how a dog’s nose is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human nose. And when a dog smells the rear end of another, it’s actually collecting important information. The video explains how in 1975, Dr George Preti of the Monell Chemical Senses Centre in Philadelphia examined the anal secretions of dogs and wild coyotes to study this behaviour. They found that on the rear-end of the dog is an area called the anal sac, which excretes identifying chemicals to other dogs. One of the glands here is the apocrine gland, which gives the dog its natural smell. Another called the sebaceous gland also plays a part, which mostly lubricates and waterproofs the skin and hair of mammals. Dr Preti found that the primary chemical compounds that are released from these glands and produce a dog’s aroma are a variety of short-chain acids and something known as trimethylamine. For centuries, dogs have been man's best friend. But it turns out canines would drop humanity for artificial intelligence in a second if offered a treat. A study in Animal Cognition found that dogs interacted with robots similar to how they would with humans if those robots seemed 'social'. The researchers conducted their experiment by having a robot point out hidden food to a dog and measuring their reactions to the robots directions. But the dogs were better able to find the hidden food when the robot had a human face on it's monitor, and acted 'socially'. Trimethylamine is an organic compound that is a product of the decomposition of plants and animals, and is the odour often associated with rotting fish or bad breath. The aroma given off by the dog is dependent upon some of the factors mentioned earlier - diet, gender, emotional state and more. When one dog smells another, it is able to pick up on these finer details and learn information that would otherwise be mostly unavailable. But how are dogs able to pick up on these smells over some of the more powerful odours that may come from a dogs excrement? ‘You’d think the smell of dog poop would overpower Rover’s sensitive smell, but dogs have a second olfactory system in their hyper-sensitive nose called the jacobson’s organ,’ the narrator explains. This organ is designed specifically for chemical communication and not for smelling other aromas. With its own set of nerves to the brain, the organ is able to circumvent other organs in the nose used for smelling and let the dog know the chemical characteristics of the dog it is smelling. And so, as the video concludes, the reason dogs smell one another isn’t for fun but rather they are ‘getting to know each other in a special aromatic way.’ Smell ya later: Dogs aren't just smelling each other for fun; the action actually has an important purpose that gives them information about the dog they are sniffing, made possible by the fact that a dog’s nose (stock image shown) is anywhere from 10,000 to 100,000 times more sensitive than a human nose .","A video produced by Washington DC's American Chemical Society reveals the science behind why dogs smell each other .

"Stupid and insensitive: Democrat Brian Schweitzer issued a humble apology for his 'stupid and insensitive remarks' The former governor of Montana has been forced into a grovelling apology after saying House Majority Leader Eric Cantor sets off his 'gaydar' and likening the U.S. Intelligence Committee chairwoman to a prostitute. Brian Schweitzer sparked outrage over comments he made this week in a newspaper interview in which he speculated over Cantor's sexuality and railed against fellow Democrat Sen. Dianne Feinstein. But yesterday the Democrat issued a humble apology for his 'stupid and insensitive remarks' after they were published in the National Journal. 'I recently made a number of stupid and insensitive remarks to a reporter from the National Journal,' he wrote on his Facebook page. 'I am deeply sorry and sincerely apologize for my carelessness and disregard.' Schweitzer shocked colleagues and adversaries alike when he shared his perceptions of Republican Mr Cantor's sexuality following his surprising Virginia GOP loss last week to an unknown candidate. 'If you were just a regular person, you turned on the TV, and you saw Eric Cantor talking, I would say — and I'm fine with gay people, that's all right — but my gaydar is 60-70 percent,' he said. 'But he's not, I think, so I don't know. Again, I couldn't care less. I'm accepting.' He added: 'Don't hold this against me, but I'm going to blurt it out. How do I say this ... men in the South, they are a little effeminate. They just have effeminate mannerisms.' Cantor, who represents central Virginia and is outgoing House Majority Leader, has been married to his wife for 25 years and has three children. Ill-advised: In the interview, Schweitzer said House Majority Leader Eric Cantor (left) sets off his 'gaydar' after likening Intelligence Committee chairperson Dianne Feinstein (right) to a prostitute . 'I am deeply sorry': Schweitzer made the humble apology on his Facebook page . Schweitzer made the slur after a similarly ill-advised gaffe in which he compared Sen. Feinstein, the Democratic senator from California who chairs the Intelligence Committee, to a prostitute whle discussing her position on intelligence gathering. 'She was the woman who was standing under the streetlight with her dress pulled all the way up over her knees,' he said. 'And now she says, 'I'm a nun,' when it comes to this spying. I mean, maybe that's the wrong metaphor — but she was all in!' And yesterday when asked about Schweitzer's comments, Feinstein laughed and said: 'You better keep him away from my husband.' Media fury: His comments were met with widespread disapproval with Republican National Committee Reince Priebus tweeting this . She then made a hand gesture indicating that Schweitzer’s remarks were not mentally balanced, adding: 'That’s all I’m going to say.' She then stepped onto the Senate floor. His comments were met with widespread disapproval. Republican National Committee Reince Priebus tweeted: 'If a Republican said *anything* about ""gaydar"" or a senator being a ""prostitute,"" the media fury would never end.' Republican Mike Coffman added: 'What kind of sexist scumbag says something like this? Diane Feinstein has more class in her pinky than Schweitzer has in his 20 gallon hat.' Schweitzer has hinted at a desire to compete in the Democrat presidential primaries in 2016, even if Hillary Clinton runs as well. Asked on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” program in January about whether he would run for president in 2016, he said, “I haven’t decided that,” before adding, “It would ruin my life.” But he went on to tell the show's hosts that he would be a successful president, citing his record as governor of Montana. 'As governor, I spent eight years — every single year I was governor we had the largest budget surplus in the history of Montana,' Schweitzer said. 'I cut more taxes than any governor in the history of Montana, invested more new money in education. If a Democrat is good with money, you can’t beat ‘em.' He added: 'When you’ve got a Democrat like me who is good with money and Republicans have to admit it, they say, ""Oh, we don’t want to run against him again""'","Brian Schweitzer told newspaper reporter Cantor had 'effeminate qualities'

"Bad taste: Crass game Cards Against Humanity . Billed as ‘a party game for horrible people’, it is the latest craze being played at dinner parties across the land. Cards Against Humanity is a game in which players are encouraged to be as ‘despicable’ and offensive as they possibly can. Critics have slammed the US creators who admit their aim was to tarnish Britain’s most sacred institutions. The card game mocks the Royal Family, politicians and the Hillsborough disaster in which 96 Liverpool football fans died. It also insults dead reality TV star Jade Goody and missing youngster Madeleine McCann. The McCanns’ spokesman, Clarence Mitchell, said: ‘The offensiveness of this speaks for itself. For the makers of the game to make light of a missing child is beyond offensive. They should reconsider what they’re doing and all Madeleine references should be cut out of future editions. It is deeply offensive.’ In the game, one player asks a question from a black card and everyone else answers with their ‘funniest’ white card. It is the nature of the questions and answers on the cards, that make the game so controversial. Each black card is either a question, or a phrase where the key words have been left as blank. At first they might seem innocuous, such as: ‘What’s that smell?’ However, another card reads: ‘In Michael Jackson’s final moments he thought about...’ The players then respond from the selection of answers from white cards they have in their hand. These include ‘Madeleine McCann’, ‘Jade Goody’s cancerous remains’ and ‘Hillsborough’. One card reads ‘Queen Elizabeth’s immaculate a***’ and another says: ‘Leaked footage of Kate Middleton’s colonoscopy.’ Other cards include ‘Auschwitz’, ‘Kids with bum cancer’ and ‘Chunks of dead prostitute’. The person who creates the ‘funniest’ or most offensive answer wins a point. Missing Madeleine McCann is mocked in the dinner party card game . Ingrid Seward, editor of Majesty magazine, said: ‘It’s in extreme bad taste. It’s not satire, it’s very unfunny whether you’re a monarchist or not.’ Steve Rotheram, MP for Liverpool Walton and Hillsborough campaigner, said: ‘It is hard to understand the mentality of those who have produced such a disgusting and offensive game. I hope people refrain from becoming involved in such a despicable activity.’ However, the creators remain unapologetic. Eli Halpern, 27, project leader of the British version, said: ‘One card is “Queen Elizabeth’s immaculate a***”. That was our mission statement, to take the most sacred thing in the UK and tarnish it. Reality television show star Jade Goody, who died from cancer, is also a target in the 'offensive' game . ‘The British have a different humour from Americans. We sent a survey out on the internet with a list of the US cards and asked people to cross out the ones they didn’t understand. Then I had meetings in pubs to discuss the cards we should include in the British version. ‘Hillsborough seemed fair game because it was historic. When we were testing that card we never hit a raw nerve or got any complaints.’ Cards Against Humanity was invented by eight childhood friends from Chicago in 2009. Fellow inventor Ben Hantoot said: ‘We had no idea how it would take off. This was a game we made up on New Year’s Eve to entertain ourselves.’ The UK version also includes references to David Cameron and Ed Balls, J. K. Rowling, Boris Johnson and England’s dislike of ‘the bloody Welsh’. Mr Hantoot said: ‘We’ve not had to withdraw any cards. “Jade Goody’s cancerous remains” is a cringer which came up during one of our play tests and remains one of the most popular cards. ‘Madeleine McCann was the riskiest one because we don’t have anything like that in the US version. That was the untested one but people love it. Our goal is to be as funny as possible and sometimes things that are really offensive are also really funny.’ The eight inventors of the game are all now reportedly millionaires.","Cards Against Humanity is the latest outrageous dinner party craze .

"SECOND SEASON SYNDROME AT MAN CITY . The way Man City are at the minute, you have to wonder if they’ll go the same way as the last time they won the title. When Roberto Mancini won in 2012, they couldn’t replicate it the next season, struggling in the Champions League and finishing 11 points behind Man United. If that was a bad defence to their title then, if City aren’t careful, this one could be even worse. David Silva  scores for Man City against West Ham but the strike wasn't enough to see his side avoid defeat . The Defending champions managed to score but may need to show their opponents more respect in future . Man City are already six points behind Premier League leaders Chelsea after just nine fixtures . Manchester City frontman Sergio Aguero trudges off the field following his side's 2-1 defeat to West Ham . Striker Diafra Sakho celebrates scoring West Ham's winning goal against Man City with Cheikhou Kouyate . Roberto Mancini (centre) guided City to the Premier League title in 2012 but was unable to defend the crown . They are already in danger of going out of the Champions League and have four fewer points than they did at the same stage in 2012-13. You wonder if, having won the title the previous year, they don’t show enough respect to some opposition. That certainly looked the case against West Ham on Saturday. That combined with some sloppy defending and individual errors must be worrying for them. Despite that they look like the only team capable of matching Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea and after United’s late equaliser on Sunday, they got away with slipping further behind. But City have to start performing and soon because a squad as brilliant as their’s should be doing much, much better. Manchester City have trailed the Premier League leaders early on in each of their two title defence campaigns . Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini looks dejected as his side failed to win at Upton Park on Saturday . Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa lead the way... SET-PIECE SHAME AT OLD TRAFFORD . With two set piece goals at Old Trafford on Sunday, it shows you just how fine the margins can be in the big games. When Didier Drogba slammed in that header, I couldn’t believe what I was seeing. Not because he had scored, but the way United defended the corner. I don’t care if Drogba’s 36 or 46, he’s still one of the best headers we’ve seen in this league. Why on earth was Rafael marking him? Drogba is 6ft 2in. Rafael is 5ft 8in. Before the game every team has a list of who is marking who. There must have been raised eyebrows when those two were put together. Robin van Persie covered the front post but he should have been the man on Drogba. Then, without the height of Branislav Ivanovic, Chelsea concede from a set piece at the death to draw. Those are the kind of details that win and lose games. PS That’s twice now - against City and United - Chelsea have been 1-0 up, brought on Jon Obi Mikel and conceded late on. It’s not him as a player, it’s the message of the manager. Jose is a safety first boss but when you make that switch, it tells the team to sit back and defend. Unfortunately for him, it’s not working. Rafael can get nowhere near Didier Drogba as the Chelsea striker climbs highest to head Chelsea into the lead . Drogba silenced the Old Trafford crowd with his header having missed the best chance of the first half . Jose Mourinho has twice brought on John Obi Mikel (right) only for Chelsea to then conceded late on . 76% - Southampton have been rock-solid at the back this season, conceding just five goals so far - fewer than any other team in the top four tiers of English football. It’s not just the back four keeping teams at bay, though. Keeper Fraser Forster has the best saves-to-shot rate in the Premier League - higher than England colleagues Joe Hart (69%) and Ben Foster (66%). 20 - Wilfried Bony's goals against Leicester on Saturday took him level with Michu on 20 strikes for the club, making him their joint-top scorer in Premier League history. 28 - Since the beginning of the 2010-11 Premier League campaign, Leighton Baines has recorded 28 assists - 14 more than any other defender in that time. 1500 - Alexis Sanchez's second goal at Sunderland was Arsenal’s 1500th in the Premier League - they are the second team to reach the milestone after Manchester United. 4 - With seven strikes this season, top English scorer Saido Berahino has four more Premier League goals than any of his compatriots. This is a greater difference than between the top two native scorers in France (A Gignac 10, A Lacazette 8), Germany (M Gotze 6, A Meier 6), Italy (A Cassano 5, M Sau 4) and Spain (Nolito 5, A Bueno 4). 0 - Leonardo Ulloa began his Leicester career with a bang - netting five in his first five games - but he has failed to attempt a single shot in the four matches since. 2 - West Brom seem to enjoy playing against London sides - they have lost only two of their last 11 Premier League games against teams from the capital. ALEXANDRE THE GREAT . After his masterclass against Manchester City, Premier League bosses will be kicking themselves for not taking a chance on Alex Song. The strikers have stolen the show at West Ham this season, but Song has been a class act in the middle. His time at Arsenal and Barca has given him a wealth of knowledge - he is so good at drawing fouls and keeping possession to take the sting out of games. He has helped free up Mark Noble and Stewart Downing, and though he won’t get an assist in the stats, his pass to spark West Ham’s first goal was topclass, as our graphic shows. So credit to Sam Allardyce for giving him a go. It is working out perfectly. Alex Song has been a class act since joining high-flyers West Ham from Barcelona in the summer . TADIC IS LAYING THEM ON THICK . I was speaking to Ronald Koeman in the Sky studio this week about Dusan Tadic. We see Tadic producing the goods every weekend but Koeman gets to work with him every day and he was effusing about just what a fantastic player he is. Southampton has been perfect for Tadic because if he went to an Arsenal or a Man City, he might not have got in the team. At St Mary’s he has become one of the main men. He is such a clever player and he set up another at the weekend. He’s riding high in the assists charts alongside experienced Premier League stars like Cesc Fabregas and Glyfi Sigurdsson which shows just how well he has done to adapt so quickly. Dusan Tadic, pictured against Charlie Adam, has been key to Southampton's excellent start to the season . Southampton manager Ronald Koeman has been effusing about what a fantastic player wideman Tadic is . 23 - The number of shots Mario Balotelli has taken without scoring a Premier League goal - the most of any player in the division. REDS TO BUILD ON THE BACK . The only good thing you could talk about at Anfield on Saturday was Liverpool keeping a clean sheet. It was their second at home in seventh months. For a team with title aspirations, that’s just not good enough. There has been a lot of recent focus on the strikers and Mario Balotelli in particular for not scoring, but they really have to go back to basics in terms of not conceding goals. That is the foundation of any good side and once that stability is in place, maybe then Balotelli might get firing. If they are solid by the time Daniel Sturridge gets back, he will definitely start adding goals to the mix. Mario Balotelli has come in for criticism having not scored but Liverpool must go back to basics this season . BATTLING BONY KEY FOR SWANS . After covering their game against Leicester on Saturday night, I was very impressed with Swansea. They have made their best-ever start to a Premier League campaign and Gary Monk is excelling in his first full season in charge. They have some good players at that club but Wilfried Bony is a real powerhouse up front. Monk has kept the passing philosophy and Bony fits in with that, but provides strength too. He bullies defenders and he loves a shot, so it’s no surprise to see him score in his last three Premier League outings. Wilfried Bony has impressed for Swansea  this term and has scored in his last three Premier League matches .","Man City could suffer another poor defence of the Premier League title .

"To the haunting refrains of Amazing Grace, 150 strangers on Thursday attended the funeral of a seven-month-old girl who died of starvation in a basement that resembled a 'dungeon' in January. Police, firefighters and members of the public who never knew little May Edwards arrived at St. Anne Catholic Church in Barrington, Chicago, to mourn the baby and released a solitary balloon at the cemetery as she was buried. The turnout of so many was in part sparked by the shock and horror in the community after the death of Mya - after her parents allegedly allowed her to starve to death because they couldn't afford food for her. Tragic: The coffin of Mya Edwards, the 7-month-old from Barrington, Ill., who starved to death in January, rests at St. Anne Catholic Church on Thursday, July 31, 2014, in Barrington, Illinois . 'It was great for me to be able to do,' said Detective Lori Allsteadt to The Daily Herald after releasing the balloon. 'It kind of was like the release on this whole thing.' Deacon Jim Pauwels, gave a eulogy in which he asked those present not to think of their anger at the child's passing but to mourn her. 'When we're confronted with a case of innocence suffering, a case of death coming where there should have been life and growth and promise, it's not possible to not react,' Pauwels said to The Daily Herald. Touching: The ceremony and burial were organized by a non-profit organization and attended by community members and the police and fire officials who were among the first to see Mya after she died . Police, firefighters and members of the public who never knew little May Edwards arrived at St. Anne Catholic Church in Barrington, Chicago, to mourn the baby and released a solitary balloon at the cemetery as she was buried . Grief: Joaquin Edwards, uncle of 7-month-old Mya Edwards, who starved to death in January, is consoled at the grave site by the Rev. Bernie Pietrzak, from St. Anne Catholic Church . Mya's parents, Gene Edwards, 22, and Markisa Jones, 19, have pleaded not guilty to charges of involuntary manslaughter and child endangerment stemming from the girl's death after they stopped feeding her and her twin sister Mia formula. They instead gave their children meals of water, cereal and baby food, which wasn't enough to sustain the seven-month Mya. Jones and Edwards were initially arrested January 8 after paramedics called to their home found their seven month-old daughter Mya dead on the dining room table. The negligent parents called 911 that evening because the emaciated baby was not breathing, officials said. Both Mya and her twin were observed to be ‘very skinny.’ Further probing found that the pair kept both toddlers in the same crib locked in ‘an unfinished basement that resembled a dungeon,’ Assistant State’s Attorney Alyssa Grissom told the paper. Accused killers: Gene Edwards (left) and . Markisha Jones (right) have been charged with involuntary manslaughter . and felony child neglect in the starvation death of their infant . daughter Mya . Mya was found to have died of malnutrition as a result of starvation, authorities said. The couple were each charged with involuntary manslaughter, felony child endangerment and had their bails set at $250,000 a piece. At the funeral was Mya's uncle, Joaquin Edwards. He said he was 'grateful' for the service but wished his family was involved. 'I feel very pleased and at ease to know that she is buried,' Edwards said to The Daily Herald. One firefighter, Chris Alioto, played the bagpipes during the burial, giving an emotional rendition of Amazing Grace. Detective Sgt. Kevin Croke, who is leading the investigation, said the funeral was necessary. 'It's not common you get this kind of closure in this kind of case,' he said.","Mya Edwards died of starvation in January in a Chicago suburb after her parents allegedly neglected her .

"Steven Gerrard will announce on Friday that he is ending his 26-year association with Liverpool at the end of the season. The Anfield captain, who joined Liverpool when he was eight years old, is wanted by Major League Soccer’s LA Galaxy. The 34-year-old Kop idol has turned down a contract extension at Liverpool and became free to negotiate with overseas clubs from January 1. Los Angeles Galaxy hope to sign Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard when his contract expires in the summer . Gerrard applaud the fans at Anfield after Liverpool's 2-2 draw with Leicester City on New Year's Day . Gerrard has been offered a new deal by his club but has decided to leave Anfield after 26 years . Gerrard scored 13 times for Liverpool last season, coming agonisingly close to his first Premier League title . Gerrard has only ever played for Liverpool, winning the Champions League in Istanbul in 2005 . 695 games, 177 goals . 1 Champions League . 2 FA Cups . 3 League Cups . 1 UEFA Cup . 2 UEFA Super Cups . 1 Charity Shield . Gerrard has enjoyed a brilliant career at Anfield. The Premier League title has eluded him, but he inspired Liverpool to their incredible Champions League final comeback win against AC Milan in 2005. Relations between the captain and Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers have improved in recent months, but the midfielder will insist on Friday that his decision to quit is in the best interests of his career. Rodgers had suggested Gerrard would finish his career as a central defender at Anfield, but his view has changed recently. Instead, the player was warned he will no longer feature in every game and the club offered him a new package on different terms for 2015-16. LA Galaxy, who signed David Beckham in 2007, are among a number of clubs interested in signing Gerrard this summer. New York Red Bulls, who employ former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier as their sporting director, are also in the hunt. Gerrard has been an inspirational captain for more than a decade, leading the team since 2003 . The Liverpool skipper has often been the man to bail his team out on the big occasion with an important goal . Gerrard was instrumental in his side's run to the Champions League final to win their fifth European title . Gerrard insists he has made no decision about his next club but has assured Liverpool he will not join a direct rival, as Frank Lampard did when he quit Chelsea for New York City, then joined Manchester City. The Liverpool legend's availability will alert clubs across Europe, though, and he has a massive decision to make. Monday’s FA Cup third-round tie at AFC Wimbledon is the start of the long goodbye for a player who has made nearly 700 senior appearances for his only club. Gerrard has lifted 11 trophies but he will always regret missing out on the biggest domestic prize of all. The closest he came to winning the title was last season, when Liverpool finished two points behind champions Manchester City. Former Liverpool team-mate said on Twitter that it was the right decision for Gerrard to move on . Gerrard was man of the match in the 2006 FA Cup final, scoring twice to help Liverpool lift the trophy . Gerrard has won the Cup twice, adding to the eight other trophies he collected during his years at the club . Gerrard’s England career ended when they limped out of last summer’s World Cup in Brazil without winning a game, with him as captain. Shortly after, he announced his international retirement following talks with club boss Rodgers aimed at extending the Kop legend’s career. After criticism of his form earlier this season, particularly after Liverpool’s 3-1 defeat at West Ham, Gerrard hit back when he scored in the derby against Everton. He insisted he wasn’t finished but Liverpool’s exit from the Champions League in the group phase hit him hard. Now he has resolved to quit the club and look for another challenge. Since making his Liverpool debut in 1998, Gerrard has played almost 500 league games for the club . Gerrard quickly established himself as a fans' favourite and has stayed with Liverpool for 17 years . Gerrard has won three League Cups during his Liverpool career, and could still win a fourth this season . The former England captain has been rested in recent games, but returned to score twice against Leicester . Despite Gerrard's two spot-kicks Liverpool capitulated against the league's bottom side, drawing 2-2 .","Los Angeles Galaxy want to talk to Gerrard about possible move to US .

"Nine people are dead and at least 36 were wounded  - including six children - in an especially bloody 48 hours in the gang-and-violence-plagued city of Chicago over the weekend. Five of the six children wounded - who range in age from 11 to 15 - were shot during a drive-by shooting on Sunday night after a person in the vehicle reportedly asked if the children were members of a particular street gang. The sixth, a 15-year-old girl, was shot while riding in a vehicle in what appears to be a separate - but also gang-related - incident. Bloody: Five children were shot Sunday night while walking home from a playground in the city's Humboldt Park neighborhood . Bloody Sunday: Six children in Chicago were shot on Easter Sunday during a particularly bloody weekend for the Windy City . In one of the especially grisly shootings in the Windy City over the weekend, a Cook County Sheriff's Office corrections officer fatally shot his wife - a Chicago police officer - before shooting himself in what appears to be a murder-suicide. The drive-by shooting happened about 7:30 p.m. Sunday in the 6600 block of South Michigan Avenue. According to the Chicago Tribune, the children were walking home after playing in the park at a nearby elementary school when a car pulled up and someone inside asked if they were in a gang. A relative of one of the children said the children answered no before someone inside the vehicle started shooting. Relatives of another victim says the kids didn't have time to respond - before they could even answer someone in the car started shooting. Authorities found 23 shell casings at the scene where five children were shot after they were asked if they were members of a particular gang . 'I thought it was firecrackers but I saw everyone running,' witness Kimyana Bryant told NBCChicago.com. 'My mom ran over to us. I was trying to get all the kids from the park. I brought them over here so they could be in the house with us.' Investigators found 23 shell casings at the scene. Each of the children were taken to area hospitals in varying conditions, but each is expected to survive. In the case of the other 15-year-old girl who also was shot on Sunday, she was in a car driving in Chicago's Humboldt Park neighborhood heading southbound in the 1700 block of North Pulaski Road about 9:40 p.m. when the vehicle stopped at the intersection at West Wabansia Avenue. As the vehicle stopped at the intersection, three male subjects walked across the intersection and flashed gang signs. As the car drove off, one of the males started firing at the vehicle, hitting the 15-year-old girl in the back. Mayor Rahm Emanuel is trying to combat gang violence, but Chicago remains one of the most violent cities in America . The girl was taken to Saints Mary and Elizabeth Medical Center in stable condition. It's unclear whether anyone else in the vehicle was wounded. As of 5 a.m., no arrests had been made. Chicago has been plagued by violence in recent years as gangs continue to infiltrate the city. So far, 85 people have been murdered in 2014. In 2013, the city recorded 431 homicides - which was an improvement from 2012, when Chicago led the nation in homicides with more than 500.","Of the 45 people shot, nine were killed .

"In the latest instalment of his weekly column, chief sports writer Martin Samuel gives his verdict on the sporting issues of the week, saying what made him feel warm inside and what made him shiver... WHAT'S HOT . SERGIO AGUERO . Talking to Ferran Soriano, chief executive of Manchester City, on Sheikh Mansour’s brother’s yacht last weekend – just thought I’d get that one in – he advanced the probability that Chelsea’s run would be curtailed by injury at some stage this season. That Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas would miss the odd game, and this would slow them down. Leaving aside the fact that Costa did not play between October 5 and November 1, in which time Chelsea beat Crystal Palace 2-1, Maribor 6-0, drew 1-1 at Manchester United and eliminated Shrewsbury Town from the Capital One Cup, there is another flaw in that argument. Couldn’t the same be said of Sergio Aguero? And without Aguero, where would City be? Sergio Aguero was in scintillating form for Manchester City against Bayern Munich on Tuesday night . After his hat-trick against Bayern Munich, that is now 17 goals in all competitions for the Manchester City striker, a phenomenal return. To put that run into perspective, his nearest colleague has four. The rest of the team put together have 21. Costa is in outstanding form for Chelsea, too, but he has six fewer goals than Aguero in four fewer appearances. Costa is averaging a goal every 0.78 games. Impressive. Aguero is up at 0.94. He is the one that needs the cotton wool wrap. John Terry (right) and Cesc Fabregas celebrate a goal during Chelsea's 5-0 win over Schalke . EASTERN EUROPEAN FOOTBALL STADIUMS . Vasil Levski was a Bulgarian revolutionary and national hero from the 19th century. Executed by the Ottomans in 1873, his interest in football would have been negligible. He gave his name to a mean stadium, though. The pitch is rubbish, the bitter cold nobody’s friend but, oh, those floodlights. Oblong, intense, illuminating a monolithic, Soviet-influenced concrete bowl with a running track for the other sports, the minute you saw them, you knew you couldn’t be anywhere but Eastern Europe. I can remember visiting the Dinamo Stadium, Minsk, when England played in Belarus. Dinamo is a multi-sport club founded in the Soviet Union (this is why so many teams with that name have the same badge), meaning their influence goes far beyond football. In the entrance hall of Dinamo Stadium was a plaque commemorating all of the Minsk athletes that had won gold medals at the Olympic Games. It was huge and all were celebrated equally, summer and winter. And there I found it, written in Cyrillic script, but recognisable. 1972: O. Korbut. Now that’s history.

Lewis Hamilton proudly holds a Union Flag after he won the Formula One world championship last weekend . UEFA GROUP TABLES . If you have devised a system that is so complex even you can’t work it out, maybe it is time for a change. UEFA think that Manchester City are third in Group E. They’re not. They’re bottom. And this is why. The first method of differentiating between teams on the same points is to use their results, head to head. Roma, CSKA Moscow and Manchester City all have five points. But Roma have a better head-to-head record against Moscow, who are better head to head than City. City and Roma have yet to play their second game. So why are City in third place? According to UEFA, alphabetical order. They don’t use the head-to-head calculations until all games have been completed. So, from the top, it’s R for Roma, M for Manchester City, C for CSKA Moscow. These people clearly did not watch Sesame Street. But, wait, there’s more. UEFA have their official team listings in Group E as AS Roma, Manchester City and PFC CSKA Moskva. So that explains it. To be on the safe side in future, Manchester City may wish to change their name to AAAAA Manchester City. You know, like plumbers in the Yellow Pages. Manchester City are bottom of their group but know a win in Rome is likely to send them through . SOUTHAMPTON, STRANGELY .

"Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers has no concerns about Raheem Sterling's ability to handle the physical and mental pressure of being the team's attacking focal point. With striker Daniel Sturridge still at least a fortnight away from returning from a thigh injury, Sterling has occupied the centre-forward role in the last five matches. On Monday he became embroiled in a spat with Swansea City's Federico Fernandez, which resulted in both players slapping each other around the head. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Raheem Sterling (left) clashed with Swansea City's Federico Fernandez on Monday night . Liverpool boss Brendan Rodgers, at training on Tuesday, has been impressed with Sterling's temperament . The pair escaped punishment on the night and also any retrospective action, and Rodgers is confident the 20-year-old can handle the unwanted attention which comes with being the side's main striker. 'I've been so impressed with his ability to deal with pressure,' said the Reds boss. 'It was an unfortunate incident and the referee called it right. They had been niggling at each other all game but it was nothing. 'Fernandez is a good player and he gave him (Sterling) a hard time - I don't think he's had that in his time. 'I have no qualms about him dealing with those moments. He has dealt with pressure since he broke into the team aged 17. Sterling (right) has been deployed as a central striker in Daniel Sturridge's absence for the Reds . 'There will be moments in the game when the red mist may come across and of course every player has to handle that. 'He is so strong physically, he surprises a lot of people with his body strength, so he can make defenders look silly not just with his pace. 'He accepts it (physical confrontation) is part of the game and teams may want to do that, but it is important you retain that self-control and concentrate on your performance.' Since missing a number of chances at Manchester United in his first match in the position, the youngster has begun to get to grips with what the role entails. He got two against Bournemouth in the Capital One Cup and scored the only goal of the match at Burnley on Boxing Day with a carbon copy of a chance he missed at Old Trafford, and his stint as a centre-forward is not attracting as nearly as much criticism as it did a fortnight ago. Raheem Sterling will not face any action after pushing Federico Fernandez in the face . 'The thing that impressed me with Raheem is his tactical idea of the game,' added Rodgers. 'We set the team up to press and that was one of the key things for putting him in the team. 'He can play anywhere along that front line and that is the type of player I like. 'There is no doubt you need to have a player in there who scores goals but you can see that in him that he has the ability to do that.' Captain Steven Gerrard will return to the starting line-up to face struggling Leicester City at Anfield on New Year's Day. Rodgers talks to his backroom staff during the training session at Melwood in Liverpool on Tuesday . The midfielder is in the final six months of his contract and effectively could open negotiations with a foreign club now, but Rodgers remains relaxed about the situation. 'I think he has earned that respect if he does,' the Northern Irishman said. 'I have a great relationship and communication with Steven so we understand exactly the position.' Rodgers does not expect to do much business in the transfer window, preferring to try to improve the many players he signed in the summer, but has not ruled out recalling 19-year-old Jordon Ibe from an impressive loan spell at high-flying SkyBet Championship side Derby. 'I have seen a lot of Jordon's games and he has been outstanding but that is the reason why we sent him out - to get game experience,' said Rodgers.

"Random shots: New York City Police Officer Brendan Cronin, who was off duty at the time, was arrested on an assault charge on Wednesday, April 30, 2014, after police say he apparently fired his service weapon at random, wounding a suburban New York man who was shot six times while he was sitting in a car at a stoplight . Two off-duty drunk NYPD police officers were arrested on Wednesday for firing their guns at members of the public, including one who emptied 13 rounds from his handgun - hitting a man in a nearby car six times. Officer Brendan Cronin, 27, who is assigned to the 46th precinct in the Bronx, was driving in Pelham, Westchester late on Tuesday night when he fired at a total stranger, who was sitting in the passenger side of a car at traffic lights. Cronin had drunk so much beforehand that he told officers afterwards that he 'doesn't remember what happened', according to a police source. Then, three hours later, outside outside a Somerset County strip club in New Jersey, NYPD Sgt. Wanda Anthony shot at least one round at a former boyfriend and his new girlfriend. Luckily no one was struck and Anthony fled the scene in a car, but was pulled over and charged with drunk driving after the incident. Cronin has been charged with first-degree assault for the unprovoked shooting of the 47-year-old man. Pelham Police Department Chief Joseph Benefico said that Cronin emptied the clip on his 9-mm Glock handgun. 'Dangerous and bizarre,' Benefico said to CBS News. 'We have no motive as of yet.

Fiat sibling Abarth was named the industry's rising star, Honda the most reliable, Lexus the most comfortable, Subaru the most recommended and Maserati the greatest to drive — ahead of Porsche. Ford's new Mondeo is not to be sneezed at, thanks to a new advanced air filtration system aimed at helping asthmatics and hay fever suffers. The system blocks up to 99 per cent of pollen, almost all nitrogen dioxide — a key asthma trigger — plus other pollutants and odours. As a result Ford says it will help stop allergy sufferers 'driving blind' after sneezing at the wheel. At 60 mph, a driver would travel up to 20 metres unsighted. Hay fever affects more than a quarter of Europeans. Statistics show they are a third more likely to be involved in a collision. Ford says the new system, developed in Germany, employs activated charcoal, as do gas masks, respirators, and spacesuits. It claims an improvement of up to 50 per cent on previous units.

"Passport giveaway: A law introduced in 2011 has allowed an extra 550,000 non-EU residents to apply for Hungarian nationality and, with it, the right to live anywhere in Europe . A little-known loophole has enabled half a million people from some of eastern Europe’s poorest countries to obtain Hungarian citizenship and, as a consequence, a European Union passport. A law introduced in 2011 has allowed an extra 550,000 non-EU residents to apply for Hungarian nationality and, with it, the right to live anywhere in Europe – including Britain. The ‘passport giveaway’ was intended to enable people whose ancestors lived in the former Austro-Hungarian Empire to claim citizenship. But the system has also attracted applicants who admit they have little emotional attachment to Hungary and only tenuous ancestry. For some people in eastern Europe’s poverty-stricken nations, the scheme presents a chance to escape to wealthier countries such as Britain, Germany and Switzerland. Yesterday a report by Her Majesty’s Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, John Vine, said the ‘European citizenship route’ was becoming ‘an increasingly important way into the UK for those whose origins lie outside the EEA (European Economic Area)’. His report looked at more than 100 sample cases from the Home Office between April and September last year. It found that more than a third of Western European nationals applying for citizenship for their partner were born outside the EU. The Hungarian passport giveaway is just one route. In neighbouring Serbia alone, 112,000 new passports were issued between 2011 and the end of March this year. Thousands of Serbian residents are eligible for citizenship because the northern province of Vojvodina belonged to Austro-Hungary Empire until 1918 when Hungary – allied with Germany – lost the First World War and was forced to hand over two-thirds of its territory. All applicants need is a basic command of the language and Hungarian ancestry – and for many the benefits of applying are obvious. The average salary in Serbia is £5,200 before tax, compared with £26,500 in Britain. In the Serbian town of Subotica, on the Hungarian border – one of dozens of centres where applications are processed – more than 12,000 Serbians were granted Hungarian citizenship last year. Hungary’s general consul in Subotica, Tamas Korsos, admitted many Serbian citizens applied for Hungarian citizenship merely ‘to travel more easily with a Hungarian passport’. ‘I do not condemn that in any way. Everyone looks after his own interests,’ he said. Outside the consulate in Subotica earlier this year, the Mail interviewed several Serbian residents as they emerged with their yellow certificates declaring them Hungarian citizens. Lorry driver Jozsef Szucs, 47, admitted he applied for dual nationality ‘so I can move to the UK’, where he will earn five times his £5,000-a-year salary. Floodgates: A report by Her Majesty¿s Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration, John Vine, said the 'European citizenship route¿' was becoming 'an increasingly important way into the UK for those whose origins lie outside the EEA (European Economic Area)' Struggling to support his wife and 15-year-old daughter on his meagre wage, he trawled European recruitment websites and found ‘many jobs’ for HGV drivers in Britain. ‘England is a nice country and it will be a new challenge for me. I cannot make a good life for my family here,’ he said. In the town centre, there is a large poster advertising an English language school with the motto, ‘Money is coming’. Klara Agatics, 56, said her son moved to Warrington, Cheshire, to work in a factory last year after obtaining a Hungarian passport. She said: ‘The [Hungarian] law is a very good thing. In a couple of years, I think there won’t be any borders – England, Serbia, Hungary, it won’t matter, you will just go where you can find a job.’ Applicants for Hungarian passports must prove that they have ancestors ‘who were Hungarian or lived on the territory of ex-Hungary and can prove it by death or birth certificates’. However, the vague language requirement, which states simply that you ‘know the language’, is open to exploitation. There is no exam or standardised list of questions, so it is down to busy clerks in individual offices around Serbia and Hungary to assess the skills during a brief meeting. The Home Office admitted it had no way of monitoring how many of the 500,000 new Hungarian citizens had made their way to Britain. A spokesman said its EU migration figures did not include a breakdown of people’s country of origin. Bulgaria and Romania have introduced similar laws to Hungary, offering national status to people living in non-EU states such as Moldova, Macedonia, Serbia, Ukraine and Turkey. Under fire: HM Passport Chief Executive Paul Pugh . Ministers were accused of ‘profiting from the public’s hardship’ last night after it emerged the shambolic Passport Office is making £13 profit on every document issued. MPs said that, instead of the Government raking in £73million in surplus every year, the money should be poured into tackling the backlog of 480,000 outstanding passport applications that is threatening to wreck family holidays. The Passport Office was forced to admit a profit margin of more than 20 per cent under pressure from the Home Affairs Committee. In figures sent to MPs, under-fire chief executive Paul Pugh said the average cost of processing each application was just £59.40 – compared with a standard price of £72.50 for a passport. He also released statistics which revealed ministers and officials should have realised as early as January this year that the service was heading for a crisis as there were 552,192 applications compared with only 482,356 in January last year. The chaos has led to a huge increase in staff overtime, on rates of up to £70 per hour – with almost £1million being spent in May alone. Almost three quarters of countries will not accept UK passports that have been given 12-month extensions under plans to alleviate the backlog in applications, it has been revealed. Home Secretary Theresa May last week announced that expat Britons who need to renew their passports would be given one-year extensions. But now the Government has admitted only 50 countries have confirmed they will accept the extended passports, with the US, Australia and India not on the list.","Law introduced in 2011 has allowed 550,000 non-EU residents to apply .

"A former Republican congressional candidate who owes his mini-stardom to a chance encounter with Barack Obama during his first presidential campaign wrote in an open letter to shooting victims' families that their grief can't override the Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.

'I myself have a son and daughter and the one thing I never want to go through, is what you are going through now.' 'But: As harsh as this sounds – your dead kids don't trump my Constitutional rights.' His harsh words came a day after Richard Martinez, whose so Christopher was gunned down Friday night by mass-killer Elliot Rodger, blamed the National Rifle Association and 'craven, irresponsible politicians' for his son's death.

Rodger went on a stabbing-and-shooting spree near the University of California, Santa Barbara. Wurzelbacher became a Republican mascot when Obama answered his question about bisuness tax increases on a rope line in 2008, saying that 'when you spread the wealth around, it’s good for everybody.' He published his open letter at BarbWire, a conservative blog. Martinez, he wrote, 'can say whatever he wants and blame whoever he'd like – it's okay by me.' 'You can't take a step in his shoes – at least I can't.' 'But the words and images of Mr. Martinez blaming 'the proliferation of guns,' lobbyists, politicians, etc.; will be exploited by gun-grab extremists,' he argued, 'as are all tragedies involving gun violence and the mentally ill by the anti-Second Amendment Left.' He insisted that he will 'continue to speak out' for his right to own a gun, 'and against those who would restrict it – even in the face of this horrible incident by this sad and insane individual.' 'I almost said ""Obama Voter,"" Wurzelbacher added, referring to the gunman, 'but I'm waiting for it to be official.' Rodger stabbed three of his six victims to death, but the conservative activist was quick to point out that he was speaking 'only to the families of the gunshot victims.' xxxxxxxxxx . cccccccccc .

UCSB graduate student Jeb Sprague held a gun-control sign on Friday after the killings, but before Richard Martinez blamed the mass shooting on the NRA and America's gun culture . And addressing Martinez, he sniped: 'Any feelings you have toward my rights being taken away from me, lose those.' Martinez has seemed laser-focused on gun control since his son was tragically murdered. He told The Washington Post on Tuesday that he's tired of politicians calling him with condolences but without a plan to prevent the next gun massacre. 'I don't care about your sympathy,' he said he tells them. 'I don't give a s*** that you feel sorry for me.' And with tears rolling, he told the Post what he demands of them.

"Dressed in black from head to toe, and wearing a flowing robe, this is the first image seen in years of the world’s most wanted man, whose terrorist group has butchered thousands and stolen more than a billion pounds in gold and cash. Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the elusive leader of the Al Qaeda splinter group Islamic State of Iraq and Sham (Isis), walked out of the shadows and delivered a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq’s second largest city. He addressed the packed congregation – which included  Isis fighters and local sympathisers – on the first Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in the heart of a city  his fighters took control of barely a month ago.

He also declared large swathes of northern Syria and  Iraq seized by his . fighters as his new caliphate. A video of Baghdadi’s sermon was released on the internet yesterday and went viral instantly on jihadist forums and websites. Speaking from the pulpit of the . mosque, Baghdadi, 42, urged the world’s Muslims to flock to the new . Islamic caliphate. He praised the victory of his 14,000 fighters spread . across Iraq and Syria. The speech was an audacious move for a . man who has a £6 million bounty on his head and who would be a target . of attacks by drones or US forces. Until yesterday, there were only two . known images of Baghdadi. They were at least four years old and taken by . US soldiers when he was in detention in Iraq. 'The mujahedeen have been rewarded victory by God after years of jihad, and they were able to achieve their aim and hurried to announce the caliphate and choose the Imam,' says al-Baghdadi . During the appearance by al-Baghdadi the mobile signal was blocked in and around the area of Mosul and remained blocked for several hours . Al-Baghdadi cleaned his teeth with a miswak, the dental stick used by the Prophet, before he spoke to worshippers in the mosque .

Raffaello Pantucci, a security expert . at the think-tank RUSI, said: ‘The video is emblematic of the confidence . that Baghdadi and Isis feel about themselves. ‘They have consolidated a large part of Syria and Iraq into what they call a caliphate, and he is asserting his leadership.’ Nour al-Maliki, Iraqi Prime Minister has sacked some key sdvisers .

"Sparks flew during a rare late-night hearing before the House Veterans Affairs Committee, as visibly upset Republicans raked VA officials over the coals while the ink was still wet on a scathing inspector general report condemning the agency's deadly failures. The report found that in Phoenix, Arizona alone, 1,700 U.S. military veterans were denied medical care and others waited an average of 115 days to be seen by a doctor – and that officials covered up the lapses by manipulating wait-lists and other official records. Tennessee Republican Rep. Phil Roe, a physician and veteran of the Army Medical Corps, summed up the mood on Capitol Hill when he addressed Dr. Thomas Lynch, the VA's assistant deputy undersecretary for health. Noting that the three officials at the witness table are well-paid but presided over a system that ignored the needs of cash-strapped veterans who are locked into the VA health system, he leveled a sledgehammer at Lynch . 'What I don't understand is, as a veteran – as a doctor, as a practitioner – I don't understand how you can stand at a mirror and look at yourself in the mirror, and shave in the morning, and not throw up,' he said, 'knowing that you've got people out there ... how in the world?'

They live in my communities, and they can't get in, and they're . desperate to get in,' howled an incredulous Roe. 'And someone who's making $180,000 a year gets a . bonus for not taking care of the veterans? I don't get that.' Rep. Jeff . Miller, a Florida Republican who chairs the panel, wasted no time in . going after VA Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative . Affairs Joan Mooney. 'Until VA understands that we’re deadly serious, you can expect us to be over your shoulder every single day,' he told her. And then 'deadly serious' became, literally, deadly. 'Why have you not told this committee yet who was disciplined in Augusta, Georgia and Columbia, South Carolina, where nine veterans died because they were on a waiting list for colonoscopies?' Miller asked. Mooney deflected the question, saying that her office had 'responded to more than 100,000 requests for information,'  but Miller was unimpressed. 'Ma’am! Ma’am! Ma’am! Ma’am!' he exclaimed. 'Veterans died! Get us the answers, please!' 'I understand that, Mr. Chairman,' Mooney replied, and I will look —' 'That’s what you said three months ago!' Miller boomed. 'This has been going on since January. Since January.' 'In case you don’t know it, we put on our website every week what we ask for,' he said, 'and nothing changes from week to week.' U.S. military veterans were on hand to hear testimony about unauthorized wait-lists in the Phoenix VA Health Care System -- a 'systemic' mismanagement problem that has brought calls for VA Secretary Eric Shinseki to resign . No more Mr. nice guy: Rep. Miller sparred with witnesses about everything from missing paperwork to their habit of looking to prepared notes for canned answers. A VA inspector general's report released Wednesday showed that at least 1,700 veterans in Phoenix, Arizona, were not registered on the proper waiting list to see doctors -- while the hospital falsely reported minimal waiting times to hide delays . Miller aired a laundry list of complaints about the VA's response to congressional demands, including the agency's refusal to brief members of Congress. 'We did ask the [VA] Office of General Counsel to come brief members last week, and the general counsel declined,' the Floridian said. 'He said he declined because he didn’t want to brief the members – he wanted to brief the staff.' 'It takes repeated requests and threats of compulsion to get VA to bring their people here,' a disgusted Miller concluded. Mooney got he worst of it. As she referred to prepared notes in order to answer questions, an outraged Miller lost patience. 'Can you say anything without reading your prepared notes?' he demanded? The VA has reportedly provided the committee with 5,500 pages of documents, but lawmakers are convinced there's much more to be found. 'Let me be clear: I am not happy,' said Maine Rep. Michael Michaud, the committee's ranking Democrat. 'We'll get to the bottom of this, uncover the truth, and ensure a solution is implemented to make sure something like this never happens again.' Department of Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary for Congressional and Legislative Affairs Joan Mooney (R) got the worst of Wednesday night's hearing, with House members slamming her for withholding documents Congress has subpoenaed . Flop sweat: Lynch was visibly shaken as he answered questions about the VA's crumbling accountability and the deaths of 40 veterans in Phoenix alone . Roe was more pointed. 'If you don't give us the information,' he said, 'I'm thinking, ""There's something they're trying to hide.""  Why wouldn't you just turn over the documents, and – they are what they are. Just tell the truth.' 'Is there a reason? ... In my mind, I'm thinking right now that you're hiding something from me. And I have no reason to believe you're not,' he said. The three VA witnesses were not permitted to offer an opening statement. A Veterans Affairs Committee staff member told MailOnline that there was some internal debate about that decision. 'I guess if they had something to tell us, they should have told us years ago. That was the thinking.' Questions arose about how and why documents related to the Phoenix cover-up were destroyed – especially off-the-books waiting lists that showed a realistic picture of how long veterans waited for their doctor visits. On Wednesday at least 58 members of Congress, including 20 Democrats, demanded VA Secretary Eric Shinseki's resignation, with Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain leading the charge and calling on President Barack Obama to fire him if he didn't step down. Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman added to the bloodletting in the evening, demanding the termination of all three witnesses: Lynch, Mooney, and Michael Huff, a VA congressional relations officer. 'You are not being forthright in your testimony,' Coffman boomed. 'You are here to serve yourselves and not the men and women who have made extraordinary sacrifices to serve this country.'","One Tennessee congressman told a VA official: 'I don't understand how you can stand at a mirror and look at yourself in the mirror, and shave in the morning, and not throw up'

"Concern is growing for the safety of a courageous Chinese activist who was detained after helping a blind dissident escape house arrest. Human rights campaigners believe He Peirong was arrested for her involvement in the plot which freed legal activist Chen Guangcheng, 40, who had been in captivity for almost six years. At least four members of Chen's family and another of his supporters are also thought to have been rounded up. Concerns: Fears are growing for He Peirong, left, who has been detained for her involvement in the plot to free Chen Guangcheng, from house arrest . He Peirong, from Nanjing, had been at the forefront of the campaign to free Chen, a self-taught 'barefoot lawyer' who was jailed for four years and then held for 19 months under heavy guard after exposing forced abortions as part of China's one-child policy. She claimed she had driven Chen to a 'relatively safe place' after he dodged more than 100 guards and broke loose from Dongshigu village, in China's Shangdong province, southeast of Beijing. Chen was then driven 350 miles through the countryside to the U.S. Embassy. Bob Fu, of Texas-based human rights group China Aid, is reported to have spoken to He Peirong on Friday, but she hung up when she told him 'public security' was at the door. Friends have been unable to contact her since then and her phone was switched off on Friday evening. Rounded up: Activists fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, pictured with the activist and their son . Police in Nanjing said they knew nothing of the case. One user on Sina's microblog service compared He Peirong to Spider-Man 'bravely going to dangerous places'. The message continued: 'She has been beaten and insulted in [Dongshigu]. 'She keeps her faith and courage.' Activists . now fear for the safety of Chen's wife, Yuan Weijing, his six-year-old . daughter, his elderly mother and other family members who they believe . have been rounded up in retribution. HIs nephew, Chen Kegu, was said to be in hiding after using a kitchen knife to defend his mother from intruders. Retribution: Several members of Chen's family are believed to have been detained following his escape . Another activist, Gao Yushan, is also believed to have been detained. Li . Fangping, a rights lawyer who tried to represent Chen in his court . case, told Associated Press that state security had questioned him on . Friday. Sophie Richardson, of Human Rights Watch, said: 'It has been extraordinary – this is high stakes stuff. High-level talks: The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell arrived at a hotel in Beijing to discuss the case . 'None of these people will have gone into it without a pretty clear idea of what might happen to them as a result. 'That shows extraordinary courage on the part of activists who are extremely vulnerable to exactly these kinds of reprisals … In my view, the least other governments can do is stand with them.' The U.S. has declined to comment on Chen's whereabouts, but a photograph has emerged of him meeting fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed location in Beijing. China Aid has issued a statement claiming it . 'learned from a source close to the Chen Guangcheng situation that Chen . is under U.S. protection'. The group said 'high-level talks' were under way . between U.S. and Chinese officials regarding Chen's 'status'. The claims could overshadow a two-day meeting with top Obama administration officials, including Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, in Beijing from Thursday, and ignite new tensions between the two governments. The top U.S. diplomat for East Asia, Kurt Campbell was today seen arriving at a hotel in Beijing, to discuss the case. Mr Fu said: 'Because . of Chen's wide popularity, the Obama Administration must stand firmly . with him or risk losing credibility as a defender of freedom and the . rule of law.' The reports of Chen's escape come nearly three months after a Chinese official Wang Lijun fled into a U.S. consulate for over 24 hours on February 6, unleashing a scandal that has rattled the ruling Communist Party months before a once-in-a-decade leadership handover. Secret meeting: Blind legal activist Chen Guangcheng has spoken to fellow Chinese dissident Hu Jia at an undisclosed location in Beijing . Anger: The activist's detention for exposing forced abortions in China caused international outcry . Wang's brief flight to the U.S. consulate led to the downfall of top official Bo Xilai who had been . openly campaigning for a place in the inner circle of power in Beijing. Pu Zhiqiang, a Beijing lawyer and . rights advocate, said reliable contacts also told him Chen took refuge . in U.S. embassy grounds. He said: 'Everyone knew about the . suffering of Chen Guangcheng and his family but nobody dared raised his . head over this and ignored it. 'Chen Guangcheng has been the most . typical victim of this lawless, boundless exercise of power. But the day . has finally come when he has escaped from it.' Chen angered authorities in 2005 by . exposing forced abortion in his own village and others nearby as part of . China's one-child policy. Surrounded: Visitors trying to see Chen Guangcheng, including Christian Bale, have been forcibly removed from the village by over-zealous Chinese guards . He . was jailed soon after on a charge of 'blocking traffic' and damaging . property in a protest, and has been held under house arrested ever since . his release in September 2010. Lawyers and activists attempted to . visit Chen in him home ever since have been forcibly denied entry to his . village by guards, while the man himself compared his own home to a . 'prison' due to his plight. It . is thought the Chinese authorities had no legal grounds for detaining . him, and guards even scuffled with Hollywood star Christian Bale when . the Batman actor tried to visit Chen in his home.","He Peirong was arrested for helping Chen flee to the U.S. Embassy, campaigners believe .

"A ruthless drug smuggler known as the 'Godmother of Cocaine' who was jailed in the U.S. for three chilling murders has been gunned down by a motorcycle-riding hitman. Griselda Blanco, 69, was believed to have ordered dozens of executions during the notorious 'cocaine cowboys' era of the 1970s and 80s in Miami. In a grim irony, the mode of her killing was eerily similar to the brutal drive-by killings she herself introduced to slaughter her enemies. Scroll down for video... Queenpin: Griselda Blanco (pictured) has been shot dead outside a . butcher's shop in Colombia at the age of 69 in what many say is a . fitting end to her life of drug smuggling and murder . Ruthless: The Colombian was jailed for 20 years for three murders in the U.S. including that of a two-year-old . Although she was suspected of murdering many more, the Colombian was eventually convicted of three killings in 1985, including that of a two-year-old boy, for which she served nearly 20 years behind bars. In 2004, she was deported to her native country and maintained a low profile in her hometown of Medellin. According . to Colombian press reports, she was walking out of a butcher's shop . yesterday when two gunmen on motorbikes pulled up before one pumped two . bullets into her head. For a . woman who had been credited with inventing the notion of a 'motorcycle . assassin', the manner of her death came as no surprise to many, it was . reported in The Miami Herald. 'Made many enemies': Brought up in the slums of Medellin, Blanco went from a simple pickpocket to command an empire that shipped an estimated 3,400lbs of cocaine a month . Murderous matriarch: Blanco ran her empire with three of her sons, two . of whom were later assassinated in Colombia, while three of her husbands . have also been killed in drug-related violence . Evil Empire: An image from the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys which explored Blanco's part in the rise of the drug trade in Miami . Nelson . Andreu, a former Miami homicide detective who had investigated her, . said: 'It’s surprising to all of us that she had not been killed sooner . because she made a lot of enemies. 'When . you kill so many and hurt so many people like she did, it’s only a . matter of time before they find you and try to even the score.' Former murder detective Nelson . Andreu . Brought . up in the slums of Medellin, Blanco went from a simple pickpocket to . command an empire that shipped an estimated 3,400lbs of cocaine a month. She also symbolised the . blood-soaked era of the 1970s and 80s when gangs would ambush their . rivals in public, leading to her cartel being dubbed the 'Cocaine . Cowboys'. She ran the empire with three of her . sons, two of whom were later assassinated in Colombia, while three of . her husbands have also been killed in drug-related violence. Cocaine capital: The drug trade that pervaded Miami under Blanco and her rivals inspired the Hollywood film Scarface, starring Al Pacino as Tony Montana (above) Flamboyant lifestyle: Blanco was so captivated by her gangland image she even named one of her sons Michael Corleone after the character played by Al Pacino (above) in The Godfather movies . Known for her flamboyant lifestyle, she named one of her sons Michael Corleone in tribute to The Godfather movies. Blanco's . exploits were also popularised in the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, . which explored the rise of the drug in Miami during the 1970s and 80s . which inspired the films Scarface and Miami Vice. Interviewees argue that Blanco played a major role in the history of the drug trade in the city and other areas across America. Detectives believe she was behind at least 40 murders and maybe even as many as 240, but could only link her to three. Built on crime: Much of the economic development in Miami (above) during the 70s and 80s was credited to the inexorable rise of the cocaine trade . Two of them, drug dealers Alfredo and . Grizel Lorenzo, were shot at their South Miami house after failing to . pay $250,000 for 5kg of cocaine. Blanco was also convicted of ordering a shooting that led to the death of two-year-old Johnny Castro, who was shot twice in the head as he drove in the car with his father, Jesus 'Chucho' Castro. She was fully expected to end up on Florida's Death Row. But she was able to cut a plea deal after the prosecution's case suffered a major setback when a chief witness was caught engaging in phone sex with secretaries from the attorney's office. Blanco later entered into a bargain with new prosecutors and was given three 20-year sentences in 1985. She only served a third of that time. Prior to the mid-1970s, marijuana had been the main import into Miami and the surrounding areas. But over the following years this was replaced by more lucrative cocaine. Crime lords used many different tactics to smuggle drugs into the country, but the main routes were by boat or air. The distribution networks were highly elaborate and technology such as electronic homing devices were employed to keep track of shipments. Condominiums were bought near the ocean to act as reconnaissance stations to look out for coast guards and cartels monitored the radio frequencies of Federal, State and local authorities. Legitimate businesses were then bought to shield these operations from the outside world. The 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys, right, reveals that much of the economic growth in Miami came from the drug trade as the cash that flowed into these businesses went on to indirectly finance the construction of many high-rise buildings in southern Florida. When law enforcement finally got on top of the corruption, many companies folded because of falling sales.","Gangland matriarch Griselda Blanco shot in head as she left butcher's .

"Painful: Mark Goddard, 44, sliced his hand off in his garden with a homemade guillotine to end years of pain - but it still hurts . A motorcycle crash victim has amputated his injured hand with a homemade guillotine to end 16 years of unbearable pain only to find his arm still hurts. Desperate Mark Goddard, 44, says he was driven to cut it off because the NHS refused to, and even burned his severed limb to ensure surgeons could not reattach it. The father-of-one took a fortnight to build the guillotine using an axe, some springs and an old gate post, which took his left hand off ten days ago. But unfortunately the DIY amputation in his garden, carried out without any anaesthetic, has failed to take away the pain that has tormented him since he was 28. Mr Goddard from Newton Abbot, Devon, has now told his local hospital that unless they cut his arm off from the elbow by December he will do it himself. The unemployed former garage owner, who is right handed, says his severe pain began after a 1998 motorbike accident left him with nerve damage. But doctors refused to operate because they considered his hand and wrist healthy, he said. 'I should not have to go to such extremes to get my pain stopped,' Mr Goddard said. 'There . was an alternative and that was having it done properly in hospital. But no one would do anything to help me - so I did it myself. 'I got rid of it because they told me they had problems amputating my arm with a good hand on it. 'So It took it off myself and now there is no reason why the can't operate.' When he sliced it off his horrified wife Samantha came home ten minutes later and found her husband had tossed the severed limb onto a fire in the garden. She called the emergency services but by the time police and paramedics arrived the hand had been too badly burnt to be saved. Mr Goddard says he lost two pints of blood but paramedics were able to stabilise him. He previously tried to use a knife to remove his hand but only managed to severe three tendons and a nerve. Scroll down for video . WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT BELOW . Grim: This is the contraption used to slice off the limb, which took it clean off. Mr Goddard then threw his hand on a fire to stop anyone reattaching it . Determined: The stump of Mark Goddard's arm after he chopped his own hand off after years of battling with the NHS . Sabotage: As soon as his hand was removed he tossed it into a fire he started in this bucket to ensure it could not be reattached . Mr Goddard says doctors now have no excuse not to operate. The former biker hopes he will now get a more 'reasonable hearing' from medics now they can see how determined he is. He takes 40 painkillers a day but wants a device called a spinal stimulator implanted into his back to ease his pain. Mr Goddard said: 'There should never have been any need for me to do this. 'It would have spared so much distress all round but it was the only way. At least if I do have the treatment it will I need it will give me and my family our lives back. 'I've told them that if nothing is done, I will take the arm off above the elbow myself. I've given them until the end of December.' Mr Goddard insist he has undergone three psychiatric evaluations and passed all of them and police admitted that he was still 'rational' after his amputation. He also says he barely felt anything as his homemade guillotine came down because he used a weight strapped to it to ensure it had enough force to amputate his hand. The first blow sliced though the bone but did it not sever all the tendons, leaving his hand hanging off. Previous attempt: The father-of-one had in the past tried to cut his hand off with a knife - but failed - so decided on a guillotine . His family have since dismantled his device and banned him from going into the tool shed where he built it in secret. 'I bought an axe and got some bits of wood together before assembling them in the shed. 'It took me two weeks to build because I had to wait until my wife was out of the way. Plan: Mr Goddard said he waited for his family to be out of the house before he sliced off his hand. He is now banned from the shed where he made the guillotine in secret . 'On the day itself I planned everything to a tee.  I . got my wife cleaning the car and went down to the shed, assembled the . gadget outside, put my arm under it, looked away - and dropped the axe. 'At . first I didn't think it had worked because I didn't feel anything - but . then I looked down and could see the bone cut through. 'There was a little flesh and tendons still there so I used a scalpel to remove them, that was the painful bit. 'I used three bandages and cable ties to contain the blood before scalding the artery. 'I then texted my wife to call an ambulance and went inside to admit what I'd done. She was horrified. 'The blood was going everywhere so my wife got a hose out to hose down all the blood and mess. 'She called the emergency services and the police and ambulance turned up.' The former garage owner had suffered excruciating nerve pain since he was in a motorbike accident when he was 28 years old. He . was riding through London when a car came speeding around a corner and . knocked him off, cracking a vertebrae in his neck, damaging his spine . and shattering his clavicle. Calm in a crisis: After the guillotine struck a blow he used a scalpel to separate it and then used bandages and cable ties to stem the flow of blood . A piece of plastic became embedded in his arm, damaging nerves and condemning him to a lifetime of pain. Mark . added: 'I've been experiencing chronic pain ever since my accident but . they refused to amputate because my hand is still useful . 'I've explained to doctors, psychologists and specialists that if this pain isn't stopped I would remove the limb myself. 'I'm . still in a lot of pain. I knew it would still hurt above the elbow but . without the hand they have have no excuse to keep the arm'. Mark's wife Samantha, 43, who has supported his efforts to have his arm surgically removed, told The Sun: ' I knew he was up to something that day, but I thought he was planning a secret treat as a surprise. 'When I came into the house and saw the blood everywhere I said ""Oh God - what have you done?"" I couldn't believe it.' Devon and Cornwall Police said officers could do nothing to save the hand after being alerted to the self-mutilation at 1:40pm on March 17. In the past: Mark, aged 20, on his wedding day shaking the hand of his best man. But his life changed after motorcycle accident eight years later where he suffered broken bones and nerve damage . The NHS Trust maintains it tries to avoid amputation if at all possible because it will not always remove pain. 'We were very sorry to learn that Mr Goddard had amputated his hand. We will continue to support him through our orthopaedics and pain management services,' a spokesman said. 'It would be wrong of us to comment on the details of his specific case, as that would breach our duty of confidentiality. However, doctors always try to avoid amputation if they possibly can, particularly for patients with non-paralyzed limbs. 'There is no evidence that amputation removes pain. In fact nerve pain is often generated in the spinal cord, rather than in the painful limb itself; so for many people, the pain continues. They can also get phantom limb pain after amputation, and therefore may be in a worse situation than they were before'.","Mark Goddard, 44, used an axe, some springs and a gate post to cut it off .

"Embarrassed: New Orleans assistant city attorney Jason Cantrell, 43, was issued a summons after getting caught with a joint in court . A New Orleans lawyer would have saved himself a lot of trouble if only he checked his pockets before heading to court on Monday. Assistant city attorney Jason Cantrell was issued a summons after he dropped a joint while talking to a police officer in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court. Cantrell, 43, was cited for simple drug possession and released under a city policy for low-level marijuana cases, according to police. According to the New Orleans Police Department spokesperson Garry Flot, Cantrell was talking to one of the officers waiting to testify in court when the rolled up joint tumbled out of his pocket and landed on the floor. People who witnessed the comical scene said that two officers glanced at the joint, and then exchanged a bemused look before making arguably the world's easiest drug bust. The pair were spotted chuckling as their colleagues led Cantrell out of the courtroom at around 4.15pm to issue him a summons. Ryan Berni, a spokesman for Mayor Mitch Landrieu's office, told the New Orleans Times-Picayune that at the time of the incident, Cantrell was not working on behalf of the city. He was suspended without pay pending an investigation. Comic scene: Cantrell was talking to a cop waiting to testify in Orleans Parish Criminal District Court when a joint fell out of his pocket on the floor . According to a statement issued by Cantrell's wife, LaToya Cantrell, her husband resigned his city post late Monday. Besides handing traffic court cases in his capacity as an assistant city attorney, Cantrell also has a private practice. Calls to Cantrell's office were not immediately returned. Cantrell has practiced civil and criminal law in New Orleans for 17 years, including six as a public defender in Juvenile Court. In an ironic twist, the 43-year-old also worked as a drug court attorney. In 2009, he lost in a race for a Juvenile Court judgeship. His wife is currently vying for a seat on the City Council. In an apparent attempt to minimize . the fallout from the embarrassing incident, LaToya Cantrell issued a . statement apologizing for her husband’s actions and saying that she is . ‘angry, embarrassed, and disappointed’ with the 43-year-old’s ‘lack of . judgment.’ Ambitious: Cantrell, left, unsuccessfully ran for a Juvenile Court judgeship in 2009, and now his wife, right, is vying for a seat on the City Council . ‘I love my husband unconditionally and am very concerned for his health and well-being, and for that of our family,’ Cantrell said. ‘I hope that this incident will encourage Jason to seek the professional help he needs and ask that the public respect our privacy in this very personal family matter.’ The City Council in late 2010 made marijuana possession a municipal offense, allowing police to issue a summons rather than arrest and book an offender on state charges in an effort to reduce the case load. This is not the first time a member of the legal community has been caught with drugs. According to the blog Above the Law, a Texas judge was arrested in February when he was busted with 20 grams of marijuana in his hotel room.","Jason Cantrell, 43, was issued a summons and released under a city policy for marijuana cases .

"The Obama administration told law enforcement to 'stand down' and not arrest Occupy Wall Street protesters even though some may have broken the law, newly-obtained documents have revealed. Emails show the General Services Administration told authorities in Portland, Oregon not to enforce curfews on protesters camped out on federal property, on the orders of the White House. This relaxed approach will likely raise concerns over the government's willingness to protect its workers or punish the anti-capitalist movement's wrong-doers. Relaxed: Emails have revealed the White House told law enforcement officials in Portland, Oregon (pictured) to 'stand down' and not arrest Occupy protesters on federal-owned property last year . The correspondence between Robert Peck, the federal agency's former commissioner, and a senior official from the Department of Homeland Security were obtained by the conservative watchdog, JudicialWatch.org. In one email sent on November 6, 2011, officials from the two agencies discussed a group of 11 protesters who had camped out at Terry Schrunk Plaza, a downtown park. 'They have chained themselves to a large drum filled with concrete,' Caitlin Durkovich, chief of staff at the Department of Homeland Security/National Protection and Programs Directorate wrote. 'GSA controls the permits and has asked [Federal Protective Services] not to enforce the curfew at park and the prohibition on overnight encampments. Questions: An email dated November 6, 2011 from a Department of Homeland Security official asks for confirmation they are 'standing down'. Thh emails were obtained by JudicialWatch.org . Response: Robert Peck, the former commissioner for Public Buildings Services for the government agency, writes that it is the White House's request that the protesters are not arrested . 'Our FPS Commander in Portland says they are standing down and following GSA's request to only intervene if there is a threat to public safety.' Peck, the recipient of the email, replied: 'Caitlin: yes, that is our position; it's been vetted with our administrator and Michael Robertson, our chief of staff, and we have communicated with the WH [White House], which has afforded us the discretion to fashion our approach to Occupy issues. 'The arrests last week were carried out despite our request that the protesters be allowed to remain and to camp overnight.' The emails come several days after the start of protests on GSA-owned property; a week before, Portland police, some wearing riot gear, had arrested 25 protestors. Judicial Watch President Tom Fitton said the emails show the White House was protecting Occupy protesters, Fox News reported. Messenger: Peck, left, claimed he was passing on orders from President Obama's White House . 'These documents clearly show that . federal agencies colluded with the Obama White House to allow the Occupy . Wall Street protesters to violate the law with impunity,' he said. 'These documents tell us that the GSA and DHS can't be relied upon to protect federal workers or property.' A spokeswoman for the GSA told Fox in . a written statement: 'The General Services Administration worked . closely with the Portland Police Bureau and the Federal Protective . Service (FPS) in maintaining the health and safety of the general . public, protesters and federal employees during last year's Portland . Occupy protests. 'However FPS and local law enforcement had the best . understanding of the situation on the ground in Terry Schrunk Park, and . determined the necessary action.' Asked if she was specifically saying Peck was in error, spokesperson Mafara Hobson told The Washington Examiner: . 'Yes, I'm saying that the decisions that were made were based on the . judgment of the law enforcement folks on the ground ONLY. He's not . correct.' Clashes: Despite requests to 'go easy' on protesters, there were still numerous clashes, with riot gear-clad police using pepper spray (pictured) and arresting more than 180 people in total at Portland . Shutting down: The tents in Portland were finally cleared on November 13, but the movement continues . Peck resigned in April this year following reports over his agency's excessive spending at a training conference, which featured a mindreader, a clown and a comedian. The Occupy Wall Street movement spread across the United States last year after beginning in the financial district of Manhattan in September following the protests from the Arab Spring. Despite the White House's reported desire for officials to 'go easy' on protesters, some of the most violent Occupy clashes occurred in Portland and a total of 184 people have been arrested there in conjunction with the movement, according to OccupyArrests.com. The camp was eventually dismantled on November 13 but the group still plans and carries out acts of civil disobedience, including a picket that shut down the port in December.","General Services Administration told police not to arrest protesters on federal property in Portland - even though they may have broken laws .

"Dead: Sex offender Charles Mozdir, 32, had been on the run for two years prior to being shot dead following a dramatic shoot-out in New York City on Monday afternoon . A sex offender who had been on the run for two years after skipping bail for molesting two boys under the age of seven in California has been shot and killed in New York City in a dramatic shoot-out with federal marshals and police. Charles Mozdir, 32, was killed in the exchange and his weapon has been recovered. His case had featured on CNN’s The Hunt last week, which is believed to have led to a tip-off about his location. The shooting happened just after 1pm in the West Village, not far from New York University, when a fugitive apprehension task force tried to serve a warrant at a shop called Smoking Culture NYC. The store sells items including bongs, cigarettes and cigars and it is believed that Mozdir was behind the counter and working when the authorities showed up. Two U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective were wounded in the shooting which erupted at around 1pm today. The officers were part of a special task force investigating Mozdir. They entered the shop to serve him with a warrant when he pulled a revolver on them. He also had 20 spare rounds of ammunition in his pockets. Sources say one of the marshals was shot in the leg and the NYPD detective was shot three times. Emergency workers transported all four victims to Bellevue Hospital, where the suspect died. NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton would not say today how the U.S. Marshalls' task force, a joint operation with the police, became aware that Mozdir was in the shop. Scroll down for video . Injured: Two U.S. Marshals and an NYPD detective were wounded in the shooting which erupted at around 1pm Monday in New York City's West Village . Dangerous: Police officers stand guard at the scene of the shooting . One of the marshals was shot in the leg and the NYPD detective - named as NYPD Detective Mario Muniz, 45, - was shot three times. The detective has 20 years service with the NYPD and had recently been promoted, Bratton said. Mayor Bill De Blasio said on Monday that the officers were recovering and 'in good spirits'. He added that the detective's life had been saved by his bullet-proof vest. Jerry DeWitt, who lives on the West Village street where the shooting took place, arrived minutes after the shoot-out and described the scene as 'pure chaos'. 'You expect anything to happen here but not this,' he told MailOnline. Another resident, Christine Rucci, who lives opposite the shop, told MailOnline that at first she heard a loud noise and when she looked out her front window she noticed the shop was surrounded by a number of unmarked cars and there was a helicopter overhead. She estimated that there are four elementary schools nearby. 'What is really upsetting is that he was a sex offender and that he had a gun,' she told MailOnline. Saved by the vest: NYPD Commissioner Bill Bratton and Mayor Bill De Blasio hold up the police detective's bullet-proof vest on Monday to show where he was shot. They said the item likely saved his life . Heavy presence: Police quickly cordoned off the area around the Smoking Culture NYC store in the West Village where the shooting took place . Onlookers: People look on at the crime scene where two U.S. Marshals and one NYPD detective tried to apprehend a suspect who was shot and killed . Ms Rucci, who has lived in the area for 25 years said it used to feel very safe - especially when Michael Bloomberg's daughter lived in the same building - but that there had also been a shooting on Mother's Day on the same street. A $1 million bench warrant was issued for Mozdir's arrest on June 15, 2012, after he skipped an arraignment in San Diego Superior Court on child sexual assault charges, according to Steve Walker, a spokesman for the San Diego County district attorney. He had posted $250,000 bail. Mozdir had been wanted on five counts of lewd acts upon a child younger than 14 and a charge of attempting to keep a witness from prosecuting a crime, according to the criminal complaint. The one-time wedding photographer has been accused by a family friend of molesting her seven-year-old son while babysitting him in Coronado, near . San Diego. After he disappeared, investigators had found sickening images of child pornography and bestiality on his cell phone and computers at his home. It is believed that Mozdir (pictured left) was working behind the counter of Smoking Culture NYC (right) when the fugitive apprehension task force showed up and he pulled his gun on them . An ambulance sits near where two U.S. Marshals and one NYPD detective were shot in the West Village on Monday afternoon . Tip off: Mozdir's case featured on a recent episode of CNN's The Hunt and a tip-off received after the program aired on Sunday led to the task force closing in on Mozdir at his place of work . He was considered armed and dangerous . since a roommate told police that Mozdir, armed with two guns, . threatened to kill himself and a victim's father. Law enforcement had hunted him from California to Mexico to the deep south and finally to New York City. According to CNN, after the episode of The Hunt featuring Mozdir aired . authorities received a tip that he was working at a restaurant in . Manhattan, but the information didn't pan out. After CNN . re-aired Mozdir's episode on Sunday night, another tip came in that . resulted in an address for Mozdir, according to John Walsh. Mayor Bill de Blasio says the three are . stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that . these officers will be OK in the long run.' New York City Police Commissioner Bill Bratton visited the crime scene and spoke to the media near where two U.S. Marshals and one NYPD detective had been shot . The shooting happened just after 1 p.m. in the West Village not far from New York University when a fugitive apprehension task force tried to serve a warrant outside a smoke shop just north of a busy subway station . Authorities say the suspect was wanted in a sexual assault case and the officers are reported to have been part of a fugitive task force searching for a sex offender in the area . Police Commissioner Bill Bratton said the fugitive task force seeks absconders from other states. Coronado police said in a statement: . ‘Our thoughts and prayers go out to the brave officers assigned to the . U.S. Marshall’s fugitive task force who were wounded in a shootout with . suspected child molester Charles Mozdir in New York this morning. 'Mozdir . was wanted in a 2012 child molest case in Coronado. He failed to appear . in court on the charges and a $1 million warrant was issued.’ Mozdir allegedly molested a young boy . whose parents were friends of his while he served as a babysitter in . June 2012, reported CNN in The Hunt. He molested the boy while his mother slept in bed next to him, his father told CNN. Child pornography was recovered at Mozdir's home, U.S. Marshals Service deputy Brian Grimes told CNN. Police walk near where two U.S. Marshals and one New York Police Department (NYPD) detective were shot in the afternoon along a quiet street on July 28, 2014 in the West Village of Manhattan, New York City . Mayor Bill de Blasio said the three officers are stable and that, 'We pray everything we are hearing is true and that these officers will be OK in the long run' Mozdir was later arrested and made bail, he then skipped an arraignment and went on the run. Mozdir allegedly molested a second boy in a similar incident, the channel said. Mozdir's scent was found by a hound on a highway and his car was recovered in Georgia, but investigators were unable to find the alleged child molester, CNN said. In 2013 , authorities said ‘Mozdir made threats to take his own life and threats have been made to the victim’s family.’ The violence recalls a deadly shootout that left a gunman and two auxiliary New York City police officers dead on another Greenwich Village street in March 2007. That gunman, David Garvin, killed a bartender, according to police, and then turned crowded streets packed with storied taverns into a shooting gallery. Unarmed volunteer officers Eugene Marshalik and Nicholas Todd Pekearo were killed.

"Fined: Swedish businessman Anders Wiklof was caught doing 77kph in a 50kph zone . A motorist was handed an eye-watering £80,000 fine for speeding by police - because he is rich. Swedish businessman Anders Wiklof was caught doing 77kph in a 50kph zone while driving in Finland. And the Scandinavian country penalises speeding motorists by fining them based on their wealth, meaning multi-millionaire Wiklof was hit with a hefty free. Traffic cops gave the fast-moving magnate a speeding ticket following the incident on the island of Aland. It is thought the fine handed out to Mr Wiklof, 67, is one of the highest ever. The businessman and philanthropist accepted he was wrong for speeding. But he said in an interview that the penalty was 'unreasonable'. He said: 'I'd rather put that money on the elderly, health, day care or whatever. 'I have only myself to blame, but one can question whether it is fair. Bank balance fine: Sweden penalises speeding motorists by fining them based on their wealth . 'Should I drive too fast in Sweden, I would have received 4000 crowns (£385) in fines and there is a huge difference. 'There should be a ceiling, it would be more fair. Where to put it I do not know, but as it is now, it is unreasonable.' Mr Wiklof made his fortune as the owner of a holding company in Sweden. He is one of the most influential and rich people in Aland, a Swedish-speaking region of Finland.

"Accused: Chicago receiver Sam Hurd . Chicago Bears wide receiver Sam Hurd has been arrested after allegedly trying to buy over a pound of cocaine. The 26-year-old NFL star was held in an undercover drug operation by Homeland Security as he left a restaurant after dining on a $300 fillet mignon steak. Police suspect he is one of the top dealers in Chicago and reportedly have a list of players they claim he supplied with illegal drugs. The list is 'in  the double-digits,'  unnamed law enforcement sources told the radio station 670 The Score. Hurd will be in federal custody until today while prosecutors and defense attorneys work out bail details before he is sent to Texas to face charges. “Sam intends to fight these charges, and . we intend to defend him fully... we have complete confidence in him,' said attorney David Kenner, who successfully defended rapper Snoop . Dogg against a murder charge. Hurd, in handcuffs, declined to comment on the charges, but when he was asked before the hearing if he was still a member of the Bears, he said: 'As far as I know.' According to the criminal complaint, Hurd met an undercover agent at Morton’s steak restaurant near Chicago's O'Hare airport. In action: Hurd leaves one of the Green Bay Packers on the ground during the match last September . He allegedly told the agent that he was interested in buying five to 10 kilograms of cocaine and 1,000 pounds of marijuana weekly to distribute in the Chicago area. The agent claimed Hurd said that he and another person were already distributing approximately four kilos of cocaine weekly, but needed a new supplier that could meet their demand. While his partner handled most of their drug deals, Hurd allegedly told the agent he was responsible for the 'higher-end deals.' Hurd left the meeting with the . undercover officer after he agreed to pay $25,000 for each kilo of . cocaine and $450 per pound of marijuana. He said that he could pay for a kilo of cocaine after 'he gets out of practice.' The player then walked out of the restaurant and was arrested by Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers as he stashed the bag of cocaine in his vehicle. Kathy Colvin, a spokesman for the U.S. Attorney in Dallas, told ABC News that she 'cannot confirm or deny' allegations that Hurd sold drugs to other NFL players. But she added that It was possible these charges could come up later. Hurd spent five seasons with the Dallas Cowboys before signing a $5.15 million three-year deal with the Bears in July. Bears Coach Lovie Smith said he was disappointed by the arrest, and described it as 'total surprise.'",Police list of NFL players they claim he has supplied .
"Brits fighting in Syria face being charged with terrorist offences when they return home under new laws to limit the threat of attack in the UK. David Cameron and Nick Clegg said they wanted to ensure ‘peace of mind for all that live here’ as they unveiled a raft of new laws in the Queen’s Speech aimed at criminal gangs, people traffickers and child abusers. The new laws would allow people suspected of committing terror offences overseas to be prosecuted in the UK as if the offences occurred on British soil. The government warned Syria is now a 'breeding ground for terrorists’ after senior Whitehall officials said jihadists returning from fighting in the bloody civil war pose the biggest risk to UK security since 9/11. Free Syrian Army fighters fire a rocket towards forces loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. Under new laws announced in the Queen's Speech, fighters returning to Britain could be charged with terror offences . Government sources suggest around 2,000 Europeans fighting in Syria, including at least 200 already known to the British security services. It is feared that fighters returning to the UK will seek to radicalise young men in particular to launch terror attacks at home and abroad. Tackling the problem has become a top priority for MI5, MI6 and counter-terror police. In today’s State Opening of Parliament, the Queen announced details of a new Serious Crime Bill to ‘tackle child neglect, disrupt serious organised crime and strengthen powers to seize the proceeds of crime’. It includes new powers to ‘reduce the potential threat posed by UK citizens and residents returning home after taking part in the Syria conflict’ the government said. Security Minister James Brokenshire said: 'The police and security services are working to detect and disrupt terrorist threats from Syria and will take the strongest possible action to protect our national security. The Serious Crime Bill has been drawn up by Home Secretary Theresa May, pictured walking to listen to the Queen's Speech with Labour's shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna . 'This Bill would extend the reach of the Terrorism Act 2006 so that UK-linked individuals and those who seek to harm UK interests, who travel overseas to prepare or train more generally for terrorism, can be prosecuted as if their actions had taken place in the UK. 'Syria is a dangerous place and the UK advises against all travel to the country. 'Even people travelling for well-intentioned humanitarian reasons are exposing themselves to serious risk, including being targeted for recruitment by terrorist groups. 'The best way to help Syrian people is by donating to UK-registered charities.' Anyone convicted of preparation of terrorist acts abroad can be jailed for life, while a conviction for training for terrorism currently carries a maximum sentence of 10 years in prison, under the Terrorism Act 2006. Foreign Secretary William Hague has previously warned that the number of UK fighters returning from Syria of ‘serious concern’. In February Charles Farr, the head of the Office for Security and Counter-Terrorism, said the work of the security services would be dominated by the fall-out of the  Syrian conflict for a long time to come. He added: ‘Syria is different from any other counter-terrorism challenge that we have faced since 9/11 — because of the number of terrorist groups now engaged in the fighting, their size and scale, the number of people from this country who are joining them, ease of travel, availability of weapons and the intensity of the conflict. ‘The agencies and many others involved here in counter terrorist work will be occupied with this for the forseeable future.’ The government has warned against any travel to Syria and ministers have the power to strip suspects of their passport or their right to stay in the UK. In today’s speech the Queen added: ‘My ministers will strive to improve the humanitarian situation in Syria, to reduce violence and promote a political settlement.’ The government set out three priorities on Syria: Supporting efforts to find a political solution to the conflict; alleviating humanitarian suffering; and protecting UK security by tackling extremism and getting rid of Assad’s chemical weapons. The government said: Ending the conflict is strongly in our national interest. It poses a growing threat to UK, regional and international peace and security. 'Syria is a dangerous place and the UK advises against all travel to the country' ‘Syria is a breeding ground for terrorists. Eliminating the threat from Assad’s chemical weapons will benefit us all. 'The world also continues to bear the financial costs of the conflict as we attempt to alleviate the intense humanitarian suffering.’ The Serious Crime Bill also includes a US-style anti-mafia law to prosecute lawyers, accountants and couriers who work for crime lords but currently 'keep their hands clean'. Paedophiles who download manuals on how to groom their victims are to be treated like terrorists who possess bomb making guides under a new offence of 'possessing paedophile manuals'. There will also be tougher laws to tackle sexual exploitation and female genital mutilation, while a Cinderella Law will target parents who starve their children of love and affection. The Serious Crime Bill will tackle child neglect, disrupt organised crime and increase powers to seize the proceeds of crime . The Bill will also extend the reach of the offences in the Female Genital Mutilation Act 2003 so that they apply to habitual as well as permanent UK residents. The aim is to help legal officials to track, disrupt and bring to justice criminals who target vulnerable women and children. Up to 23,000 girls under the age of 15 years could be at risk of female genital mutilation (FGM), also known as female circumcision or female genital cutting, each year and nearly 66,000 women are living with its consequences, according to a study based on 2001 census data in England and Wales. Population growth and immigration from practising countries since 2001 mean the impact could be even greater given that it is often a hidden crime. It is a form of child abuse, largely carried out on children aged between the five and eight years old, which can have devastating physical and psychological consequences for girls and women, the NSPCC notes. Efforts are also being made under the Serious Crime Bill to sharpen the tools that the National Crime Agency (NCA) and other crime fighting organisations have to try and tackle criminals. This includes new powers to seize detain and destroy criminal substances suspected of being used as cutting agents for illegal drugs.","Jihadists returning from fighting in civil war pose 'biggest threat since 9/11'

"A high school community is in shock after three students have committed suicide in just seven weeks. Jordan Halmich, a 16-year-old junior, was the first to take his life on September 28; five weeks later, Donna Cooley, a 15-year-old sophomore, was found hanging in her bedroom. And on Monday night, former cheerleader Destiny Pearson, 16, became the latest student at St Clair High School in St Clair, Missouri to kill herself. Police officers, parents and teachers in the small community are now rallying together to determine what sparked the suicides and to prevent any further tragedies from occurring. Scroll down for video . Suicides: Jordan Halmich, a 16-year-old senior at St Clair High School, took his life on September 28, while Donna Cooley, a 15-year-old sophomore, hanged herself in her bedroom November 2 . Tragic: Sixteen-year-old Destiny Pearson was the most recent victim, killing herself on Monday night . 'Obviously there are a lot of emotional problems with these individuals,' St Clair police chief Bill Hammack  told MailOnline. 'But each case has specific identifiers. 'They are dealing with a lot of . emotional and mental issues and there's not one reason connecting three . different suicides of three different teenagers across three different . jurisdictions.' He added that accusations of bullying had surrounded all three deaths. When Cooley's father found her . hanging in her bedroom at 6.30am on November 2, she had scrawled words . on her mirror, indicating that she had been the victim of bullying. Her parents had also banned her from . using her cell phone and computer as she was failing classes at school, Franklin . County Sheriff Gary Toelke told MailOnline. 'She was upset about a number of things at home and school,' he said. Scene: Three students at St Clair High School in Missouri have killed themselves in seven weeks . Police chief Hammack said that, after interviews with her friends and family, . there was no evidence of bullying, and added that there had also been no evidence that Halmich had been bullied. An investigation into the latest suicide is ongoing, with friends disputing over whether she had been picked on. The school district held an emergency meeting . on Tuesday night at the high school cafeteria to discuss potential problems, but so many people turned up it had to be moved to the school's gym. 'It's hard for me to comprehend that it . even happened, that it's real,' a parent told KDSK. 'You wake up the next morning and you're . hoping it's a dream and it's still not a dream.' Dr. Michael Murphy, the superintendent of the St Clair School district, told KTVI: 'There are individuals here who truly . are needing to deal with crisis and then there are other individuals . here who are truly reaching out to support a community in need.' Popular: Police said there was no evidence Jordan Halmich, pictured with his girlfriend, was bullied . Remembered: Candles were lit and his favourite hat was placed on the ground at a memorial service . He . said out of respect to the victims he would not reveal further details . about their deaths, and there was little apparently connecting the . tragedies. But he added: 'One common thread that I would see that is occurring is that there is social media involved.' 'We've tried to identify potential patterns that existed inside the school setting, outside the school setting,' he said, adding that investigations continue and help is being offered to parents. 'I'm hearing anxiety, concern, . frustration, and rightfully so,' he told KSDK. 'Anxiety and frustration out of . the fact of ""could this have been prevented?"" 'And fear from some parents that don't have the greatest relationship with their child and fear that . their child may consider doing something like this.' There are around 2,300 students in the . school with 750 at the high school. The city of St Clair, which is . around 55 miles southwest of St Louis, has 4,700 residents. Missed: Jordan's girlfriend, Madison Whitworth, posted pictures on Facebook of the couple together . Jordan Halmich, a popular student who enjoyed basketball, fishing and hunting, died just a month before his 17th birthday, leaving behind his parents, two brothers and girlfriend, Madison Whitworth. 'Baby I miss you so much,' she wrote on a memorial Facebook group on the day of his funeral. 'Today was so hard saying good-bye. 'But we still are forever and always like you said today is our nine month anniversary and it is so hard but I love you more than anyone in this world. See you soon babe rest easy.' Cooley, who was nicknamed DJ, ended her life after trouble at home and school, police said. Her father went to her room to collect his car keys when he found she had hanged herself. 'I'm gonna miss you dearly,' friend Brittanie Shea Kohlbusch wrote on Facebook. 'Your such a sweet beautiful girl and touched the lives of many. its sad that youre gone. 'Im sorry that you dealt with bullying in school, if only they would have known how terrible they made you feel and how much this would impact not only you,but also others who love you dearly.' Fears: School district superintendent Dr Michael Murphy revealed social networking connected the deaths . Shaken: The small community of St Clair is trying to understand what caused the teenagers' deaths . A Facebook memorial group has also been set up for the latest victim, Destiny Pearson, and friends took to the page to dispute claims that she was bullied. Others wrote that Pearson had in fact stood up against bullies for other students. 'I have also known Destiny to stand up for others against bullies!!' Samantha Smith wrote. 'She took up for a lot of her peers. And she stood up for them many of times. 'She had a great heart and will be missed by many! Loved forever. A beautiful soul lost!' Pearson, from Lonedell, was a former cheerleader and part of the school's drama club. She also loved riding horses, karate, sewing, reading and writing, according to her obituary.

"Jailed: Donna Wright, pictured at an earlier court hearing, was given an eight-week prison sentence for harassing the family of missing Katrice Lee . An internet troll who posed as a girl disappeared more than 30 years ago, then harassed her distraught family, has been jailed. Donna Wright, 34, pretended to be Katrice Lee, who vanished in Germany in 1981 aged two. But when a DNA test proved that she wasn't her, she started harassing Katrice's parents over Facebook and by telephone. But even after a court banned her last year from contacting the family she persistently called them and hurled abuse down the telephone. Wright, from West Cornforth in County Durham, was given an eight-week jail sentence after admitting harassment against Katrice's father Richard Lee, 64. She will serve a total of 14 weeks behind bars on account of a suspended sentence she was given at the previous hearing in 2013, where she was convicted of harassing the missing girl's mother Sharon and her sister Natasha. Katrice vanished from an army-run supply store in Paderborn, West Germany on November 28, 1981, her second birthday. Her father, her second birthday while on a shopping trip for party supplies. Her father, a soldier with the King's Royal Hussars, was stationed nearby at the time, and her family headed out  the busy Naafi store, where she vanished in the crowds. Wright, who is the same age as Katrice would be now, first answered an appeal for information in 2012. Newton Aycliffe Magistrates’ Court . previously heard Wright turned nasty after a DNA test proved she was not . the missing girl, and sent spiteful messages over Facebook. But after eight court hearings and sacking her solicitor, Wright admitted harassing 64-year-old Mr Lee, from Hartlepool, after conclusive phone records were produced. Harassed: Richard Lee, pictured above with a photo of his daughter, told the court how 'despicable' Wright bombarded him with abuse over the telephone . Vicky Wilson, prosecuting, told the court: 'Donna Wright called Mr Lee on the landline . phone on December 1. On the first occasion she hung up. 'On the next occasion she said, ""Are you Mr Lee, the father of Katrice?"" She said to Mr Lee on the phone, why he had put a picture of an 11-year-old on Facebook. 'It was in fact she who had put a picture of her 11-year-old daughter on Facebook saying it was Katrice. Mr Lee told her the phone call would be traced and that he knew who she was. 'She replied with some abusive language, before hanging up. She then persisted to try to call him again through the night.' Missing: Katrice Lee, pictured, vanished from an army-run supply store in Germany in 1981 . In an impact statement read to the court, Mr Lee described Wright's actions as 'despicable'. He said: 'If I could ask you to walk in my shoes for just one day, as I have walked the last 32 years . then maybe, just maybe, you can understand the depth of feeling I have towards this individual. 'To be targeted by Ms Wright, who I have to say I have found to be a thoroughly nasty and evil person, has magnified this ordeal. 'To ignore the judge is disrespectful. To seek my telephone number and bombard me with abuse is despicable'. Viv Waugh, defending, added: 'She has to accept that what has happened is unfortunate to say the least. When the matter was before you last year the diagnosis for Ms Wright suggested clear mental health issues. 'I would ask you to take a view that there are exceptional circumstances in this case. If custodial sentence was given over eight weeks she would lose her sheltered accommodation and her support workers.' Sentencing Weight, Judge Martin Walker told her: 'The contact you made was hurtful and caused distress. It was abusive and aggressive.' Speaking after the verdict, Mr Lee said she was a sick individual and had wasted public money. 'The only justice I have got out of it is I will sleep easy in the coming weeks as I won’t have to worry that she will ring me,' he said. He said the family was already serving a life sentence due to the fact their daughter was abducted and they have no answers, and that Wright’s campaign against them had distracted his family from their aim of finding his daughter. Katrice . Lee went missing as her mother was buying crisps at a shop near an Army . base in Paderborn, Germany, where her father was stationed with the . King's Royal Hussars. It was Katrice's birthday and the family went to a nearby NAAFI to purchase items for a party to mark the occasion. The youngster and her mother were at the check out when Mrs Lee briefly went to get some crisps.But when she returned, Katrice had vanished. At . the time, police believed Katrice had fallen into the nearby River . Lippe and drowned, but despite searches a body was never found. Officers reopened the case in 2000 after they created a computer-generated image of how she could now look. Her . story later appeared on the BBC's Missing Live programme during which a . digitial recreation was used to show what she could look like as a . 29-year-old. Katrice's older sister Natasha later appeared on Crimewatch to highlight the appeal. Believing she was snatched, her parents – who divorced 20 years ago – later set up a Facebook page dedicated to finding her.","Donna Wright, 34, pretended to be Katrice Lee, who went missing in 1981 .

"Yeovil manager Gary Johnson had been strict beforehand in making sure his players didn't pose for any selfies with the visiting Manchester United superstars but they were allowed to grab a souvenir afterwards. Captain Joseph Edwards, a United fan, revealed he had exchanged shirts with Wayne Rooney at the end. Yeovil captain Joseph Edwards (right) walks off with Wayne Rooney's (centre) shirt at Huish Park . It was a miserable afternoon for United misfit Anderson, who was named in Louis van Gaal's squad for the first time since the goalless draw at Burnley on August 30. His reward was to spend the entire afternoon sat freezing in the cramped away dug-out. Surely his Old Trafford career is over? The matchday programme was a glossy 96-page tome, which was a worthy souvenir of the occasion. The back four pages were left blank and labelled 'autographs'. You would have been hard pressed to get any beforehand, with a throng 20-deep waiting for United's team coach to arrive. Two programme sellers show off the glossy 96-page special produced for the visit of Manchester United . This was the third FA Cup clash between Yeovil and Manchester United, and United’s 2-0 victory made it a hat-trick of wins over the Somerset club. The aggregate score now stands at 13-0 following a 3-0 victory at Old Trafford in January 1938 and an 8-0 romp in February 1949 at Maine Road (after Old Trafford had suffered bomb damage in the war). Jack Rowley scored five for Matt Busby’s men in the latter game. There was a gruesome moment 20 minutes in when United's medical staff got out their stapler to repair damage to Paddy McNair after the defender clashed heads with Yeovil striker Kieffer Moore.

"A book claiming to be the world's first 'gay bible' has been published to coincide with the debate on same-sex marriage. Titled the 'Queen James Bible', its editors claim that it is a re-working of the King James Bible translated in a way that 'prevents homophobic misinterpretation of God's Word'. 'Homosexuality was first overtly . mentioned in the Bible in 1946 in the Revised Standard Version. There is . no mention of or reference to homosexuality in any Bible prior to this – . only interpretations have been made', the book's official website said. Genesis 19:5 (King James)'And they called unto Lot, and  said unto him, Where are the  men which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us,  that we may know them.' Genesis 19:5 (Queen James)'And they called unto Lot, and said unto him, Where are the men which came in to thee this night? Bring them out unto us, that we may rape and humiliate them' Timothy 1:10 (King James)'For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves with mankind, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine' Timothy 1:10 (Queen James)'For whoremongers, for them that defile themselves, for menstealers, for liars, for perjured persons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to sound doctrine' Jude 1:7 (King James)''Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the . cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, . and going after strange flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering . the vengeance of eternal fire' Jude 1:7 (Queen James)'Even as Sodom and Gomorrha, and the cities about them in like manner, giving themselves over to fornication, and going after nonhuman flesh, are set forth for an example, suffering the vengeance of eternal fire' The publication, printed and bound . in the U.S. is timed to coincide with the current debate . over same-sex marriage. The sales pitch on the website says: 'You can’t choose your sexuality, but you can choose Jesus. Now you can choose a Bible, too'. The . book is on sale online but does not advertise its origins, with no specific publisher, editor or . translator listed by name on it's offical website. 'God' is listed as . the author and 'Jesus Christ' a contributor. Douglas J. Moo, Wessner Chair of . Biblical Studies at Wheaton College and a professional Bible translator, . told The Christian Post that the Queen James editors' assessment of . past translations is not entirely accurate. 'Few, . if any English translations use the actual words 'homosexuality' or . 'homosexual.' But the history of English translation shows that versions . have consistently used other language to refer to what we would call . homosexual relationships', said Mr Moo. 'For instance, the King James Version . of Romans 1:27 refers to 'men, leaving the natural use of the woman, . burned in their lust one toward another; men with men working that which . is unseemly. 'It would be very difficult to deny that this language, . and the language found in many other places in both the OT and the NT, . refers to homosexuality.' A Vicar in New Zealand, meanwhile, has caused outrage by putting up a poster outside his church in Auckland, New Zealand, that claims Jesus was gay. 'It's . Christmas. Time for Jesus to come out', the sign proclaims, with an . image of baby Jesus as a toddler in a manger, surrounded by a rainbow . halo. Reverend Glynn Cardy of St Matthew in the City church, said that, as homosexuality was not a word until the . 1800s, any mention of it in the Bible or other documents would have mistranslations. He points out that there is no indication about Jesus's sexuality: 'The fact is we don't know what his sexual orientation was.' His attempts at challenging the status quo were defended by fellow Reverend Clay . Nelson who said the billboard tried to humanise Jesus by getting people to think about the challenges he would have had growing up. He added: 'Some . scholars have tried to make the case that he might have been gay. 'But it is all conjecture. Maybe gay, maybe not. Does it . matter? 'There is almost nothing in . the record of his teachings about sexuality while there is plenty about . the perils of being rich. Certainly he always supported the marginalised . in society.' Raising eyebrows: The poster is getting attention - and criticisms - from those who see it . Special night: Captain Matthew Phelps proposes to partner Ben Schock inside the White Hosue . U.S. Marine Corps captain Matthew Phelps made history this weekend by proposing to his partner Ben Schock inside the White House.

"A victim abused by Rotherham paedophiles who also murdered her sister has today confronted embattled police chief Shaun Wright and demanded his resignation. Sarah Wilson, who was abused by Asian attackers for five years from the age of 11, berated the man at the centre of the child sex scandal for refusing the leave his £85,000-a-year job. Miss Wilson's younger sister, Laura, died in the UK's first white honour killing carried out by an Asian boyfriend. She was 17 when she was stabbed and dumped in a canal by killer Ashtiaq Ashgar. From the public gallery at a meeting in Rotherham today Sarah Wilson, who has waived her right to anonymity, yelled at the South Yorkshire Police and Crime Commissioner: 'You let my sister be murdered, you let us be groomed. You should be out or dead.’ Scroll down for video . Fury: Rotherham child abuse victim Sarah Wilson, who sister Laura was murdered by a member of an Asian paedophile ring, confronted South Yorkshire police chief Shaun Wright and demanded he resigns . Victim: Miss Wilson, who was abused from the age of 11 yelled: ''You let my sister be murdered, you let us be groomed. You should be out or dead.’ Before being elected South Yorkshire PCC in 2012, Mr Wright was Rotherham’s councillor in charge of children’s services for five years. The department repeatedly turned a blind eye to evidence that 1,400 girls had fallen into the clutches of paedophiles from 1997 to last year. Defence: Shaun Wright said that his record PCC 'speaks for itself' and would not resign . From 11 Sarah Wilson was plied with alcohol and cannabis by sexual predators who habitually abused her until she was 16, when they lost interest because she was no longer underage, she said. Having now turned her life around she waived her right to anonymity to  persuade other victims to come forward. Speaking to Shaun Wright directly Miss Wilson, who was joined by other victims: 'Alarm bells were ringing since I was 11-years-old and not at one time did I get offered any support from social services or the police. 'How can you sit there and deny everything you’ve done? How can you do it? What about all those families? You’ve done nothing to support us. Nothing'. She added: 'I’ve had to live with this for 12 years and what have you done? You’ve still got your job.' To Mr Wright directly, again, she said: 'You can’t even look me in the face, can you? Stand down'. Responding to taunts he said: 'The young ladies in the public gallery, without a shadow of a doubt, have been let down and they deserve every course of support and every course of justice.' He added: 'My record in tackling child sexual exploitation as PCC (Police and Crime Commissioner) speaks for itself.' At today's meeting Mr Wright was also confronted by the grandfather of one of the at least 1,400 children abused by gangs, mainly of Pakistani origin. Speaking from the public gallery, the man said his 12-year-old granddaughter was arrested for being drunk and disorderly by police officers who let her four adult abusers go free. The man said: 'You were a disgrace, mate. If I had a gun I would shoot you.' Under pressure: Mr Wright has repeatedly harangued during a meeting today and left with help from police officers . Mr Wright responded, saying: 'Clearly, if that took place, it's an absolute disgrace.' The PCC faced angry scenes at the meeting in Rotherham Town Hall as members of the public asked why he was still in his job. Mr Wright has resisted widespread and repeated top-level calls for him to resign since the publication of the Jay Report into child sexual exploitation (CSE) in Rotherham, which detailed how at least 1,400 children were subjected to horrors including rape, violence and trafficking for sex between 1997 and 2013. Before his election in 2012, he was a councillor in Rotherham for more than a decade and was the member of the council with responsibility for children's services from 2005 to 2010. Calls for him to step down have been led by Prime Minister David Cameron, Home Secretary Theresa May, and Labour leader Ed Miliband. But he has resisted every challenge and when Labour threatened to throw him out of the party, he resigned his membership. Today, chairman Harry Harpham said the panel had passed a vote of no confidence in the commissioner and endorsed calls made by the Home Affairs Select Committee for emergency legislation to change the law to enable PCCs to be sacked in 'exceptional circumstances'. One member of the panel, Ukip's Caven Vines, resigned on the spot saying he could not bear to be in the same room as Mr Wright any more. The chairman also revealed he had received two official complaints about Mr Wright which he had passed on to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). Before he left, Mr Wright told the panel that child sexual exploitation levels were just as high now as they were in the periods covered by the Jay Report. The commissioner agreed this was on an 'industrial scale'. He told the panel: 'It's a very difficult and complex issue to prevent. That shouldn't be any excuse for not trying to prevent it. 'But I'm afraid it is still going on today, it's just as prevalent today as it was in 2010 or 2005 or indeed any period before that. 'All I can say is that you've got my absolute commitment to continue the work that's already been put in place and to try and continue the progress that has been made since I've been police and crime commissioner.' Laura Wilson, 17, was murdered by her Asian boyfriend in the UK's first white honour killing . Laura Wilson, from Rotherham, was 17 when she was stabbed and dumped in a canal by her Asian boyfriend in the UK's first white honour killing. Ashtiaq Ashgar, who Laura's family believe was using her for sex, murdered Laura in 2010 after she told his family about their secret relationship. The teenager was left to die in a canal, after being stabbed more than 40 times, mostly to the head. After Laura's death, it was revealed that social workers had known for six years that the white teenage mother was at clear risk from predatory Asian gangs. They had received information about certain adults who were suspected of targeting Laura from the age of 11. Laura began her relationship with Ashgar in 2008, when she was 15 and he was 16. Ashgar came from a traditional Muslim family who were planning an arranged marriage for their son with a girl from Pakistan. But unbeknown to his family, he lived a double life where he drank, smoked cannabis, carried weapons and had numerous relationship with women, including Laura. When Laura found out that he has been seeing other girls, they broke up and she slept with this married friend, 22-year-old Ishaq 'Zac' Hussein, to make him jealous. Just 16 at the time, Laura fell pregnant and had a daughter, Alicia. Hussein refused to acknowledge he was the father. After Alicia was born, Laura and Ashgar rekindled their relationship. But he insisted it must be a secret. Laura soon became sick of being Ashgar's secret and on October 6, 2010, she and her sister Sarah made the fatal mistake of revealing all to his family. The teenager was left to die in a canal in Rotherham, after being stabbed more than 40 times . Laura and Sarah also visited Zac's family to reveal how he is the father of her baby. After that, Ashgar sent Zac a text message saying: 'I'm gonna send that b***** to Hell.' He also said he wanted to make 'beans on toast' of her, which is a phrase that means to spill blood. Ashtiaq Ashgar, who was 18 at the time, is serving a life sentence for Laura's murder . Ashgar then asked Laura to meet him at the canal one evening where he murdered her. Both Ashgar and Hussein were charged with murder. Ashgar pleaded guilty and was given a life sentence. He will be eligible for parole in 2029 when he is 34. Hussein was acquitted of murder following a retrial. Laura's mother now looks after Laura’s daughter. In 2012, the council’s Safeguarding Children Board published a serious case review about Laura's death. But key passages which reveal they knew she was at particular risk from ‘Asian men’ had been blocked out with black lines. The council went to court in an attempt to try to suppress the hidden information after a uncensored copy was leaked to the Times newspaper, but they abandoned legal action. The uncensored report confirms that Laura, identified as Child S, had dealings with 15 agencies. The report identified ‘numerous missed opportunities’ to protect her and it states that she eventually became ‘almost invisible’ to care professionals. The hidden information included the knowledge that, at the age of 13, Laura and a friend had been given alcohol by men at a takeaway who then asked what she would give them in return. She had also been referred to a child sexual exploitation project just three months after her 11th birthday. Another censored passage reveals that Laura had been ‘mentioned’ during a 2009 police inquiry that eventually led to the conviction of five Pakistani men for sex offences against three underage girls.","Sarah Wilson was abused by Asian attackers for five years from age of 11 .

"Gay marriage is set to be allowed in churches and other religious buildings, it emerged Friday.The Government will reveal plans next week to allow faith groups in England and Wales to 'opt in' if they want to host same-sex weddings. The move is a dramatic extension of the Coalition’s plans to allow same-sex couples to marry in civil ceremonies. The proposal to legalise gay marriage has been fiercely opposed by some senior church figures and scores of Tory MPs. Prime Minister David Cameron insisted churches would not be forced to hold gay weddings, while on a visit to Lear Corporation in Redditch, Worcestershire . But that hasn’t stopped David Cameron from supporting it. MPs will have a free vote on a Bill next year. The PM, speaking on a visit to Redditch, Worcestershire, Friday, said: 'Look, I’m in favour of gay marriage because I’m a massive supporter of marriage and I don’t want gay people to be excluded from a great institution. 'But let me be absolutely 100 per cent clear: if there is any church or any synagogue or any mosque that doesn’t want to have a gay marriage, it will not – it absolutely must not – be forced to hold it. 'That is absolutely clear in the legislation. And also let me make clear: this is a free vote for Members of Parliament, but personally I will be supporting it.' The dramatic move has prompted immediate controversy. Anti-reform campaigners said that whatever was intended by the legislation, its introduction would only increase pressure on churches opposed to same-sex ceremonies to perform them. The PM has said that religious groups can choose whether to host same-sex weddings . The Prime Minister took to Twitter to insist religious groups will not be forced to perform gay marriages and Conservatives will not be whipped in the vote next year . Some Tories said the move would 'outrage millions'. Labour leader Ed Miliband has been pushing the Government to extend their plans to allow those religious groups which want to offer gay weddings to do so, as well as civil venues. Nick Clegg is also understood to have been pushing behind the scenes for the legislation, expected to be published in the New Year, to be widened in scope. Mr Clegg said: 'I’m a supporter and always have been of same-sex marriage, because I think marriage is a wonderful thing, a wonderful institution. 'It’s very important to remember that in our plans we’re not going to force any church or any religious denomination to hold same-sex marriage ceremonies if they don’t want to.' The Government has received 228,000 responses to its consultation on allowing gay civil marriage – more than on any other issue. Culture Secretary Maria Miller will set out the plans next week, promising legal 'locks' to protect churches opposed to the idea of gay marriage . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg insisted the government would not force force any church to hold same sex marriage ceremonies if they do not want to . Culture Secretary Maria Miller is . expected to respond to the consultation by setting out the Government’s . plans in detail next week. Sources said the unexpected move was . necessary to make a promised protection from legal challenge for . religious organisations which oppose gay marriage watertight. Government legal advisers claimed . that the opt-in clause was necessary to prevent the European courts . over-ruling any clause in the Bill to protect those who object. But . critics are sceptical that this will make any difference. Civil partnerships, introduced in . 2005, already give gay couples similar legal rights to married couples. But the Government wants them to be legally allowed to make marriage . vows. Ministers have vowed to protect . churches and other religious groups who object, insisting that the . legislation will be framed in a way to address claims from opponents . that they might be forced to conduct gay marriage ceremonies once civil . weddings are allowed because of human rights laws. Last month it emerged that 118 out of . 303 Tory MPs had written to constituents indicating differing degrees . of unease at the policy. Last night another seven joined their ranks. Michael Fallon, the business minister, told the Coalition for Marriage . campaign group he was 'strongly minded' to oppose it and his . constituents were 'overwhelmingly against' changing the law. Several other ministers are among those expected to abstain or vote against in a free vote. Colin Hart, of the Coalition for Marriage, said: 'The decision to press . ahead with the profoundly undemocratic proposals to rewrite the . traditional meaning of marriage is deeply disappointing and regrettable. 'The PM has gone back on his promises . that churches will be protected. The suggestion that by creating an . ""opt in system"" you somehow prevent churches, mosques and synagogues . being sued is risible. This is now made much more likely. 'Any legislation that the PM proposes . will be subject to the European courts, who according to legal experts . will find against the Government and those religious institutions who . end up in the dock. So the PM is writing a cheque that he knows will . bounce.' Former Archbishop of Canterbury Lord Carey added: 'I’m dismayed that the Government is seeking to fast-track this legislation. 'First we had a consultation that was . nothing of the kind and now we have this further attempt to expedite . the legislation for short-term party political advantage. 'We should expect politicians to act . with greater wisdom and statesmanship when contemplating such . far-reaching cultural and social changes.'","Prime Minister gives backing to ceremonies in religious buildings .

"Football Association chairman Greg Dyke says there is 'no basis' for the governing body to intervene in the case of convicted rapist Ched Evans. Evans blamed 'mob rule' for his move to Oldham collapsing on Thursday and for the first time apologised to the woman he was found guilty of raping. However the former Sheffield United striker still maintained his innocence. Shadow sports minister Clive Efford has urged the FA to cancel Evans' playing registration. Dyke, speaking for the first time about the Evans situation, said: 'Rape and sexual violence are abhorrent and unacceptable. This cannot be overstated. Greg Dyke says the FA have no basis to intervene in the Ched Evans case . 'We have reviewed the Ched Evans case in some detail at the FA and we have examined both the legal requirements and our rules and regulations and there is no basis for us to intervene directly in this particular case. 'That said it is important that we continue to look at the issue of behaviour and attitudes within football, and recognise the unique privileges and responsibilities that come with being a participating member of the national game. 'I would encourage the game to consider and discuss this matter and the prospect for future guidelines or codes of conduct. The FA will certainly be considering it in line with our own ongoing review of what constitutes public or private communications and behaviour.' Efford, referring to the Evans case, said: 'He's fresh out of a conviction for rape and there are plenty of professions to which you would not be able to return, in spite of the fact you'd served your sentence, and I think football is one of them. Convicted rapist footballer Ched Evans and girlfriend Natasha Massey leave her parents home on Thursday . 'We cannot send the sort of message that it would to young people, that this man's a rapist and it's okay to hold that position - an exalted position in the minds of many young people in the local community. 'The Football Association have the power to revoke his affiliation to the FA, his registration to be able to play football, and I think they have to look at this.' Evans, 26, said in a statement on Thursday: 'Sadly the 'mob rule' tactics employed by the more radical elements of our society and the constant media reporting has had the desired influence on some sponsors and the club would face significant financial pressure if I joined them. Evans drives away with his girlfriend Natasha before his move to Oldham collapsed . 'The most significant issue for me was that owing to the threat of funding opportunities being withdrawn which may jeopardise the building of Oldham's new stand, it would mean that workers would lose their jobs and others would be put at risk - that would simply not be fair.' Evans was released from prison last October, halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman in 2011. He condemned social media attacks on the woman and for the first time issued an apology while still maintaining his innocence. Oldham Athletic Chief Executive Neil Joy reads out a statement in relation to Ched Evans . His statement added: 'I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. 'Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.' Oldham's chief executive Neil Joy insisted they pulled the plug on a deal following 'vile and abusive threats, including death threats' to fans, sponsors and staff. Greater Manchester Police said, however, that no reports about death threats or other serious threats had been received. It is the second time Oldham have pulled out of a deal to sign the striker, whose chances of finding a team willing to take him on now appear limited.","Greg Dyke says there is no basis for The FA to intervene in the Ched Evans case .

Evans said: 'I am grateful for the support of the PFA in helping me try to return to football and continue my career. 'Upon legal advice, I was told not to discuss the events in question. This silence has been misinterpreted as arrogance and I would like to state that this could not be further from the truth. Evans and girlfriend Natasha leave their home in Cheshire . 'I do remain limited at present by what I can say due to the ongoing referral to the Criminal Cases Review Commission and whilst I continue to maintain my innocence, I wish to make it clear that I wholeheartedly apologise for the effects that night in Rhyl has had on many people, not least the woman concerned. 'Finally, it has been claimed that those using social media in an abusive and vindictive way towards this woman are supporters of mine. I wish to make it clear that these people are not my supporters and I condemn their actions entirely and will continue to do so.' Evans' proposed signing for Oldham has collapsed after the uproar that surrounded the negotiations. Oldham manager Lee Johnson during a training session . It comes just a day after Oldham's joint-owner Simon Corney said there was an '80 per cent' chance of the 26-year-old being signed. Evans was released from prison last October, halfway through a five-year sentence for raping a 19-year-old woman. Corney had said he believes Evans 'has served his time' and said the decision to give the 26-year-old a chance had been agreed unanimously by all six members of the Oldham board - despite vociferous opposition and sponsors severing ties with the League One club. It is the second time the club have pulled out of a deal to sign the striker, whose chances of finding a club willing to take him on now appear limited. The media have been gathered outside Oldham's Boundary Park for much of the week . Sheffield United also decided against giving him a contract after initially agreeing to let him train with the club. Jim McMahon, the leader of Oldham council, confirmed the deal is off and said the issue had caused 'intimidation, abuse and harassment'. McMahon said in a statement: 'I understand Oldham Athletic's move to sign Ched Evans is off. 'I've always believed in rehabilitation but felt that both club and player should have allowed Mr Evans' appeal to run its course before agreeing a contract. As it stands Mr Evans has been found guilty in a court of law and has not yet completed his sentence.

"John Carver looks set to remain in charge of Newcastle United this week, despite the club holding talks with Remi Garde. Magpie officials, led by managing director Lee Charnley and chief scout Graham Carr, spoke with Garde in London over the weekend. However, Sportsmail understands he is not the only candidate for the head coach vacancy at St James' Park. John Carver has been caretaker manager of Newcastle since the departure of Alan Pardew . Former Lyon coach Remi Garde is the favourite to take over as head coach of Newcastle . And there is a suggestion that former Arsenal midfielder Garde, who stepped down as boss of Lyon at the end of last season to take a sabbatical, would prefer to wait until the summer before taking up the role. That is also the case with French compatriot Christophe Galtier, who insists he will not walk out on Saint-Etienne in the middle of the season, especially not with his side having climbed to third in Ligue 1 at the weekend. It means that Carver will almost certainly be in the dugout when Southampton visit Tyneside on Saturday. Pardew steered Crystal Palace to a 2-1 win over Tottenham in his first Premier League game on Saturday . He would be willing to take the reins until the end of the season and would like to remain at the club whatever direction the hierarchy take with their appointment. Garde's situation, meanwhile, is complicated slightly by some of his preferred backroom team still being under contract at Lyon.","Alan Pardew quit as manager of Newcastle United at the end of December .

"A mysterious clown has been showing up in public places across Staten Island for several days and residents of the New York City borough are reacting on social media with everything from laughter to fear to outright anger. The clown has thus far been known to hang out near train stations, in front of bank in broad daylight and behind trees at dusk, where he smiles and slowly waves at passersby while holding little balloons. While the clown hasn't broken any laws, he's caused a ruckus from Staten Islanders who can't help but associate it to the blood-thirsty killer clown of  Stephen King's It. Scroll down for video . Creepy: A mysterious clown has been terrifying residents of Staten Island since nearly two weeks ago . 'I'm driving home from the gym and this is what I see,' wrote Instagram user Robert Privitera with a particularly creepy shot of the yellow-clad clown. 'Guess who ain't sleeping tonight.' The haunting trickster first started cropping up on Staten Islanders' newsfeeds in the last week or two. Last Sunday, comedian Vic Dibitetto posted a video he took of the clown to Facebook. It shows the clown waving and pointing at drivers in broad daylight as they pass a TD Bank drivethru. 'Funny, how?' Dibitetto wondered. Scary either way: The clown's appearances, which are thus far unexplained, come at both night and during broad daylight . Boo! One man posted this photo of the clown as it waved from behind a tree in a residential area . While Dibitetto's experience was creepy, the clown appears to be at his scariest in the dark. Michael Leavy learned this the hard way. 'Ok so I'm a little freaked out right now. I was driving home from Buffalo Wild Wings and saw this waving at me,' wrote Leavy on Instagram after snapping the clown, which appeared from behind a tree. Vincent Innocente also saw the clown at night, near a train station waving to cars as he was caught by their high beams. 'He was just kinda standing there waving,' said the confused Innocente. The . reason behind the bizarre appearance of the Staten Island clown remains . unexplained, but if a similar story from across the Atlantic is any . indication, the man behind the white makeup is little more than a . prankster.

"Why haven’t they been able to defend? Among the many head-scratching aspects of Everton’s season, nothing has baffled more than that particular question. Ultra-reliable last year, with a record that was third best in the Barclays Premier League, this campaign has been miserable; individual errors, combined with a lack of continuity in personnel and consistency in performance, has led to a hole being blown in Everton’s ambitions. During a run of four consecutive defeats – their worst sequence since December 2005 – it led some to ask whether Roberto Martinez should pursue a more prosaic approach. If you don’t concede, you don’t get beaten but Everton have conceded too often and been beaten too frequently. John Stones was imperious in defence for Everton during their 1-1 draw with Manchester City . Everton defender Stones tracks Manchester City playmaker David Silva (right) At this point 12 months ago, they had conceded 19 goals; now the tally is 34. Facing up to one of the most fearsome attacks in Europe, then, you would not have expected much to change but, at long last, we were given a glimpse of those characteristics that have served Everton so well down the years. This was how they should be. The minimum requirement of an Everton team is to ally prodigious hard work with a refusal to be second best and from the early exchanges in this collision with Manchester City, you could see a return to old fashioned values. ‘I thought it was an old-fashioned game with a lot of character and grit,’ Martinez observed. ‘In the first half, I thought we allowed Manchester City too much space but we defended well. We stopped David Silva and Samir Nasri being effective in the areas they can operate really well.’ Martinez wants his defenders to play the ball elegantly out from the back but this crowd also likes to see their defenders doing the basics and in Phil Jagielka and John Stones, Everton had the game’s best pairing at centre-half. Jagielka has not had a campaign to remember but, with Stones back alongside, this was much more like it. Tackles were made, interceptions were read and orders were barked out, as Everton battled to keep City at arms’ length. Stones gets himself between his goalkeeper Joel Robles and Manchester City striker Stevan Jovetic (left) Roberto Martinez's side looked far stronger at the back with Stones in the heart of their defence . Stones, meanwhile, was outstanding. Had you never watched a game of football before and were brought into Goodison with the task of picking out which defender cost £32million, you would have picked out this young man from Barnsley, not Eliaquim Managala. If Managala found it all happening too quickly, Stones – who was being watched by England Under-21 head coach Gareth Southgate – exuded calmness, not least when in the first half he took control of a high ball on his chest, turned into space away and started a move with nonchalance. Most importantly, however, Stones showed he could do the dirty work too. He was the player David Moyes signed as Everton manager two years ago. This performance showed why he could prove to be the perfect parting gift.","John Stones was excellent for Everton against Manchester City .

"Four students in African robes and brandishing fake Kalashnikovs caused widespread panic and hysteria by staging a ‘terror attack’ in a French hospital. The men stormed into the building last night in Saint-Roch hospital in the Riviera city of Nice. Fearing a repeat of the 2012 Al-Qaeda-inspired attack in south France, which left six dead, the building was put on lockdown as patients were evacuated to a different part of the hospital and incoming ambulances were diverted. Panic: The men stormed into the building last night in Saint-Roch hospital in the Riviera city of Nice (file photo) Between 50 to 70 police officers were deployed to hunt down the apparent terrorists, who one witness told local newspaper Nice Matin were carrying what looked like M16 or Kalashnikov assault rifles. Police spent 45 minutes hunting down the men before they were arrested in the corridor, reported French website The Local. That is when they discovered the 'terrorists' were four dental students taking part in a prank. Hospital director Martine Rajzman told AFP: 'The four lads had a dismayed look about them, having suddenly realized the consequences of their actions.' But the consequences of their actions had already proved terrifying for staff and patients. The neighbourhood surrounding the Saint-Roch hospital in the centre of Nice was placed on lockdown by authorities. The students were taken to a local police station after their fake firearms were confiscated. France is on high alert for attacks - earlier this month, two French journalists, Claude Verlon and Ghislaine Dupont of Radio France Internationale, were found dead on the outskirts of the northern town of Kidal after being kidnapped - Al Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb later claimed responsibility. It followed France launching air strikes and sending hundreds of soldiers into Niger's neighbour Mali in January to drive back Al Qaeda rebels, saying they would use the West African country as a base for attacks on the west.

"Arsenal record signing Mesut Ozil is clearly relishing his return for the Gunners ahead of Arsene Wenger's side hosting Stoke at the Emirates on Sunday. The German playmaker, a £42.5million signing from Real Madrid in 2013, picked up an injury against Chelsea in October and returns to the Arsenal squad along with Aaron Ramsey, Mathieu Flamini and Olivier Giroud.

'They are a very physical team with good players,' Cazorla told Arsenal.com. 'Set-pieces and the second ball will always be dangerous for us. We need to focus on our game. '[The 3-2 defeat] was strange because we were losing 1-0 in the first 30 seconds and we can't do that.

'He is an exceptional football player,' said the Arsenal manager. 'He always gives you continuity in your game. He's a very creative player and ideally you want all your best players available. 'The advantage of these players - for example Giroud, Koscielny, Debuchy, Ozil - at the moment where most of the players in the league have played 26 or 27 games in their legs, they have four or five.

"The nation's knees are crumbling under the strain of the obesity crisis, MailOnline can reveal. Almost 9,500 people classed as obese, including two teenagers, underwent knee replacement surgery last year, at a cost of more than £50million. The numbers have surged by 150 per cent in just four years, and raise fresh concerns about the extraordinary cost to the NHS of dealing with expanding waistlines. Scroll down for video . Almost 9,500 people had knee replacement surgery last year because their joints could not cope with their weight, at a cost of more than £50million to the NHS . Shocking new figures lays bare the impact on the NHS of the unexpected implications of children and adults becoming so fat their body cannot carry them any more. Obesity costs the NHS £5.1 billion each year with 40,000 people dying as a result of being overweight or obese. Now it can be revealed that one in 10 patients given new knees is obese, up from one in 20 just four years ago. In 2009-10, there were 3,787 operations carried out in England and Wales where obesity was listed as a main or secondary diagnosis. But by 2012-13, the number had leapt to 9,438, figures compiled for MailOnline by the Health and Social Care Information Centre (HSCIC) reveal. Over the last four years there have been a total of 28,000 knee replacements operations carried out on people who were obese. It includes one boy aged between 10 and 14 who went under the knife in 2010-11. Also in the last four years, knee replacements have been carried out on two boys and two girls aged 15-19. Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the health select committee, said: ‘Obesity isn’t a disability, it causes disability. Because of the rise in obesity we are going to see a rise in avoidable disability. ‘The thing we should be worrying about is we are not tackling it at an early enough stage. ‘We should be focussing our effort on stopping people getting there in the first place. 'This is just the opening salvo of something that is going to get worse over the coming decades.’ Data compiled for MailOnline shows how the number of knee operations for obese patients has soared from 3,787 in 2009-10 to 9,438 in 2012-13 . The bulk of knee operations are carried out on people aged 60+, but in the last four years there has been a three-fold increase in knee replacements among obese under-40s . Tory MP Sarah Wollaston, chairman of the health select committee, warned the problem would only get worse unless urgent action was taken to prevent obesity causing increased disabilities . A knee replacement costs around £5,500, meaning the bill for last year alone could have topped £52million. The NHS says a replacement knee will last for around 15 to 20 years if it is 'not put under too much strain', raising the prospect of the same people undergoing repeated surgery throughout their lives. Official guidance suggests that most knee operations are offered for arthritis, with the over-65s most likely need treatment. However, a quarter of those classed as obese who had knee operations were under 60. There has been a three-fold increase in knee replacements among the under-40s. In the last year alone nine people in their twenties and 70 thirty-somethings have had knee operations after becoming obese. Women are almost twice as likely as men to need treatment. Of the 9,438 operations last year, almost 6,000 were for female patients. Tam Fry, from the National Obesity Forum, said: ‘These figures will continue to rise. The human body has evolved for perfection and the knees and the legs and arms and all the bones fit together beautifully. ‘What we have done over the last 50 years to an incredible degree is upset the balance of evolution. 'We are now putting our bones under huge extra burdens which the human body was never designed for. ‘What’s disastrous is people don’t know of the medical problems which are attached to obesity.’ A knee replacement is classed as ‘major surgery’ by the NHS and is only offered after other treatments, such as physiotherapy or steroid injections have failed to help. Last year one in 10 patients given new knees was obese, up from one in 20 just four years ago . The Department of Health warned obesity affects all age groups and ‘there is no magic bullet to solve the problem’. A spokesman said: ‘It is going to take continued effort from all of us; Government, local communities, industry and individuals to reverse this trend. ‘Our primary responsibility is to help the nation to be healthier. This is why we are working with industry, through the Responsibility Deal, to reduce calories in food and drinks to ensure that healthier options are available. ‘We also have a voluntary front of pack labelling scheme which will help people keep track of what they're eating and give them the information to make healthier choices. ‘Everyone over the age of 40 can have a free NHS health check to spot the warning signs of long-term illness- more people are taking them up than ever before. 'And for the first time we have given local authorities the power and over £5 billion in funding to tackle public health issues in their areas.’ This month it was announced free weight-loss surgery could be offered to nearly a million diabetes patients. The health watchdog NICE called for more obese people with the condition to be considered for a gastric band or bypass. At a stroke, the ruling doubled to 1.8million the numbers qualifying for taxpayer-funded surgery.","EXCLUSIVE: Almost 9,500 people classed as obese given  knee replacements .

"Marseille extended their winning streak to eight games with a 2-0 home win against Toulouse in Ligue 1 on Sunday, but not before manager Marcelo Bielsa sat on a scalding hot cup of coffee. There were laughs all round when Bielsa, widely regarded as the man who has transformed Marseille into an exciting team, accidentally sat on the coffee perched on an icebox near the touchline. It had looked like one of the Argentine's coaches had put the cup down on the cooler, and the boss instantly jumped up before angrily turning to his bench and kicking the cup away.

They lead arch-rivals Paris Saint-Germain by seven points after the champions beat RC Lens 3-1 on Friday. Bordeaux are third, also on 18 points, after being held to a 1-1 home draw by strugglers Caen on Sunday. The Argentine soon realised what was on his seat, before he jumped up and turned to his bench . Marseille have conceded only three goals in those eight matches. 'There was a lot of fatigue after the international games but everybody wanted that win,' Gignac, who has scored 10 goals in as many games, told the club website. Nkoulou shouldered the ball into the net from Dimitri Payet's curled cross after 20 minutes. Florian Thauvin came close to doubling the tally two minutes later but his low left-foot strike went just wide.

"Bob Peeters had wanted an FA Cup run to galvanise his struggling Charlton side, so this defeat will only heap further worry on a club going backwards. The Addicks had started the season looking as if they’d be challenging the Championship’s top six but appear more likely to become embroiled in a dogfight at the bottom should this winless run stretch much longer than its current eight games. Even the floodlights packed up on the hosts, suspending the first half for 10 minutes and the manager saw Yoni Buyens meekly sent off for a second booking which summed up another dour afternoon.

Going with what is close to their best XI, Charlton lacked ideas or invention against a Blackburn team who maximised their squad depth with seven changes. The league is much more important for Gary Bowyer - he has designs of the play-offs - but it was the visitors who meant business and were ahead inside four minutes. Craig Conway teased down the left and floated a cross towards Chris Taylor, starting his first game since September, to head beyond Neil Etheridge. They should have been out of sight long before this was eventually over. Chris Brown, all alone at the back post, could only head straight at the goalkeeper, while Conway skewed wide when it was easier to score. It had all the hallmarks of a game between two Championship sides suffering for form and was - for the majority - a rather rank affair. But this third round clash was lit up by a moment of invention from the lively Johann Gudmundsson who - standing over a dead ball 30 yards out - spotted Simon Eastwood too far across his line and wonderfully beat the goalkeeper at the near post. Charlton were level for just four minutes though. Taylor got his second, but was indebted to the team move preceding it. The imperious David Dunn jinked in midfield, keeping hold of possession, before Liam Williamson knocked a super through-ball into Brown’s path and he found Taylor to thunder in. There was time for Tom Cairney to rattle the bar late on, but this was done well before then. Yoni Buyens (centre) is given his marching orders by referee Kevin Stroud after fouling Craig Conway .

While neither claiming nor denying responsibility, Hamas has commented that abductions were a justified response to the plight of thousands of Palestinians - many of them children - held in Israel.

It appeals to Israelis to eliminate 'terrorists' until the teenagers are found, the International Business Times reports. It . has ruled the Gaza strip since winning a decisive majority in elections . in 2007, but the rival Fatah movement retained control of the West . Bank. The two parties remained at odds until a recent reconciliation led . to the swearing in of a Palestinian unity government last week. Israeli . newspaper pundits said Israel was using the opportunity of the . kidnapping to bring about the collapse of the newly-formed unity . government, which has been furiously denounced by Netanyahu. Writing in the top-selling Yediot Aharonot, Alex Fishman said the kidnapping had created a 'one-time operational opportunity' which Israel would use 'to castrate' Hamas and suppress its 'strongholds in Palestinian Authority territory to the greatest extent possible.' By crushing Hamas's infrastructure, it would weaken the movement ahead of Palestinian elections which under the unity deal are supposed to take place before the end of the year, Fishman said. 'Removing the political leadership from the West Bank is supposed to weaken Hamas in advance of the Palestinian presidential elections,' he said. Writing in Haaretz, Amos Harel agreed. 'The purpose of the Israeli actions ... is to drive a wedge between the Palestinian Authority and Hamas, and stop the reconciliation process that began some two months ago,' he wrote. But as the manhunt entered its fifth day, commentators voiced concern about growing reports of violence around the West Bank, sparking fears that an already tense situation could rapidly escalate.","Troops sweep through West Bank towns and cities as they continue search .

"A four-year-old girl has become an ambassador for a new campaign - to help cure children like her who are robbed of the chance of growing up. Aimee Lloyd has Retts Syndrome - a rare brain condition which affects only girls, slows down growth and reverses development. It most often strikes youngsters just after they have learned to walk and say a few words and starts dragging their progression backwards. Over time they lose their new skills and are left  unable to communicate or use their . hands to hold, carry or manipulate  objects. Progressive condition: Aimee appeared to be a happy, healthy baby (left) but her parents became concerned when her development went into reverse. She was diagnosed with Rett's syndrome . Although most reach adulthood they lose their motor control essentially locking them into their bodies. Currently there is no cure for this cruel disease but Aimee's mother Jill, 36, has started a major fundraising campaign for research into the illness. She hopes a breakthrough will come in the next 10 years. It is believed that Rett’s syndrome . may possibly be the first reversible brain condition as symptoms have . been successfully reserved in animals. Presently Aimee is not able to . sit unaided, speak or walk. Jill, who runs a sandwich shop in Preston, said: 'It is basically a break-down of . communication between her brain and her body. She also has no control . over her hands - she’s constantly wringing them. 'There’s some fantastic research going . on, especially the work of Professor Adrian Bird, who successfully . reversed the syndrome in mice. We are hoping and praying every day they . are one step closer to finding a cure. We’re not giving up hope.' Aimee pictured with her brother Daniel and parents Justin and Jill. Rett's only affects girls and is caused by a mutation of a gene in the X chromosome . Jill, who also has a son called Daniel, 7, said the youngster was diagnosed just before her second birthday. Jill and Aimee’s dad, Justin Lloyd, 37, had alerted doctors after noticing slow development. 'Everything was normal during pregnancy,' she said. 'Daniel was six-and-a-half weeks early, so we thought she may come along early too, so they had me on steroids to build me up and she was just two weeks early. 'Everything was perfectly normal until her first birthday, she was a bubbly, happy baby who would wriggle around. The only thing was that she wasn’t sitting up on her own yet, but doctor said she would eventually catch up.' But a few months later Aimee got a chest infection for a couple of weeks and during this time Aimee deteriorated significantly. 'She stopped doing everything she had done, so she would just lie there not moving. She was very placid; relatives said she was too good. Before she had been giggling and moving about. I thought she was maybe just weak, but I eventually took her to the GP,' she said. Aimee was referred to Preston Royal hospital where Aimee’s muscle tone and bloods were tested.An MRI scan was also carried out, which came back clear, but doctors wanted to see Aimee again on receiving the results of her bloods. Aimee with her brother Daniel in 2008 (left) and the siblings together today. Aimee will never talk or walk . Aimee, pictured at two years old, which was when she was diagnosed . On April 17, 2010, Jill and Justin were told the reason for their daughter’s slow development was Rett Syndrome, which only affects young girls. She said: 'We had no idea what it meant, we had never heard of it. They said a cure for the disease would not be found during Aimee’s life. 'Of course we were devastated, it was our little girl. Nothing can prepare you to hear that she will never be able to look after herself, talk or walk and that there was no hope of her getting better - it was very very difficult.' Aimee was born a few weeks early so her parents didn't worry about her slow development . Jill and Justin along with family and friends, have been trying to raise as much money to enable this research by Rett Syndrome Trust, to be continued. Jill has trained and completed charity runs, whilst Justin and friends took on a Welsh peak challenge, raising £5,000. More recently, girls and boys gathered in Preston for a fun walk dressed as super heroes and princesses in a bid to raise money. Justin said: 'At times you just feel numb because this condition is like a bereavement. We lost our dream of having a healthy daughter and everything that goes with that - that one day I would walk her down the aisle, have grandchildren. 'The first few months she would cry at least three hours a day, but now she is such a happy little soul. She loves being around her grandma, who is always singing. 'Her favourite song is Rumour Has It by Adele, she loves Rihanna too. We never go anywhere without music. One minute she’ll be screaming and when we put on music, she’ll be beaming. She really is one of the happiest girls you will ever meet.' Sufferers of the illness - including . Coleen Rooney’s adopted sister Rosie McLoughlin - have small hands and . feet and experience a 'deceleration' of the rate of head growth. The . illness was first described by Austrian pediatrician Andreas Rett in . 1966 and affects only girls as boys have different genes and male . sufferers of the condition would rarely survive birth.

"The tangled history of a man who claims he's too fat to work - including his five former wives and bizarre bid to take over a football club - was revealed today. Steve Beer shocked the nation on Monday when he appeared on TV boasting how the £1,700-a-week handouts he and latest wife, Michelle, receive covered the cost of their taxpayer-funded wedding. But it emerged today that the 31-stone benefits claimant has twice appeared on Jeremy Kyle and is hated by two of his ex-wives and children. The family of Stephen Beer - who appeared with latest wife Michelle Coombe on a Channel 5 documentary earlier this week - have revealed the emotional trail of destruction he has left behind him . Mr Beer, pictured with latest wife Michelle, has been slammed by his second wife, Alison Symons, and her children  for his treatment of them . Mr Beer, of Plymouth, Devon, married his second wife, Alison Symons, in 1989, having split from first partner, Eileen Mitchell. But he and Ms Symons separated three years later, leaving her with their two children, Sarah and Matty, who were then both less than two years old. Both of his children, who are now in their twenties, today told The Sun they are 'ashamed' of their biological father's benefits-funded lifestyle and treat Mrs Symons' new partner, Steve Symons, as their real father. In March 2009, Mr Beer, who then ran a contract cleaning firm, was involved in a botched bid to take over non-league Weymouth FC. He had hoped to save the then-financially embattled south coast club, but pulled out of a planned deal at the last minute after getting 'cold feet' and suffering a minor stroke. The club's director Ian Winsor said at the time: 'Mr Beer clearly got cold feet. He did have a bit of money and being a major football fan he thought he could help the club. 'However, he has spent too long in Weymouth and, through speaking to people, heard so much bitterness he got scared.' One of the club's players later commented that a meeting with Mr Beer seemed to be the first time the 'prospective owner' had eaten in a restaurant, as he asked for explanations of dishes on the menu. At one pointed in the doomed deal, Mr Beer reportedly produced a cheque for £300,000 that contained spelling mistakes and had Tipp-Ex marks on it. After marriages to a woman believed to have since died and a common-law wife called Fiona Burt, Mr Beer wedded his fifth wife Lynn Kirby in 2001. Mr Beer, pictured during one of his two appearances on the Jeremy Kyle show in 2011 . He was filmed by the makers of Benefits: Too Fat To Work, a Channel 5 documentary about benefit claimants who claim their weight prevents them from working, which was aired earlier this week . The pair were married for ten years but split after Ms Kirby suspected her husband of cheating on her with his current wife, Michelle. She told The Sun's Mike Ridley today that she worked to support him while he 'sat on his fat behind'. She added: 'I don't think he will ever lose weight - he will keep eating and eating.' It is believed Mr Beer has made two emotionally-charged appearances on the Jeremy Kyle show. The first was in 2011, when he made an appearance in a segment entitled: 'I'm your husband's mistress and I'll prove I'm not cheating on him.' He reportedly admitted he failed a lie detector test regarding his affair and at times shouted at host Jeremy Kyle, repeating that 'we all make mistakes'. Mr Beer's son said he and his biological father appeared on the show last year, when a paternity test proved he was his father. But, his son said, 'he still didn't want anything to do with me'. The revelations came after Mr Beer, 45, caused outrage this week when he appeared on Channel 5 documentary Benefits: Too Fat To Work, in which he told of his £3,000 taxpayer-funded wedding to Michelle, 43. Mr Beer can't stand up for more than a few minutes at a time and relies on a council carer to get washed . The couple's big day – which saw £1,000 spent on catering, including £450 for their favourite kebab takeaway for the evening buffet – was paid for almost entirely from benefits. Mr Beer, who  weighs 31st, had to have a suit specially made for the occasion. By contrast his 23st wife became a bride for the first time and wore a white gown for the register office ceremony and church blessing that followed. Their 50 guests were treated to a three-course meal at the reception, followed later by the buffet. Viewers were shown how paramedics were called to the reception in Plymouth, Devon, before Mr Beer was taken to hospital feeling unwell. Mr Beer, who suffers from type 2 diabetes, hypertension and other problems linked to his weight, had a blood clot on the lung and instead of a honeymoon he spent nine days in hospital. He can only stand for a limited period before becoming breathless and his wife said the wedding day trip to hospital was no surprise. Mrs Beer, who has not had a job during her adult life, said: 'I reckon Stephen will be on benefits for most of his life.' Mr Beer used to run a cleaning business and had to give up work six years ago following a stroke. Producers followed them as they organised the ceremony - including canapes and a buffet provided by their favourite kebab shop . Despite being jobless and on a weight management course, the couple can be seen treating themselves to kebabs after they went to a weigh in and realised they had lost a few pounds. The takeaway cost almost £12 . Interviewed about his benefits on the documentary, he said: 'Is it right? Of course not. But at the end of the day I did work. I have worked, I haven't sat on my a*** all the time. I have done some work and so really, why not?' The couple receive around £1,700 a month in benefits. The rent on their one-bedroom flat is paid for by the taxpayer, and a carer comes twice daily to clean and help Mr Beer dress, but the taxpayer pays the £8,000-a-year cost. Mr Beer also uses a specially strengthened mobility scooter, provided at public expense. He insists he wants a job but says no one will give him work because of his weight. He blamed the Government for being too generous to those on benefits. Speaking on ITV's This Morning programme, Mr Beer said: 'The Government is making it easy for people like us. The Government is making it easy for people on benefits.' He said he didn't think he deserved anything, adding: 'I'm the one who put myself in this situation, no one else.' However, he insisted he was now suffering from 'prejudice'. He said he recently applied for an office job but claims he was turned down because he was too overweight. It is believed the couple are currently at a 'boot camp' to lose weight. He also told host Phillip Schofield that he did not always eat kebabs, and that off camera he and his wife were eating 'healthy food'","Steve Beer was on TV this week telling of his benefits-funded wedding .

"Stephanie Greer with her daughter Daisy who became the youngest child in Scotland to have her heart rewired . A couple who were advised to abort their unborn baby when doctors found she only had half a heart were celebrating yesterday - as she prepares to celebrate her first birthday. Daisy Davidson was given just a 40 per cent chance of survival after she was diagnosed with congenital heart disease Tricuspid Atresia in the womb. However, her mother Stephanie Greer, 19, refused to have a termination. Daisy was born in September 2011 and after a few days in intensive care was growing stronger every week. But she then developed a life-threatening infection when she was just six months old, causing her body to shut down. The youngster underwent a gruelling four-hour operation to ‘rewire’ the remaining side of her heart so it could function on its own, becoming the smallest Scottish child to have the operation. Daisy is now about to celebrate her first birthday - a day her parents thought they would never see. Stephanie, who plans to throw a family party for her brave daughter, said: 'At first doctors thought she had a hole in her heart, but it turns out half of it just wasn’t there. 'When she got the infection and her body began to shut down we didn’t think she would come out of hospital, so for her to celebrate her first birthday is amazing. 'It’s a day we never thought we would see. It will be a very emotional day for our family.' Stephanie’s pregnancy went well until doctors at Crosshouse Hospital, East Ayrshire, spotted what was thought to be a hole in Daisy’s heart at her 20-week scan. The worried mother was asked to attend a consultation at Glasgow’s Southern General Hospital where an expert from the Royal Hospital for Sick Children at Yorkhill gave them the devastating news that half of Daisy’s heart was missing. Stephanie said she was then given the agonising option of aborting her unborn baby but decided to carry on with the pregnancy. She carried her daughter almost to term and when was induced five days early Daisy weighed a healthy seven pounds three ounces. Daisy was kept in hospital for five days before being allowed home where she was fed on high calorie milk and given daily aspirin to thin her blood. But just before Christmas last year the young girl’s health began to decline when she developed a viral infection. Daisy Davidson underwent the first major operation on her heart weeks after she was born . Stephanie and Alec with their brave daughter who is celebrating her first birthday next month . Daisy was rushed into surgery where she was given an operation to rewire her struggling heart to allow it to function on its own. Stephanie, who lives in Irvine, with partner Alex Davidson, 21, said: 'Just before Christmas she stopped feeding and going to the toilet because of an infection. 'She had been booked into surgery in January or February but doctors said because of her condition we needed to do it sooner. Daisy is starting to take her first steps . 'The doctors said she was too small for it because she only weighed nine pounds at that point but they did it anyway. The doctor said she was the smaller baby he had ever performed that operation on. 'We really thought that was it. We really thought she was going to die. I never want to go through anything like that again.' Since the operation Daisy has gone from strength to strength and, though still on high calorie milk, is now learning to walk. She will celebrate her birthday, on September 27, surrounded by family and friends. Throughout Daisy’s ordeal the family have been supported by the Little Hearts Matter charity, which supports families of children with heart conditions. Stephanie said: 'A lot of people are unaware of how serious heart conditions can be in children and we really want to make people aware of what we go through as a family. 'When Daisy was diagnosed I felt so alone. I didn’t know what to do. 'But I want people to know that a diagnosis like that isn’t a death sentence. There is hope and a lot of support out there.' Tricuspid atresia is a condition that caused the heart to develop abnormalities. The defect blocks blood flow from the right atrium to the right ventricle and as a result blood cannot flow into the lungs properly.","Daisy underwent a gruelling four-hour operation to ‘rewire’ her heart so it could function properly .

"A leading public health expert's proposal to lower the age of consent to 15 has been swiftly rejected by the Prime Minister. Professor John Ashton, president of the Faculty of Public Health, said society had to accept 'the facts' that around a third of boys and girls have sex at 14 or 15. He argued that lowering the current legal age of 16 would make it easier for 15-year-olds to get sexual health advice from teachers and health workers. Prime Minister David Cameron swiftly rejected a leading public health expert's proposal to lower the age of consent to 15 . Professor John Ashton says the Government should consider lowering the age of sexual consent to 15 . Countries in Europe that have lower . ages of consent tend to see teenagers starting sexual relationships . later and have lower rates of teenage pregnancy, he claimed. But Downing Street shot down the . idea, saying the age at 16 was in place to protect children and there . were 'no plans to change it'. Prof Ashton said lowering it by a year could actually prevent teenagers having sex at 14 or younger. He said: 'I would not personally . argue for 14 but I think we should seriously be looking at 15 so that we . can draw a line in the sand, and really, as a society, actively . discourage sexual involvement under 15. 'By doing that you would be able legitimately to organise services to meet the need.' He added: 'I suspect we might be . better off with it at 15 because the teachers and people who are in . contact with young people would feel on a firmer footing pointing them . in the right direction where they can get advice and contraception to . protect their physical health from disease and other problems.' The president of the Faculty of Public Health says society sends 'confused' signals about when sex is permitted . The Faculty of Public Health, which . represents doctors working in this field, is independent of government . but advises ministers and civil servants. The age of consent is 14 in Germany, . Austria, Hungary, Italy and Portugal. It is 15 in Denmark, France, . Greece, Sweden and Poland, and 16 in Belgium, the Netherlands, Norway, . Luxembourg and Finland. In Spain it is 13 but is being raised to 16. Nick Clegg said he was worried about . 'high levels of teenage pregnancy' but thought 'modernising' sex . education in schools rather than lowering the age of consent was the . answer. Labour spokesman Luciana Berger agreed that changing the age of consent was not the way to tackle teenage pregnancy. 'I'm . worried, like everybody's worried, about the sexualisation of the . culture and the information that so many young people are bombarded with . at the moment. That's why I do want see action,' he told BBC1's The . Andrew Marr Show. 'I'm . constantly urging (Education Secretary) Michael Gove and the Department . for Education to update and modernise sex education in schools which . hasn't kept up with the internet age. 'But do I think simply a blanket reduction in the age of consent is the answer to this difficult dilemma? No.' Nick Clegg said he does not think lowering the age of consent was the solution to the problem . Shadow public health minister Luciana Berger said Labour opposed lowering the age of consent and called for mandatory sex and relationship education. Ms Berger said the opposition had tried to get such changes enshrined in law but Tory MPs blocked the moves in Parliament. She said: 'Lowering the age of consent is not the way to tackle teenage pregnancy and we are against such a move. Shadow public health minister Luciana Berger called for mandatory sex and relationship education . 'The teenage pregnancy rate fell substantially under the last Labour government. But sexual health clinics are now closing their doors and young people are struggling to get appointments. 'Labour has called for improved sex and relationship education, and tabled amendments to recent legislation for it to be made mandatory, not voluntary, in all schools. 'Regrettably, the change was voted down by Tory MPs.' In 1875 the Offences Against the Persons Act raised the age of sexual consent from 12 to 13 in Great Britain and Ireland. Ten years later, the Criminal Law Amendment Act raised it again, to 16. According to organisations such as the International Child and Youth Care Network, an age of consent of 16 criminalises more than half the teenage population and makes it hard to give them proper advice and support to prevent diseases, unwanted pregnancies and abuse. The Faculty of Public Health, part of the . Royal Colleges of Physicians, gives advice to ministers and civil . servants although it is independent of government.","Prof John Ashton is the president of the Faculty of Public Health .

In particular, we thank everyone at Alder Hey Hospital and . Claire House Children's Hospice. 'There will be no further statements from the family at this time.' Coleen, 26, was said to idolise her . adopted sister and chose Rosie as chief bridesmaid when she married . Manchester United and England footballer Wayne Rooney in 2008. Last night she took to Twitter to express her sorrow, writing: ‘We are absolutely heartbroken to have lost our angel Rosie. ‘So glad we ended our holiday short, . due to her deteriorating & we was able to spend the last few days . together with her and our family! Sleep tight Rosie Mc x. We love you . more than words can say x.’ Rosie was originally taken in as a . foster child by Coleen’s parents, bricklayer Tony and Colette, a former . nursery nurse, when she was two. Although they were aware she was . disabled they did not know the full extent of her condition, which has . no cure. In an exclusive article for The Mail . on Sunday in 2006, Coleen wrote: ‘When Rosie arrived she could crawl, . and even though she couldn’t use her hands that much she would handle . toys on her play mat and she could eat. ‘But over a period of time she . stopped crawling and lost what use of her hands she had. Then she . started having problems swallowing her food. ‘It took pretty much a year for Rosie . to be diagnosed and, looking back, I can see how much Mum pushed to . find out what was wrong with her and to try to do what was best for . her.’ It was a heartfelt and moving tribute . to her sister who, she said, ‘can’t talk to us but you can tell when . she’s happy – she laughs and giggles and her eyes sparkle’. The Rooneys now have a three-year-old . son, Kai, and their second son is due in May. Because Rosie was . adopted, there is no chance of Coleen passing Rosie’s genetic condition . on to her unborn child. Her mother Colette has said: ‘Coleen . idolises Rosie and Rosie idolises Coleen  . . .  when Coleen walks into . the room Rosie’s  eyes light up.’ Coleen made a TV  documentary about . the funding of  children’s hospices to raise awareness of places such as . Claire House in Liverpool, where Rosie stayed two nights a week. In last night’s statement the family thanked staff at Claire House, and also Alder Hey Children’s Hospital.

Children's Hospice and Alder Hey Children's Hospital . Close: The family pictured at the Manchester United Vs Sunderland Match at Old Trafford. Coleen is accompanied by her parents Tony and Colette, Rosie and her son Kai . Rett syndrome is a rare and incurable genetic disorder that causes severe physical and  mental disability. Affecting about 1 in every 12,000 girls – and only much more rarely seen in boys – it is usually diagnosed in early childhood when infants fail to develop normally or begin losing basic skills they have already learned. Sufferers can live to the age of 40 but about 95 per cent survive only until they are 25. The condition involves a mutation in a specific gene which affects  the way the brain develops and prevents other genes from working in the correct way. Initially symptoms can be vague, but include speech problems and losing the use of the hands. Some children stop using eye contact and lose interest in toys. A period of rapid degeneration follows which can last several months. Children will usually need round-the-clock care and will be unable to do even the simplest tasks on their own. Many will be unable to walk, talk or focus and some will develop symptoms not unlike autism. A third stage, where symptoms plateau, can then last for many years. Some will remain in this state for the rest of their lives. Many will suffer regular seizures and severe motor problems but their condition will not deteriorate. There is no cure, and treatment involves managing the symptoms. Medication may be needed for breathing problems and motor difficulties, and anti-epileptic drugs may be used to control seizures. Those at risk of dying from the syndrome will usually have experienced severe seizures, swallowing difficulties and greatly reduced mobility. Other sufferers can die from pneumonia. Because the condition is so  rare – and because the majority  of sufferers do not go on to have children – it is not known if it is hereditary. However, it is thought the chances of parents having a second child with the condition are about one per cent.","Coleen cut her Barbados holiday short to be with Rosie as her health deteriorated this week .

"A retired Army officer has pleaded guilty to the manslaughter of his wife of more than 40 years who he stabbed to death at their home. Leonard Webb, 68, entered his plea on the grounds of diminished responsibility at Winchester Crown Court but denied the murder of his 64-year-old wife Doreen. Police were called to the couple's home in Durrington, Wiltshire, in April last year where they found Mrs Webb who had been stabbed in the chest. Paramedics were unable to save her. Leonard Webb admitted the manslaughter of his wide, Doreen, on the grounds of diminished responsibility . Judge Keith Cutler told Webb that his plea had been accepted by the Crown Prosecution Service and a sentencing hearing would be held at which psychiatric evidence would be presented. A statement released by Mrs Webb's family after her death said: 'There are few words to describe her. Our mother and nanny was simply the best. 'They were happily married for over 44 years and shared so many precious moments together, travelling the world and being around for their family. 'We are all still trying to deal with, and understand, this situation. We would also like to give thanks to the medical team that attended the incident.' Webb was a major on his retirement from the Army in 1993, the Ministry of Defence confirmed, and had run a military memorabilia business before his arrest.

"Virat Kohli became the first man ever to make three Test centuries in his first three innings as captain and Lokesh Rahul made the first of his career as India fought back on day three of the fourth Test against Australia at Sydney. The hosts had declared on 572 on day two but India produced a brilliant response to reach 342 for five, a deficit of 230, with Kohli hitting his fourth ton of the series as the pair put on 141 for the third wicket. Rahul had reached 110 when he was dismissed in just his second match while Kohli, in his first match as full-time skipper following the shock resignation of Mahendra Singh Dhoni, was undefeated on 140. VIDEO Confusion in the sky as Steven Smith spills catch and blames spidercam . Virat Kohli celebrates and acknowledges the crowd after scoring a century for India against Australia . Kohli raises his bat in the air as he reaches his century on day three of the fourth Test in Sydney . India's Lokesh Rahul looks towards the sky as he celebrates his century against Australia . India began the day on 71 for one and made slow progress in the early stages, adding just 12 runs in the first 10 overs. Despite the slow going, Rohit Sharma brought up his half-century off 132 balls but was gone to the next one he faced as he edged a Nathan Lyon delivery onto the stumps to depart for 53. A major talking point then came three overs before lunch when Rahul did not get hold of a pull off Shane Watson and the ball went flying into the air with Steve Smith looking certain to make the catch. The stand-in captain, though, spilled the opportunity and instantly pointed to the sky, suggesting the ball may have hit the 'spider-cam' system of camera wires above the pitch. Both Cricket Australia and the Australian broadcasters later confirmed that was not the case but admitted Smith had been 'distracted by one of the wires in his eye line' and the fielder looked furious to have spilled the opener on 46.

Smith looks skywards and points towards the spider-cam after dropping a catch . A general view of the Sydney Cricket Ground on Thursday shows the spider-cam above the field of play . The rate did not pick up a great deal after the interval but the batsmen were clearly comfortable in the middle, finding the boundary with anything loose, and Rahul moved into the 90s with a six off Lyon. Kohli then reached his half-century before the new ball was taken and Mitchell Starc almost had the skipper through the gate first ball but it took a slight inside edge and went to the rope. Smith then put down another chance but this time he had nobody to blame but himself as Kohli got on an edge to a Starc ball and it flew high to second slip where Smith spilled the opportunity above his head. More drama was to come before tea as Rahul, who had recorded scores of three and one on debut in Melbourne, brought up his maiden Test ton off 253 balls as he guided the ball to the rope past gully.

The crowd, many of whom are wearing pink, cheer during day three of the fourth Test . His joy was short lived, however, as in just the second over after tea he was gone, pulling a Starc delivery high into the air and the bowler claimed the catch himself at the batsman's end. That seemed to prompt Kohli to want to race to his century and the right-hander joined counterpart Smith in making it four for the series off 162 balls. It had very much been the tourists' day so far but Watson changed the complexion slightly with two wickets in as many balls in the 100th over. First Ajinkya Rahane was trapped in front for 13 and then Suresh Raina edged to Brad Haddin, who made an impressive catch diving to his left. That could have had India wobbling but Kohli and Wriddhiman Saha (14 not out) made it through to the close with the former becoming the top Indian run-scorer in a series in Australia.","Virat Kohli is the first man to score three Test centuries in his first three innings as captain .

"Drug possession is being decriminalised ‘by the back door’, it has been claimed – with fewer than 1 per cent of those caught with narcotics going to prison. Of the 148,000 people found with drugs last year, including heroin and cocaine, only 1,141 were sent to jail. The figures were even lower for those caught with Class B drugs - with only 541 in England and Wales imprisoned. Some 64,000 cannabis users received nothing more than a ticking off. Drug possession is being decriminalised ‘by the back door’, it has been claimed – with fewer than 1 per cent of those caught with narcotics going to prison (file picture) Critics said the figures showed drug possession was being decriminalised by stealth – despite the Prime Minister’s insistence that drug use was ‘never acceptable’. The revelations come in the wake of a Home Office report which demanded a radical shake-up of the UK’s drug laws. The Lib Dems claimed the study, which compared drugs policies in different countries around the world, showed that relaxing the rules on banned narcotics did not increase the number of addicts. Hailing the report as a ‘dramatic blow’ to hardliners, Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg strengthened his support for decriminalisation of drugs for personal use – including deadly Class A substances. Lib Dem Home Office minister Norman Baker blasted strict punishments for possession in the UK and criticised the authorities for ‘banging up’ those caught with small amounts of drugs. But an analysis of police arrests for possessing drugs revealed only a tiny proportion – just 0.8 per cent – received a custodial sentence, even though there is the threat of a maximum sentence of life imprisonment for possessing Class A substances. Of the 148,000 people found with drugs last year, including heroin and cocaine, only 1,141 were sent to jail. The figures were even lower for those caught with Class B drugs - with only 541 in England and Wales imprisoned. Some 64,000 cannabis users received nothing more than a ticking off . In 2013-14, police issued penalties for drug possession to around 148,189 people, according to Home Office and Ministry of Justice figures. Some 63,967 were let off with a cannabis warning – where a culprit is given a stern talking to by a police officer in the street. A further 14,768 received penalty notices – on-the-spot fines – ordering them to pay a minimum £60. And another 31,368 were given a caution – effectively a slap on the wrist. Of those hauled before a court 38,120 were sentenced, of which 1,141 were sent to prison. David Green, chief executive of think-tank Civitas, said: ‘When people like the Liberal Democrats say that our regime is too severe and needs relaxing, they are wrong. 'We have been trying a drugs policy of ultra-relaxation. I find it very puzzling. We have already got as close to decriminalising possession of drugs as is possible without actually taking the final step. ‘I don’t want to see people in prison for possessing a small bit of cannabis. They need educating and treating. But the Liberal Democrats are going even further with their calls for decriminalisation. ‘The point of the law is to protect the weak, the vulnerable and the easily addicted and decriminalisation would see them exploited by drug dealers.’ Peter Cuthbertson, director of the Centre for Crime Prevention think-tank, said: ‘It is completely false to pretend that we have so far been fighting a tough war on drugs. ‘This decriminalisation by the back door means people see very little risk associated with trying drugs – and then potentially becoming hooked.’ Shadow crime minister Diana Johnson said: ‘Nick Clegg’s proposal is nonsense.’ A Home Office source said: ‘Banning prison sentences for these individuals will make it harder to get them into treatment programmes and lead to higher crime rates.'","Figures include those found with heroin and cocaine .

"St Mirren are close to being sold to a consortium of Argentinian investors spearheaded by lawyer Ricardo Pini in a deal worth £1.5million. Sportsmail understands that an agreement has been been reached in principle - and funds for the sale of shares are expected to change hands this week. Chairman Stewart Gilmour, vice-chairman George Campbell, director Bryan McAusland, former secretary Allan Marshall and Evelyn Purves, widow of former director Jim, put their 52 per cent stake in the club up for sale in 2009. St Mirren are close to being sold to a consortium of Argentinian investors in a deal worth £1.5million . Former directors Ken McGeouch and Gordon Scott are also expected to sell their shares – giving the new owners a 75 per cent majority stake in the club. Pini and his brother Sebastien were given a tour of St Mirren Park and the club’s Ralston training ground with Scottish agent Neil Murray last month. The two were previously involved with Chilean club Rangers de Talca, before selling their shares last year following the club’s relegation to the country’s second flight. After failing to buy Motherwell, their deal to buy Premiership St Mirren will be completed following the collapse of ‘advanced talks’ between the Paisley club and an English consortium last week. iChairman Stewart Gilmour is one of a number of people selling their shares in the Scottish club . Those negotiations floundered when one of the group, 52-year-old Thavar Mohammed, was found to have a conviction for fraud. It’s understood, however, that the offer from the Argentine group is higher than that of the English group. The deal will place the future of caretaker manager Gary Teale under scrutiny – with the South Americans likely to install their own manager.

"Jo-Wilfried Tsonga has pulled out of the Australian Open with a persistent arm injury. The 29-year-old Frenchman, who also withdrew from this week's Hopman Cup with the same complaint, confirmed on Twitter that the start of his season will be delayed. He described the latest blow as a 'big disappointment' and posted a picture of his right arm, complete with a brace stretching from the base of his hand to the middle of his forearm. Jo-Wilfried Tsonga sits by the side of the court during the Davis Cup final in Lille in November . The two-time Wimbledon semi-finalist struggled with the injury during France's Davis Cup final defeat to Switzerland in November and is hoping the extra rest will help him make a complete recovery. 'I'm still suffering from a forearm inflammation (intersection syndrome) and that prevents me being at 100 per cent of my capacities in a competition,' Tsonga said on his official website.

"Joe Launchbury has handed England a World Cup boost by declaring the spinal surgery he recently had a success — while targeting a return before the end of the season. The 23-year-old lock, one of the first names on Stuart Lancaster’s team-sheet when fit, was operated on last month to correct a long-standing problem which had failed to improve despite missing November’s QBE series. Following initial concerns Launchbury would not play again this season, leaving him just three summer warm-up games to prove his fitness for the World Cup in September, the Wasps star said he expects to play again by April. Joe Launchbury has targeted a return to action before the end of the season following spinal surgery . The lock signed a new contract with Wasps on Thursday and is hoping to boost their options in April . ‘The surgeon was really happy with how the operation went,’ he said on Thursday. ‘It wasn’t as bad as it was feared at one stage, so we’re looking at a gradual return to training in around 12 weeks. ‘For now I’m in the gym and it’s great to be able to concentrate on getting my arm and neck stronger rather than playing through pain. ‘I can feel a massive difference already. I’m targeting being back for April and am really looking forward to trying to play my part in Wasps’ campaign.’ Launchbury signed a new contract with Wasps last November and his decision to remain loyal to Dai Young’s men has played a central role in the club’s ability to retain players and attract stars.

"A Kiev millionaire has announced that he is selling his luxury possessions and donating his wealth to the army as he joins the fight against pro-Russian rebels in east Ukraine. Vyacheslav Konstantinovsky, 53, has joined the army in Donbas, and has put his assets, including a Rolls Royce Phantom, on the market to benefit the military. The news of Konstantinovsky's dedication comes after as many as 14 Ukrainian soldiers died in clashes with rebels near the crash site of flight MH17 on Friday. Joining the fight: Millionaire Vyacheslav Konstantinovsky, famous in Ukraine for model girlfriends, fast cars, and mansion homes, has given up his luxury life to join the army . Duty: Konstantinovsky, right, is Ukraine's 44th richest man - alongside his brother - but is now fighting in Donbas . Clashes: Government soldiers fire on pro-Russian separatists near Pervomaysk in east Ukraine on Thursday, as at least ten soldiers were killed in an alleged ambush today . Army sources confirmed 14 people have . been killed today, ten of them Ukrainian Airborne Troops soldiers, in . what Kiev says was an ambush set up by militants near the town of . Shakhtarsk, eastern Ukraine. The . bloody confrontation took place 15miles from the MH17 crash site, where . an international team of experts is due to carry out inspections today. Vyacheslav is worth over £2million and, along with his identical twin brother Aleksander, he is Ukraine's 44th richest person. Vyacheslav has taken to social media to confirm that he has joined the fight in east Ukraine. ‘Friends, . thank you again for your kind words. It's true that I am on my way . there, although those who are still fighting are the real heroes,’ he . wrote on his Facebook page.

Development Group (KDD), which has investments in several areas, . including a restaurant group, a fast-food chain and construction work. They . are known anti-Russians, and were the targets in a 2006 murder plot by . the Russian mafia which was foiled by the FBI in New York. At the time, the U.S. Department of Justice referred to the arrested suspects as ‘Russian organised crime figures’. The clashes in east Ukraine on Friday morning is said to have been an ambush by pro-Russian separatists, and although the initial death toll was reported as 20, this was later reduced to 14.

Military efforts: A government soldier drives a car near Pervomaysk as a group of international experts have set out to make a second visit to the MH17 crash site on Friday . Clashes continue in the area surrounding the MH17 crash site, making it difficult for international experts to reach the area to recover an estimated 80 bodies still at the site . ‘In total it is known that 14 people . died but the bodies of four of them have not been identified and could . be Ukrainian soldiers or terrorists,’ said military spokesman Oleksiy . Dmytrashkivsky. ‘So far we are talking about 10 Ukrainian servicemen dead.’ The death toll of 14 had been reduced from 20, which had been reported earlier in the day. Meanwhile, . a convoy of international investigators set out for a second visit to . the crash site but on a road that did not go through Shakhtarsk. A small team managed to perform an initial survey of the area for the first time yesterday. For days, clashes along routes to the wreckage site had kept investigators from reaching the area to find and retrieve bodies that have been decaying in the 32C heat. Independent observers warned that there has been tampering with evidence. Today, the team were travelling in 15 cars and one bus from their base in the rebel stronghold of Donetsk. Their convoy was joined by three vehicles from the International Committee of the Red Cross when it reached the government-controlled town of Debaltseve.

It is believed up . to 80 bodies may still remain uncollected at the crash site, which is . spread in a broad area across fields between two villages. Investigators working on the site say their first priority will be to recover human remains and retrieve victims' belongings, so that they can be returned home. New violence could jeopardise hopes of the investigation into the cause of the crash in which 298 perished and could also prevent the collection of an estimated 80 bodies still at the site. Dutch police leading the international probe say the crash site remains perilous. ‘The security situation is still very unstable,’ said Pieter-Jaap Aalbersberg, head of the mission to repatriate the remains of the victims. ‘We are not absolutely sure if we can reach the crash site with the whole team of experts in the near future, but we are more hopeful than we were yesterday.’ The Ukrainian military said it was re-launching a broader offensive against separatist fighters following a day-long ceasefire but insisted troops would not carry out operations in the immediate vicinity of the crash site.","Government troops 'ambushed' by pro-Russian militants in Ukraine .

"In a year littered with trophies, baubles, mementos and achievements, a simple letter perhaps means as much as anything to Stephen Gallacher. That European team captain Paul McGinley should take time to write to one of his Ryder Cup rookies, the local lad who left Gleneagles without a point but with a headful of memories, said something about more than just the Irishman’s inspired leadership. If some might feel that Gallacher may have regrets over his contribution to the home win, a foursomes defeat alongside Ian Poulter on the opening morning and then a singles loss to a turbocharged Phil Mickelson on the Sunday, the 40-year-old is at pains to dispel the myth. Stephen Gallacher poses with the Dubai Classic Trophy after his triumph earlier this year . The Scot, whose best year as a pro was rewarded with honorary membership of the PGA yesterday, says even that dysfunctional pairing with Poulter — something McGinley concedes was never given the pre-event time to develop — remains a fond recollection of his week in the Perthshire hills. ‘I wouldn’t take it back,’ said Gallacher. ‘It was absolutely brilliant, playing with Ian. Paul’s reasoning was that he told me I was playing the first morning. ‘And he said: “You’re standing there with the Saltire on and Poulter hasn’t been on form as normal — and the big crowd is what he loves to get him up to play his best. He’s out with you and you’ll have a massive following”. Gallacher savoured the home support at Gleneagles despite his disappointing display . ‘He just thought that would be the spur and it obviously didn’t work. But neither of us played well. We only had one birdie. But I have no negativity about the Ryder Cup — only positives. I wouldn’t change it for anything. ‘Paul sent me a text first and then a letter at the Race to Dubai. He wrote everybody a letter. I’ll probably not show it to many people because it’s personal and it’s a mark of the man. ‘He talked to me about how I handled being left out on the Saturday, as did a few of my peers. There are 12 guys and you leave your egos at the door. It’s purely the result that you want and it doesn’t matter how it happens. ‘Yes, I would have liked to have played a bit more. But would I swap that and get beat? No, I wouldn’t. Gallacher (left) jokes with Phil Mickelson during the pair's foursomes match at the Ryder Cup . ‘Against Mickelson, that was probably as good as I’ve played all year. But you are playing one of the top guys outwith Tiger — what is it he’s got, five or six majors? Also, if he doesn’t go out and beat me, he can’t have a go at Tom Watson, who would have just turned around and said: “Well, you got beat...” ‘I held my head up high and I enjoyed it. I desperately want to play in the Ryder Cup again. ‘Paul’s given me a lot of confidence, not just with the letter and text. We’ve been in contact a lot. The stuff he said has been brilliant.’ Rory McIlroy took to Twitter to show off his Scottish-themed outfit with Scotland's Gallagher after the win . Gallacher ends 2014 as world No 35, up 31 places in 12 months, while his European Tour earnings of £1.35million have been bolstered by eight top-10 finishes — including becoming the first player to defend the Dubai Desert Classic. More impressive than anything, though, was his ferocious — and exhausting — charge to the brink of automatic Ryder Cup qualification. Missing out by the narrowest of margins, he was, the captain has since admitted, McGinley’s first pick as a wild card. ‘I’m definitely ready for a break,’ said the third member of Bathgate Golf Club’ s great Ryder Cup trio, following Eric Brown and his own uncle, Bernard Gallacher, into the famous team event. ‘This year, it’s one that’s going to be hard to top, you know. I’m going to have to work even harder and really be on the ball. Europe quartet (from left) Rory McIlroy, Stephen Gallacher, Jamie Donaldson and Henrik Stenson celebrate as Europe win the Ryder Cup at Gleneagles . ‘But the key is not to panic and try to do too much. I’ve done a lot this year. I think I had a first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, seventh and eighth. ‘I’m very close. I just need to keep doing what I’m doing. ‘You never look back. You know you’ve had a good year — but all you’re trying to do is bottle that formula. ‘You don’t end up 34th or 35th in the world by having one good year. You’ve got to have two or three good years, or it cascades away. Team Europe take time out amid wild celebrations to pose for group photo at Gleneagles . ‘I’m getting more consistent. I just want to improve slightly in places — that wee bit here and there — and who knows, you could be in the top 10 as quick as that. It’s such a fine margin. ‘Last year I had to chase the world points, so I was a wee bit out of my comfort zone playing in America when I didn’t really want to then, at the end, I played eight out of nine weeks. ‘But it’s testament to the physical work I’ve done that I could do that. One of the keys at the start of the year was having no injuries so I could dictate my schedule, play more if I need to. I’ve not had a twinge for a year. That’s a massive breakthrough. McGinley and his players pose for disheveled group photo after living up to their bill as favourites against the USA . ‘You look at a football player who spends three weeks out. It can sometimes take them four or five weeks to get back. So, if I had to miss three of the biggest weeks, then there’s more pressure on me when I come back. And, if I don’ t settle right away, that’s two months lost, isn’t it? ‘I didn’t want any distractions. I wanted to play when I wanted, not when I felt like I needed time off. I feel as fresh at the end of the year as I did at the start of the year. That’s a massive change. ‘Generally, I get to the end of the year and feel a wreck. I cannae hit a shot. Now, I’ve had a week and a bit off just to give the golfing muscles a break. It didn't take long for the champagne to start flowing after the trophy had been raised . ‘The one thing I’ve learned this year is that my bad shots are better. I’m swinging better and hitting the ball better, so I’m pin high more. All the good putters give themselves chances. It’s hard if you’re hitting it to 40 feet. ‘My game is improving, and it comes down to putting. ‘I went to see (short game guru) Dave Stockton and he made a difference, so I’ ll try to see him again in January for a refresher.’","Stephen Gallacher failed to register a point during Europe's Ryder Cup triumph at Gleneagles .

"Stoke boss Mark Hughes has accused people of being 'lazy' for labelling his side as bullies every time they claim a stunning result. It was the case almost five weeks ago when Stoke conjured a superb 3-2 Barclays Premier League win over Arsenal, leading 3-0 at the break before the Gunners finally fought back late in the second period. That result and performance has fired up Stoke as they have lost just one of their last seven matches from early December going into the return league clash with Arsenal at the Emirates on Sunday. Stoke manager Mark Hughes denies claims his side are bullies and feels the claims overshadows their ability . Stoke defender Phil Bardsley (left) brings down Chelsea attacker Eden Hazard (right) Peter Crouch puts Stoke ahead in the 3-2 victory over Arsenal in the Premier League in December . 'The last time we played them we played exceptionally well,' said Hughes. 'After the game some people used certain terms to explain why we beat Arsenal, such as intimidation and we bullied them out of the result, which wasn't the case at all. 'I would argue for the first 60 to 70 minutes of the game we were by far the best team on the pitch. We played them off the park. 'We were the team that played the best football by getting the ball down, passing and moving and creating chances. 'To describe us as bullies was the wrong word, a lazy term and an easy one to label us with. 'It's a term that goes back to bygone days when people had a different impression of us. 'There are other terms that could have illustrated how well we played on the day, such as competitive, and there is a difference. Charlie Adam (right) was criticised for this foul on Alexis Sanchez (left) in the last game between the two sides . Stoke went 3-0 up over Arsenal before Arsene Wenger's side fought back with two goals . Hostilities exist between the two teams since Ryan Shawcross (right) broke Aaron Ramsey's (centre) leg . 'We are competitive as we look to get the ball down and play, and we have a plan A and plan B depending on the circumstances of the game. 'We can go more direct if we feel it's the right thing to do, but if we see weaknesses in teams then we will try and exploit them. 'We are a different side now with different qualities, and weapons I would suggest, and we can use them to good effect. 'If we get it right then on our day we are difficult to play against, which we have proven this year home and away.' The reasoning behind the 'bully' remarks stems from the animosity that has often existed between the two teams, going back five years when Ryan Shawcross broke the leg of Aaron Ramsey in a league game in February 2010. Bad blood has often flowed in matches between the two sides since, yet a dismissive Hughes added: 'It just raises its head every time we play Arsenal. 'How long has it been? Five or six years? Goodness me, a lot of water has passed under the bridge. Philipp Wollscheid (right) could make his Stoke debut after signing for the club on loan from Bayer Leverkusen . Bojan Krkic scored in Stoke's win over Arsenal and could return to the side for the clash at The Emirates . 'We seem to have to answer the same questions every time we come up against each other. There are other angles to pursue other than an incident five or six years ago. 'We're certainly sick of it, Arsenal undoubtedly are, so everybody should move on.' Germany defender Philipp Wollscheid, signed on loan for the rest of the season from Bayer Leverkusen earlier this week, goes straight into the squad. Hughes has four players - defenders Marc Muniesa and Marc Wilson, midfielder Victor Moses and striker Bojan Krkic - who are also in the frame, although may not figure as they are returning from injury.","Mark Hughes says claims that Stoke are bullies are lazy accusations .

Midfielder Huddlestone said: 'I was speaking to a couple of the lads yesterday when we heard the rumour and they were saying he's a handful. Arsenal striker Yaya Sanogo (right) celebrates after scoring against Dortmund in the Champions League . Hull City midfielder Tom Huddlestone has praised Sanogo, calling him an 'intelligent footballer' 'He's an intelligent footballer for one so young. The times I've seen him at Arsenal, I think he's done very well. 'He's been a bit unlucky at Arsenal in front of goal and at the highest level, which Arsenal is, you probably need to be a bit more clinical but football-wise he's done well. He's impressed me.' Sanogo grabbed his first competitive goal in the Champions League against Borussia Dortmund but he has yet to score in the league in 11 appearances for Arsenal. That lack of goals has not put off Bruce, who is also aware of his two goals as France Under-21s came back to beat England 3-2 in November. Bruce said: 'To be fair to him, how many times has he played? It's always very difficult coming on as sub. Tigers boss Steve Bruce has also admitted that he has been impressed by the Frenchman . Sanogo battles for the ball with Bayern Munich captain Philipp Lahm last season at the Emirates Stadium . 'I don't know how many starts he's had but he played against us in the cup final and I was very impressed with him. I saw him play for Arsenal against Dortmund in the Champions League as well. 'For the French under-21s he's been nothing short of fantastic. I saw a game when they beat England and I thought he was terrific. 'When you take a young boy, especially a striker, it's a question of whether they can come and do it. I took Nicklas Bendtner (on loan from Arsenal for Birmingham) when he was 18 and he won me (promotion from) the Championship. 'Sanogo is a very good player. I like him a lot and it may be an option for us - but I don't think we're alone in that one.'","Arsene Wenger revealed he was keen for Yaya Sanogo to go out on loan .

"Manchester City were given a huge boost on Thursday as star striker Sergio Aguero returned to training following a knee ligament injury. The Argentine hitman has been sidelined since December 6 when a challenge from Everton's Muhamed Besic left him in tears on the touchline. But he was pictured back in action at City's training ground as Manuel Pellegrini's men prepare to face the Toffees in the return fixture at Goodison Park. Manchester City striker Sergio Aguero plays a pass during a training session on Thursday afternoon . Aguero, with his knee heavily strapped, gets involved in his first full session since being injured in December . Aguero was left in tears after damaging his knee ligaments against Everton in early December . Aguero's left knee was still heavily strapped as he took part in Thursday's session, while his fellow striker Edin Dzeko also took part after recovering from a calf problem. It appears likely that Saturday's clash against Roberto Martinez's side will come too soon for the pair, with Stevan Jovetic likely to keep his place up-front. Aguero scored 14 goals in 15 Premier League appearances before being injured and a return against Arsenal on January 18 looks like most likely for the former Atletico Madrid man. Skipper Vincent Kompany, who has not played since the 1-0 win against Leicester on December 13, is also in contention again after overcoming a troublesome hamstring injury. Frank Lampard enjoys a laugh with Aguero (right) as he trains ahead of Saturday's clash with Everton . Edin Dzeko (second from left) also returned to training on Thursday after recovering from a calf injury . Midfielder Frank Lampard also looked to be in good spirits as he trained alongside Aguero on Thursday. The ex-Chelsea man has had his short-term deal at the Etihad extended until the end of the season and he could start against Everton as Pellegrini looks to keep his squad fresh following the busy festive period. Meanwhile, City are continuing negotiations with Swansea over striker Wilfried Bony with a £30million deal expected to be completed within the next few days. Pellegrini is keen to strengthen his attacking options after being forced to play James Milner as an emergency forward while Aguero, Dzeko and Jovetic were all out injured. Swansea striker Wilfried Bony is on the verge of a £30million move to champions Manchester City .","Sergio Aguero damaged knee ligaments against Everton on December 6 .

"Tony Pulis will spend Sunday considering a fascinating dilemma: how does a new manager convincingly rant and rave at a team which has just won a cup tie by scoring seven unanswered goals? As one of the game’s renowned ranters, Pulis will presumably find a way and he will do so in the knowledge that his criticism will be amply deserved. For more than 40 minutes of this extraordinary match, Albion were frequently outclassed by Gateshead’s neat, thoughtful passing game. Pulis, untypically clad in executive suit, spent a frustrating opening quarter of an hour in the stands and had then taken to the touchline to bawl at his new troops. Saido Berahino’s performance had matched that of his team in its listless lack of energy and concern. West Brom striker Saido Berahino slots home his side's first goal of the game against Gateshead on Saturday afternoon . Berahino gets a hug from Craig Dawson (left) as West Brom's players celebrate taking the lead against their non-league opponents . Berahino (right) is congratulated by his strike partner Victor Anichebe after opening the scoring in Tony Pulis' first game in charge . West Brom: Myhill 6, Baird 6, McAuley 7, Dawson 6, Pocognoli 6; Dorrans (Samaras, 54, 5.5) 7, Morrison 7, Brunt 7.5, Sessegnon 6.5 (Varela 65, 5.5); Berahino 9, Anichebe 6 (Yacob, 54, 6) Subs not used: Foster, Wisdom, Ideye, Mulumbu, Varela . Goals: Berahino (42, 46, 53, 90), Anichebe 45, Brunt 55, Morrison 78 . Gateshead: Bartlett 7; Baxter 5, Curtis 5, Clarke 4.5, Jones 5; Pattison 6.5 (Ramshaw 56, 6), Turnbull 6, Gjokaj 5.5 (Chandler, 60, 6), Rodman 7; Oster 6, Rankine 5.5 (Wright 68, 5) Subs not used: Chandler, Shaw, Guy, Allan, Wilson . MOTM: Berahino . Referee: Andrew Madley . Then, in the 42nd minute, Berahino scored a goal from nowhere. And suddenly, dramatically, the roof fell in on Gateshead. When Berahino knocked in his fourth goal — and Albion’s seventh — in the dying seconds, Pulis was obliging the Albion fans with gracious waves and heady optimism was in the air. Naturally, the speculation which has surrounded the young striker’s future was intensified by his latest surge of goals, the more so as he had pointedly declined to celebrate any of them. Pulis handled the question with practised care. ‘Saido Berahino is a very talented boy,’ he said. ‘I look forward with him as a player for however long I am here. ‘There is always going to be transfer speculation and you can see why. He has great pace, great balance and scores goals. But when I came in here the chairman had not received any offer for him and we will try our damndest to try and improve him. ‘I hope he keeps reading the headlines if he scores four every week. Someone said he didn’t celebrate but it was lovely to see all the lads go over when we scored as that showed the unity we’ll need.’ For almost all of the first half, we could see great scope for improvement, but the clinical nature of that opening goal was a declaration of genuine talent. A free-kick from the left was whipped low and fierce by Chris Brunt. It was twice cleared off the line and the loose ball fell to Berahino. The finish was cool and killingly accurate, just as the goal was undeserved. Berahino’s refusal to celebrate may well have been down to simple embarrassment. What followed amounted to cruelty. Playing the single minute of added time, Berahino slid a short pass into the path of Victor Anichebe. For the first time in the afternoon, the striker reacted with something like alacrity, turning his marker, striking the shot early and scoring with some ease. Pulis headed for the dressing room and he was not preparing to distribute bouquets. Anichebe gives West Brom a two-goal advantage just before the half-time whistle with a powerful finish .

But the gods had turned on the Conference side and, within a minute of the second half, the match was effectively over. Once again Berahino was the instrument, moving to the fringe of the area and firing off a stunningly precise shot high into the Gateshead net. Once again his goal was marked with a stony stare and the hint of a shrug. The hat-trick arrived in the 53rd minute, with Chris Baird making ground down the right and Berahino nonchalantly converting the cross. His uncelebrated hat-trick had been scored within nine minutes. When the fifth goal rolled in a minute later, with Brunt outpacing a dishevelled defence, the Conference team yearned for closure. ‘Pulis, Pulis, give us a wave’, pleaded the Albion fans. He obliged, with the air of one who always knew the plot would work out like this.

James Morrison’s tap-in after 78 minutes simply confirmed Gateshead’s collapse. Then the merciless Berahino took his fourth to confirm the rout. The Gateshead manager Gary Mills knew just how harshly the fates had treated his team but he reacted with dignity. ‘We knew we weren’t going to win the competition,’ he said. ‘But we wanted to give a good account of ourselves.’ He now redoubles his efforts to ascend from the Conference. Despite the size of the defeat, he should know that his side emerges with genuine credit. As for Pulis, he smoothly stalled inquiries about Berahino’s apparent indifference to his goals and prepared himself for ‘a big transfer window’. One imagines that he also started to formulate the speech he will deliver in training tomorrow. For seven goals are all very well, but the real work is just beginning.

"It's doubtful Kenny McDowall was even aware of the fierce winds buffeting Murray Park yesterday. Every way the Rangers caretaker manager turns just now, a new storm is brewing. Not three weeks into his new role, the former assistant manager must already feel he’s been occupying the chair for a lifetime. Already devoid of his star player in Lewis Macleod, each day of the January transfer window is a trial. If only that was the sum total of his worries. Kenny McDowall has filled in as caretaker manager at Rangers during turbulent times at the club . Star player Lewis Macleod has left Ibrox, joining Championship high-fliers Brentford . Former Fulham manager Felix Magath is reportedly eyeing the role of technical director at Rangers . In the past week alone, McDowall has seen both Ian Cathro and Felix Magath separately linked with coaching and technical director positions respectively at the club. It can safely be assumed they would not be hired to complement the remainder of the backroom team. More immediately, Rangers are rapidly running out of money. Further loans will be required to see them through January unless unforeseen funds can be raised by selling further players. Sensing the existing board are running out of rabbits to pull from the hat, Dave King, the group known colloquially as the Three Bears and American financier Robert Sarver are manoeuvring independently but with the common goal of usurping the Easdale brothers and Mike Ashley from their positions of power. It would be a brave man to wager on who will be sitting in which seat when the music stops. Somewhere amid the relentless tumult, McDowall has to put a football team on the park that stands half a chance of eating into Hearts’ 13 point lead at the top of the Championship. Little wonder he fielded an enquiry relating to his enjoyment of the job yesterday with a broad grin as opposed to robotically answering in the affirmative. ‘I am not going to kid you on, it is a big job,’ was his diplomatic reply. ‘It is an absolute honour to be in charge of Glasgow Rangers, whether it is caretaker or manager or whatever post. ‘At the moment, I am at the helm and I have to try to get this team winning games and see where that goes. Robert Sarver (right), owner of baseball side Phoenix Suns, has tabled a bid to purchase a stake in Rangers . McDowall has stepped into the role of caretaker manager after the departure of Ally McCoist . ‘In terms of getting easier, I know the boys well and I have worked with them long enough. It is not as if a whole lot has changed and I have been flung into a bunch of guys I don’t know. I know them, they know me and we carry on regardless.’ There was a time under Ally McCoist’s watch where team meetings to enlighten the squad about off-field matters seemed only sensible. Had that continued into 2015, McDowall, you suspect, would be spending more time around a table than on the training field. ‘They are human beings like anyone else,’ the caretaker boss added. ‘They read the papers and get to know what is going on. ‘If you choose to, you can get to know as much as you want to know. When they go out they are professional football players, it is our job to get them concentrating and enjoying their work. ‘That is all we can do to get their minds off it: have a bright week, get them up for it and then come Saturday. ‘In terms of having meetings, I don’t think that does anything apart from highlight there is stuff going on. We go the opposite way if we can.’ McDowall stonewalled the notion of Cathro – the Taysider who is now assistant manager at Valencia – returning to Scotland. Ian Cathro, the assistant manager at Valencia, has been linked with the manager's role at Rangers . ‘I am the caretaker manager at the moment. There is no point me worrying about anything apart from trying to beat Alloa. You could go crazy if you worried about everything that was in the paper.’ Considering the fanfare that previously accompanied the elevation of men to the Rangers post, it’s impossible not to sympathise with McDowall – an individual who didn’t seek to be at the centre of this maelstrom. He’s not been short on sympathy or advice. ‘I have been speaking to a lot of people who I have worked with or know through the years,’ he added. ‘People in the game understand the situation. Listen, I just have to do what I have to do. I have a good group of boys in there and I have to get them going, motivate them as far as I can. ‘Walter (Smith) always used to say to the players when he was in charge that the motivational side has to come from within. A coach or a manger can motivate so far but it has to be self-motivation as well on their behalf to win and to want to achieve. The boys know that.’ If the mere mention of Alloa doesn’t get the blood pumping in the Rangers dressing room then all hope of pipping Hearts to automatic promotion is surely lost. Rangers have failed to beat Alloa in all three of their attempts to do so this season . Three times this season the Ibrox men have set out to defeat Barry Smith’s part-timers and three times they’ve failed - with a capitulation from two goals up in the semi-final of the Petrofac Training Cup the nadir. ‘They let themselves down on the night - and our support who back them wherever we go,’ McDowall lamented. ‘I am sure they will want to fix it for them as well. A bit of personal pride would come into it.’ Stevie Smith can count himself as one of the lucky ones. Suspension and a family matter ensured he only had to watch what passed for a performance at the Indodrill Stadium that night from afar. ‘I was suspended and I wasn’t there,’ he recalled. ‘My brother Christopher was getting married and I was at my mum’s the night before. ‘I saw it was 2-0 to us and then I saw it went to 3-2 and couldn’t believe it myself. These things shouldn’t happen, but it did happen and we’ve got to go and put it right tomorrow. My brother was watching it as well.’ With Hearts still to lose a league game, Rangers’ best hope of seeing their season have a happy ending appears to rest with successfully negotiating the play-offs. Stevie Smith was suspended when Rangers lost 3-2 against Alloa and surrendered a two-goal advantage . Smith acknowledged that, if such a scenario comes to pass, only a radical improvement on the display his side turned in at Easter Road two weeks ago will suffice. ‘They were night and day by far the better team and deserved to beat us convincingly which, from our point of view, isn’t good enough,’ he said. ‘It was so far from good enough it was incredible. You have to take your hat off to them and say they played really well on the day but we never turned up and that’s been the case for the majority of the big games this season. ‘But it’s not a worry to me (playing Hibs in a play-off). It’s quite a bit away and there’s a lot of football to be played and the talk about play-offs or catching Hearts...there’s still a lot to happen. ‘I would like to think we would be playing better by then because everyone knows the performances haven’t been great.'","Financially troubled  Rangers in action against Alloa at the weekned .

"Those who braved the freezing temperatures and turned up excited by the prospect of a repeat of last season's thrilling FA Cup final would leave bitterly cold and bitterly disappointed. Unlike at Wembley, last May, the magic glow was absent. And on a day of squad rotation, rare sightings, unexpected returns and cameo appearances, Arsene Wenger relied on his two workhorses to extend a proud record in this competition. Per Mertesacker, criticised to the point of ridicule during recent defensive malfunctions, scored his first goal of the season while Alexis Sanchez celebrated his 16th with a high-energy display which makes a mockery of the idea all players are on their knees after the Christmas programme.

Ratings by MATT BARLOW at the Emirates . Wenger has won the trophy five times, he has never been beaten in the third round and an upset never really seemed on the cards. Arsenal kept their first clean sheet in eight games to soothe the mental scars of their self-destruction on New Year's Day at Southampton, and Hull performed with an air of a team not too disappointed to crash out of a competition they almost won eight months ago. Steve Bruce made 10 changes, a clear hint that his priorities are elsewhere as his casualty list lengthens. Liam Rosenior and Gaston Ramirez are his latest injury concerns, there is sickness in the squad and he was keen to rest midfielders Jake Livermore and David Meyler, who had clocked nearly 50 kilometres each in three games after Christmas. 'It wasn't a case of disrespecting the FA Cup because it gave us one of the best days of our lives last year,' said Bruce but, despite his protestations, the idea that it didn't matter if they lost seemed to have slipped into the minds of his players, if only subconsciously. The team selection confirmed what they knew already. Survival in the Barclays Premier League is the key. 'It was a fair result,' added Bruce. 'We huffed and puffed but we had no cutting edge to bring the tie alive. We didn't create any real chances, and there was not enough in the final third which is a bit disappointing.' Wenger picked a stronger team, but then he had few options. He would have liked to have rested Sanchez, he confessed but could not afford to with Olivier Giroud banned, Danny Welbeck injured and Lukas Podolski in Italy completing his loan move to Inter Milan. Mertesacker has started 27 of his team's last 28 Arsenal games and was one of only survivors from the team Wenger picked at Wembley in May. Santi Cazorla was the other. Sanchez made his 28th start of the season. 'He recovers very quickly and doesn't look to have fatigue problems, according to our tests,' said Wenger, who must hope the tests are accurate. Any injury to Sanchez would be a devastating blow to Arsenal's season. 'I was tempted to rest him but Giroud was suspended and this was an important game for us,' Wenger added. 'He feels always ready and when you look at the players with that confidence you are always torn between keeping them playing and giving them a rest.

Arsenal players rush to congratulate Mertesacker after the German centre-half opens the scoring . 'He is always dangerous. He took the corner for the first goal and scored a goal. He was lively and penetrating. And he is interesting to watch because he has a good fighting spirit.' Sanchez created the first chance of the game - Joel Campbell was denied by Steve Harper - and took the corner from which Mertesacker leapt above Curtis Davie to nod Arsenal into the lead. He also skipped around Harper, moments later, only for Paul McShane to summon a terrific sliding clearance. It was McShane's first appearance in two months since a row with Bruce which deepened when the defender took it onto social media. 'He played very, very well, he's apologised and it's over,' said the Hull manager. As Arsenal dominated, Harper saved again from Theo Walcott, who started for the first time since last season's FA Cup third round tie against Tottenham when he damaged cruciate knee ligaments and still appeared short of full power. Arsenal limited Hull to occasional counter-attacks and threats from set-pieces and Bruce spent much of the game shaking his head and muttering under his breath. Tom Ince fired wide in the first-half and both McShane and Harry Maguire saw headers saved by David Ospina, in goal for Arsenal as Wojciech Szczesny was rested. Hull offered more adventure after the interval but again Harper was the busier keeper, saving another low strike from Sanchez. Campbell and Walcott wasted good chances before Sanchez settled the nerves, eight minutes from time when he twisted into space on the edge of the Hull penalty box and swept a low shot inside the post. The FA Cup holders are into the fourth round and only Sergio Aguero and Harry Kane have more goals for top-flight teams than Sanchez. 'Well, there's no sign of him being tired,' said Bruce. 'He's world class and his appetite and desire is what every player should look at.' Perhaps he was thinking of some of his own players when he said this.

"Arsenal forward Theo Walcott has expressed delight at regaining his fitness and revealed he is eager to make up for lost time and form a partnership with Alexis Sanchez. Walcott was handed his first start of the season as the Gunners beat Hull 2-0 in their FA Cup clash courtesy of goals from Per Mertesacker and former Barcelona star Sanchez. The 25-year-old has been watching his new team-mate from the sideline this season and admitted he was pleased to finally link up with him on the pitch.

It's been a year now, it was good to blow cobwebs away. I'm not putting too much pressure on myself. It was nice to get a start and as long as I'm getting in those chances I'm pleased.' The England forward is no stranger to lengthy spells out injured and stressed the separation from his team-mates was the most difficult aspect. He said: 'Mentally the main target is to see how you can cope with your team-mates going out to training and your the only one in the rehab room its difficult like that but I had a lot of personal things in my life that took my mind off it.' Manager Arsene Wenger, meanwhile, was pleased with Walcott's return, even if he didn't convert the chances presented to him.

"David Ospina is set to start only his second Arsenal game in the FA Cup against Hull, with Arsene Wenger claiming he has been a victim of 'post World Cup trauma'. The Colombia goalkeeper, who will come in for Wojciech Szczesny, has struggled with injuries since moving to London from Nice last summer. 'David had a difficult start to the season,' said Wenger.

'Because he came to a new club, he wanted to get back fit as quickly as possible and got injured again.' Ospina spent six years in France and Wenger added: 'I believe he is a great goalkeeper with a good understanding of the game and fantastic reflexes. 'He displayed that when he came on against Galatasaray at home in October. He made some fantastic saves and I think he has a great future.'

The French international has been linked with a switch to Arsenal, who are in the market for a defensive midfielder this winter, as well as with a reunion with Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham.

"Cameron Jerome curled home a glorious winner as the Alex Neil era at Norwich City started in perfect fashion as leaders Bournemouth were left stunned. Collecting the ball 25 yards from goal, Norwich’s No 10 took one touch to shift the ball and unleashed an unstoppable shot that soared past goalkeeper Artur Boruc and into the top corner. It was even more remarkable given that Norwich were down to 10 men following Jonny Howson’s reckless tackle on Yann Kermorgant, which left the visitors numerically disadvantaged for the last half-an-hour. Cameron Jerome runs over to the away fans to celebrate his winner with his jubilant Norwich team-mates . Bournemouth midfielder Matt Ritchie celebrates his first half opener against Alex Neil's Norwich . Chris Foy shows Jonny Howson the red card after his challenge on French striker Yann Kermorgant .

Substitutes not used: Camp (GK); Smith, O’Kane, Stanislas . Scorer: Ritchie 18 . Booked: Ritchie, Cook . Norwich City: Ruddy; Whittaker (R.

Scorers: Hooper 36; Jerome 80 . Booked: Olsson, Jerome . Sent off: Howson . Referee: Chris Foy (Lancashire) Attendance: 11,318 (1,438 away) The win was a deserved one - few sides have come to the Goldsands Stadium this season and matched Eddie Howe’s title-chasers like this. Norwich had fallen behind to Matt Ritchie’s opener but levelled through Gary Hooper and successfully muted Bournemouth’s free-scoring attack. It meant the ideal start for Neil, the 33-year-old who moved down to Norfolk from Hamilton Academical this week, and who observed from the stands after giving his first team talk. Neil, who replaces Neil Adams, who resigned on Monday after nine months at the helm, now has something solid to build upon as the Canaries chase the play-off places. The unexpected result ended Bournemouth’s unbeaten league run at 14 and keeps this most fascinating of title races wide open. With nearest challengers Ipswich losing at home to Derby in the lunchtime match, the Cherries knew they would end the afternoon top of the table unless they found themselves on the wrong end of a hiding. Eddie Howe had taken the opportunity to rest some of his big names in last weekend’s FA Cup tie at Rotherham - they still won 5-1 - but Callum Wilson, Harry Arter, Marc Pugh and Co returned here. Norwich were also much-changed from the side that lost 2-0 at Preston in the FA Cup seven days ago, with caretaker boss Mike Phelan restoring Jerome, Alex Tettey and Martin Olsson among others. And the visitors started the brighter with Bradley Johnson heading narrowly over the crossbar in the third minute after Redmond had retrieved Olsson’s over-hit ball wide on the right. Bournemouth manager Eddie Howe looks on as his side take an early lead against Norwich via Matt Ritchie . Callum Wilson (left) tries his luck from range and Martin Olsson (right) is tracked by goalscorer Matt Ritchie . Bournemouth midfielder Harry Arter is tackled by Norwich's Alexander Tettey at the Goldsands Stadium . New manager Neil, watching on from the stands at the Goldsands Stadium, wouldn’t have been too impressed when Steven Whittaker was slow in clearing his lines and allowed Wilson to steal in and fire just wide from 25 yards. Norwich had been the better side in the opening exchanges but Wilson’s warning wasn’t heeded. On 18 minutes, Charlie Daniels slipped Pugh clear down the left and he broke beyond Whittaker to deliver the ball. Ritchie had timed his back post run to perfection and, after the ball evaded everyone, ghosted in to fire home his seventh of the season. It could have been two midway through the first-half when the ball sat up invitingly for Pugh after Wilson’s crafty flick. His volley was firm but a little too high. Alex Neil finds his bearings ahead of his first game in charge of Norwich against high-flying Bournemouth . With Redmond making a nuisance of himself on one wing, Olsson unafraid to maraud forward on the other and Tettey storming through the centre, Norwich carried a decent threat and would soon be level. Bournemouth were given notice when Jerome, twisting and turning near the byline, did exceptionally well to turn back inside and forced Boruc, whose loan from Southampton was this week extended, to block with his legs. Five minutes later though, the Pole could do nothing as Hooper blasted home from close range after Turner’s flick header from Redmond’s corner. After a low-key start to the second period, the game sparked into life once again when Jonny Howson was shown a straight red card for a very rash two-footed tackle on Yann Kermorgant. Charlie Daniels (right) and Nathan Redmond battle for the ball at a chilly Goldsands Stadium . To compound Norwich’s woes, Ryan Bennett pulled up with an injury just a few minutes after coming on and had to be replaced by Gary O’Neil. As expected, the final 20 minutes were a red and black onslaught. Ritchie curled a shot narrowly wide of the far post after Arter charged down the right and pulled the ball back. And a few minutes later, Ritchie cut infield from the right and sent a low drive close enough to the near post to have John Ruddy scrambling. But then, incredibly, the 10-men went in front thanks to Jerome’s moment of magic. Proof, as if it were needed, that you should always expect the unexpected in football.

"The FA Cup third round will be the first set of fixtures of 2016 - avoiding the congestion which disrupted this year’s competition.

The Premier League are keen to avoid a repeat of the congestion which plagued this year’s festive period and that is one of the reasons why next season’s league fixtures will kick off on Saturday, August 8, a week earlier than normal. This is also because of Euro 2016 - starting on June 10 - and the Champions League final, May 28, which mean the Premier League campaign must finish earlier than last year.

"American clothing brand Under Armour has confirmed a four-year kit deal with Andy Murray, bringing to an end the British No 1's clothing association with adidas. As revealed by Sportsmail, Under Armour - who kit out Tottenham Hotspur, skier Lindsey Vonn and golfer Jordan Spieth - were the frontrunners in negotiations for Murray's new clothing contract as his five-year deal with adidas came to an end.

"West Ham winger Matt Jarvis has his sights set on making up for lost time with an extended run in the first team. The Irons laboured through a 1-1 draw against West Brom on Thursday, after two gruelling Barclays Premier League fixtures against Chelsea and Arsenal. Manager Sam Allardyce's squad will welcome extra recovery time from the hectic Christmas schedule as their FA Cup third-round tie at Everton will not be played until Tuesday night. Matt Jarvis will be hoping for an extended run in the West Ham team during January . Jarvis came off the bench against the Baggies, who were watched at Upton Park by new manager Tony Pulis, and offered some threat down the flanks. With Senegal duo Cheikhou Kouyate and Diafra Sakho set to head to the Africa Cup of Nations, former Wolves midfielder Jarvis is hoping to make the most of any more opportunities having spent a spell out earlier in the season following a thigh injury. 'It has been very frustrating for me, but when you get a chance to play, you have to do well and hopefully I have done that,' said Jarvis, who has made just four appearances since October. 'I was extremely disappointed to get injured before the start of the season, that has cost me, but now I am back to being fully fit and trying to get back into the team.' After taking just one point from three matches, West Ham stand in seventh place, yet still within striking distance of the top four. Hammers boss Sam Allardyce issues instructions to his team during the 1-1 draw against West Brom . Jarvis said: 'The two games before were very hard fixtures and it would have been for any team. 'We were disappointed not to have taken all three points against West Brom, but it is another point and we keep going.' Sakho, who headed West Ham into an early lead before Saido Berahino equalised for West Brom, is set for a scan on his back after being substituted during the second half. However he would have been unavailable for the Everton match anyway under FIFA regulations for international release. Allardyce admits the scheduling of the cup fixture came as something of a surprise. He said: 'It is a big FA Cup third-round tie on a Tuesday night, which is a bit bizarre and something I don't think I have done before. 'But it gives the lads time to rest and recover and make sure we can put a team out to try to get through to the next round.'","Matt Jarvis made his first West Ham appearance in over two months as a second-half substitute in the 1-1 draw against West Brom on Thursday .

"Click here to read the match report from Huish Park . This attractive Somerset town hadn’t seen an occasion like this for a while. Yeovil's reputation for giantkilling as a non-league outfit was well-established but it’s been a while now since they got one over on a big name. With the whole world watching on, was this going to be their day? Enthusiasm in the town centre was much in evidence. Shop windows were bedecked in anything and everything green and white; paper pull-out pictures of the boys hoping to topple the mighty Manchester United adorned the window of the estate agent, the butcher, the baker. One Yeovil Town fan holds up a banner mocking Manchester United ahead of the FA Cup third round clash . Gary Johnson ducks down to greet opposing manager Louis van Gaal in the dugout at Huish Park . Thousands of home fans greeted the United team coach as it arrived in Somerset, (pictured Radamel Falcao) Opportunistic merchants hawked jester hats and half-and-half scarves from supermarket shopping trollies. But with the shopping precinct freezing and deserted, it may have been a hard sell. At Huish Park, those lucky enough to have secured tickets were giddy with excitement. Some darted straight for the turnstiles, seeking to secure the best vantage point on the terracing behind the goal. The home faithful were in fantastic voice 90 minutes before the start. Others, in a scrum 20-deep, waited for the United team coach to arrive. Fans from eight to eighty stood around in anticipation, reminiscing and dreaming. Some might even have long enough in the tooth to recall the last time these two teams met, back in February 1949. United won 8-0 on that occasion. When the gigantic vehicle rolled up, a hundred camera phones emerged from pockets and a hundred heads popped up, hoping to catch a fleeting glimpse of Wayne Rooney or Angel di Maria. Sir Alex Ferguson makes his way towards Huish Park after a helicopter ride to watch United . We wanted City! Yeovil fans pose with a flag suggesting they weren't quite happy with drawing the Red Devils . Kieffer Moore is idolised here by one young fan who doesn't appear to rate Wayne Rooney . Led by Sir Bobby Charlton, the United players filed in. Saying nothing, heads down, minds focused. This was not a day for anything else. Sir Alex Ferguson chose a rather swifter mode of transport to get here, flying in by helicopter. 'I saw the back of Falcao's head,' said one wide-eyed young fan as the scrum dissipated. 'Well, I saw Rooney AND Di Maria,' countered his mate. The club shop, a portakabin painted green, offered thousands of Yeovil programmes from yesteryear but few, if any, occasions were as prestigious as this. The matchday programme, selling like hotcakes at £5 a pop outside, was a 96-page opus, really something special to keep. Four pages of which were devoted to autographs should any fan be lucky enough to get near the visiting superstars. Gary Johnson, the Yeovil manager and as close as they get to a living legend around here, wanted his players to get close to United on the pitch - but not too close. One United fan tries to get his fellow supporters going as he stands above the crowd on his chair . United captain Rooney lines up to take a free-kick with the Huish Park ground packed to the rafters . Wayne Rooney leads out Manchester United in front of a bumper crowd while Joe Edwards captains Yeovil . He ordered them not to ask Rooney, Di Maria, Falcao et al for ‘selfies’ afterwards or swap shirts, lest it distract from the task in hand. There certainly wasn’t a welcoming committee once the match started - inside the first minute, Chris Smalling was hurried into a sliced clearance and Yeovil forward Kieffer Moore clattered into David De Gea. The first chance fell to home captain Joseph Edwards, United’s £150m+ line-up taken aback. Unlike those fabled Cup mudbaths of yore, the surface was immaculate and United soon settled into their familiar passing rhythm. Every time one of their moves broke down, a hearty cheer arose from the terrace. Danger averted for a few minutes more. But Yeovil were dogged, putting United under pressure. Rooney and Falcao were pressed into defensive chores, while Paddy McNair and Moore were left dazed after a clash of heads. Both resumed wearing thick bandages. Ander Herrera netted a superb volley as Manchester United beat Yeovil Town 2-0 on Sunday . The Spaniard celebrates scoring  at Huish Park as United advanced to the fourth round . Angel di Maria celebrates after securing United's victory with a late chipped effort in the last minute . You lost track of the number of hurried clearances Smalling and Tyler Blackett put straight out of play. Rafael’s pace was electric but always in the wrong direction. It took the 20-time champions of England over half-an-hour to register a shot, a James Wilson daisy-cutter that didn’t trouble Jed Steer in net. United’s first-half funk seemed to be summed up when captain Rooney hit a basic 10-yard pass wide left to Luke Shaw with such force it went out into touch. They had been truly lacklustre. Van Gaal threw on Juan Mata and Jonny Evans at half-time, searching desperately for impetus. Quite what Mata and United’s other overseas players made of it all, I don’t know. Things could have been even worse for them. 10 minutes after the break, Samuel Foley’s cross fell invitingly for Moore to strike one. Dead centre, not too many yards out, he scuffed it and De Gea got down. A golden chance. They were always likely to pay for it. Duly, on 63 minutes, Ander Herrera produced a superb volley on the turn to spark wild celebrations in the away end. It was a spectacular goal quite out of keeping with United’s performance. The home crowd tried to urge a second wind from their now-flagging players. The shrill sound of a rattle could be heard above the din. Yeovil players look dejected after United's first goal, but they should be proud of their performance . They nearly had an equaliser too, Edwards heading towards goal at the back post and denied by the unlikely figure of substitute Di Maria, whose introduction had sparked chants of ‘what a waste of money’ from the locals. United were able to see out the closing stages in rarely-afforded comfort, especially after Di Maria surged 50 yards to dink the ball over Steer and make absolutely sure of their progress. ‘We’re going to Wembley,’ sang the United fans, finally able to relax. For Yeovil, it wasn’t to be their day. But everyone present, from eight to eighty, will never forget the day Rooney, Falcao, Di Maria and co played in their backyard. And were not given one inch.","Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria scored goals in Manchester United win .

"Louis van Gaal has a new crop of injury concerns after Manchester United overcame Yeovil Town 2-0 in a bruising FA Cup third round tie. Rafael da Silva suffered a fractured cheekbone in a first-half aerial duel and had to be taken off at half time, while his defensive partner Paddy McNair needed staples in his head after a sickening clash with Kieffer Moore. Van Gaal also revealed that another defender, Luke Shaw, had suffered a fresh ankle problem after he too was withdrawn at the break after playing through the pain barrier.

Luke Shaw (left), pictured tussling with Yeovil's Simon Gillett, was taken off at half-time with an ankle injury . The Dutch manager has been plagued by injuries since arriving at Old Trafford and the latest casualties join Ashley Young, Marcos Rojo, Antonio Valencia, Daley Blind and Marouane Fellaini on the treatment table. Van Gaal said: 'I think we had a lot of problems in the first half. You noticed that Rafa Da Silva has an injury, a fissure of his bone. 'It was fantastic that he played through [until half-time] but I had to change him and also Luke Shaw has an ankle problem so I had to change him also.' United were pushed hard by the League One strugglers at Huish Park but prevailed thanks to second-half goals from Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria. Van Gaal was full of praise for Yeovil and their 'fantastic' performance. He said: 'I have to give my highest respect to the managers and the players.

United defender McNair has his head stapled after suffering a cut in the accidental collision . 'In the first-half they didn't give us any time to us to play the ball, there was a lot of pressure. In the second, you don't know whether it is us or the tiredness of their players. 'It was fantastic how they pressed the ball. It is more difficult to beat the pressure. In the second half we played better but it also takes a long time to score the goal because it is not so easy. 'Everyone thinks ""OK, these players are from Man United, 100m euros against 5,000 euros"" but it is not like that. 'We played also with the Netherlands against teams who are much more expensive in the World Cup but you can organise your team like the manager of Yeovil has done and when they believe in it, you can do a lot.' Johnson's men were tenacious and matched United for long spells, their resistance only broken when Herrera produced a sensational volley on 64 minutes. Spanish midfielder Ander Herrera opened the scoring with a stunning strike at Huish Park . United boss Louis van Gaal shakes hands with Yeovil manager Gary Johnson ahead of kick-off . Di Maria, introduced from the bench with 30 minutes left, made sure there would be no upset when Rooney played him clear to sprint 50 yards and clip in a second. Johnson said: 'The game was bittersweet, I'm so proud of the boys for the effort they put in. We wanted to affect the game and give them a fright. 'I thought we did that, we had that first chance before we did that.

"Andy Murray is continuing his pre-season training in Dubai as the British No 1 steps up his preparations for the Australian Open. After several weeks at his training base in Miami, followed by a few days in Scotland for Christmas, Murray is now in the United Arab Emirates ahead of his first match of the new year on Thursday.

"Sportsmail analyses what we learned from the latest round of fixtures in the Premier League as we head into the new year. 1. Cesc Fabregas has topped the charts for making chances and completing passes, but there’s one more stat he should be less proud of. The former Arsenal and Barcelona midfielder’s poor challenge on Tottenham’s Jan Vertonghen near the end of Chelsea’s 5-3 defeat at White Hart Lane was his eighth yellow card of the season. One of those – wrongly given for diving when he was fouled against Southampton – might have been bad luck but the rest of them suggest that Fabregas needs to tidy up his tackling. Chelsea midfielder Cesc Fabregas has already picked up eight yellow cards this season . 2. Alex Bruce’s return from a hamstring injury has made a major contribution to helping dad Steve out of the crisis developing at Hull. The Tigers now have two wins in four games since the 30-year-old central defender, fighting to win a new contract at the KC Stadium when his current deal runs out at the end of the season, returned to the starting line-up. Against Everton he was Hull’s best defender, making 13 clearances and finding a team-mate with 100 per cent of his passes. Alex Bruce (right, challenging Arouna Kone) has returned from a hamstring injury to ease his dad's worries . 3. Stephane Sessegnon was anxious to impress new West Brom boss Tony Pulis as he watched at Upton Park before taking over. The former Sunderland man, dragged off with nearly half an hour left of Sunday’s 2-0 defeat at Stoke, made Albion’s goal in the 1-1 draw for Saido Berahino and created four other chances as well as having four shots of his own. It meant he was involved in nine of his side’s 14 attempts on goal. Stephane Sessegnon was involved in nine of West Brom's 14 attempts against West Ham on New Year's Day . 4. Eliaquim Mangala is slowly settling into Manchester City’s defence after a torrid start to his Premier League career following his £32million transfer from Porto. The 23-year-old French international has now played seven games in a row while skipper Vincent Kompany has been missing. Against Sunderland he was the most effective defender, with his 10 clearances as many as the rest of City’s back four put together. Eliaquim Mangala (right) had a torrid start to his Premier League career but was effective against Sunderland . 5. Joe Cole’s season at Aston Villa is turning into a flop – despite the absence of both Fabian Delph and Kieran Richardson through suspension the 33-year-old was still only on the bench for the 0-0 draw with Palace. Cole did get on for the final eight minutes but got no more than five touches of the ball in that time. Joe Cole could not get into Aston Villa's team despite injuries to Fabian Delph and Kieran Richardson . 6. George Boyd continues to be the Premier League’s running man – the Burnley midfielder smashed his own record for the greatest distance covered in a top-flight game this season by hitting 8.4 miles at Manchester City. The 29-year-old, who went further than anybody else on both Boxing Day and December 28 with 8.1 miles each time, still had enough energy left to score the late equaliser that snatched a crucial point for Sean Dyche’s side at Newcastle. George Boyd is the Premier League's running man, registering 8.4 miles against Manchester City . 7. Leicester will miss the pace in wide positions of Jeff Schlupp when the 22-year-old is away playing for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations. Schlupp, born in Germany but brought up in England by Ghanaian parents, scored in the 2-2 draw at Anfield and Liverpool were constantly troubled by the running of both him and Jamie Vardy. Vardy recorded a top speed of 21.7mph – quicker than the best of 21.5mph registered by Raheem Sterling. Schlupp was Leicester’s second fastest at 20.8mph. Jeff Schlupp will be missed by Leicester when he leaves to play for Ghana in the Africa Cup of Nations . 8. Robin van Persie is having a difficult time in Louis van Gaal’s Manchester United system, as the map showing he had only 17 touches of the ball in the 1-1 draw at Stoke proved. But the Dutch World Cup star is certainly trying to get involved. He made 67 sprints during the game, the most by any United player at the Britannia Stadium. Robin van Persie only had 17 touches of the ball in Manchester United's 1-1 draw against Stoke . 9. Dusan Tadic was Ronald Koeman’s first signing after taking over Southampton and the £10.9million midfielder is emerging as one of the best. The 26-year-old Serbia international scored one of the goals that beat Arsenal and set up three other chances as Saints moved back into fourth place. Only Steven Davis made more successful passes than his 20 in Arsenal’s half – and for good measure Tadic also made more tackles than any other player on the pitch. Dusan Tadic was Ronald Koeman's first signing as Southampton manager and he may well be the best . 10. France international Bafetimbi Gomis has struggled at Swansea since his summer free transfer move from Lyon, with only one goal from 16 appearances, even if all but four of them have been as a sub. He had 10 attempts in all at Queens Park Rangers (with only two of them on target) before Wilfried Bony then came on to grab an equaliser for Garry Monk’s team. At 29 and with 12 international caps behind him, Gomis should have known better than to be caught offside three times. Only West Ham’s Diafro Sakho (five) was flagged up more during the New Year’s Day games. Bafetimbi Gomis hasn't had as big an impact as expected at Swansea with just one Premier League goal .","Cesc Fabregas tops the charts for chances, passes... and yellow cards .

"This year was bizarrely bookended for Andy Murray, opening with a 6-0, 6-0 thrashing of a Qatari no-hoper and ending with a crushing 6-0, 6-1 loss at the hands of Roger Federer. Detached analysis shows that, in between times, he actually performed pretty well to finish it ranked No 6, considering the turbulence that continually buffeted him. Aside from having to recover from back surgery, there was the loss of the two key coaches in his career, Ivan Lendl and Dani Vallverdu, replaced by the groundreaking appointment of Amelie Mauresmo. For good measure he also lost his main clothing sponsor, threw in the odd politically-contentious tweet and got engaged to long-term girlfriend Kim Sears. Andy Murray trains in the gym in Dubai as he shapes up for the start of the 2015 season . Murray posted this picture on Instagram as he hit with British No 2 James Ward at the Aviation Club in Dubai . Murray and coach Amelie Mauresmo during a training session in Miami earlier in December . None of which gives much clue as to what will happen when this season begins, unofficially on Wednesday, with a low-key exhibition in Abu Dhabi where he is slated to play Spain’s Feliciano Lopez. After that, he represents GB with Heather Watson at the Hopman Cup in Perth, and then it is straight into the Australian Open, an event where he has an admirably consistent record. Yet the truth is that even the most seasoned Murray watcher would struggle to muster much conviction in predicting how he will fare this season. Much of the debate centres on whether Mauresmo can instil a more aggressive intent in him, but more fundamental is whether he can rediscover the self-control that became so evident under Lendl. The amount of yapping at his support box is usually a pretty good guide to his mindset. If we see this spilling over from 2014, and Mauresmo tolerates it as she has done while their relationship beds in, then he is unlikely to regain the place in the top three that his talent should permit. Mauresmo watches on as Murray practices his serve ahead of the new season . Murray started working with Frenchwoman Amelie Mauresmo ahead of Wimbledon in June 2014 . They will be under scrutiny, as many in the game question the wisdom of the arrangement. One ex-Grand Slam champion recently described the decision to hire her as ‘unfathomable’, but was fearful of being accused of sexism if his name was put to that. Murray is not the only big name with questions to answer in 2015. Federer played 85 matches this year, plenty even for such a phenomenal athlete at 33, and his continuing outstanding form will depend much on whether his sometimes troublesome back can take the workload. Rafael Nadal’s last Grand Slam was Wimbledon, and his three comeback tournaments in the autumn yielded just four wins and three defeats. The concerns over his long-term fitness will endure, but he has confounded doubters before. Murray split from coaches Ivan Lendl (right) and Danny Valverdu (left) in 2014 . The partnership has been called into question by many in the game . The man sitting prettiest at the start of the year is, by far, Novak Djokovic. He starts the year 1,585 points ahead of Federer at the top of the rankings and the biggest single issue in the men’s game is whether he can topple Nadal at Roland Garros to complete his Grand Slam collection. You would expect Djokovic to win at least two Grand Slams this year and nudge himself further into the greatest-of-all-time debate. I do not see the landscape at the top of the men’s game changing dramatically this year, but it could be the final season when the now-familiar order remains in place. Likewise it is difficult to see anyone displacing Serena Williams at the top of the WTA Tour for now. Petra Kvitova could be the one, if she can apply herself more consistently. Murray and Mauresmo have been in talks with Loic Courteau (left) about joining the coaching team . From a British perspective there will be longing for Laura Robson to come back fully restored after what will be more than a year out of the game. She will not play in Australia but, if her cautious recovery from wrist surgery remains on track, the likelihood is her return to the top level will be around the time of the premier events at Indian Wells and Miami in March. That could be a significant month for the British game, as it is when Glasgow hosts the biggest Davis Cup tie the country has seen for decades, the World Group first round against the USA. This might also be the year when, belatedly, tennis takes steps to update its product to suit the modern audience, with its shrunken attention span and desire for fast and furious action. Men’s tennis remains — for now — in a golden era and the women’s game is on an upward curve, but nobody can afford to stand still.","Andy Murray split from previous coach Ivan Lendl in March, 2014 .

"West Ham have completed their first signing of the January transfer window with the capture of Canada international Doneil Henry. The Hammers announced the transfer of the 21-year-old defender via their official club website on Saturday. Henry, who has 14 caps for his country, joins on a long-term contract from Cypriot First Division club Apollon Limassol for an undisclosed fee. West Ham have signed defender Doneil Henry for an undisclosed fee Cypriot side Apollon Limassol . The 6'2 defender has been closely monitored by the Irons for a while after having already spent two periods training with the club in recent months. Henry was brought to Upton Park boss Sam Allardyce's attention by Toronto FC head coach Ryan Nelsen. Former defender Nelsen, who played under Allardyce at Blackburn Rovers, recommended the talented Henry after having seen him become the first player to graduate from the MLS side's academy. 'Ryan (Nelsen) was my captain at Blackburn for a couple of years and he rang us and told us about Doneil,' Allardyce told West Ham's official website. 'He said this lad definitely has Premier League potential and he has everything he needs. 'With a little coaching from us and work in terms of how to defend in the Premier League, Ryan says he has all the attributes to be a good player. 'We have invested in him for the near future, so we do hope he can make some sort of appearance this season if he settles in and does as well as Ryan thinks he will. If not, we hope he is certainly one for the future.' The 21-year-old defender (right) became the first player to graduate from MLS side Toronto FC's academy . Henry, who goes straight into the Hammers' first-team squad, is hoping to settle in quickly at his new club. 'It feels good to be given the opportunity to come and train and see what it's like to be part of a Premier League team and I just want to get started and get into the team real soon,' he said. 'I had a really good relationship with Ryan Nelsen and I always wanted to see what it was like to play at another level, the highest level, and I got the opportunity to come over here. Since then, I was just hoping to come back and now it's happened, I want it to continue on and keep playing. 'I started with the Toronto FC Academy when I was 16 and signed for the first-team when I was 17 and now I just want to continue to develop and keep growing as a player. I'm 21 and I want to get a role with the team, keep my head down and take my opportunity when I can. 'I love a tackle and I just want to defend hard. I take pride in my clean sheets with the back line and with the 'keeper, so if we can just do that, it's job completed.'

"Sam Allardyce would not prevent his players from 'making a meal' out of contact if it meant his West Ham side were given the decisions they deserved. The Hammers boss was left irked by referee Neil Swarbrick during Sunday's 2-1 Barclays Premier League defeat to Arsenal at Upton Park after the Gunners were awarded a penalty and the hosts were denied a late spot-kick. Winston Reid was adjudged to have felled Santi Cazorla in the box, with Swarbrick pointing to the spot as the Spaniard went to ground under the challenge, but - with West Ham chasing a stoppage-time equaliser - Morgan Amalfitano decided to stay on his feet when challenged by Kieran Gibbs.

Reid of West Ham and Alex Song react as referee Swarbrick awards a penalty to Arsenal at Upton Park . Cazorla won and scored the penalty against West Ham during the 2-1 win for Arsenal at Upton Park . With both Chelsea and Sunderland profiting from controversial penalty decisions against the Hammers in recent weeks, Allardyce believes going to ground when caught by the opposition may be the only way to bring a foul to the attention of the officials. 'As long as it's not simulation - as long as you get the right decision from it,' he said when asked if a player needed to fall over to get a foul. 'If you're not touched and you go down because you're not touched, that's not the way forward. But if you can't get what you ordinarily should get, then you've got to consider the fact that if you make a meal of it, you make a meal of it because the contact is sufficient enough. 'The contact on Amalfitano was sufficient enough to put him off getting the ball cleanly in that position to try to help us score a goal. It impeded him from getting a better contact on the ball. 'Like I said, that's where a penalty should be given and if that's the case then it would be much better across the board. 'As difficult as it is for referees, those are the decisions that they should be capable of giving. All the other infringements are here and there, if you like, but then when it comes to major decisions, it's how the goal is judged and how the referee is judged. 'A very good game from a referee can't evolve being 99 per cent great and then the one per cent being one major decision he's got wrong, because then he's had a bad game - like a goalkeeper can be brilliant and then all of a sudden he drops one ball and it gets put in the net and he's had it. Allardyce believes going to ground when caught may be the only way to bring a foul to the attention of officials . James Tomkins is suspended and Mauro Zarate (pictured) will play no part in West Ham's game vs West Brom . Tomkins (left) is suspended for their match at Upton Park against West Brom on New Year's Day . 'Unfortunately the referees are not brave enough to give those penalties because, in the surroundings and the atmosphere in the stadiums, it doesn't look like one, but their job is to identify if it is or not.' West Ham welcome managerless West Brom to Upton Park on New Year's Day looking to halt a run of two defeats over the festive period, albeit to Chelsea and Arsenal, with Allardyce having an almost-full squad to select from for the visit of the Baggies. James Tomkins is suspended and Mauro Zarate will play no part as a loan move across London to QPR edges closer. Fellow summer recruit Enner Valencia is likely to be involved and the Ecuador striker is hoping to start 2015 with his first goal in front of the West Ham fans to extend the club's fine start to the season. 'I'm working hard and I want to score a goal at home as soon as possible to thank all the fans for supporting me and making me feel welcome,' the 25-year-old told the club's official website. 'I'm doing all I can to make sure West Ham stay near the top of the Premier League. We've suffered two painful losses recently and we've dropped down the table slightly. 'We know the game against West Brom is a very important one and we'll do our best to get the three points. We want to get 2015 started on the right foot and have a good rest of the season. I know that if I perform well I can help West Ham stay in the upper reaches of the table, so that is my main aim for next year.'

"Andy Carroll and Sam Allardyce are among a group of players and staff at West Ham to have lost £30,000 to fraudsters in a scam, it was claimed on Thursday.

A source told the newspaper: ‘He was offering top quality champagnes and hampers from Harrods and Fortnum & Mason at ridiculously cheap prices. ‘The conman told them he had some good contacts in these firms and assured them it was all legal and above board. They were told stuff would be delivered in a short while.’ Metropolitan Police officers were informed on Christmas Eve and have now begun an investigation.

"Chris Smalling has told his Manchester United team-mates they must fight hard to ensure their unbeaten run stretches long into the new year. Louis van Gaal endured a difficult start to life in England, but his United side are third in the table and are through to the fourth round of the FA Cup after an 11-match unbeaten run. The last time United went on such a run was in Sir Alex Ferguson's final year in charge when the Red Devils went 18 matches without defeat. Man United defender Chris Smalling has called on his team-mates to work even harder to maintain form . Louis van Gaal's side are unbeaten in their last 11 matches - with their last defeat coming against Man City . Provided they beat fourth-place Southampton on Sunday, United's fixture list suggests they have a decent chance of stretching their current sequence to a similar length. Van Gaal's team face QPR, Leicester, West Ham, Burnley, Swansea, Sunderland and Newcastle in the coming weeks, but Smalling knows there is still plenty of hard work ahead if United are to remain unbeaten and cement their position in the top four. 'Going into the New Year on the back of a good run means that it's a case of working even harder to climb the table and get as many points as we can,' the defender told United Uncovered. 'We need to do as much as possible on the pitch and, as an individual, do as much as we can in terms of recovery and extra work.' After taking 13 points from his first 10 matches, Van Gaal was keen to emphasise that United's form would improve once the principles of his philosophy had sunk in with the players. That philosophy has never been explained in public since Van Gaal moved to England, but whatever its components, it is clearly rubbing off on the squad. 'I think the key is to keep to the principles that the manager has set,' Smalling added . 'The run shows that we've got a bit of consistency. Smalling appeared in Manchester United's last match against League One outfit Yeovil Town . Louis van Gaal revealed on Friday that Ashley Young was Manchester United's only injured player . 'I think we've really shown our team spirit in games where we've had to dig in or come from behind. It shows how well we all get on. 'We're all happy no matter what position we're in and we work for each other. 'If we can prolong our consistency and continue our hard work in training, things will click and we'll creep up the league.' Van Gaal is likely to stick with his favoured 3-5-2 formation due to some encouraging news from the treatment room. The Dutchman smiled broadly when he revealed only one player - Ashley Young - was unavailable for Sunday's game against his old adversary Ronald Koeman. Luke Shaw has overcome an ankle injury and is fit to face his old club and Daley Blind is also in contention after a two-month knee injury layoff. Rafael has trained this week despite fracturing his cheekbone against Yeovil, but Van Gaal is unlikely to take a gamble on the Brazilian as Antonio Valencia is back after a groin strain. Luke Shaw and Rafael da Silva are both available to face Southampton on Sunday afternoon . 'They [Shaw and Rafael] can play,' the United boss said. 'They are both not injured. Rafael Da Silva was of course operated on [his cheekbone], and maybe we don't take any risk with him, but Shaw can also play.' Van Gaal is facing a dilemma regarding whether to play Angel di Maria, who was deemed fit enough only for a substitute appearance in the 2-0 FA Cup win over Yeovil. 'Angel di Maria has only played 20 minutes because of the match rhythm I gave him,' Van Gaal said of the Argentine, who missed three matches over the festive period because of a hamstring injury. 'I have said I only have one injured player but I don't have 100 per cent match-fit players. 'I have to select the best team and watch the qualities of Southampton.'","Chris Smalling has been pleased with his side's recent results .

Here is all the information you need for Arsenal's home clash with Stoke... Arsenal vs Stoke City (Emirates Stadium) Team news . Arsenal . Arsene Wenger has welcomed a trio of players back into his squad ahead of Sunday's Barclays Premier League visit of Stoke. Aaron Ramsey (hamstring) and Mesut Ozil (knee) are all available, as is striker Olivier Giroud who returns following suspension. Mesut Ozil (centre) is tracked by Tottenham's Erik Lamela and Ryan Mason earlier this season and the Arsenal midfielder could make his first appearance for three months after recovering from injury . Wenger will also have to decide whether to recall Wojciech Szczesny after David Ospina deputised in the FA Cup third round win over Hull, while Danny Welbeck (thigh), Mikel Arteta, Abou Diaby (both calf) and Jack Wilshere (ankle) are still absent. Provisional squad: Szczesny, Ospina, Monreal, Chambers, Koscielny, Mertesacker, Bellerin, Debuchy, Coquelin, Ramsey, Flamini, Rosicky, Oxlade-Chamberlain, Cazorla, Walcott, Ozil, Sanchez, Campbell, Akpom, Maitland-Niles.

Peter Crouch has scored eight Premier League goals against Arsenal; his joint-highest tally against any opponent (along with Blackburn). 33 points after 20 games is Arsenal's lowest points tally in the league since 1994-95 when they finished 12th. Arsenal have fielded 12 different starting back four combinations in the Premier League this season. Mark Hughes has never won a Premier League game away at Arsenal as an opposition coach, losing all seven visits (with five different clubs). Peter Crouch took just 19 seconds to score as Stoke City defeated Arsenal 3-2 at the Britannia Stadium back in December's reverse Premier League fixture . The Gunners have won their last 12 home games in a row against Stoke City. Arsenal have gone six games without a clean sheet in the Premier League. Only West Ham (14) have scored more headed goals than Arsenal (7), but only Burnley (11) have conceded more headed goals than the Gunners (9). No team has conceded more goals from set-pieces in the Barclays Premier League this season than Stoke (11, includes penalties). The Potters scored three goals from just four shots on target when they beat the Gunners 3-2 in early December.","Aaron Ramsey, Mesut Ozil and Olivier Giroud available for Arsenal .

"Four of the Premier League's leading teams - Chelsea, Manchester City, Arsenal and Liverpool - will come up against sides they historically struggle against this weekend. In a mirror of games that were played one month ago, Chelsea face Newcastle, the first side to beat them this season, while joint leaders Manchester City travel to Goodison Park where they have lost 10 of 17 meetings. And, Arsenal can expect another battling encounter against Stoke who have beaten them in their last two meetings - with Liverpool hoping there's no reappearance of the beach ball that assisted Darren Bent against Sunderland in 2009. Chelsea are one of four teams to come up against their bogey sides in the Premier League this weekend . CHELSEA vs NEWCASTLE . AS mentioned, Newcastle were the first side to beat Jose Mourinho’s Chelsea this season and have won four of the last six meetings between the two sides. Unfortunately for them they will be missing their main man. Papiss Cisse  has scored four against Chelsea, his best haul against any Premier League team, but the Senegal striker is at the Africa Cup of Nations. Key Man: In Cisse’s absence, goal-scoring responsibilities will fall on Ayoze Perez. The summer signing is the club’s second-top scorer this season with five in 19 PL appearances.

With Cisse away at the Africa Cup of Nations, Ayoze Perez (left) will carry the Magpies' goal threat . SUNDERLAND vs LIVERPOOL . Since Darren Bent’s beachball-assisted goal in 2009, Sunderland have given Liverpool some tough tests. They have held them to three draws at Anfield, including last month’s 0-0, and have worried Liverpool’s defence, even in defeat. Key Man: Costel Pantilimon could be important for Gus Poyet’s side. His saves to shots rate of 78 per cent is the best of any keeper this season. Liverpool have been held to three draws since Darren Bent scored his beach-ball assisted goal in 2009 . Sunderland No 1 Costel Pantilimon has a better saves to shots ration than any other keeper in the league . EVERTON vs MANCHESTER CITY . City might have won the last three games between the teams but they still don’t like travelling to Goodison Park. Despite a 3-2 away win last season, City have lost 10 of their 17 Premier League games at Everton, drawing four and winning just three. Key Man: Romelu Lukaku. The powerful forward had a good game against West Ham and will hope to improve Everton’s hit rate. They not scored in four of their last six games. Manchester City's previous league game against Everton saw Sergio Aguero sidelined with a knee injury . Romelu Lukaku (right) celebrates scoring against City in a narrow 3-2 defeat last season . ARSENAL vs STOKE . Arsenal never have an easy time of it against Stoke. Mark Hughes’ side have won the past two games, including a 3-2 thriller last month, and have only lost three of their last eight against Arsenal. The good news for Arsenal is they have not lost at home to Stoke in the Premier League. Key Man: Peter Crouch has scored eight against Arsenal, his joint-highest total against any club (the other being Blackburn).

"Wojciech Szczesny is fighting to save his Arsenal career with Arsene Wenger actively seeking a new No 1. Szczesny infuriated his manager on New Year's Day by smoking a cigarette in the showers after the 2-0 defeat by Southampton at St Mary's. The Pole will be fined heavily by the club for this serious breach of discipline, but it is the goalkeeper's performances on the pitch that are causing Wenger greater concerns.

To say he was already on Wenger's bad side is an understatement. He was, arguably, at fault for both Southampton goals. So, what possessed the goalkeeper to smoke in the dressing room after such an inept performance? There's a time and a place. This wasn't it, particularly given Wenger's disdain for smoking. This is not, however, the first time Szczesny has irked Arsenal's management team with his attitude. Cast your minds back to 8.22pm on February 19 last year. Szczesny had just been sent off in the Champions League last-16 first-leg clash against Bayern Munich, leaving his team-mates to play the remaining 53 minutes with 10 men against the reigning European champions. You'd have thought Szczesny would show some degree of regret to his colleagues that night. Ask those behind the scenes at the Emirates Stadium that evening and you'll hear a very different story — one that still rankles with certain members of the first-team group. Perhaps Szczesny finds it difficult to accept when he's had a bad day at the office. Smoking is a sure-fire way of leaving your troubles behind. Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger is losing patience with Polish goalkeeper Szczesny . Szczesny's team-mates were said to be unhappy at the Polish goalkeeper's seflie at White Hart Lane . Those who know Szczesny will tell you he has an unshakable belief that he is destined to become one the best goalkeepers in the world. Some would call it self-confidence. Others would call it cockiness and arrogance. Certain members of Arsenal's first-team squad would plump for the latter descriptions. His demeanour at the club's London Colney HQ often rubs his team-mates up the wrong way. Some players — even members of the backroom team — find him hard to stomach. Wenger, his staff and some senior first-teamers were not impressed when Szczesny took a selfie with Lukas Podolski and Kieran Gibbs on the White Hart Lane pitch following their victory against Tottenham in March. His attitude and professionalism is being questioned again after his latest faux-pas. No matter what they say publicly, managers will always make allowances for those who are indispensible to their plans. It seems Szczesny has used up his allowance. Arsenal scouts have been instructed to identify goalkeeping targets ahead of the summer transfer window, a clear sign that Wenger has run out of patience with the Poland international. It now looks certain that a new shot-stopper — in addition to Southampton midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin — will be a summer priority for Wenger. Petr Cech would certainly be on Wenger's radar, so too would Hugo Lloris. Whether Chelsea or Spurs would entertain selling to their local rivals is another matter. Wenger would be keen on signing Petr Cech or Hugo Lloris if Chelsea and Tottenham were prepared to sell . Morgan Schneiderlin is also likely to be on Wenger's summer transfer wishlist . Szczesny may still be able to turn it around — he's done it before. Having lost his place to Lukasz Fabianski towards the end of the 2012-13 season, Szczesny eventually reclaimed his position as the club's first-choice keeper. And he looked the part for large parts of last season, justifying Wenger's decision not to sign the new No 1 that looked a certainty in the summer of 2013. But those lapses of concentration that have dogged Szczesny's career are re-surfacing. David Ospina replaced Szczesny in last Sunday's 2-0 FA Cup third round win over Hull City, and Wenger now has a big decision to make ahead of Sunday's visit of Stoke. Does he stick with Ospina or twist with Szczesny? Wenger's decision will provide a huge clue as to whether Szczesny's Arsenal career has gone up in smoke. Meanwhile, Arsenal are confident they can complete the signing of Szczesny's countryman Krystian Bielik this month. The Gunners are hot on the heels of the talented 17-year-old midfielder and expect a deal to be completed, despite having an initial offer rejected. David Ospina started Arsenal's FA Cup victory against Hull City on Sunday .","Wojciech Szczesny will receive a heavy fine for smoking in showers .
