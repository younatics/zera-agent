"By . William Turvill . The stepdaughter of a puppy breeder accused of shooting dead her mother, sister and four dogs on his farm shouted, ‘Why, why? I love you,’ as he appeared in court for the first time today. John Lowe, 82, appeared confused as he stood in the dock and was accused of murdering the two women last Sunday at his farm in the village of Tilford near Farnham, Surrey. The outburst was made by his stepdaughter, Stacy Banner, 38, who had travelled to the court to see him appear before magistrates. Stacy Banner (left), the stepdaughter of puppy breeder John Lowe (right), 82, who is accused of shooting dead her mother, sister and four dogs, shouted, 'Why, why? I love you,' as he appeared in court today . The bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home . Lowe was helped into the dock at Guildford Magistrates' Court by security guards to face the double murder allegations. He was accused of killing Christine Lee, 66, and her 40-year-old daughter, Lucy. Their bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home. Lowe was also accused of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life. During a brief and emotionally-charged, hearing, Lowe spoke to confirm his details. He struggled to hear what was being said, telling the court: ‘I'm a little bit deaf.’ Wearing a navy blue jumper and dark trousers, the white-haired defendant appeared confused.Mrs Banner shouted: ‘Why, why? I love you.’ During a brief and emotionally-charged, hearing, Lowe spoke to confirm his details. He struggled to hear what was being said, telling the court: 'I'm a little bit deaf' Scene: Police called to a house outside Farnham, Surrey, found the bodies of two women and four dogs . The clerk said to magistrates: ‘I will ask you to send him to the Crown Court. ‘This court is unable to make a determination in relation to bail because you don't have jurisdiction.’ Richard Sawle, presiding magistrate, told the defendant: ‘We are sending you to the crown court today where you will appear before Judge Critchlow.’ Lowe was then led back to the cells before making the 50 yard journey to the higher court. Following the discovery, Mrs Banner said her whole family had been ‘wiped out’ as detectives questioned Lowe about the bloodshed. Her mother was found dead inside the dilapidated farmhouse, while her sister, Lucy, had been shot dead outside in a muddy yard. Both the dead women had been shot with a long-barrelled shotgun and were pronounced dead at the scene. Surrey Police confirmed the identities of Christine and Lucy Lee and said post-mortem examinations showed they died from gunshot wounds. 'I have lost everyone - my mum, sister…. This is a nightmare,' Mrs Banner told The Sun’s James Beal. 'I just can't get my head around what's happened. My family's gone and I'm absolutely devastated. 'I'm utterly heartbroken - we've been left in pieces. 'I just want to wake up and be told it's a dream. My mum and sister must have been so scared.' A marked police van guarded the gates at the end of the drive of the detached house when they were called . A few yards away from the bodies, in a . filthy kennel, police found a German shepherd that had been shot dead, . while two other German shepherds and a labrador were also found dead . nearby.Lowe was arrested at the scene on suspicion of murder. Detective Chief Inspector Mark Preston said the suspect was uninjured and remained calm when officers attended the house. Detectives . from Surrey Police are investigating whether one of the guns recovered . at the scene was one they returned to Lowe last summer. Surrey Police . had had previous contact with parties involved in this incident and has . referred a past contact to the IPCC, a spokesman said. 'In May 2013 a . shotgun licence and a number of licensed shotguns were seized from the . address however the licence and guns were returned in July 2013. 'We are in the process of establishing if one of these licensed guns was the firearm recovered on Sunday'. An . IPCC spokesman told MailOnline: 'We have received a referral from . Surrey Police and are considering what our involvement should be.' The women's bodies bodies were discovered by police responding to reports of gunfire at his isolated home . Animal welfare officers were called to rescue animals living in at the property, Keeper’s Cottage Stud, after Sunday’s shooting. In . all, 14 dogs were taken away, including nine kept in filthy, crumbling, . outdoor pens. Six horses were also found at the property where Mr Lowe . lived alone following his partner’s death last year. Two in extremely poor condition were rescued from a yard covered in pools of liquid manure and strewn with rotting hay. The other four emaciated animals remained in a stable with its roof hanging off. They were caked in mud. Among scrap metal and tumble-down outbuildings, a dovecote could be seen where Lowe is said to have kept birds. It emerged that officials had regularly visited Keeper’s Cottage Stud over concerns at the conditions in which animals lived. Lowe was also accused of possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life . Surrey Police and the RSPCA were called in last July over concerns about breeding at the farm, when 50 dogs were found. RSPCA . inspector Rob Jackson said last night: ‘I came to Mr Lowe’s property . about six months ago responding to a complaint about the welfare of dogs . at the farm. ‘I will not discuss that visit but previously he has . bred a number of different breeds – beagles, labradoodles and German . shepherds.’ An online petition set up last year calling on the RSPCA to close the puppy farm attracted 1,300 signatures. Lowe . denied wrongdoing at the time, saying: ‘There are no puppies here. The . only dogs here are my four guard dogs. I have never heard of this . petition and the things said on it are absolute rubbish.’ Neighbours . described the suspect as a recluse. ‘The RSPCA was always up there and . no sooner had they shut him down than he would spring back into . business. They just couldn’t stop him,’ said one man, who declined to be . named.

"By . Deni Kirkova for MailOnline . A woman who spoils her four dogs with homemade biscuits, treats and cakes, has set up an artisan bakery just for them. Rebecca Hughes, from Liverpool, Merseyside, had the barking mad idea for Doggy Love Bakery after getting stuck into canine cookery books. Her pets, who at her own admittance are like children to Becky and her husband Neil, get to go on holiday, celebrate their birthdays - and all four even sleep in the couple's bed with them each night. Keen cook Rebecca Hughes decided to start the Doggy Love Bakery, especially for dogs . Now the four pampered pooches are the first to taste-test Becky's new creations from her bakery. Becky said: 'At Christmas we buy them presents and I bake them special treats and every year I take their birthday off work to take them on a big day out and buy them a nice dinner. 'All four of them sleep in our bed every night with us and we had to get a super king size bed to accommodate them. 'I also have a tattoo in honour of my dogs, which later became my dog bakery logo. 'Neil and I aren't really interested in having children and so our dogs are like children to us. We adore them.' She's been getting stuck into doggy cookery books and spoiling her dogs with homemade treats and cakes . Becky got her first dog, Meg, in 2006 from the RSPCA, followed by Alfie and Roxi. She added Dolly to the family just a couple of months ago. The couple celebrate all their dog's birthdays every year on July 16, when Becky takes the day off work to spend a special day with the lucky pooches. She said: 'Two of our dogs were born in July a year apart - but we don't know the specific dates so we just randomly picked the 16th and decided they would both celebrate it on the same day. 'When we got our third dog, Roxi, she was officially born in December but we didn't want to leave her out so we just celebrated her birthday on the same day as the other two. 'Dolly was rescued from Romania. We got her from Love Underdogs, a charity that give Romanian street dogs a second chance at a happy life. When we got her passport her birthday was July 15, purely by chance.' Becky set up her dog bakery in December 2012 after a work colleague bought her some doggy cookery books as a gift a few years earlier. She said: 'It became tradition that every Christmas Eve I would bake treats for my dogs. 'I started to tweak the recipes to suit their favourite foods, then later started getting creative and coming up with my own recipes and ideas. 'Now I sell my treats via my website and on my stall, which I have at various dog shows around the country at weekends throughout spring and summer.' Becky comes up with unique flavour ideas based on human favourites, such as minted lamb, gammon and pineapple and peanut butter cookies. She has even started coming up with treats based on cuisines from around the world including pepperoni pizza for Italy, hot dogs for America and kangaroo flavour representing Australia. Dog-friendly chocolate birthday cakes with personalised messages are available, and she is working on doggy doughnuts and a possible dog beverage. Rebecca's dogs helping themselves to doggy biscuits and treats off the table . The four pampered pooches are the first to taste-test Becky's new creations from her bakery . Becky said: 'We love to travel and see the world, so we buy the dogs themed toys from the places we visit. This led to me baking treats inspired by countries around the world for them too. We hope to take the dogs abroad on holiday next year so they can travel with us. 'I have some great customers that come to my shows and stock up on treats for their lovely dogs. 'Through my business I support a number of dog and animal charities through monthly donations and when I sell treats at dog shows organised in aid of charities, I donate treats to the homeless dogs currently in the care of the charity. 'At Christmas, we donate food to the RSPCA, where Meg and Roxi are from, and I give out free treats to dogs owned by homeless people living on the streets.' In September this year Becky is starting an evening class to learn dog grooming so she can expand her business.

"By . Darren Boyle for MailOnline . A paramedic who claimed to be gay, raped one woman while a student and sexually assaulted two others, has been jailed for 12 years. Christopher Bridger, 25, from Stevenage, Hertfordshire raped his first victim while a student paramedic in London in September 2008. He later assaulted two of his colleagues at the South East Coast Ambulance service after pretending he was gay and befriending the women. Christopher Bridger, pictured, pretended to be gay in order to befriend woman before attacking them . Bridger was found guilty of one count of rape and four others of sexual abuse following a 12-day trial at Guildford Crown Court in Surrey. The seven men and four women took four hours to return a guilty verdict, however he was acquitted of two further charges of sex assault by penetration and a sex assault on two other women who he knew. All three victims, who cannot be named for legal reasons, are in their 20s. They were forced to give evidence during the trial, during which Bridger accused each of them of lying. The first victim said she had been raped after a fancy dress party during Freshers' Week party at George's University Hospital in September 2008. The woman said Bridger had told her he was gay and accompanied her back to her halls of residence after the party when they started to kiss and cuddle. The woman said she told Bridger to stop, who ignored her wishes and raped her. The court heard that Bridger broke down in tears following the attack and admitted: 'I just want to like girls.' The girl said she had even comforted Bridger even though she knew what he had done was wrong. Later, Bridger started working for the South East Coast Ambulance Service NHS Trust in 2010. Guildford Crown Court heard that his second victim was assaulted as she lay in bed with her lesbian lover after the work Christmas party in December 2011. The court heard that he woman had got extremely intoxicated and had a row with her girlfriend on the night of the attack. Bridger accused each of his three victims of lying during his 12-day trial before Guildford Crown Court . Bridger's collegue told the jury how Bridger came up to her hotel room after she got extremely intoxicated at the party. She had been arguing with her girlfriend, who started recording her drunken rant on her mobile phone. Audio of that recording was played to the jury, during which Bridger is heard to come into the room and ask the woman for a hug and a kiss, which she obliged to, thinking he was gay. Afterwards, Bridger climbed into bed between his victim and her partner, she said. The woman awoke to find him sexually assaulting her and pleasuring himself as her girlfriend lay asleep next to them. She kept quiet, fearing her partner wouldn't understand what had happened. The day after was Bridger's birthday and he sheepishly sent the woman a number of text messages apologising for his behaviour. One text said: 'It was one night of stupidity for which I will be eternally sorry.' Another said: 'You don't have to forgive me, I'm just telling you the truth. I'm ashamed of myself.' His final victim was also a colleague from the South East Coast Ambulance Service, who said she was sexually assaulted after she allowed him to stay the night at her house after a dinner in October 2012. The court heard all the women had been told by Bridger - and believed him - that he was openly gay. Bridger was suspended from work after the incidents were reported to South East Coast Ambulance Service management in late 2012. Despite being told not to contact any of the alleged victims, he left a voicemail message with the final complainant on Christmas morning in 2012, in which he was 'full of self-pity.' Following an internal NHS inquiry, Surrey Police arrested Bridger in January 2013 and he denied any involvement, telling detectives that he was a gay man who had been in several same sex relationships. He had been separately arrested by the Metropolitan Police and questioned in relation to the allegations while he was a student paramedic. Bridger did admit having sex with his rape victim but claimed that it was consensual and an experience 'that confirmed I am gay.' He claimed the other incidents had just been 'drunken fumbles' and that the women were lying. Court Recorder Mark Milliken-Smith handed down a 12 year sentence earlier today. Mr Milliken-Smith said: 'These were wicked, mean and utterly cowardly offences which have and will have serious consequences on these young women and those around them for a very long time. 'In each case the young woman in question believed you were gay. You told everyone you were gay. They never contemplated you presented a danger to them. 'They trusted you in situations they would not have allowed heterosexual men. 'You took advantage of that belief.' Mr Milliken-Smith criticised Bridger for putting his victims through the trauma of a trial. He said: 'Each of your victims has suffered great and prolonged trauma by virtue of what you have done. 'That trauma has been exacerbated quite considerably by having to relive those events at trial.' Guildford Crown Court, pictured, heard Bridger added to the women's trauma by forcing them to testify . Describing impact statements written by Bridger's victims, prosecutor Caroline Carberry said: 'The overwhelming feeling of the victims in this case are those of disbelief, self-doubt, guilt, shame and a very real sense of betrayal by someone they trusted. 'The destructive effect of this defendant's actions is very clear from the statements provided.' Brian Aldred defending, said Bridger was 'shocked and upset at the pain and distress his actions have caused for those victims'. Mr Aldred added: 'No human being is wholly evil. 'We all have our good sides and our bad sides. 'Today Christopher Bridger's bad sides are going to be there for everybody to see and he is going to be punished for them.' Bridger was jailed for eight years for rape and four years for sexual assault by penetration, to run consecutively. He was jailed for 12 months for one of the sexual assaults and six months for the other and sentenced to 18 months in prison for the inciting charge, all to run concurrently with the rape and penetration charges. The judge also told him he would spend three years on prison licence after the end of his custody spell. Bridger nodded to family members as he was led from the dock.","Christopher Bridger pretended to be gay to befriend women at work .

"By . Nelson Groom For Daily Mail Australia . While you were snoring in the middle of the night, Cameron Harder-Hutton was busy making history: he was single-handedly representing Australia in a world-wide video-call to Pope Francis. The 17-year-old St. Joseph's Nudgee College student was selected by Catholic Education Australia from hundreds of students nominated for the role. The call, which happened at 1 am Eastern Standard Time this morning, was an initiative to connect youths from every continent with the Bishop of Rome. Cameron joined six others in the dialogue, which was hosted on the website Google hangouts. Cameron told Daily Mail Australia the plan came out of the blue for him. ‘I only found out last week. I was chosen without really nominating myself; my school just told me ‘you’re going to speak with the Pope.’ 17-year-old Cameron Hardy-Hutton (above) was chosen from hundreds of other candidates to represent Australia in the seven-continent-wide video call with Pope Francis . Close company: Cameron was joined for the call by some of his St. Joseph's Nudgee College peers . ‘At first I was like ‘are you sure?’ I was sceptical that it was legitimate. It was quite surreal, really.’ Cameron explained he was allowed to invite 20 guests. ‘I chose my mum and some close friends, the ones who were interested in social justice and would appreciate the invite.' The year-12-student represented Australia by kicking things off with a true-blue greeting: ‘I introduced myself with a hearty g’day. After that, I was allowed to ask him one question of my choosing. I chose to ask him about the how getting young people from around the world into dialogue with each other, which is something my school is involved in, could make a difference to the world.' Surreal: Cameron said he was sceptical if it was really going to happen when he  first heard about the call . Cameron said Pope Francis is more in tune with his generation than his forerunners, which is important since they are the future of the church . ‘I was pretty nervous beforehand, though it helped that we did some rehearsals. I had to memorise everything to say to him without looking down.’ ‘He was in Italy for the call. He actually spoke in Spanish and had a translator, but you could tell he was very passionate in his mannerisms, which was really humbling.’ ‘Pope Francis is  in tune with my generation, which is excellent, because that’s where the future of the church lies. He’s asking followers of the church where they think the church is heading, rather than just telling them.’ Opportunist: Cameron capitalised on a chance to capture the moment by snapping a Pope-selfie . Cameron explained how he Pope Francis differs from his forerunners. ‘I think Pope Francis has distinguished himself through his forward thinking views on controversial issues like homosexuality and abortion.’ Lastly, Cameron explained how he capitalised on a memorable opportunity: ‘Pope Francis posed for a selfie last year in South Korea.  I decided to help myself to my own Pope-selfie. It had to be done.’","Cameron Hardy-Hutton was selected from hundreds of Australian nominees .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . Amie Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to her Staffordshire Bull Terrier at Newcastle Magistrates' court yesterday . A cruel owner is facing jail after starving her Staffordshire bull terrier to death and locking it in a filthy kitchen filled with rubbish and faeces. Amie Smith, 23, pleaded guilty to causing unnecessary suffering to an animal after the emaciated body of her white terrier, Rocky, was discovered by police in her Tyneside home. The starving animal had become so desperate for food that he chewed tins of dog food which had been left on the floor, Newcastle Magistrates' court heard yesterday. When his body was examined by a vet, Rocky was found to weigh just 11kg, when he should have been more than 18kg. Police entered Smith's home in Walker, after a worker from Your Homes Newcastle, reported 'a smell of death'. Prosecutor Denise Jackman said: 'The officer found a deceased, white Staffordshire bull terrier lying on the kitchen floor among a vast amount of rubbish. The body of the dog was emaciated and had ribs protruding. 'There were faeces all over the floor. There was an empty water bowl and tins of food with dints in, as if the dog had attempted to open the tin with his teeth. 'The RSPCA inspector said there was an over-powering smell and that the kitchen was extremely cluttered. 'She noticed the tins of dog meat, which had been chewed. 'The vet said the unnecessary suffering of starvation would have caused immense stress. The hunger would have caused loss of consciousness before death occurred.' When interviewed, Smith, who now lives in Wallsend, said she asked a friend to look after the dog while she went away to Blackpool between February 5 and March 26 this year. David Parish, speaking in her defence, said Smith suffers from mental health issues and was ashamed of her actions. WARNING GRAPHIC CONTENT . Scroll down for video .

The kitten was found injured by a passer-by after getting trapped in a garden and taken to a rescue centre . She was later transferred to an animal hospital in London where vets had no option but amputate her right front leg. Despite her handicap, vets said she has made a remarkable recovery and will make an adorable pet for one family. Babybell, who was named after the popular cheese by volunteers at the Blue Cross pet charity where she is recovering, is now five weeks old and is expected to be re-homed next month. Volunteer Sally Blackman said: 'She is so young and was probably just naive and hungry so went to the mousetrap for food. 'She probably doesn't know anything different than having three legs. She is very resilient. 'She is able to climb up on top of one of the scratching posts with just her three legs. She walks down the corridor and says hello to the other cats and kittens too. 'She is absolutely adorable. She will make a lovely pet.' Blue Cross volunteer Sally Blackman said it was likely Babybell was looking for food when she got caught in the mousetrap. The kitten is now five weeks old and is on the road to recovery ahead of her re-homing next month . The kitten faced an agonising death after getting caught in the trap but was fortunately rescued by a passer-by . Cristina Bull, a veterinary surgeon at the charity, said the trap had caused irreversible neurological damage which, along with an infection to the wound, had prompted the amputation. She said: 'Babybell was very lucky she was found otherwise she wouldn't have survived much longer.' Lisa Kent, the charity's animal welfare assistant, added: 'Babybell is so young that she will adjust well to life with three legs. Vets believe the young kitten will adjust to life with three legs and will make an adorable pet for a new family . The trap caused irreversible neurological damage and an infection which prompted vets  to amputate the paw . 'She's already amazed us all with how well she's doing after her operation. 'She's very sweet and hopefully her disability won't put people off giving her a home.' Blue Cross has cared for over 40,000 sick, injured and homeless pets every year since it opened the world's first animal hospital in 1906.","Kitten got paw caught in trap while looking for food in Oxfordshire garden .

"By . Steph Cockroft for MailOnline . Pregnant Josie Cunningham stepped out today with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump - before announcing she would be setting up a trust fund to pay for her unborn daughter's boob job. The wannabe glamour model, who rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS, was distraught when she found out she was having a boy, due in October. But the 24-year-old revealed this week that she was actually pregnant with a baby girl - and promptly celebrated by painting the 90s-inspired motif over her belly. Scroll down for video . Wannabe glamour model Josie Cunningham, 24, stepped out today with a Girl Power painting sprawled over her bump, days after announcing she would be giving birth to a girl and not a boy . She then went one step further - by vowing to her fans that the £4,800 cost of her controversial surgery would be put into a trust for her baby's boob job, once she turns 18. Josie had previously suggested she would reimburse the NHS for the cost of her controversial breast enhancement surgery. But, using the hashtag #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1, Josie said she made the decision because '80% of the country are against' her. Josie Cunningham tweeted earlier today that she would put £4,800 into a trust fund for her unborn daughter's boob job which she could have once she reached 18 . She tweeted: 'Getting bored of people being horrible at every opportunity. When I discovered I was having a girl & cancelling the tickets (cont)- I made sure I had a way of getting the £4,800 back to the NHS for my boob job, because I knew people would bang on about that forever. 'HOWEVER, considering 80% of the country are against me, i'll have the £4800 put in a trust fund for my little girl when she's 18 so she can have a boob job. Job done! #BritishPublic0JosieCunningham1' The announcement is the latest episode in what has been an ongoing drama since Josie revealed she was pregnant. After she found out she was having a boy, Josie decided to sell tickets to the live birth of her child. Four tickets to the home birth had sold out in just 14 minutes - netting her £30,000. The wannabe glamour model rose to fame after undergoing a £4,800 breast enlargement on the NHS . It is thought that three of the four tickets were purchased by journalists while the fourth is believed to have been bought by somebody described as 'a super-fan'. She later said that 50 fans would be able to log on to the video chat service Skype and watch the former prostitute's delivery via videolink. But, this week, despite saying some of the money would go back to the NHS, she had a change of heart. She said: 'I want to enjoy my precious first few moments alone with my daughter and my mum - not share them with the world. 'I've really started looking after myself. I have never purposely put my child at any risk, but when I was originally told I was having a boy I just lost all willpower to avoid cravings. 'I've now cut down to just one or two fags a day. I'm about to get hypnotherapy to stop completely.' After finding out she was having a boy, she admitted she smoked a whole packet of cigarettes and drank one glass of wine after the other because she felt 'genuinely gutted'. Doctors had originally told Josie, from Leeds that she was expecting a third boy but she asked for a second opinion after using a home scan kit which said she was expecting a girl. Josie became a household name when she admitted undergoing £4,800 worth of breast enhancement surgery paid by the NHS to increase her bust from a 32A to 36DD. She claimed she needed the surgery because she had been bullied since the age of 14 for being flat chested. Later it also emerged that she received Botox on the NHS over a 'sweat problem'. Josie's most controversial outburst came when she publicly considered aborting the child because the pregnancy prevented her from appearing on Channel 5's Big Brother. The mother-of-two later said she was receiving negative attention on public transport and asked the council to provide her with a £6,000-a-year taxi to take her children to school. She originally announced she was selling tickets to her labour so she could repay the NHS for the surgery - but has since said she is putting the money in a trust fund for her yet-to-be-born daughter's boob job . Earlier this month she made headlines again when she said now wanted a nose job - funded by the public. She set up a website called fundmynose.co.uk to encourage people to donate towards the £3,000 cosmetic operation. She claimed she was fed up of people comparing her to The Muppets’ Miss Piggy and now wants a brand new nose which is a ‘cross between Michelle Keegan and Jennifer Aniston’. It comes after the former escort, who previously worked a stint as a £1,000-a-night prostitute, told female students 'not to worry' if their exam results were not quite what they were hoping for. As A-level exam results this month, she tweeted: 'Good luck to everyone getting your A-level results today. Girls don't worry if ur results are poor - you can always (cont). 'have a career getting your t***s out or escorting. (Obviously if your over 18!). #Josie'sCareerAdvice.","Pregnant 24-year-old stepped out with 'Girl Power' art sprawled over bump .

"By . Jenny Awford for MailOnline . The luxury property tycoon behind Britain’s most expensive development is about to move into London’s largest private residence, second only to Buckingham Palace. Christian Candy is listed on Land Registry documents as the purchaser of a row of seven grade I listed buildings that have planning permission to be transformed into a mansion in Regent’s Park. After years of selling multi-million pound flats and homes to some of the wealthiest people in the world, the purchase will set the 39-year-old businessman back almost £100million. Scroll down for video . The seven Regency houses on Chester Gate and Cambridge Terrace (shown) in Regent's Park, north London, will set Christian Candy back around £100million . Marcus Cooper Group put up the 50,000 sq ft Regency terrace up for sale in June after winning permission to convert the row of seven office buildings into a vast 15-bedroom stuccoed mansion. It will have 35 bathrooms alone and could  be worth £200m once converted. On the top floor of the seven-storey house there will be a lush private roof garden, completely invisible from street level. It will feature a giant sliding glass roof to allow sunbathing in hot weather, and keep out the rain during the rest of the year. This aerial shot shows the seven properties which will be converted into a palatial home by Candy . The resulting home - which includes numbers six to 10 Cambridge Terrace (pictured) will be more akin to a palace, and indeed will claim the title of London's largest residence after Buckingham Palace . Holly Valance, Nick Candy (left) and Christian Candy (right) with his partner Emily Candy at One Hyde Park . The seven Regency houses, including numbers one and two Chester Gate and numbers six to 10 Cambridge Terrace were designed by John Nash - the architect of Buckingham Palace. They were constructed in 1826 but were damaged by bombs in WWII and a subsequent fire in 1947, before being restored with replica Nash facades in the 1980s. The sale represents one of the most expensive in the world, joining a small collection of trophy homes that have commanded nine figure price tags, including a handful in London. Knight Frank is believed to be advising Marcus Cooper Group. All parties declined to comment. Mr Candy and his brother Nick are behind luxury housing scheme, One Hyde Park, in Knightsbridge. They worked with the prime minister of Qatar to deliver the major retail and residential complex, estimated to have cost £1.15billion. The central London development is home to  Britain's most expensive ever flat after a wealthy Eastern European reportedly bought it for £140million.

"By . Alex Finnis for MailOnline . Too cool for school: Victor Micula was kicked out of his exam after being caught cheating . The teenage son of a £160million tycoon learned the hard way that money can't buy everything - when he was booted out of his high school final exams for cheating. Victor Micula, 18, who used to arrive at school by helicopter so he could sleep in longer in the mornings, turned up for the exam resit in a black £160,000 Ferrari, boasting to local reporters in Oradea, western Romania, that he was 'confident and well prepared'. The Ferrari was then driven off by a minder, but just an hour later a scowling Victor emerged - and he dashed into a waiting Mercedes S class limo, refusing to say a word. The reason for his fury emerged days later when the results of the test posted on the school noticeboard revealed he had been removed from the exam for cheating. One schoolmate said: 'This was his last chance to graduate because he'd already failed the exam once. 'It just shows you money can't buy everything - but I don't think it's going to affect his career prospects as he can always get a job from his dad.' Under Romanian education ministry rules, a dismissal for cheating means the boy will not be allowed to take the final exam again before 2016. The  teen stands to inherit a fortune from his father Ioan Micula, who built his business empire in tourism, property, the media and industry. Victor's antics are a regular feature in the Romanian media. So flash: Victor turned up for the exam in a £160,000 black Ferrari, but left in a huff an hour later . Victor's antics are often reported on in the Romanian media - and often involve his driving . He was rapped when he drove his Ferrari down a pedestrian-only street to go shopping at a jewellery shop with his girlfriend, and was banned from driving for three months when he was caught speeding. Earlier this year, he told reporters he wanted to go to a Romanian monastery to pray and find peace from exam pressure - but angered those meditating at the building by turning up in his private helicopter. Victor's older sister Olivia, who studied at Regent's Business School, got married earlier this month The bride and groom released around 500 white doves during the ceremony, while at the reception guests sat around a two metre high wedding cake.

"By . Victoria Woollaston for MailOnline . You could be forgiven for thinking these images are futuristic designs for a science fiction film, or creatures from the deep - but they are in fact plumes of smoke. A German photographer captured the swirling, intricate movements of cigarette smoke as it travelled through the air in his studio in Dusseldorf. Some of his images look like sea creatures, one resembles a foetus, while another looks like a trumpet. Dusseldorf-based Thomas Herbrich attached a burning cigarette to a tripod in front of a black background. He set up a high-speed flash and fired shots at 1/10,000 frames a second. This made it possible to capture the shapes made by the smoke as it travelled into the air, such as this shot that resembles a sea creature . To achieve the effect, Mr Herbrich attached a burning cigarette to a tripod in front of a black background in his studio in Dusseldorf.

This made it possible to capture the shapes made by the smoke as it travelled into the air. ‘I have always been fascinated by cigarette smoke’, Mr Herbrich said. ‘You watch it rising and making the most superb shapes. I was very surprised by how extremely quickly smoke moves. It’s easier to photograph a racing car. ‘The rising of smoke is actually so quick that conventional flash equipment is too slow, as is the photographer. The left-hand image looks similar to a foetus, while the right-hand shot resembles a spine. During the process, Mr Herbrich had to keep ventilating the room due to the build-up of smoke.He also had to clear the air so only the individual smoke trails were visible, and not hidden in a cloud of smog .

Or the scene was too busy. Swirling cylinders of the smoke are pictured. Of the thousands of images, Mr Herbrich selected the best 20 for his Smoke exhibition at an art fair in Cologne . Many of the images took on almost human form, such as the left-hand image that looks like a face in profile or a brain scan.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . The number of ways Australians can die down under . Australians living in fear of spiders, snakes or man-eating sea monsters can now add bees, jellyfish, cats, camels and just about every animal under the sun to their list of do-not-encounter creatures. While many Australians and overseas tourists regard those deadly animals swimming in our seas and rivers the most dangerous, statistics reveal a much different side to the story. A decade-long breakdown of 254 animal-related deaths by the National Coronial Information System reveal more people died down under from horses and cows than any other animal. The statistics have been used to promote a new Australian parody of the US film to be released on DVD this week  'A Million Ways To Die In The West.' The Australian take on the Seth MacFarlane film is called 'A Million ways To Die in Australia's West,' and it delves into the more insane ways people have died down under - such as tripping over cats or being mauled by the animals on our national emblem. Sydney Wildlife expert David Whitehill said while many of the ways people have died on the list are true, there is also a number of long-held myths such as dying by drop attacks that tourists still believe happens. 'A lot of it is tongue and cheek,' he said. 'But it's quite interesting to hear people's perception of different Australian animals and to hear how people have died.' Horses kill more people in Australia by trampling on them or people falling off than any other animal related death . Crocodiles and snakes are less likely to kill you than horses or  jelly fish . A computer generated image of what a drop bear might look like if it existed . He said the most dangerous animals he still hears about are spiders and sharks, 'but the animal that has been the most dangerous and caused the most deaths is the horse,' he said. Seventy-seven of the 254-related deaths have been attributed to horses, donkeys or ponies according to the NCIS, and one person died by tripping on a cat. The actual cause of the horse-related fatalities vary but falling or being trampled account for the vast majority. Horses along with cows, bulls, kangaroos, ostriches, emus and bovine animals were also responsible for a good number of motor vehicle accident fatalities between them. Others, including fish, sheep, goats, camels, cats and jellyfish have accounted for 39 deaths - 26 more than sharks and 32 more than crocodiles. Queensland is our most dangerous state for animal deaths followed buy NSW and Victoria. Queensland is Australia's most dangerous state when it comes to animal-related deaths . You’re more likely to be killed by a vending machine falling on you, than being bitten by a shark - research suggests . Mr Whitehill said because of Australia's isolated place in the world travellers perceive it as this 'dangerous playground.' 'Reality is though that unless you go looking for these animals and cross their path you're unlikely to see them.' 'Definitely though if you step out of your comfort zone of the cities there are these animals out there.' He said they create 'fascinating' stories and are part of the allure for travellers visiting  Australia. 'I've had the opportunity to travel to every continent across the planet with and it is without doubt something Australians do really well.' Even drop bears got a mention in the NCIS statistics for 'killing or injuring a few tourists.' 'But surprisingly no Aussies have ever encountered one.' Mr Whitehill did say though that there is an element of truth to some of the stories that to get told about Australia's animal folklore and that people should be wary of certain situations. 'Obviously the salt water croc is a major danger and needs to be taken seriously,' he said.","Statistics reveal horses kill more Australians  than any other animal .

"By . Ted Thornhill . An OAP ended his life with a sawn-off shotgun because he found a disease that left him feeling like he was ‘drowning’ in his own bodily fluids too much to bear. Michael Durrant, 73, from mid-Wales, suffered from an extremely rare medical condition called Multiple Chemical Sensitivity (MCS), which left him housebound. Aberystwyth coroner’s court heard that MCS caused him to feel as though he was ‘drowning’ in his own body fluids if he came into any kind of contact with substances like smoke, perfume or shampoo. Hearing: A coroner's court in Aberystwyth heard that Michael Durrant killed himself after finding his rare condition, which left him feeling like he was drowning, too much to bear . He was found dead with a gunshot wound in a layby on a quiet country road earlier this year. In a heartbreaking note left to his wife, Mr Durrant, from Llechgron, near Aberystwyth, wrote: 'My life is not worth living. Clearly this decision is not one that I can take with equanimity. 'I’m heartbroken, and weeping with grief.' The inquest heard how a passing motorist, Eifion Jones, spotted a red Volkswagen Golf in the layby of the B4577 near Bethania, at around 7.45am on January 12 as he was on his way to work. Mr Durrant’s body was lying behind the car - which was owned by his wife - and there was a sawn-off shotgun on the ground nearby, prompting Mr Jones to call the police. Another witness, Vicky Sweetland, noted that Mr Durrant had 'extensive' injuries to his head. Pc Nia Owen, from Lampeter Police Station, told the inquest that she had been called out to the scene and found a packet addressed to the police and coroner, along with a USB memory stick. Multiple Chemical Sensitivity is an unusually severe sensitivity or allergy-like reaction to many different kinds of pollutants including solvents, VOC's (Volatile Organic Compounds), perfumes, petrol, diesel, smoke, 'chemicals' in general and often encompasses problems with regard to pollen, house dust mites, and pet fur. What sets an MCS patient apart from other allergy sufferers is that they react to both large and minuscule levels of irritants. Sometimes these levels are so low that others are completely unaware that there's anything potentially troublesome in the vicinity. Multiple chemical sensitivity - unlike true allergies where the underlying mechanisms of the problem are relatively well understood and widely accepted- is generally regarded as 'idiopathic' - meaning that it has no known mechanism of causation and its processes are not fully understood. Source: www.multiplechemicalsensitivity.org . She added: 'The gun was registered to Mr Durrant. 'The scene was examined and at approximately 8.53am armed response officers attended his home address. 'Mrs Durrant was asleep in bed and was unaware that he had left at all. There was a letter left in the house, identical to the one found in the car, as well as a letter to Mrs Durrant. 'The letter was about his illnesses. Christine Durrant explained about the circumstances leading up to his disappearance and said he was behaving normally the day before, although he was agitated and was downloading things from his computer. 'He had intended to walk around the block and Mrs Durrant requested that she go with him, but he declined.' Recording a verdict of suicide, Ceredigion coroner Peter Brunton said: 'How he had borne these difficulties for so long is very difficult to comprehend, and it’s remarkable that he carried on for so long.' Addressing Mrs Durrant, he added: 'I can only marvel at the fortitude with which you both bore these difficulties for so long.'","Michael Durrant, from Wales, suffered from Multiple Chemical Sensitivity .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Staff at South Lakes Wild Animal Park have been banned from climbing ladders to put food on poles . Zoo keepers have been banned from climbing ladders when putting food for their tigers on top of 20ft poles. Putting the food on the poles allows the rare cats to climb and follow their hunting instincts, as well as entertaining thousands of visitors. But Barrow Borough Council has decreed it is too dangerous and imposed the health and safety ruling on South Lakes Safari Zoo in Dalton, Cumbria. It comes after a keeper was blown off her ladder this year in strong winds and suffered a broken collarbone. The zoo said its staff, who are estimated to have fed the tigers this way about 75,000 times in the past 18 years, now wear helmets, while the ladders are strapped to the poles. In a statement from the zoo posted on their Facebook page, it said: 'Even though the keepers now wear helmets, strap the ladders to the poles firmly and have permanent foot fixing points for the ladders, Barrow Borough Council wishes to stop us from feeding in this way as they claim it to be too dangerous for the staff.' It added that the ban would completely stop the ‘exciting’ feeding time practice and ‘our unique way of stimulating our cats’. Feeding the endangered Sumatran tigers this way was ‘a scientifically proven way’ of improving their health, fitness and welfare, the zoo said. The zoo said it had tried rope pulley systems and long poles to get the meat to the top of poles but it did not work. 'We have made every effort to find solutions that benefit the staff and the animals and yet we are still in this situation,' added the post. A Barrow Borough Council spokesperson said an improvement notice was served under section 21 of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974. 'This notice was served because the park had failed to make a suitable and sufficient assessment of the risks to the health and safety of its employees to prevent a person falling a distance liable to cause personal injury whilst undertaking the routine placement of food at height for big cat carnivores,' added the spokesperson.

"By . Tom McTague, Deputy Political Editor for MailOnline . Margaret Hodge, the Public Accounts Committee chair, said it was 'astonishing' that the Government failed to properly consult the head of the military before making deep defence spending cuts . Ministers have been accused of putting Britain's military at risk by ‘bungling’ money-saving army reforms. The respected Commons’ Public Accounts Committee said it was ‘astonishing’ that the Ministry of Defence failed to consult the head of the Army fully before pushing ahead with deep cuts to regular forces. It also failed to give proper consideration to whether it was possible for reservist numbers to be almost doubled by 2019, and it managed to squander millions of pounds through a flawed deal with Capita. The verdict, delivered in the cross-party committee's report on the controversial Army 2020 programme, comes as Nato leaders gather in Wales for a key summit. The scheme is intended to save more than £10 billion over a decade, by cutting 20,000 personnel from the regular army and increasing reservist strength to 30,000. But the National Audit Office (NAO) has suggested that the recruitment target could take six years longer than planned to hit. The committee said it ‘remained to be convinced’ that the goal could be reached on time. Chair Margaret Hodge described the handling of the project so far as ‘astonishing’. ‘The decision to reduce the size of the Army was driven by the need to make financial savings in a time of austerity,’ she said. ‘However, it is remarkable that the chief of the general staff was not involved in all stages of the decision-making process, given the magnitude and importance of the change required, and its impact on the service which he commands. ‘The MoD did not test the feasibility of recruiting and training the 30,000 reserve soldiers it needs by 2019. The strength of the Army Reserve has stayed at around 19,000 for the last two years, and we remain to be convinced that the MoD will recruit the required numbers in time. ‘The Army told us that shortfalls in recruitment are increasing the risk of capability gaps emerging in some parts of the Army's structure. This in turn increases the risk of additional pressure being placed on regular troops.’ Capita, the private firm brought in to handle recruitment, was said to have brought in just 2,000 reserves in 2013/14 against a target of 6,000. The goal for recruitment of regulars was also missed by 30 per cent, according to the committee. The company was still awarded its full bonus for recruiting reservists. ‘The MoD's bungling around the recruitment contract with Capita has meant at least £70 million of the planned £267 million savings from the contract have already been lost,’ Mrs Hodge said. ‘There was no clear understanding of the scale of the recruitment challenge, poor information about potential recruits and the MoD did not provide Capita with the IT infrastructure it needed.’ Labour MP Mrs Hodge said it was ‘wholly unacceptable’ that the Government's Plan B for the Army seemed to be ‘to get Plan A to work’. NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen,  David Cameron and US President Barack Obama - watching a military fly past  in Newport, Wales, today - have called for European countries to increase their defence spending . The committee heard that contingency plans included extending tours of duty for regular troops, which could affect morale. The MPs also criticised the MoD for failing to provide the NAO with information it had requested on time. ‘This must not happen again,’ Mrs Hodge said. Shadow defence secretary Vernon Coaker said the report showed a ‘litany of catastrophic failures’. ‘These criticisms are hugely embarrassing for the Government during the week that the UK is hosting the Nato summit and when David Cameron has called for Britain's international partners to meet their defence obligations,’ he said. ‘His advice to the neighbours would be better received and have greater credibility if he had his own house in order.’ Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: ‘The chief of the general staff and I are confident that we will reach our target of 30,000 trained army reservists by 2018/19. Indeed, we have arrested the many years of decline and neglect that has plagued our reserve forces and now we need to build on that. ‘Our Army 2020 plans are on track and will deliver by 2020 the army we need to counter the wide range of threats we face. ‘Working closely with the Army and Capita, we have already addressed many of the points raised in this report, including streamlining medical and security clearance procedures, with further planned improvements on the medical process, empowering and incentivising local units to recruit, and running a high-profile recruitment campaign. ‘This is seeing a steady stream of recruits coming through the door. Our targets are challenging but they are achievable. With a Government investment of £1.8 billion in better training and equipment, I believe that many young people will realise the great offer we have for challenging and exciting roles in the reserves.’","Government reforms to the Army intended to save more than £10bn by 2020 .

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . The beer made famous by Homer Simpson will be stripped from liquor store shevles across Australia because of its appeal to under-age drinkers. Duff Beer will no longer be sold at Woolworths-owned liquor stores across the country, after a panel of advertisising experts deemed the packaging and marketing of the product had 'a strong appeal to children and adolescents'. The Alcohol Beverages Advertising Code upheld complaints lodged by the Alcohol Policy Coalition - described as a 'coalition of Victorian based health and social agencies' - which had been advocating against its sale. Duff Beer has been made into a easily recognisable brand by Homer Simpson who loves drinking it on The Simpsons . The ABCA agreed that the beer 'through its name and packaging has strongor evident appeal to children or adolescents' because of its cartoon-inspired origins. The panel of three board members concluded that the Beer's packaging, colour scheme and layout had a close association with The Simpsons and for this reason would draw the 'immediate and close attention of under 18 year olds' who have grown up with the program. 'The basic point raised by the complaint is that by converting the fictional Duff beer of The Simpsons into a real product must mean that the product will have a strong or evident appeal to children,' the determination stated. It stated that a big factor in breaching the code was the beer's direct association with the cartoon and the influence this has had on children over its lifetime. 'It is reasonable to say that if there was no Simpsons association, then simply having an alcohol product named ‘Duff’, and the packaging, colour scheme and layout used  could not of itself be said to have strong or evident appeal to underage persons.' The $45 a cartoon beer will be discontinued from stock at Woolwroths-owned liquor chains across the country . The ABCA  upheld compaints by the Alcohol Policy Coalition over fears it lured in young children and was to closely linked to the cartoon The Simpsons . A Woolworths Liquor Group spokesperson said the $45 a carton sale of the beer would which began rolling out on shelves in May, will be discontinued. She said remaining stock will still be sold. 'We respect the panel’s adjudication and will discontinue the stock,' she said. The panel accepted in its decicion that the supplier (Woolworths Liquor Group) is committed to the standards of good alcohol beverage marketing contained in ABAC. Ealirer this year the Australian Medical Association president Steve Hambleton said the new alcoholic beer would increase 'the social acceptability of alcohol misuse'. 'People have been watching The Simpsons for years, this is ready-made product placement and dangerous exposure to people misusing alcohol,' he said. 'We’ve talked in the past about the effects of exposing young children to alcohol advertising, here it is in spades.' The Simpsons cartoon has been airing on Channel Ten for more than 20 years. Woolworths is planning to stock the iconic beer in its BWS and Dan Murphys stores . The ABCA  upheld compaints by the Alcohol Policy Coalition over fears it lured in young children and was to closely linked to the cartoon The Simpsons . A pop-up bar dedicated to the beer's Australian landing is being held at Sydney's Woolloomooloo Bay Hotel for seven days and Duff also has its own Facebook page. But the spokeswoman stressed to the Canberra Times that 'all materials have adhered to alcohol advertising codes'. Dr Hambleton's comments come after repeated calls from the AMA to launch a parliamentary inquiry into alcohol advertising. AMA president Steve Hambleton says the introduction of Duff Beer will make heavy drinking more socially acceptable because of its association with the cartoon series . He said research showed underage drinking prevents young people from realising when they are drunk. It has been quite a trial for Duff beer to even make it to Australian shores. In the 1990s, brewers Lion Nathan were unsuccessful in trying to produce a version of the beer after the move was blocked by Twentieth Century Fox, who own the trademark to the brand, in the Federal Court in 1996. Perth's Allstates Liquor Wholesalers were handed a 'cease and desist' by Fox in 2011 after stocking a beer called 'Legendary Duff Beer' with a remarkably similar label and logo to the one depicted in The Simpsons.

"By . Ollie Gillman for MailOnline . A British businessman has raised thousands of pounds to rescue a neglected tiger from a zoo in Greece. David Barnes, who runs a bookshop in Uppingham, Leicestershire, has almost raised the £11,500 needed to save the 485lb tiger, called Phevos, from the cash-strapped zoo in the town of Trikala. Phevos, who is 15 years old, has been alone in his enclosure since March, when his long-time companion Athena died after an infected wound on her paw went untreated. Scroll down for video . Phevos, a 485lb 15-year-old tiger, was moved to Trikala zoo, in north-west Greece in 2001 after being rescued from an Italian travelling circus . After the financial crisis in Greece, he has received less care. Earlier this year his long-time partner, Athena, died after an infected wound on her paw went untreated . The tiger was rescued from a travelling Italian circus by the Greek authorities in 2001, and was taken to Trikala zoo, in the north-west of the country. However, following the financial crisis, the condition of the zoo has deteriorated, leaving Phevos alone and in a 'poor' enclosure. Since then David Barnes, who used to work for the Animal Welfare Fund in Greece and has re-homed dozens of exotic animals in the past 20 years, has been trying to find a new home for the tiger. After months of fundraising, Mr Barnes, 62, has managed to get the money together to move Phevos to a sanctuary near San Diego, California. He said:  'When Phevos and Athena arrived at the zoo, the enclosure was not very good and I persuaded them to build a new one and things were going well. 'Then ... the financial crisis hit Greece and after that things changed.' Former RSPCA inspector David Barnes, who runs a bookshop in Leicestershire, has raised nearly £11,500 - enough to move Phevos from the Greek zoo to an enclosure in San Diego, California . Former RSPCA inspector Mr Barnes lost track of the situation after having to undergo his second heart bypass operation. He added: 'I got a phone call saying I should go and see Athena who was bleeding from a wound in her paw which had become infected. She died under anaesthetic.' Mr Barnes swung into action and set up a fundraising website to spare Phevos a similar fate by raising £11,500 to transfer him to a sanctuary for lions, tigers and bears near San Diego, in California. He added: 'Phevos is still in Greece but he is being checked on frequently by a vet friend and so far he is OK. 'I have raised just over £10,400 so just £1,100 to go. Whatever I'm short of will go on my credit card.' He is now awaiting the paperwork to allow Phevos to be flown to California via Frankfurt, in Germany. He added: 'I started applying to carry out the move in April and I'm hoping to go next month. It's the biggest and most challenging thing I've done. 'I will stay with him throughout the trip, he knows me very well, I am able to feed him and stroke him in his enclosure. 'I want him to go soon and start his new life, I know he'll be in good hands as the sanctuary he's going to was recommended to me by a vet. 'There's a 16-year-old female in the enclosure next to him where he's going, I hope they might get to like each other.' Mr Barnes, who has a 23-year-old Greek cat, Naomi, which he calls his 'own little tiger,' said he was very grateful to everyone who responded to the appeal and helping with his mission to re-home Phevos.

"By . Dan Bloom for MailOnline . Campaigners say just one seahorse has been spotted this year in what used to be Britain's largest colony after pleasure boats churned up the animals' habitat. Studland Bay, Dorset, was the only British site where both the spiny and short-snouted species were known to breed in recent years and a survey found more than 40 seahorses in 2008. But activists say the number has dwindled, and an 80-hour survey lasting several weeks this summer found no seahorses at all. Alone: This spiny seahorse was the only one spotted this year in Dorset's Studland Bay, which used to be the largest breeding colony in Britain, according to the Seahorse Trust. It wants more restrictions on boat owners . Beauty spot: Studland Bay attracts boat owners throughout the summer - but they deny they are responsible . The Seahorse Trust, which has long campaigned unsuccessfully for Studland Bay to become a Marine Conservation Zone, has been notified of just one sighting all year. The lone spiny seahorse was spotted last month off Studland's Middle Beach, near the Trust's study area, by underwater cameraman Andy Jackson in a 20-hour search. Mr Jackson, who films documentary footage for his firm SubSeaTV, told MailOnline: 'I've wanted to film a seahorse for a number of years and I spent 20 hours of diving time looking for one. 'I had about an hour following it - it was incredible. 'They're so camouflaged. This one was coiled up with the texture of its back matching the seaweed behind it.' The campaigners say eelgrass in the bay's shallow waters, which provides a crucial habitat for the creatures, is being destroyed by the anchors of yachts and pleasure boats. Underwater cameraman Andy Jackson said: 'I had about an hour following it - it was incredible' On one sunny day in July, as many as 350 boats were recorded in the bay - and when the tide goes out, they end up resting on the fragile seaweed. Mr Jackson admitted that with the seahorses' power of camouflage, there may be more hidden in the bay which have not been spotted. And boat owners have attacked The Seahorse Trust's claims, insisting they are not responsible and saying the figures are being spun to put unnecessary restrictions on them. But Mr Jackson insisted: 'Something's definitely changed. There were lots of sightings in 2009 and 2010 and they weren't so hard to find. People could see two or three on one dive. 'I've seen and filmed the anchor damage myself and seen what it does to the eelgrass. 'Whether it's a natural cycle and they'll return again, I don't know, but when you see the damage done by anchors it's a no-brainer - that must be stopped. 'You wouldn't have to get rid of the boats. It's just a case of putting in moorings that don't damage the seabed.' Five years ago marine experts recorded 40 individual spiny seahorses at Studland and one pair of the short-snouted species. Since then the Trust says numbers have fallen steadily, with only four spiny seahorses spotted in 2013 and no short-snouted animals. The male found by Mr Jackson was believed to be a juvenile. Young seahorses are transient, which means the one pictured may not have been resident to Studland Bay. Conservationists are warning that unless urgent action is taken to protect their habitat, seahorses will be lost forever at Studland. Dorset-based marine conservationist Steve Trewhella said: 'This summer divers have searched Studland Bay two or three times a day for two or three hours a time. Rare find: The animals are masters of camouflage, and can change colour to match the seaweed around them . 'Both myself and Andy have carried out thorough searches on the site and others have also been looking for these animals and this is still the only one seen in 2014. 'We need to protect this site before it is too late and we lose them forever.' Seahorse Trust director Neil Garrick-Maidment added: 'Studland is or was the most important colony for seahorses in the UK and now that colony has all but gone. 'The whole thing is incredibly saddening. Our warnings about the habitat destruction haven’t been heeded by people in authority. I hate to say it but these statistics prove we were right. 'But I am an optimist and I believe if we can get Marine Conservation Zone status the area might recover and seahorses might start to come back again in numbers.' Spiny seahorses are named after the prickly, fleshy spines which arch down the length of their necks and can change colour to blend in with plants on the sea bed. Their Latin namehippocampus histrix, the animals breed in coastal waters during the summer months and have been sighted off various points on the British coast. It is the males who become pregnant and give birth, and they have been known to produce broods of more than 500 young. The animals hunt by waiting in until prey swims close to their snouts, which then suck in a sharp intake of water including the day's meal. Seahorses pair for life and even after they have mated for the first time, they perform elaborate courting displays lasting up to an hour. Sources: BBC Nature / Seahorse Trust . Studland Bay has been recommended for Marine Conservation Zone status and the government's Department for the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) is considering the bid. The move would force boat owners to use environmentally-friendly mooring buoys which ensure they do not have to anchor or lie flat on the sea bed. Jon Reid, a spokesman for the Boat Owners’ Response Group, denied his members were destroying the eelgrass. 'Studland Bay has been used by generations of boat owners, going back the last 70 years and eelgrass has always been there,' he said. 'Why is there suddenly an issue now? 'There is a huge body of evidence from worldwide research that states that this type of eel grass is very resilient and if damaged it puts on a growth spurt to recover. 'It is wrong to say that boat owners are causing long term damage to it. There are unusual holes in the eel grass but there are also the same holes in the eel grass outside of the anchoring area so how do you explain that.' He added Studland was used more in 2008 than it is now and there could be manifold reasons why the animals' numbers had declined. A Defra spokesman said: 'We are doing more than ever to protect our marine environment, with 27 MCZs designated last year and a further two more phases of designation expected over the next few years. 'We already have over 500 Marine Protected Areas in UK waters and just under 25 per cent of English inshore waters are already within MPAs.'","Studland Bay in Dorset had more than 40 spiny seahorses in a 2008 survey .

"By . Alasdair Glennie for the Daily Mail . But Barlow, who has not posted anything on his account since May, has now returned - with his first Tweets apologising to his fans for the stories regarding his tax avoidance, followed by a vow to 'settle things' Up till now he has kept rather quiet about the controversy surrounding his financial dealings. But Gary Barlow has finally broken his four-month silence over his tax avoidance with an apology … and a plug for his new album. The Take That singer was accused of ‘cynicism’ as he addressed the issue in a series of messages to his 3.5million Twitter followers. Barlow said he was sorry ‘to anyone who was offended by the tax stories’. But some fans said it fell short of heartfelt contrition as he did not express regret for the fact he failed to pay tax. And alongside the cursory apology, he announced that the band have been working on a new record. Earlier this year it was revealed the 43-year-old, his bandmates Howard Donald, 46, and Mark Owen, 42, and their manager Jonathan Wild face a multimillion-pound tax bill for attempting to shelter £66million in a tax-avoidance scheme called Icebreaker. Days after the revelations, Barlow’s Twitter account was hacked by someone who wrote an offensive post about his stillborn baby, prompting him to stay off the social networking site. Returning to Twitter for the first time since May 7, the star said: ‘Hey everyone! I’m back from seven productive weeks in the US and I’m back on Twitter! I’ve had a break from Twitter after someone hacked my account and some very upsetting and disturbing text was written. ‘Over the summer I’ve remembered that I have so many supporters, friends and fans on here so why let 1 person ruin all the fun. ‘I want to apologise to anyone who was offended by the tax stories earlier this year. With a new team of accountants we are working to settle things with all parties involved ASAP.’ Barlow, who has not posted anything on his account since May, has now returned - with his first Tweets apologising to his fans for the stories regarding his tax avoidance, followed by a vow to 'settle things' Last . night, MPs welcomed the apology, but said it should have come sooner . and questioned whether he would now pay back the tax he managed to avoid . through the Icebreaker scheme. Tory . MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘There is no free pass for people who abuse . our tax system. Increasingly they will be found out, have to pay their . fair share and risk public anger to boot. It’s welcome to see Gary . Barlow putting his hand up. 'But he could have held it up a little higher . and sooner than he has.’ Labour . MP John Mann added: ‘We all look forward to him confirming that he will . pay back all the tax that he avoided.’ And moments after the posts . about his tax affairs, Barlow started plugging his new ventures: ‘We . have been working since the new year on a new Take That studio album. Bandmates: Gary Barlow with Howard Donald in a picture on Twitter . 'We . are extremely excited about it! It has been four long years since the . last one. It’s so nice to be back in the band!’ Many of Barlow’s fans reacted positively to his statement, with one saying: ‘You’re only human and we all make mistakes.’ But . others questioned the timing of his apology. One said it was ‘hollow’ and ‘non-committal’, adding: ‘Only sorry coz [sic] he was named and . shamed. Timing is to drum up interest for upcoming album. Cynical.’ Another added: ‘I wasn’t offended by the stories, I was offended by you . not paying tax, Gary. Because I have a moral compass.’ Barlow’s . investment in Icebreaker was first revealed in 2012. This year, a tax . judge decided it was ‘known and understood by all concerned to be a tax . avoidance scheme’. It allowed the Take That members to avoid tax on around £63million made through world tours and CD sales. There is no suggestion that the other band members, Jason Orange and Robbie Williams, invested in the Icebreaker schemes.","Barlow left Twitter after his account was hacked in and a deeply offensive message was posted about his stillborn child .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A security guard died when his car was hit by a train at a level crossing just days before his retirement, an inquest heard yesterday. Dennis France, 65, who had not been late for work in 20 years, waited a couple of minutes at the crossing after the barrier stayed down for longer than usual, before deciding to drive around it. But a train travelling at 100mph struck his car, killing him instantly and pushing his red Peugeot down the line for almost a mile. Scroll down for video . Dennis France, 65, was killed instantly when the London-bound train collided with his red Peugeot 306 . Mr France, a front of house security officer at Debenhams in Taunton, is believed to have been running late for work on March 21 last year - the day he died . Mr France, who was two days away from his retirement party, was declared dead at the scene. He had worked at the Debenhams headquarters in Taunton, Somerset, for 20 years and took the same route to work every day. There was no suggestion of suicide and friends said the only possible reason was that he did not want to be late, the inquest in Taunton heard. Close friend Alison Chedham, 48, said: ‘He was very punctual at work, he was very proud of that fact … To my mind he had never been late for work and he thought he was going to be. He didn’t want to be late, he was a very conscientious man.’ The Rail Accident Investigation Branch told the hearing that Mr France, from Curload, near Stoke St Gregory, Somerset, may have believed the crossing at Athelney had failed after engineering work had affected the timing sequence. It was estimated the barrier, which consisted of a single pole across half the road on either side, stayed down for a maximum of 103 seconds before the train’s arrival, longer than the usual 29 seconds. Mr France's retirement party was planned for two days after the horrific crash which claimed his life . The train, which was travelling at around 100mph at the point of impact, was travelling from Exeter St David's . Mr France's car was destroyed in the crash, which happened at around 6.23am - 23 minutes after he woke up . A report by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch said Mr France may have believed the crossing had failed after engineering work had affected the timing sequence . The level crossing Mr France drove on to in Athelney, Somerset, lies approximately 10 miles east of Taunton . The train was travelling eastwards towards London Paddington when it hit Mr France's Peugeot 306 . The barriers were down for a maximum of 103 seconds, longer than the usual 29 seconds, the report said . Daniel Hembrow, who was driving his green Land Rover in the opposite direction, said: ‘It all happened so quick. I heard the impact and saw something large flying through the air. I was later told this was the engine. I got out to see if there was anything I could do and when I looked down the track you could just see the train in the distance.’ Train driver William Ashton, who was taking the train from Exeter St David’s to London Paddington, told the court he had seen green lights leading up to the crossing, which assured him it was a clear route. He added: ‘As the train was approaching the crossing I saw a red car come from my right in front of me. ‘As it moved on to the crossing itself I immediately pushed the brakes into the emergency stop position. Then I saw the train hit the car. 'I hadn’t seen if anybody was in the car because it all happened so quickly. I was immediately in shock, I honestly couldn’t believe what had happened.’ The train continued down the tracks with its brakes on before it came to a stop after around three quarters of a mile. Mr France, who was divorced, had moved to the rural village from London to fulfil his dream of country living and kept many chickens, which were his ‘pride and joy’. He was killed on March 21 last year. The inquest continues.","Dennis France, 65, was running late for work on March 21 last year .

"By . Steve Doughty for the Daily Mail . Britons are far more likely to work beyond the retirement age than any of their counterparts in the main EU nations, official figures revealed yesterday. Nearly one in five continue in employment after the age of 65 in the UK – more than three times the number in France and almost double that in Germany. And growing evidence suggests they often do so to help support their grandchildren. Scroll down for video . Nearly one in five continue in employment after the age of 65 in the UK – more than three times the number in France and almost double that in Germany (file picture) Only in a handful of the EU’s less developed countries is there a higher proportion of working pensioners than in the UK. Figures for 2012, published by the EU’s statistics arm Eurostat, found that 19.4 per cent of Britons aged 65 to 69 were in employment. In France, which has failed to shrug off the recession and where unemployment remains at record levels, only 5.9 per cent had jobs. That compares with 12.7 in the Netherlands, 11.1 in Germany, 8 in Italy and 6.6 in Belgium. Across the 28 nations of the EU – where the average employment rate among over-65s was 11 per cent – only Estonia, Romania and Portugal had a higher proportion of people working beyond the retirement age. And those three countries all have far less developed economies than the UK. There is growing evidence that many work past their retirement age for financial reasons, separate research shows. In particular, pensioners are increasingly under pressure to help out their children, who are faced with the difficulties of raising their own young families. They use the cash they earn to pay for childcare and extras for the grandchildren – but it means they have less free time to help look after them. A study commissioned by insurance and pensions company Aegon UK found that 29 per cent of workers in Britain intend to remain in employment at least part-time during the early years of their retirement to increase their incomes. It suggested that the growing number of people staying in work into their late 60s and beyond is likely to mean there will be fewer grandparents who are willing to devote their time to looking after their grandchildren (file) It suggested that the growing number of people staying in work into their late 60s and beyond is likely to mean there will be fewer grandparents who are willing to devote their time to looking after their grandchildren. At present, nearly 10million grandparents are thought to care for their grandchildren while their children are at work. ‘Many parents rely on the generosity of a grandparent to help with childcare,’ said David Macmillan of Aegon UK. ‘And this trend may have a significant impact on the amount parents need to set aside for childcare costs. ‘We may well see grandparents continuing to work not just for their own financial needs but in order to support younger family members with childcare costs, school fees and broader costs such as the ability to get on the housing ladder.’ The Aegon UK poll, which was conducted by Cicero Consulting, questioned 16,000 adults in 15 countries.","Evidence suggests they carry on so they can support their grandchildren .

"By . Paul Harris for the Daily Mail . They came to London from their native Italy in search of new lives. Palmira and Domenico Silva met, married, started a family and began a successful restaurant business. But six decades on from the day they set foot in the capital, Mrs Silva would become a tragic victim of the other side of Britain, horrifically slaughtered in her garden by a machete-wielding killer. Scroll down for video . Killed: Great-grandmother Palmira Silva was found beheaded on Thursday in a horrific attack more than six decades after she and her husband Domenico came from their native Italy to start a new life in London . Happy family: Palmira and her late husband Domenico with their now grown-up children, Celestina and Rino . Last night members of the 82-year-old widow’s extended family were in shock as they struggled to come to terms with how anyone could murder a great-grandmother described by neighbours and those who got to know her as ‘an angel… a lovely, smiling grandma’. Her daughter Celestina told the Daily Mail: ‘It’s just the most horrendous thing to do to another human being. We simply can’t make any sense of it.’ Mrs Silva arrived in Britain from southern Italy in the 1950s and immediately found a job as a nanny. Domenico had travelled separately to England but knew he had found his future wife from the moment he first saw her. Together they saved enough money to fulfil a dream of starting their own business and raised Celestina and a son, Rino, making sure they immersed themselves in English culture without forgetting their Italian roots. They ran a succession of cafes and snack bars in different parts of the city before settling in North London. Tributes: Tributes gathered outside one of the London snack bars which had been run by the 82-year-old . Mr Silva died in 2008 but in Edmonton, the family continued the business with Silva’s Cafe building up a solid base of regular customers who enjoyed Mrs Silva’s friendliness as much as her food. She had only recently stopped working full time at the cafe that she and her son ran in Church Street, a few minutes walk from her home. Known there as Pam, she had become a much loved and familiar face, gradually handing over the running to Rino, now 53, after her husband died. But London changed dramatically over the years. Knife crime, murders, gangs – all became commonplace. Mrs Silva had been back from a family holiday in Italy for only a week when she became the latest victim, hacked to death and left in a pool of blood. Celestina, 49, said: ‘She knew the area was changing but she was determined to stay. It seems such a dreadful, senseless waste.’ Yesterday friends and local residents paid tribute to Mrs Silva and sent condolences to her family. Investigation: Police at the scene on Thursday in Edmonton, north London . Dilek Solma, 19, who works in a shop next door, described her as ‘an angel with a lovely smile’ adding: ‘She was really kind… just so nice.’ Andrew Zouvani, 66, owner of Guy’s Hair Salon opposite the cafe, said: ‘I’ve known her for 35 years, I used to go over and she would serve me drinks, she was really nice. ‘She was a very nice lady, and she wouldn’t give up working. We would joke that I couldn’t understand her after 35 years because of her strong Italian accent.’ Chris Moles, 44, a worker at a Church Street florist, said: ‘She was a very friendly lady. She was lovely really, like a lovely grandma.’ By last night the cafe had become a focal point for tributes, a carpet of flowers and wreaths growing in front of the shuttered doors. Most were left by shocked friends, customers and nearby local businesses, one describing her as ‘a truly wonderful lady’. Another encapsulated local anger and grief in six poignant words: ‘One more angel taken,’ it said. ‘So sad.’ Under guard, loner who never had a job . By SAM GREENHILL and CHRISTIAN GYSIN . This is the man charged with the gruesome murder of great-grandmother Palmira Silva. Nicholas Salvador, 25, is unemployed and was staying with a friend a few doors from the 82-year-old widow in Edmonton, North London. Nicknamed ‘Fat Nick’, the would-be cage fighter being held by police left home 11 years ago. Under guard: Nicholas Salvador, 25 (left), was arrested after the brutal beheading of Palmira Silva (right) Last night a friend said: ‘Nicholas is an only child and his parents brought him here from Nigeria. But when he was about 13 or 14 he left home. The truth is, he has never felt loved. He has been unlucky all his life. ‘He was always down, he never smiled, he never had any money. He was a known failure.’ Another friend said: ‘He is from a Muslim background but he is not a good Muslim – he gambles, plays roulette. When he left home his mum found him a room somewhere and said she would pay two months’ rent, and after that he was on his own.’ A former classmate at Salisbury School, Edmonton, said: ‘We used to call him St Nicholas because he never got up to anything. He was always saying he wanted a girlfriend.’ Virgin Media worker Myrvin Kirwan, 36, who was in the house next door when the murder happened on Thursday, said: ‘He jumped over the fence and he was standing there with a machete. He had blood on his hands. A friend said: ‘He was always down, he never smiled, he never had any money. He was a known failure.’ 'He was looking straight at me, but it was almost as if he was looking straight through me.’ Yesterday Salvador was under armed guard in hospital and he was charged with murder late last night. The Metropolitan Police also charged him with assaulting a police officer. He is due before Highbury Corner magistrates in north London later this morning.

"By . Madlen Davies for MailOnline . A young girl suffering a rare condition, which causes her to vomit up to 30 times a day, has beaten the illness by taking up karate. Megan Stone, six, was diagnosed with cyclical vomiting syndrome which can cause her to throw up uncontrollably for up to 14 hours a day when an attack hits. At her lowest ebb, she couldn't take part in any activities without being constantly sick. She took days to recover after attacks and was so weak from vomiting she could barely stand and struggled to walk back from school. For years Megan Stone, 6, would have attacks causing her vomit for up to 14 hours due to rare condition Cyclical Vomitting Syndrome, until she found karate lessons helped ease the illness . After taking up martial arts Megan's attacks halved in frequency and severity. Her mother said this is due to Megan's body building up stamina . But after Megan, from Swansea in south Wales started taking karate lessons the number of attacks she suffers has almost halved. Her mother Rachel Stone, 35 said she believes this is down to Megan's body building up stamina. Megan's condition is so rare that three different doctors were unable to diagnose her illness, but offered theories ranging from viral infections, allergies and bulimia. But after almost two years of being almost constantly sick, Megan was referred to a specialist who diagnosed her with cyclical vomiting syndrome (CVS) - a rare condition which causes suffers to vomit for long periods without interval. She was suffering an attack every couple of weeks - but after starting martial arts classes, the frequency and length of the attacks has been dramatically cut. Mrs Stone, a support worker for adults with learning disabilities said seeing her daughter so ill made her feel helpless as a mother. She said: 'It's horrendous seeing her when she's really ill, I feel useless as a mum you just want to take the pain away and make her feel better. 'She's so exhausted during and after the episodes that she can barely stand. 'We just carry her if she needs the toilet or to get to the doctors because her legs are like jelly and she's so dizzy. 'I started taking my son Jack to karate in 2012 to try and build up his confidence, but Megan was too young then and too ill. Rachel Stone, 35, with husband Robert, 36, son Jack, 8 said that karate has not only helped daughter Megan's condition, but is an integral part of her family's life . 'But she could see how much Jack was enjoying it and she was desperate to go, so at the end of last year, she started going and hasn't looked back.' Learning that Megan could take karate lessons- and that they helped with her condition- was a massive help, Mrs Stone added. She said: 'Meg had struggled to find any other activity she could keep up with, she even struggled to walk home from school without getting sick. CVS symptoms are shared by many other conditions, and diagnosis is by ruling out every other cause. Because of this it can be years before reaching a diagnosis, and any effective treatment. Many CVS sufferers with short and relatively infrequent attacks are often told it’s “a stomach bug” and receive little or no help for many years. In other sufferers psychological causes are often considered, when the cause is actually CVS this often delays treatment and adds stress to an already difficult situation. Awareness of CVS in the medical profession has increased but CVS is still, all too often, overlooked as a potential diagnosis. There have been no large, well-controlled studies, to show which drugs work best but a number of treatments are available to both stop, or reduce the severity of an attack, or to prevent the attack from starting. Recent research suggests that mitochondrial DNA mutations may play a role in CVS and that it may be an inherited condition passed down the maternal line. 'But it turned out karate was the perfect outlet, it was a massive turning point. Now her body is strong she can recover quickly, which is amazing. 'Before karate it used to take her days to get better, but it's really chopped the recovery period in half. 'Karate has not just helped my daughter, it's become an integral part of our family life.' Megan first started showing symptoms of the rare condition - which typically develops during childhood - at the age of three when she would experience dizziness, stomach cramps, and excessive perspiration. From that point, she would have attacks of severe vomiting every few weeks, causing her family to become increasingly concerned for her health. At a loss as to how to treat her condition, baffled doctors put her on anti-sickness medicine to prevent the nausea. Her body instantly rejected the tablets, regurgitating anything she attempted to swallow. It wasn't until she was referred to a specialist at age four that Megan was diagnosed with the vomiting disorder. The diagnosis had come after years of confusion and difficulty managing Megan's condition, said Mrs Stone. She said: 'The doctors seemed clueless and so were we. 'The episodes were put down to viral infections, bugs, something she ate, but we knew deep down that it was something worse. 'No one else in the family was ill and after nearly a year she was finally sent to a specialist and was diagnosed with CVS, something I had never heard of before. 'We manage her episodes with paracetamol for the pain and try to keep her hydrated with ice lollies.' Megan wanted to try karate because her brother Jack, 8, enjoyed it so much . But the diagnosis brought no relief. Although doctors knew what was wrong with Megan they were unable to help her - and it was only when she joined her local karate club that her family noticed a difference in her symptoms. Megan has now passed three belts with distinctions and will be grading for her next belt in the Lil Dragons programme in September. Dr Robin Dover, Chair of the Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome Association UK, said: 'CVS affects approximately 2 per cent of the school age population but is probably as frequent in adults too - onset can be at any age. 'It is a poorly understood condition in which the sufferers are usually healthy and normal between episodes but have debilitating attacks of relentless nausea and vomiting. 'Attacks last between 1-4 days for most people but can last as long as two weeks in extreme cases, with vomiting up to six times an hour. 'Attacks in some sufferers happen in a regular pattern, i.e. every couple of weeks or months. In others there is no clear pattern.'","Megan Stone, 6, was diagnosed with rare  Cyclical Vomiting Syndrome .

"By . Mark Wilson for the Daily Mail . Nothing seems too pretty in the wider situation around Rangers these days as discord and intrigue dominate. Rarely, however, has winning ugly felt quite so satisfying for a club desperate to remind of its power on the pitch. A first victory over Premiership opposition in two years was secured thanks to a deflected drive from youngster Lewis Macleod. It came late in a tie that was mostly a grim war of attrition, but those aesthetic merits mattered little to Ally McCoist and his players. Three times in succession they had come up short in cup competitions when faced by opposition from the top division. Inverness delivered the first of those blows with a 3-0 cruise at Ibrox in October 2012, but last night brought a very different outcome. Rangers players celebrate an ugly 1-0 victory over Inverness CT in the Scottish League Cup . Youngster Lewis MacLeod scored the game's only goal late in the second half at Ibrox . Rangers (4-4-2): Simonsen; McGregor, Mohsni, McCulloch, Wallace; Aird (Templeton 73), Law, Black, Macleod; Boyd (Daly 72), Clark. Subs not used: Robinson, Smith, Peralta, Shiels, Zaliukas. Booked: Black, Macleod. Inverness CT (4-2-3-1): Brill; Raven, Warren, Meekings, Tremarco; Polworth, Tansey; Willams (Christie 73), Watkins, Doran; MacKay. Subs not used: Esson, Devine, Horner, Ross. Booked: Doran, Tansey. Referee: Crawford Allan. Attendance: 15,208. Man of the Match: Lewis Macleod. A trip to face Falkirk in the last 16 of the League Cup is Rangers’ reward, yet a psychological barrier may also have been breached. In trying to show they can still cut it against the country’s leading teams — as their wage budget suggests they should — this was a significant breakthrough. One look around the stadium would confirm, however, that Ibrox is still a long way away from welcoming back the good old days. A crowd of just 15,208 was present, surely a reflection of the distrust that exists between supporters and the board. That is a situation only further aggravated by the mysterious case of Rafat Rizvi and the Malaysian delegation. Yet Inverness could not capitalise on the lack of an intimidating atmosphere. In truth, John Hughes’ side were well short of the form that marked their impressive start to the season and took them to the Premiership summit. The chance of a second successive final in this competition has vanished, with Hughes left to try to regroup after back-to-back defeats. A crowd of around only 15,000 supporters celebrate victory after the final whistle at Ibrox . Given the pretty much universal opinion that Friday night’s 4-0 win over Raith Rovers in Kirkcaldy had been their most convincing 90 minutes of the season, it was little surprise that McCoist opted to field an identical starting line-up. The desire to prove a point was significant for all at Ibrox but Inverness also had bountiful motivation after League Cup glory slipped away following their defeat on penalties to Aberdeen at Celtic Park in March. Boss Hughes had attempted to influence the psychology of the tie by insisting Rangers should be viewed as favourites. They were also words to try to lessen the expectation on the shoulders of his squad, after an exemplary start to the Premiership campaign was halted by a 3-1 defeat at Partick Thistle. Suspensions to Graeme Shinnie and Ross Draper forced alterations regardless of that result and were perhaps reflected in a distinctly fractured opening to the game. The piecemeal pattern persisted for the bulk of the first half. Rangers striker Kris Boyd (2R) wins a header during a lacklustre first half . Rangers manager Ally McCoist (C) shakes hands with Boyd after he was taken off in the second half . No one could argue about the level of commitment shown by either side, with relentless harrying of opponents taking place in every corner of the pitch. What was absent, however, was any composure in the positive aspects of play. The best chance fell to Rangers and, perhaps predictably, to Kris Boyd. With 16 minutes gone, Liam Polworth gifted the ball to Nicky Clark and allowed him to feed his strike partner. Boyd’s first touch took him clear of the Inverness centre-halves but a toe-poked effort was diverted wide by the left foot of Dean Brill. Ibrox groaned in frustration. That emotion continued to loom large, with misplaced passes sent in every conceivable direction. Some of Ian Black’s long-range deliveries were a particular source of ire before he became the first booking for a foot up against Danny Williams. Aaron Doran promptly evened up the crime count by taking down Fraser Aird after the winger had evaded two team-mates. Inverness' David Raven (C) takes a tumble as his side battles for possession during a scrappy game . Rangers' Nicky Clark (L) fires in a rare shot on goal during the Scottish League Cup encounter . Rangers looked marginally more threatening but could hardly be described as fluent. Their visitors had toiled to get arch-poacher Billy McKay involved, although they did fashion an opportunity when Greg Tansey skidded a low pass through for Marley Watkins. He could, though, only hit a tame shot directly at Steve Simonsen after the back-tracking Bilel Mohsni applied sufficient pressure. It was more in keeping with events that the half should close with another pair of cautions. Referee Crawford Allan first pulled up Tansey for toppling Law before Macleod earned a yellow card for a rash lunge on Watkins. A mistake looked the most likely route towards a breakthrough and one almost arrived 12 minutes after the restart via a player who is no stranger to a lapse. Mohsni either thought the referee had stopped play or simply had no idea Watkins was behind him when he attempted the most casual of turns on the edge of his area. The Caley Thistle winger gladly accepted the gift and advanced to deliver a low cross that saw Darren McGregor squeeze out McKay at the far post. The Tunisian international owed a large debt of gratitude to his colleague. Aird then wasted a promising position for Rangers when he had possession pinched from him by Carl Tremarco. MacLeod celebrates giving Rangers their first win over Premiership opposition for two years . The general quality remained dismal but it took until the 73rd minute for changes to be made by both sides. Jon Daly and David Tempelton replaced Boyd and Aird, while Williams made way for Ryan Christie. Templeton promptly smashed a long-range off target before the decisive goal finally arrived after 78 minutes in suitably scrappy fashion. Rangers hollered for a hand-ball as Nicky Law tried to nick his way beyond Tansey. The ball broke to Macleod and his low strike took a wicked deflection off Josh Meekings to beat Brill. Inverness staged a desperate late push for a leveller, with Black forced to clear a Christie header off the line in the final minute. There was still time for Gary Warren to have another header ruled out for offside before Ibrox had its long-awaited scalp.","Rangers defeated Inverness CT 1-0 in the Scottish League Cup .

He now returns to the same country - having made his first-team comeback three weeks ahead of schedule against Aberdeen last Saturday - hoping to reverse a poor run of European results for the champions this season. Scott Brown has been injured since a pre-season match against Rapid Vienna in July . Brown made his comeback three weeks ahead of schedule against Aberdeen last Saturday . Brown has trained this week and says he is ready for his first 90 minutes of the season on Thursday . An energising force for the Scottish champions as he managed an hour in the 2-1 victory over the Dons at Parkhead, Brown says his hamstring now feels strong and pain free after his muscle tore off the bone. ‘It ripped apart,’ reflected the Scotland midfielder. ‘That’s what happens. I shouldn’t try to stretch at 29. ‘I had done a good warm-up and I can’t blame the temperature, it was 35 degrees. It was just one of those freak accidents that happen, you overstretch and it just snaps. ‘I have to be honest, it was the sorest pain I’ve ever had but in the few days afterwards I felt good, I thought I was going to be back. I just kept pushing myself as far as possible. ‘I thought it was maybe just a wee tweak of the hamstring or something, it was a couple of days later I was walking and feeling fine. It was only when you get the MRI scan, until then you don’t really know what’s going to happen.’ The diagnosis was for a three-month absence. In the event, he returned earlier than anyone anticipated. Celtic captain Brown was in good spirits in training in training last week .

Asked if he can last the full game in Salzburg, Brown shrugged: ‘I’ll take it as it goes. I feel good just now and that’s three days after the game. ‘I trained today so everything’s feeling good and I’ll just try to push myself as far as possible and test the boundaries - but my hamstring is feeling as good as it’s ever felt so long may that continue. ‘It was a relief to come through the first training session, let alone the first game. Especially when it was coming to 35, 50 minutes on the clock and I had a look up and I was breathing hard. ‘You think: “Ten minutes still to go here, Scott, try to get a touch of the ball and try to kid on you’re still looking forward to passing.” But it was hard. ‘Everyone’s first game back is always exactly the same, it takes five, 10 minutes to get into the game and then you have to get your second breath and then you can kick on from there.’ Manager Ronny Deila still has his injuries to contend with. Mikael Lustig, Adam Matthews and Charlie Mulgrew remain worries, but with a raft of new signings in the transfer window Brown says there are now no excuses for Celtic in Europe. ‘We are in the Europa League and it’s going to be a hard group as well. Salzburg on Thursday is going to be a really hard game. They’ve just signed someone for £11-£12million so that just shows you what a good squad they have.

The aim is to try to get out of the group.’ Brown appeared to disagree with suggestions the Europa League is closer to the current level of this Celtic team than the Champions League. ‘Each to their own opinion. I think we are good enough to play in the Champions League, we’ve shown that over the last two or three years when we’ve done really well in it, beat Barcelona and stuff like that.

"By . Paul Newman for the Daily Mail . Follow @@Paul_NewmanDM . Yorkshire captain Andrew Gale was controversially banned from receiving the biggest prize in county cricket yesterday and could be facing further punishment over the unsavoury clash with Ashwell Prince that ended his season. Yorkshire’s first title success for 13 years was tainted when their captain was stopped by the ECB from taking any part in the presentation ceremony after their thumping victory against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. The move, which followed Gale’s ban last week for verbally abusing Lancashire’s Prince, angered Yorkshire and their captain, who was said to be in tears in the dressing room while his stand-in Joe Root received the trophy. Yet the ECB, who came under fire for being too harsh on Gale, last night released a statement which made it clear that the player could be in further trouble over the exact nature of what he said to South African Prince. Andrew Gale (second from left) can only look on from the balcony alongside Director of Cricket Martyn Moxon (left) and coach Jason Gillespie (centre) as his Yorkshire team mates receive the trophy . Andrew Gale poses with the team after being banned from the presentation ceremony . Ashwell Prince bats for Lancashire during the LV Country Championship match between Lancashire and Yorkshire . It read: ‘After an incident in the match between Lancashire and Yorkshire the ECB made a complaint to the cricket discipline commission about the conduct of Andrew Gale. In these circumstances it was not felt appropriate for Mr Gale to be involved in the presentation.’ Gale, highly regarded for his leadership of Yorkshire, risked upsetting the ECB further by going on to the Trent Bridge outfield and lifting the trophy after the official presentation when he was urged to do so by his county’s support. He also looked emotional while carrying his daughter around the outfield. ‘We only found out he couldn’t lift the trophy last night,’ said Martyn Moxon, the Yorkshire director of cricket. ‘We can’t say anything else because there’s a legal process going on. It’s been hard for Andrew because he’s cherished the win and was looking forward to this moment.’ Gale, no stranger to disciplinary problems for dissent, was banned until September 27 after clashing with Prince. Sportsmail understands he made reference to the South African’s Kolpak status, which allows him to play for Lancashire as a non-overseas player.

It is the precise nature of what else Gale, a former England Lions captain, said that has led to the risk of him being in serious trouble and subsequently air-brushed out of the celebrations. In Gale’s absence Yorkshire needed just over an hour of the final day to take the remaining five Notts wickets, four of them falling to the evergreen Ryan Sidebottom, and clinch the title with a match to go. It is a notable triumph for a county in serious financial trouble until being rescued by chairman Colin Graves, who is also the deputy chairman of the ECB. Graves said yesterday Jason Gillespie, who was made coach when Yorkshire were relegated three years ago, was the catalyst for success.","Gale was banned from the presentation after Yorkshire won their first title in 13 years .

Cricket Australia physiotherapist Alex Kountouris has explained Clarke's injury is more serious than first hoped, and the 33-year-old batsman must therefore sit out the ODI leg of his team's final tour - to be played in the United Arab Emirates - before they host the World Cup next winter.

"By . Chris Pleasance for MailOnline . A deadly albino cobra that has been on the run in California since Monday after attacking a pet dog has finally been captured. Animal control officers found the snake hiding in a lumber pile in the backyard of a house, and snared it using a long grabber before packing it into a box. The animal, which is believed to have escaped from captivity, will now be taken to an animal shelter. Officials have caught the deadly albino monocled cobra that has been on the loose in California this week . Residents in the Ventura county neighbourhood had been told to be on the lookout after the venomous reptile escaped from captivity on Monday . Specially trained officers found the snake hiding in a woodpile in someone's backyard yesterday afternoon . 'We are overjoyed. We are glad that the public was not harmed,' Los Angeles County spokesman Brandon Dowling said after county animal control officers found the monocled cobra at 3pm. While specially trained officers managed to avoid being injured, the snake did try to attack. 'Once we grabbed it, it was afraid of us so it tried to strike at us,' animal control officer Fred Agoopi said. 'But we had the proper equipment and were able to handle it.' Cobra venom is a neurotoxin that can kill within an hour by paralysing the lungs. However, it wasn't immediately clear whether the albino snake — which apparently escaped from captivity — still had its venom glands, authorities said. The snake, which is several feet long, had been on the loose since at least Monday evening, when it reportedly bit a dog. However, the veterinarian who treated the animal said it appeared that the dog wasn't bitten but was hurt while trying to escape the snake, KNBC-TV reported. Using a long grabber the officers managed to get the snake into a box despite its attempts to bite them . The snake drew media attention earlier this week after it attacked a dog, though vets now think the canine may have injured itself trying to escape . Monocled cobras grow up to 4ft long and kill their prey using venom which paralyses the lungs. The monocled species are named for a ring on the back of their hood . Animal control officers said they found the snake by checking bushes and woodpiles during cooler mornings and evenings when the snake was more likely to be active. There were no more confirmed sightings of the snake until Thursday afternoon, when it was seen slithering in the same  area of Ventura county where it originally was spotted. Tanya Gray saw it crossing the road. She kept an eye on it but didn't approach. 'It wasn't my job to stop it or catch it,' she told KCAL-TV. 'It was just shocking because I didn't think I'd be the one to find it,' a youngster, Simona Lucchina, told KABC-TV. 'We were just driving by and my dad was showing me 'this is where they lost the snake' and all of the sudden we just saw it. It was a big coincidence.' Before the snake was captured, authorities had warned residents to keep an eye on their children, to keep pets indoors and to call 911 if they spotted it. The snake has now been taken to an animal shelter. Cobras are illegal to keep as pets, and so far nobody has come forward to claim it . A Twitter account set up pretending to be the snake tweeted this message after the animal was caught . But, residents of the neighbourhood, which is surrounded by snake-friendly brush and wilderness areas, weren't panicked by the intruder. 'I think we're all a bit concerned, but growing up in an area where there are rattlesnakes, it's probably not quite as scary,' said Susan McGrath, who lives near to where the dog was bitten. The monocled cobra is native to Southeast Asia, parts of India and China, and it can grow to 4 feet or more. Its name derives from a circle or ring on the back of its hood. Cobras are illegal to own in California except for educational and scientific purposes. The cobra apparently escaped from captivity, although authorities had not found the owner. Dowling said Thursday that investigators are following ""a few leads"" on where the snake came from.","Albino monocled cobra has been captured in backyard in California .

"By . Sam Peters . Sam Robson's international future is in doubt after he was overlooked for a central contract by England’s selectors despite opening the batting in all seven Tests this summer. The 25-year-old Middlesex batsman was the most notable omission on Thursday from a group of a dozen players handed lucrative 12-month ECB deals, which also included wicketkeeper Jos Buttler ahead of Matt Prior, who is recovering from achilles tendon surgery. Batsman Sam Robson hit 127 against Sri Lanka in June and played all of England's Tests this summer . Moeen Ali has impressed with bat and ball during 10 appearances for England this season . Central contracts: Moeen Ali, Jimmy Anderson, Gary Ballance, Ian Bell, Stuart Broad, Jos Buttler, Alastair Cook, Steven Finn, Chris Jordan, Joe Root, Ben Stokes, Chris Woakes. Incremental contracts: Ravi Bopara, Alex Hales, Eoin Morgan, Liam Plunkett, James Tredwell. With Kevin Pietersen sacked, Graeme Swann retired and Jonathan Trott still not considered ready for a recall after returning from last winter’s Ashes with a stress-related illness, there was the air of a new era surrounding the squad, with six players handed contracts for the first time. All-rounder Tim Bresnan is the other player not retained, with Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Chris Jordan, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes all joining Buttler in receiving their first full-time contracts. ‘The awarding of contracts enables the selectors and team management to plan for the next 12 months of international cricket,’ national selector James Whitaker said. ‘We have been hugely encouraged by the rapid development of a host of younger players in the last year, and this is reflected in six players being awarded 12-month central contracts for the first time.’ Gary Balance celebrates a Test century against India in July and has now been awarded a central contract . Yorkshire's Tim Bresnan ,here in bat, has not been retained on a central contract by the ECB . But it is Robson’s omission that will raise most eyebrows, leaving more questions over who will open alongside captain Alastair Cook during next summer’s Ashes. Australian-born Robson was given the summer to prove he should be the man entrusted with the second opener’s position. Nick Compton, Michael Carberry and Joe Root have also been tried alongside Cook but none has been able to make the position their own. Hopes were high Robson could fill the role when he scored 127 in his second Test against Sri Lanka in June, and 59 in the first India Test. His form has dipped alarmingly, though, and there is now a chance for Nottinghamshire opener Alex Hales to stake a claim for a Test place if he impresses during the World Cup this winter. Hales is one of five players given an incremental contract along with Ravi Bopara, Eoin Morgan, Liam Plunkett and James Tredwell. Jonathan Trott is rebuilding his form at Warwickshire but has not been retained on central contract by the ECB . .","Moeen Ali, Gary Ballance, Jos Buttler, Chris Jordan, Ben Stokes and Chris Woakes sign central contracts for the first time .

"By . Greg Stutchbury, Reuters . Former New Zealand cricketer Chris Cairns expects to be charged with perjury this month by British authorities and will travel to the UK to defend himself, the player said on Friday. The charges stem from a 2012 libel action he brought against Lalit Modi, the former boss of the Indian Premier League. Cairns said the Crown Prosecution Service had told him they intended to lay charges on Sept 25. He said he would cooperate with the authorities. Former Kiwis allrounder Chris Cairns was named in an ICC investigation into match fixing in December . Chris Cairns took over 200 Test wickets for New Zealand during a career that spanned 15 years . 'I have nothing to hide and I will do whatever it takes to once again prove my innocence,' he said. 'There will now be an opportunity to face my accusers in an open forum, with some rigour and proper process around that, so that I can clear my name once and for all. 'I hope that, through this forum, significant additional information will be flushed out that will help people to better assess the situation, as well as the character and motives of the parties involved. 'I wish this wasn't the situation - having been to Court before, I know what lies ahead and how gruelling it will be and how tough it is on my family - but I have nothing to hide and I will do whatever it takes to once again prove my innocence.' The strong all-rounder racked up over 8000 international runs during his career, just 50 short of 5000 in ODIs . A CPS spokeswoman said: 'We can confirm that we have authorised police to charge Chris Cairns with one count of perjury, which arises from a libel trial held in the UK in March 2012. 'We have also authorised police to charge Andrew Fitch-Holland with one count of perverting the course of justice, which arises from actions taken relating to the same trial. Both suspects will be formally charged by police in due course.' In 2012 Cairns won £90,000 libel damages after he sued Modi over an accusation of match-fixing made on Twitter in January 2010. In 2007 and 2008, Cairns captained the Chandigarh Lions in three competitions in the Indian Cricket League (ICL), which flourished briefly before the ascendancy of the IPL. The allegation made by Modi related to the second and third of these competitions, between March and April 2008 and October and November that year. Cairns, who notched up the rare double of 200 wickets and 3,000 runs in his 62 Tests, has reportedly confirmed that he had been notified by the CPS that it planned to bring charges against him. The charges related to a libel action brought against former IPL chief Lalit Modi . Chris Cairns now expects to be charged with perjury in Britain after being questioned by police in May . New Zealand Cricket issued a statement acknowledging the move by British authorities but declined to elaborate. 'These charges will now be tested in a British court of law and be subject to the normal processes of a criminal trial,' NZC said. Cairns flew to Britain in May to be interviewed by British police and the sport's anti-corruption officials in a separate investigation into allegations of matchfixing. The former all-rounder has consistently denied any wrongdoing. Former New Zealand batsman Lou Vincent was banned for life in July from all cricket after admitting to matchfixing in games in England.

"Red Bull team boss Christian Horner has defended outgoing champion Sebastian Vettel after another race in which he again played second fiddle to team-mate Daniel Ricciardo. After winning the title for the last four years, Vettel's reign is almost officially over as he trails championship leader Nico Rosberg by 132 points, with 175 available. For the most part it has been a season of struggle for Vettel, who has far from enjoyed the change in car following the switch at the start of this year to the current 1.6-litre V6 turbo-charged power units. Feeling the strain: Four-times world champion Sebastian Vettel has endured a troubled campaign . Coming through: Daniel Ricciardo passes his team-mate during the latter stages of Sunday's race . During Sunday's Italian Grand Prix, Ricciardo produced another fine drive to finish fifth following a shocking start, dropping several places after lining up ninth on the grid. Following his only pit stop, Ricciardo conjured a number of stunning overtaking moves on Ferrari's Kimi Raikkonen, the McLarens of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen, Force India's Sergio Perez, and finally Vettel. The 27-year-old German now faces the ignominious prospect of being beaten by a team-mate for the first time in his F1 career. Despite that, a protective Horner said: 'It's been a difficult year for Seb, but that's not been of his own making. 'Daniel has driven incredibly well, and all credit should be given to him for how he has driven this year. On the move: Vettel finished sixth behind Ricciardo in Monza. He is 60 points behind the Australian . 'Sebastian was happy with the car in qualifying, and in the early stages of the race, and his defensive driving was phenomenal. 'But his result wasn't down to a lack of pace, it was how their different strategies worked out.' Not for the first time this year, though, Horner was again full of praise for Ricciardo, who retains a small but unlikely hope of denying Rosberg and Lewis Hamilton the title. Winner of the previous two races in Hungary and Belgium, fifth was undeniably the best of the rest given the pace of the Mercedes-powered cars ahead, with the two works cars followed by Williams. 'I thought some of Daniel's moves were fantastic. He really drove with precision,' said Horner of Ricciardo, who trails Rosberg by 72 points in the standings. 'For somebody who had a question mark over their overtaking at the beginning of the year, he's right up there with the best. Does he continue to surprise me? Absolutely. Every race is a surprise. 'His start was shocking, which he's apologised for, but his recovery - particularly after the stop on to the prime (hard) tyre - was extremely impressive.'","Ricciardo finished fifth in Monza, one place ahead of his Red Bull team-mate .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy for the Daily Mail . Lewis Hamilton’s possible return to McLaren inched closer when his former boss Ron Dennis hinted he is considering re-signing his former protégé. McLaren are waiting to see how the fractious relationship between Hamilton and Nico Rosberg plays out at Mercedes, with the British driver on the short-list of three star drivers that also includes Fernando Alonso and Sebastian Vettel. ‘No-one could have predicted the tension inside Mercedes-Benz,’ said Dennis. ‘We can all imagine a range of scenarios that could see one of those drivers on the market by the end of the year.’ Return: Lewis Hamilton could be in line for a return to McLaren after a difficult spell with Mercedes . Dennis, who is famous for so-called ‘Ron-speak’ – his circumlocutory style of expression – added: ‘You are trying to understand what is available, and then you take a decision.’ It is understood that putative talks between McLaren representatives and Hamilton’s people have taken place. Eric Boullier, McLaren’s racing director, is even keener on signing Hamilton than Dennis, who fell out with the driver towards the end of his spell with the team. With Alonso, McLaren’s No 1 target, having last week reiterated his desire to stay at Ferrari, Hamilton is a strong contender to take the place of one of the two existing McLaren men, Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen. Pole: Hamilton edged out his Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg to take pole at the Italian Grand Prix . It would be a bold move by Hamilton to leave Mercedes, one of the best-funded teams in the sport and the fastest, but his disillusionment could be so fierce if we were to lose the title that he might well feel the urge to leave. There is also the possibility that Mercedes could dispense with him, to end the tense rivalry between Hamilton and Rosberg. Even though Mercedes have tried to manage their warring drivers, the team boss Toto Wolff warned this week that they could suspend or sack either of them if there was any repeat of their crash at the last race in Spa a fortnight ago. ‘We would have to take decisions and take the consequences of having a different line-up,’ he said. ‘If we are not able to manage the two of them following the Mercedes-Benz spirit then we need to admit that.’ Feud: The relationship between Mercedes drivers Hamilton and Rosberg has completely broken down .","Lewis Hamilton and Nico Rosberg Mercedes relationship  has broken down .

The figure of Smokin’ Joe poised in the split second after landing the booming left with which he floored Muhammad Ali on his way to winning the Fight Of The Century stands nine-feet tall in the studio of sculptor Stephen Layne. It is now beginning the five-month bronzing procedure prior to an unveiling in Frazier’s home city of Philadelphia next April. VIDEO: Scroll down to watch Joe Frazier statue being sculpted ahead of its unveiling . Mirror: A statue of Joe Frazier, showing him throwing a left hook against Muhammad Ali, is almost complete . A campaign for the real former world heavyweight champion to be thus immortalised followed the erection in Philadelphia of a statue of celluloid boxer Sylvester Stallone. Civil Rights leader Reverend Jesse Jackson said: ‘Tell them Rocky was fictitious. Joe was reality.’ Several years of fund-raising and political manoeuvring later, that anomaly is about to be corrected. Project: Sculptor Stephen Layne expects the Frazier statue to be ready in April and it will stand in Philadelphia . The process was tragically interrupted when the original sculptor died suddenly, Layne, the runner-up in that selection process, took over, admitting that he feels ‘the artistic pressure to create the best piece I can put out there.’ So powerful and commanding is the result that one of Frazier’s daughters was moved to weep when invited to see that statue. No doubt there will be more tears for the late Smokin’ Joe when he takes his eternal place on the site of the old Spectrum arena which he christened with his 1967 victory over Tony Doyle.","A statue of Joe Frazier has been a long time coming .

"By . Chris Foy for the Daily Mail . Follow @@FoyChris . Wasps are increasingly optimistic they will be able to keep hold of their ‘crown jewel’, England lock Joe Launchbury, in light of their fine victory over champions Northampton. The 23-year-old is out of contract at the end of the season and other clubs are permitted to officially approach him from January 1, if he has not agreed a new deal with his current employers by then. Saracens are thought to be monitoring the situation and Wasps will be wary of losing another leading light to their London rivals, who lured Billy Vunipola away last year. Joe Launchbury of Wasps in action during the Aviva Premiership match against Northampton Saints . Wasps Director of Rugby Dai Young looks on at Adams Park on Sunday afternoon . Such is Launchbury’s rising status in the game, there is sure to be a transfer-market scramble for his services if he becomes available, but Wasps director of rugby Dai Young is hopeful. ‘I am very confident that he will stay,’ said the Welshman. ‘It will be sorted, one way or the other, in the next couple of months. ‘He is the crown jewel and it would be a massive loss for us if we lost Joe. If we did, we would have to move on, like we did with Billy. A lot of people thought it was the end of the world when we lost Billy but we unearthed Nathan Hughes.We would be mega, mega disappointed if Joe did leave, but we will do everything in our power to keep hold of him. I am confident that Joe will stay, but if it gets to Christmas, I guess that is when you start to feel that things may not be going your way.’ Sunday’s result in High Wycombe, where Wasps stunned the Saints to win 20-16, could prove a factor in helping them to keep hold of Launchbury. He has asked for assurances about the stability and ambition of the club, and although the search for a permanent ground goes on, the financial outlook is more settled and the team are reviving. ‘Joe is not far off world-class now and no world-class second row wants to be involved in relegation fights every year,’ said Young. ‘No world-class second row wants to be involved in the lower tiers of competition. No world-class second row wants to worry about what squad the club has got, or whether it is going to be here in six months.’ Joe Launchbury of Wasps runs at Northampton and England flanker Tom Wood . Billy Vunipola of Saracens is tackled by Joe Gray of Harlequins on Friday night . Asked if he was concerned about the danger of lightning striking twice — after Vunipola appeared keen to stay at Wasps, but then chose to join his brother Mako at Saracens — Young added: ‘With Billy, the situation was slightly different. Off the field, the club had a lot of difficulties and he could see the unstable position we were in. ‘The external factors were huge with that — the family were pulling Billy towards Saracens. I don’t really see that being a factor with Launchers. Knowing Joe as I do, I don’t think he’ll just go to the highest bidder — that isn’t in his nature. He will be more worried about what is right for his rugby.’ Premiership clubs are poised to ratify an increase in the salary cap on Wednesday — to a maximum of £5.5million. In addition, each club will be allowed to recruit a second ‘excluded’ player — whose salary is not counted within the cap. They must be new to the league next season, or have not played in the competition for at least 12 months. This opens the door for clubs to sign the likes of Steffon Armitage or Toby Flood from France. Bath received good news on Monday as a scan revealed their England wing, Anthony Watson, did not sustain significant ankle damage in the win over London Welsh, as first feared. Instead, he has a minor foot issue, but may even be fit in time to face Leicester at The Rec on Saturday.

Amir Khan vows not to bite that hand that feeds him if Floyd Mayweather delivers on his promise of a place in the opposite corner for one of his mega-million-dollar super fights next year. Britain’s would-be successor to the throne of the mythical dominion of the greatest pound-for-pound fighter in the world watched in the same dismay and disgust as the rest of us as Marcos Maidana sank his teeth into the Chinese puzzle of a genius for whom he could find no solution. On the night the spectre of Luis Suarez moved from the World Cup playing field to the Las Vegas Strip, Khan made no bones about what the punishment should be for any sportsman who resorts to such cannibal desperation. Floyd Mayweather (right) confronts Marcos Maidana (left) about the alleged bite . Floyd Mayweather (right) was a clear and deserved winner over the Argentine Marcos Maidana (left) Floyd Mayweather (centre) celebrates a unanimous points victory over Marcos Maidana in Las Vegas . He said: ‘When you do that you should never be allowed in the boxing ring again, because you’re risking someone’s life.’ Khan held out his clenched fists and said: ‘These are our tools and we need them (to survive).’ By distasteful – in every sense - irony, Khan was sitting next to the villain and the victim of the ring’s most infamous biting incident. When Mike Tyson gnawed a chunk out of Evander Holyfield’s ear he was pilloried for defacing not only his heavyweight nemesis but the hard old game itself - and Khan knows that boxing will be damaged by Maidana’s aberration. He says: ‘It shames the sport. Getting frustrated can happen to anyone but this is not the way to deal with it. I’m mentally strong and I would never do anything like that. It’s just wrong. It is important to respect your sport and each other.’ It is also gruesome ingratitude for being given the chance to make a small fortune. Maidana (centre) is $5 million better off after his two fights with Floyd Mayweather . Floyd Mayweather was shaken by a blow to his head late in the third round . While others more deserving – notably Khan and Manny Pacquiao – are kept interminably waiting, Maidana has been granted two of these Maweather opportunities for wealth and fame within four months. Each time he has discovered that being the Raging Bull from the Argentine pampas is not enough to unseat he who is both maestro of self defence and magical conjuror of the counter-attack. Despite being some five million dollars better off after attending this pair of master classes, Maidana is in denial. ‘No, no,’ he protested, despite being shown he video of him chomping away. ‘I didn’t bite him.’ But it was also reminiscent of Suarez, another South American with cannibal tendencies as he had added: ‘Maybe he put his glove in mouth. Perhaps he thinks I’m a dog.’ Mayweather had no doubts about what was done to his left hand in the eighth round at the MGM Grand Garden Arena: ‘At first I didn’t know what had happened. Then I realised that he bit me. Three of my fingers went numb. One of them busted open where he bit me through the glove. I couldn’t feel those fingers for the rest of the fight and could only use the other hand properly.’ VIDEO: Floyd Mayweather claims that Marcos Maidana 'bit through three of my fingers.' Referee Kenny Bayless found for Mayweather, issuing dire warnings to the Maidana corner before he allowed the fight to continue. Bayless also deducted a point from Maidana for twice throwing Mayweather to the canvas in a manner more befitting a wrestling match. Even so Maidana took issue with the three other officials, saying: ‘I won the fight but if the judges want to give it to the man who ran away then good luck to them.’ For what it’s worth, my card concurred with the two who scored Mayweather the winner by 116 points to 111. The other made it 115-12. It may even be that we all short-changed an artist who confounded those who feared that his legs were aging and his reflexes slowing. Amir Khan (left) watched the fight with Mike Tyson (right) in Las Vegas on Saturday night . Muhammad Ali would have been proud of some of his footwork, while his elusive head and body movement kept Maidana missing like a drunk in a bar brawl. Khan did not see it that way, saying: ‘Floyd is looking older and he is slowing down. I don’t want just to fight him for the money, I want to beat him. My speed would do for him now.’ Mayweather’s Saturday night victory keeps alive the hope of Khan being given the chance to go for a place in history as the first to beat the Money man, who said; ‘He’s competitive and a good fighter so let’s see if it can happen.’ Even more importantly in the eyes of the wider world, it revives the possibility of Mayweather finally meeting Manny Pacquiao in a long-awaited $300 million fight of the century. Mayweather said: ‘I’ll talk to my team about what the future holds and if a Pacquiao fight can be done let’s make it happen.’ Given his past reluctance to so much as mention the PacMan by name, this is cause for optimism that the obstacles dividing promoters and television companies can be overcome. Quite when that might be is unclear. The arduous preparations for fights of this magnitude take their toll of a 37-year-old and Mayweather hinted that he may pass on his next proposed date – next May – and give his body a full year to recover. ‘There’s no rush, is there?’ he asked his Showtime television paymasters. Not for himself economically as he prepares to pocket at least $32 million from this fourth instalment of a six-fight contract with that pay-per-view network worth a minimum of $250 million in total. Mayweather’s independence as well as Mexico’s was celebrated this holiday weekend by the 47th victory of his illustrious, still undefeated career.

Floyd Mayweather (right) looks incredulously at Marcos Maidana has he raises his arms at the end of the fight . Marcos Maidana (right) roughs Floyd Mayweather (left) up by rubbing his arm in the American's face . It was achieved by bewildering Maidana and then punishing him for those wild misses with a whole variety of laser-accurate punches – the more debilitating of them to the body - which became more wounding as the 12 rounds unfolded. So bemused was the challenger for all those welterweight and light-middleweight belts which were on the line that twice at the end of rounds Maidana wandered off towards the wrong corner. On the second occasion Mayweather turned back to redirect him, like a traffic cop. That was a first for me in all these years covering boxers and the champion was amused: ‘Boxing’s a hard business but it’s important to keep a sense of humour.’ The joke was lost on Maidana. But then this is not just sport’s year of the biter……..but of the biter well and truly bit.

"By . Ryan Kisiel For Daily Mail . England's new rugby kit was embroiled in more controversy on Monday over claims officials had decided to downplay its Victoria Cross design. The VC – the highest award for bravery a member of the British or Commonwealth Armed Forces can receive – had been used for ‘inspiration’ on the new jerseys. A pattern of the medal’s shape is on the ‘ball deadening’ rubber grips on both the home white and red change strips. England players wear the new England rugby home kit, which has caused controversy . Geoff Parling wearing the new England home kit, a uniform now mired in controversy . However The Times claimed that previous press releases had mentioned the medal design only for it to be omitted altogether at the last minute from Monday’s launch. It alleged that both the shirt manufacturers Canterbury and the Rugby Football Union had a last minute change of heart over the appropriateness. Some fears that it was crass to associate bravery in the rugby world with the VC that is awarded for ‘most conspicuous bravery, or some daring or pre-eminent act of valour or self-sacrifice’. England head coach Stuart Lancaster has drawn heavily on England’s rich rugby history and used previous military examples to inspire players. The former Leeds boss created the Arthur Harrison Award, where England coaches select a winner after every match for the player producing the best defensive performance. Harrison is England’s only rugby international to be awarded the Victoria Cross, bestowed posthumously after he lost his life in the Belgian Zeebrugge raid of April 1918 in the First World War. It is the latest embarrassment for the RFU, which was forced to defend its new kit after admitting it will be changed in 10 months in time for the sport’s world cup. The latest replica shirts, which cost £91, will be used by the national team in the forthcoming Autumn internationals and next year’s Six Nations tournament. But Rugby Football Union sources yesterday confirmed that another shirt would go on sale next July in time for the Rugby World Cup, which is being held in England. Under the tournament’s rules, all teams must remove sponsorship logos and attach a Rugby World Cup 2015 badge while taking part. Every country taking part will therefore have to change their strips by September. It means the England rugby team will only wear the Test shirt for around 12 matches before switching again. The manufacturers brought out three other Pro and Classic official jerseys at £56 each that are also replicas, but not made to the same standards as the Test strips the players wear. The England rose badge has moved from the left, pictured, to the centre of their shirts . The new shirt’s design has not changed much from the previous one launched last September, apart from moving the English Rose badge from the left to the centre. Suppliers Canterbury claim the Test jersey costs more because it is made from more flexible polyester and elastane fibres, has increased strength around the arms to prevent ripping and a small loop collar. It also has a ‘ball deadening’ rubber grip chest panels that allegedly help players keep hold of the ball. However, some English and Welsh fans have questioned the all red change strip – colours usually worn by Wales. The row has heightened after both England and Wales will play each other in next year’s tournament along with Australia in what has been dubbed the Group of Death. The RFU and Canterbury said in a joint statement: ‘We are extremely pleased with our new kits and have worked in close collaboration during the design process. We had three key focus areas this season: the rose, which for the first time ever has moved to the centre of the shirt; the red colour for the alternate kit and the fact that the team would wear this against Samoa. ‘In addition the grip detail takes inspiration from the Victoria Cross and this is something that England Rugby and Canterbury are proud of.’","The Victoria Cross had been used for ‘inspiration’ on the new jerseys .

"By . Andrew Levy For Daily Mail . This is the moment a great-grandfather came face-to-face with three armed raiders at his home – and fought them off. Smartly dressed after a night out, Andrew Adamson, 59, had just returned home with his wife Liz, 58, when he discovered their front door had been forced open. Moments later, one of the thugs emerged and battered him with a 2ft crowbar, swinging so hard ‘sparks were flying off it when he hit the wall’, followed by his accomplices. Scroll down for video . Andrew Adamson, 59, returned home to find three burglars inside his house and bravely fought them off . The three masked intruders forced entry to his property in Kettering, Northamptonshire, in December 2010 . But the raiders were not counting on Mr Adamson’s remarkable pluck. Instead of backing down, the businessman tackled the gang head-on, eventually forcing them to retreat. So bold were his actions that later, in court, even one of his own attackers praised Mr Adamson’s courage. But the clock and watch repairer, who is 5ft 8in tall and weighs 19 stone, insisted: ‘I was not going to stand by and let them ransack my house – I did what any good husband would do. ‘I wanted to protect my home and my wife. They say an Englishman’s home is his castle but I acted on instinct.’ The CCTV footage from the entrance to the house in Kettering, Northamptonshire – which also shows the thugs breaking in before the couple arrive – led to one being identified and handed a lengthy jail term. Another has been jailed after he was arrested for a separate offence and DNA was matched to a balaclava Mr Adamson snatched off him in the fight. The gang got away with £400 cash and the briefcase Mr Adamson had been carrying. Mr Adamson, who has three children, four grandchildren and a great-grandchild, told of the moment he arrived home. He said: ‘The next thing we know the chap comes out with the iron bar. Sparks were flying off it when he hit the wall, he was really trying to whack me. I was trying to force him off. ‘I followed them out onto the street and I got hold of the other fella but the taller assailant came back for him and pulled a razor out, so I decided that was the time to let go. Mr Adamson returned home from a social event dressed in his dinner suit and carrying a briefcase when he noticed the door of his home had been forced open. CCTV footage captured the struggle which followed . The father-of-three didn't let the fact the intruders were armed with crowbars stop him from trying to fight them . At one point one of the intruders even pulled out a razor blade, but Mr Adamson fought them until they ran off . Mr Adamson tried to protect himself from the crowbar wielding intruders (left) before fighting them off (right) Liz Adamson (left) was also caught up in the incident but fled to get help when she realised they were being attacked. She had been the first to enter the property but it was her husband who defended them from danger . Brave Mr Adamson managed to take on all three of the intruders one-by-one until they fled the property . ‘I got hit several times over the side of the head and had to have seven stitches. I was bleeding like a stuck pig. ‘If my wife had been on her own that night I dread to think what would have happened.’ The 87-second clip from December 18, 2010, enabled police to identify Duncan Berry, from Kettering, now 23. He admitted aggravated burglary at Northampton Crown Court and was sentenced to four-and-a-half years in 2011. This year a DNA check linked David Jarvie, 53, to a balaclava at Mr Adamson’s home. Jarvie, also of Kettering, admitted aggravated burglary and actual bodily harm and was jailed for five-and-a-half years on August 28. Jarvie’s defence barrister William Fanshaw, told the court that even his client was amazed at Mr Adamson’s courage: ‘He says himself that the victim was a very brave man to stand up to a whole group of men, some of whom were armed.’ Mrs Adamson, who raced to get help during the raid, said: ‘I didn’t find out until I watched the CCTV what Andy had done. I am very proud of him.’ One neighbour, who asked not to be named, said: ‘He’s a very polite man – not the sort you expect to take on three yobs. What he did was amazing.’ Grandfather-of-four and father-of-three Mr Adamson said: 'I was not just going to let them stand by and ransack my house - I did what any good husband would do. I wanted to protect my home and protect my wife' The masked men forced their way into the Adamson's house in Kettering, Northamptonshire, before the ruckus .","Andrew Adamson, 59, returned home to find three burglars inside his house .

School of Hard Knocks aims to help young men develop skills so that they can eventually find employment . England head coach Stuart Lancaster (centre) speaks to some of the recruits in School of Hard Knocks . Sky Sports rugby pundits Scott Quinnell and Will Greenwood once again feature heavily - as forwards and backs coach respectively - and they helped to train the players at Moseley RFC. And, as former British and Irish Lions No 8 Quinnell explains, ‘rugby is less than 40 per cent’ of what the show is all about - the main thing is that it introduces people to a new way of life and aids their job prospects. The 52-cap Welshman said: ‘The School of Hard Knocks is massively important. These guys have never picked up a rugby ball in their lives so they don’t know how to throw it, how to catch it, to throw it backwards – you have to start from scratch and they need to learn very, very quickly. ‘But it is the other things which are more important than the rugby skills.

When you walk into a rugby club, whether you’re eight or 80, a brickie or a doctor, you will still be able to have a conversation with somebody. ‘We try to show these lads the positives in their lives and give them something to look forward to. To get up in the morning. To be able to think of other people rather than just in your own little world because a problem shared is a problem half. A group of friends from a rugby team can help you. ‘It’s about being honest with people and having people who can help. Wherever we do the School of Hard Knocks - these are people who genuinely want help. They want an opportunity in life and that’s the biggest thing. ‘Myself, Will and the rest want to help them in life.

He wasn’t the type of guy who stood on the sideline and just smiled. He really got stuck in and helped out. ‘Everyone had a huge amount of respect for him - the guys and the coaches.

"By . Pa Reporter . Newcastle centre Juan Pablo Socino hit the post with a late conversion attempt as the Falcons were narrowly beaten 20-18 by London Irish in a thriller on the new synthetic pitch at Kingston Park. Socino was just unable to snatch a draw for the battling home side, who were ultimately sunk by a controversial Andrew Fenby try midway through the second half. A break up the left touchline saw back rower Blair Cowan feed the ball inside for Fenby to score to a cacophony of boos from the crowd as it looked a forward pass. Newcastle's Juan Pablo Socino reacts after missing a key conversion attempt in their loss to London Irish . Juan Pablo Socino hit the post as he missed a late conversion from out wide that could have snatched a draw . Referee Andrew Small gave the score but then halted Shane Geraghty as he was lining up the conversion to see a replay on the big screen and eventually decided the try was good. Geraghty, who ran the game, kicked the extras and at 20-10 London Irish looked virtually home and dry, although a late penalty from Socino followed by a try from Sinoti Sinoti - from which Socino hit the post with his conversion - had the crowd on the edge of their seats. It meant a losing bonus point for Newcastle, but the Falcons side have now gone 18 Premiership games without a win - their last victory in the league coming against London Irish last October. Although it was close in the end, Irish deserved their win. They had the edge at the set piece, especially the scrummage, and were far superior behind against a Falcons side lacking any sort of cutting edge - two of Newcastle’s tries coming from line-out catch and drives. Referee Andrew Small asks for a TV reply from the ground before awarding Newcastle's second try . Josh Furno carries the ball in the move that led to the Falcons' first try against London Irish . Newcastle were 6-5 down at half-time to two Geraghty penalties while Phil Godman’s penalty into the corner set up the line-out drive for Italian cap Josh Furno to score on his home debut in the 10th minute. Socino missed the conversion and London Irish dominated much of the remainder of the half with Geraghty kicking a penalty after Adam Powell intercepted and was then caught and pinged for holding on, before the former England international landed a 45-metre shot in first-half stoppage-time. Geraghty was also the spark for Irish’s first try, his weaving run linking up with Chris Noakes and Fergus Mulchrone had an easy run-in in the 45th minute. Newcastle Falcons run out onto their new artificial pitch at Kingston Park before narrowly losing to Irish . The clash with London Irish was the first Aviva Premiership match on the new surface . Geraghty’s conversion put Irish 13-5 up and when Tom Court was sin binned for a dangerous tackle on Ruki Tipuna, Socino missed another sitter when Newcastle badly needed three points. Newcastle then spurned another kick at goal to go for the corner and they were back in the game when Scott Wilson was driven over for the try to make it 13-10. Then came that controversial Fenby try converted by Geraghty in then 65th minute which should have put the game beyond Newcastle’s reach. But Socino’s 70th-minute penalty gave Newcastle a glimmer of hope which Sinoti fanned into a flame when he crashed over in the corner in stoppage time to make it 20-18, although they could not snatch the draw as Socino’s conversion attempt from wide out hit the post.","Juan Pablo Socino could have salvaged a draw with a late conversion .

"By . Ian Ladybourn, Press Association . Wigan overturned an 18-4 half-time deficit to gain a precious victory in an epic repeat of last October's Grand Final to ensure a top-three finish in the First Utility Super League. In a classic final match of the regular season for both clubs, six of the eight tries were scored by wingers, with England's Josh Charnley providing the highlight with an 80-metre interception for the reigning champions. Warrington went into the match with a proud record at the DW Stadium, where they had not lost since 2009, and they looked sure to extend their unbeaten run when they ran in three converted tries in a 14-minute burst just before half-time.

Wigan overturned an 18-4 half-time deficit to gain a precious victory against Warrington . But the Warriors were inspired by coach Shaun Wane's interval pep talk as they went on to turn the game on its head in a thrilling second half to complete the league double over their rivals. Wolves winger Joel Monaghan, Super League's leading tryscorer, showed his danger as early as the third minute when the visitors pounced on a handling error by Wigan full-back Matty Bowen and it took a last-ditch tackle by youngster Joe Burgess to keep him out. Burgess, whose duel with Monaghan provided one of a series of highlights, demonstrated superb finishing four minutes later, taking Sean O'Loughlin's cut-out pass to cross at the corner to give the Warriors the early lead. The youngster went close again shortly afterwards following a break by Charnley from inside his own half and then pulled off another save to deny Monaghan. Warrington Wolves' Trent Waterhouse is tackled during the Super League match on Thursday night . Wigan ought to have been further ahead after dominating the opening quarter but the visitors persevered and struck a purple patch to seize control of the game. Monaghan took Chris Bridge's pass to finish off a slick handling move for his first try on 26 minutes and eight minutes later Bridge carved out one for scrum-half Richie Myler. Myler then hoisted a kick for Monaghan to touch down with inches to spare for his 28th try of the campaign and Stefan Ratchford's third conversion made it 18-4 at the break. Wane's harsh words at the interval clearly did the trick for the champions, who were more like their old selves at the start of the season half. Centre Dan Sarginson was brought down just short of the line before getting Burgess over for his second try and on 52 minutes Charnley grabbed his first try, hacking the ball ahead and winning the race to get the final touch. Warrington Wolves' Trent Waterhouse is tackled by Wigan Warriors' Michael McIlorum . With Matty Smith unable to add any of the conversions, Wigan still trailed by six points and Ratchford made it 20-12 with a 58th-minute penalty awarded for a shoulder charge by Joel Tomkins on O'Brien. Both sides were down to 12 men by then after Paul Wood (Warrington) and Eddy Pettybourne (Wigan) were sin-binned for trading punches, with Wood clearly the aggressor, and it was the Warriors who made the most of the extra space. Charnley swooped on Michael Monaghan's sloppy pass to race 80 metres for an opportunist try on 62 minutes and three minutes later stand-off Blake Green forced his way over from close range to restore his side's lead. Smith added both goals to make it 24-20 and Warrington's hopes sunk further when the dangerous Bridge hobbled off. Wigan thought they had scored again when centre Anthony Gelling re-gathered his own kick to touch down but the try was disallowed by video referee Richard Silverwood for obstruction and that set up a tense finale, with the Warriors hanging on at the end.

"By . James Candy . It's a long way to the Guinness Pro12 play-offs but Gregor Townsend will know his Glasgow Warriors are already producing title-winning performances after Niko Matawalu came off the bench to stun Cardiff with two killer tries. Any thoughts that their opening-day success against defending champions Leinster was a flash in the pan were quickly dispelled with this impressive victory over one of the summer’s busiest teams. Cardiff Blues had bucked the trend among Welsh regions by recruiting, and recruiting big, especially in the capture of British Lions anchor Adam Jones, All Black lock Jarrad Hoeata and Italy No8 Monoa Vosowai. Niko Matawalu dives past the tackle of Cardiff's Rhys Patchell to score his first try of the day . Cardiff Blues: A Thomas; A Cuthbert, C Allen (R Smith 62), G Evans, D Fish; R Patchell (G Davies 70), L Jones (L Williams 54); S Hobbs (T Filise 70), M Rees (capt, K Dacey 65), A Jones (S Andrews 70), J Hoeata (M Cook 55), F Paulo, J Turnbull (J Navidi 65), S Warburton, M Vosawai. Pens – R Patchell (4) Glasgow: P Murchie; T Seymour, M Bennett (D Weir 54), A Dunbar, S Lamont; P Horne (D Van de Merwe 65), H Pyrgos (N Matawalu 54); A Allan (G Reid 55), P MacArthur (F Brown 40), R de Klerk (J Yanuyanutawa 40), T Swinson, J Gray (L Nakarawa 68), R Harley, C Fusaro (J Eddie 75), J Strauss (capt). Tries – S Lamont, Matawalu (2). Cons – H Pyrgos, D Weir (2). Pens – H Pyrgos (2), D Wier (2). Referee: John Lacey (Ireland) All three were on show here at the Arms Park but even their considerable presence could not disrupt the Warriors’ bright start to the season. A yellow card for Gordon Reid failed to halt the visitors’ momentum as the finishing prowess of Matawalu and Sean Lamont proved decisive. Matawalu scored twice as a second-half replacement after Lamont had put Glasgow on course for an opportunist win that sends them up to second place. Henry Pyrgos and Duncan Weir added a brace of penalties apiece to cancel out Rhys Patchell’s four converted efforts for the Blues. And Townsend will have been equally satisfied by the fact his men kept the likes of Alex Cuthbert at bay. ‘We knew this would be a tough game so we’re delighted at this win,’ said the head coach. ‘We showed a lot of character at a time when Cardiff were getting the momentum in the second-half when we were down to 14 men but we really stepped it up. ‘You could see that again when four of our players chased back after a Blues interception, even though the referee brought it back for an earlier penalty. ‘Our bench made a big impact to help us get the two tries and that really got us in a comfortable position. ‘Jerry Yanuyanutawa really stuck to his task after coming off the bench having only recently converted to the tight-head side of the scrum. ‘We were more accurate than them, there wasn’t a scrum during the whole time we had a man in the sin-bin. ‘We’d love to be back in the play-offs, but we’re only two games in with 20 to go and we know how hard it is to get a home semi-final. ‘The difference was that we took our opportunities from their mistakes whereas they didn’t.’ The Warriors had been sent an early warning by Blues fly-half Patchell. The 22-year-old, fresh from notching up 21 points against Zebre, fly-hacked his own chip towards Dan Fish deep in Glasgow territory but Tommy Seymour was on hand with a last-ditch tackle. However, Glasgow’s forwards were hasty at a maul and Patchell kicked the opening points. Pyrgos equalised with his opening effort and traded penalties again with Patchell after Wales hooker Matthew Rees was twice penalised. The artificial surface at the Arms Park, coupled with ideal conditions for running rugby, made for an end-to-end spectacle. Rhys Patchell can't stop Sean Lamont running in for his try after the ball was stripped from Cory Allen . But last season’s beaten finalists showed the opportunism that saw them overcome Leinster last weekend to claim the first try. Lamont combined strength and speed to mark his return to the starting team with a try. The Scotland wing robbed Cory Allen of possession. That was no mean feat in itself given the powerful young centre has already been capped by Warren Gatland. Yet Lamont is no lightweight either and showed a clean pair of heels as he thundered down the left-hand touchline, out-pacing the covering defence, to hand the Warriors a 13-6 lead at half-time. Townsend brought front-rowers Fraser Brown and Yanuyanutawa on for the second half in an attempt to stifle the driving prowess of 100-cap Jones. Yet even that failed to bolt the doors as the Cardiff scrum shunted Glasgow’s forwards off the ball to win a penalty, five metres inside their own territory, that Patchell kicked. The tide appeared to be turning inextricably in the hosts’ favour when replacement hooker Reid was binned, just moments after taking the field, as Glasgow’s scrum threatened to implode under pressure. But Townsend’s men mustered their spirits and managed to round the wagons and survive the 10-minute spell without further punishment. It was the display of potential champions and proved a turning point here in Cardiff. Townsend’s forward replacements had precious little impact but the introduction of Matawalu and Weir on 54 minutes was to prove decisive. Matawalu, with his first touch, pounced upon a loose pass intended for Fish and raced into the corner. It was against the run of play but highlighted the gulf between the team’s finishing abilities. Weir converted and added a further penalty to stretch Glasgow’s lead to 11 points with just 17 minutes remaining. That lead impacted on Cardiff whose discipline deserted them amid the pressure of chasing the game. They conceded more penalties than any other team in the opening round of the season and that told once more five minutes later. It was only good news for Weir. But it was his half-back partner Matawalu who delivered the knock-out blow on 70 minutes. DTH Van de Merwe broke clear of the Cardiff defence on the left wing and found the 19-cap international in space and he saw off the scrambling Blues defence to wrap the game up. Weir again converted. The hosts continued to bully the Warriors at the set-piece for the final 10 minutes, but Townsend’s men managed to outfox the Blues to maintain their 100 percent start to the campaign.","Fijian star scores two tries off the bench to secure win .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Castleford ensured the battle for the League Leaders' Shield will go down to the final round of fixtures after beating Wakefield 26-22 in a rousing derby at the Mend-a-Hose Jungle. The Tigers' hard-fought victory means they will finish top of the table for the first time in the club's history if current leaders St Helens lose at Huddersfield and they beat Catalan Dragons in Perpignan next weekend. Delight: Castleford have kept themselves in contention for the League Leaders Shield with their Derby win . Castleford could do no wrong for the first half-hour as they stormed into a 22-0 lead but veteran forward Ali Lauitiiti inspired a remarkable fightback for the visitors. Three-quarters Lee Gilmour and Richard Owen, both playing on loan from Castleford, scored tries against their parent club to help set up a tense finish before the Tigers were able to finally complete a third win of the season over their near neighbours. Wakefield created the first scoring opportunity when full-back Paul Sykes burst clear with stand-off Pita Godinet on his inside but the final pass went astray and the Tigers proceeded to give them a lesson in finishing. Sykes brought second rower Oliver Holmes short of the line but the Wildcats could not regroup in time to prevent full-back Luke Dorn slicing through for the opening in the next play. Loose forward Nathan Massey was then held up over the line before left winger James Clare produced two excellent finishes to score two tries in 15 minutes. Exciting hooker Daryl Clark was the provider on both occasions, the first from a trademark surge following a quickly taken re-start and the second with a superb cut-out pass. Close Competition: St Helens still remain the favourites and have a firm grip on the lead ahead of Castleford . Clare, deputising for injured Australian Justin Carney, took both his chances magnificently while right winger Kirk Dixon also came up with a devastating finish on 32 minutes, taking Clark's pass to go round Chris Riley for his side's fourth try. Marc Sneyd's third goal made it 22-0 but the Tigers became over-confident and when they knocked on from the first tackle on their own 20-metre line they were punished, with Lauitiiti sending Gilmour over for Wakefield's first try. Sykes added the conversion, to register the 500th goal of his career, and Wakefield scored again three minutes before half-time when Dixon fumbled Tim Smith's high kick to gift a try to Riley. Wakefield had the momentum at that stage and centre Reece Lyne touched down two minutes into the second half only to discover he had put a foot in touch and Castleford managed to regain control of the game. However, the action continued as both sets of players produced a series of crunching hits which provided great entertainment for the bumper derby crowd of 9,182. Castleford prop Garreth Carvell had to be placed on a stretcher after being flattened by a tackle from Wakefield substitute Chris Annakin as both teams demonstrated full commitment to the end. When Riley failed to clear the danger caused by Sneyd's kick and centre Jake Webster swooped for Castleford's fifth try on 67 minutes, the game looked to be over as a contest. However, the Wildcats set up a dramatic finale by scoring two tries in the last 10 minutes, both converted by Sykes and the home side were hanging on at the end. Australian prop Scott Anderson pounced on a loose ball to register the first try of his career and Owen dived over at the corner with seven minutes remaining.","Castleford's win means the League Leaders shield battle goes down to the final day .

"By . Pa Reporter . Catalan Dragons beat Hull KR 32-14 for just their fourth away victory of the season and ended Rovers play-off hopes in the process. Catalan deserved the win with a solid performance against a Rovers side that ran out of steam as the went on. Their top-eight hopes were all but over after a performance against Hull last week that coach Chris Chester described as 'embarrassing', and this loss just confirmed the inevitable. Rovers actually opened the scoring in the ninth minute after forcing a repeat set close to the visitors try line and a penalty for Craig Hall's quick hands meant Liam Salter had the space to dive over in the left hand corner. Timely hat-trick: Catalan Dragons' Michael Oldfield crosses for one of his three tries as they beat Hull KR . Salter was a late call-up for Kris Welham whose wife went into labour on the morning of the game. Travis Burns converted for a 6-0 lead that the home side deserved are their positive opening. The lead lasted five minutes. Catalan broke down their right-hand side with Elliott Whitehead and Ben Pomeroy combining to send Michael Oldfield away for the Dragons' first try. Thomas Bosc added the extras from in front of the posts to make it 6-6 after 15 minutes. The Dragons, whose only away wins this season came against already relegated London and Bradford, took the lead in the 28th minute. From a scrum 20 metres from their own line, they went down the blindside where Whitehead offloaded to Oldfield who scored from 60 metres, shrugging off a poor attempted tackle by the back tracking Greg Eden. Bosc converted for a 12-6 lead. Rovers, playing their last home game of the season and with plenty of wrongs to right after their 28-0 derby defeat last time out, rallied and scored seven minutes before half-time. Macauley Hallett, making his Rovers debut, marked his big day with a try. Eden's long pass left Hallett with plenty to do, but he remained composed to spin his way over the line at full stretch. Burns missed the conversion to leave Rovers trailing 12-10 with five minutes of the first half remaining. Rovers started the second half by kicking the ball beyond the in-goal area to give Catalan the first opportunity to score. They were unable to post points. Em-brace: Sam Williams cross for two tries as the Dragons secured their place in the top eight . Neville Costigan squandered a certain try knocking on before the try line. Moments later, Costigan's Papua New Guinea team-mate Jason Chan showed him how it was done, bouncing out of several tackles in a darting run across the pitch to give KR the lead again. Burns missed his second conversion of the match to leave the Robins leading 14-12. Once again the lead changed hands with a brilliant piece of opportunism by Dragons scrum-half Sam Williams. Catalan were awarded a penalty for obstruction and while Rovers stood around, Williams quickly tapped the ball and sprinted 65 metres brushing off Burns in the process to score. Bosc converted to give the visitors an 18-14 lead with 24 minutes to play. Rovers' season was hanging by a thread, but they were finally put out of their misery in the 70th minute when Oldfield completed his hat-trick. Bosc's missed conversion made it 22-14 with nine minutes to play. Williams compounded Rovers misery with his second try six minutes from time, following up his own kick with little resistance from the home side's defence. Bosc's third missed kick did not matter. He then finished the game by converting Morgan Escare's 25th try of the season to hammer the final nail in Rovers coffin.","Catalan Dragons recorded fourth away win of the Super League season .

Magic Weekend was first staged in Cardiff in 2007 and has also been held in Edinburgh as well as Manchester, which is favourite to regain the event from 2016 when it will have a new capacity. Super League general manager Blake Solly said: 'St James' Park is one of Britain's iconic sporting stadiums and Newcastle is a fantastic destination city that will provide the perfect backdrop to the First Utility Super League Magic Weekend. 'We did receive interest in staging Magic Weekend from a number of other venues but none provided as good a fit as Newcastle for many reasons, including its transport links, hotel and accommodation options and opportunities for our fans to enjoy a weekend to remember.' Super League was played in the north-east in 1999 when Gateshead Thunder entered the competition after the International Stadium had previously hosted an 'on-the-road' match between Leeds and Salford. Last time round: Wolves Ryan Atkins celebrates scoring against St Helens at the Etihad Stadium, Manchester . Thunder merged with Hull after only 12 months and moved to east Yorkshire but Gateshead re-formed as a Championship club and, after being recently taken over by Newcastle Falcons, will stage a play-off tie as part of a double-header with the rugby union club at Kingston Park on Sunday. Sean Bullick, chief executive of NE1 Ltd, said: 'NE1 is delighted to be hosting Magic Weekend and to be welcoming rugby league teams and fans to Newcastle. 'Large-scale events like this do a fantastic job of promoting Newcastle and the wider region. I'm sure visiting fans will have a fantastic time in the city and we hope this will be the best Magic Weekend so far.' Same again? Anthony Gelling of Wigan takes on Leeds' Carl Ablett during last season's Magic Weekend . Councillor Nick Forbes, leader of Newcastle City Council, said: 'Newcastle has a proven track record of hosting large-scale sporting events. 'With so much to do here and our famous hospitality, visitors are guaranteed a fantastic experience and a taste of Geordie Magic.' The league say the fixtures and kick-off times will be confirmed in mid-November. There will be one fewer fixture than this year due to the re-structuring and relegation of Bradford and London Broncos. Â .","Super League's Magic Weekend will be staged at St James' Park .

"By . Ian Laybourn, Press Association . Bradford will be hoping to cut down the opposition in the Kingstone Championship in 2015 with the aid of a player known as 'The Lumberjack'. Australian front rower Karl Davies, 22, who has has spent this season with Queensland Super Cup team Mackay Cutters, has agreed a two-year deal with the relegated Bulls and becomes their eighth new face for next season. 'I believe I can bring a lot to Bradford and am very excited about coming over to ply my trade with the Bulls,' said the 6ft 3in, 17st forward. 'I am an explosive and aggressive type of player, with a strong work ethic. Lumberjack: Bradfull Bulls have made Australian front rower Karl Davies their eighth off-season signing . 'Next season will act as a fresh start for the club and I am looking forward to getting my teeth into the Championship before, hopefully, playing in Super League the year after. 'The squad being put together looks very strong, there are some fantastic names on board and we are going to take some stopping.' Davies is due to arrive in the UK early next month, well in time for the start of pre-season training, and Bradford coach James Lowes is expecting his latest signing to become a fans' favourite. 'He is an explosive prop and he is someone I know will excite our supporters,' Lowes said. 'You need good, solid front-rowers in any leading side and Australia seems to deliver them. They know the job and do it well. 'He is a young and very talented individual and I like what I have seen of him.

"By . Pa Reporter . Stefan Marsh claimed a second half hat-trick as Widnes ensured their place in the Super League play-offs with a 32-12 victory at Bradford in a match which marked the end of top-flight rugby at Odsal. The Vikings, needing just a point to move out of reach of pre-match rivals Hull KR and Wakefield, outscored the Bulls seven tries to two with winger Paddy Flynn adding two more touchdowns and both Patrick Ah Van and Lloyd White notching one apiece. The success came after they rallied from 12-8 down at half-time and means Widnes will now contest play-off rugby for the first time. Hat-trick: Stefan Marsh is congratulated after scoring three tries against Bradford . Bradford, looking to go out on a high in their last home match before being relegated to the Kingstone Press Championship, waved goodbye to the retiring Matt Diskin. Yet the former Great Britain hooker could not feature in the game through injury, while Australian fullback Brett Kearney was among the other Bulls favourites who are leaving for pastures new. Looking to the future, Bradford handed a debut to 19-year old academy product Brad Adams at centre. The Vikings welcomed back Australian Cameron Phelps after several weeks out with a sternum injury. After boyhood Bulls fan and former Pop Idol runner-up Gareth Gates had performed for the crowd, and Diskin had been introduced on the pitch with his family, Widnes capitalised on a handling error by the home side to open the scoring within two minutes. The Bulls were caught short on their left side and a long missed pass from Danny Tickle put Flynn over near the corner flag, although Tickle failed to add the extras from the touchline. Play-off: After beating Bradford, Widnes have secured their place in the Super League play-offs . Flynn was in again after eight minutes when confusion, following a misplaced high bomb from Kevin Brown, allowed the ball back into Widnes hands off a Bradford player and the winger once more had a clear run to the corner. Tickle again swung the conversion wide and the Bulls hit back just three minutes later with momentum carrying Tom Olbison through an attempted tackle and over the whitewash. Luke Gale converted to take his career tally above the 500-point mark prior to his end-of-season departure for Castleford. Lee Gaskell went off temporarily after a quarter of an hour to be replaced by James Donaldson, who will remain in Super League with Hull KR next season, but the absence of their halfback would not break the Bulls' momentum as the Vikings were forced to drop out under their own posts on three occasions. Danny Williams was held up trying to touch down before the pressure eventually told and Chev Walker powered his way through a ruck of players to edge the home side in front, Gale again bisecting the uprights. Adams almost savoured a dream start to his senior career when claiming a Joe Mellor cross-kick and racing 60 metres upfield before being caught and seeing his pass go to ground. Then, 12 minutes into the second half, Adams dream turned to a nightmare as he was controversially adjudged to have knocked on a grubber kick. It appeared the ball had moved backwards, and Widnes immediately capitalised to score through Marsh. Tickle, having missed twice, this time struck the post with the ball bouncing out to leave the scores level at 12-12. It hardly mattered as barely three minutes later Marsh struck again in almost the same place to put the Vikings back in front yet, amazingly, Tickle then hit the other upright. Marsh completed his hat-trick from a Brown pass with 11 minutes to go, although it came as little surprise and to ironic cheers when Tickle kept his unwanted 100 per cent record by missing his fifth straight conversion. To rub salt in Bradford's wounds, former Bulls winger Ah Van grabbed a late sixth try and White a seventh for Widnes. With Tickle now off the pitch, Phelps converted each to leave a slightly unreflective final score.","Widnes beat Bradford 32-12 .

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . England's Paul Casey celebrated the recent birth of his first child by claiming his 13th European Tour title in the KLM Open on Sunday. Casey, whose fiance Pollyanna Woodward gave birth to a baby boy on September 1, carded a closing 66 at Kennemer Golf Club to finish 14 under par, one ahead of three-time champion Simon Dyson. England's Andy Sullivan was another stroke back in third but also won a trip into space worth $100,000 (£61,500) for a hole-in-one on the 15th, although he admitted he was not certain to become an amateur astronaut. Paul Casey stormed into the lead with four birdies in the first seven holes during his final round . 'I'm not sure yet,' said Sullivan, who holed out with a nine iron on the 163-yard hole on his way to a closing 67. 'I'll see what the missus says!' Casey began the day four shots off the lead - just as he did before his last victory in the Irish Open in 2013 - but made the ideal start with four birdies in his first seven holes, and with overnight leader Romain Wattel dropping a shot on the seventh, Casey moved into a lead he was not about to relinquish. A birdie on the 14th was followed by his only bogey of the day on the 15th and with Dyson making a birdie on the last to complete a flawless 65, Casey's lead was down to a single shot. However, the former world number three held his nerve to close with three pars and seal the victory. Casey told reporters: 'I'm absolutely over the moon. First tournament as a dad, first win as a dad. 'I'm a bit emotional to be honest. It was very care free for three and a half days, because if I played well or poorly I was going to go home to see my baby, and then I got to the last three holes and I thought I really want this. 'Just having my first child was a great distraction. I had no expectations coming into the week and I did very little pratice, even flying in Wednesday morning to spend as much time at home as possible, so I was apprehensive as to how I was going to play. 'I couldn't have dreamed it would turn out this way. It's not that I wasn't trying my hardest on the course, but you just don't know how it will turn out. 'This tournament has been going for more than 90 years and looking at the names on the trophy, you have Seve (Ballesteros), (Bernhard) Langer, Payne Stewart. It's got some great names so to add my name to that is a great honour.' Paul Casey's 66 give him the win by one shot in his first tournament after becoming a father . Sullivan needed treatment for altitude sickness in the mountains of Switzerland during last week's European Masters, so it was no surprise that he gave out mixed messages about his hole-in-one prize. 'It was such a rollercoaster out there today and this week so to top it off by going to space is great,' said the former Walker Cup star. 'I was on the comeback after a few bad holes and the caddie pulled out a nine iron and said try to cut it in there, luckily it came off and it went in. 'I'm not sure if I'll go, I'll check with the missus. I'm not great with heights or flying! I might have to pluck up some serious courage, but it is a once in a lifetime experience, so I'm going to have to do it.' Runner-up Dyson added: 'It was a really good week. I got better every day and played really nicely, shot five under and felt like I left a few out there on the front nine. 'I always thought my total would be a bit short, even when Paul bogeyed the 15th. As soon as I got to 10 under my target was to get 14 under but I am really pleased with the week.' Andy Sullivan made a hole-in-one at the fifteenth to win a trip to space worth over £60,000 .","Paul Casey hits final round 66 to win by one shot .

"By . Pa Reporter . Forward Brett Ferres scored the try that broke Hull as the Huddersfield Giants extended their unbeaten run in the First Utility Super League to six matches with an exciting comeback. Ferres dived over in the left corner in a spell of three tries in eight second-half minutes that turned the game on its head and ultimately secured a 38-28 victory for the hosts. Hull led 18-4 inside half an hour but Jodie Broughton cut the arrears to 22-20 with a converted score in the 54th minute. Ferres put Huddersfield in front for the first time and they never looked back as their quest for a top-four finish received a further boost. On a roll: Huddersfield celebrate Brett Ferres's try that set the Giants on the way to victory over Hull . Prop Anthony Mullally and in-form Jermaine McGillvary, who has now scored eight tries in his last six outings, added gloss to the score. Visitors Hull, gunning for a third win in four matches, seemed on course to do the double over Huddersfield following a 30-6 win at the KC Stadium in April. Australian stand-off Jordan Rankin twice did the damage with kicks that caught the Huddersfield defence napping. His high kick into the right corner in the seventh minute was dropped and Danny Houghton pounced to race over the line. Rankin also delivered a defence-splitting kick in the 27th minute timed perfectly for Jamie Shaul's diagonal run. In between, Houghton set up Aaron Heremaia for a try to ensure a happy swansong in his last away match for Hull before moving to Widnes next season. Rankin converted all three tries and kicked high again in the 44th minute only for Fetuli Talanoa to drop the ball on the line. Huddersfield got off the mark in the 12th minute after controversy when a McGillvary solo try was ruled out. Double-up: Giant Jake Connor scored a brace of tries as his side kept touch with the Super League top four . The flying winger barged past several Hull players to the line and kept going despite a tackle that brought him down. Referee Phil Bentham ruled the try out, though from the restart Shaun Lunt put in academy product Jake Connor for a touchdown. Connor, an England youth international, then doubled up after a neat exchange of passes with Craig Kopzcak before half-time. Substitute David Faiumu kept Huddersfield in touch, though the usually reliable Danny Brough had an off-day with the boot. When Jordan Thompson dived over to make it 22-14 to Hull in the 50th minute an away win looked likely. But three tries in eight minutes turned the game and even though Gareth Ellis scored for Hull after that, Huddersfield still had the last word. Broughton went over in the left corner on the final hooter to confirm an entertaining comeback victory in front of 6,370 fans.","Huddersfield remain in touch with the top four after the win over Hull .

"By . John Greechan for MailOnline . Unable to play his way into the side, overlooked for a place among Paul McGinley’s elite corps of vice-captains, Paul Lawrie will still be contributing to the Team Europe cause at Gleneagles. For starters, he’ll be answering Ryder Cup rookie Stephen Gallacher’s invitation for a chat, the veteran of the Miracle at Medinah – and the Beastliness at Brookline before that – glad to pass on the benefits of his own experience. When the big transatlantic bash tees off, meanwhile, Lawrie will be right there in the throng – shouting himself hoarse in support of Stevie G and the boys. Paul Lawrie has missed out on a place in this year's European Ryder Cup team . Lawrie, pictured at Deeside Golf Club, will still be cheering the side on from the crowd . Scotsman Lawrie plays a shot during the Omega European Masters on September 6, 2014 in Switzerland . The former Open champion, a huge Aberdeen fan who aims to bring some of his Pittodrie verbals to Perthshire, didn’t hold back in expressing his disappointment when McGinley left him out of his backroom staff. Ask him now how he feels about being on the outside of the ropes and, candidly, he replies: ‘Nae great.’ The lure of a Ryder Cup on home soil is too strong to resist, though. So he’ll watch the opening day’s action on TV, before throwing himself into the role of supportive on-site spectator. ‘I’m heading down Friday night,’ he revealed. ‘The guy that we’ve got our car deal with, Morrison Motors, has a big house, so me and my wife are going down to spend the weekend with him. ‘So we’re going to be there – I’ll be walking around with Stevie, hopefully on the Saturday if he’s playing, then definitely on the Sunday. ‘It will feel a bit weird. Obviously I wanted to play but I can’t, so I just have to look forward to watching. I’m still looking forward to going and enjoying a great event. ‘It’ll be a fantastic atmosphere and there are about 10 of us staying in this house – all good pals – so it should be great fun. ‘I’ve never been to support at a Ryder Cup. It’s going to be a different experience when I get there – but I’ll enjoy it, get into it, be pulling for all the boys to play well. Former Open champion Lawrie was disappointed to miss out on a place in the European side . Lawrie putts during the third round of the Omega European Masters in front of a picturesque setting . ‘I’m a pretty big shouter at Pittodrie, I get right into it. And I’ll absolutely be giving it all of that at Gleneagles! But people won’t recognise me. I won’t have the usual gear on with all the sponsors’ badges covering me.’ This week, Lawrie is back at Celtic Manor, where he briefly – but not enjoyably, he says now – served as an on-course commentator for the 2010 Ryder Cup. Before now and his opening tee time in the ISPS Handa Wales Open on Thursday, he’ll keep that promise to sit down with Gallacher. Asked to provide a sneak preview of the best advice he might hand down to his fellow Scot, Lawrie said: ‘I remember when I played practice rounds with Monty, he said that it all happens pretty quickly. ‘You have to, not slow down exactly, but just take your time. Make your decisions deliberately. ‘Because everything goes by just so quick in that event. Everything is speeded up. ‘Walk at normal pace, that’s important. You can find yourself rushing off when you’re under pressure. But Stevie will know all that. He doesn’t need me to tell him. Lawrie hits a drive during his final round of the Omega European Masters at Crans-sur-Sierre Golf Club . Lawrie plays a shot on the 18th hole during Day 2 of the KLM Open on September 12, 2014 in Zandvoort . ‘He’ll love it. Absolutely love it. There are very few moments when you think: “Oh, I’m not so sure about this”. ‘There are a couple of moments when you’ll get that. But it goes pretty quickly. ‘No, he’ll just have a ball of a time. Especially with the crowd. I’m gutted I’ m not there – but delighted for him, obviously. ‘I’m sure we’re going to see each other this week for a bite to eat. He doesn’t need me to tell him what’s what – but anything he wants to run past me is fine, obviously. ‘It’s just whatever he wants to ask. He asked if it was all right to have a sit-down and pick my brains. It’s not an issue. ‘You’ve got to experience the nerves of a Ryder Cup to know what it’s like. But he’ll deal with it. ‘He’s been in pressure situations before, he’s won tournaments. When he was defending in Dubai, he played with Tiger and Rory. He knows what it’s all about. ‘Having said that, he has to magnify those experiences by 10, just to get an idea of the feelings he’ll experience. ‘But the crowd will help. He’ll know that most of them are there to watch him. And the first time he plays will be amazing.

"By . Derek Lawrenson for MailOnline . If Rory McIlroy ends up pocketing $11.44 million on Sunday, he might look back on the 14th hole of his second round of the Tour Championship with particular affection. A rare wayward tee shot during the course of an otherwise wonderful round on Friday could have been a card wrecker if it had stuck a tree and buried itself in the undergrowth. Instead it ricocheted kindly – and ended up in a spectator’s pocket. McIlroy was duly allowed a free drop, went on to make his par – and then closed with two birdies for a fabulous 65. ‘I think I probably owed the spectator rather more than a sweaty handshake,’ said McIlroy, smiling. ‘It could have gone anywhere and it really was a lucky bounce.’ A disappointed Rory McIlroy after a missed putt on the fifth green on Friday .

A wonderful climax to the PGA Tour season now seems assured this weekend with McIlroy tied for second place alongside Australian Jason Day and American Chris Kirk, who just happens to be leading the race for the FedEx Cup, with its alluring $10 million bonus. Out on his own with a two stroke lead is last week’s winner Billy Horschel, who stands number two in the FedEx standings and, like Kirk, will not be going to the Ryder Cup. What on earth must captain Tom Watson be thinking, sitting at home? Actually, Horschel, who shot 66 to continue his hot hand, gave us an idea when he revealed he had received a text from the five time Open Champion. It read: ‘Why didn’t you play like this earlier?’ .

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . The two young Americans who lie first and second in the FedEx Cup race and who were overlooked for the US Ryder Cup team just happen to be tied for the lead following the opening round of the Tour Championship on Thursday. Chris Kirk and Billy Horschel both shot 66 while two of captain Tom Watson’s wild cards, Webb Simpson and Hunter Mahan, lie tied 27th in the 29 man field after rounds of 74. Sparing Watson a sleepless night might have been the fact a quarter of the team who will fly to Gleneagles in ten days are all tied seventh or better. Rory McIlroy hits from behind a tree on the 15th during the first round of the Tour Championship . Leaders after round one: . Billy Horschel -4 . Chris Kirk -4 . Jim Furyk -3 . Bubba Watson -3 . Jason Day -3 . Patrick Reed -3 . Selected others: . Sergio Garcia -1 . Adam Scott -1 . Rickie Fowler -1 . Rory McIlroy -1 . Ever consistent Jim Furyk and Masters champion Bubba Watson both shot 67 while Zach Johnson and Georgia native Matt Kuchar finished with rounds of 68. As for Rory McIlroy, who needs to win this event to claim the $10 million FedEx bonus, he finished well for a 69 and then talked about the Twitter backlash on Wednesday night that left him aghast. There on social media, he was getting abused for purportedly saying that Phil Mickelson and Tiger Woods are washed up, and their day had come and gone. Which was, quite frankly, a travesty. Asked a straightforward question at his press conference on Wednesday about the absence of the pair from the Tour Championship for the first time since 1992, McIlroy gave a typically straightforward answer. ‘They’re just getting older,’ he responded. ‘Phil is 43 or whatever he is (he is 44) and Tiger is nearly 40. So they’re getting into the last few holes of their careers.’ Rory McIlroy hits a tee shot on the first hole  during the first round of the Tour Championship . Given Mickelson has been a pro for 23 years and Tiger for 19, it seemed a statement of the obvious, albeit a candid one. Thank goodness McIlroy did not feel the need to backtrack on Twitter. He was just anxious to clear up any misconceptions. ‘Got a question today about Tiger and Phil,’ he tweeted. ‘Gave an honest answer, was very complimentary about the 2 best golfers of this generation….golfers on average have a 20-25 year career, both into the back 9 of their careers….don’t think there is anything wrong with saying that.’ There is not, and thankfully his relationship with both the American superstars is more than strong enough to survive a ludicrous situation. ‘I know the guys well and believe me, I’ve said a lot worse to Tiger’s face,’ said McIlroy, smiling. After all the consistent golf McIlroy has played this season it was unusual to see him spray the ball with his driver for the first two-thirds of his round. ‘My timing was miles off,’ he said, and perhaps in previous years it might have led to an outward half of 40 shots or so to take him out of the ball game. Here he hung in well for a one under 34. Rory McIlroy reacts after missing a putt on the second hole during first round of the Tour Championship . Over the back nine his round was going nowhere until he rolled in a birdie putt at the 17th and then parred the last. ‘I’m obviously not firing on all cylinders but I think I found something right at the end that will be helpful over the next three days,’ he said. By his side, Watson was equally adventurous. He was three under for ten holes before an ugly double bogey at the 13th set him back. Watson responded brilliantly with three birdies in a row to take the lead on four under before dropping a shot at the last. Emerging American Kirk, whose recent play has been a revelation, underlined his talent once more, as did his playing partner Horschel. Out in the final group, they were so good they never mustered a single bogey between them all day – and will get to partner each other again on Friday. Chris Kirk bites the shaft of his putter after missing a birdie putt on the 18th . Justin Rose was one of the first on the course, and got off to the perfect start when he knocked in a 15ft birdie putt at the first. That, alas, was about as good as it got for the Englishman as he carded five bogeys in an untidy opening round of 72.

"By . Marcus Townend for the Daily Mail . Suddenly Frankie Dettori’s world doesn’t seem so bad. Six days after losing the ride on Arc favourite Treve at the request of trainer Criquette Head-Maarek, the Italian sat in the Weighing Room as the 2013 winner could finish fourth to Baltic Baroness in the Group One Prix Vermeille and her odds of landing a back-to-back Prix de L'Arc de Triomphe drifted to 10-1 with Ladbrokes. Quite what facial impression Dettori wore as events unfold can only be guessed at but it can’t have been as grim as that of his replacement Thierry Jarnet. Frankie Dettori raced Ruler of the World to victory during race at Longchamp . The Italian won The Qatar Prix Foy at Longchamp after bouncing back from his ride with Treve . Frankie Dettori chats with Sheikh Joaan Al Thani at Longchamp racecourse  in Paris, France . Adding to the bounce in the Dettori step was not only a win in the Prix Du Petit Couvert on Rae Guest’s Mirza but also that he still looks to have decent chance of an Arc ride, either with his Group Two Prix Foy winner Ruler Of the World or Ectot, impressive winner of the Prix Niel. For the latter to happen Ectot’s jockey Gregory Benoit will have to choose to partner his unbeaten French Oaks winner Avenir Certain but the bookmaker’s verdict indicate it will be a tough choice. Coral have Ectot, who was a 16-1 shot going into the Niel and hadn’t run since April in an injury-disrupted season, sharing Arc favouritism at 5-1 with Avenir Certain. Dettori’s boss Sheik Joaan Al Thani is only joint owner of Ectot and Ruler Of The World and cannot dictate jockey plans but there is bound to be pressure behind the scenes to get his No 1 jockey a ride. After partnering Ruler of The World to a length and a half win from Flintshire, the Aidan O’Brien-trained colt’s first success since last year’s Derby, Dettori said: ‘Aidan gave me a bundle of confidence. I hope he might be my Arc ride but it is out of my hands. I have to see what everyone else does. The jockey whispers into the ear of Sheikh Joaan Al Thani at Longchamp racecourse . ‘Treve was exactly like Ascot. Last year I was having a job holding her, she was that good. Today she was not moving the same and you have seen the result.’ Treve, racing for the first time since Royal Ascot, seems to have lost her zip and has lost all three runs this season. Head-Maarek, however, insisted: ‘She needed that run - don’t rule her out.’ With German Derby winner Sea The Moon ruled out of the Arc over the weekend, the latest trials also strengthened the position of King George and Oaks winner Taghrooda. She is 5-1 and committed to the race after being season was put forward as a reason for her Yorkshire Oaks defeat last month. Saturday’s St Leger winner Kingston Hill is 10-1 for the Arc. His trainer Roger Varian and jockey Andrea Atzeni also won yesterday’s Group One Moyglare Stud Stakes at the Curragh with Cursory Glance.","The Italian jockey bounced back from ride on Arc favourite Treve .

Kingman’s place in the line-up for the Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot on October 18 has been thrown into doubt after Khaled Abdullah’s colt picked up a throat infection. The John Gosden-trained four-time group one winner could be re-routed to the Breeders’ Cup Mile at Santa Anita in California if he is forced to swerve the big mile race on British Champions day which is now a target for Sunday’s Freddie Head-trained Prix du Moulin winner Charm Spirit. Gosden, whose Pomology was second in the Prix Vermeille, said: ‘It is annoying. He is the only horse in the stable affected and has never had a sore throat before. His chances of running depend on how long he is on antibiotics.’ Kingman, ridden to victory by James Doyle at Goodwood in July, is in doubt for the Queen Elizabeth Stakes .

"By . Marcus Townend for MailOnline . The formbook shouted Derby runner-up Kingston Hill was the class act in the Ladbrokes St Leger and the 9-4 favourite proved it emphatically at Doncaster with a length and a quarter win. Now trainer Roger Varian, winning his first Classic, has set his sights on the Prix De L'Arc De Triomphe in three week's time. His colt's odds for the biggest race in Europe have been cut to 10-1 by Saturday's sponsors. Jockey Andrea Atzeni celebrates after victory on Kingston Hill in the St Leger at Doncaster . The Leger result was also a massive endorsement of the Epsom Derby form. Runner-up was Epsom third Romsdal, who narrowly failed to give his trainer John Gosden a fifth Leger win. Sir Michael Stoute's Snow Sky, hampered as the winner hung left in the closing stages – a manoeuvre which meant he had to survive a Stewards' Enquiry - was two lengths further back in third. The build-up had been dominated by doubts over Kingston Hill running with concern quickening ground might force Varian to pull out his colt just as he had done for his two previous intended runs. But Kingston Hill coped and also demonstrated reserves of stamina his pedigree questioned with a sweeping run which started at the back of the field over three furlongs out in the mile and three-quarter race. Kingston Hill (far left) powers to victory at Doncaster racecourse on Saturday afternoon . Varian, 35, in his fourth season training, said: 'He looked a Classic horse at the start of the year and he has won Classic. 'I still think the ground is quicker than ideal for him but he has handled it. When he gets his conditions he will be an even better horse. 'He has not had a busy summer. Hopefully he has not finished yet this year. You would have to consider a crack at the Arc.' Kingston Hill, who won the Group One Racing Post Trophy at Doncaster last year, is owned by Buckingham-based Paul Smith and named after a local hill the fitness-conscious owner regular cycles up. Andrea Atzeni shows off his latest piece of silverware after leading Kingston Hill to the finish line first . He was joined in the winner's enclosure by father Derrick, whose colours are carried by Derby winner Australia and who helicoptered to Ireland to watch his colt in the Irish Champion after the presentations. Saturday's win was also a first Classic for 23-year-old jockey Andrea Atzeni as well as being his 100th win of the year.

It's terrible.' Hours after the report on Wednesday, Goodell announced former FBI director Robert S Mueller III will conduct a probe into how the league pursued and handled evidence as it investigated claims against Rice.

(WARNING - GRAPHIC CONTENT) NFL commissioner Roger Goodell said the league had not seen the Ray Rice video until this week . Former FBI Director Robert S Mueller III will conduct an investigation into the NFL's handling of evidence . NFL spokesman Greg Aiello said in a statement that the investigation will be overseen by owners John Mara of the New York Giants and Art Rooney of the Pittsburgh Steelers. Goodell said that Mueller will have access to all NFL records and will have full cooperation from league personnel. The law enforcement official, speaking to the AP on condition of anonymity because of the ongoing investigation, says he had no further communication with any NFL employee and can't confirm anyone watched the video. The person said he was unauthorised to release the video but shared it unsolicited, because he wanted the NFL to have it before deciding on Rice's punishment. Caught on camera: Ray Rice (right) punched his then fiancee Janay Palmer (left) in a lift in Atlantic City . Hurt: Janay Rice's Instagram post in which she reacts angrily to the media . The NFL has repeatedly said it asked for but could not obtain the video of the Baltimore Ravens running back hitting Janay Palmer - who is now his wife - at an Atlantic City casino in February. The league says it has no record of the video, and no one in the league office had seen it until it was released by TMZ Monday. When asked about the voicemail on Wednesday, NFL officials repeated their assertion that no league official had seen the video before Monday. 'We have no knowledge of this,' NFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said. 'We are not aware of anyone in our office who possessed or saw the video before it was made public on Monday. We will look into it.' Calm before the storm: The couple are seen arguing in the lift in Atlantic City . Shocking: Rice punches his then fiancee in the face with his left hand, knocking her out . Out cold: Palmer was dragged from the lift after it stopped and Rice was later arrested .

The law enforcement official said he sent a DVD copy of the security camera video to an NFL office and included his contact information. He asked the AP not to release the name of the NFL executive for fear that the information would identify the law enforcement official as the source. Goodell initially suspended Rice for two games following the February incident, but the Ravens released Rice on Monday and the NFL suspended him indefinitely after TMZ released the video. Goodell told CBS on Tuesday that 'no one in the NFL, to my knowledge' had seen a new video of what happened on the elevator until it was posted online. 'We assumed that there was a video. We asked for video. But we were never granted that opportunity,' Goodell said.

Vermote’s team-mate Michal Kwiatkowski led a pack of leading contenders, including Team Sky’s Sir Bradley Wiggins, over the line one minute 20 seconds behind the stage winner, and it took another 63 seconds for Dowsett to make it home. Julien Vermote of Omega Pharma-Quick Step wins stage seven of the 2014 Tour of Britain . Julien Vermote of Omega Pharma-Quick Stepis cheered by the crowd a the end of stage seven . That put Garmin-Sharp’s Dylan van Baarle - another rider from the breakaway - into yellow, 19 seconds ahead of Kwiatkowski and 25 clear of Bardiana’s Edoardo Zardini. Irishman Nicolas Roche is fourth, 35 seconds down, while Wiggins is seventh, 47 seconds down - still very much in contention ahead of the split final day which includes a time trial and a circuit race in central London. Van Baarle got himself in a five-man breakaway who went early and built a huge lead which topped nine minutes during the 226.5km run from Camberley. The gap began to tumble and with 15km to go Vermote decided to go it alone at the front. Race leader Alex Dowsett was left behind after a peleton split between Camberley and Brighton . Sir Bradley Wiggins of Great Britain and Team SKY signs autographs at the start of stage seven . Soon after, the peloton began to split behind with Kwiatkowski, Wiggins and Roche helping establish a 15-man breakaway which soon left Dowsett and Movistar behind - the Essex man perhaps paying for the huge efforts he put in on Friday. Vermote took the stage 23 seconds ahead of Van Baarle and Ignatas Konovalovas from the break, but the key gap was the one back to Wiggins and company, and it leaves all to play for on the final day.

"By . Richard Gibson For The Daily Mail . Jamie Ward produced a sparkling return to action with a double that propelled Derby onto the coat-tails of the Championship play-off places. Ward, who missed the weekend draw with Nottingham Forest with a hamstring niggle, helped Steve McClaren’s team overcome a frenetic opening to record their first away win in the league this season. They fell behind with just 51 seconds on the clock when Blackburn’s Ben Marshall scored his third goal at Ewood Park inside a week, following a brace in the 3-1 Lancashire derby win over Wigan. Jamie Ward celebrates his second goal for Derby County . Ben Marshall (right) of Blackburn slides in on Craig Bryson (left) Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant celebrates his side's second goal . Blackburn Rovers: Robinson (GK), Kilgallon (Varney 89), Baptiste, Olsson, Hanley, Conway (Tunnicliffe 65), Evans (Duffy 90), Marshall, Cairney, Rhodes, Gestede . Substitutes not used: Steele (GK), Taylor, Williamson, King . Scorer: Marshall 1, Gestede 78 . Derby County: Grant (GK), Whitbread, Christie, Keogh, Forsyth, Eustace, Hughes (Mascarell 82), Bryson, Ward (Russell 73), Dawkins (Ibe 74), Martin . Substitutes not used: Roos (GK), Naylor, Thomas, Shotton . Scorer: Ward 9, 58, Hughes 37 . Booked: Ward 45+1, Eustace 52, . Referee: David Webb . Attendance: 13,566 . Such had been the tempo of Blackburn’s start, in fact, that Marshall had already pinged one effort over the top when he sized up a second shot and watched it loop fortuitously over Derby goalkeeper Lee Grant via two deflections. Undeterred, Derby trailed for just seven minutes courtesy of another slice of fortune. Slipped into space by Simon Dawkins’ slick pass, Craig Bryson shanked his shot but the ball arrived at the back post off a Blackburn boot and Ward celebrated his return from injury by dispatching it into the roof of the net. With the free-running Dawkins as the catalyst for many, McClaren’s team’s attacks were swift and incisive. Indeed, they might have been ahead before the quarter hour only for Bryson to fire over when well placed. But they did turn the contest on its head eight minutes before the break when Will Hughes got off the mark for the season with an exquisite finish, a curling effort with his left foot from the edge of the area. And it could have been an even greater margin separating the teams at the interval but Hughes’ dink from the dead-ball line was volleyed waywardly over by Chris Martin. Blackburn's Marcus Olsson (left) battles with Derby's Johnny Russell (right) Jamie Ward celebrates his second goal in front of the travelling fans . Cyrus Christie (left) and Will Hughes (right) in action for Derby County . The two-goal advantage was forthcoming before the hour, however, as Ward converted a controversial second. Blackburn were left fuming at referee David Webb after Ward appeared to barge Craig Conway over before haring down on goal. The Northern Ireland international weaved his way into the area, manufactured the space to clip around Paul Robinson with a step-over and duly did so with his left foot. Unlike many opponents of pre-season promotion fancies Derby, who have taken a defensive approach to muzzle their creative hub in midfield, Rovers manager Gary Bowyer plumped for adventure, sticking with the same personnel and 4-4-2 formation that overwhelmed Wigan. Conversely, it meant they had the firepower to hit back. Craig Conway of Blackburn Rovers leaps for the ball . Chris Martin of Derby County reacts after missing an opportunity at goal . When Jordan Rhodes is involved goals can come from nothing but it was his less prolific strike partner Rudy Gestede that gave the hosts a lifeline a dozen minutes from time. Taking a throw-in on his knee, the Frenchman produced an instinctive near-post finish through the legs of Grant. Moments later Grant – roundly booed for his Burnley past – was forced to tip over a Tom Cairney 25-yard drive at full stretch and Blackburn’s high octane finish also witnessed Gestede’s downward header in injury strike the crossbar. But try as they might they could not muster the equalizer that would have preserved their unbeaten home record. Derby playes celebrate Ward's second goal of the night .

"By . Pa Reporter . Movistar's Alex Dowsett stormed into the race lead of the Friend's Life Tour of Britain as Matthias Brandle collected his second consecutive stage victory in another breakaway. Essex-born Dowsett began stage six one minute 25 seconds behind Omega Pharma-Quick Step's Michal Kwiatkowski in the general classification but got himself in the break along with IAM Cycling's Brandle and Tom Stewart of Madison Genesis, and together they entirely changed the shape of the Tour. Capitalising on the time trialling skills of both Brandle and Dowsett, they built a lead of more than nine minutes on the road, and the peloton rarely looked capable of bringing it back despite some frantic efforts from Omega Pharma-Quick Step in the closing stages of the challenging 205.6km run from Bath to Hemel Hempstead. Matthias Brandle celebrates winning stage six of the 2014 Tour of Britain as Alex Dowsett of Great Britain watches the TV to check if he has taken the race lead after stage six . Great Britain's Alex Dowsett celebrates being the new race leader after stage six of the Tour of Britain . All the racers gather towards the end of stage six of the 2014 Tour of Britain . Dowsett showed no interest in contesting Brandle for the stage victory on the final straight, knowing his job was done as he took a 34 second lead in the overall standings. It was just reward for a rider who put a huge effort into a breakaway on stage four, only to have all his hard work undone by a double puncture. 'It was the hardest day of my life,' Dowsett said on ITV4. 'I just thought they were letting us out to bring us back and I was a bit hacked off with myself because I thought I could have a good time trial but I was leaving a lot out on the road and I might have given too much. 'Once the gap went up to seven minutes I thought, that's quite big, then it was eight, nine, and I really started digging in. 'I spoke to Matthias and we made an agreement he would go for the stage because I knew there was a good chance I would take yellow and it was a risk I was willing to take. 'He gave me everything. I couldn't have done it without him and Tom too from Madison Genesis. He probably had the hardest day of his life, he gave all he could and I'm grateful to him.' The break's lead reached 9mins 15secs with a little over 87km to go before the peloton stepped up the chase. Omega Pharma-Quick Step and Team Sky were prominent on the front, but they had left themselves too much to do. The gap dipped under five minutes with 33km to go, but it was not coming down quickly enough and there was a lull in the chase as teams began to look at each other. As they moved inside the final 10km it was Kwiatkowski on the front, desperate to keep his yellow jersey, but it would prove to be in vain.

Dowsett now leads Kwiatkowski by 34 seconds, with the Italian Eduardo Zardini (Bardiani) 40 seconds behind in third and Tinkoff-Saxo's Nicholas Roche 50 seconds back in fourth. Defending champion Sir Bradley Wiggins had been focused on keeping himself there or thereabouts until the final time trial on Sunday, but while Sky took the odd turn on the front, they were barely seen towards the end of the day and Dowsett's move leaves Wiggins with much work to do on Saturday's 226.5km run from Camberley to Brighton, sitting 62 seconds down in seventh place.","Matthias Brandle wins stage six of the Tour of Britain .

"The Football Association has announced proposals to cut the number of players from outside the European Union coming into the English game by up to 50 per cent. Some 122 overseas players were granted visas between 2009 and 2013, 23 of them in the Football League. The FA is proposing only Premier League clubs be allowed to sign non-EU players, and also be prevented from sending them out on loan, as part of a number of changes recommended by FA chairman Greg Dyke's England Commission. Alejandro Faurlin, who joined QPR in 2009, would not have been granted a permit under the proposed rules . Greg Dyke's England Commission suggested the changes which would limit the number of non-EU players . Furthermore, only players from the top 50-ranked countries in the world could be signed unless the transfer fee is more than a fixed figure, either £10million or £15million. An FA statement said: 'The defined criteria are designed to result in visas only for those elite sportspeople who are internationally established at the highest level [and] whose employment will make a significant contribution to the development of their sport at the highest level in the UK.' The appeals system would also be toughened up so that clubs can only appeal on the basis of incorrect process - currently nearly 80% of all appeals are successful and tribunals are often asked to make subjective judgments on playing ability. The ruling would apply to all players from Brazil, Argentina, Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Australasia who do not hold EU passports. Emmanuel Adebayor would have not been given a permit as he arrived from a nation outside the top 50 for £7m . Willian joined Chelsea last summer under the old system despite having only played for Brazil twice at the time . The proposals are contained in an FA consultative paper - which it is required to produce under Home Office rules - and it will now hold talks with the Premier League, Football League, PFA, LMA and the national FAs of Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. One change would make it slightly easier for the best non-EU players to gain work permits by reducing from 75 per cent to 30 per cent the number of competitive international matches that non-EU players from countries in the top 30 must have played in the previous two years. The system, called the Governing Body Endorsement (GBE) process, was introduced by the Home Office in 2008 to allow sports governing bodies to each manage a system for endorsing visa applications of elite players from non-EU countries.","23 overseas players given work permits outside Premier League since 2009 .

Villa have kept three clean sheets in their opening four games with a new-look back four. Alan Hutton, who signed a new three-year contract on Tuesday, has been recalled after a two-year exile while summer signings Aly Cissokho and Senderos have also impressed. Boss Lambert believes the club are finally on the up after three years battling relegation. He said: ""I think the lads have become men. They have been excellent.

"By . Mark Teece . The Tampa Bay Buccaneers head to the Georgia Dome to take on the Atlanta Falcons, with both teams looking to turn their early season form around. Last season, this NFC South divisional match-up was split 1-1 with the home team emerging victorious on both occasions. The Falcons made an impressive start to the 2014 season with a 37-34 victory over divisional rival rivals the New Orleans Saints. Quarterback Matt Ryan set a franchise record in that game, throwing for 448 yards and three touchdowns. Any euphoria that may have spilt over into Sunday’s game against Cincinnati quickly diminished as Atlanta’s deficiencies along the offensive line were exposed during a crushing 24-10 defeat by the Cincinnati Bengals. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Matt Ryan threw a record  448 yards and three touchdowns against New Orleans but completed just 24 of 44 passes against Cincinnati . Wide receiver Roddy White is in doubt for the Falcons after missing Monday's training with a hamstring injury . Ryan looked a shadow of himself, completing just 24 of 44 passes for 231 yards, and one touchdown. Ryan was under duress throughout the contest, throwing three interceptions and taking two sacks. Wideout Roddy White missed training on Monday due to a hamstring injury and remains questionable. He would be a huge loss for the Falcons as White averages 11.4 yards per reception. With White listed as questionable, look for Harry Douglas and Devin Hester to have an increased role. Tampa Bay’s new defensive scheme under Lovie Smith will have their hands full trying to contain Douglas – who amassed 283 yards and two touchdowns last year. Despite the play of rookie quarterback Mike Glennon during Tampa's miserable 2013 campaign, head coach Smith has opted to go with experience under centre. Josh McCown joined the Bucs on a two-year deal following an impressive stint in Chicago during Jay Cutler’s absence - recording 13 touchdowns and just one interception. However, McCown’s play from last season has yet to carry over into this season for the Buccaneers. Another player who seems to revel in this this fixture is Bucs running back Bobby Rainey. The last time the two met, Rainey rushed for 163 yards and scored three touchdowns. Josh McCown's form from his run with Chicago last campaign is yet to emerge for Tampa Bay . Running back Bobby Rainey scored three TDs and rushed for  163 yards last time out against the Falcons . With Doug Martin out (knee) the Falcons will have their work cut out as the defense has surrendered an average of four yards per carry. Should the offensive line hold up for McCown, look for him to expose the Falcons secondary who give up a current league high of nine yards per reception. Wideout Vincent Jackson has been McCown’s go-to guy during the team’s first two games, Jackson has been targeted 16 times, reeling in eight of those for 87 yards. Rookie Mike Evans is growing in confidence with every snap and made an impressive 29-yard catch during the 19-17 loss to the St Louis Rams. Evans was shaken up late in the game, but is expected to play on Thursday. To have your say on the NFL, listen to the UK's live call in show on Sundays from 4pm.

'We have got to try to start winning a couple of games, but if we keep showing the desire that we showed in the last 15, 20 minutes and maybe do that at the beginning of the game - because it started very difficult for us - maybe we can get better results. 'We are looking for our first win in any of the games, and hopefully that will start next week. It's away from home, but if we can show the desire that we showed on Saturday and maybe finish a few more of our chances and stop them at the back, we have got a good chance.' Sunderland had to show desire and a great deal more to emerge from the game with tangible reward. They fell behind with less than two minutes on the clock when Nacer Chadli followed up after goalkeeper Vito Mannone had beaten away Emmanuel Adebayor's shot, but were back on terms almost immediately as Adam Johnson embarked upon a scything run into the box and finished with aplomb. John O'Shea and Wes Brown celebrate Harry Kane's late own goal which earned them a point against Spurs . However, with Christian Eriksen and Erik Lamela proving impossible to shackle and Moussa Dembele prompting, the visitors dominated for long periods and Dembele was unfortunate to see a 38th-minute drive come back off the post with Mannone stranded. They regained the lead within three minutes of the restart when Eriksen stabbed home from close range, but they failed to build upon it - although Lamela was denied a third goal by the crossbar - and Sunderland responded once again. Gus Poyet's men were level with eight minutes remaining when substitute Harry Kane inadvertently turned Jordi Gomez's free-kick into his own net, and they might have snatched victory at the death, only for Will Buckley to sky over from Patrick van Aanholt's pull-back. Brown said: 'They played very well. They always put pressure on us and made it very difficult for us. They hit the post and the crossbar a couple of times. Wes Brown said that Sunderland need to step up their game this season if they want to climb the table . 'But we managed to carry on. You could say they got a little bit tired near the end and we just kept pushing on, and eventually we got something out of probably just the fight. We kept on going and managed to get the own goal.' Poyet was delighted to have come away with a point even if he might have had all three. He said: 'I'm not going to say I expected something from the game because I thought they were better than us, but we nearly nicked it at the end with Buckley's chance. 'That would have been very unfair on them [Spurs], but that's football, that's football in the Barclays Premier League if you are compact and you know your options until the end.' Sunderland have now drawn against Tottenham, Manchester United and West Brom . If Poyet was a happy man, opposite number Mauricio Pochettino was understandably less so. He said: 'I am not worried because the most important thing is to create the chances. We have scored two goals away - maybe we had the facility to score more. But we need to be be more solid. 'My responsibility is to analyse the first goal that we conceded because, when you concede the first goal like we conceded it today after you have scored at beginning of the game, we need to be smarter and more aggressive because it was too easy for Sunderland to score.'","Sunderland have failed to win any of first three Premier League games .

"By . Craig Hope for the Daily Mail . If Lee Cattermole gets through this weekend’s trip to Burnley without seeing red, it will mark 30 matches since his last dismissal. Now that is hardly a cause for celebration for the majority of players, but when you consider the Sunderland midfielder was previously averaging a sending-off every 26.5 Premier League games, his satisfaction at such a run is perhaps justified. At 26, England hopeful Cattermole believes he has settled down, on and off the pitch. One influence is Black Cats manager Gus Poyet, himself a hothead prone to red cards during his playing days. The other is a girlfriend as well as the passage of time. Lee Cattermole (left) challenges with Tottenham Hotspur's Paulinho (right) Cattermole (centre) juggles the ball during a Sunderland training session at the Academy of Light . Cattermole, who believes he has now settled down, pictured with Manchester United's Juan Mata (right) ‘You just grow up a bit don't you?’ said the player once nicknamed “Lee Clattermole” and who was cautioned by police after damaging five vehicles during a night out in Newcastle in 2012. ‘What is important is that you go through ups and downs and eventually you work out what helps you bring about a consistent level of performance. That's what I'm trying to do. I'm trying to find that consistent level for 30 to 35 games. ‘I don't want to be the best player one week and the worst the next. I'm trying to be a good solid performer every week. I feel I'm at that level now. ‘I think that is all down to being a bit older. I am 26 now, no longer a 20-year-old. I've been around a long time now as I was in the first team at Middlesbrough at 17. I just think sometimes you are just not old enough to be in the position you are in. It takes time to figure out things yourself. Cattermole has been working hard in training and is trying to become a solid performer week in, week out . Cattermole (left), pictured with Tottenham's Christian Eriksen (right), feels he has now been given a big role . ‘The experiences I had as a 17-year-old will stand me in good stead and now I feel I'm coming to a good time in my career because of what happened in the past. I wouldn't change things. ‘I have got a girlfriend now and I have settled down a bit, but I have always prepared right for games. I have always taken my football very seriously, but when I was younger I wasn't as calm on the pitch as I could have been. ‘Things also happened off the pitch which got blown out of proportion. I am more focussed now and feel I am at a good time in my career.’ The faith of Poyet has also been a key factor. Cattermole was dropped after a horror show at Hull last season but returned to help the club escape relegation. And he went on: ‘I played at Hull last season and had the best half of football in my career in the first and ended up giving away two goals in the second then didn't play for 10 games. Tottenham's Danny Rose (left) goes down under pressure from Cattermole at the Stadium of Light . ‘I was really disappointed because I thought I was playing brilliantly at the time and had played in the Capital One Cup final the week before. I then found myself out the team despite thinking I had been our best player for the previous couple of weeks. ‘But these are problems you are going to face as a footballer and you have got to come back in the right way. Now, I think he (Poyet) has given me a role in the team. ‘It is a big role which you have seen in Gus Poyet sides in the past. It is that defensive midfielder position. ‘I've listened to everything he has spoken about in training. There has been ups and downs but lately it has been going a lot more in the right direction.’ Cattermole (left) fights with Hull City's David Meyler (right) Cattermole celebrates with his team-mates after Harry Kane of Tottenham scored an own goal .","Lee Cattermole was previously averaging a red card every 26.5 games .

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for the Daily Mail . Follow @@riathalsam . His legs might not be as fresh as they once were, but Esteban Cambiasso’s brain and left foot are as sharp as ever. They might just keep Leicester City in the Barclays Premier League. That is Nigel Pearson’s hope — and a realistic one — after watching the midfielder with the huge trophy cabinet transform his club’s weekend. Leicester were crushed for 45 minutes, spared only by the inability of Stoke’s attackers to put their chances on target. Estaban Cambiasso (second left) looks delighted at the end of the game as Leicester got their first win . Former Inter Milan midfielder Cambiasso celebrates with Leonardo Ulloa after the latter scored his goal . Then Cambiasso, whose 23 European and domestic titles match Lionel Messi’s haul, entered at half-time. This was Leicester’s first clean sheet in 12 Premier League games. Within one minute the Argentine was directing his team-mates. Within five, he had pinged a 40-yard through-ball for £8million striker Leonardo Ulloa, who later scored his third in four games. Cambiasso was deemed surplus to requirements by Inter Milan in the summer, but in a side with a glaring lack of top-level know-how, Cambiasso looks to be a perfect fit. In a team without much Premier League experience Estaban Cambiasso could make the difference this year . Pearson said: ‘He is well respected by the players and staff. He has authority. He also has a humility that is very refreshing and I am very confident he will have a positive effect on the players.’ The result meant Stoke have lost both their home games this season, with Mark Hughes frustrated his side are not yet getting the best out of Bojan, their summer signing from Barcelona. He said: ‘Bojan did OK. We need to get him between the lines more than we were able to. But it is about introducing him into the right games. ‘We need to give the ball a bit quicker and on more occasions. If we do that he will have key moments and create chances.’ Leonardo Ulloa scored the only goal of the game with a lovely finish to earn all three points .

Every morning Sportsmail brings you the biggest gossip and headlines on the continent, giving you your early morning fix from the biggest leagues across Europe. The main focus on the continent on Tuesday is on the return of the Champions League, with Barcelona and Real Madrid unsurprisingly capturing the headlines in Spain. Lionel Messi is emblazoned across the front page of Mundo Deportivo as he goes in search of Raul's all-time Champions League scoring record as Barca face APOEL Nicosia. Lionel Messi (67) and Cristiano Ronaldo (68) go in search of Raul's Champions League record of 71 goals . The Argentinian has scored 67 goals in Europe's premier competition - one fewer than Cristiano Ronaldo and three fewer than Raul. Sport leads with the story that Barca boss Luis Enrique has described Ivan Rakitic as the perfect 'No 10' who can inspire the Catalans to glory this season. In Marca, however, the focus is on Real Madrid as they aim to defend their Champions League crown. Marca claim Real face a 'triple test' to retain the trophy and Sport labels Ivan Rakitic as the perfect 'No 10' According to the newspaper they face a 'triple test' of aiming to become the first side to retain the trophy in the Champions League era, to correct their poor start to the season with a victory over Basle and to convert the booing of Iker Casillas into an 'ovation'. AS, meanwhile, have Ronaldo as their top story with the forward 'pulling the wagon' at the Bernabeu. His 17 goals last season gives the holders hope they can recover from their current slump. Cristiano Ronaldo is described as 'pulling the wagon' at Real Madrid last season by AS due to his 17 goals . Both Milan clubs are given prominence on the front of La Gazetta dello Sport in Italy as they continue their 'revival'. Between Inter (a 7-0 win over Sassuolo) and AC (a narrow 5-4 victory over Parma), 12 goals were scored over the weekend and optimism is returning to the fashion capital of Italy. Neither side will be in the Champions League, however, as Inter only reached the Europa League and AC did not even qualify for Europe. But in both Tuttosport and Corriere dello Sport, Juventus are the focus. The Italian champions endured a dreadful campaign last year and Corriere says Juve must 'try again' to progress further, while Tuttosport explains that they 'need to perform' after the 'delusion' of the previous season. La Gazetta dello Sport believes optimism is finally returning to both Inter Milan and AC Milan this season .

The Northern Ireland international was jeered as he left the pitch to be replaced by Sebastian Blanco during the 2-0 defeat to Everton.

West Bromwich Albion goalkeeper Ben Foster has called the booing of Chris Brunt by fans as 'pathetic' But England goalkeeper Foster is furious at the reaction from the stands to Brunt, who has played more than 250 games for the club over seven years. ‘It is absolutely ridiculous that somebody who has been an incredible servant to this club for such a long time gets that,’ said Foster. ‘He always gives his all and he’s somebody I would always have in the team. It’s not needed. It is really silly. It doesn’t help at all. It’s pathetic, to be honest. ‘Brunty is everything we’re about. He works his socks off.

It’s not nice. ‘You can understand frustration but it’s not like we’re not trying.

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . They used to like a statement at Rangers. Barely a day went by without one. Former director Dave King would say something. Rangers would fire back. Rangers would put out an email. King would respond. It peaked one night in April. At 10pm, King put out some words accusing chief executive Graham Wallace of deceiving shareholders over the club’s finances at the AGM. At 11pm, chairman David Somers responded. By midnight, the rest of us were losing the will to live. Eventually, the lengthy, incessant missives dried up following the arrival of PR consultant Paul Tyrrell, the former Liverpool and Everton PR communications director. Responding to every accusation cheapens the argument. It saps what’s left of the club’s dignity. Rangers have been granted leave to appeal the decision to freeze £620,000 of the club's assets . The elusive Rafat Rizvi could be further involved at Ibrox than is widely acknowledged . But the problem is this. A picture of powerbroker Sandy Easdale leaving a Glasgow restaurant with Rafat Rizvi this week was disturbing and worrying. It cried out for a bold, unambiguous statement. An assurance to supporters that Rizvi had nothing to do with Rangers and that the club wanted no dealings with a convicted fraudster sought by Interpol. What came instead was, frankly, unbelievable. The public relations equivalent of the dog ate my homework. A UK subject, Rizvi is wanted on charges of money laundering, corruption and fraud against the Bank Century. Sentenced by Indonesian courts in absentia to 15 years in prison, he ducks justice by taking refuge in nations with no extradition treaty with Jakarta. Britain is one of them. So it was, then, that he walked, unencumbered, through the streets of Glasgow side by side with Sandy Easdale minutes after a lunch appointment with Malaysian businessmen who may or may not have been here to invest in Rangers. This was surprising for a number of reasons. In an interview with STV last December, Greenock bus tycoon Easdale said on camera he ‘had not had any dealings’ with Rizvi. It may have been true then. It’s not now. From early on Tuesday, rumours swirled around Glasgow of a fleet of black Range Rovers filled with Malaysian businessmen filing into Murray Park followed by suggestions the mysterious, shady figure of Rizvi was in town. When Sportsmail made a check call, a Rangers official denied both claims. There would be a vague acknowledgement later that night that the Malaysians had been in town on a youth development fact-finding mission. It was a non-story, went the party line, nothing to worry about. Until, that is, the pictures of Easdale, Rizvi and the Malaysians the next day told a very different, damaging tale. ‘Mr Rafat Rizvi,’ claimed a Rangers statement in explanation, ‘arrived with the Malaysian delegation without our knowledge. He is an advisor to Mr Bin Ahmad.’ Rangers' boss Ally McCoist has been with the club through relegations and promotions, since 2011 . On the pitch, Rangers are looking for promotion back to the Scottish Premiership . On a number of levels, this was mind-blowing stuff. Charles Green claims of a Dallas Cowboys tie-up were more credible. If a club from the Far East was keen to study best practice in the field of youth-development set-up, would they really choose Rangers as their role models? A club whose conveyor belt can be summed up by the words Lewis and Macleod? The further notion of Rizvi, a lurking, villainesque figure in this saga, as a youth development middle man is equally improbable. Rizvi’s fortune is estimated at £600million. It’s legitimate to ask why a man of that wealth would be a ‘middle man’ for anyone. The last time Rizvi’s name came to light was in the court battle between Rangers liquidators BDO and Craig Whyte’s lawyers Collyer Bristow earlier this year. Judge Mr Justice Newey ruled that furtive tape recordings of former directors Imran Ahmad and Brian Stockbridge openly discussing Rizvi’s role in the club were admissible as evidence. Ahmad — the latest opportunist to pocket a wedge of the club’s cash — is heard telling Stockbridge ‘there’s no paper trails’ linking Rizvi to Rangers. He adds: ‘There’s no connection.’ This week’s pictures changed all that. It was right there, on the front of a national newspaper. As subtle and menacing as a cybernat zealot with a broken caps lock key. Rafat Rizvi is not only connected to Rangers. That image created the impression of a man up to his neck in the brown stuff stinking out Ibrox. Is it really a mere coincidence that, two years after his links with Green and Ahmad were revealed, Rizvi is suddenly back on the scene? Could it be that this outlaw of Indonesian justice knows far more about the shady, faceless institutional investors behind the Ibrox scenes than anyone lets on? Or that some of the £5.5million Charles Green used to front up the purchase of the club’s assets in May 2012, might have had Rizvi’s grubby fingerprints on the notes all along? That’s the clarifying statement people wanted from Rangers this week. The one statement, you suspect, which will never come.

"By . Daniel Mills for Daily Mail Australia . Australia's men's basketball team have had their world cup campaign turned on its head after they were accused of deliberately losing to Angola. The third-round match against their less-fancied rivals took a stunning turn  late in the third quarter when the Boomers seemingly gave up hope - letting a 15-point lead slip out of reach - to go down by 91-83. The stunning eight-point loss puts the Boomers in a position to avoid playing America in the world cup quarter final and many believe this was incentive enough for the team to 'tank' against Angola. Scroll down for video . Angola's forward Eduardo Mingas  vies with Australia's forward Cameron Bairstow . Australia's Brock Motum fends off Angola's Eduardo Mingas . A number of star players were rested from the Boomers squad in the third round . Angola celebrating winning their game against Australia in the third round of the world cup . Jubilant Angolan supporters enjoy the eight point win in the game against Australia . A dejected Australian bench watch on as the side comes to terms with losing . Australia were in contention to run away with the game when they led by 15 in the third quarter . Boomers coach Andrej Lemanis said suggestions of tanking were ridiculous and defended Australia as a nation that competes in the interest of fair play. 'We always, as Australians, compete the right way,' he said. When asked whether he accepted that some Australians would view the loss with an air of scepticism, Lemanis said: 'People will make up their own minds.' 'There's always going to be speculators. I can't control what people think.' The Boomers were chasing a fourth straight victory for the first time in World Cup history, and for most of the match were cruising before the wheels fell off. Guard Chris Goulding shot a team-high 22 points as the Boomers opened up a 15-point buffer. It was also an opportunity to see highly-rated No.5 NBA draft pick Dante Exum in action, and the 19-year-old didn't disappoint - scoring 12 points and handing out six assists in his 31 minutes on court. Despite fielding a second string team Australia was still the heavily backed favourites at $1.17 . Australia's Dante Exum takes on Angola's  Edson Ndoniema  and Yanik Moreira . Australia's forward Cameron Bairstow shoots from the free foul line . Australia was winning by 15 in the third quarter when the momentum swung in Angola's favour . The loss means Australia will not have to face the US until the semi finals if they win their way there . But an Angolan charge, led by dynamic young star Yanick Moreira's outstanding 38-point display, started midway through the third quarter and they cut the lead to just two at the final break. The onslaught continued thereafter as Australia carelessly gave up the ball, committing 18 turnovers, and played lacklustre defence as the clock wound down in the eight-point loss - prompting the tanking calls. Sports betting agency Sportsbet.com.au refunded $125,500 in bets placed on the Boomers to win the match in light of the allegations. The side was an unbackable $1.17 to win with Angola the $5.20 outsiders. 'Punters bet on the Aussies in good faith not knowing they would be resting a few of their guns and giving their reserves a go, so we think it's only fair that they get their money back to enjoy over the weekend,'  the agency's Shaun Anderson said. In good faith the betting agency refunded the amounts wagered on the match in light of the allegations . Former Boomer Shane Heal defended the tactics and said Australia were well within their right to want the best chance of winning a maiden medal. '[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter. 'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.' 'There's still games to be played that will determine the outcome of the pool. Australia is chasing its first medal in the history of the world cup . Social media users have called the match 'un Australian' A New Zealander likened the tactics to those employed by Australia's cricket side . A defiant Angola stole the game away in the third quarter . When pressed about  allegations of premeditated tanking tactics post match, Lemanis responded: . 'Nobody likes losing. (The loss) doesn't guarantee us third spot . He said the team had 'no control over that game.' 'That was always the case coming in.' Securing third spot would mean Australia would avoid a quarter-final show down against America and conveniently put them in a position to challenge for a maiden medal at the tournament. Former Australian basketball great Shane Heal said  if tanking was on the agenda, it was something that he supported in an effort for the Boomers to win a maiden world cup medal. '[It is] un Australian not to give yourself the best chance to medal,' he wrote on Twitter. 'No medals given on pool placings. Pathway to final 4 is the key.' But most shared a different view to Heal on social media - with one Twitter user comparing the match to Australia's infamous underarm bowling scandal. The strategy employed by the then captain Greg Chappel gave New Zealand no hope of winning when his brother Trevor bowled an underarm ball on the final play of the match. If the Boomers finish third they will play either Lithuania or New Zealand in the quarter-finals.","The Boomers were leading until the wheels fell off in the third quarter .

"By . Laura Paterson . Castle Grant is on the outskirts of Grantown-on-Spey, approximately 155.3 miles from Glasgow and 140 miles from Edinburgh. A Highland castle repossessed from disgraced former Rangers owner Craig Whyte has been sold to a mystery foreign buyer. Castle Grant, on the outskirts of Grantown-on-Spey, was put up for sale at £1.1million in April after the Bank of Scotland seized the property from the businessman . The 15th-century castle was eventually purchased for £1m and is now set for ‘significant investment’ from its new owners, estate agents Strutt and Parker revealed. Kevin Maley, partner at Strutt and Parker’s Inverness office, said ‘Castle Grant was launched to the market in the spring and generated a significant amount of interest from buyers across the globe, including America, Australia, Russia, and Singapore. ‘Interestingly those who did view the castle were fascinated by the history of it and the fact that it was purportedly haunted by the ghost of Lady Barbara Grant, not to mention the misfortune of many previous owners. ‘The new owner is already planning on spending a significant amount on refurbishing the castle and grounds and it reassuring to know that the ancient, ancestral seat of Chiefs of Clan Grant is in safe hands.’ Craig Whyte sold this Highland castle for £1million to a mystery foreign buyer, it has been revealed .

Castle Grant, which has carpeted stairs, is being sold by estate agents Strutt and Parker . Former Rangers chairman Craig Whyte purchased the property with his wife for £720,000 in 2006 . Mr Whyte and his former wife Kim purchased the property for £720,000 in 2006 with a 110 per cent mortgage of £800,000. But Ms Whyte moved out after their marriage fell apart and Mr Whyte reportedly refused to pay the £7,000-a-month mortgage for two years. The Bank of Scotland raised a legal action against him last year and the castle was repossessed in April. Rangers went into administration under Whyte’s ownership in February 2012, just nine months after he had bought the club from Sir David Murray. They were subsequently relegated three tiers from the Scottish Premiership to Scottish League Two due to unpaid debts.

"By . Sean Gallagher for MailOnline . Luton Town are still awaiting their first victory on home soil since returning to the Football League after falling to a narrow 1-0 defeat against Plymouth Argyle at Kenilworth Road. Dominic Blizzard's superb solo goal after the interval was enough to clinch all three points for the visitors, who made it back-to-back wins in the league as a result. In turn after a win at Carlisle on the opening day of the season the Hatters have failed to win since, picking up just two points from their next five league games. Clinical: Dominic Blizzard fires home with aplomb as Plymouth made it back-to-back wins in the league . Euphoria: Blizzard celebrates his all-important second-half goal with team-mate Carl McHugh . Luton: Tyler; Connolly, Griffiths, McNulty, Lacey; Howells, (Lawless 69), Rooney, Guttridge, Ruddock Mpanzu, Drury (Stevenson 78), Cullen (Lafayette 71). Subs not used: Smith,  Wall,  Wilkinson, Justham. Plymouth: McCormick, Mellor, Nelson, Hartley, McHugh, Alessandra, Cox, O’Connor, Blizzard, Banton (Bray 58) (Smalley 70), Reid. Subs not used: Bittner, Purrington, Norburn, Harvey, Thomas. Goals scored: Blizzard 68 . It was the visitors who has the first real goalscoring opportunity of the game when Lewis Alessandra was put through with just Mark Tyler to beat, but his tame effort was comfortably saved by the Luton No 1. Following their lucky escape at the other end the hosts went on to take control of the game, and were mightily unlucky not to take the lead on 29 minutes when Luke McCormick made an impressive save from Luke Guttridge's close range effort. Just before half-time the hosts were again thwarted when Jake Howells looked set to cap off a impressive free-flowing move but McCormick produced another fine save to keep the scoreline goalless. On the move: Luton midfielder Jake Howells looks to get the better of Plymouth's Lewis Alessandra . Disappointing: John Still would have been hoping for a better start to the season for his Luton side . After the break the game turned in the visitors' favour with Dominic Blizzard firing them ahead on 68 minutes with a fierce low-range drive after skipping past numerous Luton players en route to goal. The hosts huffed and puffed as they tried to get back into the game, throwing on forward Ross Lafayette in the closing stages, but ultimately it came to no avail. As a result last year's Conference champions remain firmly poised in the bottom half of the table, with Plymouth moving into the play-off positions with a win ahead of the 3pm kick-offs. Elsewhere in League Two Cheltenham went top of Sky Bet League Two despite their stalemate with Morecambe at the Globe Arena. Last-gasp drama: Sub Adebayo Azeez scores with just seconds remaining to grab a point for AFC Wimbledon . Carlisle and AFC Wimbledon played out a thrilling 4-4 draw at Brunton Park with former Charlton striker Adebayo Azeez coming off the bench to rescue a point for the Dons with an injury-time leveller. Danny Hylton also rescued a point for Oxford as the strugglers hit back at Southend to earn a share of the spoils, with Northampton moving into the play-off positions after Marc Richards' first-half double earned the Cobblers a win at Dagenham & Redbridge. Wycombe maintained their positive start to the season as they played out a 0-0 draw against Bury at Adams Park, as both sides remain in the play-off spots. Exeter also dropped to the summit of the Football League as they lost 2-1 at home to Mansfield, failing to recover from the Stags' two-goal first-half lead after the interval.","Plymouth edged past Luton in a narrow encounter at Kenilworth Road .

"By . Gavin Mccafferty, Press Association . Former Celtic striker Chris Sutton claims the Scottish champions can lift their early-season gloom by going all the way in the Europa League. Sutton was part of the Celtic side which bounced back from a Champions League defeat to Basle by beating the likes of Blackburn and Liverpool on their way to a UEFA Cup final against Porto in 2003. And the Englishman feels there is no reason why Ronny Deila cannot follow in Martin O'Neill's footsteps by leading his team into the latter stages this season. Chris Sutton played for Celtic between 2000-2006, and believes they can win the Europa League this season . Ronny Deila's side have endured a torrid start, but ended a four-straight run of defeats on Saturday . Deila has suffered a torrid start to life at Celtic Park - bowing out of the Champions League against both Legia Warsaw and Maribor after an initial reprieve. But his captain, Scott Brown, returned from a hamstring injury as Celtic ended a four-match run without victory by beating Aberdeen 2-1 on Saturday. And the Norwegian has brought in new recruits such as wingers Aleksandar Tonev and Mubarak Wakaso plus strikers Stefan Scepovic and John Guidetti, although the latter is ineligible for the group stages, which begin for Celtic in Austria this week. Sutton, speaking to promote BT Sport's exclusively live coverage of Salzburg v Celtic on Thursday, said: 'The Europa League has a totally new dimension now with the fact that the winners go straight into the Champions League. Why can't it be Celtic? 'The season has started and things haven't gone to plan in European competition but Celtic can put that right now. They have more options up front now and have pace to counter-attack with Tonev and Mubarak. Deila joined Celtic in June, but has not had an easy start to life in Glasgow . Celtic crashed out of the Champions League after losing at home to Maribor on 26 August . 'Things change quickly in football. There is a bit of doom and gloom about the Champions League now but that's gone now. Celtic could win in the treble and could go on a good run in the Europa League and go on and win it. 'It's hard playing at a big club when results don't go for you but you have to take the flak. It's about being courageous, showing character, and there's nothing that a couple of good results can't turn round.' Sutton recalled how their Champions League defeat by Basle had the unexpected effect of inspiring them to one of the club's most memorable cup runs in 2003. 'At various times at Celtic off the back of bad results, there is nothing worse than the feeling you have in the pit of your stomach after the game,' the former Norwich, Blackburn and Chelsea forward said. Chris Sutton (right) has experienced European success with Celtic, pictured scoring against Lyon in 2003 . Kris Commons celebrates his goal against Aberdeen on Saturday, which helped Celtic end a win-less spell . 'I was lucky, I had managers and team-mates around who felt the same but used that as a motivation to come back and not have that feeling again. 'You stick together, and that's what the players have to do now. They have good players and can go from strength to strength. 'I'm glad (Virgil) van Dijk stayed and Brown has a big impact on the team, and I think they can go from strength to strength. 'It's vitally important for the season. I think this competition is the biggest one Celtic are in. It's the one they can concentrate on. I'm excited by it. I think they can afford to lose games in the league and still win it. 'Albeit they have had a Champions League exit, Ronny Deila has brought in players that will spice up the attacking intentions.'

"By . Phil Cadden . Sam Allardyce has hit back at Mo Diame by claiming his performances at West Ham were not good enough to command a regular first-team spot in his favoured place of centre midfield. New Hull signing Diame, who could make his Tigers debut against his old side in Monday night's Premier League showdown, accused Hammers boss Allardyce of stalling his career and 'shunting' him around the team. But Allardyce responded by insisting Diame's displays at Upton Park did not warrant such treatment. Diame scored goals in big games for West Ham but failed to build on his promising first season at the club . Sam Allardyce was adamant that the player's performances were the reason he failed to hold down his place . Allardyce said: 'It's Mo's opinion, isn't it? He had two seasons with us. We expected him to improve on his first season and he did not go on as far as we expected from there on. 'Mo would have continued to play in centre midfield had his performances continued to be as good as his first season. Those performances didn't quite live up to the ones he gave us in his early part of his career here with us. 'My responsibility is the team and the whole team, not one player. I have to look after 25 players and select the best team. If he wasn't happy and he's moved on then that's fine. Powerful midfielder Mo Diame joined Hull City for £3.5million on transfer deadline day . Diame smashes a goal against Manchester United but was deemed surplus to requirements at Upton Park . 'A player picks himself. A player drops himself - not me. When the performances don't fall to the level you expect then the position is in jeopardy.' Allardyce signed Morgan Amalfitano in a £2million deal from Marseille before allowing Diame to leave for the KC Stadium on deadline day. Allardyce added: 'Mo was running out of contract and we got a fantastic offer from Hull City. He came on a free transfer so we made a handsome profit on the deal. It was good business all round. 'We got Morgan in and Mo got what he wanted - a move and a big contract.' West Ham were linked with Manchester City's Micah Richards on deadline day, but he went to Fiorentina instead. Allardyce continued: 'That's not strictly true. We could not meet the financial demands of Man City.' Enner Valencia is ready to make his first West Ham start in the Premier League against Hull City on Monday night after improving his fitness on international duty with Ecuador. Mo Diame's career had stalled at West Ham and he claimed he had been 'shunted' away from his best position . The £12million striker played 90 minutes against Brazil and scored in a 76-minute outing versus Bolivia on international duty last week. James Collins missed Wales' 2016 European Championship qualifier with Andorra in midweek due to a hamstring injury, but West Ham manager Sam Allardyce confirmed the centre-back is available. Carl Jenkinson (hamstring), Matt Jarvis (thigh), Andy Carroll (ankle) and Kevin Nolan (shoulder) have all started training of some form in their bid to return to the squad, but the trip to the KC Stadium comes too soon for the quartet. There had been suggestions Carroll could return before his scheduled return of November, but Allardyce refused to put a date on his return. Allardyce said: 'Andy has started jogging but I don't want to put a time frame on it. We will be guided by the specialists and we will not take any risks too early.' Allardyce insists West Ham assistant manager Neil McDonald will not be leaving Upton Park despite a link with Carlisle.

"By . Adam Shergold At The Madejski Stadium . Simon Cox bundled home a late winner for Reading as they triumphed in a pulsating clash with Millwall. The Lions had fought back from two goals down thanks to Ricardo Fuller and Mark Beevers but were left heart-broken when Cox turned in Jordan Obita's corner at the back post with just five minutes left. It was a little harsh on Ian Holloway’s side, who once again demonstrated how far they have advanced since last season’s relegation struggles. Simon Cox bundled home a late winner for Reading as they triumphed in a pulsating clash with Millwall . Irish forward Cox scored the opening goal for Reading, it was the Irish forward's third goal of the season . Forward Nick Blackman then doubled reading's lead against Millwall at the Madejski stadium . Jamaican forward Ricardo Fuller pulled one back for the visitors just before half-time .

Scorers: Fuller 39; Beevers 54 . Booked: Webster, Upson . Referee: Keith Hill . Attendance: 15,091 . They refused to lie down after Reading’s lightning-fast start yielded two goals inside the opening quarter-hour and indeed looked favourites to snatch the win for long spells in the second-half. Reading stormed out of the blocks and had the lead after six minutes. It was classic ‘route one’ as Simon Cox chested down Adam Federici’s enormous goal kick, used his body strength to get past Jimmy Abdou and Scott Malone and beat David Forde with a low 25-yard shot. Reading were rampant and from their next assault, Glenn Murray missed a golden opportunity to double the advantage, heading wide from Jordan Obita’s cross with Forde flapping and the entire goal gaping. It didn’t matter as on Reading’s next attack a minute later, Byron Webster tripped Nicky Blackman inside the area and referee Keith Hill pointed to the spot without hesitation. Blackman dusted himself down to send Forde the wrong way from the spot. Millwall had not been without chances. Federici saved from Fuller’s looping header early on and then pulled off a superb double stop to deny Malone with his legs and Scott McDonald’s follow-up with a remarkable reflex action. Nine minutes into the second half, defender Mark Beevers equalised for Ian Holloway's side . Millwall thought they had secured a hard-fought point when Beevers headed home the second half equaliser . Consequently, it was little surprise when Millwall halved the deficit on 39 minutes. Malone marauded down the left, cut inside and fed Fuller, who tucked the ball low past Federici to give the visitors hope before half-time. And the scores could have been level before the break, with Federici stretching his fingertips to push Fuller’s 25-yard shot over the crossbar. Equally, Reading could easily have restored their two-goal cushion when Murray found himself unmarked inside the box, albeit standing in an offside positions, but blazed over anyway. The Millwall momentum continued into the second half and Millwall equalised when Mark Beevers headed in Martyn Woolford’s floated free-kick to the back post after Federici lost flight of the ball.

It was unfortunate for the Australian, who lost track of the deep cross in the floodlights, and rather negated all his excellent work in the first period. The two sides had entered the match with identical records, so it was fitting they found themselves at level pegging. Something had to give and the match swung in the balance as both pressed and probed. Millwall substitute Ed Upson stung the palms of Federici with a blast from 25 yards but it was Cox who had the final say as the Royals pocketed all three points.","Reading beat Millwall 3-2 in Championship match .

"By . Ap  Reporter . The dismissal of Ray Rice wasn't a distraction for the Baltimore Ravens. Ultimately, it served as inspiration. Playing a pivotal divisional game three days after the release of the star running back, Baltimore got a pair of touchdown passes from Joe Flacco and rolled past the Pittsburgh Steelers 26-6 on Thursday night. Owen Daniels of the Baltimore Ravens celebrates his third quarter touchdown during their 26-6 victory over rivals Pittsburgh Steelers on Thursday night . Ravens quarterback Joe Raven greets the fans after his two touchdown passes inspired his team to a comprehensive victory over Pittsburgh . Many Ravens fans in the crowd showed their support for running back Ray Rice, despite him being sacked by the club after a video emerged of him hitting his ex-fiancee . Baltimore wide receiver Steve Smith reaches in vain to reach a touchdown pass during the second quarter at the M&T Bank Stadium . Joe Flacco is held up just short of a touchdown after a hit by Pittsburgh defensive end Cameron Heyward (No 97) during the second half . Rice was reaching the end of a two-game suspension for domestic violence when a video of him striking his then-fiancee surfaced on Monday. By the end of the day, the three-time Pro Bowler had been cut by Baltimore and suspended indefinitely by the NFL. 'We had a tough family situation this week,' coach John Harbaugh said. 'I thought our guys handled it tremendously — with class, with character. They responded.' Coming off a season-opening loss to AFC North foe Cincinnati, the Ravens (1-1) held Pittsburgh to two field goals and forced three turnovers. 'We was all about getting the win. We wanted to kind of give that to Ray,' rookie linebacker C.J. Mosley said. 'We all wish the best for him. Even though he messed up, every man got to go through their mistakes to get better. We wish him the best, but as a team we've just got to keep moving forward.' Bernard Pierce took over for Rice to gain 96 yards on 22 carries as part of a ground game that finished with 157 yards. Flacco went 21 for 29 for 166 yards and two touchdown throws to tight end Owen Daniels, and Justin Tucker kicked four field goals. Quarterback Joe Flacco of Baltimore talks with his opposite number Ben Roethlisberger during a pause in play. Flacco delivered two touchdown passes on the night .

Mosley (right) celebrates a fumble recovery with fellow inside linebacker Daryl Smith as Baltimore seize the initiative in the game . Pittsburgh quarterback Ben Roethlisberger sends the ball during the first half. He completed 22 of 37 passes for a gain of 217 yards . Asked if he was curious how the team would fare after the tumultuous short work week, Baltimore defensive lineman Chris Canty shouted, 'We weren't curious at all. We knew how this was going to go. This was going to go one way, our way, tonight. No question about it.' Pittsburgh (1-1) finished with only 22 fewer yards than Baltimore, but the turnovers made the difference. One Steelers miscue halted their opening drive, another set up a fourth quarter field goal by Tucker, and an interception thrown by Ben Roethlisberger with 1:51 remaining ended any hope. 'Obviously, a disappointing effort for us,' coach Mike Tomlin said. 'A lot of the self-inflicted wounds are going to prevent you from being in a football game like that. We turned the ball over too often [and] were highly penalized. Those two things are a lethal combination.' It was only the second time in the last 11 regular-season meetings between the teams that the outcome was decided by more than three points. Roethlisberger completed 22 of 37 passes for 217 yards. It was the first time since November 26, 2006, that Baltimore held Pittsburgh without a touchdown. 'We moved the ball; we just made a mistake here and there,' Roethlisberger said. Baltimore tight end Owen Daniels manages to hang on to the ball despite pressure from Pittsburgh free safety Mike Mitchell . Owen Daniels celebrates his touchdown after taking in a simple two-yard pass from Joe Flacco following a Ravens move of 85 yards in 12 plays . Baltimore quarterback Joe Flacco assesses his options as he prepares to pass. He completed 21 of 29 passes and gained 166 yards during the contest . After Tucker kicked a 23-yard field goal for a 20-6 lead, Steelers tight end Heath Miller fumbled on a hit by Mosley, who took the loose ball to the Pittsburgh 20. That led to a 22-yarder by Tucker with 11:14 left. Although the Rice video and the reaction were the talk of Baltimore for much of the week, a few fans showed their loyalty to the banished running back by wearing his No. 27 jersey. But the crowd of 71,181 was quick to turn its attention to on-field action at the opening kick-off. Aided by a roughing the passer call against Courtney Upshaw on the third play of the game, Pittsburgh held the ball for more than eight minutes before Justin Brown fumbled and Baltimore recovered at its own 15. The game was played on the 13th anniversary of the September 11 terrorist attacks, with a rousing renditions of the national anthem beforehand .

The Ravens then moved 85 yards in 12 plays with the help of two Pittsburgh penalties, the last a 23-yard pass interference call against Cortez Allen that set up a 2-yard touchdown pass from Flacco to Daniels. Pierce and Justin Forsett combined for 32 yards on Baltimore's next series, which ended in a field goal for a 10-0 lead. Pittsburgh finally broke through with 2:50 left in the half, getting a field goal to end an 11-play, 73-yard drive. It was 10-6 before Flacco connected with Daniels on a 1-yard touchdown pass to cap an 80-yard drive highlighted by Flacco's 24-yard completion to tight end Dennis Pitta.","Joe Flacco threw two touchdown passes for Owen Daniels as Baltimore Ravens beat Pittsburgh Steelers 26-6 .

"By . Rob Davies for the Daily Mail . The plunge in profits at Manchester United looks like a disaster, but that doesn’t tell the whole story.

Cast in that light, this year’s profit of £23.8m looks a lot healthier. Scroll down for video . Manchester United posted profits of £23.8million in their latest financial results . Fans can also take heart from the fact the club pulled in record revenues. But United’s troubles aren’t over just yet. Next year, revenue is expected to fall sharply due to the failure to qualify for the Champions League. A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the campaign under David Moyes is likely to cost the club nearly £50m in lost income. Spending on staff, which includes the cost of signings and salaries, soared by 19 per cent last year. Given the phalanx of high-earning arrivals over the summer, that figure looks likely to rise again. The club will need to be careful it does not live beyond its means for too long, or it could eventually be forced to become a selling club to balance the books.

"By . Carl Markham, Press Association . Former Ryder Cup captain Ian Woosnam was not surprised ex-world number one Luke Donald was left out of Europe's team but admits occasionally decisions are made as much on gut feelings as form. The latter was certainly an issue for Donald, who has registered only one top-10 finish since April, and he lost out in a four-way race with Ian Poulter, Lee Westwood and in-form rookie Stephen Gallacher for the three wildcard spots. Poulter was an almost automatic pick after his inspirational performance at Medinah two years ago, Westwood is playing in his ninth Ryder Cup while Gallacher's recent displays virtually demanded inclusion. Left out: Luke Donald was left out of the 2014 European Ryder Cup team by captain Paul McGinley . Big decision: Europe captain Paul McGinley announces his wildcards to face the United States . Instinct: Ian Woosnam (pictured) believes McGinley will have made a 'gut decision' to omit Luke Donald . On that basis - despite having never lost in four events - it was an easier decision for captain Paul McGinley to leave out Donald. Woosnam had a trickier task in 2006 when he led Europe to victory at the K Club - but not before his captaincy was branded pathetic by Thomas Bjorn after he missed out on a wildcard. At a time when only two wildcards were available he opted for Darren Clarke and Westwood at the expense of the Dane, who qualified for this year's team on merit. He admitted that decision came more down to instinct than anything else. 'It is a shame you have to leave out someone like Luke Donald but that is how it goes, I don't think he's holed enough putts all year to warrant a pick,' Woosnam said. Demanded inclusion: Stephen Gallacher's blistering recent form has earned him a wildcard . Criticism: Dane Thomas Bjorn branded Woosnam pathetic in 2006 for failing to name his as a wildcard . 'In my time I had three people in my mind: it came down to either Thomas Bjorn, Westwood and Clarke and I'd already picked Clarke. 'It was a hard decision but what persuaded me was I felt Westwood would go better with Clarke, especially in the time of grieving Darren was going through (having lost wife Heather to cancer weeks earlier), and everything worked out. 'Lee partnered Darren in two matches and Darren won all his points that week. 'You have a gut feeling, you feel who is going to play well under pressure. Only one celebrating now: Lee Westwood (right) and Donald drink to Ryder Cup success two years ago . 'I think with Thomas at the K Club he had a couple of issues with a hole there (the previous year he drove into water at the 17th three times to run up an 11 to lose the European Open) and that sometimes put bad memories in your head.' Woosnam, an ambassador for bookmaker Betway, said team captaincy was all about man-management. 'When I picked the team on the first day I think I left out Henrik Stenson and Luke Donald and they were whingeing a little bit as to why they were left out,' he added. 'But I went up to them and told them they were playing in the (afternoon) foursomes and that cheered them up then. Glory: Former captain Woosnam led Europe to Ryder Cup victory in 2006 at the K Club . Decisions: Woosnam (right) picked Darren Clarke (left) as one of his wildcards, just week's after his wife died . 'A captain has to get it into their heads quickly that they are all there to win the Ryder Cup. 'All they are is team members, nothing else. You are all as equal as each other, it doesn't matter who wins the points as long as we win as a team.' Woosnam believes the absence from the USA team of 14-time major winner Tiger Woods due to injury will be viewed as a greater boost by the Americans than their counterparts. 'How many times has Woods been in a winning team?' he said. 'I think Europe are fearing more that Woods is not in the team because the USA might be without him. 'The Europeans will be looking at the American team and seeing how they are as unit and how they play together.'

"By . Mark Prigg . Solar flares can cause widespread disruption on Earth, but scientists have struggled to understand how they are formed. Now, a team from from the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) have taken a huge step forward by recreated the phenomenon that leads to solar flares in a lab. They hope their work could lead to improved space weather forecasts. The US team amanged to recreate plasma loops (above) in a lab for the first time. The loops are precursors to the massive solar flares on the surface of the sun can cause electrical storms on earth. 'We're studying how these solar loops work, which contributes to the knowledge of space weather,' says Paul Bellan, professor of applied physics at Caltech, who compares the research to studying hurricanes. 'For example, you can't predict a hurricane unless you know more about the events that precede it, like high-pressure and low-pressure fronts. 'The same is true for solar flares.' The team hope their work could lead to improved warnings of solar storms. 'It takes some time for the plasma to get to Earth from the sun, so it's possible that with more research, we could have up to a two-day warning period for massive solar flares,' said Professor Bellan. The laboratory plasma loop studies were conducted by graduate student Eve Stenson together with Bellan and are reported in the August 13 issue of the journal Physical Review Letters. A strong M3.2 solar flare captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO). NASA's Space Weather Services estimated that it traveled at over 630 miles per second, causing geomagnetic storms on earth . Inside a vacuum chamber, electromagnets create an arched magnetic field. Then, hydrogen and nitrogen gas is released at the two footpoints of the arch. Finally, . a high-voltage electrical current is applied at the footpoints to . ionize the gas and turn it into plasma, which travels at a minimum speed . of about six miles per second. They found that two magnetic forces . control the behavior of arching loops of plasma, which is hot, ionized . gas. 'One force expands the arch radius and so lengthens the loop while . the other continuously injects plasma from both ends into the loop,' Bellan said. 'This latter force injects just the right amount of . plasma to keep the density in the loop constant as it lengthens.' The duo says that in simpler terms, this process is like squeezing toothpaste into a tube from both ends, except that the toothpaste has little magnets in it, so there are magnetic forces acting internally. Stenson and Bellan studied plasma loops that they generated with a pulse-powered, magnetized plasma gun. 'All three steps—the magnetic field, and the gas, and the high voltage—happen in just a flash of light inside the chamber,"" says Stenson. 'We use high-speed cameras with optical filters to capture the behavior of the plasmas.""By color-coding the inflowing plasma, the optical filters vividly demonstrated the flow from the two ends of the loop. According to Bellan, no one has ever used this technique before. On camera, red plasma flows into the loop from one footpoint while blue plasma simultaneously flows into the loop from the other end. The Sun unleasheing a solar flare, which could affect power grids on Earth, as seen by Nasa's Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) 'For each experiment, you'll only see the light from the hydrogen side or the nitrogen side in the images,"" explains Stenson. 'But these experiments are very reproducible, so we can put separate images on top of each other to see both plasmas in one picture.' Next, Bellan's lab will test how two loops interact with each other. 'We want to see if they can merge and form one big loop,' says Bellan. 'Some people believe that this is how larger plasma loops on the sun are formed.'","Team hope to learn more about how flares that can disrupt electricity on earth are formed .

Sporting Lisbon president Bruno de Carvalho has labelled third-party ownership a 'monster that is living in almost all the clubs' following Marcos Rojo's move to Manchester United. Rojo, set to make his debut against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday, left Sporting Lisbon for £16million during the summer transfer window, but was delayed as he awaited a work permit. De Carvalho remains in a feud over the sale, though, as third-party owners Doyen Sports claim they are owed 75 per cent of the transfer fee.

Chelsea have continued their 100 per cent start to the season, the only side in England with such a record, while Louis van Gaal's new-look Manchester United finally recorded a win. Here, EA Sports crunch the numbers to reveal the top 10  Premier League performers from the weekend. It's no surprise that Diego Costa tops the leaderboard after his hat-trick against Swansea but who else makes the top 10 in our Player Performance Index PPI chart? Chelsea's Diego Costa tops Premier League's Player Performance Index after three goals against Swansea . 10. Romelu Lukaku, Everton (PPI score: 34.5) Everton got their season back on track with a comfortable 2-0 victory at The Hawthorns over West Bromwich Albion and Romelu Lukaku starred for Roberto Martinez's men. The big Belgian led the line well and netted a wonderful curling effort from the edge of the box. One goal from three efforts - two of which were on target - is not a bad return at all from the £28million man. Three completed dribbles also contributed to his score. Romelu Lukaku scored a brilliant curling shot for Everton during their 2-0 win over West Bromwich Albion . Big Belgian forward Lukaku also contributed three dribbles as he started to repay some of his £28million fee . The EA Sports PPI is the official player rating index of the  Premier League. It measures a player's contribution to the success of his team. The intention is to remove any opinion bias and only work with proven statistical measurements which become more accurate as the season progresses. So, what are the six indices? 1. Winning performance . 2. Player's performance per match . 3. Appearances . 4. Goals scored . 5. Assists . 6. Clean sheets . 9. Leonardo Ulloa, Leicester City (35.5) Leonardo Ulloa has started life at Leicester City with a bang and he once again popped up with an invaluable goal. The striker's smart finish gave the Foxes all three points against Stoke City at the notoriously tricky Britannia Stadium. As well as his goal, Ulloa completed 19 passes in the opposition half as he menaced the Stoke defence all afternoon. 8. Jack Cork, Southampton (36.0) Unsurprisingly Southampton have three names in the top 10 this week after their 4-0 thrashing of Newcastle United at St Mary's. Jack Cork makes the list after bagging his first goal for the club. Two interceptions and an 88.4 per cent pass-completion rate highlight just how splendid an outing Cork had against the toothless Magpies. Leonardo Ulloa scored the winner for Leicester City as they beat Stoke City 1-0 at the Britannia Stadium . Foxes forward Ulloa applied a sublime finish for his goal and contributed 19 passes in Stoke City's half .

Morgan Schneiderlin, Southampton (36.5) Saints' second entry sees French midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin make the list at No 7 with a score of 36.5. Despite asking to leave the south coast this summer, Schneiderlin has since knuckled down and performed superbly for Southampton, capping off the Saints' victory over Newcastle with a curler into the top corner. The industrious midfielder won seven tackles and completed 91.3 per cent of his passes, giving the visiting side no time to breathe in the middle of the park.

Angel di Maria, Manchester United (38.3) Van Gaal's revolution at Old Trafford is finally taking shape and Angel di Maria is going to be right at the forefront of it. The flying winger scored a goal - albeit somewhat fortuitously from a free-kick that found its way past everyone in the box and into the back of the net - and looked dangerous throughout Manchester United's 4-0 victory over Queens Park Rangers.

He is the third United player in the top 10. The Spaniard's 77 per cent completion rate from 52 attempted passes and his assist show his attacking strengths. But Herrera also won eight tackles, showing he can really get stuck in for United. Ander Herrera scored his first Manchester United goal against Queens Park Rangers on Sunday . Spanish midfielder Herrera won eight tackles and completed 77 per cent of the 52 passes he attempted . 3. Jack Wilshere, Arsenal (44.5) It has been quite a week for Jack Wilshere. First, an impressive display for England in holding midfield and then a rampaging performance in attacking midfield for Arsenal. Wilshere scored a sublime goal during the Gunners' 2-2 draw with Manchester City after completing one of the 10 successful dribbles he recorded on Saturday. An 80 per cent pass-completion rate from 65 attempts is also a decent return. Jack Wilshere was superb for Arsenal during their 2-2 draw with champions Manchester City at the Emirates . England midfielder Wilshere scored a superb goal on the end of one of the 10 successful dribbles he made . 2. Graziano Pelle, Southampton (52) Southampton's third and final player to make the top 10 is the extremely impressive and imposing figure of Graziano Pelle. The Italian forward scored just six minutes into the hammering of Newcastle - and added a second shortly afterwards as he terrorised Fabricio Coloccini and Mike Williamson. Pelle's brace came from just five shots at goal, with three of those finding the target. An excellent conversion rate for any striker.

"By . Derek Lawrenson for the Daily Mail . Large parts of golfing America might still be in denial but Rory McIlroy spelt out the facts regarding long-time superstars Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson in characteristically candid terms on Wednesday. Asked about the absence of both from the field who will contest the season-ending Tour Championship here at East Lake for the first time since 1992, McIlroy responded: ‘I don’t know if I would say their era is over but it is a fact they’re getting older and playing the last few holes of their careers.’ Rory McIlroy  speaks to the media at East Lake Golf Club in Atlanta on Wednesday . How Rory McIlroy or Justin Rose could win the $10 million FedEx bonus … . Rory McIlroy . Will claim that sum if he wins the Tour Championship — not to mention the $1.44m first prize — and has a reasonable chance if he finishes second. A slim chance if he finishes as low as tied third. Justin Rose . Must win the Tour Championship and hope Chris Kirk finishes worse than 21st, Billy Horschel worse than sixth, Bubba Watson worse than fourth, and McIlroy, Hunter Mahan and Jimmy Walker are outside the top three. By the same token, the new poster boy is stepping up to the plate nicely with a very tidy front nine. This season McIlroy has played 16 events that count on the PGA Tour and registered three wins, eight other top 10s and never once finished outside the top 25. He can reflect on a year where he not only won two majors but also addressed the vexed issue of his inconsistency. Now comes the chance to add a little stardust. If he wins this event, with its $1.44million (£890,000) first prize, he will also collect the $10m (£6.18m) bonus for the FedEx Cup. McIlroy caused a few wry chuckles when he described it initially as a ‘nice bit of extra money’. It made you wonder what would be a considerable sum, before he elaborated. ‘It is obviously a lot of money to anyone, but I have been lucky enough to make a lot of money on the PGA Tour,’ he said. ‘One of the few things I haven’t achieved is a FedEx Cup, so that’s the real reason I want to win this week. Rory McIlroy has his sights set on the RedEx Cup and $10m bonus . ‘I just want to finish the year off well. Yes, the money is great, but the title would mean more to me, and after the year I’ve had it would be disappointing not to pull it off. I’ve only got 28 other players to beat here. It’s not like a regular event where you have to beat 155.’ McIlroy, 25, rounded off his time in Denver last week with a visit to Mile High Stadium to watch a little American football in the shape of the Denver Broncos against the Indianapolis Colts. He spent time down on the field and came away sounding like he was glad he played golf for a living. ‘Wow, there are some big boys who play that game,’ he said, shaking his head. ‘The hits. The speed. It’s no surprise to me that two or three guys a game get injured. Some of the wide receivers and the running backs are amazing. To my mind, they’re the most impressive athletes in sport. You have to have it all in that game.’ Rory McIlroy signs autographs during a practice round in Atlanta . The following morning, he was due to fly to Atlanta before having a last-minute change of heart, a re-routing to south Florida and a night at home for the first time in two months. ‘It really is amazing what a night in your own bed can do,’ he said. ‘I stood in the shower in Denver and said to myself, “Why am I going to Atlanta today?” So I got to dump a little luggage that I have been carrying with me the past few weeks, practise at the Bear’s Club nearby and work out at home in the gym. It was a lovely, relaxing day and I come here feeling refreshed.’ If he feels that way after a night in his own bed, Europe’s Ryder Cup captain Paul McGinley must be hoping he opts for seven days at home next week before heading off to Gleneagles, where his workload will almost certainly include five matches. Tiger Woods (above) and Phil Mickelson (below) will not be in Atlanta this week . As for his practice session, did he work on his putting by any chance? ‘Yes, and there were no four putts either,’ he said, smiling, in reference to four-putting the same hole two days running at the BMW Championship last week. ‘It was just a complete anomaly. I can see where I lost concentration on the third putt on Saturday, but on Sunday I grinded on all of them. You just have to write it off as one of those things and hopefully there will be no more this week.’ The other UK representative here is Justin Rose, who can also claim the $10m bonus but only if a complex sequence of events goes his way. ‘I quite like being one of the dark horses because the pressure is on the top guys to finish the job off,’ he argued. ‘I can just go for it, with nothing to lose.’ Even if he doesn’t pull it off, there’s still plenty of FedEx loot to play for, with even the man who finishes fifth in the bonus pool collecting more than $1m. A nice bit of extra money, by any standard.","Rory McIlroy targeting FedEx Cup and $10m (£6.18m) bonus .

The fears over the fate of vultures in Europe and Africa come after populations of the birds, which play an important role as scavengers cleaning up dead wildlife, plummeted by more than 99% in Asia. Asian populations were the victim of a veterinary drug, diclofenac, which is used to treat inflammation in livestock but which is lethally toxic to vultures when they ingest it from carcasses, with numbers plummeting faster than the Dodo before its extinction. At risk: Conservation group, Birdlife International, have warned that vulture populations are plummeting faster than the dodo did before it became extinct (above - griffon vulture in flight in Hoces del Duraton, Spain) Conservation group BirdLife International is warning that the drug is commercially available in at least two European countries - Spain and Italy - both of which are strongholds for vultures in Europe. And vultures in Africa are facing increasing threats, due to accidental and deliberate poisoning, persecution for body parts to be used in traditional medicine, habitat loss and collision with power lines, BirdLife said. Three-quarters of vultures found in the Old World - Europe, Africa and Asia - are threatened or near-threatened with extinction, BirdLife warned. Kariuki Ndanganga, BirdLife Africa’s species programme manager, said: “Unless threats are identified and tackled quickly and effectively, vultures in Africa and Europe could face extinction within our lifetime.” Three-quarters of vultures found in the Old World - Europe, Africa and Asia - are threatened or near-threatened with extinction, according to BirdLife (above - white-backed vultures eat a carcass in Athi Kapiti, Kenya) Jim Lawrence, BirdLife’s preventing extinctions programme manager, said: “We know what to do in Europe - ban veterinary diclofenac. “We also know what we need to do for Africa - urgently understand fully the threats and extinction risk so we can act quickly, with priority.” The conservation charity is calling for support for its campaign to stop vulture poisoning in a bid to tackle the threats the birds face.","Fears for European and African vulture after drug used to treat livestock devastates bird's Asian population .

"By . Mark Teece . The Pittsburgh Steelers and the Baltimore Ravens clash at the M&T Bank Stadium in this AFC North divisional match-up with both teams looking to shake off questionable performances last Sunday. Early in the campaign it may be, but the Steelers have the opportunity to move to 2-0 both this season and in the division, which could prove vital come week 17. On the flip side, the Ravens could be 0-2 both overall and in the division with another loss on Thursday. The Steelers looked to be control against the Cleveland Browns last Sunday. Leading 27-3 at half-time, their defensive frailties that were evident during a pre-season matchup against the fast-paced, no-huddle offense of the Eagles surfaced their ugly head once again. On the march: Ben Roethlisberger's Pittsburgh Steelers are looking to build on their win in week one . Disappointment: Joe Flacco's Ravens suffered a 23-16 defeat by the Cincinnati Bengals on Sunday . The Browns rallied to ensure a frantic finale at Heinz Field, but the Steelers escaped with a 30-27 win. Rookie linebacker Ryan Shazier amassed five tackles on his debut but, as a unit, the run defense of the Steelers will need to improve against the Ravens. Ben Roethlisberger, who is entering his 11th season, threw for 365 yards, one touchdown and an interception against Cleveland, showcasing his unique ability to keep plays alive whilst under duress. Both running back Le'Veon Bell and wideout Antonio Brown continued where they left off last season. Bell rushed for 109 yards and a touchdown from 21 carries, along with six receptions for 88 yards. Brown, meanwhile, reeled in five catches for 116 yards and a touchdown. Second year wideout Marcus Wheaton played an integral part of the final drive that led to the game-winning field goal, reeling in six receptions for 97 yards on Sunday. Nervy: The Steelers held off a Browns comeback as Shaun Suisham kicked a game-winning field goal . Still got it: Steve Smith scored an excellent 80-yard touchdown for Baltimore, but it was in a losing cause . The Ravens, on the other hand, looked miserable during their 23-16 defeat by the Cincinnati Bengals. The offense had a resilient defense to thank for keeping them in the contest as they only allowed the Bengals' to complete just four of 14 third down attempts. Joe Flacco was sacked a career-high 22 times last season as the Ravens stuttered to an 8-8 record. Former Texans head coach Gary Kubiak has been brought in as the new offensive coordinator as the team look to revitalise Flacco back into the pre-big money contract form that took them to the Super Bowl two years ago. Evidently, this is still a work in progress as Flacco attempted 62 passes, completing 35 for a total 345 yards. The offense wasn't helped by a number of dropped passes. Steve Smith, however, continues to defy father time, his 80-yard touchdown on Sunday was the longest of his career to date. Gone: Baltimore released running back Ray Rice after new video footage emerged of him punching his wife . The Ravens moved swiftly on Monday to release Ray Rice from his contract following the emergence of video footage relating to his domestic violence charge during the off-season. Fellow running back Bernard Pierce' struggles were evident, as he totaled just 14 yards from six carries. However, there may still be hope for this Ravens team looking to expose the poor run defense of the Steelers as Justin Forsett rushed for 70 yards and a touchdown off eleven carries.

"By . Press Association Reporter . Wales' matchwinner Gareth Bale emphasised the importance of points rather than performance after their 2-1 Euro 2016 qualifying win against Andorra. Andorra took a shock lead in the sixth minute when Swansea full-back Neil Taylor was adjudged to have pulled the jersey of Ivan Lorenzo in the penalty box, before skipper Ildefons Lima sent Wayne Hennessey the wrong way as the home side scored their first competitive goal for 18 matches. Wales equalised with Bale's header after 22 minutes at the Andorra la Vella before the Real Madrid star won the game with a stunning free-kick 10 minutes from time.

Rare strike: Andorra celebrate after Lima scores his country's first competitive goal since September 2010 . 'To get us off to a good start is massively important for us,' Bale told Sky Sports 5. 'We ourselves have expectations. We want to qualify and if we are to, we have to come to places like this and get victories. '(For the free-kick) I tried to hit the sweet spot and luckily enough I did - the important thing for us was to get it out of the way and get three points.' Wales manager Chris Coleman was delighted with the victory but was highly critical of both the pitch and referee Slavko Vincic. The stadium's artificial 3G surface was only passed fit for use by UEFA last Wednesday after original tests showed the ball was rolling too fast on the pitch. 'They (Andorra) are a fighting nation and when we arrived my heart sunk when we trained on it (the pitch),' he said. 'It shouldn't be played on at our level, the good thing is that we got three points and everyone else has to come here. 'I am delighted with the lads. With the expectation on us, it was never going to be easy - you couldn't run with the ball and we had to gamble at times. It's three points whether we win 1-0 or 3-0. 'There were half a dozen challenges that weren't very good. The ref should have clamped down but he let it go and we are a bit disappointed with that - we had a bit to contend with tonight.'

"By . Ian Parkes, Press Association Sport . Felipe Massa is hoping his luck has finally turned after ending his 26-race drought without a podium in Sunday's Italian Grand Prix. Behind a Mercedes one-two spearheaded by Lewis Hamilton, Massa was the best of the rest, claiming his first top-three spot since joining Williams at the start of this year, and first since the Spanish GP in May last year. The fact it came at Monza, on home soil of Ferrari, a team he spent eight years with prior to switching to Williams, only added to the significance for the 33-year-old Brazilian. Finally: Felipe Massa celebrates his long-overdue podium finish at Monza . In a season when Massa has endured some wretched luck on occasion, and after watching team-mate Valtteri Bottas claim four podium finishes in five grands prix prior to Sunday's race, his result was long overdue. 'I've not been very lucky in some of the races this season,' said Massa. 'But the luck is on our side I'm sure now, and from now to the last race we're going to be there fighting. 'I'm so happy to be on the podium, and there's a lot more to come.' With Bottas fourth, Williams have now leapfrogged Ferrari in the battle for third place in the constructors' championship, and the multi-million pound windfall that would come with that. Third: Massa finished behind Lewis Hamilton (centre) and Nico Rosberg in the Italian Grand Prix . Support: Brazilian flags were among those cheering on the podium finish . It has been a remarkable turnaround this year for Williams who, with 177 points to their name so far this campaign, have scored more this season than in the past four combined since the new scoring system was introduced. Massa added: 'It's amazing to see how Williams were last year and now we are fighting with big teams. 'It's really good for the whole team, and I really hope we can get this third place in the constructors' championship, which would be fantastic for the whole team.' Massa, though, dismissed suggestions his result and performance on Ferrari territory was a message to his former employers. Kiss: Massa salutes the crowd after the race . Tight corner: The Brazilian put in his best performance of the season to seal third place . Rivalry: Valtteri Bottas has been Williams' no.1 this season but Massa outperformed the Finn at Monza . 'I had an incredible time with Ferrari who are in my heart, and they will always be there,' said Massa. 'But I'm not driving for Ferrari any more, we (Williams) are fighting against them, Red Bull, Mercedes, and we need to do everything we can to be in front of them. 'We did a fantastic job to be on the podium, so it's a message we're competitive, that we are there, that we are fighting.'","First podium finish for Massa in 26 F1 races .

"By . Associated Press . Arizona rookie John Brown caught a 13-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Carson Palmer with 2:25 to play to lift the Cardinals to an 18-17 win over the San Diego Chargers on Monday. In the night's other game, Detroit quarterback Matthew Stafford led the Lions to a 35-14 victory over the New York Giants at Ford Field. Arizona had a big advantage in yards in the first two quarters but led only 6-3 through two field goals by rookie kicker Chandler Catanzaro. Decisive: John Brown scored a late touchdown to help Arizona Cardinals beat San Diego Chargers . San Diego quarterback Philip Rivers went 6 for 6 for 82 yards on a drive to open the second half and his six-yard pass to Malcom Floyd for the touchdown put the Chargers ahead 10-6. Jerry Attaochu blocked a punt to help set up that score, and later forced a fumble by Palmer which led to Ryan Mathews running 20 yards for a TD that put San Diego up 17-6. The Cardinals finally got a touchdown on a 10-play, 64-yard drive. Palmer scrambled and then tossed five yards to Stepfan Taylor to cut the lead to 17-12 with 12:30 to play. The two-point conversion try failed. After the ensuing kickoff, the Chargers appeared to be headed for at least a field goal, but a snap bounced off Rivers, and by the time he fell on the ball, San Diego was out of field-goal range. Streaking clear: Ryan Mathews scored a touchdown as San Diego build a 17-6 lead in Glendale . Comeback: Stepfan Taylor's touchdown got Arizona back into the game before they won it late on . The Cardinals took the punt at their 9-yard line with 6:50 to go and mounted the long scoring march that led to the winning score. The 11-play, 91-yard drive culminated with Palmer making a short lateral pass to Brown, who eluded tacklers and made it to the end zone. In Detroit, quarterback Stafford improvised brilliantly on two early touchdown passes to Calvin Johnson, leading the Lions to a comfortable win over the Giants in Jim Caldwell's first game as coach. Stafford also ran for a TD for Detroit, which intercepted Giants quarterback Eli Manning twice. It was a bright start for Detroit, which collapsed late last year and missed the playoffs, prompting the firing of coach Jim Schwartz. Playmaker: Calvin Johnson caught two touchdown passes as Detroit smashed the New York Giants . Eye catching: The Arizona Cardinals cheerleaders perform at the University of Phoenix Stadium . Stafford went 22 of 32 for 346 yards while Johnson had seven catches for 164 yards. Manning was 18 of 33 for 163 yards and a touchdown for the Giants, who started 0-6 last season and have started 2014 in similarly uncompetitive style. Stafford scrambled to his right and threw deep to Johnson on the game's first drive as New York's defensive backs collided, allowing the Lions' star receiver to jog into the end zone for a 67-yard touchdown. Later in the first, Stafford scrambled to his left, and then threw back to his right. Johnson made a diving catch in the back of the end zone for a 16-yard TD and the Lions were in control from then on. Â .","Monday results: New York Giants 14-35 Detroit, San Diego 17-18 Arizona .

"By . Laurie Whitwell for MailOnline . Wales manager Chris Coleman has joked he will ignore any envelopes with Madrid postmarks until after Gareth Bale has played against Andorra. Angel Di Maria claimed Real sent him a letter on the morning of Argentina’s World Cup final asking him not to feature for fear of aggravating a thigh injury. The Spanish giants are understood to have had concerns about Bale playing on Andorra’s new artificial 3G pitch for their Euro 2016 qualifier on Tuesday night but Coleman insists the club have been a pleasure to deal with. Joke: Coleman joked about Di Maria's revelation that Real Madrid asked him not to play in World Cup final . He met Carlo Ancelotti during a trip to watch Bale play against Cordoba in Real’s La Liga opener and will start the 25-year-old, despite their only being four days before the Madrid derby against Atletico. ‘I’ve not had a letter and if there is I'll open it on Wednesday morning,’ Coleman said with a smile. ‘I went there two weeks ago, we had a great welcome. Carlo Ancelotti is magnificent, a fantastic guy, whose achieved special things and shows how to behave. Really accommodating. ‘The medical team there are brilliant, we spoke to them about Gareth and they were great with us. We've never had any obstacles from them.’ Coleman believes Bale, a Champions League winner in his first season at Real, now wants glory with his country and can set an example for others to follow. ‘He's just won the Champions League which is seen as the pinnacle. He's got a taste for that success. Madrid: Coleman said that Real Madrid had always been very accommodating and praised Carlo Ancelotti . ‘It's good for the other lads because they'll talk to him about the Champions League final and what it was like. ‘Gareth will want to play against the best teams and the big games and that is tournament football. To get there (to Euro 2016) we need to take care of business and he'll be a good influence on that. With the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Ashley Williams, and Joe Allen also in the team, Wales have the best chance to make a major tournament for the first time since the 1958 World Cup. Coleman added: ‘I've said it to them when they get labelled the golden generation, think about the teams that have come before you and not done it. ‘Southall, Saunders, Hughes, Rush, Giggs, Speed, more, all in the same team – but they couldn't do it. We have to step up, we know that. ‘It's the first time in two years where we're going into a game with expectation to go on and win. Other games are either 50-50 or we're underdogs. So this is a new experience.’ Opener: Wales face Andorra in their opening European Championships qualifying match .","Angel di Maria said Real Madrid asked him not to play in World Cup final .

South Korean teenager Seung-Woo Lee is currently competing for his country in the Asian Under-16 Championships in Thailand and lit up his country's clash with Malaysia. Picking the ball up just inside Malaysia's half, he wriggles between two players before skipping away from a couple of despairing sliding tackles. Still with plenty to do, Lee lifts the ball over the feet of a fifth Malaysian defender before slamming the ball into the bottom corner on the half volley from just inside the penalty area.

As the Premier League season gets going, Sportsmail looks at players new to the top flight with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. ALBERTO MORENO IN A NUTSHELL . Alberto Moreno was taught a harsh lesson on Monday night against reigning champions Manchester City - don't dawdle or you'll be caught out. It is a lesson every player new to the Premier League must learn and this particular 22-year-old was taught in the cruelest way imaginable, gifting Stevan Jovetic the  opening goal on his debut. Liverpool ultimately lost 3-1, but don't let that deter you from buying the left-back with a winger's soul. Moreno's £12million move to Liverpool from Sevilla, where he once held a 30m euro buy-out clause, remains one full of promise. And you can be sure the Spaniard won't dally on the ball in the box anymore - Brendan Rodgers will be sure of that. Oops: Alberto Moreno looks on as Stevan Jovetic scores the opening goal against Liverpool on Monday night . Mistake: Moreno's error led to the opening goal for City but the defender will have learned a valuable lesson . No dawdling! Moreno is a left-back with a winger's soul and his £12million move to Liverpool is one of potential . Born: Sevilla, Spain, July 5 1992 (age 22) 2011-2013: Sevilla B (49 apps, 8 gls) 2012-2014: Sevilla (45, 3) 2014-NOW: Liverpool (1, 0) 2013-NOW: Spain (3, 0) WHAT WILL MORENO BRING TO MY TEAM? Points. Simple as that. The defender is at Liverpool, a team determined to show their title surge last year was not a fluke. And Rodgers is a man who knows bidding to become champions starts at the back, which means clean-sheets galore for those of you willing to spend £5.6m on the 5ft 7in Spaniard. Granted, Moreno made a mistake in his first-ever Premier League game but still held a 90.5 per cent pass completion rate against arguably the toughest opponents in the top division. Last year at Sevilla, he chipped in with three La Liga goals and began to average a shot a game. Will he up his accuracy at Anfield? It may be worth a shot... Debutant: Moreno was taught a harsh lesson on Monday evening against reigning champions  City . Potential: Moreno once held a 30m euro buy-out clause at Sevilla and has started to show an attacking side . At £5.6m, Moreno is a steal. That's cheaper than a host of players who may not even make it into their side's starting XIs! CLICK HERE TO BUY MORENO FOR £5.6M . STOP SUGAR-COATING IT - HOW WILL HE GET ME POINTS? An appearance earns you two points - check. A win earns you three more - check. A clean-sheet will add another four - check. It'll add up week in, week out when it comes to a player of Moreno's quality. And lest we forget, a goal from the defender adds 10 every time! He found his shooting boots last season in La Liga so he will come to England full of confidence to nab the occasional goal. BUT CAN HE HANDLE THE PREMIER LEAGUE? Two years ago Moreno was a Sevilla reserve player. He beat off competition to become a first-team regular, earned three caps for Spain along the way, and is now at Liverpool. Quite the transition in just two short years for the 22-year-old, who clearly has potential in his locker. Adjustment time is always needed - that's a given - but Moreno won't be alone in settling in. Former U21 team-mate and friend David de Gea is just a short drive away, as is Alvaro Negredo. And if they don't feel like a chat in his native tongue, his new manager Rodgers speaks fluent Spanish. Adding up: A goal from the defender adds 10 points every time and Moreno found his shooting boots last year . Ready: Moreno will come to England full of confidence to nab the occasional goal, particularly in front of the Kop . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT... If ever you need convincing that Moreno has a place tied down in the Liverpool starting XI, then Rodgers is here to put your mind at ease. '(Moreno) has got huge potential,' Rodgers told Liverpool's official website. 'He's a really exciting young player. When you watch him, he's very attack-minded, very quick and he serves the ball really well. 'At 22, he's hungry to succeed. He has got improvements to make but he's one of the players we've brought in this summer who is ready to play straight away. 'We had a practice game here last week and he looked very good. He's one who is coming straight out of La Liga. He's come from the Europa League champions. 'He's done great. Last season he was one of the top left-backs in Europe and was highly sought after. He's a boy that will fit well into our way of working.' Instructions: Moreno was a Sevilla reserve player two years ago but upped the ranks and was capped for Spain . I'M NOT SURE... CAN HE HANDLE IT? He will thrive off Anfield. Some players might shy away from the intense atmosphere - not Moreno. He’s a football fan who grew up watching a Sevilla side that won back-to-back UEFA Cups and two Spanish Cups six-to-seven years ago under Juande Ramos. He stood on the stands of the Sanchez Pizjuan and cheered on Alves and Co as a teenager. He knows what those in the Kop and surrounding stands want to see, and will endeavour to bring it.

"By . Richard Arrowsmith for MailOnline . Samir Nasri claims Chelsea and Manchester United will provide the greatest threat to Manchester City this season, but has played down Liverpool's chances of mounting another title challenge. Brendan Rodgers' side came within two points of winning the Premier League title last season, but the French midfielder believes that the Reds return to the Champions League will see them struggle this term. 'Liverpool will find it tougher because they have lost Luis Suarez and they will be playing Champions League football so it will be different for them,' he told the City matchday programme.

Joy of Cesc: The arrival of Nasri's former teammate Cesc Fabregas has strengthened Chelsea . 'Last season they only had the Premier League to go for in the final months and it gave them a real advantage because their players were going into games fresher at a vital stage of the campaign.' Despite finishing 22 points above their neighbours last season, and already being four points ahead of them this campaign, Nasri still rates United as challengers along with Jose Mourinho's new look side. 'I think our two main rivals will be Chelsea and Manchester United. 'Chelsea have made some good signings and Cesc Fabregas will be the guy to replace Frank Lampard. He is a great player, I know that because I was with him at Arsenal. 'Chelsea had a weakness up front last year but have signed Diego Costa. They will be really dangerous. Dutch of class? Nasri sees Manchester United as challengers despite Louis van Gaal still seeking a first win . Afterthought: Alexis Sanchez (L) could bring Arsenal into the mix according to the French midfielder . 'United have a new coach, have strengthened as well and don't have any European competition -- so I expect them to come back stronger, too.' The 27-year-old also commented, almost as an afterthought, on his former club Arsenal's chances.

MailOnline's Fantasy Football season has started in earnest, but there is still time to change your team. We will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. FRASER FORSTER IN A NUTSHELL . Forster has been at the heart of everything that Celtic have achieved over the past five seasons and he will hope to continue that success on the south coast with new club Southampton. Having signed for Ronald Koeman's side in a £10million deal earlier in August, the England international has gone straight into Southampton's side as their No 1 goalkeeper. The 26-year-old is big - he stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall - and he is a huge presence in goal, filling out the frame and intimidating opposition strikers. He made his Premier League bow for Southampton against Liverpool on Sunday and, although he was beaten twice, he looked composed and relaxed in his new environment. Ready? Fraser Forster has signed for Southampton from Celtic and will test himself in the Premier League . Record: Forster (right) has kept an incredible 127 clean sheets in 251 career appearances and is only 26 . Born: Hexham, England, March 17 1988 (age 26) Height: 6'7"" Position: Goalkeeper . Club: Southampton . Previous clubs: Newcastle United, Stockport County, Bristol Rovers, Norwich City, Celtic . 2008-09: Stockport County (loan, seven appearances, three clean sheets) 2009-10: Bristol Rovers (loan, four appearances, two clean sheets), Norwich City (loan, 42 appearances, 20 clean sheets) 2010-12: Celtic (loan, 91 appearances, 50 clean sheets) 2012-15: Celtic (106 appearances, 52 clean sheets) CLUB RECORD 2013-14 . Appearances: 51 . Clean Sheets: 27 . Clean Sheet Ratio: 1.9 games per CS . WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE FORSTER IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Forster is a relative newcomer to the Premier League, but he has bags of experience having played more than 250 club matches and having been capped twice by England. He has kept an incredible 127 clean sheets in 251 matches for Stockport County, Bristol Rovers, Norwich City and Celtic since making his debut in 2008. That is better than a one in every two-game ratio. Although life may be somewhat tougher in the Premier League with a team who are likely to finish in the middle of the table rather than at a club who won the Scottish league at a canter, Forster's record at every side he has every represented suggests he will bag points on a regular basis. At just £5.1m in our game, he appears to be a bargain. CLEAN SHEET KING . It is easy to dismiss Forster as only having done well at Celtic because they won the league without being stretched - but his record is still phenomenal. Last season, Forster set a Scottish Premiership record of 1,256 minutes without conceding a goal and racked up 27 clean sheets in 51 appearances. It is irrelevant what level he was playing at. That is an exceptional achievement. Presence: Forster stands at an imposing 6ft 7in tall and really fills out the frame of the goal he defends . BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? Because, if his record is anything to go by, he will keep clean sheets. Yes, Southampton have lost their main defender in Dejan Lovren, but they have a solid unit and Forster performed reasonably well in the Saints' 2-1 loss to Liverpool. Southampton will face easier tasks than a trip to Anfield, and Forster is bound to pick up points for making some big saves too. He also has Champions League experience with Celtic which can only leave him in good stead. New surroundings: Forster (left) has played in the Champions League and brings some experience to Saints . International: Forster has been capped twice by England and was part of Roy Hodgson's World Cup squad . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Southampton boss Ronald Koeman has been full of praise for Forster since he signed him and he expects big things from the England international. 'It's a big challenge to play in the Premier League but it's easier to be first choice for England,' Koeman said. 'He's got a good personality. He's very tall. If you see him in goal you'd think it's difficult to beat him. He's also a very good passer,' Koeman said in The Sun. Goalkeeping legend Pat Bonner, meanwhile, also lauded the stopper after he broke the Scottish Premiership record for minutes without conceding. He said: 'What Fraser has achieved has been just incredible - it's a remarkable achievement and all credit to him. 'I've spoken recently about how quick he is for a big goalkeeper.

As MailOnline's Fantasy Football season gets underway, we take a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. CARLOS SANCHEZ IN A NUTSHELL . The tough-tackling midfielder considers Chelsea legend Claude Makelele as his hero and there are similarities in the way Sanchez approaches games. He gained the nickname La Roca (The Rock) early on in his career due to the strength of his tackling and the tenacious manner in which he hunts for possession. Not fazed: Sanchez made his debut for Villa as a second-half substitute against Newcastle on Saturday . Born: Quibdo, Colombia - February 6, 1986 . Position: Defensive midfield . Career stats: . 2005–2007: River Plate Montevideo 40 appearances, 1 goal . 2007–2013: Valenciennes 178 apps, 10 goals . 2013–2014: Elche 30 apps, 0 goals . 2014-: Aston Villa 1 app, 0 goals . International stats: . 48 appearances, 0 goals . WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE SANCHEZ IN YOUR  FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Sanchez was crucial for Colombia in qualifying for the World Cup in Brazil, and featured in four of their five games at the tournament including their quarter-final defeat to the hosts. The 28-year-old will win tackles galore for Villa this season, and though he offers little in terms of a goal threat, his side will benefit defensively from his presence in front of the backline. THE GAME HE PROVED HIS WORTH IN . Sanchez did a brilliant man-marking job on Lionel Messi when Colombia played Argentina in the Copa America in 2011, stopping the diminutive No 10 from influencing the game or getting on the scoresheet. Making a name for himself: The 28-year-old moved to the Premier League from Spanish side Elche . Mixing it with the best: Sanchez tussles for possession with Barcelona star Lionel Messi in La Liga . BUT HOW WILL HE PICK UP POINTS? Villa conceded the fourth highest number of goals in the Premier League last season (61) and Lambert made it a priority to strengthen his squad defensively before the start of the new campaign. Sanchez's role will be to shield the Villa defence and stop them leaking so many goals over the course of the season, which should help propel them up the league. He will pick up points for every win and draw that Villa pick up. All smiles: Sanchez looks delighted to be at Villa during training ahead of their draw against Newcastle . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Villa boss Paul Lambert was full of praise for the midfielder after he completed his move to the Midlands . 'It was well documented that we were on the lookout for a defensive midfielder,' he said. 'I've watched a lot of his games to see if he fitted the bill and after seeing him once in training I realised that we have got a proper player on our hands.' 'He has not done much training since the World Cup but I think if you look at the World Cup and that Colombia team, he was someone that really captured the attention the way he played and fitted in that system. 'I know I have got a really top player on my hands here.' Pedigree: Sanchez has played 48 times for Colombia and was part of Jose Pekerman's World Cup squad . HE'S A BETTER, CHEAPER VERSION OF... Victor Wanyama . Southampton midfielder Wanyama started his Premier League career well following his move from Celtic last year, but has influence has since waned, making his Fantasy Football price of £6.4million fairly high. The exodus from the St Mary's this summer has not helped the Kenya international and he has been linked with a move to Arsenal before the transfer window slams shut. On the wane: Victor Wanyama has failed to live up to the hype after a decent start to life at Southampton .","Aston Villa signed Carlos Sanchez from Elche for £4.7million .
Sanchez has the physical toughness and aerial ability to be an asset for Paul Lambert's side in the Premier League this season .

"By BEN NAGLE FOR MAILONLINE . France commence their early preparations for hosting Euro 2016 without four familiar faces after international retirements affected the general make-up of Didier Deschamps' squad. Goalkeeper Mickael Landreau, defender Eric Abidal and midfielders Franck Ribery and Samir Nasri have all called time on their careers with Les Bleus, two years before the European Championships come to France. 'They are in charge of their careers, and I must try to understand their decisions,' Deschamps told L'Equipe. 'The important thing is that we have players who want to wear the blue shirt. That desire must come from them.' Mickael Landreau (left) and Eric Abidal (right) have both retired from international football . Manchester City midfielder Samir Nasri (far) has retired from international football, whereas Newcastle's Remy Cabella (near) is just beginning his international career . Franck Ribery has also called a halt to his time in Les Bleu, after making 80 appearances for his country . The changes mean a clutch of younger or less established players including Eliaquim Mangala, Lucas Digne, Morgan Schneiderlin, Remy Cabella and Loic Remy have a chance to impress Deschamps over the next fortnight. A friendly meeting with Spain in Paris on September 4 precedes an away match against Serbia on September 7 - the first of 10 'centralised friendlies' that must be played against the nations in qualifying Group I. There is no place for Arsenal's injured striker Olivier Giroud but his Gunners team-mates Mathieu Debuchy and Laurent Koscielny are included. Mangala and Bakary Sagna represent English champions Manchester City. Newcastle boast two members in the squad - Cabella and Moussa Sissoko - and Hugo Lloris flies the flag for Tottenham, with Remy of QPR also called up. Paris St Germain duo Yohan Cabaye and Blaise Matuidi are the star names from Ligue 1, but in-form Marseille hitman Andre-Pierre Gignac has been omitted. Florian Thauvin, Dimitri Payet, Sebastien Corchia, Layvin Kurzawa and Wissam Ben Yedder are among the other promising France-based players who have been overlooked on this occasion. Goalkeepers: Lloris (Tottenham), Mandanda (Marseille), Ruffier (St Etienne) Defenders: Debuchy (Arsenal); Digne (Paris St Germain), Evra (Juventus), Koscielny (Arsenal), Mangala (Manchester City), Sagna (Manchester City), Sakho (Liverpool), Varane (Real Madrid) Midfielders: Cabaye (Paris St Germain), Matuidi (Paris St Germain), Mavuba (Lille), Pogba (Juventus), Schneiderlin (Southampton) Sissoko (Newcastle) Forwards: Benzema (Real Madrid), Cabella (Newcastle), Griezmann (Atletico Madrid), Lacazette (Lyon), Remy (QPR), Valbuena (Dynamo Moscow)","Goalkeeper Landreau and defender Abidal have retired from French duty .

As part of the build-up to the start of MailOnline's Fantasy Football season, we will be taking a look at players new to the Premier League with the potential to light up England's top tier over the coming campaign. BAFETIMBI GOMIS IN A NUTSHELL . It is extremely rare for a club to get a proven goalscorer on a free transfer, but that is exactly what Swansea City have achieved with the signing of Bafetimbi Gomis on a four-year deal. The striker's contract had expired at Ligue 1 side Lyon and, despite being a long-term target of Newcastle United, Swansea took advantage of the uncertainty over his situation and brought him to South Wales. With 12 France caps and three international goals, Gomis' talents have been utilised on the big stage and he is a big, bulky forward who also has pace. The 29-year-old can hold the ball up, although his touch is not necessarily his strong point, and he knows where the goal is. Gomis is perfect at leading the line and is a danger particularly in the air, but also on the deck. Bargain: Swansea City striker Bafetimbi Gomis will cost you just £6.9million in MailOnline's Fantasy Football . Power: Gomis is a big centre forward who can hold the ball up well, but he is also pacey in attack . Last season Gomis scored 14 goals in 33 Ligue 1 appearances for Lyon. That is a strike-rate of a goal every 2.35 games, which is a decent ratio for the French league. With only three yellow cards last season, his disciplinary record is also decent for a big forward. The striker averages 2.4 shots per game and he wins 1.7 aerial duels a match. WHY YOU SHOULD HAVE GOMIS IN YOUR MAILONLINE FANTASY FOOTBALL TEAM . Gomis is never going to set the world alight and he is unlikely to be right at the top of the goalscoring charts with season - but he is a bargain at £6.9million in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game because he will accrue points. With 14 goals in the league for Lyon last season he has proven he can find the net. Goals are like gold-dust in Fantasy Football and so Gomis will guarantee you points. As a second or third striker option he is ideal because he will regularly gather points for your side. His disciplinary record is also decent enough, with just three bookings last season, meaning he is unlikely to regularly lose you points due to him being red-carded or cautioned. Gomis could end up forming a formidable partnership with fellow Swans hitman Wilfried Bony up top, meaning he should keep gathering points along the way all season. European quality: Gomis has scored regularly in Ligue 1 and the Champions League for Lyon . Prolific: Gomis scored 14 goals in 33 Ligue 1 games for Lyon last season - a strike every 2.35 games . THE GAME IN WHICH GOMIS PROVED HIS WORTH . Gomis has taken to life at the Liberty Stadium like a Swan to water, with two goals in his pre-season campaign. His first strike came against Exeter City and it was a trademark Bafetimbi Gomis goal. Full-back Neil Taylor lofted in a excellent ball and Gomis rose well to power a header home from close range, . The French international also netted away to Reading with a goal that showed both his pace and class in front of goal. He launched a run in behind the Royals defence and capitalised on a poor back pass. After racing towards goal with the ball, he put Swansea 2-0 up with a delicate chip over the advancing goalkeeper. He has already started to adapt to life in English football, and more goals are sure to follow. Delicate: Gomis has scored twice in pre-season, including showing his subtler side with a chip vs Reading . Competitive: Gomis is tall and good in the air - he scored a bullet header against Exeter during pre-season . DON'T JUST TAKE OUR WORD FOR IT . Swansea manager Garry Monk seems delighted to have recruited the former Saint-Etienne man. He believes the forward's experience at the top level will make him a success in the Premier League. 'It's a fantastic signing; a very big and important signing for the club,' said Monk. 'I'm very happy,' he said, 'You are talking about a quality striker who has played international, Champions League and top flight football in France for a big club. 'It shows just how far we have come that we can attract a player of his quality. 'He's a player that can excite the crowd, make and score goals. He's always done that wherever he's been - and that's what we want him to keep doing here. 'We want him to be an important cog in the squad and help us to continue building.' Aggressive: Gomis (in blue) competes for the ball in the air during a Ligue 1 match for Lyon against Lorient . HE'S CHEAP FOR A PROVEN GOALSCORER . At £6.9m in MailOnline's Fantasy Football game, Gomis is extremely cheap for someone proven to score  goals at the top level. Incredibly, he is the 57th most expensive striker, yet his stats should be that of a top-20 player. He will not top the charts but he will give great returns as a second or third striker. You want to budget well and Gomis is a bargain who can accompany some of your more expensive forwards. Here are just some of the strikers who Gomis is cheaper than: . Jonathan Walters (Stoke City) - £8.3m . Fabio Borini (Liverpool) - £8.1m . Dwight Gayle (Crystal Palace) - £7.8m . Arouna Kone (Everton) - £7.6m . Ayoze Perez (Newcastle United) - £7.5m . Cheap: There are 56 strikers who will cost you more than Gomis yet he is almost sure to get your points .","Gomis signed a four-year deal at Liberty Stadium and signed as free transfer .

"By . Dominic King for the Daily Mail . Follow @@DominicKing_DM . Stevan Jovetic and Sergio Aguero tormented Liverpool as Manchester City made a bold early statement in title race. As Mario Balotelli watched on from the Directors’ Box, Brendan Rodgers will have been left to wonder whether his new £16million signing will lift Liverpool to City’s level. Jovetic scored either side of half-time to take the game away from Liverpool, with substitute Sergio Aguero coming off the bench to finish Liverpool off with his first touch, as City ran out convincing 3-1 winners at The Etihad Stadium. Hero: Stevan Jovetic scored twice on Monday night to help City to a 3-1 win over Liverpool . Injuries ruined Jovetic’s first season in Manchester but he has come back this season in good heart, thriving during City’s pre-season tour. It led Manuel Pellegrini to hail the Montenegrin’s performance and the manager insisted he will play a major role in City’s quest for honours this season. Pellegrini said: ‘We are pleased with Stevan, he is working hard. He was unlucky last season but we never had any doubt of his quality. He deserved to start the season as he has done. We need four strikers and at this moment Stevan is doing really well. ‘We don’t forget Alvaro Negredo, who was important last year but is injured. It is important that we have four strikers. When you play at home it is very important to play well against a team like Liverpool. They will be challenging for the title. Pellegrini, who insisted that the injury which forced Edin Dzeko off was nothing too serious, added: ‘We are just starting the season we had a very hard start and it was very important for us to win the second game. One up: Jovetic smashes home the opener just before the break as Alberto Moreno looks on . 'For me these are games of six points – especially when you play at home. For Jovetic to start the season in this way after an unlucky new season is good’ Rodgers, whose side pulled back a late consolation when Pablo Zabaleta put past Joe Hart under pressure from Rickie Lambert, accepts signing Balotelli is 'a calculated risk' and has warned the 24-year-old this is his last chance to thrive at elite level. But the Liverpool manager, while irked by some of his team’s defending, does not believe this was setback will be too costly. He warned, though, that the club’s £117million spending spree is no guarantee that they will be successful. ‘I think that the market for strikers of that quality (is tough) and the deal was very good,’ said Rodgers. ‘He is a world class talent and it is an area that we needed to strengthen. Hopefully we can help him improve as a player and a man. I think he can do very well for us. Slotted home: Jovetic started and finished a move for the second goal, with the assist from Samir Nasri . ‘I don’t have any concerns. We know he is a football talent. There is no big-time Charlies in this squad. He knows that he needs to fit in to this squad. One thing he doesn’t lack is confidence. He has that football arrogance. Luis has gone, he brilliant for me for two years but we move on. ‘I have been very encouraged by him. He knows he has got flaws. There is no better club. Liverpool is a wonderful club. He has already sampled how we work. The goals we are disappointed with. The first one we were not alert. You have to complement their finishing. Rodgers added: ‘You buy players but it does not guarantee you anything. I thought up until they scored we were the better side. We looked good going forward. But we switched off before half-time. We started the second half reasonably bright but then gave away poor goals. ‘For the new players, it should be reasonable quick. There is a period of adaptation. We have still got the core and the players will adapt in. It will take a bit of time. Alberto Moreno showed flashes of his quality. We knew there were areas we need to work on.

"By . Ben Nagle For Mailonline . Paul Scholes has claimed that Manchester City's 3-1 rout over Liverpool on Monday night is proof that they can win the Champions League. Scholes tipped City to compete with the very best in Europe this season, and labelled Monday's victory as confirmation of City's intent. 'Watching Manchester City on Monday night, the scale of the club’s ambitions was clear for anyone to see. They do not just want to be champions of England; this is a squad built to win the Champions League, too,' Scholes told The Independent in his weekly column. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City players celebrating title in their dressing room . Goal: Stevan Jovetic scores the opening goal for Manchester City on Monday night . Rout: An 'ambitious' City side celebrate their third goal against last season's runners-up Liverpool . Main man: Jovetic, who only played 13 Premier League games for City last season, has started with a flourish . Scholes, a United man by his own admission, admits City look good enough to win the Champions League . City's 3-1 victory over last season's runners-up Liverpool ensured a maximum six points for the champions, and leaves them well-placed going into a tough September, where they face a difficult trip to Arsenal, before hosting Jose Mourinho's Chelsea at the Etihad. On Monday, a brace from Stevan Jovetic, followed by a killer blow from Sergio Aguero just 23 seconds after entering the field as a substitute, was enough to secure the win, and Scholes believes that their strength in depth is perhaps their strongest quality. 'The most daunting aspect of it all was when Jovetic scored his second and the camera panned over to the bench.' 'The substitutes in shot were Sergio Aguero, Fernandinho and Jesus Navas – it reminded me what an incredible squad Manuel Pellegrini has at his disposal. There are 22 proper, top-class footballers at that club, and they can compete with the very best in Europe.' Scholes, who by his own admission is United through and through, also cites City's diversity in player style as a title-winning combination. Yaya Toure and David Silva are very different players - little and large, by all accounts - but the way Pellegrini has the team working as a unit will surely run them close to the Premier League title again. 'City were sensational at times against Liverpool. All good sides have a mixture of qualities and City have the guile of Samir Nasri and David Silva combined with the pace and power of Yaya Touré. Alongside Touré is Fernando, a variation on Fernandinho, whom I also like.'","Manchester City beat Liverpool 3-1 on Monday night .

"By . Nick Harris for MailOnline . Stevan Jovetic lit up the Etihad Stadium on Monday evening, giving an eye-catching all-round performance for Manchester City that merited his two goals in the 3-1 win over Liverpool and easily deserved his man of the match award. But if you think the 24-year-old Montenegro striker is now destined to be a leading scorer as City romp to the Premier League title, his career to date suggests you better think again. Any strike force is only as strong as its weakest link, and there is no doubt Jovetic remains City’s weakest link among the first-team squad’s four strikers: Sergio Aguero, Edin Dzeko and Alvaro Negredo being the others. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Pellegrini hail Jovetic . Weakest link: Stevan Jovetic is a decent player but won't fire Manchester City to the title . Superstar: Sergio Aguero slots the ball home seconds after coming on against Liverpool . The real deal: Aguero is the main man at City and theit title hopes will hinge on his form and fitness . Jovetic is evidently a decent ‘weak link.’ He pounced in predatory fashion upon Alberto Moreno’s 41st-minute error to open the scoring last night. Then at the end of a superb second-half move involving 19 passes and an exquisite final exchange with Samir Nasri, he drilled home for 2-0. But one delicious double, or even a few, spaced out, does not a superstar make. Jovetic scored a Champions League brace against Liverpool for Fiorentina in 2009 and is arguably still yet to have a sustained run of top-level consistency, five years later. So while City’s manager Manuel Pellegrini was right  to describe Jovetic, signed in summer 2013 for £22m, as a ‘very important player’, and to stress ‘we never had any doubt about his quality’, he was also right to qualify his statements, saying: ‘If he’s fit all the year, he will be a very important player for us.’ In two of the past four seasons Jovetic has spent much or all of the season injured. He missed the whole of the 2010-11 campaign for Fiorentina with an injury to the cruciate ligament in his right knee. In his debut year with City last season, he made just three league starts (among 13 appearances) as he was variously sidelined with knocks, illness, calf and shin problems and two separate hamstring lay-offs. Strike one: Jovetic hammers in City's opening goal against Liverpool on Monday night . Doubling up: The Montenegro forward (left) makes it two with a good finish in the second half . Stevan's stunner: How Jovetic scored his superb second goal against Liverpool . As a prodigious youngster, Jovetic first played league football for Partizan aged 16 in 2006 and scored his first hat-trick at 17. But starting young means Jovetic’s career already has longevity; this is his 10th season as professional footballer and he has never scored more than 14 league goals in any season. He’s scored league goals in double figures in just three seasons, one of those as a teenager with Partizan. The 14-goal season was with Fiorentina in 2011-12 in a campaign where Jovetic was the leading striker, and main man, but it was a disrupted year of multiple managerial changes and ended with a 15th-place finish in Serie A. Monday night’s goals were significant, and in a major game. As Pellegrini said: ‘Liverpool are an important team and one that will be fighting for the title.’ But Jovetic’s three Premier League goals last season, his only three before Monday, were less cases of shooting down major rivals as shooting fish in barrels. Put your shirt on him: Jovetic celebrates a rare Premier League goal last season, against Aston Villa . Bench boy: Jovetic (right) was familiar in his role as a substitute last season . His first goal came in a 5-1 win at 10-man Tottenham, and was the fourth goal of the five. His second goal was in a 4-1 win against Southampton, the fourth goal. His third goal was in a 4-0 win against Aston Villa, the third goal. All were scored with Jovetic in the substitute role, and of course it is not his fault that he was not on the pitch earlier in those games. Having said that, in the pecking order of scorers, Jovetic is very much City’s fourth striker in hard numbers. In all competitions last season, Aguero scored 28 goals in 34 games at a rate of 0.82 per game to make him City’s hottest striker. By the same goals-per-game reckoning (see table below), Dzeko and Negredo were both ahead of Jovetic, as was midfielder Yaya Toure. Taking only league games into consideration, and using the goals-per-game method so as not to penalise players used infrequently, Jovetic was not only behind Aguero, Toure, Dzeko and Negredo but also David Silva. Down the list: Jovetic was the bottom of City's strikers in terms of goals per game last season . International class: The forward captaining Montenegro against England in a World Cup qualifier last year . Announcing himself: A young Jovetic slots the ball past Liverpool's Pepe Reina in 2009 and (below) celebrates . And if you think it is unfair to compare Jovetic to others over one injury-hit season, how does he fare when you compare him over several years against Aguero, Dzeko and Negredo? The answer, in pure goal terms, is he comes fourth of four, whether in terms of goals per game or minutes per goal, in the three full seasons (plus this season) since Jovetic’s full missed season in 2010-11. (See table below). So his relative lack of goals cannot be put down to the fact that he only gets on the pitch for short times. Aguero’s record of one league goal every 113 minutes for three years is stunning; Jovetic’s tally of one every 168 minutes, including last nights two in 80, is fine but not sensational. Having said all that, Jovetic is not a main striker, he is a support striker, as much creator and provider as converter of chances. His problem will be how often he gets into the team when the others are all fit, because while he’s a decent player, he’s not a title-sealer, yet. Propping them up: Jovetic does not come out well when record over the last three seasons are compared .","Stevan Jovetic will never score enough goals to fire City to the title .

"By . Phil Blanche, Press Association Sport . Wales manager Chris Coleman believes his young side are ready to deliver at last - but he would still take a 1-0 victory in the tiny football outpost of Andorra on Tuesday night. The rise of Real Madrid superstar Gareth Bale and Arsenal playmaker Aaron Ramsey, not to mention a healthy sprinkling of solid Premier League performers, has taken expectation levels in Wales to new heights as Coleman's squad start out on the road to Euro 2016. Wales have not qualified for a major tournament since the 1958 World Cup finals and the current side, dubbed the 'Golden Generation' by some, have had their fair share of setbacks during their development. But Coleman feels he has the talent at his disposal to challenge group favourites Belgium and Bosnia-Herzegovina for the automatic two qualifying spots, let alone make the play-offs by finishing third in a section which also includes Israel, Cyprus and Andorra. Ready to impress: Gareth Bale (third from right) spearheads Wales against Andorra on Tuesday . Optimistic and realistic: Coach Chris Coleman is confident his side will impress, but will take a 1-0 result . 'There's a reason why people talk so highly of the group because it's true that when we're at our best we are a good side,' Coleman said ahead of Wales' first Group B test high in the Pyrenees. 'I sense the expectation and two years ago I would have been wary of it. I'm not now and I won't shy away from it. 'We have to take it as a compliment and deal with it, and if we do that we'll do the business. 'Belgium and Bosnia are the top teams and then it's the other four, but we have a chance to put pressure on those two. 'I don't want to go at it thinking there's a possibility of a play-off. Let's go for the top two, that's what we have to aim for.' Front man: Bale is tipped to start at centre-forward for his country rather than his customary wide left position . Andorra are ranked 199 in the world and their statistics do not make impressive reading: they have won only one competitive game since their introduction to world football in 1998, not collected a single point in Euro qualifying and not managed a competitive goal for four years. But on the plus side they tend not to suffer heavy defeats and the Netherlands struggled to a 2-0 victory in Andorra during 2014 World Cup qualifying. 'We're not going to into the game thinking about we're going to win it this way, we just want the win and I'd take 1-0,' Coleman said.

"By . Eleanor Crooks . Serena Williams has finally succeeded in taking the pressure off herself at a grand slam and is two matches away from a third successive US Open title. The world number one had a sensational season in 2013, winning 78 matches and losing just four, but two of those defeats came unexpectedly at grand slams. Williams' phenomenal success everywhere else made up for it but this season underperforming at slams has become a trend. Relaxed: Serena Williams believes she can play without pressure as she aims to retain her US Open title . She was beaten in the fourth round at the Australian Open by Ana Ivanovic, slumped to a miserable defeat against Garbine Muguruza in the second round of the French Open and then went out in the third round at Wimbledon to Alize Cornet. The common thread was how tight and nervous Williams looked, the pressure both internal and external clearly a major hindrance. The US Open is the 32-year-old's last chance this season to get to 18 slam singles titles, the same mark as Chris Evert and Martina Navratilova. Determined: Williams is after a third successive US Open title having struggled in the Grand Slams this season . Agitated: The American has appeared to shows signs of pressure this year as she chases an 18th Grand Slam . Champion: Williams is the reigning champion at Flushing Meadows and already has five US Open titles . Williams said with a laugh that the number 18 meant 'legal and legendary' to her, and she revealed seeing the funny side of this season had helped her relax. 'It's so easy now because it's almost a joke for me because I have done little to no winning in the majors,' she said. 'And I thought, ""Take it as a joke. Oh my God, I'm past the fourth round. Woo"". I better play doubles just in case I don't make it past the second round. At least I have a back-up plan.' Williams has stayed cool and projected an air of control throughout her five matches so far, never dropping more than three games in any set. Against Flavia Pennetta in the quarter-finals she was 3-0 down but responded with a run of six games in a row. Challenger: 17th seed Ekaterina Makarova, in her first singles semi-final at a slam, is Williams' opponent . In the last four she meets another player yet to drop a set, Russian Ekaterina Makarova. The 17th seed, who is into her first singles semi-final at a slam, has the distinction of being the only left-hander to beat Williams at a major. That was in Australia in 2012, but Makarova has already tasted victory over her opponent this tournament in doubles, and she and fellow Russian Elena Vesnina are through to the women's doubles final. Williams has won their other three singles meetings, including in Dubai earlier this year, and is looking forward to the challenge. She said: 'I have played two lefties already and I often practice with (fellow American) Varvara (Lepchenko). She's a lefty. I think that's been good for me, so I'm ready for the lefty. 'I think it will be a good match. She's beaten me before. I am obviously going to go in there and just try to do the best I can. Other side: Former World number one Caroline Wozniacki is hoping to repeat her run to the final in 2009 . 'Makarova moves well. She doesn't care who she plays, she gives 100 per cent. Those types of players are often difficult to play because it makes them better. She has a lot of momentum going into this match as well.' The other semi-final pits Williams' great friend Caroline Wozniacki against Chinese surprise package Peng Shuai, who is another first-time slam semi-finalist. Wozniacki has been here before but not for three years, while her only slam final came in New York in 2009. The Dane enjoyed a prodigious rise up the rankings as a teenager and was ranked number one in the world by the time she was 20. But the last three years have been a story of underperforming at the slams and endless questions about her game and whether it is aggressive enough. Surprise package: China's Peng Shuai has shocked the draw by reaching the semi-finals against Wozniacki . In March this year she dropped to a low of 18 in the rankings but, coincidentally or not, since the split from fiance Rory McIlroy in May she has reached a different level. Wozniacki refuses to link the two and has simply referred to her 'up and down' year, but something is certainly driving the 24-year-old on like never before. She produced arguably the performance of her career to upset Maria Sharapova in the fourth round and then thrashed Sara Errani to reach the last four. 'I just listen to myself and my coach,' she said. 'I always try to work hard and try and be better. You always try and add to your game. You have to, because everyone knows how you play. 'It will always go up and down in sports. I'm just happy I'm on my way up again and I'm playing well. 'I have proven people wrong so many times. I was told when I was younger there is no chance I will make the top 100, top 50, top 30. Every time I have proven them wrong. It's kind of nice.'","32-year-old has 17 Grand Slams from a glittering career .

"By . Chris Wheeler for The Mail on Sunday . CLICK HERE for all facts, stats and graphics from the big match at the Etihad Stadium . When Mame Biram Diouf received the ball midway inside his own half, even he could not have dreamt how it would end. David Silva’s corner had been headed clear by Marc Wilson after 58 minutes and the big Senegal striker was under pressure from Aleksandar Kolarov. Diouf turned the Serbian and set off optimistically towards the Manchester City goal with very little support from his team-mates. Substitute Fernandinho positioned himself in Diouf’s path, hoping no doubt to hinder his progress, but he was left looking rather foolish as the former Manchester United striker simply accelerated past the stationary Brazilian. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini on creative struggle vs Stoke and transfer rumours . Jumping for joy: Mame Biram Diouf scored a brilliant goal on the counter attack as Stoke stunned Manchester City at the Etihad Stadium .

Still, it appeared as though he had taken the ball too wide of goal as Kolarov raced back to block the shot, but suddenly the ball was flying off his right boot and through the legs of goalkeeper Joe Hart. It was Diouf’s first goal since joining Stoke City this summer, and a wonderful one at that. City were stunned. Stoke could hardly believe it themselves, and with good reason. To appreciate the magnitude of this result, you have only to consider the statistics. Stoke had lost on all six of their previous Premier League visits to the Etihad, failing to score so much as a single goal. The aggregate score was 15-0. City, on the other hand, only lost once here in the league throughout last season and that was to Chelsea. The two defeats mark the only occasions on which they have failed to score in 71 home league games. The champions will claim that they should have had one, possibly two, penalties in the second half after the ball ricocheted off Phil Bardsley and struck Wilson on the hand from close range before Yaya Toure was brought down by Erik Pieters towards the end. ‘All of you know that it was a clear penalty,’ said City manager Manuel Pellegrini of the second incident. However, Stoke had a decent appeal of their own turned down by referee Lee Mason in the first half when Diouf tangled with Kolarov and then went down under the defender’s untidy challenge. ‘People are saying that theirs was a good call for a penalty but I saw the one that we should have had in the first half,’ said Stoke manager Mark Hughes. The Welshman has not enjoyed the happiest of returns to the Etihad since he was unceremoniously sacked in 2009. The best of it was a point with Fulham. Even beating relegation with QPR was tainted by having to see his successor, Roberto Mancini, snatch the title on the last day of the season. Pellegrini managed it in his first season in England but the Chilean will be concerned at his team’s lethargy at times on Saturday. They lacked the cutting edge that saw off Liverpool so convincingly last Monday, creating only a handful of chances that fell to the wasteful Toure. Finish: Diouf slotted past Joe Hart after a swift counter attack as Manchester City suffered a rare home defeat in the Premier League . Decisive: Fernandinho watches on as Hart is beaten by Diouf's shot which was enough to earn victory for Stoke .

Despite the attacking options available to him, Pellegrini acknowledged that he now has 48 hours before the transfer window closes to add to his squad. Whether that involves AS Monaco striker Radamel Falcao remains to be seen. But City were held at bay too easily here by a Stoke side with two stubborn banks of four and a typically tenacious attitude aimed at knocking their opponents out of their stride. The game was only a few minutes old when Sergio Aguero went down and stayed there after colliding with Ryan Shawcross as he spun past the Stoke skipper. Bardsley was booked for going through the back of Silva who then clashed with Shawcross and was more than happy to see Stevan Jovetic go into battle with the big defender on his behalf. City also lost Fernando before half-time when their new £14million signing limped off with a groin injury following a challenge with Glenn Whelan.

Despondent: The loss ended Manchester City's 100 per cent start the season after the champions beat Newcastle and Liverpool . Their best chance arrived in stoppage time at the end of the half when Aguero twisted and turned around the penalty box before releasing Kolarov on the overlap. The Serbian’s low cross picked out Toure who met it with a first-time effort with his left foot that clipped Asmir Begovic’s bar. Toure had two more good chances in the second half, one of which brought the reflex save from Begovic, and one that led indirectly to Stoke’s winning goal on the counter attack. They had to do more than their fair share of defending to keep the lead and it wasn’t particularly pretty. But Hughes is slowly introducing the passing game that persuaded his employers to choose him as Tony Pulis’s replacement, and at times they looked almost comfortable against the Premier League Champions. ‘We’re Stoke City, we’re passing the ball,’ sang their supporters as the Potters played their way out of trouble in the dying minutes.

"Forward Jonathan Walters scored twice and made a late third for Peter Crouch to ease Stoke into the third round of the Capital One Cup as on-loan Chelsea winger Victor Moses enjoyed a promising debut against Portsmouth at the Britannia Stadium. While the prospect of seeing Moses - who had not started a club game since scoring for Liverpool in an FA Cup fourth round tie at Bournemouth in January - for the first time hardly enticed the locals to the game in their droves, there were some encouraging elements to be seen in a 3-0 victory.

Aside from some threatening runs from the Nigeria international the display by Marc Muniesa at left-back, one of nine changes from Sunday's Premier League draw at Hull, was another positive as was the late debut handed to 16-year-old academy graduate Oliver Shenton. Former Barcelona B defender Muniesa produced some inviting crosses from the flank, one which resulted in Walters' opener and others which could have brought more. But most of the attention was on Moses and how he would perform having been farmed out on loan again by Jose Mourinho. Last season he began his spell at Anfield looking like he had something to prove but quickly faded and by the end was nothing more than a bit-part player. Manager Mark Hughes has promised the 23-year-old he will get much more pitch time under him and on the evidence of his first man-of-the-match performance he is unlikely to have to wait until the next round of this competition for another go. He could have capped his debut with a goal on the hour but fired into the side-netting with only goalkeeper Paul Jones to beat. Acrobatic: Peter Crouch of Stoke City has a shot on goal against Portsmouth . On the run: Stoke City's Victor Moses takes on Nick Awford of Portsmouth . The league cup may be of secondary consequence to Premier League sides but Portsmouth, second in League Two a mere 54 places below their hosts, also seemed less than interested with eight changes of their own. Without the squad depth of their opponents it was always likely to affect them more and the first half saw Stoke create a number of chances - many via the left boot of Muniesa - but convert only one. With Pompey's defence almost obsessed with the aerial threat of Crouch - who could easily have had a hat-trick himself - midfielder Johnny Ertl dropped deep to get a hold of the striker's shirt and Walters slipped in almost unnoticed to turn in Muniesa's cross. Either of Moses or Crouch should have made it 2-0 immediately as the former's shot was parried by Jones who gratefully claimed the rebounded effort. Up for it: Peter Crouch heads at goal in front of a completely empty stand . Chances continued to fall to Walters, Crouch, Moses, Charlie Adam and Robert Huth, the latter denied by Jones who stuck up a hand to and claim the loose ball with the Britannia already celebrating a goal. Two minutes after the break Moses' speed took him clear down the left and his cross presented Walters, who has been linked with a move away from the Britannia Stadium after falling down the pecking order, with the easiest of tap-ins before a charging Jones denied his hat-trick attempt. Pompey's resistance was broken as Crouch twice headed wide via crosses from either flank, Moses fired into side-netting before his debut was ended after 63 minutes and Adam shot straight at the goalkeeper. Stoke's goalkeeper Jack Butland, making only his fifth appearance since joining from Birmingham for £4million in January 2013, tipped over Andy Barcham's shot from a rare Portsmouth attack before Crouch finally got on the scoresheet with a header in the 90th minute.

"By . Riath Al-Samarrai for MailOnline . Follow @@riathalsam . Swansea City have signed Tottenham’s Tom Carroll on loan for the remainder of the season. The England Under 21 midfielder will be available for Saturday’s Barclays Premier League fixture against Burnley. Swansea manager Garry Monk was keen to strengthen his midfield options with knee injuries currently keeping out the vastly influential Leon Briton, out for three-to-four weeks, as well as Jay Fulton. Loan star: Tom Carroll has joined Swansea City on a season-long loan from Tottenham . The 22-year-old has made 23 appearances for Tottenham. He enjoyed his best spell under Andre Villas-Boas, where he featured 14 times in the Premier League, Europa League, FA Cup and League Cup. Last season, Carroll featured in both legs of Spurs’ Europa League victories over Dinamo Tbilisi before joining Queens Park Rangers on loan, making 26 appearances as the London club won the Championship play-off final. Swansea manager Garry Monk believes he has more quality to call on this season - but admits he does need extra bodies to bolster his squad. Monk drafted in Gylfi Sigurdsson, Lukasz Fabianski, Bafetimbi Gomis, Jefferson Montero and Marvin Emnes over the summer and on Wednesday captured Argentina defender Federico Fernandez from Napoli for a fee understood to be around the £8million mark. Gaining experience: Carroll spent last season on loan at QPR in the Championship . But Swansea were also depleted as Ben Davies and Michel Vorm left for Tottenham, loan signing Jonathan de Guzman headed for Napoli and the Spanish quartet of Michu, Pablo Hernandez, Chico Flores and Alejandro Pozuelo were among the other players who left. 'It is different to last season. We had 25-26 senior professionals last season and now I have five or six of the Under 21s in my squad,' Monk said ahead of newly-promoted Burnley's trip to the Liberty Stadium on Saturday. 'So in terms of that there is a big difference, but in terms of the players we can bring on, it is better. 'There were players we have got rid of from last season and the players we have brought in I believe are better players. 'That is how I feel, but in terms of numbers of senior professionals we do need two or three players. 'We are in a very tough league that gets better every year and you have to add quality every year and get a group that is good together. 'It has been a mammoth effort from everyone involved this summer to put these things in place on the budget we have, but at this moment we have worked it well.' Monk points to the signing of Fernandez as a symbol of the shrewd business Swansea have done this summer, the 25-year-old centre-half having been a World Cup starter for Argentina in Brazil before injury struck. Incoming: Swansea completed the £8million signing of Federico Fernandez during the week from Napoli . 'He is an Argentina international, has played at a very high level with Napoli and was highly considered over there,' Monk said. 'It's important we try and improve the quality all the time and he fits our profile. 'He is a good ball-playing centre-half, he is a good size and suits the way we play. Hopefully he can adapt as quick as possible and offer us the quality he obviously possesses. 'The Premier League is an eye-opener for everyone, but you don't play for the sides he has played for without being physical. 'Coming through in Argentina is very physical, they are a tough people naturally and he should suit us well. 'It's now about getting him up to full fitness as he had an extended break after the World Cup, more than some of our other players like Ki (Sung-yeung) and (Wilfried) Bony, as they reached the final.' Swansea shocked Manchester United on the opening day of the season to win a league match at Old Trafford for the first time in their history. Sign when you're winning: Swansea boss Garry Monk still wants to add players to his squad despite Gylfi Sigurdsson's (above) strike helping the Jacks to a 2-1 win at Manchester United on the opening day . Since then Monk has spent the week telling his players not to underestimate Burnley opponents who lost their opening game 3-1 at home to Chelsea. 'There is a concern which is why I've stressed to them, I'm conscious we know how important it is to follow up,' Monk said. 'There's no guarantees but if we can get preparations as best as possible it gives you a chance of delivering a performance you're happy with and can win a game. 'Burnley will be a hard working team. They are together, work for each other and can be a threat. 'I watched the Chelsea game, they started well and got their goal but this is the difference at this level when you come up against players of their standards. 'There is always a chance they can turn it on and play their best which they did, but I thought Burnley did very well.'","Tom Carroll has joined Swansea City on season-long loan from Tottenham .

"By . Press Association Reporter . Billy Horschel won his second PGA Tour event and catapulted himself into FedEx Cup contention with victory at the BMW Championship in Denver. Horschel finished with a steady round of 69 to leave him 14 under for the week and two shots clear of Bubba Watson who recorded a third consecutive round of 66. The American is now second in the FedEx Cup rankings going into next week's Tour Championship with Chris Kirk, winner of the Deutsche Bank Championship last week, leading the way. Pose: Billy Horschel won his second PGA Tour event and catapulted himself into FedEx Cup contention . That'll do! Victory at the BMW Championship in Denver helped Horschel become one of the favourites to win . Horschel was in a good position to win that tournament last week, but ended up in a share of second and was glad to get a modicum of redemption. 'It just means a lot,' he told Sky Sports 4. 'I haven't had the greatest season and I had my game (on Sunday). 'I couldn't have had a better warm-up session this morning and I played the first couple of holes good and then I was just grinding it and I made some big putts. I can rely on my putter because I'm a good putter inside 10 feet. 'This feels good. Obviously after last week a lot of people on Twitter and out there wanted to call me a choker. I didn't choke, I just hit a bad swing at the wrong time. I was coming from behind, you don't choke coming from behind. 'To lead this thing, to have the three-shot lead, to hold on, means a lot.' The 27-year-old is now hoping he can take some momentum into next week as he aims for the 10million US dollar (£6.1million) bonus that comes with wining the FedEx Cup. 'My form is really good, I'm putting good, I'm doing a lot of good things well,' he added. 'I've got my teacher Todd Anderson coming into town and I'm just going to clean up a couple of things. Impressive: Horschel finished with a steady round of 69 to leave him 14 under for the week and two shots clear . Chase: The American is now second in the FedEx Cup rankings going into next week's Tour Championship . 'I like the way I'm playing. I'm a momentum player and if I can just keep what I've been doing this week and the last two weeks, who knows what's going to happen?' Horschel had three birdies and two bogeys on the front nine, but came home in nine pars to hold off Watson who had six birdies and two bogeys. Morgan Hoffmann was a shot further back after following up Saturday's 62 with a 63 to fire himself into the top 30 of the FedEx Cup rankings and earn himself a place in Atlanta next week. Ryan Palmer was the only other player who started the week outside of that group to muscle his way in and he finished with a 71 to sit two shots behind Hoffman alongside Jim Furyk, Sergio Garcia and Rickie Fowler. 'I'm really excited,' he said. 'More excited about being in all the majors next year. It's been a dream of mine to be in the Masters so I'm really pumped.' Coming into the closing stages, it looked as if Garcia was going to be Horschel's closest challenger after reaching the turn in 29 and picking up a further shot to stand on the 17th tee just two shots behind. But the Spaniard put his fourth shot from behind the green into the water and could not get up and down from the resulting drop to leave him with a triple-bogey eight. World number one Rory McIlroy, who heads to Atlanta fourth in the rankings, was a further shot back alongside Adam Scott and Jordan Spieth after shooting a 66. Keegan Bradley withdrew from the tournament on Saturday and saw himself drop out of the top 30 while defending champion Henrik Stenson did not do enough to get himself through to next week. Decent!

"By . Phil Casey, Press Association . American David Lipsky won his first European Tour title on Sunday after an extraordinary finish to the Omega European Masters in Switzerland. Lipsky almost holed his approach to the 18th hole to card a closing 65 and force a play-off with England's Graeme Storm after the pair finished tied on 18 under par at Crans-sur-Sierre. They returned to the 18th for the first extra hole and the tournament looked to be over when Storm's drive missed the fairway and finished up against a wall, close to a plaque commemorating the place from where the late Seve Ballesteros pulled off a miraculous escape on his way to victory in 1993. Winner: David Lipsky  poses with the trophy after the final round of the Omega European Masters . Storm did not appear optimistic of repeating the feat, the 36-year-old saying to his caddie: 'Oh well, never mind, it wasn't meant to be,' before pitching out sideways. Lipsky had just 86 yards to the hole from a fairway bunker but did not even attempt to go for the green, a decision described as 'heartless' by former European Tour player Wayne Riley, commentating for Sky Sports. However, Lipsky had the last laugh as he pitched out left of the water guarding the front of the green and then chipped to two feet and holed for a winning par after Storm missed from long range. Chin scratcher: Graeme Storm was trying to escape from an awful spot during the play-off at Crans-sur-Sierre . Seve's spot: Storm's escape route brought back memories of the late, great Ballesteros . The 26-year-old, who usually plays on the Asian Tour and won in Cambodia in 2012, said: 'It feels spectacular. I've put in a lot of hard work and have been playing well the last couple of weeks and to put it all together this week is very special to me.' Asked by Riley why he chose to lay-up on the play-off hole, Lipsky added on Sky Sports 4: 'I was just debating in my head the worst-case possibilities and scenarios. 'It was a tough shot out of the bunker and with Graeme only going to make par at best, I decided not to risk going in the water. In the end it was the right play.' Storm, whose only previous European Tour win came in the French Open in 2007, held a one-shot overnight lead and made the ideal start with birdies at the first two holes, but then three-putted from the front edge of the fourth green for a bogey. That allowed Lipsky to draw level thanks to a tap-in eagle on the reachable par-four seventh and from then on the tournament was wide open with four players briefly tied for the lead on the back nine. Storm and playing partner Brooks Koepka edged ahead with birdies on the 15th, but Koepka bogeyed the 17th after his approach plugged in a greenside bunker. That looked set to give Storm a crucial advantage playing the last, but Lipsky in the group ahead saw his approach almost spin into the hole to set up a birdie which eventually forced extra holes. Second place lifted Storm from 159th on the Race to Dubai to 64th and completed a memorable weekend after he won a £100,000 sports car for a hole-in-one on the 11th in the third round. Bailed out: Lipsky found a bunker with his tee shot while Storm struggled, but chose to play safe . Odd route: The American chose a strange method to score the par he needed to wrap up victory . Last laugh: Lipsky emerged victorious at the beautiful venue in Switzerland . 'It's tough to take right now,' Storm said. 'I didn't have much time between finishing my final round and starting the play-off, so I probably wasn't as composed as I should have been. 'But overall it's been an unbelievable week. Obviously I would've loved to have won here this week, and it may take a little while to get over the disappointment, but on the plus side I've secured my card for next season and that has been the goal the last few weeks. 'I was a bit disappointed to have left my birdie putt on the last in regulation so short, but I didn't know David had birdied the last to get to 18 under or else I might have gone for the flag and given myself a better chance of making birdie.' Koepka finished joint third alongside England's Tyrrell Hatton, with Danny Willett and Tommy Fleetwood another shot back in fifth, Willett's 63 the best round of the day. France's Romain Wattel finished joint ninth on 13 under after a 65 which included a hole-in-one on the 11th. 'I saw the crowd were celebrating but I didn't know if that was because it was close, or in the hole. Then I realised, but I didn't know if there was a prize,' Wattel said. 'Richard Green told me I'd won the car, but I thought it was only for the first hole-in-one, and unfortunately I was right.'","David Lipsky won the Omega European Masters at Crans-sur-Sierre .

"By . Derek Lawrenson for MailOnline . Even a total golfing novice would fancy their chances of getting down in three putts from 4ft yet incredibly it proved beyond the best player in the world at the BMW Championship on Saturday. Two majors this summer plus two other notable triumphs proved no protection when Rory McIlroy stood over his four footer for a par at the par three 12th – and ended up walking off the green with a triple bogey six. The 25-year-old powered the first putt 6ft past the hole and was so disgusted when that putt lipped out he lost concentration completely and missed the consequent tiddler as well. Miss: Rory McIlroy missed a four-foot put at the BMW Championship in Cherry Hills . Disappointing: The world No 1 carded a triple bogey on the 12th after missing the put . Only in golf can the very best sometimes be reduced to hapless performers like the rest of us. McIlroy did respond with a birdie at the next but couldn’t repair the damage and had to settle for a 72 that has left him nine shots behind the leader, American Billy Horschel, who shot a fabulous 63. ‘What happened at the 12th completely derailed me,’ admitted McIlroy. ‘I misread the first one, hit a bad putt with the second one and then just lost concentration going for the tap-in. So obviously, from being right there in the tournament, dropping three shots in one hole wasn’t what I wanted.’ After all the great rounds McIlroy has played this summer – this was only his second round over par out of the last 22 – it looked like it all caught up with him a touch here, in his eighth tournament in the last ten weeks. At the next par three, the 15th, he hit a wicked hook with a five iron you’d never see him play if he was fresh, and had to play his next from within the confines of a hazard to card another bogey. Concentration: Rory McIlroy admitted that the missed put on the 12th derailed him slightly . The good news for McIlroy is he is still in great shape in terms of the $10million (£6.12m) FedEx Cup bonus that will be handed out in Atlanta next Sunday at the Tour Championship. Any player who is in the top five in the FedEx Cup going into that event has control of their own destiny and McIlroy should be one of those. ‘I need to go out and shoot a low one in the final round on Sunday and give myself the best possible chance going to Atlanta,’ he said. McIlroy wasn’t the only player to suffer on the greens. Halfway leader Sergio Garcia had problems of his own, missing no fewer than five putts under 5ft in a miserable 72 that has left him seven off the pace. Instead it is US Open Champion Martin Kaymer who leads the European challenge into the final round, as he shot a 64 to stand five behind Horschel in third place. Nearest player to the runaway leader is American Ryan Palmer but even he is three behind. Given this was Horschel’s seventh consecutive round in the 60s – he’s a combined 26 under for the stretch and was runner-up in the Deutsche Bank Championship last Monday – he might take some stopping. Championship: McIlroy dropped seven places to tenth and is now four-under in the BMW Championship . Tournaments: The Northern Irishman has already won two major trophies this summer . ‘I’d have to rate this round as one of the top three of my career,’ said the temperamental Horschel, who has one other PGA Tour victory to his name. ‘I felt like I was in control of all facets of my game all day.’ On a day when his supposed dream team of Phil Mickelson and Keegan Bradley pulled out in controversial circumstances, US Ryder Cup captain Tom Watson will be encouraged that several of his team have the chance to pull off a morale-boosting win going into the final round. Masters champion Bubba Watson is four behind, with Rickie Fowler six off the pace, while Jim Furyk and Jordan Spieth lie joint seventh, albeit eight behind. Justin Rose shot 70 to be tied 29th, while Graeme McDowell shot 69, his lowest round of the week, but still remains in tied 49th place.","Rory McIlroy missed four-foot put .

I had 40 yards and hit a little pitch, it checked up and it ran right up in the middle, so that was nice.

"By . Ben Nagle for MailOnline . Louis van Gaal's old coach Barry Hughes has claimed that the current Manchester United boss would have been better suited to a teaching role than one in the cut-throat world of football management. Welshman Hughes, who coached van Gaal at Sparta Rotterdam in the early 1980s, has admitted his surprise at seeing the Dutchman rise up the managerial ladder. 'Louis wasn't one I had marked down for a career in management... not for a minute. 'I always thought he would go back to teaching. I never believed he would stay in the game. I didn't look at him and think, ""he's got something special, he could be a decent manager,""' Hughes told The Sunday People. Youthful: A younger-looking Louis van Gaal during his coaching days in Holland . Learning the ropes: van Gaal (right) with Spitz Kohn (left) during Lisbon v Ajax in September, 1988 . Despite Hughes' initial doubt at van Gaal's managerial capabilities, the former Netherlands coach has been in coaching for 28 years, the last 23 of which he has held a top European position. Upon leaving Sparta Rotterdam in 1986, the club at which he played for the majority of his career, van Gaal had a short playing spell at AZ Alkmaar, before becoming assistant manager. He then joined Ajax in the same role, before becoming the club's manager in 1991. From there, the Dutchman has managed his country in two separate spells, been in charge of Barcelona twice, Bayern Munich once, and now holds the top role at Manchester United. Before and after: van Gaal has come a long way since his playing days, pictured (left) in 1985 . Hughes though, maintains that it came out of the blue, and that he had never spoken to van Gaal about the possibility of coaching, despite working with him in the lead-up to the birth of his management career. 'When I managed him, I never had a discussion with him about coaching. He didn't come in and ask me about anything. Dick Advocaat...would ask questions as to why we did certain sessions - but never Louis.' Hughes, the former Welsh international footballer who made a name for himself after discovering Ruud Gullit as a 15-year-old at Haarlem, began coaching in the Netherlands in 1966, and crossed paths with van Gaal in 1978 when he joined Sparta Rotterdam. At the time, van Gaal was playing football semi-professionally, while juggling a side job as a PE teacher. Little did either of them know that 36 years later, he would be in charge at Old Trafford.

"By . Matt Barlow for MailOnline . England would be facing Switzerland later in their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign if manager Roy Hodgson had been able to pick and choose the Three Lions' fixtures. Wayne Rooney and Co take on Vladimir Petkovic's side in Basle on Monday as they begin their bid to reach the European Championships in France. But Hodgson admits that he would've rather faced Switzerland at a later date as he continues to rebuild after a disastrous World Cup in Brazil. Tough test: England boss Roy Hodgson (right) admits he would have rather faced Switzerland at a later date . Settling in: Hodgson wishes he had more time to integrate youngsters like Raheem Sterling (right) Preparation: The Three Lions begin their Euro 2016 qualifying campaign against Switzerland on Monday . Asked about England's youthful squad in his pre-match press conference, Hodgson said: 'In an ideal world we would've played Switzerland - our major rival for the No 1 spot in the group - after we had a bit more time forming this group of players into the team we want. 'You don't get that benefit. It will be a big test for them.' Hodgson has no new injuries to worry about after the withdrawal of Daniel Sturridge with a thigh problem and the former West Brom boss insists he is content with his attacking options. 'The fact we're pleased with our options is shown by the fact we've not taken anyone in to replace Daniel Sturridge,' he said. 'We're devastated for him because he was so anxious to play in the game and had to limp out of the training session.' Dangerous: Hodgson believes Xherdan Shaqiri (right) and Co are the biggest threat to England in Group E . Ruled out: Daniel Sturridge has been forced to return to Liverpool after picking up a thigh problem in training . Sturridge's injury means that Wayne Rooney is almost certain to start as a central striker, although Hodgson was giving nothing away a little over 24 hours before the Three Lions take to the pitch at St Jakob Park. He said: 'Wayne Rooney has played many positions for England already, certainly he has for me. He's played out on the left, centre forward and behind the centre forward. I'm not really going to tell you where he will play but he can play in a lot of positions.' England struggled to a 1-0 win in a friendly with Norway at Wembley earlier this week and Hodgson admits that the result of Monday's game is the most important thing, even if he is hoping for an impressive performance to accompany three points. Asked what would be a good result against Petkovic's side, the 67-year-old said: 'It depends what happens in the game. If you're losing near the end and get an equaliser you come away feeling good. It's foolish to say the only good result is this or that. I want to see theee how the players perform. Honest: Hodgson admits that he'd accept a bad performance and three points against Switzerland . Having a go: Rickie Lambert shoots at goal during in England training at St George's Park on Friday . 'I want the result. I'll play badly and win given the choice. But we have to lift our heads a little bit. How we play is vitally important. 'We've got reasons to be cheerful if you're able to put behind you that fact that the World Cup was a major disappointment. 'See the talent of the players and their desire to step forward and do well, then add up to 10 players not here and we're looking at a fairly large group who, if they continue as they started, bodes well for two years' time when they will have played a lot more games.' Petkovic took charge of the Swiss national side following the departure of Ottmar Hitzfeld after the World Cup but Hodgson is confident that he is well prepared for Monday's game, even if the former Lazio boss may be a little bit of an unknown quantity. 'We do know the players and they'll form the backbone of Petkovic's team,' he said. 'It's not a new England team per se but there's a lot of players that Petkovic and the Swiss people won't have seen too much of.'

Great news for Sydney's fashionistas - H&M has announced  they have found the perfect Sydney location for their second store in Australia, which is set to open mid-2015. The Swedish retail-clothing company exists in 53 countries across the world, and in April this year opened its Australian flagship store in Melbourne, which recorded one of H&M's most successful opening days for a new store,  Sydney Morning Herald reported in April.

Australian supermodel, Miranda Kerr launch H&M's 2014 spring collection . 'We deliver the latest fashion but from what I understand the Australian market has been receiving trends one season too late. It has to change; as retailers we have to do better. Especially in a city such as Sydney, which has world-class restaurants, yet the shopping is not up to the same standard,' H&M manager for Australian Hans Andersson recently told Sydney Morning Herald. Sydney's H&M boutique will offer their full collection which includes homewares, sportswear, an accessory range and all clothing  for women, men and children. The western suburbs of Sydney is also set to welcome H&M's much anticipated collaborative collection with American fashion-designer Alexander Wang, to North Ryde's AMP Macquarie Centre on October 16. 'We will have Alexander Wang in Macquarie and Melbourne, so both stores will have them in store in November, which is something that we don't normally do in suburban stores,' Mr Andersson said. The H&M store in Melbourne's historic GPO building apparently saw more than 1.7 million people in less than 20 weeks, and now sees customers  queuing outside the store made for 1200-persons. Mr Andersson said Sydney is now the teams focus, which will be drawing on LA marketing and stock due to warmer weather and influence of water. But Sydney shoppers are not the only ones that should be excited, with rumours revealing H&M's thoughts to collaborate with a local Australian designer, who is yet to be established, before Sydney's launch.

However, the court is still considering whether to . formally approve Tiede's release from prison on bond this past May. Release: Bernie Tiede walks into a court before a hearing granting his release at the Panola County court house in Carthage, Texas . Tiede was given a life . sentence in 1999 for shooting 81-year-old Nugent four times before . hiding her body in her freezer in the East Texas town of Carthage. Interest in the case surged after the 2011 release of the movie 'Bernie,' in which Jack Black portrays Tiede as a quirky mortician's . assistant beloved by the town. Nugent is depicted by Shirley MacLaine as . a grumpy, unpopular cheapskate. The family said that they are also keen to push back . against the movie's portrayal of her as a curmudgeon. Nugent's distraught relatives said that they only found out about Tiede's release from reporters and they're now fighting to have their protests heard inside a courtroom.

Doppelgangers: Bernie Tiede (left) is the inspiration for Jack Black's (right) character in the movie Bernie . 'My grandmother was a real person,' her granddaughter, Shanna Nugent, said Friday in an interview. 'She can't tell you what happened and she can't defend herself, and the reason she can't is Bernie Tiede killed her. He stole her money and he killed her.' A judge in May ruled Tiede had been sentenced too harshly because jurors did not know he had felt abused by Nugent and that he had been sexually abused as a child. But while Judge Diane DeVasto let Tiede go free on bond, the Court of Criminal Appeals must decide whether to formally accept the sentence reduction. Nugent family members did not find out about that hearing until after it was finished, Shanna Nugent said. They are now trying to persuade the appeals court to return Tiede to prison, sending a brief to the court in June that argued Tiede should have revealed the abuse when he was convicted and that it could not be considered new evidence now.

Art imitating life: Linklater attended Tiede's . murder trial and co-wrote the screenplay for his 2011 dark comedy Bernie . starring Jack Black with a Texas reporter . But Tiede's attorneys responded with an Aug. 12 letter arguing that Nugent's family needed to wait to make arguments until after sentencing was settled. 'This case needs to be decided objectively, using legal precedents and the record, without the outside influence of emotionally based public opinion,' the letter said. Panola County District Attorney Danny Buck Davidson, who prosecuted Tiede but now supports his release, and Austin attorney Jodi Cole, one of Tiede's lawyers, did not return phone messages Friday. Nugent's family responded with an Aug. 21 letter arguing that the victim's family deserved to be heard, especially since Davidson now agreed with Tiede's attorneys. Nugent family attorney Chad Baruch said he expected the appeals court to decide on Tiede's sentence without saying first whether it would consider the Nugents' arguments. The court could take months to make a final decision. 'We would like to be heard,' Shanna Nugent said Friday. 'There's no one else to present the opposite side.'

'I hope he goes for it because it will be the making of him. I have told him that. It was the first conversation I had with him. I told him ""Mario, it’s there for you"".

"Ronny Deila is in the mood for a Celtic Park party — after challenging his players to prove they belong in the Champions League. Celtic stand just one strong performance away from reaching the group stages of Europe’s elite club competition, as they take a 1-1 away draw into the return leg of Tuesday's play-off with NK Maribor. Delia knows the reprieve Celtic were handed after being trounced by Legia Warsaw in the previous qualifying round, with Scotland’s champions awarded a 3-0 home win after the Poles fielded an ineligible player as a late substitute, has caused some to question whether they deserve this crack at the big time. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Leigh Griffiths leads back-heel keepy ups in Celtic training . Away to go: Callum McGregor celebrates Celtic's crucial away goal in Slovenia giving them a good chance . But he insists that seeing off their Slovenian opponents will silence all doubters – and send him into a festive season frenzy before August is out. ‘It is Christmas Day and Happy New Year at the same time, if we can do it,’ said Deila. ‘It would be fantastic, it’s my dream to do it, to coach a team in the biggest tournament in football, at the highest level. I get goose bumps when I think of it, it’s fantastic. I’m really looking forward to it. ‘Of course it is the most important night of this season. The biggest. I can’t wait. ‘It’s been a long 10 weeks of hard work, ups and downs. Now we’re here at the final moment, the moment of decision. We have to go out and attack the game. ‘If we go through, we will have shown we belong in the Champions League – because we’ve been good enough to qualify. That is the main thing. ‘I’ll say it again, Legia Warsaw were a better team than us. But things happened and now we have an opportunity in the play-off. Maribor is there and, if we beat them, we have shown we can be in the Champions League. If we don’t beat them then we say: “Okay, we’re not good enough.” Final task: A win against Maribor on Tuesday night at Celtic Park would seal Champions League qualification . ‘That’s where we are now. But let’s give everything and see where it takes us. We can look on this night and see where we are. ‘If we can qualify it wouldn’t mean any less to us because of what happened with Legia Warsaw. As I have said before, it was out of our hands. We got another opportunity to prove we are good enough.’ Deila insisted that pending deals to bring in Wakaso Mubarak and – most probably – Stefan Scepovic were not dependent on securing a spot in the world’s most lucrative club competition. ‘Transfers happen step by step,’ he said. ‘I am comfortable with what I have going into this game. I look at the players and the atmosphere with the group is good. They are the ones who have to do it and I really believe in them.’ Handed a second chance: The substitute appearance of Bartosz Beresynski (right) kept Celitc alive . That said, progression tonight may hold the key to whether Celtic can retain Virgil van Dijk. Sevilla are back in the hunt for the Dutch centre-half after having agreed a deal to sell central defender Federico Fazio to Spurs for around £8million. Their first-choice replacement is Juventus and Italy stopper Angelo Ogbonna but negotiations on a fee have stalled as the Italian champions want in excess of £13m. With the transfer window closing on Monday, they have had to look closely at alternatives and sources in Spain have placed van Dijk high up on the list. Much, of course, could depend on the outcome of tonight’s match. Should Celtic not make it past the Slovenian champions, there will be a temptation to cash in on van Dijk, a player they value at more than £6m. While Celtic continue to work at bringing players in, striker Amido Balde was last night the subject of a loan offer from former club Vitoria Guimares – clearing more space in the squad for a new front man.

Newcastle United fans also held a banner saying 'Pardew is a muppet' during the 4-0 defeat at St Mary's . Speaking on Sky Sports News having refused to attend his press conference, Pardew said: '‘The early goals put us on the back foot. We made individual mistakes that we couldn’t absorb. We have to take that as a team. ‘We had a great chance at 2-0 and half a chance after that. We have played OK at the start of the season and really got caught out today. ‘We didn’t have long to prepare after the internationals but there’s no excuse really. The players tried everything at 2-0. We just caught at the start.' Pardew's men have yet to win a match this season and have slipped to the bottom of the Premier League table on goal difference having conceded seven goals in their last two matches.

It’s not easy to digest but it isn’t easy for the players who have to play in these circumstances. ‘We have to be strong and tough it out. We have to put ourselves on the line and be brave.

"By . Jason Mellor . Alan Pardew has questioned Hatem Ben Arfa’s ‘love and passion’ for Newcastle after insisting he hasn’t taken a risk in showing the Frenchman the door. Under-fire Pardew conceded his decision to loan the fans’ favourite to Premier League rivals Hull City is unpopular after fans set up a website calling for his head. But he has asked supporters to look at the bigger picture, and is happy to take flak for making difficult choices he is adamant are for the club’s long-term benefit. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Newcastle boss Pardew praises unstoppable Ben Arfa (ARCHIVE) Hatem Ben Arfa's departure has upset many Newcastle fans but Alan Pardew insists it was the right decision . French midfielder Ben Arfa joined Hull City on loan during transfer deadline day after falling out with Pardew . ‘It would have been an easy decision to keep him,’ Pardew said. ‘But you have to make tough decisions and I made the decision because I think the players we have here have a love and a passion for the club, the shirt and for the fans. ‘Is it a risk to let Hatem Ben Arfa go? Not in my opinion.’ Pardew brushed off the sackpardew.com website and a recent online poll where 85 per cent of fans called for his near four-year tenure to be brought to an end after a winless start to the season. The Newcastle manager is under pressure from fans after allowing the talented Ben Arfa to leave . ‘I respond to pressure like I always do,’ he said. ‘Everybody in the Premier League has it coming, but for me it’s come a little bit quicker than I expected and I have to deal with that.’ Cheick Tiote will not be available to start against Southampton this weekend after playing twice for the Ivory Coast despite an agreement from their FA to rest him. Jack Colback is back in training after overcoming the calf problem that saw him pull out of the England squad, but Rolando Aarons faces a month on the sidelines with hamstring trouble.

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . Celtic have issued a firm denial on behalf of winger Aleksandar Tonev after the Bulgarian was accused of racially abusing Aberdeen defender Shay Logan during his debut for the Scottish champions. The 24-year-old international is facing a Scottish FA probe after being reported by the Dons for an alleged incident during Saturday's 2-1 Premiership win for Ronny Deila's side at Parkhead. The pair were direct opponents for much of the match and Englishman Logan is understood to have told referee Bobby Madden that Tonev said to him: 'Get your hands off me, you black c***.' Shay Logan has accused Aleksandar Tonev of racial abuse during Celtic's 2-1 win over Aberdeen . The SFA are likely to investigate the incident once they receive a report from the referee on Monday . But Tonev vehemently denied the claims when quizzed by manager Ronny Deila and assistant John Collins. And on Sunday night a Celtic spokesman told Sportsmail: 'We have spoken to the player and he has stated that the accusation made is not true.' Logan, 26, was left so incensed by the alleged confrontation with Tonev that after alerting Madden he also directed Dons skipper Mark Reynolds to take up the matter formally with the match official. He then informed his manager Derek McInnes, with the Aberdeen management team alerting fourth official Crawford Allan as well as Celtic to the allegation. The alleged incident will be mentioned in Madden's report which is due to arrive on the desk of new SFA Compliance Officer Tony McGlennan at Hampden on Monday. It is also expected to feature prominently in the report by SPFL delegate John Connelly. It is alleged that Tonev called the Aberdeen defender a 'black c***' during the game at Celtic Park . Both Logan and Tonev, as well as opposing managers Deila and McInnes, are now likely to be contacted by the SFA's Disciplinary Department, as well as Madden. The SFA's Disciplinary Department would then investigate before deciding whether or not there were grounds to issue a Notice of Complaint against Tonev. They confirmed the disciplinary process would only begin when Madden's report is received. But with Tonev denying the claim, unless the alleged exchange was witnessed by another player or caught on camera it is likely to remain a case of one man's word against another. Aberdeen privately accept that they Aleksandar Tonev is unlikely to be found guilty without more evidence . Celtic said on Sunday night that Aleksandar Tonev 'has stated that the accusation made is not true' Aberdeen declined to comment ahead of a potential SFA investigation but Sportsmail understands they privately accept it may be hard to prove Logan's claim. A source close to the club on Sunday added that they felt obliged to take their player's word and report his complaint. Celtic signed Tonev on a one-year loan from Paul Lambert's Aston Villa last month and have an option to buy him permanently next summer. He is expected to be part of the squad who travel to Austria this week for Thursday's Europa League clash with Salzburg. Aleksandar Tonev is still expected to travel to Salzburg for Celtic's Europa League tie on Thursday . He had to wait until Saturday to make his debut after recovering from a groin injury and played for 70 minutes before being replaced by Nir Biton. Fraser Wishart, chief executive of PFA Scotland, said it would be 'inappropriate to comment at this time' because the incident could result in an investigation by the SFA. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Shay Logan alleges that Aleksandar Tonev called him a 'black c***'

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . Jason Denayer is not the type to speak in headlines. The young Belgian defender will never use three words when one will suffice. His voice is so quiet it stretches digital technology to its limits. And yet, sitting in Celtic’s main stand after Saturday’s 2-1 win over Aberdeen, the on-loan defender made a big, brash statement. Looking ahead to Thursday’s Europa League curtain raiser in Salzburg, the 20-year-old expressed the belief that Ronny Deila’s men could actually reach the final, an honour last achieved at Parkhead in 2003 by a team featuring Henrik Larsson, Chris Sutton et al. Jason Denayer claims that Celtic are good enough to reach the final of the Europa League this year . ‘Everyone is disappointed about not getting into the Champions League, because all the supporters and all of the players wanted to be there,’ said the 19-year-old currently on loan from Manchester City. ‘But we can’t focus on the past and say: “That’s bad.” We must concentrate on the Europa League and do all we can do in that competition. ‘If we play as we can, if we play to 100 per cent of our ability, we can go to the final. It’s about us. Celtic is a big club with high expectations and we will try to meet them.’ On the evidence of the season so far, even mentioning Celtic in the same sentence as a Europa League final in Warsaw is strong stuff. This is a team who have won five of their 11 competitive games so far. A team who are in transition. Deila’s side have had two cracks at the Champions League and blown them both; a fact that Aberdeen’s travelling support were quick to cast up on Saturday. One of those attempts, of course, was against Legia Warsaw and ended in a 6-1 defeat, before the most unexpected of UEFA reprieves arrived on a technicality amid much acrimony. Were Celtic to make it to the Polish capital, then, their green and white shirts would have to be insulated by flak jackets. Celtic beat Aberdeen 2-1 in Glasgow, goals from Jason Denayer and Kris Commons sealed it for the Bhoys . There were signs of improvement against Aberdeen, no question. Deila pronounced himself particularly delighted with the return to fitness of captain Scott Brown. New loan signing Stefan Scepovic was only denied a debut goal by an offside flag. And Aleksandar Tonev had some decent touches long before he was embroiled in disturbing accusations of racism towards Aberdeen full-back Shay Logan. But Denayer summed up Celtic’s performance perfectly when he said: ‘It’s good, it’s okay. ‘I think we are getting close to how the manager wants us to play. In the first half against Aberdeen, we did very well. The second half was more difficult. We need to train more now, we need time and we will be better.’ At 2-0 ahead after 46 minutes Celtic were coasting, Then, from nowhere, a football match broke out. By time up Aberdeen were nursing a sense of injustice and discontent at their failure to take a point at least. As in his home league debut against Dundee United, Denayer set the ball rolling early. A Kris Commons corner in the seventh minute was flicked by an Aberdeen head towards the back post where Efe Ambrose thrashed a volley off his defensive team-mate on the goal-line and into the net. Jason Denayer is on loan from Premier League champions Manchester City for the season . It was an odd affair, Denayer saying: ‘I remember a little bit about the goal. The ball came to Efe and he took a shot. The ball hit a defender, then hit me and went in the goal. I’m very happy to score two goals in two home games now and it gives me more confidence. I feel good now.’ In control of the game, Celtic made it 2-0 in the first minute of the second half, Callum McGregor’s cut back from the right side picking out Commons, the attacker’s left foot strike deflecting off a luckless Logan and past Jamie Langfield in goal for 2-0. At which point the game seemed safe. Commons, his future in doubt after his omission from the two European games with Maribor, had proven his value once more. With half an hour remaining, however, the game finally began to fulfil pre-match expectations. Aberdeen, the team rated most likely to challenge Celtic this season, began to play. Why it took them so long is the question. Peter Pawlett produced the first of a string of fine saves from Craig Gordon before David Goodwillie scored his first goal for the club, swooping to nod Andrew Considine’s back post knock down into the net from six yards out. Suddenly, Aberdeen were back in the game. Their belief was apparent. Derek McInnes would later describe the home team’s display in the final half hour as ‘vulnerable, agitated and nervy.’ He wasn’t wrong. As well as Jason Denayer, Celtic have also loaned Swedish striker John Guidetti from Manchester City . The game might easily have swung the way of an invigorated visiting side but for Gordon, fast becoming Celtic’s best piece of transfer business in quite some time. The Scotland keeper parried Niall McGinn’s thumping shot from 18 yards, then pushed away Willo Flood’s rising long range shot towards the top corner. Yet Aberdeen were irate when referee Bobby Madden failed to award a penalty when Commons raised his hands to block a McGinn free kick. McInnes argued the point with the referee on the long walk down the tunnel and did so again vocally in the post-match press conference. Later on, a Dons grievance against Tonev for altogether more serious reasons would make this a trying day for the official. Raised hands remain one of football’s great grey areas. An incessant bone of contention. Had they scored a penalty, McInnes believes his team would have won. As it transpired, their last chance to take at least a point passed in 81 minutes when substitute Adam Rooney knocked down a Goodwillie cross and McGinn blazed the ball over the bar. How Celtic’s shuddering, shaky last half hour display squares with Denayer’s belief that the team have it in them to reach the Europa League final is unclear. But the Parkhead side can certainly take confidence from the performance of Virgil van Dijk. The Dutch defender was unhappy with the reluctance of the champions to sell him in the final days of the transfer window, but turned in a solid, professional performance to allay concerns over his ongoing levels of commitment. ‘I feel very good playing alongside Virgil,’ said Denayer in admiration afterwards. ‘He speaks to me a lot. He is very calm. When he speaks, it is not aggressively. It is better to speak calmly, we understand each other better that way. ‘Virgil is a very good player and I think he can play at the highest level. I’m very happy he stayed at the club.’ In the final stages of this see-saw football match, they all were.","Celtic can reach Europa League final, says Jason Denayer .

"By . Stephen Mcgowan for the Daily Mail . A former teacher, Ronny Deila will have no need of a ghost writer to pen his memoirs. The Celtic chapters will make for essential reading. The Norwegian can already visualise how they will end; silver laden and filled with tales of triumph. The middle section will develop the plot. The introduction? Legia Warsaw, Inverness and Maribor will make that read like a crime noir novel. By his own admission, Deila has struggled to plough through the opening pages of life at Celtic. Yet the Norwegian subscribes to the view that for the new and unfamiliar to become normal, a man must be overwhelmed for a bit on the way. Ronny Deila has had a difficult start to life at Celtic, with the Hoops lagging in an alien 5th place . One of Deila's first signings was Manchester City's John Guidetti on a season-long loan deal . ‘I think now it is chapter two,’ said Deila ahead of today’s Premiership clash with Aberdeen at Celtic Park. ‘But I am very glad that I had chapter one here, because it can’t be more intense than those 10 weeks were, travelling all over Europe, a lot of new things. ‘Without those 10 weeks, I wouldn’t be here with the knowledge I have now. So that has been positive. It becomes my chapter now.’ Already there are Celtic supporters who find Deila’s team sheets unreadable and incomprehensible. The suspicion he doesn’t yet know his best team has been both difficult to shift and damaging. Yet he probably still doesn’t — and won’t for some weeks. Aleksander Tonev and Wakaso Mubarak have yet to play a first-team game while the inclusion of John Guidetti, Stefan Scepovic and Scott Brown offers no guarantees of immediate and sweeping improvement. Deila (right) was unveiled as Celtic manager with Peter Lawwell (left) on June 6 . Norwegian Deila became Celtic manager after six years in charge of Strømsgodset . The problem for Deila is that he talks a good game even when his team can’t match his fine words. In the early weeks, the 38-year-old’s idealism about systems and philosophies obscured a basic truth; Celtic’s squad wasn’t good enough. A fact which compounded an already huge cultural shift for the new manager. ‘It’s a situation that I don’t think anybody can put themselves into,’ he said of managing Celtic. ‘To take a big team is one thing. I had never been to Scotland before – well, one time - but coming into a new culture and a new team and new experiences, and then you have also the Champions League coming very quickly. ‘And also the (transfer) window takes a lot of energy. So there were so many tasks and you have to know your staff, you have to put your ideas in — there’s an unbelievable lot to do.’ There have been times, bluntly, when people have wondered if the former coach of Stromsgodset might not be up to it. Celtic chief executive Peter Lawwell insisted he is — describing the situation Deila inherited, with Champions League qualifiers and a weaker squad, as a ‘s***storm’. ‘I can understand what Peter is saying,’ added the Norwegian. ‘But it has been fantastic, as well. ‘The opportunity is fantastic and I think there is so much potential here. When I look at the players, I see a lot of skills and a lot of opportunities.’ Deila admits his first three months in charge of the Scottish giants has bee hectic . Deila is a relatively inexperienced manager, and some Celtic fans have not taken to him . The international break offered the first real pause for reflection, an opportunity to return home, visit his daughters and think some clear thoughts. ‘There was a lot of reflection,’ he conceded. ‘When it’s games all the time, it’s very hard to see the whole picture, so to get home it was very good to just reflect on things and see where we are and what the next moves are. ‘I can see positive things happening and, of course, things that we need to do better. That is how the process is going on. I’m looking forward now to getting started.’ Deila maintains that the fitness and speed of movement has to improve and that it will. Tonev is not yet 100 per cent while Mubarak only returned from international duty last night, rendering both of the new signings frustratingly out of reach for now. But the Norwegian still claims he can see what he wants and how he wants to get there. Enacting change while getting results is a tricky business; a difficult balancing act. But he knows now what he is dealing with after a bewildering, overwhelming start to life at Celtic. Deila was unveiled during a photo call at Celtic Park on Friday June 6 . Celtic's ambitions of a third successive Champions League campaign ended on August 6 at Murrayfield . ‘Of course there has been a lot of pressure,’ Deila continued. ‘I think the pressure after results is different to what I’m used to. ‘But also we have much better players here. The Champions League is a very high level so the fitness we had, and the squad we had, was not good enough. We need new ideas. ‘I wanted to be in the Champions League, that’s for sure. The best thing is that the window is closed and I have finished with those questions. ‘We know what we have to work with and how we are going to develop the best possible team with the players we have. ‘You have to get results and also get your own style and develop things. You don’t want to do that too early because it can affect the immediate results. Now we know what kind of squad we have until Christmas and that is positive.’ Aberdeen will travel to Glasgow fancying their chances. A dismal run of 18 straight Parkhead defeats in the league stretches back to 2004, but fails to reflect a bold, gutsy, Scottish Cup win in Glasgow’s east end last season. Often more effective in attack away from home, Aberdeen will ask questions of Deila’s reshaped team. Few expect them to show much sign of fear and neither should they. ‘You would have to ask them that,’ added Deila. ‘But I know how good we are when we are playing well. We’ve had good spells in every match. Ronny Deila reacts during the third qualifying round of the UEFA Champions League in Warsaw, Poland . ‘We didn’t play well against Dundee but we had 70-per-cent possession and made 700 passes. We just have to create more. ‘It would be worse if we didn’t have the ball, so it’s about what we do with our attacking play. It’s also about our defending, especially in transition. ‘That’s what I love to do, to work with a team which has the ball a lot. I want us to look more like we did against Dundee United. We showed ourselves in a good way that day. ‘In time, we will hopefully see that every week.’ VIDEO: John Guidetti speaks about his loan move to Celtic .","Deila admits he has had a difficult start to life as Celtic manager .

"By . Mark Teece . The opening weekend of the NFL season concludes with a Monday Night Football double bill as the Detroit Lions entertain the New York Giants at Ford Field before the San Diego Chargers visit the Arizona Cardinals. New York Giants at Detroit Lions . The London-bound Lions will be hoping they can finally win the NFC North. Last season, Detroit were in pole position to clinch the division, only to lose their final four games and miss out. The addition of Golden Tate in free agency gives the Lions a legitimate target to go with of star wideout Calvin Johnson. Outside of Johnson, either a running back or tight end has posted the next highest total of receiving yards for the last four seasons (Joique Bell, 547 yards in 2013, Brandon Pettigrew 567 in yards 2012, 777 yards in 2011 and 722 yards in 2010). A potent passing game is complemented by the backfield duo of Reggie Bush and Joique Bell, who combined for 1656 rushing yards as well as 1053 receiving. Come in No 2: Golden Tate (left) will add a much-needed alternative to the majestic Calvin Johnson . Questions remain over the secondary, with the passing defence surrendering an average of 246 yards per game. Any short comings in the secondary could be masked by the guys on the line. Both Ndamukong Suh and Nick Fairley have the talent to dominate, but either are prone to imploding mentally. Second year defensive end Ziggy Ansah is one to watch throughout the season, as the Lions look to improve on their pass rush. The Giants bolstered their defense during the off-season with the addition of cornerbacks Dominique Rodgers-Cromartie and Walter Thurman, along with a fully fit Jason Pierre-Paul. Eli Manning will be looking to put behind him the struggles of last season, during which he threw a league leading 27 interceptions. Following the retirement of Kevin Gilbride, new offensive coordinator Ben McAdoo, will look to reinvigorate Manning. However Eli has struggled to grasp McAdoo's system after several poor performances during pre-season. Running back David Wilson was forced to retire during the off-season, and new addition Rashad Jennings is expected to carry the load, complemented by fourth round draft pick Andre Williams, who's caught the eye with some stout performances during pre-season. San Diego Chargers at Arizona Cardinals . On a career upsurge: Philip Rivers . Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers enjoyed a career season last year in regards to his completion percentage. His 69.5% completion rate, tops his prior career best of 66% which came back in 2010. Add to that the 32 touchdown passes thrown, which was Rivers' highest total since the 2008 season (34) and for those keeping track his interception total also fell, down by four to 11 (lowest total since 2009). Keenan Allen was sensational last season, posting 1046 yards and eight touchdowns. Hype seems to building around young tight end Ladarius Green. Combine all that with the splash play ability of Malcom Floyd, the evergreen Antonio Gates along with the backfield of Ryan Mathews, Danny Woodhead and Donald Brown and the Chargers possess a deceptively explosive offense. Defensive improvements have been made via the draft, with the addition of first round pick cornerback Jason Verrett, as the Chargers look to bolster a passing defense that short changed star safety Eric Weddle, giving up an average of 257.8 yards per game. The return of linebacker Melvin Ingram following a torn ACL is another huge boost for the defensive unit. The Cardinals have been hit by a mixture of injury and free agency losses within this talented defense, resulting in many people believing that the team is set to decline in 2014, that would be foolish in my eyes, as the Cardinals made a couple of stout moves by acquiring both corner back Antonio Cromartie and left tackle Jared Veldeer via free agency. With one of the games premier shutdown corners Patrick Peterson and the return of Tryann Mathieu from an season ending injury the cards possess an excellent secondary. Offensively, Carson Palmer is a solid veteran who has the potential to take the team to the play-offs. Bold statement I know but consider the weapons at his disposal, Larry Fitzgerald has looked like Super Bowl XLIII Fitzgerald during the pre-season, fellow wideout Michael Floyd is set for a breakout season, Troy Niklas a second round pick in this year’s draft is an excellent blocker and could prove to a vital outlet for Palmer. Another rookie to watch this season is the third round pick John Brown out of Pittsburgh State, his blazing speed gives the team not only a legitimate deep threat but an excellent weapon in the return game.

"By . Peter Carline . Cordarrelle Patterson is generating a lot of attention, but you get the impression he doesn't mind a bit. Both Minnesota Vikings team-mate Greg Jennings and Sports Illustrated have talked up the second-year receiver ahead of the new NFL season. And with new offensive co-ordinator Norv Turner designing the playbook, Patterson sounds pretty excited. 'Ah man! His offensive mind! He knows everything perfect, man. And that’s what you need to have - an offensive brain like him. The things he did last year! To have him here is just a blessing for me and my team mates. We feel like he's coming in and we can do great things for him.' Purple reign: Cordarrelle Patterson had no qualms in taking the No 84 jersey, made famous by Randy Moss . Turner trademarks include a strong running game, a vertical, deep ball threat and a tight end-friendly offense. With Adrian Peterson, Patterson, Jennings and Kyle Rudolph on board, the Vikings could be set for an exciting season. 'Everybody’s going to touch the ball, not just one person be the star. Everybody’s going to have their time to shine,' Patterson purrs. And Rudolph, who recently signed a five-year contract extension worth $36.5million, is all set to play his part after an injury-hit 2013 season. 'That’s my guy, man! Last year in my rookie year I was always training with him,' Patterson says. 'So I’ve seen the things he can do on the field. He’s the best tight end I’ve been around, so when he got that new deal I expect great things out of him.' Safe hands: Patterson caught three passes for 38 yards in the 10-6 pre-season win over the Oakland Raiders . Patterson is an infectious character with a zest for life. Nicknamed Flash, the 2013 first-round pick initially struggled with route running and timing, but shone as a return specialist, reaching the Pro Bowl. The electrifying 22-year-old returned 43 kickoffs for 1,393 yards and two touchdowns of 109 and 105 yards, with an NFL-leading 32.4-yard average. And in the final six games of the season, he showed much of his explosive potential as a receiver. Asked if he has any expectations, he laughed: 'I really don’t know, man… I hope I have a great year. I hope I can continue the year from last year, the last six games I had.' While Turner will be vital to his development, the impact of Mike Zimmer will also be key. 'He’s a great guy. He’s a hard man,' says Patterson of the notorious disciplinarian, who was handed his first role as head coach in January. Tough taskmaster: Mike Zimmer will attempt to revamp a defense which conceded an average of over 30 points a game . 'He’s going to let you have it, but at the end of the day he’s a mind. A great defensive mind. And a great coach. Day in day out. 'I like to write stuff down in my notebook in my iPad. Just take notes. You just try to learn from that and be good. Not to just be good, but I want to be great on the field.' While veteran quarterback Matt Cassel is expected to start for the season-opener in St Louis, 23-year-old Patterson had his own way of welcoming Teddy Bridgewater, the 32nd draft pick and future face of the franchise. Following his arrival in the Twin Cities in May, Patterson thought it prudent to welcome him to the Midwest by taking him to an NHL playoff game between the Minnesota Wild and the Chicago Blackhawks. 'You’ve got to get that vibe with your quarterback!', he says. 'Teddy’s just like me, coming in as a rookie.  Coming in the first round, people expect a lot of things out of you. He’s been great. Learning how to be a quarterback. I see a bright future ahead of Teddy.' Is Teddy ready? Bridgewater made his eagerly-awaited debut against the Raiders, but will he start in St Louis?","Patterson is predicted to be a top-five playmaker in the 2014 season .

"By . Pa Reporter . Keegan Bradley withdrew from the BMW Championship before starting his third round on Saturday due to a possible rules violation on the opening day. Bradley's third shot to the 18th hole in Thursday's first round came up short of the green, embedding in the steep grass face just above a bunker. The former US PGA champion took relief (under Rule 25-2) for a ball embedded in its own pitch mark, chipped onto the green and two-putted for a double-bogey six. Withdrawal: Keegan Bradley pulled out of the BMW Championship after a possible rules violation . However, after the round a spectator told Bradley he had seen the ball bounce before coming to rest, leaving the Ryder Cup wild card uncertain that he had handled the situation correctly. Bradley consulted PGA Tour rules official Slugger White on Friday and was cleared of any potential violation after the two discussed the situation and examined the pitch mark, but Bradley remained unsure that he had dropped the ball in the right place. In a statement from his management company, Bradley said: 'I just feel withdrawing is the right thing to do to protect the field in the BMW Championship and the Tour Championship next week. 'It's eating me alive. I didn't call my fellow competitors for help in the first place and that bothers me. I know the official approved the drop but I just can't be absolutely sure it was the right spot.'

"By . Jason Groves . and Sean Poulter for the Daily Mail . The big banks sent hundreds of thousands of letters from fake debt collection firms to ‘intimidate’ customers. HSBC, Barclays, Santander and RBS/Natwest admit using the trick on families deep in the red. The letters misleadingly suggest that law firms and outside debt collectors are being called in. The admissions, which follow a campaign by the Daily Mail to highlight the scandal, came in a series of letters released last night by MPs. In one of them, the chief executive of Barclays confessed the bank had used a number of ‘debt collection brands’. Scroll down for video . Shameful: Andrew Tyrie, chairman of the Treasury committee which published the letters, said: 'Many customers will have been understandably misled. It seems that this practice was widespread' Appearing to acknowledge intimidation, Antony Jenkins said the letters were meant to indicate to customers ‘an escalation in the seriousness of the situation’. RBS chief Ross McEwan said the bogus letters ‘reflected what had become a common industry practice in a sector that had come to put its own interests above those of its customers’. Andrew Tyrie, Tory chairman of the Treasury committee, which published the letters, said: ‘These letters seem to have been designed to pull the wool over consumers’ eyes. ‘Many customers will have been understandably misled. Intimidating: How the letters appear to customers . ‘What is more, from these responses it seems that this practice was widespread. Banks say that they have now stopped sending such correspondence but it should never have happened in the first place.’ The Mail revealed the extent of the problem in July, which prompted condemnation from Citizens Advice as well as investigations by MPs and the Solicitors Regulatory Authority. The Treasury Committee asked the banks to provide samples of the letters they sent out to customers and questioned them as to how long they had been using these debt collection methods. Yesterday, the committee published an exchange of letters with RBS/NatWest, HSBC, Barclays and Santander, which make clear they have all been guilty of long-running subterfuge. John Mann, a Labour member of the Treasury committee, said an ‘urgent inquiry’ was now needed into a practice he said was ‘obviously designed to intimidate people’. Barclays, HSBC, RBS and Santander all admitted using the practice for many years, but said they had now stopped following a public outcry. Student Loans Company boss Christian Brodie apologised and offered to resign in July this year after similar practices were uncovered at the organisation, which handles tens of billions of pounds in student loans. But none of the banks apologised in their letters to MPs. Mr McEwan came closest, saying: ‘I totally accept that we must always make it clear to our customers who they are communicating with. ‘I will not defend the continuation of a practice that does not meet the standards (I set for the business). The customer interest test should be applied to every single thing we do as a business. This activity failed that test.’ Overwhelmed: The letters will likely have been sent to some of the banks' worst-off customers in heavy debt . Mr McEwan said RBS had established an in-house solicitor, Green & Co, to help it collect debts. It also used the brands Triton Credit Services, Unidebt and Tamarisk Debt Management to fool customers into thinking they were dealing with outside agencies. Last year alone, Triton issued 423,000 letters to 119,000 customers, while Green & Co sent out a further 29,000 letters. Mr Jenkins claimed the use of other brands helped alert customers who had stopped opening letters from the bank that they were in trouble. He said text messages were now used. Campaign: A Daily Mail headline on July 4 this year . HSBC chief executive Alan Keir said it had used four separate in-house brands to suggest it had called in outside help in collecting debts. Mr Keir said the practice dated back to 1985 and stopped in July this year – after it was exposed by the Press. Thousands of HSBC customers struggling with their debts received letters from DG Solicitors, Metropolitan Collection Services, Central Debt Recovery Unit and Payment Services Bureau. In each case, the letter was actually from a part of HSBC, although this was made clear only in the small print. Santander also admitted using a ‘separately branded identity’ when collecting debts, but insisted this had never involved posing as a legal firm. The banks insisted the true ownership of the fake debt collection and legal agencies was made clear in the small print. Last month the payday loan firm Wonga was ordered to pay £2.6million in compensation to 45,000 customers over the practice.","HSBC, Barclays, Santander and RBS/Natwest all admit using the trick .

"By . Amy Ziniak for Daily Mail Australia . A mother seeking clearance to work with children and young people has been caught lying about her daughter having cancer for a number of years. The cruel hoax was exposed by the Queensland's Civil and Administrative Tribunal after the Gold Coast mother, who cannot be identified for legal reasons, applied to the state government for a blue card to work as a child protection officer. In a recent decision the tribunal denied the mothers request, citing a number concerns including a violent history between her ex-partner, an assault on her mother in law and reports her children and step children had suffered injuries under her care. A cruel hoax by a Gold Coast mother has been exposed by the Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT). The woman, who applied to the state government for a blue card to work with children and young people was caught out, lying about her daughter having cancer for several years when she didn't and access Camp Quality services . Also cause for concern was the mother's decision to tell one of her daughters that she had cancer in 1998 following laser surgery to her foot. The tribunal reported she received the results of her daughter’s biopsy that confirmed she did not have cancer but she did not inform her daughter and other family members. The tribunal also learned she accessed camp quality services for her daughter and three of her children. QCAT member Joanne Browne found matters of concern had been raised by an interstate child protection authority relating to the woman's past. 'The material received from Child Protection ACT disclosed information relating to the mothers six children who were subject to a child protection order in late 2005,' found Ms Brown. In a recent decision the QCAT tribunal denied the a Gold Coast mother a request for a blue card, citing a number concerns including a violent history between her ex-partner, an assault on her mother in law and reports her children and step children had suffered injuries under her care. Also that she had lied about her daughter having cancer for several years . It was also reported that her children were exposed to acts of physical and verbal aggression in the home, including allegations of harm towards her step children. The tribunal learned the woman's violent history included assaulting her mother in law, which she punched to the face causing her to be taken to hospital, of which she pleaded guilty. There was also evidence before the Tribunal that the mother received treatment for her depression and that she has completed some parenting courses and counselling since her separation from her former partner. Ms Browne said the decision to deny the woman a blue card related to her criminal history and her inconsistencies in giving evidence. 'The Tribunal is satisfied having considered all of the evidence that this is an exceptional case in which it would not be in the best interests of children for the Tribunal on review to issue a positive notice.' 'The Tribunal must hold the interests of children as its paramount.'
