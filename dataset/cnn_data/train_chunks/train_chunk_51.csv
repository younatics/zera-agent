"Below is an essay written by Steven Stanton's son Travis after he learned that his father was going to become a woman. The story of his father's transformation can be seen on ""Her Name Was Steven"" at 8 and 11 p.m. ET Saturday on CNN. Throughout my whole life, I thought my dad was a really tough guy. He went out with the cops and busted bad guys. He shot guns, fought fires, he was an aggressive driver, and he liked football and lots of sports. Then, one day my thoughts changed about him when we had a family meeting and he told me how he felt about himself. He said he felt like a woman on the inside and was going to change into one. He said he tried his best to be a manly guy, but he couldn't stop his feelings to become a girl. I was very surprised to hear this. At first, I thought I was in a dream. It was very hard to believe such a thing. I thought he was a 100% manly man, like more manly than most guys. After a few days, I thought about it. I knew he was making the right choice to become a girl. Although I can't relate to his feelings, it must be really hard to hide something like that. It would be like having one million dollars and not being able to spend it. After just so long, your feelings would take over and spend it. Now, though, I am very proud of my dad.  Read Travis' response to some viewer questions about his father . After I saw him, and saw that inside he was the same dad as he always was: he still likes football, he still likes to be an aggressive driver. He is still the same person, but just different on the outside. I am very happy for him now that he is who he wants to be. I think that everyone should be who they are and not try to be the same as other people. If you ask me, this has got to be the manliest thing he has done in his whole life. It takes a real man to come out of your shell and say, ""hey, I am who I am"" and take the responsibility of doing that. In conclusion, I thought my dad was a man, like, gender wise, but now he is who he is meant to be. He is himself.","Travis Stanton is son of Susan Stanton, who underwent sex-change operation .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- Investigators searching for the suspected killer of four Seattle-area police officers have rounded up several of his relatives and friends to keep them from helping him escape, a sheriff's spokesman said Monday. Police have brought in five or six relatives and other acquaintances of Maurice Clemmons, ""and we expect that number to grow,"" Pierce County Sheriff's Department spokesman Ed Troyer said. Some of Clemmons' family and friends have been trying to help him elude police and seek treatment for a gunshot wound, and they have tried to divert investigators by calling in false leads, he said. ""What we're going to do is eliminate those people, so he'll have no place to go,"" Troyer told CNN. A raid in the southern Seattle suburb of Renton late Monday was aimed at cutting off Clemmons from that support network, he said. Clemmons, 37, is an ex-convict with a long rap sheet in Washington and Arkansas, according to authorities and documents. He is wanted in what police called the ambush-style killing of four police officers from Lakewood, near Tacoma, about 40 miles south of Seattle. Witnesses say Clemmons was shot in the torso during the Sunday morning attack, and blood and gauze bandages were found in a truck linked to Clemmons, Troyer said. The sheriff's department said associates who refuse to cooperate with the investigation could face criminal charges. Clemmons is thought to have slipped away from a home in Seattle's Leschi neighborhood Sunday night, before police surrounded the residence for about 12 hours. He was not found in the home when the investigators moved in Monday morning, Seattle police spokesman Jeff Kappel told reporters. His escape was ""an unlucky thing for us, and a lucky thing for him,"" Troyer said Monday night. ""But his luck's going to run out, because he doesn't have people to help him do that any more."" The slain officers, three men and a woman, were killed at a coffee shop in Parkland, a suburb of Tacoma. Early Monday, authorities started identifying Clemmons as a suspect, rather than as someone wanted for questioning. The night before the shootings, Clemmons had threatened to kill police officers, but witnesses did not report those threats until after the slayings, Troyer said on ABC's ""Good Morning America."" Clemmons was accused of child rape and assaulting a police officer in May. He had been released on $150,000 bond five days before the shootings, according to court records. After his arrest, Clemmons' sister told police that he ""had not been himself lately"" and that his behavior was ""unpredictable and erratic."" ""He had said that the Secret Service was coming to get him because he had written a letter to the president,"" an affidavit quoted her as telling investigators. In addition, neighbors had complained that he had been throwing rocks through their windows. Clemmons' wife told deputies that she and her husband had argued over a ""newly discovered child,"" and she suggested that was why he went on his rock-throwing spree, according to an arrest affidavit. In 2000, then-Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee commuted a 95-year prison sentence for Clemmons, according to documents from the Arkansas Department of Community Correction. He returned to prison in 2001 but was paroled in 2004. ""Should he be found responsible for this horrible tragedy, it will be the result of a series of failures in the criminal justice system in both Arkansas and Washington state,"" Huckabee's office said in a statement Sunday night. During his 2008 presidential bid, Huckabee was criticized for granting clemency to another inmate, convicted rapist Wayne DuMond, who was later convicted of raping and murdering a woman in Missouri. Huckabee's statement brought a sharp response from Troyer on Monday. ""We're disappointed that Gov. Huckabee came out in the middle of the night without calling anybody here and blamed this on the criminal justice system in the state of Washington,"" Troyer said. ""We're guessing that's probably a spin doctor, not him."" Sunday's shooting was the first for the Lakewood police department, which was created five years ago for the town of nearly 60,000. Until then, the Pierce County Sheriff's Department provided law-enforcement services there. The slain officers were identified as Sgt. Mark Renninger, 39; Officer Ronald Owens, 37; Officer Tina Griswold, 40; and Officer Greg Richards, 42. All of them were parents and had been with the department since its inception. ""My worst nightmare has come true,"" Tiffany Ryan, Griswold's sister, told reporters. ""I can't tell you how painful it is to lose my sister."" Police Chief Bret Farrar told reporters Monday that he has repeatedly been asked how the city's officers are doing. ""This is how everybody's doing,"" Farrar said, gesturing to the police force standing behind him. ""They're here. They're doing their jobs. They're working hard. They're dealing with their loss. ... We're here to carry on. This is what we do."" The four officers ""were good people,"" Farrar said, fighting to maintain his composure. ""They were great officers, and we will all miss them very much."" The Lakewood Independent Police Guild is accepting donations for the officers' families, said guild president and Lakewood police officer Brian Wurts. Contributions have poured in from as far away as Switzerland, he said. ""I can't believe he was out on the street,"" Wurts said of the suspect. ""If they want to rehabilitate them, you can rehabilitate them -- but you rehabilitate them in prison, where they're supposed to be,"" he added. ""This guy should have never been on the street."" The coffee shop on Steele Street is a popular hangout for law enforcement officers and is one of 22 Forza Coffee Company locations in Washington. The company's CEO, Brad Carpenter, is a retired police officer. In a statement on the company Web site, he said the shooting ""hits extremely close to home to me."" Police said the gunman walked past the officers to the counter as if to order, then pulled a gun out of his coat and began shooting at 8:15 a.m. Sunday. Two of the officers were ""executed"" as they sat at a table, Troyer said. Another was shot when he stood up, and the fourth was shot after struggling with the gunman all the way out the door, Troyer said. All were in uniform, with their marked patrol cars parked outside. Two baristas and other customers inside the shop were unharmed. ""Just the law enforcement officers were targeted,"" Troyer said. CNN's Patrick Oppmann, Dan Simon, Dave Alsup, Dina Majoli and Matt Smith contributed to this report.","Police round up relatives, friends of suspect to keep them from helping him escape .

"(Reader's Digest) -- What causes the greatest amount of ""green guilt"" across the globe? Not recycling enough was the number one response in 9 out of 15 countries surveyed, followed by wasting water. A new global ""Around the World"" poll, conducted by Reader's Digest and published in all of its 50 April editions worldwide, found that Brazil was the country where the largest number (42 percent) polled said they feel guilty about not recycling enough, followed by Malaysia and Russia (both 40 percent), China and the Netherlands (both 35 percent), and France (31 percent). The United States and the Philippines (both 30 percent) ranked below them. The most guilt in the survey was felt by the water-worried Spaniards. Cosme Ojeda, editor of Reader's Digest Spain, says, ""In our arid country, we are all aware of the lack of water every day."" India (39 percent) and Italy (30 percent) ranked behind them, but it was also their biggest concern.

The piano bar is dimly lit, so it's obviously got that going for it, and it also features delicious food and an intimate courtyard festooned by plants, a fountain, and fairy lights.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- At first glance of Friday's Los Angeles Times, you might think the Mad Hatter has taken over the newspaper. Johnny Depp's colorful character in Disney's new film ""Alice in Wonderland"" dominates a faked front page, which includes the paper's traditional flag and two stories that appeared in the paper last month. Los Angeles Times spokesman John Conroy said the ""cover-wrap"" was an ""unusual opportunity to stretch the usual boundaries and design an innovative ad designed to create buzz."" Roy Peter Clark, a senior journalism scholar at the Poynter Institute, said tough economic times and lower ads sales have forced newspapers to tear down the ethics wall that separated a paper's front page from advertisers. ""The wall became in recent years a fence, but the Los Angeles Times has created a swinging gate,"" Clark said. ""What offends my traditional sensibilities is the notion that you would be willing to deceive the reader into thinking that this was the actual front page,"" Clark said. Although Conroy said readers would not be confused by the fake front, several journalists in CNN's Los Angeles bureau did not immediately realize that the real front page was inside. A Times reader who works for a movie marketing company in Hollywood said he felt deceived by the ad. He asked not to be identified because his company, which was not involved in the Disney campaign, deals with the newspaper. ""We propose these kinds of ads all the time but have never gotten them approved,"" he said. ""I don't always agree with what we do."" He estimated that the ad would cost ""well over $100,000."" Conroy would not disclose the price, but he said, ""Our front page section is our most valued real estate. The ad was priced accordingly."" The use of real newspaper stories, published previously in the newspaper, to make the ad appear to be a real front page is another issue, Clark said. ""I'm particularly nervous about them running fake stories that are really real stories,"" he said. ""That seems like a misappropriation of the journalism in the newspaper."" An online search revealed that the article on the left column -- headlined ""To take reins on health proposal"" -- was a slightly altered version of a story written by Tribune Co. Washington reporter Noam Levey. It was published February 18. The second article, appearing on the right column of the Disney ad, was headlined ""Major Afghan Figure Caught."" The original story was published February 19, with the bylines of Times foreign correspondent Laura King and Moscow bureau chief Alex Rodriguez. ""If I had written one of those stories, I would be pissed,"" Clark said. CNN has received no response from e-mails and calls to the three journalists. Although they may not be pleased with their work being used in a movie ad -- without the byline -- they have jobs while many of their co-workers have been laid off. The Tribune Publishing Co., the paper's parent, has ordered several rounds of staff cuts at its newspapers and bureau in recent years. Some have left in protest of changes in editorial practices aimed at boosting revenue, Clark said. ""There's been one editor after another that's walked out the door because they didn't want to cave in to pressure from the top to do the wrong thing,"" Clark said. What he might have objected to five years ago, he could now accept it helps papers survive, Clark said. But not if it confuses editorial content with ads, he said. ""Every time I see a big ad in my local newspaper I send up a little cheer,"" he said. When HBO paid the newspaper for a wrap-around ad last summer, for the vampire series ""True Blood,"" it was not mixed with the flag or editorial content. The Los Angeles Times drew criticism in April when it sold NBC the right column of its front page, where a lead story is normally placed. The network used the space to advertise the debut of its ""Southland"" series.","Los Angeles Times' ""Alice in Wonderland"" ad uses two real stories published last month .

"Paris, France (CNN) -- France has denied citizenship to a man because he allegedly forced his wife to wear a full Islamic veil, the French immigration minister said in a statement Wednesday. The man was applying for citizenship in order to join his French wife in France, Immigration Minister Eric Besson said. The man was refused citizenship because he was depriving his wife of the liberty to come and go with her face uncovered, Besson said. The decision, made Tuesday, came exactly a week after a French parliamentary commission recommended a partial ban on any veils that cover the face -- including the burqa, the full-body covering worn by some Muslim women. The ban -- which has not yet come up for a vote -- would apply in public places like hospitals and schools, and on public transport, the commission announced. Foreigners may become French citizens if they marry French nationals and meet certain criteria, including integrating well in French society and having ""good morality,"" Besson said. It is on the criteria of morality that the man's citizenship request was denied, Besson said. ""This individual imposes the full veil upon his wife, does not allow her the freedom to go and come as she pleases, and bans her from going out with her face unveiled, and rejects the principles of secularism and equality between man and woman,"" Besson said he told President Nicolas Sarkozy. France's top court denied a Moroccan woman's naturalization request in 2008 on the grounds that she wore a burqa. Sarkozy controversially told lawmakers six months ago that the traditional Muslim burqa was ""not welcome"" in France. He said the issue is one of a woman's freedom and dignity, and did not have to do with religion. France has relatively tight controls on religion, according to the Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. It has among the most severe government restrictions on religion in Western Europe, as well as some of the highest levels of social tension involving religion, Pew senior researcher Brian Grim told CNN. More than half of French people support a full ban veils, according to a recent opinion poll. The Ipsos poll for Le Point magazine found 57 percent of French people said it should be illegal to appear in public wearing clothes that cover the face. That's despite government estimates that fewer than 2,000 women in the country actually wear the full Islamic veil. France has about 3.5 million Muslims, representing about 6 percent of the population, according to Pew Forum research. The country does not collect its own statistics on religion in accordance with laws enshrining France's status as a secular state. France already has a law against Muslim girls wearing headscarves in state schools. It sparked widespread Muslim protests when the French Parliament passed the law in 2004, even though the law also bans other conspicuous religious symbols including Sikh turbans, large Christian crucifixes and Jewish skull caps. CNN's Jessica Hartogs in London, England, contributed to this report .","Immigration Minister says man denied wife liberty of coming going with face uncovered .

"New York (CNN) -- A New York judge Friday postponed a decision on a proposed $657 million settlement for people who became ill after working on the World Trade Center site after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The settlement, announced Thursday, would cover about 10,000 plaintiffs, said Marc Bern, one of the lawyers representing the workers. The postponement appeared to take attorneys -- and Mayor Michael Bloomberg -- by surprise. Attorneys for both sides and the mayor earlier made statements assuming the proposal would be approved by U.S. District Judge Alvin Hellerstein. The judge is particularly interested in making sure the attorneys' cut of the settlement is equitable for all parties. ""This will not be a giveaway,"" Hellerstein said Friday. ""This will be a fair and just settlement."" Christine LaSala, president of WTC Captive Insurance Co., which announced the settlement, repeated after the judge's announcement a statement issued Thursday night. ""This agreement enables workers and volunteers claiming injury from the WTC site operations to obtain compensation commensurate with the nature of their injuries and the strength of their claims, while offering added protection against possible future illness,"" she said. The agreement comes after six years of legal wrangling -- a sometimes excruciating wait for his clients, Bern said. Many of his clients worked rescuing victims from the terrorist attacks or removing debris after the World Trade Center toppled. After the work, some found their health deteriorated, with many suffering from asthma, other respiratory issues and blood cancer, Bern told CNN Radio. ""I am quite gratified that we been able to reach a settlement for the heroes of 9/11,"" said Bern. ""The men and women who were exposed at the site have waited a long time for some type of resolution."" The WTC Captive Insurance Co. announced the settlement on Thursday. ""This agreement enables workers and volunteers claiming injury from the WTC site operations to obtain compensation commensurate with the nature of their injuries and the strength of their claims, while offering added protection against possible future illness,"" the organization said in a statement. WTC Captive was created with a $1 billion FEMA grant and provides insurance coverage to the City of New York and its debris-removal contractors. In the aftermath of 9/11, New York was unable to get adequate amounts of liability insurance for the rescue, recovery and debris-removal work done at the World Trade Center site. The settlement would provide a system to pay for the compensation of the injury claims made by workers. This would include construction workers, firefighters, police officers and other workers and volunteers. The settlement would also fund a special insurance policy, which provides additional compensation to any plaintiff contracting certain types of cancer in the future. The settlement agreement will be presented to a judge Friday morning who then could give preliminary approval of it by afternoon, Bern said. If the judge gives his OK, Bern's law firm will send letters to the plaintiffs to tell them what money they are eligible for. ""The payments could range from thousands of dollars to nearly $2 million for clients,"" Bern said. In order to make a claim, plaintiffs will have to submit proof they were present and participated in the post-9/11 efforts. They will also have to present specific medical documentation, including a diagnosis confirming their illness or injury. New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said of the resolution, ""This settlement is a fair and reasonable resolution to a complex set of circumstances. Since September 11th, the city has moved aggressively to provide medical treatment to those who were present at Ground Zero, and we will continue our commitment to treatment and monitoring."" A spokesman for the mayor declined further comment. After the 9/11 attacks, individuals who worked or volunteered in the rescue, recovery and debris-removal project were entitled to and have received free medical care, which has been funded by the City of New York and the federal government. Participating in the settlement would not deter access to that care. Former New York firefighter Kenny Specht told CNN's Campbell Brown, ""You really can't put a price on your health, so I hope that this settlement was done the right way and I hope that it was done with people's health and safety and future in mind."" Specht, 37, was diagnosed with thyroid cancer in 2008. CNN's Jamie Guzzardo and Patty Lane contributed to this report.","NEW: .

Branding is a buzzword that has worked its way into the permanent lexicon. Companies, organizations and individuals want to have a brand -- an identity that customers instantly recognize and respond to positively. Much of that branding is formed online via ad campaigns, press and customer interaction. Branding consultants help companies identify what type of brand they want. They then help create it and keep it consistent through all outlets. They know the likes and dislikes of their target audience so they try to be in front of them as much as possible to get exposure and gauge their reactions. The placement of banner ads, the spread of viral videos and other places you see a company's advertisements are the results of branding consultants' efforts. Public relations director . The world of PR is busy and ever-changing. In fact, what you do as a public relations specialist or director depends on the organization in which you work. What is the same everywhere is the need to monitor what type of media attention you're getting and employ damage control if necessary. Directors give interviews online, in print, on radio and on TV to speak on the company's behalf. They stay on message so the company presents a cohesive voice at all times. Directors also monitor what publications and critics, both online and offline, are saying about the company and are prepared to respond to all inquiries that come their way. Recruiter .

Of course, good recruiters want the right candidate, so they spend hours scouring different networks to find the most qualified individuals. Social media consultant . Social media is still relatively new in the business world, as is this position. In some companies, a social media consultant is a busy, high-level job. In others, it's a part-time gig suited for an intern. What you can be certain of is the need to find new ways to engage customers online. Companies need someone to set up and maintain accounts on Twitter, Facebook, MySpace and any other social media site that pops up. The social media consultant might work for a public relations director or alongside a branding consultant. Whatever the case, this person needs to keep the content fresh, monitor user feedback and create a persona for the company -- all through the click of a mouse. User operations analyst .

"NEW DELHI, India (CNN) -- A Maoist group has claimed responsibility for the killing of a Hindu leader, whose death sparked a wave of Hindu-Christian riots in southern India. Indian nuns protest against the recent violence which has seen Christians attacked. Sabyasachi Panda, the head of the Communist Party of India-Maoist, told reporters of two private television stations that his group was behind the Hindu leader's death, the country's national news agency said Sunday. The leader, Laxmananda Saraswati, preached the tenets of Hinduism to the tribal people of the state. And Panda said Maoists had earlier warned him to desist from ""such works"" or face consequences, PTI said. Panda said the Maoists killed Saraswati because he was ""spreading social unrest"" in the tribal area, the news agency said. The Indian government has consistently claimed the shooting death may have been the work of Maoist rebels. But hardline Hindu groups blamed the state's Christian minority for Saraswati's death. He and four others were killed in August when 20 to 30 gunmen barged into a Hindu school and began shooting. Afterward, police arrested five Christians as suspects in the case. The hardliners held up the arrests as proof of Christian complicity. They took to the streets in anger, rampaging through predominantly Christian neighborhoods, ransacking shops and torching houses. A Christian orphanage was set on fire. A 20-year-old woman, who was teaching children inside, burned to death. Christian resident fought back, and the clashes spread. The communal violence left churches and temples razed to the ground. More than 20 people died, and hundreds were arrested. Even after the Maoists' claim of responsibility, some fundamentalist Hindu groups blamed Christians for the death. The hardline Vishwa Hindu Parishad, or World Hindu Council rejected the claim saying the communist group -- known as 'Naxals' -- did not have a religious agenda. ""Have the Maoists started fighting in the name of God now?"" VHP leader Subansh Chauhan was quoted as saying by CNN-IBN, CNN's sister network. The rebels, who claim to be fighting for the poor and the dispossessed, have been battling the government in an insurgency that has resulted in thousands of casualties since the late 1960s. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has called Naxalism India's biggest security threat. Last year, more than 800 people were killed in Naxal-related violence across the country, according to local media reports.

"(CNN)  -- They have titles like ""El Secreto de Sus Ojos,"" ""No Puedo Vivir sin Ti"" and ""Casanegra."" They're directed by auteurs with names like Paresh Mokashi and Giuseppe Tornatore. They've been selected from hundreds, sometimes thousands, of entries from countries like South Korea, Venezuela and Bangladesh. And some experts say they don't have the slightest chance of winning the Oscar for best picture. Certainly not this year. No foreign language films were nominated in the best picture category. The foreign language film category at the Academy Awards is one of the most respected worldwide, Academy executive director Bruce Davis said. The category was launched in the late 1940s, when it became clear that European and Asian nations were creating incredible films. Every year, each of more than 60 countries around the world selects one film to send to the Academy for consideration -- kind of like the Olympics for filmmakers. The Oscar is then awarded, not to the filmmakers, but to the winning country. ""A better analogy is [soccer's] World Cup,"" Davis said. ""You only get to submit one team to the World Cup and filmmakers have to decide within countries what they're going to send. Even India, which makes thousands of films a year, can only send one."" See list of Oscar nominees -- including foreign language films . Richard Brody, a film critic for The New Yorker, thinks the nomination process is peculiar and leads to some strange films being selected by certain governments. For example, ""We're not likely to see the best of Chinese cinema because it tends to be critical of Chinese government,"" he said. A film must have predominantly non-English dialogue to be included in the foreign language film category. Yet any film submitted is also eligible for other categories, as long as it has been shown in a Los Angeles, California, theater for one week. The French film ""Z"" won an Oscar for film editing in 1969; it was also nominated for best picture, directing and writing. In 1972 the Swedish film ""The Emigrants"" was nominated for best picture, best actress, directing and writing. In 2000, the best picture nominee ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon"" from China won for art direction, cinematography and best score. Yet no foreign language film has ever won best picture. ""I do understand why the Academy is looking first to American films,"" Brody said. ""It's an Academy that's centered around Hollywood."" Davis equates it with any other country's film awards -- if you watch the British Film Awards you'll see mostly British films win; if you watch France's Cesar Awards, you'll see mostly French films win. The Academy chose 10 nominees in the best picture category, up from five in past years.  Foreign film lovers had hoped it would open up the category to their favorite picks. ""I'm a great fan of many foreign filmmakers,"" Davis said. ""There have been years that, if they only counted my ballot, ... a foreign film would have won."" David Wallechinsky has a good grasp on the foreign language film nominees for this year -- he's already seen 47 of the 65 submitted. With a DVD collection including films from 105 countries, he's watched the gamut of foreign films from artsy to action-packed. And his pick this year wasn't the nominated German film, ""The White Ribbon."" It's the French film ""Un Prophete,"" by director Jacques Audiard -- which also was nominated. ""The 'Prophete' is way better than most of the movies in the U.S.,"" Wallechinsky said. ""It's definitely better than 'Inglourious Basterds.' Even a film that was good like 'The Hurt Locker' -- that was a good film, I have no problem with that film -- 'Prophete' is still a better film."" Brody believes a film's Oscar win has less to do with its superior quality than with its commercial success. He says last year's winner, ""Slumdog Millionaire,"" which grossed more than $141 million at U.S. theaters, might not have done as well if it was a foreign language film. ""Slumdog Millionaire"" swept the 81st Academy Awards with eight Oscars, including best picture, director and adapted screenplay. But would it have won best picture if it hadn't been shot in English and released in the U.S.? ""In a word, no,"" Wallechnisky said. ""There are lots of people who will only see a film in English. I know very educated, very sophisticated people who just cannot handle subtitles."" Still, with U.S. companies increasingly embracing the global economy, more Hollywood flicks are being filmed overseas. The lines are blurring between American and foreign -- Japanese anime is popular in the U.S., as are Asian action films and British comedies. Davis says he can imagine a future when the lines won't exist at all. ""I think it would be great to think of a day when there is no need for a foreign language category. I'd love it, but I don't think we're quite there yet.""","No foreign language film has ever won the Oscar for best picture .
Sixty-five nations submitted foreign language films for consideration this year .

"(CNN) -- Dr. Rajiv Shah President Obama announced Wednesday that Shah, the 36-year-old administrator of the U.S. Agency for International Development, will be in charge of the overall U.S. relief effort in Haiti. ""The goal of the relief effort in the first 72 hours will be very focused on saving lives,"" Shah said. At Shah's USAID swearing-in ceremony on January 7, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said, ""One only needs to ask his wife, Shivam, the lengths to which Raj will go to achieve important goals. After all, this is a man who flew to India for one day to propose to her at the Taj Mahal when she was traveling there alone. This is also a man who summited the 14,400-foot Mount Rainier -- one of the most difficult climbs in the continental United States, and it combines the challenges of an unforgiving glacier with the unpredictability of an active volcano. That may be the best preparation Raj has for working in Washington these days."" According to his USAID biography, Shah, a medical doctor and health economist, was an under-secretary at the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Prior to joining the Obama administration, Shah served as director of agricultural development at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In 2001, Shah was the health care policy adviser on the Gore 2000 presidential campaign and a member of Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell's transition committee on health. In addition, he has served as a policy aide in the British Parliament and worked at the World Health Organization. USAid.gov: Biography of Dr. Rajiv Shah .

I have heard that they are OK, but I do not know what is going on around them."" Jean-Louis was born in Petionville, Haiti, where he grew up without electricity or running water. He moved to Paris, France, when he was 12 to pursue a modeling career and had supported his parents by sending money home since he started acting nearly 20 years ago.

Pat Robertson The evangelical Christian, who once suggested God was punishing Americans with Hurricane Katrina, says a ""pact to the devil"" brought on the devastating earthquake in Haiti. Officials fear more than 100,000 people have died as a result of Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude earthquake in Haiti. Robertson, the host of the ""700 Club,"" blamed the tragedy on something that ""happened a long time ago in Haiti, and people might not want to talk about it."" The Haitians ""were under the heel of the French. You know, Napoleon III and whatever,"" Robertson said on his broadcast Wednesday. ""And they got together and swore a pact to the devil. They said, 'We will serve you if you will get us free from the French.' True story. And so, the devil said, 'OK, it's a deal.'

Ted Kennedy's term. Groups outside of the state are supporting the two candidates to the tune of millions of dollars. Brown is hoping to become the first Massachusetts Republican to win a U.S. Senate seat since 1972. Independent Joseph Kennedy, a third party candidate who is not related to the late senator, is also in the race. The Boston Globe endorsed Coakley on Wednesday, saying the state's current attorney general is more qualified to serve in Washington than her Republican opponent.

Pendergrass, known for smash-hit love ballads such as ""Turn Off the Lights"" and ""Love TKO,"" died after a long illness, according to Lisa Barbaris, who described herself as a close friend and his last publicist. His family did not reveal details about his illness, but said it was related to complications from a 1982 car accident, Barbaris said. The crooner, affectionately known as just ""Teddy"" by many fans, started in music with a group called the Cadillacs in the late 1960s and was still with the group when it merged with Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes, according to his official Web site. He began as a drummer, but soon became the lead singer after the group heard his powerful voice. In 1972, Pendergrass' baritone could be heard on the classic Harold Melvin and the Blue Notes song ""If You Don't Know Me by Now."" After going solo, Pendergrass received several Grammy nominations, Billboard's 1977 Pop Album New Artist Award, and an American Music Award for best R&B performer of 1978, Barbaris said. In 1982, Pendergrass was involved in a car accident that left him paralyzed. But he returned to the studio in 1984 in his wheelchair to record an album. Before his death, Pendergrass was working on a musical documenting his life, called ""I Am Who I Am."" CNN: R&B singer Teddy Pendergrass dies at 59 . What makes a person intriguing?

"(CNN) -- A preliminary autopsy on the body of an energy executive pulled from the Mississippi River in New Orleans, Louisiana, this week revealed a head laceration and evidence of drowning, investigators said Thursday. The body was found Tuesday, four days after Douglas Schantz, president of Houston, Texas-based Sequent Energy Management, disappeared. A toxicology report, due back in roughly three weeks, will show ""how much Schantz had to drink before falling into the Mississippi"" last week, said John Gagliano, lead investigator at the New Orleans coroner's office. Authorities recovered Schantz's body around noon Tuesday, said police spokesman Gary Flot. Police said Schantz was found with all his personal belongings, including his wallet, credit cards, identification and jewelry. Schantz, 54, was last seen outside a Bourbon Street bar at 2:06 a.m. Friday, New Orleans Police Superintendent Warren Riley told reporters Tuesday morning. No one had heard from him since then. At the Tuesday morning news conference, Riley said detectives reviewed video from ""almost every"" business in the busy French Quarter. Several cameras captured a ""disoriented"" Schantz walking alone from a bar toward the Mississippi River, Riley said. Schantz had been drinking, Riley said, and was headed toward a boat at the wharf. ""The last video of Mr. Schantz is when he was near the boat Natchez, walking on a 2- to 3-foot-wide walkway near the river,"" Riley said. ""From 2:40 until 6:40 a.m. video was watched and ... once he [Schantz] walked out of that frame near the Natchez, he never returned on any frames of the video."" Riley said that according to the video, no one approached Schantz during the walk. Texas Equusearch, a search-and-rescue team, searched the waters with sonar equipment, and the Coast Guard and Harbor Police had also joined the search, according to Riley. Family and friends said they knew something was wrong Friday morning when Schantz didn't show up at the airport, missed a company meeting, and didn't return calls. Such behavior, they said, was uncharacteristic of him. ""There's never been a time he was out of reach,"" said Pete Tumminello, vice president of Sequent Energy, on Monday. ""I've worked with him for seven years. There's never been a time he's been out of reach."" Schantz missed a flight Friday morning with his daughter, a Tulane University senior, police said. He also did not show up for an office meeting in Houston. Schantz went to the French Quarter with friends on Thursday night, Sequent Energy spokesman Alan Chapple told CNN on Tuesday. They went there after an earlier event at Tulane University to present a $25,000 donation to the Tulane Energy Institute, Chapple said. Schantz and his colleagues had dinner with professors and students at the school, and later he and some others went to the bar. Schantz was staying at the Royal Sonesta Hotel, only about two blocks from the bar that he was seen leaving, Chapple said. Members of the party had left the establishment at varying times, he said. During their investigation, police had not discovered any evidence of a crime, Flot said Tuesday morning. The FBI, U.S. Marshals Service and private investigators were also working the case, Riley said. Schantz's son, Michael, described Monday the agony his family was feeling as they awaited news. ""My family is distraught, I'm distraught, [in] shock,"" he said. ""We just want him found alive and back with our family.""

"(CNN) -- When Nelson Mandela stepped out of South Africa's Victor Verster prison a free man 20 years ago Thursday, he was his country's most famous freedom fighter. Black South Africans and other opponents of apartheid lined streets to see him when he was released, cheering wildly and waving flags. He was a hero, imprisoned for 27 years for the crime of opposing a government that sought to enforce severe segregation laws with brutality. Once free, Mandela worked with South Africa's white president, F.W. de Klerk to end those policies, knocking down the pillars of segregation one at a time. Three years after his release from prison, Mandela and de Klerk shared the Nobel Peace Prize. The African National Congress -- once again legal after being banned in 1961 -- elected Mandela as its president, and he won South Africa's presidential election in a landslide in 1994, the country's first black president. ""We dedicate this day to all the heroes and heroines in this country and the rest of the world who sacrificed in many ways and surrendered their lives so that we could be free,"" he said in his inauguration speech. ""Their dreams have become reality. Freedom is their reward. We are both humbled and elevated by the honor and privilege that you, the people of South Africa, have bestowed on us, as the first President of a united, democratic, non-racial and non-sexist government."" And he kept his promise to serve but one term. Already in prison when convicted of treason in 1964 and given a life sentence, Mandela was a living symbol of the struggle against South Africa's racist apartheid system enacted when he was 30 years old. But the African National Congress leader fought for justice long before the National Party's 1948 election and subsequent introduction of apartheid. And in his last public words before he was whisked off to jail, Mandela spoke of his own dream. ""I have fought against white domination, and I have fought against black domination,"" he said. ""I have cherished the ideal of a democratic and free society in which all persons will live together in harmony, and with equal opportunities. It is an ideal which I hope to live for, and to see realized. But if needs be, it is an ideal for which I am prepared to die."" Rolihlahla Mandela was always meant for great things, but his name -- it means ""pulling the branch of a tree"" or, colloquially ""troublemaker,"" in the Xhosa language -- foreshadowed how that greatness would manifest. Born into a Thembu royal family -- but the wrong branch to be considered in line for the throne -- Mandela was the first of his family to attend school, where a teacher gave him the name ""Nelson."" He even went to college but was tossed out at the end of his first year for protesting school policies. And he ran away to Johannesburg, where he finished college and began law studies, to escape an arranged marriage. But 1948 focused Mandela's life like nothing before. First organizing non-violent resistance to apartheid policies, Mandela and his ANC cohorts were nevertheless hounded -- arrested, beaten, followed, spied upon -- by the government. When the ANC was formally banned in 1961, the group realized that non-violence wasn't working. ""It was only when all else had failed, when all channels of peaceful protest had been barred to us, that the decision was made to embark on violent forms of political struggle,"" he said in court. "" ... the government had left us no other choice."" Prior to his imprisonment, Mandela was anything but a free man, traveling incognito, organizing the business of the African National Congress without having to bring its members together in one place where they would be vulnerable to government action, spending days and weeks away from his family. Even before his release, Mandela had moved beyond freedom fighter to statesman, a position he still holds despite retiring from public life in 2004 to spend more time with his family. He spoke out for democracy, human rights and peace. He fought against AIDS but admitted he probably could have done more to stop the spread of the disease. He created foundations to carry on his legacy, spoke around the world and tirelessly told the world that the end of apartheid was not his doing but the work of many others who shared the same dream. But Mandela is not remembered simply for ending apartheid. He was also behind reconciliation, a painful and lengthy process that attempted to hold those responsible for the brutality accountable for their acts without alienating the other white South Africans. In nearly every speech, Mandela pushed this concept. He urged black South Africans to support the South African national rugby team -- hated by many blacks because they viewed it as the sport of their oppressors -- in 1995. And when the team won the 1995 Rugby World Cup, team captain Francois Pienaar received the trophy from the president himself, wearing a duplicate of Pienaar's jersey. Pienaar, after the release of the movie ""Invictus"" that tells the story, said of his first meeting with Mandela -- when the president described his plan to use the team to help bring white and black south Africa together -- ""I left that first meeting with the feeling that we were in good hands in South Africa. I felt safe with him."" And Mandela was instrumental in bringing soccer's World Cup to South Africa -- finally arriving this year, six years after soccer's world body awarded the event. Now 91, Mandela rests in the company of his family, including his third wife, Graca Machel. The accolades have been heaped upon him. He is a hero to his people, and to much of the world. But 15 years into democracy, South Africa still faces rife poverty, unemployment and crime. Many people do not enjoy the benefits of freedom -- there is more to be done, but no one pretends otherwise. ""I've been amazed that they haven't said to hell with Mandela and Tutu and all these people who talk about reconciliation and go on a rampage,"" Anglican Archbishop Desmond Tutu said of the patience of South Africa's poor. Tutu also won a Nobel Peace Prize -- in 1984 -- and was one of many who carried on Mandela's work through the late 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s. He was chairman of the Truth and Reconciliation Committee and is now chairman of The Elders, a group he, Mandela and Machel founded to provide a mechanism for world leaders to share their wisdom. F.W. de Klerk is not a member of that group. But he recognizes both the transformative work he and Mandela did in the 1990s and the troubles the country still faces. ""We have averted a catastrophe, the new South Africa with all these big problems is a much better place than it would have been had we not taken the initiatives we did in the early 1990s,"" he said. ""We are back in the international community; we play a positive good role on the problematic continent of Africa. So life is good but not for the poor."" And no one is more keenly aware of those ""big problems"" than Rolihlahla Nelson Mandela, now known fondly in South Africa by his clan name, Madiba. He saw it clearly in 1994, when his autobiography, ""Long Walk to Freedom,"" was published. ""I have traveled this long road to freedom,"" he wrote. ""I trust I did not falter. I made missteps along the way. But I have discovered the secret that, after crossing a great hill, one only finds that there are many more hills to cross."" Twenty years ago, there was no freedom for Mandela, no freedom for black South Africans. There may be more hills to cross, but those black South Africans are no longer strangers to freedom.","Mandela was convicted of treason in 1964, given a life sentence .

"(CNN) -- The U.S. government warned consumers Sunday to avoid oysters from San Antonio Bay in Texas after investigators found the oysters caused a highly contagious virus. Consumers who bought San Antonio Bay-harvested oysters on or after November 16 should throw them away, the Food and Drug Administration announced. The agency also advised restaurant managers and grocers not to serve or sell the Texas oysters. About a dozen cases of norovirus-related illnesses in North Carolina and South Carolina were ""definitely linked"" to oysters recently harvested from the San Antonio Bay, FDA spokeswoman Rita Chappelle told CNN. Texas' health department has already recalled all oysters harvested from the bay between November 16 and November 25, the health department said in a statement on its Web site. San Antonio Bay has also been closed to commercial oyster harvesting, the statement said. Texas authorities are still investigating how the oysters were contaminated and where they were distributed, Chappelle said. Noroviruses cause gastroenteritis, also known as the stomach flu. They are highly contagious, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Aside from contracting the virus from food or drink, one can become ill by touching contaminated surfaces and then their mouth, or by coming into direct contact with an infected individual. Symptoms associated with the virus include nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramping. Affected individuals often experience low-grade fever, chills, headache, muscle aches and fatigue. The illness typically lasts one to two days according to the CDC. Anyone who ate the now-recalled oysters and who are now showing symptoms of norovirus should see a doctor and contact the local health department.

"(CNN) -- Four days after Haiti's massive earthquake, efforts are under way to bury the dead as thousands of bodies crumpled in the streets of Port-au-Prince lay exposed to the sun or draped in sheets and cardboard. Throughout the city, people covered their noses from the stench and some resorted to face masks. CNN correspondents in Haiti reported efforts to remove the bodies, including the creation of a mass grave. It's still unclear how many people have been killed in Tuesday's earthquake; the prime minister suggested there could be several hundreds of thousands. CNN's Anderson Cooper, reporting Friday from a mass grave on the outskirts of Port-au-Prince, described seeing hundreds of bodies mixed with garbage in open pits. Some bodies were bulldozed into the half-filled pits. ""These people will vanish,"" Cooper said in a phone report. ""No one will know what happened to them. That's one of the many horrors. ""There's no system in place here. Literally these people here are being collected off the streets, dumped into a dump truck, then brought out here and dumped in the pits,"" he said. The fear of disease is frequently the reason for rapidly burying bodies in mass graves. But contrary to popular belief, bodies do not cause epidemics after natural disasters, experts said. ""The reality is that most of the disease that live in us -- once our body is dead they can't survive very long,"" said Oliver Morgan, an epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Fecal matter from the deceased could contaminate the water supply, posing a risk, but ""it's nowhere near the risk of all the survivors living in the streets with no sanitation,"" said Morgan, who contributed to the World Health Organization's guidelines on managing bodies after a natural disaster. There has never been an epidemic after a natural disaster that was traced to exposure to bodies, according to the WHO. The chief priority must lie with the living, experts said. ""Body collection is not the most urgent task after a natural disaster,"" according to the WHO's 2006 guidance on the Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters. ""The priority is to care for survivors. There is no significant public health risk associated with the presence of bodies. Nevertheless, bodies should be collected as soon as possible and taken away for identification."" Mass graves, it warned, are ""not justified on public health grounds. Rushing to dispose of bodies without proper identification traumatizes families and communities and may have serious legal consequences."" ""There's always talks about mass graves because that's always the easiest solution,"" said Frank Ciaccio, vice president of commercial services at Kenyon International Emergency Services, a disaster management company that responds to mass fatality accidents. ""We don't strongly recommend them. However, sometimes in situations in very developing nations, that's the only thing to do."" In cases of mass graves, teams should at least document or photograph the individual for future identification, he said. Kenyon has deployed an emergency response assessment team to Haiti. Ciaccio was part of the crew that responded to the tsunami in Southeast Asia in 2004 and New Orleans, Louisiana, after Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Having bodies on the street is very distressing to survivors. ""That's going to be very stressful,"" Ciaccio said. ""It's hot temperatures and that's not a pleasant sight. There's decomposed bodies. And the hotter the weather, the quicker the decomposition."" Decomposition starts as early as the day of death, bringing stench and pests. ""When you have bodies on the street that begin to decompose, you eventually get maggot infestation because of flies and you have a potential of rats,"" said Vernie Fountain, the disaster task force leader of the National Funeral Directors Association. At one of the capital city's cemeteries, people opened up old crypts and shoved corpses of quake victims into them before resealing them. Workers loaded bodies -- piled on the sides of roads -- into the basket of a front-loader tractor, which then deposited them into blood-stained dump trucks, according to CNN correspondents in Haiti. ""There's little dignity in death in Port-au-Prince these days,"" Cooper said in his report. The United States is deploying mortuary teams to identify and bury the dead in a public safety rescue mission, Kathleen Sebelius, secretary of Health and Human Services, said Thursday. After huge disasters, mortuary teams often face logistical nightmares, working with little resources, thousands of bodies, collapsed infrastructure, language barriers and different cultural and religious views. After working in the aftermath of landslides, cyclones, hurricanes and tsunamis with mass fatalities, Morgan realized the lack of a guidelines for handling the bodies was a recurring problem. ""What we often see are these pictures of mass graves which are dug three feet deep with hundreds of bodies thrown into this large hole,"" Morgan said. ""That's discouraged in preference to having a more organized situation with a long trench grave and putting bodies in an ordered way, or marked graves so people know where the victims are buried."" One possible solution is to move the bodies to a temporary, organized collection point and to gather as much information to help with future identification, said Fountain, who served as a national officer for Disaster Mortuary Operational Response Team, a national response team designed to provide mortuary assistance in mass fatality incidents. After the tsunami killed 225,000 people in 2004, various Southeast Asian countries handled the dead differently based on location and available resources. While none of the countries affected by the tsunami had enough refrigerated storage to handle the corpses, many found alternatives by burying the dead in temporary, shallow graves with the intent to exhume them later. Other bodies were hastily buried within 24 hours in mass graves. ""The parallels are mass fatalities and catastrophic events,"" Ciaccio said. ""We have a significant loss of life; we have people that are unknown; we have a significant number of missing people. The one minor difference in Thailand was that it was isolated to shoreline about a mile in. Here you have total destruction of an infrastructure system.""","CNN's Anderson Cooper reported on a mass grave with hundreds of bodies .

"(CNN) -- The military is investigating a ""shocking and deplorable"" YouTube video that seems to show a Marine throwing a puppy off a rocky cliff. YouTube.com removed the video for violating the Web site's terms of use. The black-and-white puppy makes a yelping sound as it flies through the air. ""That's mean, that was mean,"" one companion says off-camera, addressing the alleged puppy thrower by his last name. The fate of the animal is not known. The Marine is identified on the video and in other Internet postings as a lance corporal stationed at Marine Corps Base Hawaii in Kaneohe. It's not clear where the video was shot, although the man who appears to throw the puppy and another Marine are in full combat gear with helmets. YouTube.com had taken down the video by 12:30 p.m. ET Tuesday ""due to terms of use violation,"" according to a banner on the Web site. ""This is a shocking and deplorable video that is contrary to the high standards that we set for every Marine,"" Marine Corps spokesman Maj. Chris Perrine said at a news conference Monday night. ""We will investigate this and take appropriate actions,"" Perrine said.  Watch other Marines and civilians react to the video » . He said the Marine is being kept safe in view of the anger over the alleged incident. Perrine added that the majority of Marines conduct themselves honorably. ""There are many examples of Marines who adopt pets and bring them back from Iraq and demonstrate their compassion on a daily basis,"" he said. If the video is deemed legitimate, the lance corporal could face a charge of conduct unbecoming a Marine, Perrine said. There could be administrative action, nonjudicial punishment or a court-martial, he added. ""It's all governed by the Uniform Code of Military Justice, and anything from reduction in pay to reduction in rank to confinement to discharge from the Marine Corps"" is possible, Perrine said. If others are involved, they too will be disciplined, he said. ""Certainly, there's a lot of outrage, and a lot of people are upset about it.

"(CNN) -- Space shuttle astronaut Randy Bresnik has welcomed a daughter -- from space. Bresnik is part of the crew on the space shuttle Atlantis, currently docked with the International Space Station. Bresnik called Mission Control at 6:14 a.m. ET Sunday to announce the birth of Abigail Mae Bresnik about seven hours earlier, according to the NASA Web site on the shuttle mission. The baby weighed 6 pounds, 13 ounces and was 20 inches long. ""Just wanted to take this opportunity to report some good news,"" Bresnik said, according to a NASA transcript. ""At 11:04 last night, Abigail Mae Bresnik joined the NASA family, and mama and baby are doing very well."" Bresnik had private communication channels arranged in advance for the birth, the agency said. Atlantis lifted off Monday on a mission to deliver parts to the international space station. ""I think like most parents, I would prefer to be there at the birth for sure, but we don't pick this timing and so it's ... a little bit disappointing not to see her in person right when she enters the world,"" Bresnik said in a preflight interview, a transcript of which is posted on the NASA Web site. ""But fortunately, through the wonders of modern technical advancements and our amazing communication systems on the ISS and space shuttle, hopefully I'll be able to hear and see the pictures and be able to talk with her maybe on the IP phone and see some video shortly thereafter and be home only a few days afterwards."" NASA did not disclose the location of Bresnik's wife and daughter, citing privacy concerns. The couple already has a 3-year-old son, whom they adopted from Ukraine a year ago, Bresnik said. Bresnik's wife echoed his mixed feelings in the preflight interview. ""I'm a little disappointed that he won't be able to be there, but understanding that we don't choose the timing, and [I'm] excited for him that he's doing what he's doing,"" said Rebecca Bresnik, a NASA attorney. She said labor was being induced two weeks early for medical reasons, ""so we're able to play with the date a little bit."" The shuttle crew was awakened Sunday morning by the song ""Butterfly Kisses,"" which was selected for Bresnik, NASA said. The song, by Bob Carlisle, is about a man and his daughter. It was the second time a baby has been born to a U.S. astronaut who was on a space mission. Mike Fincke's daughter was born in June 2004 while he was aboard the international space station, NASA said. Bresnik and astronaut Robert Satcher Jr. were gearing up Sunday for a third and final spacewalk, planned for Monday. The two will prepare spacesuits and tools Sunday, along with reviewing the updated procedures, NASA said. The spacewalk was replanned overnight after Bresnik and Mike Foreman were able to get ahead during a spacewalk Saturday, according to NASA. The shuttle is scheduled to land on Friday.

"CLARENCE CENTER, New York (CNN)  -- The pilots of a commuter airliner that crashed late Thursday about 6 miles from a Buffalo, New York, airport discussed ""significant ice buildup"" on the plane's wings and windshields before the plane plunged to the ground, killing 50. Only a few pieces of the Continental Connection Dash 8 turboprop were recognizable after the crash. Continental Connection Flight 3407 was en route from Newark, New Jersey, to Buffalo Niagara International Airport when it went down about 10:20 p.m. ET Thursday. Preliminary information recovered from the flight's cockpit voice and data recorders indicated that the plane underwent ""severe"" pitching and rolling motions after the landing gear was lowered and wing flaps were set for the approach, Steve Chealander of the National Transportation Safety Board said Friday afternoon. ""The crew discussed significant ice buildup, ice on the windshield and leading edge of the wings,"" Chealander said. ""The crew attempted to raise the gear and [reset] flaps shortly before the recordings ended,"" he said. iReport.com: Are you there? Let us know . The plane crashed into a home in Buffalo, killing all 49 people aboard and one person on the ground. Firefighters brought under control a blaze at the crash site on Friday, blaming a natural gas leak for the fire's persistence.

The first sign the air traffic controllers had of trouble was when Flight 3407 went off the radar. Before that, it had been business as usual. The first officer, who was the co-pilot, had no sign of stress in her voice as she talked with air traffic control. The plane was cleared for approach. About a minute later, the air traffic controller said that contact with the plane had been lost and asked whether crews in other aircraft could see anything. No one responded. The controller then said there might be a plane down. Although there was a mix of sleet and snow in the area, other planes landed safely at the airport about the time the flight went down.  Watch what weather was like when disaster happened » . The crew of a Delta flight reported rime icing, a condition in which ice quickly builds up on the leading edge of the wings.

"CHENNAI, India (CNN) -- Sipping a sweet lime juice on the rooftop bar of a designer hotel in Chennai, Vinod Harith looks the epitome of a relaxed, confident young Indian entrepreneur. High hopes: Vinod, left, and Pramod Harith set up thier marketing outsourcing company. But setting up his marketing outsourcing company just seven months ago was far from a relaxing experience. It's a recent memory that still provokes a momentary look of discomfort. ""It was just painful,"" he says with a wry smile. It seems that despite the potential riches to be had by tapping in to all the talent, energy and potential in India, going it alone is still a unique experience in the country, even for those who are used to working there. Multinational companies may be finding their path into the world of Indian business smooth, but that official approach hasn't trickled down to India's burgeoning business brains with billionaire aspirations. ""If you're a large company trying to set up a subsidiary and you want to set up in India, a lot of that bureaucracy has gone away, but not for an entrepreneur,"" says Harith who previously worked for Wipro Technologies. From getting a bank account to securing a line of credit, the same rigid attitude from officialdom remains with decisions made at a glacial place. ""The government ministry has not been so fast to change. It's become easier, but still a lot of that thinking has not gone away,"" he said. Harith and his brother Pramod even had trouble registering the name of their company, CMOaxis. ""We called the company CMOaxis, which stands for Chief Marketing Officer, but for a long time couldn't get the name approved by the registrar of companies here, because they said CMO means Chief Minister's Office. So we had a really tough time, just convincing people."" But for the 36-year-old Vinod seeing the bigger picture and potential of his company was worth of all the aggravation. An October 2007 report into the marketing sector by First Research put its value at around $8 billion. A year on, the potential value might still be there, but tapping in to it during an economic downturn as investors and companies return to ""studying the market"" will be the big challenge. ""Despite so many global funds being in India it's still very difficult for a start-up to get funding."" It certainly is for first time entrepreneurs, as Harith suggests that those with a family history in business or politics where it's easier to secure backing find things much easier. ""In PR first generation entrepreneur successes are still there but you can count them on the fingers of one hand. ""The understanding just isn't there in a part of India that is more used to the garment industry and traditional forms of business,"" says Pramod Harith, Vinod's brother and business partner. Different industries, same problems . 700 miles (1,127 kilometers) away in Pune, Jesh Krishna Murthy is busy with his fledgling animation company Anibrain. After 13 years working abroad he returned to India to find the same frustrations as the Hariths in setting up the business. ""If you are going to do business in India, there is a lot of red tape and corruption. You have to learn to deal with, but it is very frustrating. If you're caught up in some regulation and the laws are kind of ambiguous and there's no right or wrong the authorities can give you a lot of trouble,"" he said. If you can't deal with it, then you're doing business in the wrong country. It is stupid, but part and parcel of being in India."" Krishna Murthy brought much of Anibrain's business contacts with him, doing post-production graphics on films such as ""Lust Caution"" John Woo's ""Red Cliff"" and big budget Hollywood flicks, much of the hard work comes in maintaining quality. ""Getting the job is the easier part; it's delivering it to the quality that's expected and with the service levels that expected that the harder part. We work on that day in and day out,"" he said. Having worked abroad he has an acute understanding of the differences between various work cultures and attitudes and the thought of working for a graphics company in India was almost unthinkable. ""There was no lack of talent in terms of the animators, but the way in which the animation studios were managed was lacking. ""I found it disheartening that the people who were managing these companies only cared about the hardware and how much money was pumped into the software, forgetting that it's about people. I would have gone crazy working for people like that, especially having worked abroad,"" he said . At Anibrain employees have a five-day week and something closer to a 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. working day, compared to the more typical Indian routine of working 6 days a week, starting at 1pm and working until around midnight. With a more western work culture at Anibrain, Krishna Murthy's company is still in the minority, although Pune has become something of a creative design hub attracting similar companies with like-minded attitudes, thanks to it's proximity to Mumbai, but better quality of life, and the high quality of its universities and training colleges. Changing attitudes . Facing rigid attitudes from clients has been a challenge for both Krishna Murthy and the Hariths, but there is the potentially bigger task of changing attitudes closer to home. ""The mindset has changed in South India, thanks to the growth in the IT sector here and rise in entrepreneurs. Until this happened, doing business was not thought of as a very hot thing to do -- in traditional families in South India, if you're doing business then there's something wrong with you,"" said Harith. Vinod and Pramod were both born and raised in Chennai and the desire to blaze their own trail and be part of the positive changes to business and society in their hometown was one of their motivating forces. For Krishna Murthy the pains, pitfall but pleasures of setting up shop in India are all worth the effort: . ""For me it was challenge. I wanted to be in India and to do the kind of high end film graphics that you would have thought couldn't be done in India with Indian talent that hadn't been as trained. To do it you have to be a bit of a sadist, but that's part of the charm of India.""","Entrepreneurs and start-ups still face maddening tangle of bureaucracy .

"(CNN) -- Women in Somalia's third-largest city, Baidoa, have been ordered to wear Islamic dress starting this week or face jail time, according to a resident and Somali media reports. Somali women wait to get medicine at a clinic near Mogadishu in July. The order -- issued last week by Al-Shabaab, the radical Islamist militia that controls the city -- also warns business owners to close their shops during daily prayers, or they will be temporarily shut down, a local journalist said. The militia has ordered women to cover their bodies and heads from view, according to a resident of Baidoa who did not want to be identified for security reasons. The clothing must be black, red or white, and women in the impoverished city are concerned that they will not be able to purchase clothing that conforms to the order, the resident said. He said women would be jailed if they violated the order after it goes into effect Tuesday. Somalia's Shabelle Media, quoting an Al-Shabaab spokesman, said they would spend 12 hours in jail. Shabelle points out that it is unclear how Al-Shabaab will enforce its order in Baidoa. The militia has issued similar edicts that failed to be carried out, according to Shabelle. But this edict could be bolstered by Somalia's parliament, which voted unanimously Saturday to allow sharia, or Islamic law, in the Horn of Africa country. Lawmakers hope to boost President Sharif Ahmed's efforts to defeat Al-Shabaab, which has vowed to fight the government until sharia is imposed in Somalia. Somali Prime Minister Omar Abdirashid Ali Sharmarke told Voice of America that parliament's vote ""removed any justifications for any opposition group ... to use Islam for political ends."" There are concerns that Islamic law, which has numerous interpretations and variations, could lead to government-sanctioned human rights abuses in Somalia. The strict interpretation of sharia forbids girls from attending school, requires veils for women and beards for men, and bans music and television. Last week, Al-Shabaab fighters patrolling the streets shot and killed a 20-year-old Somali man because he was not praying at the designated time, according to a local journalist who cannot be named for security reasons. Sharmarke denied that the vote would open the door for a radical interpretation of Islamic law, such as that carried out by the Taliban in Afghanistan. ""People always think of the Taliban and Talibanization of a country. But that isn't the case,"" the prime minister said. ""I think sharia in Somalia is part of the laws for thousands of years, and we never had this kind of a thing. Besides, it doesn't have to be that way, cutting hands."" Under some strict interpretations of sharia, a thief is punished by having a hand cut off. Al-Shabaab was once the armed wing of the Islamic Courts Union, which took over most of southern Somalia in the second half of 2006. The United States says the group is affiliated with the al Qaeda terrorist network, and it backed an Ethiopian invasion that drove the ICU from power in 2006.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Michael Jackson's father suspects his son was murdered and that Dr. Conrad Murray is ""just a fall guy"" in a conspiracy. Joe Jackson appeared on CNN's ""Larry King Live"" on Monday night, just hours after sitting in a courtroom to hear Murray plead not guilty to a single charge of involuntary manslaughter in his son's death last summer. A Los Angeles judge set bail at $75,000, despite arguments from the prosecutor that Murray is a flight risk and needs a higher bail. Murray posted the bond and was released several hours later. Michael Jackson's family, including his parents, four of his brothers and one sister, filled the first two rows of the small courtroom. ""I was looking for justice, and justice, to me, would be a murder charge,"" Joe Jackson told King. Prosecutors charged Murray, who was Jackson's personal physician, with causing the pop star's death ""without malice"" by acting ""without due caution and circumspection."" Murray was with the pop star when he died on June 25, 2009. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson's death a homicide, resulting from a combination of drugs, primarily propofol -- a powerful anesthesia -- and lorazepam. Joe Jackson suggested it was more than a doctor making a fatal judgment. ""To me, he's just a fall guy,"" Jackson said. ""There's other people, I think, involved with this whole thing. But I think that he's interrogated -- he would come clean and tell everything he knows."" He said Michael Jackson told his mother, as he was preparing for his comeback concerts in London, England, last year, that he thought he would be killed. ""He was afraid to even do all of these shows, because he was afraid that he wouldn't get a chance to finish all of the show,"" Joe Jackson said. ""He couldn't do all those shows back-to-back. Even his kids say that he had told them that he would be murdered."" Murray turned himself in shortly before 4 p.m. at a branch courthouse near Los Angeles International Airport. He pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing before Judge Keith L. Schwartz. The judge refused to suspend Murray's medical license as a term of his bond, but he did order him not to use any anesthesia on patients. ""I don't want you sedating people,"" Schwartz told Murray. Read the criminal complaint . The involuntary manslaughter charge means that Murray caused Jackson's death by acting ""without due caution and circumspection."" If convicted, Murray would face a maximum four-year prison sentence, according to prosecutors. More on involuntary manslaughter . Jackson family members later reacted to what they saw in the courtroom: . ""Not enough,"" Jermaine Jackson said when asked what he thought of the charge. ""I don't like what happened,"" Joe Jackson said as he left the courthouse. La Toya Jackson later issued a statement through a publicist. ""Michael was murdered and although he died at the hands of Dr. Conrad Murray, I believe Dr. Murray was a part of a much larger plan,"" her statement said. ""There are other individuals involved and I will not rest and I will continue to fight until all of the proper individuals are brought forth and justice is served."" Her statement did not elaborate on what she meant in her reference to ""a much larger plan."" Murray traveled to Los Angeles at the end of January from his home in Houston, Texas, in expectation of possible charges, his lawyer said. He used part of his time last week to visit the pop star's resting place in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Murray, a cardiologist, was hired as Jackson's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for comeback concerts in London, England. The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson at his $100,000-a-month rented Holmby Hills mansion through the early morning hours of June 25, 2009, in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep, according to a police affidavit. He administered sleep aids, and after Jackson finally began sleeping in the late morning hours, Murray said, he left the bedroom for ""about two minutes maximum,"" the affidavit says. ""Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing,"" it says. The doctor stayed with Jackson as an ambulance rushed him to UCLA Medical Center. Efforts at CPR proved fruitless, and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson's death a homicide, resulting from a combination of drugs, primarily propofol and lorazepam. The coroner's statement said Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" but there were ""other conditions contributing to death: benzodiazepine effect."" Lorazepam and two other drugs Murray said he used are benzodiazepines. The doctor told investigators he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing, a police affidavit said. Murray had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks at the time of the singer's death. The doctor told investigators he gave Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol, the generic name for Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip. The doctor told police he was worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and tried to wean him off it. During the two nights before Jackson's death, Murray said, he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep. The full autopsy report, which was released Monday afternoon, included an analysis by an anesthesiology consultant of the use of propofol. The consultant, Dr. Selma Calmes, concluded that the ""standard of care for administering propofol was not met."" ""There was no evidence of an infusion pump for control of an IV infusion. No monitors were found at the scene; a blood pressure cuff and portable pulse oximeter were recovered from a closet in the next room,"" Calmes wrote. An oxygen tank was found near where Jackson slept, but it was empty when the coroner investigator checked it two weeks after Jackson died, Calmes said. ""Multiple opened bottles of propofol were found with small amounts of remaining drugs,"" Calmes said. ""A used bottle should be discarded six hours after opening, to avoid possible bacterial growth."" ""The level of propofol found on toxicology exam are similar to those found during general anesthesia for major surgery,"" Calmes said. During such surgery, any patient would be ""intubated and ventilated by an anesthesiologist,"" she said. The consultant's report said that the level of lorazepam found in Jackson ""would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol.""

"(The Frisky) -- Groucho Marx once famously quipped ""I don't care to belong to a club that would have me as a member."" I sort of feel the same way about online dating sites. There has got to be a better way to meet people. Sadly, mental telepathy does not work. Unless you know what I was just thinking, in which case, e-mail me. We flock to digital artifices that both feed and coddle our egos, says writer of online dating sites. I've recently begun... researching popular dating sites. Not because I need a date. No! I don't need a date. I'm up to my ears in hot lady action. No, this research is for you, for all of you. It's a testament to my generosity of spirit I waded through these interweb love sewers in order to impart some sort of wisdom. Here's the wisdom: dating sites are terrible. Possibly, if I was in prison, an Alaskan crab fisherman or a morbidly obese shut-in so humongous I had to wash myself with a ShamWow stapled to a broom handle, I could see the value in such sites. But I'm not isolated, nor confined to a forklift. I don't need a middleman brokering a get together between the potential woman of my dreams and my own abilities to self-sabotage and humiliate myself. I can do this without an intermediary. The Frisky: Have to go online to get a date? This might or might not be a totally uninformed opinion. The extent of my research began and ended with me signing up for OK Cupid, and failing to finish my profile. I couldn't even bring myself to pick a pseudonym, which just seemed like the first of many lies required to meet anyone. Do I call myself OptimusGandalf and admit from the get-go that I'm an alpha nerd? Do I overshare a little too much and pick EdgarAllanEeyore? Or do I just admit to being a snarky, pretentious creep and go for HumbertHumbert? The Frisky: Online dating dos and don'ts . I tried to fill out the profile, but instead, it just filled me with a quiet rage. The self-summary section was baffling. It pushed me into an existential identity crisis. Who am I? Or more importantly, who am I when it comes to who I want someone else to think I am, so they will contact me, go out with me, and eventually kiss me? Am I a sensitive guy, or a romantic, or sarcastic? Maybe I'm all three. I love long walks, going to see live indie bands, and whatever. I made sure to pepper everything with winking non-sequiturs and casual attempts at pop profundity. Then there was the section where I define myself by the books, movies, and music I listen to. My music list was a near impenetrable list of overly eclectic bands that reflect my excellent taste, punctuated by ""and Genesis."" My movies were all '80s flicks, foreign films, and David Lynch. By the time I got to books, and wrote ""Pynchon,"" I was in a full-fledged state of self-loathing. The Frisky: Five online dating types to avoid . Let me get this straight: I'm going to spend a ton of time crafting a persona that is a borderline dishonest amplification of the personality traits I think other people will find attractive so I can find someone who's done the same thing, and we can both go out and discover that we're equally compatible idiots fakers. It's like a masquerade party in the Twilight Zone: I take off my Brad Pitt mask just so I can reveal Sloth from ""The Goonies."" The Frisky: Downside of online dating . There are, no doubt, many of you who have met the love of your life via online dating sites. Good for you. Congratulations on basically winning the lottery. I firmly believe I have a better chance of getting a girlfriend dressed like Zeus, stopping women on the street, and bellowing, ""Rut with me, mortal beauty, and feel thine mighty, fleshy thunder!"" Not that I want a girlfriend. I just broke up with six the other day. I can deal with the risks of love. The threat of heartbreak is what makes finding that one person who sparks your fuse so precious. But I have to be honest, the online dating thing freaked me out. It touched a nerve, and I'm flummoxed as to why. The only conclusion I could come up with was that, maybe, we deserved them. Perhaps online dating sites accurately reflect a generation of singles so entitled to instant happiness and acceptance, we flock to digital artifices that both feed and coddle our egos. Virtual environments where we can indiscriminately reject dishonest projections of identity, while simultaneously being insulated from the very rejection we dole out. A play land of false romantic promises and deferred risk. A huge solipsistic waste of time.

"Johannesburg, South Africa (CNN) -- Exiled Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide has announced that he is ready to return home to help rebuild his earthquake-shattered country. The former president has been living in South Africa since fleeing Haiti during a violent uprising in 2004. Aristide told reporters gathered at a hotel near Johannesburg's international airport that he is ready to return from exile as soon as today. ""To symbolize our readiness we have decided to meet not just anywhere but here in the shadow of the Oliver Tambo International airport,"" he said. ""As far as we are concerned we are ready to leave today, tomorrow, at any time to join the people of Haiti, to share in their suffering, help rebuild the country moving from misery to poverty with dignity."" Get the latest developments in Haiti . A massive international rescue operation is under way to treat the thousands of survivors trapped and injured by a 7.0 magnitude earthquake that shook the country on Tuesday. Aristide said he and his wife were planning to fly to Haiti with friends who were ferrying emergency medical supplies to the country. Impact Your World . It is not clear whether Aristide has sought formal permission from the Haitian government to return. He refused to answer questions from the media. Analysts say Aristide's arrival back in the country after six years could aggravate an already tense political situation. ""If he goes back to Haiti it will be a massive blow to the fragile political stability at the moment,"" said Irenea Renuncio-Mateos, Latin American and Caribbean country analyst for IHS Global Insight. Aid groups: Catastrophic situation looms . Aristide is a controversial figure in Haiti. A former priest, his left-wing views appealed to the poorest of the poor, many of whom have called for his return in recent years amid increasing discontent with the current government. Once coalition partners, the political divide between Aristide and President Rene Preval has widened. Aristide's party Fanmi Lavalas is one of 15 that have been banned from contesting legislative elections to be held in February. Irenea Renuncio-Mateos said it remains to be seen whether Haitians welcome Aristide's return as their ""savior,"" or whether they turn to the United States and the international community to pull the country from turmoil. ""An important factor is that the U.N.-led mission in Haiti has been encountering problems on the ground in the past because people have been hostile to foreign presence on the ground,"" she said. ""If Aristide makes it to Haiti, what is going to be the impact? Is it going to cause protests?"" The former leader has a long and tumultuous relationship with Haiti, one of the world's poorest countries. He became its first freely elected president in December 1990 before being ejected from office just one year later in a military coup. He was returned to power in 1994 after a peace agreement brokered by then-President Bill Clinton, backed by U.S. troops to restore order. After another change of leadership in 1995, Aristide took office again in November 2000 in a vote blighted by an opposition boycott and claims of fraud. The deep unrest led to looting and violence that eventually forced Aristide into exile in 2004. During his presidency, Aristide lost the support of the United States and angered France with his calls for reparations for huge sums of money paid to the country for its independence. President Rene Preval came to power for the second time in February 2006. He has the backing of the U.S. government. During a 30-minute phone call on Friday, President Obama ""pledged the full support of the American people for the government and people of Haiti."" President Preval in turn expressed his appreciation for the U.S. response to the earthquake. It is more than likely that the return of a political foe with the power to divide the country will not be similarly received. CNN's Nkepile Mabuse contributed to this report.","Aristide tells reporters gathered in Johannesburg that he's ready to return to Haiti .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Chinese workers and army soldiers were racing to sweep snow-covered highways and unclog railway routes for millions of travelers trapped by cold weather. Souzhou, China, is blanketed by the most snow the city has had in 25 years, according to I-Reporter Susan Arthur. More than 67 million people have been affected by the weather and economic losses are expected to reach as much as $3 billion, Chinese officials say. Blizzards have snapped power lines and destroyed houses and farmland, prompting fears of food and energy shortages. Twenty-four people have died and some 827,000 people have been evacuated in 14 different provinces, the Ministry of Civil Affairs said Monday. In the past week, the snowstorms have hit the provinces in central, eastern and southern China -- places that are used to mild winters, not extreme wintry blasts. ""We've never seen such a cold weather lasting for such long a time,"" said Tang Shan, a man in his 70s in Changsha, the capital of Hunan province. ""The last time we had one here was over 50 years ago, and not this bad."" The snow and sleet have paralyzed roads, railways and airports, leaving tens of millions of travelers marooned, officials say. Many of them are bound for home ahead of the traditional Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival, which falls on February 7.  Watch how the snowstorms have resulted in transit chaos » . For several days before and after that day, an estimated 178 million Chinese will travel by train, and 22 million more by plane, officials say. Millions more will take long-haul vans and buses. The Lunar New Year travel is China's busiest travel period of the year. But the cold snap is hampering travel plans. Railway and highway routes have been brought to a standstill, several regional airports have been closed and many provinces have imposed power ""brownouts"" to conserve energy. On Hunan's major highways, more than 60,000 bus riders were stranded because of icy roads. In the southern city of Guangzhou, as many as 500,000 train passengers were stranded the past few days when a power failure in neighboring Hunan province crippled the regular train services, local officials said. About 100,000 passengers  packed the square in front of the train station while others found shelter in schools and other public buildings while waiting for their trains.  Watch travelers packed shoulder to shoulder » . Even the local stock market seems affected by the nasty weather. The Shanghai composite index dropped by more than 7 percent on Monday, dragged in part by investors' concerns over the damage caused by the foul winter weather. Worst hit were transport and power stocks. Chinese premier Wen Jiabao has ordered urgent measures to unclog the transport jam and ensure a steady supply of food and energy. ""Let us mobilize urgently and work as one to wage this tough battle against the disaster,"" he said in an emergency meeting. ""Let's ensure that the people enjoy a joyful and auspicious Spring Festival."" But more miserable weather is expected. China's weather bureau Monday issued a rare ""red alert,"" warning of more severe snowstorms in the coming days. If so, the number of stranded travelers will surely swell. Tang Shan, the retired official in Hunan, is staying put instead of joining the holiday exodus. Even so, he finds the frigid weather a big nuisance. ""Hospitals now treat children who caught colds and old people who sprained bones after slipping and falling,"" he says. ""Even just walking in the icy street is perilous.""

"(CNN) -- Frozen winter conditions are helping slow the spread of a pipeline leak on Alaska's North Slope, an environmental official said. An estimated 46,000 gallons of a water-and-oil mixture was spilled before the source of the leak -- a pipe rupture -- was identified Monday, according to the Alaska Department of Environmental Conservation (ADEC). The ruptured 18-inch line, owned by oil company BP and which usually carries a mixture of 75 percent water and 25 percent oil, has been repaired. The frozen conditions make the spill less mobile, Matthew Carr of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said late Wednesday. ""Any spill is regrettable,"" Steve Reinhart, a BP spokesman in Anchorage, told CNN. ""We will clean this up thoroughly and our investigation will find out what happened so that we can ensure this doesn't happen again."" Reinhart said the spill, which occurred entirely on land, has had no impact on production or wildlife in the area, and is contained to a small fraction of the much larger Prudhoe Bay oil field. ""It is not a pool of oil spreading out across the ground,"" Reinhart said, comparing its consistency to that of a snow cone. ""It's a partially solidified mass that's piled up in one area, and as we speak, truckloads of this material is being moved off this site and to a collection depot."" According to officials, the rupture was approximately 24 inches lengthwise, running along the bottom of the pipeline. In an incident report on its Web site Wednesday, ADEC described the rupture as being ""consistent with an overpressure scenario,"" caused by ice inside the pipe. The leak was discovered early November 29 by a BP worker conducting a routine inspection. The North Slope's biggest spill to date happened in 2006 when a corroded pipeline dumped 200,000 gallons of crude oil. CNN's Nick Valencia contributed to this report.","Ice buildup led to Alaskan pipeline rupture, officials say .

"Editor's note: Ronald F. Ferguson is Senior Lecturer in Education and Public Policy at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the Harvard Kennedy School. His most recent book is ""Toward Excellence with Equity: An emerging vision for closing the achievement gap,"" published by Harvard Education Press. He is the creator of the Tripod Project for School Improvement and also the faculty co-chair and director of the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University. Ronald Ferguson says parents can play a key role in improving their children's education. CAMBRIDGE, Massachusetts (CNN) -- Raising the quality of teaching and learning in American schools is a priority. It receives a great deal of attention in our national discourse and should receive more. Test scores and graduation rates are improving faster in other nations than in the United States and this threatens our quality of life in a competitive world. In addition, achievement gaps between racial groups in the United States remain large. The social and political vitality of the nation may depend on closing these racial gaps. Blacks and Hispanics are doing better than in the past compared to whites, but still not nearly good enough. Making schools better should be only one part of our national strategy. Life at home has been a relatively neglected topic and needs to come out of the shadows. Especially in churches, neighborhood organizations, families and informal social networks, helping parents do their best needs to be as big a priority as achieving excellent schools. This goes beyond public policies. I am talking about changes in mindsets and lifestyles in a national social and cultural movement to close achievement gaps between groups -- a movement to achieve excellence with equity. More reading at home is a place to start. I present data in my recent book based on a large sample of students in elementary and secondary schools from several states. Black and Hispanic students reported less leisure reading at home compared to whites, watched television more, were much more likely to have televisions in their bedrooms and (perhaps as a consequence) were more prone to become sleepy at school. Also, blacks and Hispanics, including those with college-educated parents, reported fewer books in their homes than whites whose parents had fewer years of schooling. However, life at home helps shape academic outcomes long before children begin reading books. Family-level supports in the first two years of life help predict achievement years later, in elementary school. Beginning soon after birth, the most supportive mothers teach the joy of living and learning, through lots of active, encouraging, verbal and nonverbal communication. They engage actively in helping children learn to walk and talk and to explore their new world and manipulate their toys and other objects. Such mothers exist in large numbers in every racial group. Nonetheless, in a recent study by Harvard's Richard Murnane and co-authors, differences in mother-child interaction patterns like these were found to account for one-third of the black-white gap in math and English skills at the beginning of kindergarten -- and one-quarter at the end of third grade. As children get older, highly responsive parents spend time with children, look for ways to be helpful and encourage them to voice their opinions. They are good listeners and they teach their children that they have a right to be heard and that people in positions of authority can sometimes be persuaded. The same parents can also be demanding, providing rules and structure and holding children consistently accountable for their behavior. Professor Jelani Mandara of Northwestern University found in a nationally representative sample that students who achieved the highest test scores among blacks, Hispanics and whites had parents who were both responsive and demanding. According to the study, white parents were much more likely to be both responsive and demanding than black and Hispanic parents; whereas black parents, in particular, were often highly demanding, but tended not to be as responsive in the ways the study measured. Among early adolescents, differences along these dimensions helped account for the higher test scores of whites as compared with blacks and Hispanics. Findings like the above should be part of the conversation among black and Hispanic community leaders as they respond to the fact that even the children of college-educated parents often achieve at lower-than-expected levels. It is true that children of every racial group do better, on average, when their parents have more education. For example, black 12th graders whose parents completed college have higher average test scores than black 12th graders whose parents only completed high school. However, it is also true, according to the National Assessment of Educational Progress, that test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites with highly educated parents -- parents with 16 or more years of schooling -- are greater than test score gaps between 12th-grade blacks and whites whose parents have less education. These are unpleasant facts, but we cannot improve what we fear and refuse to confront. Yes, we should respectfully acknowledge and rectify injustices that have impeded the efforts of many non-white parents and we should also work relentlessly to provide high quality schooling opportunities for children from every background. But especially in our own homes and communities, there is another responsibility. It is to give parents of every racial and social-class background the examples, encouragement and supports they need to help their children experience the joy of learning and develop ambitious attitudes and habits of mind that will serve them well throughout their lives. As one effort to accept this responsibility, the Achievement Gap Initiative at Harvard University has begun convening the AGI Parent Leadership Network. Beginning in September 2008, researchers and parent leaders from communities in several states have met every four months at Harvard to learn about relevant research, trade ideas, coach one another, and share examples of their own leadership. Presentations and discussions have covered topics ranging from home-learning lifestyles to ways of helping schools and holding them accountable. The main purpose is to equip parent leaders with ideas and energy for helping others in home communities to help ALL our children succeed. In the Civil Rights Movement, legions of people worked in a multitude of ways for racial justice. That work continues. However, the time has come for a movement focused on realizing our full human potential as learners. We need a movement for excellence with equity -- to prepare all our children for the social, ethical and intellectual challenges of a 21st century world.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- It was Anabella De León's frail 86-year-old mother who answered the door when the men came knocking. ""They told her, 'say to Anabella that we are going to kill her very soon,'"" De León told CNN. The visit left her mother crying, anxious and shocked. Congresswoman Anabella de Leon with her husband in London for a performance of ""Seven"" by Vital Voices. That was four months ago. No attempt on her life has been made, De León said, but she still looks over her shoulder, takes alternative routes in her car, constantly checking that she's not being followed. Anabella De León is not well known outside Guatemala. Within the Central American country though, she has made headlines as an outspoken critic of corruption. She's serving her fourth term in Congress as a member of the Patriotic Party, which last weekend elected her to one of its top posts of Third National Secretary. The death threats are not new. Since 2002, she's been protected by at least one security guard on request from the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. Her 26-year-old son is also shadowed by a security guard; a precautionary move in response to earlier threats connected to De León's anti-corruption efforts. ""The fight against corruption doesn't give you friends,"" she said.  ""[It] gives you enemies, important and dangerous enemies,"" she told CNN during a recent trip to London for a performance of the play ""Seven,"" which profiles De León and six other international female leaders. Read more about ""Seven."" After 22 years of speaking out against corruption, first as a lawyer and then as a congresswoman, De León says she remains fearful given the legacy of violence and instability in Guatemala. De León noted that the country had recently been shaken by one killing in particular. On May 10, a high-profile lawyer was shot dead while cycling in Guatemala City. Rodrigo Rosenberg's killing might not have made headlines had he not recorded a video message just four days earlier. ""If you are watching this message,"" Rosenberg said on the video, ""it is because I was assassinated by President Álvaro Colom, with help from Gustavo Alejos,"" his private secretary. In the video, the lawyer predicted he would be targeted for speaking out about the killings of his client, a prominent businessman and his daughter. Rosenberg claimed they were killed because they had refused to participate in acts of corruption. President Colom has vehemently denied the claims. ""We categorically reject the accusations that pretend to tie the president, first lady and private secretary as those responsible for this assassination,"" Colom said in a national address in May. Colom's Foreign Minister blamed Rosenberg's death on members of organized crime who he says are seeking to destabilize the country. The case sparked street protests both for and against the president. The government has promised a full and fair investigation into the killing and has received the support of the Organization of American States (OAS). The inquiry is being led by the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG), a United Nations-backed body established in 2007 to battle corruption in the country. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) is assisting. De León sees the killing and the political scandal as a reminder of the enormity of the problems plaguing Guatemala. The country has been struggling to recover from a bloody 36-year civil war which ended in 1996. According to the United Nations, Guatemala has one of the highest murder rates in the world, with many killed by street gangs or in robberies. Almost 2,000 violent deaths were recorded in the first four months of this year and the Office of Human Rights warns 2009 is on track to become the most violent year in the country's recent history. Offenders know there's little chance of being caught. The U.N. says only two percent of crimes are ever solved. Meanwhile, the gap between rich and poor is more like a chasm and social services are suffering as a result of one of the lowest rates of tax collection in the world. President Álvaro Colom and his party, the National Union of Hope, came to power last year with a promise to crack down on corruption, crime, poverty and impunity. Kevin Casas-Zamora, senior fellow in Foreign Policy and the Latin American Initiative at the Brookings Institution told CNN similar promises have been made by previous governments, but they have tried and failed to bring change. ""Business interests are very cohesive and very powerful in Guatemala, then you have organized crime which is a new and powerful actor,"" said Casas-Zamora, who recently served as Vice President of Costa Rica. ""Those actors have no intention whatsoever of letting the State become effective in fighting against corruption and organized crime. It's been proven time after time that [the government] has been blocked,"" Casas-Zamora said. De León says regardless of the political outcome of the murder allegations, the scandal may have prompted a subtle and potentially powerful change among Guatemala's population. She believes recent street protests demanding justice for Rodrigo Rosenberg's death are a sign that people are ready for change. ""People in Guatemala are tired, tired of injustice, tired of corruption, tired of abuses, of violations,"" she said. ""Guatemala needs to change. But for change, you need not one voice, not two voices, not 20 voices. Fifty-thousand people in the last demonstration are proof that everybody's tired.""","Congresswoman Anabella De León tells CNN of her fight against corruption .

"(CNN) -- Freezing temperatures plagued much of the nation Thursday after a major storm moved into Canada, but another storm that will dump more snow in the Sierra Nevada was brewing, forecasters said. That storm, which is expected to start overnight, should last several days and eventually make its way eastward, like its predecessor, CNN meteorologist Chad Myers said. The Sierras, straddling California and Nevada, received more than 3 feet of snow in the last few days. Crews in El Dorado County, California, have been working around the clock this week to restore power to residents who have been left in the dark and cold since Sunday, according to CNN affiliate KXTV. That county, near Lake Tahoe, has received more than 30 inches of snow. Elsewhere, more than 18 inches of snow had accumulated in parts of the Midwest by Thursday, and high winds made the snow difficult to clear. Unusually low temperatures were in store for much of the nation into Friday, the National Weather Service said. ""Almost the entire Lower 48 is below normal as far as temperatures. In some cases, 20, 30 degrees,"" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. Freezing or below-freezing temperatures were recorded from Dallas, Texas, and Memphis, Tennessee, to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and Chicago, Illinois. The temperature in Detroit, Michigan, was 16; in Minneapolis it was minus 5; and in Chicago it was 1 degree. Overnight temperatures were to dip to 17 in Denver, Colorado, and Kansas City, Missouri; 24 in Seattle, Washington; 31 in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma; 32 in Las Vegas, Nevada; and 27 in Atlanta, Georgia. Lake-effect snow warnings and advisories were in effect for western Michigan and the state's Upper Peninsula, areas that border Lake Michigan, according to the National Weather Service. Lake-effect snow forms when a mass of cold air moves over a body of warmer water. iReport: Share your photos, video . Tens of thousands of people were left in the dark in southeast Michigan, with temperatures that plunged well below freezing, after high winds blew down power lines, according to CNN affiliate WXYZ TV. Schools and government offices were closed in many cities. In Green Bay, Wisconsin, Jeanne Knurr took advantage of having her two children -- Sierra, 12, and Austin, 15 -- home. ""We told them we were going to put them to work,"" she told CNN affiliate WLUK on Wednesday. ""We told them before they went to bed that they were going to have to help mom shovel because she's going to be all alone."" They didn't seem to mind. ""Well, I think shoveling snow's actually better because afterward you actually get to make forts and stuff,"" Sierra said. ""Sleeping in is a lot better."" iReport: Thousands join campus snowball fight . High winds made snow removal difficult. Wind gusts reached 50 mph in Omaha, Nebraska; 58 mph in Fort Wayne, Indiana; and 60 mph in Toledo, Ohio. In Omaha, as soon as plows cleared the snow, the wind blew more in their paths, noted former resident and CNN meteorologist Chad Myers as he watched a video clip. Several states reported storm-related deaths. In Northumberland, New York, authorities said a freight train struck a snowplow Wednesday, killing a passenger in the plow, reported CNN affiliate WTEN. In Yale, Iowa, an elderly man was discovered dead Wednesday outside his truck, said Bret Voorhees, spokesman for the state's Homeland Security and Emergency Management Agency. A 28-year-old woman was killed in Omaha on Tuesday night when a truck plowing snow in a parking lot backed into her, police spokesman Jacob Bettin said. She was pronounced dead at the scene. In northern Arizona, dozens of elk hunters were stranded this week by deep snow in the area's backwoods. The Coconino County Sheriff's Office said it has assisted or offered assistance to about 50 hunters Wednesday and Thursday, including some air evacuations. The Arizona Game and Fish Department also has been providing flyovers by helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft as rescue crews search for hunting parties and campsites, the sheriff's office said. Brady Smith, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service, said hunters were warned of the possibility of getting snowed in earlier in the week. The city of Flagstaff, the county seat, received at least 30 inches of snow. The elk hunt ends Thursday. CNN's Chuck Conder contributed to this report.","Major storm moves into Canada, but another one brewing over Sierra Nevada .

"Mecca, Saudi Arabia (CNN) -- Chanting ""Allahu Akbar"" -- God is Greater than any -- more than 2 million pilgrims crossed new pedestrian bridges Saturday to perform one of the last rituals of the Hajj season. Jamarat is a re-enactment of an event when Prophet Abraham stoned the devil and rejected his temptations, according to Muslim traditions. The ritual stoning of three pillars, which occurs in the tent city of Mina -- about two miles from Mecca, was the scene of stampedes and many deaths in the 1980s and 1990s as pilgrims passed a crowded bottleneck area leading to the small pillars on the ground. But this year the Saudi government completed a new project that avoids past congestion at the site. The government has erected three massive pillars and completed a $1.2 billion, five-story bridge nearby where pilgrims can toss stones. Authorities and pilgrims say it's a roomier atmosphere and more efficient way to accommodate the faithful. ""Everything went fine so far,"" Col. Khakled Qarar Mohammadi, head of the emergency forces at Jamarat, told CNN. ""It is an immense responsibility that we had to deal with. About 3 million pilgrims move in a small geographic area at the same time wanting to do the same ritual. So we have been preparing for this for years now."" Irtiza Hasan, a pilgrim from the United States, said all went well at the ceremony. ""The only incident I saw was that there were some handicapped women who were turned away in fears that they get hurt."" But Mohammadi said, ""There are 10 vans on the second floor especially designated to serve the elderly and handicapped. Each van can take up to 14 pilgrims."" As a measure to alleviate harm, according to Muslim traditions, the elderly and the handicapped can appoint someone else to stone for them. The five-story Jamarat bridge is air-conditioned at 19 degrees Centigrade, or 66 Fahrenheit, throughout the day and backed by water sprinklers that can reduce the temperature to about 29 degrees C, or 84 F. The bridge is designed to allow the addition of seven more levels to hold as many as 5 million pilgrims in the future if the need arises. According to authorities, the bridge is 950 meters (1,039 yards) long and 80 meters (87 yards) wide. Each floor is 12 meters (13 yards) high with three tunnels and 12 entrances and 12 exits in six directions. It has a helicopter pad for emergencies. According to Mohammadi, the project has 509 advanced closed-circuit television cameras monitoring pilgrims' movements. Those cameras feed into the main operations room, which oversees the Jamarat Bridge and the surrounding areas -- all screened by dozens of security officers on 72 monitors at the operation room. The stoning ritual is done over at least two days, where pilgrims stone three pillars at Mina -- believed to be where the Prophet Abraham stoned the devil when he tried to dissuade him from obeying God's orders to slaughter his son. According to tradition, the event was a test from God, who gave Abraham a ram to slaughter instead. The last ritual that marks the end of Hajj is when pilgrims go from Mina to Mecca to make a last visit to al-Masjid al-Haram, Islam's holiest site, before going back home. The ritual is called Tawaf al-Wada'a -- or farewell circumambulation in the holy mosque. It's where pilgrims go around the black cube seven times counter-clockwise asking that their Lord accept their pilgrimage and grant them another visit to the holy city.","Goverment constructed three new massive pillars, five-story bridge for Hajj ritual .

"(CNN) -- When you finish one video game in a series and begin the next, you're basically forced to start from scratch without carrying over any of your accomplishments from the previous game. But the popular ""Mass Effect"" sci-fi action trilogy aims to change that -- by allowing players to complete one game and transfer their character to the next one in the series. It is an ambitious project that involves nearly 35,000 lines of dialogue. ""We wanted to create the biggest story we could tell,"" said Casey Hudson, BioWare's project director for ""Mass Effect 2"" and executive producer of the ""Mass Effect"" franchise. The just-released ""Mass Effect 2"" picks up the story as the lead character, named Shepard, has been brought back to life after a devastating attack by an invading race of machines bent on eliminating organic life. The action takes place shortly after the events of the first ""Mass Effect,"" which was set in the year 2183 in the Milky Way galaxy. In a rare twist, players who played the first ""Mass Effect"" game are being given the opportunity to import their characters into the new game along with all their rewards, romances and consequences. Hudson said his team tried to create a fictional universe that players could explore over long periods of time to ""have an epic experience."" By carrying over the data from the original ""Mass Effect,"" Hudson's team tried to show the consequences of characters' choices. But by accounting for so many variables in the first games, Bioware was faced with a daunting task going forward. ""We used tech skills we developed going back to 'Baldur's Gate' [in 1998],"" Hudson explained. ""Writing for 'ME2' was the hardest thing we've ever done."" ""Mass Effect 2"" has 15 to 20 percent more dialogue and 30 percent more key decisions -- choices that affect the game's outcome -- than the first game, said Hudson, who believes the voice acting in the new game is more movie-like than the first one. ""It took several months of voice work, and often we would bring back an actor to get the right inflections for the character and the scene,"" he said. ""There are hundreds of characters in the game that needed voices."" Although ""Mass Effect 2"" is being billed as a dark second chapter in the trilogy, there are laugh-out-loud moments of dialogue. Playing the game reveals that even its tense moments are given a softer edge with unexpected comic exchanges between characters. For example, in one scene, Shepard tries to persuade a character not to follow orders that could lead to a ""suicide mission."" Without missing a beat, Shepard's squad mates look at each other as one says, ""We can ignore suicidal orders? Why wasn't I told about that?"" ""Mass Effect 2"" also offers players the opportunity to interrupt a conversation and create a whole new path. During a scene when another character is talking, icons will appear to let you change the conversation with a Paragon move (good) or Renegade move (bad). Side plots tie into the main story more than in the first game, so even these chat-interrupting choices could have an impact later on. ""Things can happen in conversation,"" Hudson said when asked about the interrupt feature. ""It makes the conversation feel alive."" Work has already begun to complete the final chapter of the ""Mass Effect"" trilogy. And gamers shouldn't assume that Shepard makes it to the end of ""Mass Effect 3."" Hudson said Shepard can die a final death if the player makes wrong choices or inspires bad loyalty from his crew. ""We made it so you'll still get a satisfying ending, but yes, Shepard can actually die,"" he said.","Players who played the first ""Mass Effect"" game can import their data into the new game .
""Writing for 'ME2' was the hardest thing we've ever done,"" project director says .
""Mass Effect 2"" has 15% to 20% more dialogue and 30% more decision-making options ."
"(CNN) -- An Ohio inmate, convicted of killing and dismembering a 22-year-old woman in 1991, was executed Tuesday using a new, untested one-drug method of lethal injection, state officials said. Kenneth Biros, 51, was pronounced dead at 11:47 a.m. at a prison in Lucasville, Ohio, the state attorney general's office said in a written statement. His last words, according to Department of Rehabilitation and Correction spokeswoman Julie Walburn, were: ""Sorry from the bottom of my heart. I want to thank all of my family and friends for my prayers and who supported and believed in me. ""My father, now I'm being paroled to heaven,"" Biros said, according to Walburn. ""I will now spend all of my holidays with my lord and savior, Jesus Christ. Peace be with you all. Amen."" Biros' execution is the first in Ohio since September, when the governor and federal courts halted capital punishment in the state after a botched attempt to execute another prisoner, Romell Broom. The prison staff could not find a suitable vein for the injections. The one-drug method had never been tried on a U.S. death row inmate. It relies on a single dose of sodium thiopental injected into a vein. A separate two-drug muscle injection was available as a backup, officials said. The one-drug method has been used to euthanize animals. The same drug, sodium thiopental, at a much lower dosage, is the first ingredient in the three-drug method previously used in Ohio, as well as in all but one of the other 34 states that allow the death penalty. Some capital punishment opponents claim the sodium thiopental, which renders the prisoner unconscious, can wear off too quickly, and that some prisoners would actually be awake and able to feel pain as the procedure continues. Biros' execution was initially scheduled for 10 a.m., but preparations were delayed as officials waited for a ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on Biros' request for a stay, Walburn said. The high court without comment denied the request about 10 a.m., and ""we were about an hour behind"" in preparations, she said. The execution began around 11 a.m. Biros died about 10 minutes after the drugs began to flow, she said, but he was not officially pronounced dead until later. Biros, 51, was convicted of killing Tami Engstrom near the town of Warren. He met the woman at a bar and offered to drive her home, and later admitted robbing and attempting to rape her. Prosecutors said Biros dismembered Engstrom and spread her body parts around northeast Ohio and neighboring Pennsylvania. The crime was ""particularly heinous, with 91 pre-mortem wounds,"" according to the clemency report. Biros claimed he acted in a fit of drunken rage. He was involved in litigation challenging the three-drug method and received a stay of execution in 2007 because of his involvement in the suit, according to minutes of a November parole board meeting posted on the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Corrections' Web site. His attorney, Timothy Sweeney, had also objected to the one-drug method, saying it was unconstitutional. Sweeney wrote in an appeal that use of the one-drug method would amount to ""human experimentation, pure and simple."" But the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals last month denied Biros' request for a stay, concluding that since Ohio had announced it would change its protocol and rely on the one-drug method, Biros' argument regarding the three-drug method was moot. Biros' last meal was served about 7:45 p.m. Monday -- pizza with extra cheese, mushrooms, onions and green peppers, along with onion rings, deep-fried mushrooms, Doritos, french onion dip, blueberry ice cream, Dr Pepper and cherry pie, Walburn said. During its meeting last month, members of the state parole board heard a prerecorded statement from Engstrom's mother, Mary Jane Heiss, according to the meeting minutes. Heiss said her health was not good but she was saving her strength to attend Biros' execution. ""Since her daughter's death, she has endured nearly 20 years of constant pain and nightmares,"" the minutes said. ""She believes that the nightmares will end with the execution. It makes her sick that Biros tortured and brutally murdered her daughter."" The board voted 7-0 to deny Biros clemency. In attempting to execute Broom in September, authorities tried unsuccessfully for hours to find a vein to administer his lethal injection. Afterward, Gov. Ted Strickland announced he would delay the executions of two other men until March at the earliest. Broom's execution has not been rescheduled. Ohio has put 32 people to death in the past decade.

"Los Angeles, California (CNN) -- Dr. Conrad Murray, personal physician to Michael Jackson, was charged Monday with involuntary manslaughter in connection with the pop star's death last summer. A criminal complaint filed earlier in the day alleged that Murray ""did unlawfully, and without malice, kill Michael Joseph Jackson."" Murray turned himself in shortly before 4 p.m. at a branch courthouse near Los Angeles International Airport. He pleaded not guilty during a brief hearing before Judge Keith L. Schwartz. The judge set bail at $75,000, despite arguments from prosecutor David Walgren that Murray is a flight risk. The judge refused to suspend Murray's medical license as a term of his bond, but he did order him not to use any anesthesia on patients. ""I don't want you sedating people,"" Schwartz told Murray. Read the criminal complaint . The involuntary manslaughter charge means that Murray caused Jackson's death by acting ""without due caution and circumspection."" If convicted, Murray would face a maximum four-year prison sentence, according to prosecutors. More on involuntary manslaughter . Members of Michael Jackson's family -- including his parents Joe and Katherine Jackson, sister La Toya Jackson, and brothers Jackie, Jermaine, Randy and Tito Jackson -- attended the hearing. ""Not enough,"" Jermaine Jackson said when asked what he thought of the charge. ""I don't like what happened,"" Joe Jackson said as he left the courthouse. La Toya Jackson later issued a statement through a publicist. ""Michael was murdered and although he died at the hands of Dr. Conrad Murray, I believe Dr. Murray was a part of a much larger plan,"" her statement said. ""There are other individuals involved and I will not rest and I will continue to fight until all of the proper individuals are brought forth and justice is served."" Her statement did not elaborate on what she meant in her reference to ""a much larger plan."" Murray traveled to Los Angeles at the end of January from his home in Houston, Texas, in expectation of possible charges, his lawyer said. He used part of his time last week to visit the pop star's resting place in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California. Murray, a cardiologist, was hired as Jackson's personal physician last spring as the singer prepared for comeback concerts in London, England. The doctor told Los Angeles police that he was with Jackson at his $100,000-a-month rented Holmby Hills mansion through the early morning hours of June 25, 2009, in an effort to help the pop star fall asleep, according to a police affidavit. He administered sleep aids, and after Jackson finally began sleeping in the late morning hours, Murray said, he left the bedroom for ""about two minutes maximum,"" the affidavit says. ""Upon his return, Murray noticed that Jackson was no longer breathing,"" it says. The doctor stayed with Jackson as an ambulance rushed him to UCLA Medical Center. Efforts at CPR proved fruitless, and Jackson was pronounced dead at 2:26 p.m. The Los Angeles County coroner ruled Jackson's death a homicide, resulting from a combination of drugs, primarily propofol and lorazepam. The coroner's statement said Jackson died from ""acute propofol intoxication,"" but there were ""other conditions contributing to death: benzodiazepine effect."" Lorazepam and two other drugs Murray said he used are benzodiazepines. The doctor told investigators he had given Jackson three anti-anxiety drugs to help him sleep in the hours before he stopped breathing, a police affidavit said. Murray had been treating Jackson for insomnia for six weeks at the time of the singer's death. The doctor told investigators he gave Jackson 50 milligrams of propofol, the generic name for Diprivan, diluted with the anesthetic lidocaine every night via an intravenous drip. The doctor told police he was worried that Jackson was becoming addicted to the drug and tried to wean him off it. During the two nights before Jackson's death, Murray said, he put together combinations of other drugs that succeeded in helping Jackson sleep. The full autopsy report, which was released Monday afternoon, included an analysis by an anesthesiology consultant of the use of propofol. The consultant, Dr. Selma Calmes, concluded that the ""standard of care for administering propofol was not met."" ""There was no evidence of an infusion pump for control of an IV infusion. No monitors were found at the scene; a blood pressure cuff and portable pulse oximeter were recovered from a closet in the next room,"" Calmes wrote. An oxygen tank was found near where Jackson slept, but it was empty when the coroner investigator checked it two weeks after Jackson died, Calmes said. ""Multiple opened bottles of propofol were found with small amounts of remaining drugs,"" Calmes said. ""A used bottle should be discarded six hours after opening, to avoid possible bacterial growth."" ""The level of propofol found on toxicology exam are similar to those found during general anesthesia for major surgery,"" Calmes said. During such surgery, any patient would be ""intubated and ventilated by an anesthesiologist,"" she said. The consultant's report said that the level of lorazepam found in Jackson ""would have accentuated the respiratory and cardiovascular depression from propofol.""

"(CNN) -- A Texas inmate who escaped last week -- on foot even though he was thought to need a wheelchair -- has been recaptured, the U.S. Marshals Service said Monday. Arcade Comeaux Jr., 49, was carrying two loaded pistols when he was arrested without incident at 7:40 a.m. at a business in Houston, Texas, said U.S. Deputy Marshal Alfredo Perez. ""[Comeaux] was cold, wet, tired and hungry. He had had enough,"" Perez said. ""He was tired of running."" The arrest was made by two Houston police officers responding to a suspicious-person call about a man who matched Comeaux's description. Comeaux was sitting in the lobby a northeast Houston business, apparently in search of warmth and shelter, when officers approached, according to Houston officer Adrian Rodriguez. ""As soon as we saw him, we knew it was him,"" Rodriguez said at a news conference Monday afternoon. Comeaux was serving three life sentences when he escaped on November 30 while being transferred by two armed guards from Huntsville to Stiles. He produced a weapon and forced the two correctional officers to drive instead to Baytown, near Houston, where he handcuffed them together in the back of the van, took their weapons and one of their uniforms and ran away, officials said. Perez said authorities haven't confirmed whether the two pistols found on Comeaux Monday are the guards' weapons, ""but they look to be the same."" Perez said the marshals service had fielded hundreds of calls of sightings by citizens over the past week, and were responding to a Crimestoppers tip in the same area when they saw Comeaux taken into police custody. More than $30,000 in reward money had been posted by law enforcement agencies for information leading to his arrest. Comeaux was being transported Monday afternoon back into the custody of the Texas prison system, Perez said. Comeaux, who was on the marshals' list of 15 most-wanted fugitives, was serving time for aggravated sexual assault and two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon when he escaped. The 6-foot, 200-pound man was shackled and in a wheelchair, which he had said was needed for mobility, according to Michelle Lyons, director of public information for the Texas Department of Criminal Justice in Huntsville. Some 45 minutes into the transfer trip, as they were driving through Conroe, 40 minutes north of Houston, the prisoner pulled out a pistol and ordered the guards to drive south to Baytown. He fired once, but hit no one, officials said. Law enforcement officers found the unharmed officers an hour later. Comeaux was being transferred so he could be near a hospital in Galveston for treatment of the supposed paralysis he had suffered during a reported stroke, officials said. Comeaux's criminal record dates back more than three decades. In 1979, he received three 10-year sentences for rape of a child, aggravated rape of a child, and burglary of a building with the intent to commit theft, all in Harris County. He was released on mandatory supervision in 1983, but he was returned to prison in 1984 after being convicted of indecency with a child and sentenced to 20 years. In June 1991, he was released on mandatory supervision but returned as a violator four months later. Paroled in December 1993, he was returned as a parole violator a year later. In February 1996, he was again paroled, but was returned to prison in June 1998 with a life sentence for aggravated sexual assault. Though he had been in prison since, his criminal record didn't end. In July 1999, he used his wheelchair to pin his wife against a wall during a contact visit and stabbed her 17 times with a homemade knife, said John Moriarty, inspector general of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice. He also stabbed another prison visitor who tried to intervene; both victims survived. For that, Comeaux was convicted on two counts of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and received two additional life sentences. He now will face additional felony charges. His escape led the legislator whose committee oversees Texas' criminal justice system to call for a shakeup of the prison system. ""We just can't have security breaches of this nature,"" said Sen. John Whitmire, a Democrat from Houston who is chairman of the state Senate's Criminal Justice Committee. Moriarty said such lapses are highly unusual in the state's penal system. ""We have no open gun investigations other than this one,"" he said. ""The last one was several years ago.""","NEW:  Arcade Comeaux Jr. was ""cold, wet, tired and hungry,"" official says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- China's worst winter in more than half a century showed no signs of abating Wednesday as forecasters warned of three more days of snow and sleet. Stranded passengers wait to get into the railway station at Wuhan in central China's Hubei province . The weather has paralyzed transportation, frozen the power grid and delivered a $4.5 billion hit to the economy, according to figures released Wednesday by the Civil Affairs Ministry. The situation is compounding economic problems for China. Destroyed crops have resulted in increased food prices, while the inability to transport goods has further inflated prices and led to shortages at stores. China's railways and roads are the lifeblood for its manufacturing sector, one of the fastest growing in the world. ""Being a manufacturer, we are so worried,"" said marketing manager Calvina Chan, who works for a Hong Kong-based firm that relies on a factory in mainland China to produce luggage for brands such as Samsonite. ""Because of the snowstorm, the transportation isn't very good and so there might be a late delivery."" Automakers Toyota and Ford halted their China-based production this week. The transportation stoppage has had a domino effect, preventing the delivery of coal, which is vital to China's power plants. That is amplifying China's energy problems. ""Most of the coal is produced in the north and northeast, (while) the users are along the coast,"" said economist Nicholas Kwan. ""This time the snowstorm's problem is not so much freezing the production but freezing the transportation line which makes transportation of coal to those power plants more difficult."" Kwan said some of the power plants have already depleted their coal reserves. All this comes during the Lunar New Year holiday, the country's busiest shopping season. In Guangzhou, hundreds of factory workers who had saved money all year to visit their families during China's Lunar New Year filled the city's train station, waiting for trains that were not expected to arrive for days. Up to half a million people have camped out in the southern city for nearly a week, hoping to get home for the holiday. Factories in the province of Guangzhou shut down Wednesday ahead of the February 7 holiday with workers joining the masses around the train station -- hoping the government would deliver on its promise of quick action and immediate relief for those trying to make it home. ""I have been sleeping out here for six days. I have spent all my money. I don't know how I will get home,"" one man said. Another man told CNN's Hugh Riminton he had tried to get out of Guangzhou every way possible -- by airplane, bus and his own car -- but could not make it because of the weather conditions. ""Now he's in the queue with everyone else trying to get on a train,"" Riminton said. ""And the trains simply aren't going at the moment and it's unlikely they'll be going really in sufficient numbers for days to come"" Security is tight at the railway station as people occasionally stampeded the barricade in an attempt to get closer to the train platforms, to no avail. Armed riot police entered the station on Wednesday to regain control of the situation. So far, Chinese authorities have managed to persuade nearly 470,000 people to abandon their travel plans and accept a refund for their train tickets. Prime Minister Wen Jiabao apologized Tuesday to the hundreds of thousands of people stranded in train stations across his country -- a rare move by a Chinese politician. ""First we'll fix the electric grid. After that, the trains will run again. ... Then all of you can go home for the Chinese New Year,"" the premier said. President Hu Jintao called an emergency meeting of the policy-making politburo and vowed a quick government response. More than 177 million Chinese were expected to travel by train, and 22 million more by plane, for Chinese Lunar New Year, also known as the Spring Festival. ""Going home every year is an obligation,"" one Chinese woman explained. ""It is family reunion, and no matter how difficult it is, we have to do it."" Brian Blackwell of Chicago was stranded for two days at Shanghai's Hongqiao International Airport. ""There were thousands of people there and they were pushing toward the counter. You had no idea what the status of your flight was."" Brutal winter weather has pounded China's central, eastern and southern sections. In its 10-day forecast, the China Meteorological Administration said Wednesday that southwestern, eastern and southern China can expect more snow and sleet with freezing temperatures, while northern China will stay clear but windy. The winter precipitation had caused at least 49 deaths due to collapsed roofs and treacherous travel conditions, the Ministry of Civil Affairs and local officials said. Nearly a million police have been dispatched to help keep roadways open as thousands of vehicles have become stranded in the snow and ice, according to Chinese Ministry of Public Safety spokesman Wu Heping.

"Livermore, California (CNN) -- The new START arms control agreement with Russia calls for the United States to significantly reduce its nuclear stockpile, but critics are rightly asking whether this will leave the U.S. safe. They say the U.S. must maintain a healthy nuclear deterrent, even as it works toward President Obama's goal of a world free of nuclear weapons. That leaves questions about the quality of the nuclear weapons the U.S. will keep in its arsenal, which are aging. Are they safe? Are they reliable? And, given that the United States stopped testing nuclear weapons by blowing them up -- both above and below ground -- 18 years ago, how will we know? Those are some of the questions that CNN's Foreign Affairs Correspondent Jill Dougherty and I sought to answer when we flew to Northern California for an exclusive tour of the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. At Livermore, it is all about virtual testing. Scientists actually generate the conditions of a nuclear weapon to analyze the nuclear stockpiles to make sure they are functioning correctly. The word ""cool"" does not begin to describe it. First, Brian Cracciola showed us around Livermore's High Explosives Applications Facility, where he is the operations manager. At HEAF, scientists conduct up to 1,000 explosions a year and heat up explosives to react to thermal changes. He walked us into a tank that can blow up 22 pounds of explosives. ""When and if the president ever has to push that button, we need to know that the weapons will work,"" Cracciola said. ""And as we scale down the nuclear weapons, we are working to make them much safer and much more reliable."" Bruce Goodwin, who runs the weapons program at Livermore, explained that high-explosive molecule testing is even more extensive than the traditional testing done before 1992, when a nuclear test involved blowing up a nuclear weapon. ""There are hundreds of ways a nuclear device can fail,"" Goodwin told us ""We catalogue those and we test against them in a non-nuclear fashion. And, more importantly, we can do complete three-dimensional simulations of things that you couldn't possibly test in the old days."" At Livermore, you can cut the explosives in half by laser without melting or sparking. We learned that this means you don't disturb the atoms inside the high explosive. Goodwin said the test vibrates the atoms at a rate of a millionth-billionth of a second, so fast that heat and shock waves can't be conducted. This removes the atoms one at a time from the high explosive and provides a more accurate reading of the condition of the explosive. ""We found failure modes in the stockpile that we could never have found with nuclear testing because we're able to do these massive simulations,"" he said. ""These are the largest calculations that man has ever done."" All of these simulations are cataloged on Livermore's supercomputers, which are some of the fastest in the world. Michel McCoy, the lab's associate director for computation, showed us around the supercomputer rooms, which he calls the lab's ""crown jewel."" There, thousands of computers pull together all of the physics necessary to model a nuclear weapon's reliability and safety. Did I mention these computers are fast? We are talking about a hundred trillion operations per second. It is about to get even faster, with a new computer system called the petaflop, which would be able to do about a quintillion operations per second. McCoy said even that isn't fast enough for what the U.S. needs to do to fix the nuclear weapons as they age. We ended our day at Livermore's National Ignition Facility, where the world's largest laser generates the temperatures and pressures found only in stars, the sun and in nuclear weapons. The equipment looks like a spaceship about to take off. This summer, NIF will begin experiments that will focus the energy of 192 giant laser beams on a tiny target filled with hydrogen fuel. The goal is to obtain fusion energy, which is what powers the sun and stars. Inside the target chamber, the target that each of the lasers needs to hit is smaller than the diameter of a human hair. The director of the NIF, Edward Moses, showed us a full-scale target, which can fit in his hand. Inside a little gold can is a red dot the size of a pencil eraser. There, Moses said, ""the isotopes of hydrogen sit ... and get ready to be blown to bits."" ""We can model parts of physical processes that go on inside a weapon without testing,"" Moses said. ""This is the only place in the world where you can get to the nuclear phase of the weapon without blowing up a bomb."" In fact, we found that at Livermore, scientists could learn more about what's going on inside a nuclear weapon without actually testing it than they can with a nuclear test. Every night, the control room, modeled on NASA's command center, runs a laser experiment using 2,000 computers and 60,000 control points. ""We're finally at the point with this laser facility and our computers and with other facilities for the first time to do this kind of thing,"" Moses said. ""And I think this is why President Obama probably has more confidence -- one of the many reasons he has -- to go forward with this new policy.""","Critics wonder: Would the new START arms pact with Russia leave the U.S. vulnerable?

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- The death of a 14-year-old girl in England after she received a vaccination for Human Papilloma virus (HPV) has prompted a widespread freeze on the country's national vaccination program. Millions of girls have received vaccinations for HPV since 2008, the virus that causes 99 percent of cervical cancers. More than 1.4 million girls have received the vaccination in England since the National Health Service (NHS) started administering it in September 2008. Natalie Morton's sudden death Monday occurred within hours after she received a shot of the vaccine Cervarix at the NHS at her school in  Coventry. Three other girls at the Blue Coat Church of England school suffered mild symptoms of dizziness and nausea after receiving the vaccine, according to media reports. It remains unclear if the vaccine caused Morton's death. Only an autopsy will be able to determine the exactly cause of death. Glaxo Smith Kline, the manufacturer of Cervarix, issued a recall of the batch of vaccine used in Coventry as a ""precautionary measure.""  Watch reaction to Natalie Morton's death » . ""At this stage the cause of this tragic death is unknown,"" the company said in a statement posted on their Web site. ""Following immediate quarantine of the batch involved last night, we have taken the decision to voluntarily recall this batch as a further precautionary measure while the investigation into the circumstances surrounding Natalie's death is conducted."" On Tuesday several NHS clinics and schools indefinitely postponed immunizations. ""As a purely precautionary measure, we have asked the NHS to quarantine all stocks of HPV vaccine from the batch related to this case,"" a spokesperson for the NHS said. ""Where the local NHS has supplies of vaccine from other production batches, they should continue with the vaccination program."" Many clinics were forced to close as they checked the numbers on their batches of the vaccine. What is HPV? HPV stands for human Papilloma virus. Although there are more than 100 types of HPV, only a few of them are known to cause cervical cancer. Most strains of HPV are harmless or cause genital warts. HPV is a common sexually-transmitted disease. Almost half of all women who have sex will be infected at one point in their life, according to the British National Health Service. HPV infects the cells of the surface of the cervix. Infections can clear up on their own or stay for many years without any symptoms and develop into cervical cancer. Ninety-nine percent of cervical cancers are caused by HPV. What is the Cervarix HPV vaccine? The Cervarix HPV vaccine protects against the two strains of HPV (16 and 18) that cause cervical cancer in over 70 percent of women. The vaccine is typically injected in the upper arm, or thigh, in three doses within six months, and is recommended for teenage girls. How effective is the Cervarix vaccine? According to the manufacturer, Glaxo Smith Kline, Cervarix is over 99 percent effective. Is Cervarix the most common vaccine for HPV? No. Gardisil, manufactured by Merck is used by the majority of vaccine programs worldwide. Gardisil protects against four strains of HPV (16, 18, 6 and 11). Strains 6 and 11 cause less serious conditions, such as genital warts. Gardisil proved comparatively effective in trials carried out by Merck. Of 23 million American girls who have already been vaccinated, 32 deaths were reported, though the reports do not determine if the deaths were caused by the vaccine or just a coincidence. Why was Cervarix chosen for the UK? According to the NHS, Cervarix, ""was selected because the bid from this company scored higher than the competitor in the adjudication process against pre-agreed award criteria. The pre-agreed award criteria were shared with the manufacturers during the process so that they were fully informed of the criteria against which their bids would be evaluated."" When was the vaccine introduced? In September 2008, England began a national program to vaccinate girls aged 12-13, and a three-year catch up campaign offering the vaccine to 13-18 year old girls. Do condoms protect against HPV? Using condoms reduces the risk of HPV transmission, but infection is still possible because HPV can be spread by contact with parts of the body that the condom does not cover. What are the known dangers associated with taking the HPV vaccine? Cervarix has undergone rigorous safety testing as part of the licensing process required in the UK and other European countries, according to the NHS. The most commonly reported side effects are mild swelling or pain at the injection site, nausea, a mild temperature, dizziness, diarrhea and muscle aches. In rare cases allergic reactions in the form of skin rashes and in very rare cases anaphylactic shock has occurred.","Teenage girl dies after receiving Cervarix vaccination for HPV .

"(CNN) -- Maicon and Samuel Eto'o were both on target in the second half to give champions Inter Milan a 2-0 win over 10-man Juventus, a result that sees Jose Mourinho's side return to the top of the Serie A table. The win, only Inter's fourth in 12 league matches, sends them back to the top of the table by two points from Roma -- who can reclaim top spot if they beat Lazio in the Rome derby on Sunday. A cagey first-half exploded into life eight minutes before the interval when Juve midfielder Mo Sissoko received a second yellow card for a late challenge on Javier Zanetti. The 10-men bravely held out until the 75th minute when Inter took a stunning lead through defender Miacon. The Brazilian juggled the ball over Amauri on the edge of the area before firing a superb strike past goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Mario Balotelli then struck the crossbar with a free-kick before the points were sealed in the final minute when Samuel Eto'o was left unmarked in the area to slide home a Sulley Muntari cross.","Maicon and Samuel Eto'o on target to send Inter Milan back to the top of Serie A .

"(CNN) -- Fatmire Feka glanced at the skies over her Kosovo village. Storm clouds darkened the horizon, and rain started to fall. ""I felt as if God was crying tears of pain,"" Feka says. ""God was crying because he knew what was about to happen."" It was a chilly Tuesday morning on April 20, 1999, and Feka was on the run. Village guards had warned her family that Serbian paramilitary units were rounding up Albanian Muslims for execution. She ran out of her home with her family and fled to a nearby forest to hide. As the 11-year-old Feka headed to the forest, she could hear bombs exploding and rifle shots crackle behind her. What happened next would leave Feka with nightmares that remain to this day. She would lose her older brother, Sami, and her older sister, Sadete. Both are still missing. Feka, now 22, is an internationally known peace advocate who travels around the world talking about reconciliation. Yet she admits that talking about forgiveness is far easier than practicing it. ""I have been struggling with this forgiveness thing,'' she says. ""I cannot forgive anyone because I don't know what happened to my brother and sister. I don't know who took them, for what reason, and who I am supposed to forgive?"" Why the 'truth must be spoken' It's a long way from Kosovo to Afghanistan, but Feka's story offers some insight into the difficulties that may await the Afghan people. NATO forces are escalating attacks against the Taliban. Yet many observers say only a negotiated settlement with the Taliban will ultimately bring peace to Afghanistan. Read more about other nations' lessons for Afghanistan . But the challenges would not end with a settlement. Afghans who saw their loved ones brutalized or murdered by the Taliban will face the same challenge that Feka faces: How do I live again with the people who caused me so much pain? The short answer is forgive them and move on. Feka's experience, though, suggests that doing so can take years and be excruciatingly difficult. Feka says that before she could forgive, ""the truth must be spoken."" She wanted to know what happened to her brother and sister. ""If I know the truth -- who did it and for what reason -- I will be able to make peace,"" she says. How Feka moved on . Feka says she thought she would die on the last day she saw her brother and sister. When she ran for her life, she says she saw dead bodies on the side of the road. While resting at night, she could hear screams and shots in the distance. During a recent speech, Feka told her audience about one image from her journey that set her and the other children on edge. ""I remember children were crying, but what scared us the most were that adults were crying, too."" She says she lost contact with her brother and sister after her family decided to split up. Her 19-year-old sister, Sadete, and her 17-year-old brother, Sami, decided to accompany her uncle as he made a run for a safe region in Northern Kosovo. Her uncle returned four days later, alone and bleeding from a bullet wound to his shoulder. He said Serbians had attacked them, and he could not remember what had happened to Feka's brother and sister. Feka says she hated Serbians after her siblings' disappearance. Then she met Rudy Scholaert, then a manager for World Vision, an international Christian humanitarian organization. Feka's family was staying in a homeless shelter with other Muslim families. Scholaert taught English to the kids in the shelter and talked to them about moving beyond revenge and violence. One day, Scholaert says he gave the kids crayons and paper. He asked them to draw what peace meant to them. The kids drew pictures of burned-out homes, tanks and guns -- except for Feka. ""She drew a beautiful home with red flowers, trees, birds and a bright sun,"" Scholaert says. ""She then said to me: 'This was my home before the fighting. This was a peaceful place. I wish we could go back to this time.' "" With World Vision's support, Feka founded ""Kids Clubs for Peace"" after she turned 12. The club uses meetings, skits and songs to bring together youth from differing ethnicities in Kosovo. Feka's message, though, wasn't something some of her Muslims neighbors wanted to hear. She was criticized by other Muslims. She says her mother once slapped her for being a public advocate for peace. ""When I started to work for peace, everyone perceived me as deviant,"" she says. ""Fighting was normal. Hating each other was normal."" The meeting that transformed Feka . What helped Feka change wasn't a march but a meeting with another Serbian. When she was 16, she attended a World Vision summer camp that brought together Serbian and Muslim youths. One day, a Serbian teenager asked Feka to share her story. After Feka did, she noticed something odd. The Serbian teenager was crying. And so were the other Serbian children in the room. ""That was such a powerful thing,"" she says. ""That not only changed my life, but all the children in the room. I realized that not all Serbians are bad."" Scholaert, the World Vision worker who first encouraged her, says he visited Feka at the camp and saw her change. ""Fatmire was so proud to introduce me to her new Serbian friends and to show me the Serbian words that she had learned,"" Scholaert says. ""She really did want to make things right at an early age."" Others started to notice. In 2005, Feka was selected as one of the ""1,000 Women of Peace across the Globe."" The women were subsequently nominated for a Nobel Peace Prize. Today, Feka speaks at rallies and peace conferences around the world. She also has a new home. Scholaert, the World Vision worker, has put Feka and her two younger sisters up in an apartment in Toronto, Canada. He made a bet with Feka when she was a girl: Do well in school, and I'll pay for your education. Feka now attends a university in the multicultural city of Toronto. She says releasing her hatred of Serbians has been liberating. ""Working for peace was the best thing I ever did."" Other burdens remain, though. Feka says she used to pray to God about her sisters and brother every day. But she recently stopped. ""It has been 11 years, me praying every single day without missing a day,"" she says in her heavily accented English. ""But [God] hasn't helped."" Her mother remains in Kosovo. Feka says her mother wants to be there in case some word comes about Feka's sister and brother. But the waiting and the not knowing is brutal, Feka says. ""We wish their bodies could rest in peace,"" she says. ""It's difficult to wait every day, every hour, every minute for some news to come."" On some nights, Feka dreams of reuniting with her brother and sister. But not all the dreams are reassuring. She had one recent dream when her sister tried to cross a river and was swept away. She pleaded for Feka's help, but Feka couldn't save her. Her war may be over, but Feka says it still leaves its mark. When she walks through the streets of Toronto, Feka says she marvels at how easily Canadians of varying ethnicities get along. It still doesn't seem real to her. In some of those moments, she says she feels like the 11-year-old girl in Kosovo who saw God cry tears of pain. ""This is a dream life,"" she says. ""I'm not used to this. I will never get used to it.""","Fatmire Feka lost her siblings in Kosovo in 1999 and hated Serbians for years .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Republicans were facing pressure Tuesday to vote for a rollback of across-the-board cuts in Medicare payments to health providers after a major doctors' group said the cuts could lead to a ""meltdown"" of the government's health care system for the elderly. Doctors say they would take on fewer Medicare patients if the cuts go into effect. On Monday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called several Republicans trying to persuade them to support a bill that would reverse a 10.6 percent cut in Medicare payments to doctors. The cuts in Medicare payments -- part of a scheduled cost-saving formula -- went into effect July 1, although the Bush administration said it will hold off on processing claims until mid-July to give Congress time to reach a compromise. The Medicare system pays for the health care of roughly 40 million elderly Americans. Rising health care costs have made Medicare a growing part of the federal budget, and the stress on the system is increasing as more baby boomers reach retirement age. Similar cuts have been scheduled to go into effect on July 1 in previous years, but Congress always has voted to stop the cuts before they went into effect. Gerald Harmon, a family physician who practices in Pawleys Island, South Carolina, said the cuts could lead to doctors taking fewer Medicare patients, making it difficult for the program's elderly patients to get the care they need. ""This Medicare access problem is a real issue, not just a political football,"" said Harmon, who said 35 percent of his patients were eligible for Medicare. ""It affects your dad, when he's sick. It affects my patients in my practice. This has to be addressed."" A vote on the bill last week fell one shy of the 60 needed to clear a Republican filibuster and advance in the Senate. Senate Republicans joined the White House in objecting to the Democratic-back bill because it paid for the increased payments to doctors by trimming government support for private insurance programs that provide coverage to Medicare patients. The private Medicare programs are a top policy initiative for Republicans. The issue has become the subject of an intense election-year lobbying and advertising campaign aimed primarily at its GOP opponents. The American Medical Association, a powerful doctor's group, said its members may be forced to reduce service to Medicare patients if the cuts go into effect. According to a recent association survey, 60 percent of physicians will be forced to limit the number of new Medicare patients they can take on if the July 1 cuts go into effect. ""We stand at the brink of a Medicare meltdown. ... For doctors, this is not a partisan issue -- it's a patient access issue,"" AMA President Nancy Nielsen said in a statement after the Senate vote last week. The AMA ran radio and TV ads over the July Fourth congressional recess targeting 10 Republican senators, seven of whom are up for re-election. The AARP, the nation's largest organization of retired persons, and other groups also are weighing in against the cuts. Reid has ""no idea"" if the pressure has changed any minds, but the ""proof will be in the pudding"" when senators vote again to break the filibuster, said Jim Manley, a spokesman for the speaker. That vote is likely to occur Wednesday. ""There is clearly a lot of pressure,"" Sen. Max Baucus, D-Montana, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said Monday. Baucus said he has talked to several Republicans and ""there are a few"" who could switch their votes. But GOP lawmakers and aides gave no indication the intense lobbying had changed any minds, and even if the bill does pass the Senate, it may still face a presidential veto. Republicans ""are holding out for a compromise that can pass and the president can sign,"" said a top GOP leadership aide. At the heart of the dispute is the decision by Democratic lawmakers to pay for the ""doctors' fix"" by cutting funds for Medicare Advantage, a program administered by private insurance companies that is generally favored by Republicans and opposed by Democrats. The program, which has more benefits than traditional Medicare, is also more expensive. Republicans -- joined by the insurance industry -- fear Democrats are trying to weaken the Medicare alternative by draining funds away from it. President Bush has threatened to veto the legislation because of the cuts to Medicare Advantage -- so that even if Democrats get one additional vote to beat a filibuster, they will need several more to override a veto. The House of Representatives passed the bill 359-55 with broad Republican support in June, but the two-thirds vote needed to override a presidential veto appears, at the moment, to be an insurmountable barrier in the Senate. ""Our goal is to get a result,"" said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. ""A vetoed bill is not a result."" McConnell on Monday pressed for a monthlong extension of the current fee schedule so senators could work on a compromise.

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Caroline Wozniacki hopes to be fit for this year's second grand slam tournament, the French Open, despite suffering an ankle injury in an American event. The Dane had to retire hurt during her semifinal match against Russian seventh seed Vera Zvonareva in Charleston, South Carolina, on Saturday while trailing 5-2 in the first set. The top seed slipped on the green clay in the sixth game and rolled her ankle, meaning Zvonareva went through to Sunday's final where she will face Australian Samantha Stosur. Wozniacki, who won the WTA Tour tournament in Ponte Vedra Beach last weekend, told reporters that she hoped to be able to play at Roland Garros when play begins on May 24. ""I certainly hope so. As it looks right now, it's not too bad,"" said the 19-year-old, who will have a scan on the injury. ""I was surprised that I could stand on my leg, which was very positive, actually. ""But as soon as I was moving to the sides, it was impossible, so I couldn't play."" Fourth seed Stosur reached the final of the Family Circle Cup with a 6-3 7-6 (7-2) victory against No. 8 Daniela Hantuchova of Slovakia.

"(CNN) -- After emerging as victor in the long and bruising contest to seize the Democratic nomination for the U.S. presidential race, Barack Obama's next move is to choose a running mate. And that search for a vice president is getting some added support. Caroline Kennedy has joined Obama's vice presidential selection team, a campaign spokesman said Wednesday. Former Fannie Mae CEO Jim Johnson is heading up the search team, and former Deputy U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder is also serving on the committee. Kennedy, the daughter of President Kennedy, formally endorsed Obama late January in a New York Times op-ed piece titled, ""A President Like My Father."" ""I have never had a president who inspired me the way people tell me that my father inspired them,"" Kennedy wrote. ""But for the first time, I believe I have found the man who could be that president -- not just for me, but for a new generation of Americans."" Sen. Hillary Clinton, whose tenacious refusal to surrender the nomination contest turned the Democratic race into one of the most nail-biting in modern U.S. political history, has indicated that she would be willing to sign up on a joint ticket.

"(CNN) -- A Buffalo, New York, man is due in court Thursday to face charges that he raped a 13-year-old runaway police say he held prisoner in his home for six months. Michael J. Abdallah, 26, has pleaded not guilty to second-degree rape, unlawful imprisonment and custodial interference. Thursday's hearing will determine if the case should be referred to a grand jury. Buffalo police said that Abdallah kept the girl in his home from July through December 2009, behind dead-bolt locks and doors with no doorknobs. A criminal complaint alleges that Abdallah had sex with her more than 100 times. Police spokesman Michael DeGeorge said Abdallah also forced the girl to baby-sit his year-old son. Abdallah is unmarried, and the identity of the child's mother is not known. Police would not say how the girl left Adbdallah's home, why there was a delay from December to February for his arrest or where the teenager is now. Abdallah was arrested Friday when police raided his home on a child-abuse allegation, Buffalo media reported. The next day, Buffalo City Court Judge James A.W. McLeod set bond at $250,000 in an arraignment at which Abdallah represented himself. He has since been provided with a court-appointed attorney, according to media reports. But friends of the defendant told the Buffalo News that he was nothing more than a Good Samaritan trying to help a runaway girl he met in a Buffalo park. ""Everybody has had their moments, but Mike is not a monster. As long as I've known Mike, he's always been kindhearted to me. If he could help you, he will help you,"" Alicia Bellaus, 20, who grew up next door to Abdallah's relatives, told the paper. ""Mike always had her calling to someone, supposedly her aunt, to say she was doing OK. From what I knew, her aunt or her mom knew where she was staying,"" said Bellaus, who previously had a romantic relationship with Abdallah. ""To look at her, she is very developed physically, and you would think that she is older than 13."" Bellaus said the girl told her she was 17 or 18 and denied having sex with Abdallah, and that she also said she did not want to go home to her mother, the News said. Police told the News that the family filed several missing person reports after the girl disappeared in July. And an unnamed law enforcement official told the paper that Abdallah was a manipulative drug dealer who ""lured her in"" and kept her trapped physically and psychologically. CNN, however, could not confirm that official's view. George Kimble, who lives four doors from Abdallah, said he was surprised when he learned about the accusations. ""This is a street where everyone knows everyone,"" said Kimble, who remembered Abdallah moving in about a year-and-a-half ago. ""I never recall him with a 13-year-old girl."" Kimble said Abdallah was seldom home, and their brief conversations were limited to Abdallah's two dogs. Other neighbors told Kimble the house had a steady stream of visitors on any given day.","Buffalo, New York, man has pleaded not guilty to second-degree rape .

"(CNN) -- The Southeast is among the areas of the United States with the highest concentration of cases of HIV and AIDS, according to a new online tool called the National HIV/AIDS Atlas. In this map of AIDS prevalence rates in the Southeast, red represents the highest (0.593 percent or greater). AIDS experts in the region say that access to health care, especially when it comes to screening, is a major problem in rural communities. In the Southeast, people with HIV tend to get tested late, after they have become sick, partly because of stigma, said Kathie Hiers, executive director of AIDS Alabama in Birmingham. ""If you look at access to health care and almost any kind of health care report card, the South is the worst,"" she said. With little or no public transportation, people in non-metropolitan areas are at a disadvantage when they need to see a particular kind of doctor, experts say. There is also a shortage of doctors who deal with HIV in the region, Hiers said. These problems also resonate with Georgia's rural communities, which represent 39 percent of the HIV/AIDS burden in the state, said Raphael Holloway, director of the HIV Unit at the Georgia Division of Public Health. The remaining 61 percent of people living with HIV or AIDS are in the metro Atlanta area. ""In some districts, for example, there may be 10 counties within that health district but only one infectious disease doctor that people can access for care and services,"" he said. It is also difficult to get HIV education to people in rural areas, he said. Of the 29 states reporting county-level data for the National HIV/AIDS Atlas, Georgia had more counties than any other state with the highest levels of HIV and AIDS prevalence. Although this does not represent a comprehensive national assessment, Georgia ranked fifth in reporting of new AIDS cases in 2007, behind Texas (fourth), Florida (third), New York (second) and California (first), according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Northeast also has a heavy burden of HIV/AIDS cases nationally, atlas collaborators said. Other states with high numbers of counties with high HIV prevalence included Florida, New York and South Carolina. The atlas, the first of its kind to map out HIV and AIDS at the level of counties, launched in time for Saturday's HIV/AIDS Testing Day. The National Institutes of Health is encouraging everyone age 13 to 64 to get tested for HIV as part of routine health care. ""Not knowing one's HIV status endangers one's health and the health of one's sexual partners. By getting tested for the virus and learning one's HIV status soon after infection, treatment can begin early, substantially delaying the development of HIV-related illness and prolonging life,"" said Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health. The National HIV/AIDS Atlas allows users to explore the prevalence of HIV and AIDS in any region of the United States. The map, a project of the National Minority Quality Forum, encompasses all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. The more red a region appears, the greater the prevalence, which is the ratio of the number of people living with the disease at a given time to the total number of people living there at that time. Users can look at rates of disease by gender, race/ethnicity and age group in regions where this information is available. The map also has different settings for HIV and AIDS, the more severe illness caused by the HIV virus. They can also zoom into counties and, for New York City only, ZIP codes. About 33 million people have HIV/AIDS worldwide as of 2007, according to the World Health Organization. The CDC estimates that 1.1 million Americans have HIV and that 56,300 new infections occurred in the United States in 2006. Nearly 75 percent of HIV/AIDS diagnoses among adolescents and adults in that year were for males. People who worked on the atlas project were surprised at how concentrated HIV and AIDS are in certain U.S. counties. ""Being able to look at all the data in this way reminds us that the HIV epidemic is not uniformly distributed throughout the U.S.,"" said Patrick Sullivan, associate professor of epidemiology at Emory University, who collaborated on the atlas. The atlas also reflects the disproportionate number of African-Americans who have HIV and AIDS. ""You can see at the level of the national map that there's so much variation in the U.S. about which groups have been impacted,"" Sullivan said. Demographics and county-level data are not available for some states, or parts of some states, because of the way these places report data by region, researchers said. These areas appear as gray when users zoom in. Some places also appear gray because the disease case count is so low. The atlas is based on data from public health departments from 2006, the most recent available. Collaborators say they hope to update the maps when new data become available. The atlas, which launched Monday morning, had about 100,000 visitors by Tuesday afternoon, and more than 10,000 people completed the free registration in that time, said Gary Puckrein, executive director of the atlas project.

"PICHER, Oklahoma (CNN) -- Wearing powder blue pants and a plaid fedora, 84-year-old Orval ""Hoppy"" Ray arrived fashionably late to a celebration in Picher, Oklahoma, a vacated mining town at the center of one of the nation's largest and most polluted toxic-waste sites. Hoppy Ray, 84, was among the last people to leave the toxic town of Picher, Oklahoma. Former residents, bought out by the government because their town was deemed so dangerous, gathered in Picher's elementary school to say farewell to a place where kids suffered lead poisoning, where homes built atop underground mines plunged into the Earth and where the local creek coughs up orange water, laced with heavy metals. A toothpick dangling out of the corner of his chapped mouth, Ray greeted several old friends as if he were in any other small town in America. ""Hello there, Hoppy! How the hell are ya?"" one called out. Gray mountains of toxic gravel loomed behind the school, just out of sight, as Hoppy hobbled past a bundle of balloons and through the front doors, cane in hand. He tipped his hat as he entered. ""Looks like a good crowd,"" he said. ""Everybody seems to be havin' a good time. That's the main thing."" In a town this tragic and for a person as stubborn as Hoppy, that's a big statement. As his abandoned town fades to dust, Hoppy has gone into the business of memories. He wants to remind townspeople, and the world, that a person's home should always be loved -- no matter how toxic.  See Hoppy share memories of Picher » . * * * * * . Hoppy didn't understand what all of the fuss was about. It was 2006, and the federal government announced it would pay people to leave Picher and the Tar Creek Superfund Site, which is part of the government's toxic-waste cleanup program. A report had found that much of the area was at risk of collapsing into the extensive lead and zinc mines.  Timeline: How Picher became toxic » . The buyout plan was seen as a blessing by some scared families. But not Hoppy. Hoppy swore he wouldn't leave his hometown, that he would die before he'd leave Picher, even if his electricity and water were turned off. He'd grown up there, worked in the mines alongside his father -- and all three of his brothers. But Picher was more than a place to make money. It was a place of patriotism and purpose: The metals they dug out of caves deep in the ground were processed and turned into bullets that armed U.S. soldiers in both world wars. The wars ended, though, and so did the world's interest in Picher. By 1970, the last mine shut down. Hoppy's family stayed. They couldn't leave a place that had threaded itself into their lives so deeply. * * * * * . After making a quick stop in the crowded school cafeteria, Hoppy found a more suitable post on the sidelines of the reunion, in a narrow hallway. He sat in a chair with a smirk on his face, using his cane to ping friends in the shins, or sometimes in the groin, to get their attention. ""This here's the last man standing,"" one man said, chuckling, as he stopped by Hoppy's seat. Hoppy's son and grandson arrived with several cardboard boxes of books, pulled from the bed of the old miner's pickup. With the help of another local-history buff, Hoppy has self-published three books. The latest, ""Just Call Me Hoppy,"" chronicles his memories of a pre-toxic Picher, a time he believes everyone else has forgotten. The book begins in 1925, when the mines were at their peak -- and the year Hoppy was born. At 17, he left Picher to fight in World War II. After he was injured when his Navy ship was hit by a suicide bomber, Hoppy returned home to finish high school and go to work in the mines. In those years, Picher was a bustling town with neon signs ""like Las Vegas,"" Hoppy recalled.  See photos of the town » . When the mines slowed down and money was tight, Hoppy hustled billiard tables at a pool hall downtown. When the mines shut entirely, he bought the pool hall and hung on its walls some of his dad's mining gear: a kerosene lamp, a helmet. The items puzzled kids who came into the Pastime Pool Hall. What were the mines like? they asked Hoppy. What did they mine for, anyway? Shocked by the younger generation's ignorance, Hoppy became a collector. He asked the kids to bring in mining memorabilia. In exchange, he'd let them shoot a few rounds of pool for free. ""I thought it was important that people ought to know what Picher's role was in two world wars,"" Hoppy said. ""Hell, to me, it was important. ... Without the mines here in Ottawa County [Oklahoma], those wars would've lasted a lot longer."" Hoppy's book details Picher's patriotic spirit, its sense of purpose during the wars. But it mentions the Superfund buyout only in passing and never explains that the town is toxic. It doesn't say that four of Hoppy's great-grandchildren tested for high levels of lead in their blood. They are among the victims of Picher's toxic legacy. Hoppy figures the world hears plenty about all that. He'd rather focus on the Picher he loves. The walls of his pool hall -- the sign in the window says ""Hoppy's Museum"" -- are now papered with photos and artifacts. Neighboring buildings are boarded up, their windows broken, the paint peeling. Tree-size weeds crack the sidewalks. Hoppy's pool hall breathes life into this abandoned place, where only a few people still live. On Monday nights, he opens the doors to local musicians. When he goes home, he leaves a single bulb lit over the door. It's the only light on the street. * * * * * . One morning, about two weeks before Picher's June 13 reunion, Hoppy's son moved his dad out of town while Hoppy was at his favorite restaurant eating breakfast. Hoppy was furious. ""I unlocked the door ... and I didn't have a stick of furniture,"" he said. He stood in the entryway in disbelief. David Ray showed up behind his dad, bearing the news that Picher had left him behind. It was time to go. He was moving to Miami, a town just 10 miles south. Hoppy remains bewildered by the situation. He lies awake at night in his new home. He tunes the television to a country-music station and blares familiar songs to try to lull himself to sleep. On the rare instances when that has worked, Hoppy has dreamed of a pre-toxic Picher. He sees packed movie theaters and bar fights. He sees the people from the photos on the walls of his pool hall, all of whom are gone. Some mornings, Hoppy leaves breakfast and drives to his old home instead of his new one in Miami, as if he's on autopilot. His house in Picher, the one where he lived for nearly half a century, is tagged with yellow spray paint: TBCD. To be condemned. Why is moving just 10 miles away so devastating? Outside Picher, the mining town's former residents are branded ""lead heads"" and ""chat rats."" People wonder whether living in the polluted area made them stupid. Like any downtrodden group, Picher residents once found strength in numbers, in their insulated community. Now they must find their way in a larger world -- a world they don't fully understand, one that understands them only as the products of a toxic town. It's no wonder they seek solace in memories. * * * * * . From his post in the hallway at Picher's wake, Hoppy sold $300 worth of books -- not enough to cover costs but enough to leave him satisfied. His night was cut short when the muscles in his chest seized up. He had two heart attacks in recent weeks, and doctors said the stress was getting to him.

"Washington (CNN) -- President Obama's senior economic adviser said Sunday the government was delaying a report to Congress in order to provide more time to address China's alleged currency manipulation. Lawrence Summers, director of the National Economic Council, told the CNN program ""State of the Union"" that major international meetings coming up, including a G-20 economic gathering that will include China, provide the opportunity to resolve trade differences that could be exacerbated if the exchange-rate report were released on April 15 as scheduled. Summers said the upcoming meetings offer opportunities to engage China and other countries that have large trade surpluses with the United States. U.S Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner announced the delay of the report to Congress on Saturday. Many lawmakers had hoped the report would publicly admonish China for allegedly manipulating its currency to the detriment of the United States. Geithner, explaining the delay, said the upcoming meetings are ""the best avenue for advancing U.S. interests at this time."" On Sunday, Summers denied that the delayed report had any connection to the U.S. desire for China to support tougher sanctions against Iran over the Tehran government's refusal to comply with international regulations regarding its nuclear energy program. His comment was in response to a question on the ABC program ""This Week."" China has opposed more sanctions, but last week signaled a willingness to negotiate the issue within the U.N. Security Council, according to Susan Rice, the U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations. Lawmakers from both parties have called on the Obama administration to speak out against China's refusal to let its currency appreciate. China has kept its yuan at about 6.83 to the dollar for almost two years. Many U.S. economists say the currency is undervalued by as much as 40 percent. Keeping its currency low makes China's goods cheaper on the world market and more likely to be purchased by other countries. But, analysts say, it hurts American businesses, which cannot compete. Some analysts have argued that this is costing the United States 1.5 million jobs and impeding the country's economic recovery. ""Everyone knows China is manipulating the value of its currency to gain an unfair advantage in international trade,"" said Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, adding he was disappointed in the treasury secretary's decision. ""If we want the Chinese to take us seriously, we need to be willing to say so in public,"" said Grassley, the ranking Republican member of the Senate Finance Committee. ""The past few years have proven that denying the problem doesn't solve anything."" Chinese officials have insisted the United States is using Beijing as a scapegoat for its own economic problems. ""The Chinese government will not succumb to foreign pressure to adjust our exchange rates,"" said Zhong Shan, vice minister of commerce, late last month. Premier Wen Jiabao has been equally stern in his response. ""We oppose the practice of finger-pointing among countries or strong-arm measures to force other countries to appreciate currencies,"" he told reporters last month. In his statement, Geithner acknowledged China has maintained an ""inflexible exchange rate."" ""A move by China to a more market-oriented exchange rate will make an essential contribution to global rebalancing,"" he said. Rep. Sander Levin, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, said the delay was meant to see if the international community can address the issue in the coming months. ""If the multilateral effort does not result in China's making significant changes, the administration and Congress will have no choice but to take appropriate action,"" said Levin, a Democratic lawmaker from Michigan.","Economic adviser Lawrence Summers wants to give China more time .

"(CNN) -- A judge ordered an ex-aide to former Sen. John Edwards on Friday to turn over a sex tape said to depict Edwards and his former mistress, an official in a North Carolina court said. Judge Abraham Penn Jones found former Edwards aide Andrew Young and his wife, Cheri, in civil contempt of court, said Tammy Keshler, a judicial assistant in Chatham County Superior Court. He ordered them to give the court the tape and other materials they may have by 2 p.m. Wednesday, she said. The judge said he could jail the Youngs if they do not comply, she said. The Youngs appeared in court in Pittsboro, about 35 miles west of Raleigh, North Carolina, to contest a temporary restraining order forbidding them from disseminating the videotape. The couple has said they possess ""a video recording showing Senator Edwards engaged in sexual activities with a woman who, from all indications, is not his wife and who the Youngs believe to be Ms. Hunter, based upon her appearance,"" court documents say. The woman on the tape is visibly pregnant, the Youngs say. That means the video might not be the one specified in the restraining order, because Rielle Hunter, Edwards' former mistress, said that tape was created in September 2006, the Youngs say. ""This means that, as a matter of human biology, Ms. Hunter would have given birth no later than June 2007,"" the Youngs say. Hunter was pregnant in 2007 and gave birth to Edwards' daughter Frances Quinn on February 27, 2008. In the court documents, the Youngs suggest that Hunter might have mistaken when the video was made. Even if that is the case, they say, Hunter abandoned the videotape in the trash at their home and made no effort to recover it until almost two years after she had left their home. Friday's court proceeding is the latest development in a saga involving one-time Democratic presidential hopeful Edwards. In January, he admitted that he had fathered a child with Hunter, a videographer who worked on his campaign. Edwards, 56, had publicly denied paternity for more than a year. About a week after his admission, Edwards confirmed reports that he had legally separated from his wife, Elizabeth. Those announcements came just before Andrew Young released an embarrassing book about the Edwardses and his campaign. In the book, Young portrays John Edwards as a cold, calculating and reckless politician willing to deny fathering a girl, risk his marriage and put the Democratic Party in potential political jeopardy, all in the name of pursuing the presidency. After Hunter became pregnant, Young says in the book, he agreed to the North Carolina senator's request to lie, allowed Hunter to live in his home and said he was the father, though Young was married with three children.","NEW: Senator's former aide has until 2 p.m. to turn over video .

"(CNN)  -- It's a trip that would make Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher blush. On Friday, the Carnival cruise ship Elation, sponsored by the world's largest nonprofit singles travel group, will make history by hosting the world's first International Cougar Cruise, and we don't mean the animal. Defined by the Urban Dictionary, a cougar is ""an older woman who frequents clubs in order to score with a much younger man."" It can be anyone from ""an overly surgically altered wind tunnel victim, to an absolute sad and bloated old horn-meister."" ""A cougar is generally known as a woman over 40 who likes to date younger men, but theoretically any woman who dates younger men is a cougar,"" said Rich Gosse, who came up with the cougar cruise idea. The ship, which sets sail from San Diego, California, to Ensenada, Mexico, for three nights, is booked for 300 guests and even has a waiting list. The ship has three swimming pools, a seven-deck-high atrium, bar and grill, a Moroccan-inspired Casablanca Casino and a lounge that features stage shows, according to Ann Thomas, owner of the Singles Travel Company and organizer of the Cougar Cruise. After making port in Ensenada, the cruise offers extracurricular activities like horseback riding, ATVing and other outdoor excursions. ""There's at least four or five options a day for people to get together on the cruise. We're doing lots of activities; dancing, dining, Jacuzzi parties, karaoke for two hours. And starting at $125 a ticket, it's a great price,"" Thomas said. ""I've had to hire two more people part-time just to pick up the phones,"" she said. ""I've never seen a response quite like this."" Thomas admits that she was hesitant to sign on to the idea but is glad she did. ""We have people flying in from Italy and Denmark. My associates have been booking from France, Canada. It's fascinating,"" Thomas said. Gosse, who has been hosting singles events for more than 30 years, said he got the idea after hosting a cougar convention in Palo Alto, California. ""We had to turn away hundreds of people,"" Gosse said. ""Then we did one in Beverly Hills and had a massive crowd down there, so I thought, maybe we should do a cougar cruise. I didn't think anyone would want to go. Needless to say, the phone is ringing off the hook."" These cougars may as well be an endangered species compared with those hunting them on this cruise. ""The basic problem is, we have is too many cubs,"" Gosse said. ""We usually have too many women and not enough guys, but there's been a paradigm shift in recent years, so now the cubs are more excited about it than the cougars."" A ""cub"" is someone in their 20s or early 30s who likes to date older women, according to Gosse. For years, he says, it's been socially acceptable for older men to date younger women. But in recent years, a phenomenon sparked by celebrities like Kutcher, baseball player Alex Rodriguez (who is said to have dated pop star Madonna) and others has led a new generation of younger men on the prowl for more experienced partners. There is even an ABC sitcom called ""Cougar Town"" that glamorizes the sexual escapades of a 40-something divorcee on a search for self-discovery by dating younger men. ""Tim Robbins [and] Susan Sarandon was the first high-profile cougar-cub relationship,"" Gosse said of the actors, who have been together since the late 1980s. ""Now we're seeing a paradigm shift where these younger guys are actively looking for older women."" ""If you look at the demographics, the only logical way for people to get their needs met is for younger men to date older women,"" he said. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, for every 100 single women in their 20s in America, there are 118 single men in their 20s. The reason, Gosse said, is that young women are dating older guys. ""When you're single, you always wish the person meets someone they want to be with. If this is something they want, then I wish them well,"" Thomas said.","Cruise for women who date younger men sets sail on Carnival cruise ship Elation .

"(CNN) -- Charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested during martial law in the southern Philippines -- declared in the aftermath of last month's massacre of 57 civilians, the nation's justice secretary said. Justice Secretary Agnes Devanadera made the statement Saturday as the administration of President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo defended the martial law declaration, CNN affiliate ABS-CBN reported. Some lawmakers have challenged the legality of the declaration, which allows authorities to make arrests without a warrant. Martial law went into effect Friday night in the province of Maguindanao to impose peace following the politically motivated massacre, said army spokesman Lt. Col. Romeo Brawner Jr. He added that Congress would have to approve any extension beyond 60 days. Police and military reports of armed men massing in Maguindanao would lead to charges of rebellion, Devanadera said, according to ABS-CBN. Signs indicated that ""violence was imminent,"" said Brig. Gen. Gaudencio Pangilinan, operations chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines, the affiliate reported. The armed men were supporters of the politically powerful Ampatuan family, which has been implicated in the massacre, Pangilinan said. At least six members of the Ampatuan family have been arrested, including Datu Unsay Mayor Andal Ampatuan Jr., according to ABS-CBN. Ampatuan, whose father is governor of Maguindanao, has been accused of directing the killings and has been charged with 25 counts of murder. One of the massacre victims implicated members of the Ampatuan family before she died, the affiliate reported. Over the weekend, authorities raided at least one warehouse and ranch belonging to the family. They confiscated firearms, ammunition and vehicles, Maj. Randolph Cabangbang, deputy of operations for the eastern Mindinao command, told CNN. The military was looking at arresting at least 100 people tied to the massacre, ABS-CBN reported. The Philippine military is investigating its own forces in connection with the case as well, Brawner said. Asked why martial law was imposed 12 days after the killings, Cabangbang said authorities ""were trying to build a case, a tight case"" against suspects. ""But it is taking long to build a case, so I think the government gave us a free hand in arresting those who are suspects, and allowed us to search, even without warrant. So we really need this declaration of state of martial law."" The president was to submit a written report to Congress on Sunday evening, justifying her declaration of martial law, the Department of Justice said, according to the state-run Philippine News Agency. Political debate had flared over how soon Congress needed to convene after the declaration of martial law, as required by the Constitution. The House of Representatives and the Senate might jointly convene on Tuesday to discuss the president's report, House Speaker Prospero Nograles said Sunday, according to the Philippine News Agency. Violence in the run-up to elections is not uncommon in the country. The Maguindanao massacre, however, is the worst politically motivated violence in recent Philippine history, according to state media. The victims included the wife and sister of political candidate Ismael ""Toto"" Mangudadatu, who had sent the women to file paperwork allowing him to run for governor of Maguindanao. He said he had received threats from allies of Gov. Andal Ampatuan Sr., the father of the accused mayor, saying he would be kidnapped if he filed the papers himself. Ampatuan Sr. has been taken into custody in the massacre, but was hospitalized after taking ill. Witnesses and local officials say the killings were an attempt to block Mangudadatu from challenging the younger Ampatuan -- a longtime ally of the Philippine president and a known warlord -- in the May gubernatorial election. A dozen journalists who had accompanied the women were also killed in the massacre. Group: Philippines most dangerous country for journalists . Suspicion fell on Ampatuan after a government construction vehicle was found at the hastily dug mass grave that held the bodies of the massacre victims. Maguindanao is part of an autonomous region in predominantly Muslim Mindanao, which was set up in the 1990s to quell armed uprisings by people seeking an independent Muslim homeland in the predominantly Christian Asian nation.","NEW: Charges of rebellion will be leveled against many of those arrested during martial law .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- After the Republicans and Democrats met at the White House summit on health care, it was clear that the parties are very far away from a bipartisan agreement. Indeed, few participants walked away with the sense that they were any closer to a deal. The White House did make clear that it was willing to move forward on health care without Republican support. The choice now becomes whether Democrats should use the budget reconciliation process to pass some parts of health care legislation. According to recent reports, Democrats are considering having the House pass the bill that was already approved in the Senate and then dealing with a package of additional reforms through reconciliation. Programs that are considered under the reconciliation process are not subject to a Senate filibuster. Democrats would only need 51 votes, not 60, to pass those parts of the bill that are included under reconciliation. Reconciliation was created through the Budget Reform Act of 1974 in an effort to streamline the budget process, strengthen the ability of Congress to make tough decisions regarding deficits, and to make legislative decision-making more efficient. Congress quickly expanded on the types of measures that could be considered under reconciliation until 1985 and 1986, when the Senate passed rules proposed by Sen. Robert Byrd that limited what could or could not be included when using this process. Before moving forward, Democrats must consider two questions. The first is whether using reconciliation to pass health care is legitimate or an abuse of the process. Republicans have charged that this would be akin to forcing the program through the chamber rather than passing the bill through negotiation and compromise. On this question, the answer is easy. Reconciliation has been as much a part of the Senate in the past three decades as the filibuster. According to an article that was published in The New Republic, Congress passed 22 reconciliation bills between 1980 and 2008. Many important policy changes were enacted through this process, including the Children's Health Insurance Program, COBRA (which allows people who switch jobs to keep their health care), student aid reform, expansions in Medicaid and several major tax cuts. NPR's Julie Rovner reported that most of the health care reforms enacted in the past two decades have gone through reconciliation. President Ronald Reagan was one of the first presidents to make aggressive use of reconciliation when he pushed through his economic program in 1981. Senate Majority Leader Howard Baker said then that speed had been essential because ""Every day that this is delayed makes it more difficult to pass. This is an extraordinary proposal, and these are extraordinary times."" Presidents Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush all used reconciliation as well. It is worth noting that these presidents, particularly George W. Bush, also made use of sweeping executive power to circumvent Congress altogether. The second question is more difficult and it involves perceptions. If the Democratic leadership wants to use this tactic, they have to convince enough members of their own party that this won't scare off independent voters. This argument was harder to make in 2009 than in 2010. But after a year of dealing with paralysis in the Senate and highly effective Republican obstruction, more Democrats are coming on board. The leadership must be proactive in responding to the criticism about reconciliation. They will have to explain that reconciliation is a legitimate process by pointing to the history. They will also have to connect the dots for voters frustrated with the ineffective government by explaining that the constant use of the filibuster has turned the Senate into a supermajority institution where both parties have found it extraordinarily difficult -- virtually impossible -- to pass major legislation.On this point, Republicans and Democrats actually agree. Indeed, as Democrats make this decision, Kentucky Republican Senator Jim Bunning is objecting to a unanimous consent order and single-handedly preventing the Senate from passing an important bill to assist unemployed workers. Democrats must also convince hesitant colleagues that the payoff could be greater than the cost. While, in the short-term, Republicans will complain that their opponents have rammed through social policy in some sort of unnatural procedural move, Democrats are facing these kinds of intense attacks anyway. Right now, Democrats are receiving the brunt of Republican attacks without being able to pass much legislation. If they pass health care, they will be able to respond to the arguments of the GOP, not just by complaining that Republicans obstruct everything, but by pointing to specific benefits such as lowering premiums by expanding how many people purchase coverage and bringing tens of millions of Americans into the health care system. In certain respects, the White House made the use of reconciliation more difficult by initially accepting the notion that 60 votes were needed to pass legislation through the Senate. After the election of Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, a decision to refocus on procedures that only depend on 51 votes makes it more vulnerable to the attacks of manipulating the process. But in other respects, the administration now has a better political opportunity to use reconciliation. After a year, the public has seen just how dysfunctional Senate procedures can be in an era when filibusters are common. With a public that is frustrated by Washington, as the polls show, the Democrats might be able to persuade a sufficient number of their colleagues to go along. If they don't, one thing is for certain: Democrats will go into election day facing voters who are hearing all the complaints about their party but seeing very little in terms of what they can deliver on health care. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Democrats are considering using method to pass health bill with 50, not 60 Senate votes .

"(CNN) -- Dozens of tips have poured in after California authorities released more than 100 photos of women and children on Thursday that are believed to have been taken by a serial killer who appeared on the ""Dating Game."" Police determined Friday that two female minors in the pictures, taken in the 1970s, are alive and well. They have received tips on a handful of other women who could be dead or missing, according to Patrick Ellis, a detective with the Huntington Beach Police Department. ""We've received several calls saying that someone in a photo could be so-and-so who's been missing or found dead,"" Ellis said Friday. ""The response has been overwhelming, and that's what we were looking for."" Investigators are trying to determine whether any of the people in the photos were victims of Rodney Alcala, 66, who was convicted in February of kidnapping and murdering a 12-year-old girl and raping and murdering four Los Angeles County women in the 1970s. A jury this week recommended he be sentenced to death. Ellis said police received tips on as many as four dead or missing women who were identified by other people calling and e-mailing about the photos. ""People are saying that they recognize someone from their past, from school or college or the neighborhood beach,"" he said. The two women who identified themselves from the photos on Friday were minors at the time the pictures were taken and are now in their 40s, Ellis said. Police are not releasing their identities, though Ellis said they live in California. Nancy Grace blog: See the photos . Huntington Beach Police are contacting law enforcement authorities across the country with information about dead or missing women who were identified by people calling or e-mailing on Friday, Ellis said. He stressed that police have not confirmed that any of the women or children in the photos are dead or missing. The portrait-style photographs were discovered in a storage unit Alcala kept in Seattle, Washington, said Orange County district attorney spokeswoman Susan Kang Schroeder. The locker also contained earrings that belonged to Robin Samsoe, the 12-year-old girl whom Alcala abducted and killed in 1979. The discovery of the earring in the locker has raised speculation that there may be other victims or that the photographs were trophies to Alcala, she said. ""We know that Mr. Alcala used his photography as a ruse to get close to his victims,"" she said. Authorities already believe that Alcala may be responsible for deaths in New York, Schroeder said. ""It's very possible,"" Schroeder said. ""Mr. Alcala is a predatory monster and we believe that he destroyed many lives everywhere he went."" Alcala was convicted in 1972 of kidnapping and molesting a child in Los Angeles County in 1968, according to the Orange County District Attorney's office. After serving a 34-month sentence, he was released. In 1978, Alcala appeared as a ""Bachelor No. 1"" on ""The Dating Game."" Jed Mills, who played ""Bachelor No. 2,"" said he had an almost immediate aversion to Alcala. ""Something about him, I could not be near him,"" Mills recalled. ""I am kind of bending toward the other guy to get away from him, and I don't know if I did that consciously. But thinking back on that, I probably did."" But Alcala succeeded in charming Bachelorette Cheryl Bradshaw from the other side of the ""Dating Game"" wall. But she declined her date with Alcala. Anyone with information regarding the identities of the women and children in the photographs found in Alcala's storage locker is asked to contact the Orange County District Attorney's Office or the Huntington Beach Police Department.

"(CNN) -- She lived the life of a little girl's dream. From the time she visited SeaWorld as a 9-year-old, Dawn Brancheau was hooked. From then on, her family said, she was determined to be an animal trainer when she grew up. ""It was her dream job,"" Brancheau's sister, Diane Gross, said Thursday. ""And our family got to ride along with her in her dream."" But on Wednesday, Brancheau, 40, died at the Orlando, Florida, park after a killer whale named Tilikum -- a whale she trained and cared for -- grabbed her ponytail and dragged her underwater in front of stunned onlookers. The Orange County medical examiner determined that she probably died from ""multiple traumatic injuries and drowning,"" the Orange County Sheriff's Office said Thursday. ""She loved the animals like they were her own children,"" Gross said. ""She went to work every day. She loved what she did."" Brancheau was the youngest of six children, born in Cedar Lake, Indiana. She attended Andrean High, a small Catholic school in Merrillville, Indiana, where she was a cheerleader, on the golf and track teams, and student council president. ""She was so involved with the different clubs. She was the homecoming queen, the prom queen; she was pretty much everything,"" said Dave Pishkur, the school's alumni director. Pishkur said Brancheau always talked about working with animals one day, and when she returned to Merrillville in 2007 for her 20th high school reunion, he remembers her being very attached to her whales. ""When we asked her if she had kids, she said, 'I don't have time for a family now. My kids are my whales,' "" Pishkur recalled. ""It's devastating to think about what occurred,"" he added. Brancheau had worked at SeaWorld for 17 years, according to a SeaWorld spokeswoman Leigh Andrus. ""She was one of our most experienced killer whale trainers,"" Andrus said. Gross said her sister ""loved her whales. She loved her family, and she will be dearly missed. She was a wonderful sister and daughter and aunt to many nieces and nephews."" She also leaves behind a husband, Scott. In a 2000 interview with CNN affiliate WESH-TV, Brancheau talked about the need to stay physically fit in order to deal with the physical exertion needed to work with the orca whales. She said she ran marathons, cycled and lifted weights to stay in the best condition possible. ""You want to prevent any injury and stay in great physical fitness so you can stay strong out there in the water with the animals,"" she said. ""Anything to keep you in shape for what we're doing out there."" She also said trainers have to get to know the animals' behavior. ""We work with them day in and out, teaching them basic things as well as the more complicated moves that you see."" SeaWorld has halted killer whale shows in all of its parks -- in Orlando; San Antonio, Texas; and San Diego, California -- until it can evaluate its safety protocols to provide the safest environment for its trainers. ""We will not move forward until that can happen with the trainers,"" Chuck Tompkins, SeaWorld's curator for zoological operations, said on CNN's ""American Morning."" ""And out of respect for Dawn and her family, we want to take time to respect her, and that's why currently we are not doing shows at SeaWorld, and we need to assure ourselves that we have the safest environment,"" he said. Dealing with a wild animal carries inherent risks. Tilikum has been linked to two other deaths. He and two other whales were involved in the drowning of a trainer at a Victoria, British Columbia, marine park in 1991. The trainer fell into the whale tank at the Sea Land Marine Park Victoria and was dragged underwater as park visitors watched. In 1999, Tilikum was blamed for the death of a 27-year-old man whose body was found floating in a tank at SeaWorld. Tompkins said that because of Tilikum's size and his history, trainers did not get into the water with him. iReport: Photo shot moments before Sea World incident . No funeral arrangements for Dawn Brancheau have been announced. Her family must now deal with the shock and sadness of losing their wife, sister and friend, who had lived a little girl's dream.

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Her braids, dusty from the rubble around her, poked out from the small opening where she lay crying in pain, her right leg pinned under a heavy piece of metal. A group of men worked throughout the day to free this 11-year-old girl -- one of scores trapped beneath buildings that collapsed in Tuesday's 7.0-magnitude quake. Lacking proper supplies to cut through the metal crushing the child's leg, the men briefly considered amputating it. Finally, just after sunset Thursday, a miracle of sorts: an electric saw and a small generator. Within a couple of hours, the girl was freed and rushed to a first aid station. Her leg was so badly wounded, her family was taking her to a more sophisticated hospital some three hours outside of Port-au-Prince. Many rescuers have clawed their way to survivors pinned beneath buildings two days after the devastating earthquake. In the absence of heavy machinery to clear the debris, residents used their hands and brawn to lift large slabs of concrete. Some trapped victims punched out bricks themselves and tried to squeeze through cracks in the fallen structures. Atop the mound of debris that once was a five-story building of great prominence, U.S. rescue workers Thursday pulled out a man in a deep green uniform. Tarmo Joveer, an Estonian security officer for the United Nations, free from the enclosure, stood up and raised his fist. He had been trapped beneath the rubble of his workplace for two days following the quake that shook the city and toppled the U.N. headquarters around him. He said he had never lost hope. He was one of scores of U.N. workers feared trapped inside the headquarters of the U.N. peacekeeping and civilian assistance mission, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon said Thursday. As many as 150 staff members were still missing after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake rocked Haiti Tuesday afternoon, devastating it's capital. The ""small miracle,"" as Ban described it, is one of many throughout the disaster area as rescuers and residents scramble to free entrapped survivors. The Fairfax County, Virginia, Urban Search and Rescue Team saved Joveer, who was fed water through a rubber pipe when they discovered he was trapped beneath four meters of rubble, according to Ban. After Joveer emerged, he walked away, brushing the dust out of his hair with his hand and hugging those around him. ""It was not good,"" is all he could say to describe his experience under the rubble. He also said he did not think there was anyone else alive. Joveer was later taken to an Argentinean hospital, Ban said. Joveer said during the earthquake he lost his footing, fell and suffered some pain. He did not talk further about any injuries he may have sustained. It took about five hours to rescue Joveer, Fairfax rescue member Sam Gray said, adding that the disaster was the worst he'd seen. ""Obviously, it was pretty nice to find somebody that we were able to help,"" Gray said. ""Unfortunately, we couldn't get to everybody but we're going to keep trying and keep working while we're here. This is the first of many people that we're going to help over the next couple of weeks."" Earlier Thursday, residents conducted their own mission and spent three hours digging out Philip Jean Renol from his home. He suffered a broken leg and two broken arms. At a school house, a group of men had been working since Wednesday to dig out a man from beneath what was left of the five-story building. They worked in assembly-line fashion with some tapping away with chisels and one operating a blow torch to melt away parts of the concrete debris crushing the victim. With his right shoulder pinned and his hand trapped, his screams could be heard as the men desperately labored to free him. Finally, he emerged from beneath the destroyed school alive when two men lifted his concrete-dusted body Thursday. From inside the school other voices were heard. Children and teachers are believed to be trapped inside. Throughout the day, ongoing rescue attempts were taking place all over Port-au-Prince, many with outcomes as yet unknown. A search-and-rescue crew of American, Chilean and French members found a woman trapped at the Hotel Montana in Petionville, just outside Port-au-Prince. Officer David Barlow of the Fairfax team told CNN the crew was trying to reach the woman from two different points. The victim, who was a guest at the hotel, was stuck in the bar area of the five-story hotel that had collapsed into a 30-foot-tall pile. France has expressed concern for the approximately 200 French tourists who were staying at the Hotel Montana. Three French girls trapped in rubble had only one French firefighter digging for them, reflective of a severe need for rescue workers and equipment. In another location in Port-au-Prince, two people were pulled from the ruins of the Caribbean Market by the Icelandic International Search and Rescue Team, Iceland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced. But another woman, Nadia, was still entombed inside the four-level market place. She has not had water for almost 48 hours and has told rescuers she feels tired. Rescuers said they had yet to devise a plan to extract her safely. Near the presidential palace, residents dug for hours Wednesday to rescue a 13-year-old girl named Bea. A wild cheer erupted as she was pulled out alive. But nearby lay the bodies of four of her family members. Haitians and rescuers are rushing in the hope that more survivors can be pulled out alive from beneath the multitude of wreckage sites, but some have accepted that some will perish waiting for help. ""Honestly, it's an incredible amount of devastation and an incredible amount of people that will probably lose their lives here,"" Gray said. ""The hardest part is to know how many people that aren't going to be saved.""

"(CNN)  -- The family of a Korean-American missionary believed held in North Korea said Tuesday they are working with U.S. officials to get him returned home. Robert Park told relatives before Christmas that he was trying to sneak into the isolated communist state to bring a message of ""Christ's love and forgiveness"" to North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. In a written statement issued Tuesday on the family's behalf, his brother, Paul Park, said Park's well-being ""has been a source of ongoing concern and anxiety"" since they received reports he had entered North Korea. ""He is a very special member of our family. We miss having his love and compassion in our home,"" the family statement said. ""I don't know where he's being held, but if he can receive this message, we want him to know we love him, we miss him and we are waiting anxiously for the opportunity to be reunited with him."" Paul Park said his San Diego, California-area family is working with the U.S. State Department and members of Congress to bring about his ""eventual safe return."" North Korea announced Tuesday that it was holding an American who entered the country illegally from China on Christmas Eve. The state-run Korea Central News Agency did not identify the man, who it said was ""now under investigation by a relevant organ."" Monday, State Department spokesman Ian Kelly said Washington was concerned by reports that Park had gone into North Korea but could not confirm them. Washington and Pyongyang have no diplomatic relations, but Kelly said the Swedish Embassy -- which looks after U.S. interests in North Korea -- has offered to try to find out more. A South Korean Web site last week posted a copy of the letter it said Park was trying to deliver to Kim, which urged the North Korean leader in the name of Jesus Christ to free political prisoners and ""open your borders so that we may bring food, provisions, medicine, necessities, and assistance to those who are struggling to survive."" North Korean authorities take a dim view of people who enter the country without authorization. Two American journalists who were arrested along the North Korean-Chinese border in March faced a 12-year sentence at hard labor, but were released after a meeting between Kim and former U.S. President Bill Clinton in Pyongyang. But Park's parents told CNN affiliate KFMB that their son was willing to risk his life to deliver his message to Kim.","Korean-American missionary Robert Park is believed to be held in North Korea .

"(CNN) -- Colleen LaRose, the Pennsylvania woman indicted for allegedly conspiring to support terrorists and kill a person in a foreign country, attempted to commit suicide in 2005, according to a police report filed at the time. LaRose, who authorities say called herself ""Jihad Jane,"" was depressed about the death of her father, the report from Pennsburg, Pennsylvania, Police Officer Michael Devlin said. LaRose told Devlin she swallowed as many as 10 pills of cyclobenzaprine, a muscle relaxant. The pills were mixed with alcohol. ""Colleen was highly intoxicated and having difficulty maintaining her balance,"" Devlin wrote. I ""questioned LaRose about harming herself, at which point she stated she does not want to die."" Devlin was dispatched to check on LaRose in response to a 911 call made by LaRose's sister in Texas, who was worried LaRose might try to kill herself. LaRose was arrested on the terrorism charges in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on October 15, a spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office said Tuesday. She is being held at the Federal Detention Center in Philadelphia, according to the U.S. attorney's office. She will be arraigned at 10:30 a.m. March 18 in Philadelphia, the Justice Department said. Among other things, LaRose has also been charged with making false statements to a government official and attempted identity theft. If convicted, she faces a possible life prison sentence and a $1 million fine. Last year, LaRose agreed to kill a resident of Sweden, an indictment says, and a U.S. government official familiar with the case identified the target as Lars Vilks, a cartoonist who outraged some with a drawing of the Muslim Prophet Mohammed. LaRose worked with at least five co-conspirators, the indictment says. Authorities did not identify them, but police in Ireland took into custody seven people in arrests Tuesday that the U.S. official said were directly related to the plot involving LaRose. Read the indictment (PDF) Authorities in Ireland said the seven people they arrested also were plotting to commit a murder abroad. Irish media reports, citing unnamed police sources, identified their target as Vilks. A person from Pennsburg who knew LaRose said she ""didn't have the smarts or brains"" to pull off the alleged plot. ""Not without someone telling her what to do, maybe even brainwashing her,"" said the person, who asked not to be identified for privacy reasons. It appears that LaRose was not well known in her neighborhood in Pennsburg, which is about an hour north of Philadelphia. One neighbor reacted to the news by saying, ""It scares the hell out of me."" Meanwhile, LaRose's former boyfriend, Kurt Gorman, told CNN on Wednesday that the circumstances surrounding her arrest are ""just crazy ... really crazy."" Gorman said that when he lived with LaRose, she spent most of her time at home and frequently used a personal computer. ""I think she just used it to play games mostly,"" he said. ""I really didn't pay much attention."" The alleged terrorist conspiracy began in June 2008, when LaRose posted a comment on YouTube under the username JihadJane saying she was ""desperate to do something somehow to help"" Muslims, according to a federal indictment unsealed Tuesday. From December 2008 to October 2009, LaRose engaged in electronic communication with five alleged co-conspirators about their shared desires to wage jihad and become martyrs, according to the indictment. LaRose and the alleged co-conspirators, according to a Justice Department statement, used the Internet to develop plans that ""included martyring themselves, soliciting funds for terrorists, soliciting passports and avoiding travel restrictions (through the collection of passports and through marriage) in order to wage violent jihad."" According to the U.S. government official familiar with the case, LaRose raised money for the cause and recruited people to join it. The official also said she was in contact with committed jihadists in South Asia, Western Europe and Eastern Europe. The official declined to link her to any specific terrorist organizations. 'Jihad Jane,' American who lived on Main Street . The indictment says that at one point, LaRose stole a U.S. passport to ""facilitate an act of international terrorism."" Gorman told CNN that after LaRose left him suddenly last August, he realized his passport was missing. He said he reported the lost document to the State Department. Several months later, he said, the FBI came to see him, and he told them what he knew about her. In November, he said, he testified in Philadelphia before a grand jury. The FBI told him she was already in custody then, Gorman said. ""I really don't know much,"" he said. LaRose had received ""a direct order to kill a citizen and resident of Sweden, and to do so in a way that would frighten 'the whole Kufar [nonbeliever] world,' "" according to the indictment. LaRose agreed to carry out the murder, according to the Justice Department statement. ""I will make this my goal till I achieve it or die trying,"" LaRose said via electronic communication, according to the indictment. In 2007, Vilks drew a cartoon of Mohammed with the body of a dog, prompting the al Qaeda terrorist network to offer $100,000 to anyone who killed him, plus an extra $50,000 if the killer slits his throat. Watch a profile of Vilks from 2007 . Irish police did not confirm that Vilks was the target, but responded to a CNN question about Vilks by saying the arrests were ""part of an investigation into a conspiracy to commit a serious offense, namely, conspiracy to murder an individual in another jurisdiction."" Irish police arrested four men and three women in Waterford and Cork, authorities said. They range in age from the mid-20s to late 40s. Ireland's national broadcaster, RTE, said the suspects are originally from Morocco and Yemen but are all living legally as refugees in Ireland. Irish police worked with counterparts in the United States and ""a number of European countries,"" they said. LaRose, along with the co-conspirators, believed that ""her appearance and American citizenship would help her blend in while carrying out her plans, calling it a possible ""way to achieve what is in my heart,"" according to the indictment. The indictment alleges that LaRose even agreed to marry one of the co-conspirators to obtain residency status in a European country. LaRose traveled to Europe in August 2009 and ""tracked the intended target online in an effort to complete her task,"" the Justice Department statement said. According to the indictment, LaRose told the co-conspirator who allegedly ordered the murder that she considers it an ""honour & a great pleasure to die or kill for"" the co-conspirator, and she pledged that ""only death will stop me here that I am so close to the target."" The killing did not occur, and LaRose was arrested about two weeks after the electronic message was sent. Mark Wilson, a federal public defender representing LaRose, declined to comment on the case Tuesday. The Justice Department said LaRose was born in 1963 and lives outside of Philadelphia in Montgomery County. Police records show she was arrested twice in 1997: once for driving while intoxicated and once for passing a bad check in the San Antonio, Texas, area. She moved from Texas to Pennsylvania in 2004.

"(CNN) -- The person responsible for a Virginia Tech student's death was familiar with the area where her body was recovered, police said Thursday. The farmland site where Morgan Harrington's remains were found is the ""most significant"" aspect of the investigation into her death, Virginia State Police Lt. Joe Rader said. He asked that members of the surrounding community call police with any details of the area and who has frequented it. ""People in North Garden, people in the Anchorage Farm area, you know what goes on there,"" Rader said, referring to areas of Virginia's Albemarle County. ""You know the history. You know who comes in and out of that vicinity. You may not realize it, but you probably have some information for us that you don't think is important."" Morgan Harrington disappeared October 17, after attending a Metallica concert at the University of Virginia's John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville, Virginia. The 20-year-old education major was separated from her friends at the concert. A farmer discovered her skeletal remains on his 700-acre farm January 26, police said. The farm is about 10 miles from the concert site. There have been no arrests in the case, police said. The cause of her death is still under investigation. Investigators think that the farm ""did not present an unnecessary risk for the person responsible"" and that the person passed through or visited the farm or the nearby area, Rader said. Traveling to the area where the remains were found ""would have created a significant risk for any person not familiar to that area and not comfortable with that type of setting,"" Rader said. ""Farmland like the place where Morgan's body was located has obstacles, difficult obstacles. It has streams, it has fences, it has defects, it has terrain that changes. That's important, that's a high-risk opportunity to pick that location to take Morgan Harrington unless you're familiar with the area,"" he said. ""We don't believe those are challenges that someone unfamiliar with the area would confront."" The farmer who found Harrington's remains came across them in a remote section of a hayfield, police said last month. The farm's owner, David Dass, told CNN affiliate WTVR that he was out looking for damage after wind and rain knocked down several trees in his yard when he found ""what looked like a human skull."" He told WTVR that the area is at least a mile and a half from a main roadway. Read more about the case from WTVR . ""There is no public access to this particular area. The hayfield was last cut in August 2009 and would have been possibly waist-high by mid-October 2009,"" a January police statement said. On the October night Harrington went missing, she had left her friends to use the restroom during the concert, police said. When she did not return, her friends called her cell phone at 8:48 p.m. She told them she was outside the arena and could not get back in because of its policy, police said, but she told them not to worry about her and she would find a ride home. There are restrooms inside the arena, police said, and authorities do not know how or why Harrington got outside. Witnesses who saw her outside the arena said she did not appear to be with anyone, police said. About 9:30 p.m., witnesses reported seeing a person matching Harrington's description walking on a nearby bridge, police said. No further sightings were reported. Harrington's purse, with her identification and cell phone inside, was found the following day in an overflow parking lot near the arena, police said. A friend had driven Harrington's car to the concert, she said, and still had the car keys when they became separated. Police are asking anyone with information on the case to call 434-709-1685. The family will hold a Mass for Harrington on Friday in Roanoke, Virginia. ""We are grief stricken by her death but also lifted by the knowledge that Morgan Dana Harrington was precious to so many and will not be forgotten,"" her family wrote Monday on their Web site dedicated to Harrington. ""She mattered, to us all.""","Person responsible for death said to be familiar with area where remains were found .

"London, England (CNN) -- The X-ray machine was Wednesday named the most important scientific invention, in a poll marking the centenary of the Science Museum in London. Almost 50,000 people voted in the museum or online on a shortlist of ten discoveries and inventions from past centuries in science, technology and engineering. The X-ray machine, which was discovered in 1895 and revolutionized how doctors detected disease and injury, struck a chord with most voters who singled it out for having made the greatest impact on the past, present and future. It gathered one fifth of the votes( 9581 votes) followed by the discoveries of penicillin and the DNA double helix structure. Katie Maggs, associate curator of medicine at the Science Museum, told CNN that she was ""pleasantly surprised"" with the results, saying she ""wondered whether the therapeutic benefit of penicillin might just edge in front -- or perhaps the Apollo 10 capsule as visitors find space travel so inspirational as the ultimate test of technology."" Maggs attributed the X-ray machine's popularity to the wide impact it has on people's everyday life, from the very first steps of a medical diagnosis to security control at airports. ""People are just fascinated with seeing inside their bodies --- even today. It has fundamentally changed the way we see and understand our world -- but particularly our bodies. ""But I also think visitors are aware of the immense and various benefits x-rays have brought -- revolutionizing medical diagnosis and therapy but also astronomy and material and chemical science -- it was x-rays that enabled us to discover the structure of DNA after all!"" X-rays were discovered in November 1895 by German physicist Wilhelm Röntgen. The Science Museum also houses the Reynolds machine, which was built by a father and son John and Russell Reynolds, months after Röntgen announced his discovery.  They were so inspired by the news that they started constructing the equipment in their own home.","The X-ray machine was voted the most significant scientific invention, in a poll by the Science Museum in London .

"Seattle, Washington (CNN) -- While dramatizing the against-the-odds rescue of a noble, harmonious alien society called the Na'vi, James Cameron's ""Avatar"" may also effectuate the rescue of a nasty, contentious alien society known as Hollywood -- or at least save Tinseltown's annual Oscar extravaganza from its long-term ratings slump. The annual Academy Awards telecast used to be one of the big, unifying cultural events that most Americans shared and talked about -- like the Super Bowl, or presidential election night, or Christmas Eve. As recently as the 1990's, more than 40 million U.S. viewers -- according to The Nielsen Company -- watched the broadcast in whole or in part, and spoke the next day about the best and worst gowns, the dumbest acceptance speeches, and the biggest surprises in the major categories. Beginning with the awards for the film year 2003, however, the ratings for Hollywood's big show took a sharp turn for the worse, dipping consistently below the 40 million figure (despite sharply increased population) and reaching an all-time low in 2008, according to Nielsen. The problem wasn't the quality of the hosts or the clumsiness of the big musical numbers, but the year-after-year nature of the top nominated films, with deeply depressing, art-house fare (""Million Dollar Baby,"" ""Crash"") reliably crowding out more popular releases. The infamous 2008 Oscar telecast experienced a crash all its own, with just 31.76 million viewers -- or barely one out of ten Americans, according to Nielsen. As The Hollywood Reporter observed, the collapse in the size of the audience had everything to do with the gloomy nature of the leading nominees, all of which scored high on ""the depression meter. ... 'Atonement,' 'Michael Clayton,' 'Juno,' 'No Country for Old Men,' and 'There Will Be Blood' were the bedsheet-noose best picture nominees."" The ratings last year rebounded slightly, with the relatively upbeat ""Slum Dog Millionaire"" delivering some old-fashioned uplift with its reassuringly familiar poor-boy-makes-good and love-conquers-all messages, despite the exotic (and sometimes brutal) Mumbai, India, settings. For this year's March 7 broadcast, however, industry insiders tell me they expect a spectacular increase in the size of the TV audience -- perhaps even surpassing the huge 1998 ratings that set a recent record: 55 million viewers, nearly twice the viewership for 2008, according to Nielsen. Sure, Billy Crystal's sprightly humor helped attract the hordes who viewed the '98 spectacle -- but the big attraction was a very big movie: ""Titanic,"" the ultimate winner of 11 Oscars and, at the time, the top grossing motion picture ever released. No wonder James Cameron proudly proclaimed himself ""king of the world"" while scooping up his gold baldie for Best Director. Well, 2010 will witness the ""Return of the King"" (you should pardon the expression), with ""Avatar"" replacing ""Titanic"" as history's top money-maker and listed as a heavy favorite for numerous Academy Awards (particularly in the technical arena). The Oscar telecast will get a huge boost from all the avid ""Avatar"" fanatics, many of whom have seen the movie over and over again. Popular favorite Sandra Bullock, odds-on favorite to win Best Actress (she's already won the Golden Globes, the Screen Actors Guild Awards and tied for the Critics Choice Awards) will draw additional viewers who made the heartwarming, faith-family-and-football saga ""The Blind Side"" one of last year's most successful surprises. Ironically, the presence of such populist fare on any list of sure-thing nominees makes the much-ballyhooed reform of the Best Picture category largely unnecessary when it comes to insuring a successful telecast. Instead of five nominees as in the past, this year the Academy selected 10 films as candidates for the top prize, hoping to guarantee at least a few popular box office winners to go along with the usual dark, despairing and little-seen indie offerings on the ever-popular theme of ""Life Sucks."" (Actually, Mel Brooks directed a 1991 film originally entitled ""Life Sucks,"" later released as ""Life Stinks,"" which won no Oscar nominations and garnered the worst box office returns of his long, distinguished career.) The good side of doubling the number of nominees involves increasing the chances for worthy films to get additional recognition, like the superb animated Disney/Pixar release ""Up,"" which was nominated for Best Picture. There is, however, a downside to the expansion of the Best Picture category: By swelling the number of nominees, the Academy contributes to the ongoing fragmentation of our culture. In recent years, only a handful of ferociously committed film buffs (and professional critics) could claim to have seen all five of the top nominees, and with ten choices now for the top prize, the number of moviegoers to have seen them all -- or even able to talk about them all -- will shrink even further. In a similar vein, the expansion of television into innumerable cable networks (way beyond the traditional big three broadcast operations) may have vastly expanded the number of worthy offerings, but greatly reduces the cultural impact of any one of them. ""Mad Men"" or ""The Sopranos"" may be great, but can't compare to the ability of old shows like ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Mash"" or ""The Cosby Show"" to bring Americans together for a few moments of entertainment across all demographic divisions. Because of ""Avatar's"" phenomenal popularity, it may look like this year's Oscar show will have recaptured that unifying potential; but once the Na'vi send the corporate invaders back to Earth and recede into movie history, the centrifugal force of too many choices and ever-multiplying niche audiences will kick in once more and dictate the further atomization of our civilization. Not even James Cameron can fight the long-term trend.  The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michael Medved.","Film critic Michael Medved: Expanded Oscar nominations fragment culture .

"(CNN) -- Football players are pushing for the sport's world governing body FIFA to bring in technology to decide whether the ball has crossed the goalline. In a poll by international players' union FIFpro, 90 percent of respondents said they wanted to see goalline technology introduced. FIFpro has submitted the findings to the International Football Association Board, FIFA's lawmaking body, which is meeting on Saturday, March 6, to discuss possible changes to the laws of the game. Tijs Tummers, secretary of FIFpro's technical committee, said players have had enough of games being blighted by incorrect decisions over goals. ""The ultimate aim of football is scoring goals, and there's no greater injustice than when you have scored and it's not allowed because they say it did not cross the line,"" Tummers told CNN. ""Every weekend you see a situation like this in one of the top European leagues. ""There are no buts. It's very simple. The only argument against is that you say we want to keep a human feel but in the opinion of FIFpro and the players that is nonsense."" German sportswear giant Adidas has been working on a form of technology involving a microchip in the ball, while other options include a version of the Hawk-Eye system of computerized cameras currently used in tennis. FIFA President Sepp Blatter has called for a system which is accurate but doesn't disrupt the flow of the game. FIFA has tested goalline technology in junior tournaments but has recently moved away from further trials in favor of a simpler system involving two extra assistant referees stationed at each end. The scheme, favored by UEFA President Michel Platini, has been tested in the Europa League this season but has proved unpopular with coaches and players. FIFpro polled the 48 captains who have played in the Europa League this season, with 70 percent of the 31 who responded saying they saw no improvement in decision-making. The row between extra referees and technology is on the agenda for the IFAB meeting, with any changes to be implemented next season, after the World Cup. Other issues under review include whether players who concede penalties through professional fouls should also be sent off, and whether players should continue to be allowed to feint their run-ups when taking penalties.","Football players lobby FIFA to introduce goalline technology .

"(CNN) -- He's been decorated with awards and called one of the world's most influential people. He's addressed packed auditoriums and waved to crowds who line streets just to catch a passing glimpse of him. He's shaken the hands of countless global dignitaries and earned a fan base following on Facebook that might rival that of Hollywood stars. He is His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, the 74-year-old spiritual leader of Tibet and the head of the Tibetan government-in-exile, based in Dharamsala, India. And though he describes himself, according to his Web site, as ""a simple Buddhist monk,"" the love so many Americans and others have for him has, no doubt, bestowed on him iconic status -- whether he sees it that way or not. ""I'd love to be in his presence. I'd love to be in an audience where he speaks,"" said Jerilee Auclair, 55, of Vancouver, Washington, who has yet to have that pleasure. ""I yearn for it. I watch his schedule to see if/when he'll be in my area. ... I love what he stands for. His inner peace inspires me to find mine, daily."" She's far from alone in her admiration. A CNN/Opinion Research Corp. survey released Thursday, the same day the Dalai Lama visited the White House, showed that 56 percent of Americans hold a favorable view of him, putting him ""in the same neighborhood as other major religious figures,"" said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. ""Favorable ratings for the pope, at 59 percent, and Billy Graham, at 57 percent, are virtually identical."" Not bad for a guy who lives on the opposite side of the globe, is entrenched in a decades-old political and cultural struggle many don't understand, and lives according to a tradition few Americans follow. Less than 1 percent of Americans identify themselves as Buddhist, with less than 0.3 percent of those being Tibetan Buddhist, according to The Pew Forum on Religion & Public Life. But what he represents resonates with Americans who may need a figure like the Dalai Lama to look to, said Ganden Thurman, executive director of New York City's Tibet House, an organization dedicated to preserving Tibetan culture and civilization. ""He stands for achieving peace by way of peace, and since Gandhi and Martin Luther King aren't around, he's a placeholder for that kind of position,"" he said. ""He says he's a 'simple monk,' but that's wishful thinking. He's a monk that's been saddled with the responsibility of shouldering the hopes and dreams of millions of Tibetan people. ... He's doing the best he can with that, and frankly, these are the kind of people we admire."" Not that Thurman, 42, always treated the Dalai Lama with this kind of reverence. His father, Robert Thurman, co-founded the Tibet House, is an Indo-Tibetan Buddhist studies professor at Columbia University and holds the first endowed chair in Buddhist studies in the West, according to the university's online biography. The older Thurman, who also happens to be the father of actress Uma Thurman, was a personal student of the Dalai Lama, and it was through this relationship that his son first met the spiritual leader. ""My earliest memory of meeting him, I was around 4. I was a pretty rambunctious 4-year-old,"" he said with a laugh, guessing that he probably jumped on His Holiness and grabbed at the man's glasses. ""Diplomatic protocol wasn't high on my list of priorities."" Tenzin Tethong has known the Dalai Lama since he was a child. He worked in the exile government and served as the spiritual leader's representative in New York and Washington during the 1970s and 1980s. Now the president of The Dalai Lama Foundation, a Redwood City, California, organization that promotes peace, Tethong said he organized the Tibetan leader's first visit to the United States in 1979, 20 years after he had gone into exile . He recalled not being sure they'd be able to pull off the visit because by the early 1970s, the U.S. had normalized its relations with China, which has long viewed the Dalai Lama as a threat to its national unity on the issue of Tibetan autonomy. But they came at the invitation of various colleges and religious groups, and the American fascination with the Dalai Lama -- the curiosity about his exotic past, his beliefs and his teachings -- spoke volumes then, Tethong said. In the decades since, the Dalai Lama's star power has only risen as Americans have learned more about his commitment to nonviolence, interfaith outreach and more. For starters, there was that Nobel Peace Prize he won in 1989. High-profile supporters, like actor Richard Gere, helped give him and his people's struggles pop culture prominence, as did several mainstream films including ""Seven Years in Tibet,"" starring Brad Pitt, and ""Kundun,"" directed by Martin Scorsese. With the increased exposure, there has also been a growing prevalence of ""Free Tibet"" bumper stickers, the appearance of Tibetan prayer flags in suburbia and Facebook fans who shower the Dalai Lama with praise. ""Have a nice and easy day with Obama! Namaste,"" one woman wrote Thursday. ""thank you for all your love, guidance and wisdom ... u changed my life,"" a man added. And then this from a college-student fan: ""HH Dalai Lama!! You kick metaphorical ass!!!"" How has all this attention not gone to his head? ""When fame happens, people get carried away, right? The Dalai Lama, despite tremendous adoration as well as adulation ... is very conscious of that,"" Tethong said. ""One of the Buddhist practices is to always be very aware of one's self and how one looks at one's self and not to be carried away with one's ego."" Not standing on formalities -- he playfully threw snow at reporters outside the White House on Thursday -- staying grounded and his constant ability to exude warmth and joy have made him easy to love, people who admire him say. ""He really is the real deal -- a truly loveable guy. He lives his values,"" said Jamie Metzl, executive vice president of the Asia Society, a global organization that seeks to increase understanding and relationships between the U.S. and Asia. ""Recognizing someone who lives their life according to such positive principles helps us all grow."" And Metzl, who said he's met the Dalai Lama three times, suggested the Chinese government, through its denunciation of the spiritual leader, has bolstered his recognition. He said that by saying the Dalai Lama is ""a wolf in sheep's clothing,"" a claim Metzl said doesn't match what people read and see, ""the Chinese are doing a great deal to turn him into a rock star."" But nothing does more to make people appreciate the Dalai Lama than being with him, said Charles Raison, a psychiatrist with Emory University Medical School. Raison, who's been involved in a program where Western doctors work with and exchange teachings with Buddhist monks, recounted a time when he, his wife and several others met with the Dalai Lama about four years ago. ""Many people, myself included, have a powerful experience in his presence. I nearly erupted in tears,"" he said. And his wife, whom he said ""does not have a religious bone in her body"" was ""just beaming."" He said studies have long shown that people have a physiological response to the behaviors, feelings and even smells put forth by others. ""Buddhists,"" he added, ""say that sweet smells come from a saint -- a mark of spiritual advancement.""","The Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual leader, has broad base of fans in America .

"(CNN) -- The magnitude-8.8 earthquake that rocked the west coast of Chile last month was violent enough to move the city of Concepcion at least 10 feet to the west and the capital, Santiago, about 11 inches to the west-southwest, researchers said. The quake also shifted other parts of South America, as far apart as the Falkland Islands and Fortaleza, Brazil. The results were reached via global positioning satellite measurements taken before and after the February 27 quake by teams from The Ohio State University, the University of Hawaii, the University of Memphis and the California Institute of Technology, as well as agencies across South America. NASA scientists have also credited the quake with shifting the Earth's axis enough to create shorter days. The change is negligible, but still worth noting: Each day should be 1.26 microseconds shorter, according to preliminary calculations. A microsecond is one-millionth of a second. A large quake -- like the one that hit Chile's Maule region -- shifts massive amounts of rock and alters the distribution of mass on the planet. When that distribution changes, it changes the rate at which the planet rotates. And the rotation rate determines the length of a day. ""Any worldly event that involves the movement of mass affects the Earth's rotation,"" Benjamin Fong Chao, of NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, said while explaining the phenomenon in 2005. Despite the tragedy of the earthquake, which killed hundreds of Chileans, scientists see opportunities to gain valuable information in the aftermath. ""The Maule earthquake will arguably become one of the, if not the most important, great earthquakes yet studied,"" said Ben Brooks of the School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology at the University of Hawaii. ""We now have modern, precise instruments to evaluate this event.""","Earthquake also shifted other parts of South America .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand braced for anti-government demonstrations that began Friday and were expected to peak over the weekend with as many as 150,000 protesters on the streets. In anticipation, the government has mobilized 50,000 security forces, said acting spokesman Panitan Wattanayakorn. The mass rallies are expected to be peaceful but Army spokesman Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd said that crowd-control measures will be used if necessary. ""We will exercise the most effort to explain to demonstrators not to resort to violence, but if worse comes to worst, we may have to apply tear gas,"" he said. The ""red shirt"" opposition protesters include supporters of former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. Thaksin was the only Thai prime minister to serve a full-term in office and remains hugely popular. Are you there? Send pics, video to iReport . The protesters say that current Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva was not democratically elected and have demanded that he call new elections. Since Thaksin's ouster, Thailand has endured widespread political unrest that has pitted Thaksin loyalists against Abhisit's supporters. In September, tens of thousands of red shirt demonstrators converged on the Thai capital, Bangkok, to mark the third anniversary of the coup that ousted Thaksin.

"Lagos, Nigeria (CNN)  -- Nigeria on Tuesday faced international calls to bring to justice killer mobs armed with guns and knives who massacred hundreds of villagers in the country's rural heartland. As more details of the atrocities emerged, Nigeria's acting president, Goodluck Jonathan, replaced his national security adviser, although it was not clear whether the move was related to the weekend violence. At least 200 Christian villagers died in the attacks early Sunday, when groups of men with guns, machetes, and knives attacked people in three villages south of Jos, in the Plateau State, Human Rights Watch said. Other agencies gave higher death tolls. Sani Shehu, president of the nongovernmental agency Civil Rights Congress, put the number of dead at about 485. And a Christian leader who participated in a mass burial of 67 bodies Monday in one of the towns said about 375 people were dead or still missing. Explainer: What's behind the violence . Human Rights Watch cited witnesses as saying the attackers were Islamic men and that they targeted Christians, mostly from the Berom ethnic group. The victims were in the villages of Dogo Nahawa, Zot, and Ratsat, about 10 kilometers (6 miles) south of Jos, the state capital. The attackers had previously lived in the villages but left last month, Human Rights Watch said, citing multiple witness accounts. Witnesses, community leaders, and journalists who visited the villages told Human Rights Watch they saw bodies -- including those of children and babies -- inside houses, on the streets, and in the pathways leading out of the villages. They said many homes, cars, and other items were burned and destroyed. The U.S. diplomatic mission to Nigeria expressed its ""deep regret"" at the violence in the area. ""We extend our sympathies to those who have lost their loved ones and friends, and for the massive destruction of property,"" the mission said in a statement. ""We continue to urge all parties to exercise restraint and seek constructive means for addressing the continuing cycle of violence in Plateau State. Such loss of life and destruction cannot continue to weaken the fabric of unity and peace that all Nigerians love."" The mission called on the Nigerian government to make sure the attackers are brought to justice. Human Rights Watch called on Jonathan to make sure the attacks are ""thoroughly and promptly investigated"" and to prosecute those responsible. The attacks were reprisals for previous attacks against Islamic communities in the area and the theft of cattle from herdsmen, Human Rights Watch said. Police have arrested 98 people in connection with those attacks, the group said, citing official police figures. John Onaiyekan, the archbishop of Abuja, told Vatican Radio on Monday that the violence is the result of a dispute over access to natural resources, not religion. ""This kind of terrible violence has left thousands dead in Plateau state in the past decade,"" said Corinne Dufka, a senior West Africa researcher at Human Rights Watch. ""The authorities need to protect these communities, bring the perpetrators to book, and address the root causes of violence."" Jonathan, who was installed as acting head of state in February while President Umaru Yar'Adua recovers from illness, has called for calm. He put security on high alert Sunday and began operations to seek the attackers. Human Rights Watch said the additional military presence and patrols have been largely limited, however, to major roads and towns and have not protected the smaller communities. The most populous country in Africa, with a population of more than 150 million, Nigeria is almost evenly divided between Muslims and Christians. With more than 78 million Muslims, it has the sixth-largest Islamic population in the world, according to a study last year by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life. While some outbursts of violence are between Christians and Muslims, other disputes are based on ethnicity. The country is home to 250 to 400 ethnic groups, making it one of the most diverse African nations, according to the International Displacement Monitoring Centre.

"(CNN) -- Despite calls from President Obama to beef up the program designed to provide security aboard U.S. flights, the Federal Air Marshal Service is in disarray, a CNN investigation has found. In more than a dozen interviews across the country, air marshals said the agency is rife with cronyism; age, gender and racial discrimination; and attempts by managers to make the agency appear more efficient than it is by padding numbers. Air marshals describe an agency in chaos, where bored and frustrated marshals focus more on internal squabbles than watching for bad guys. The marshals refused to let their identities be known, for fear of retaliation in an agency that is driven, they say, by intimidation and favoritism. After a Nigerian's attempt to blow up an airliner preparing to land in Detroit, Michigan, on Christmas Day, a growing number of critics have called for either the elimination or a total overhaul of the agency. Last week, President Obama asked Congress for an additional $85 million to boost the air marshals program, known by its acronym FAMS, after the foiled attack aboard the jet coming from the Netherlands. U.S. officials have charged Nigerian Umar Farouk AbdulMutallab with attempting to blow up the airliner. He was subdued by passengers and crew. No air marshals were on the flight, generating additional criticism of the service. Despite efforts by Obama and assurances by Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano that FAMS will become more effective, one air marshal told CNN, ""Nothing's particularly changed for me since Christmas Day, or (for) a big percentage of people that I work with. Everything is pretty much the same."" In January, Napolitano testified before a Senate committee, where she vowed, ""We will strengthen the capacity of aviation law enforcement, including the Federal Air Marshal Service."" International flights are considered to have the highest risk. However, air marshals from a half dozen FAMS field offices said the agency continues to assign marshals to short, regional routes on small jets. The marshals told CNN that lots of short-haul flights make the agency look more productive on paper. The marshals said if someone dares criticize a manager, he or she can be banished to what they call ""Team America,"" referring to the regional trips. Managers and favored employees receive the perk of traveling international routes, they said. Repeatedly, air marshals reported that the decision on who flies on what flights are driven by extra pay for managers, and office politics -- not security. Despite repeated requests, FAMS and its parent agency, the Transportation Security Administration, declined to give CNN an interview. However, TSA spokesman Nelson Minerly provided a statement, saying, ""The Transportation Security Administration's Federal Air Marshals are strategically deployed aboard U.S. flagged air carriers to ensure the safety and security of the traveling public. ""The Federal Air Marshal Service is currently training and deploying fellow federal law enforcement officers to support the administration's enhancement in aviation security. Federal Air Marshals and these additional highly trained officers are being deployed aboard an increasing number of flights worldwide to keep air travel safe,"" Minerly wrote. Rep. John Duncan, R-Tennessee, is one of FAMS' harshest critics. ""It's just a total waste of money,"" he told CNN in a recent interview. ""I know that any time you create a federal bureaucracy, it just grows and grows, and the appropriation just goes up and up, but ... look at the record. They haven't done anything."" ""I had the statistic from last year,"" the Republican said. ""They made four arrests for an appropriation of $800 million. It came out to more than $200 million per arrest. It's just ridiculous."" Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Texas, doesn't want FAMS eliminated, she wants it revamped. ""If we've got those kinds of problems, we need to get a ready broom and sweep,"" she said. ""The only way we are going to ensure the security and safety of the American people is that we have staff par excellence, and I know they are out there."" Although the actual number of air marshals is classified, it has been widely reported that the number of air marshals covering 28,000 flights per day is fewer than 4,000. Even with a generous calculation, the marshals only cover 5 percent of flights, according to CNN assessments. CNN has been studying FAMS for three years, and during that time, air marshals have accused managers of using creative accounting to pad the numbers given to Congress. They describe an agency in chaos that, in some cases, promotes discrimination against minorities. ""We don't have managers who provide training or provide leadership or do anything other than produce conflict,"" one said. John Mueller, a political science professor at Ohio State University, has completed a cost-benefit analysis of U.S. aviation security. He concluded many measures such as FAMS are little more than a waste of taxpayer dollars. ""We have seen with the underwear bomber (AbdulMutallab), the passengers aren't going to sit around waiting for someone else to do something. Because their lives are at stake, they are going to jump in. So essentially from a hijackers' standpoint, this idea of replicating 9/11 is close to impossible as far as I can see,"" Mueller said. The air marshal program was set up in 1970, after a rash of airline hijackings, and it was expanded significantly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. Specially trained to safeguard passengers and crew aboard crowded aircraft, air marshals were seen as a critical component in the overall effort to secure America's commercial aviation system.

"(CNN) -- Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger has called on his team to continue their rejuvenated bid to win the English Premier League title in the wake of the horrific broken leg suffered by young midfielder Aaron Ramsey. The 19-year-old Wales international has been ruled out for the rest of the season after sustaining fractures to the tibia and fibula in his right leg in Saturday's 3-1 victory against Stoke City. The injury, caused by a challenge from Stoke's new England squad member Ryan Shawcross, brought back memories of the horror break suffered by Arsenal teammate Eduardo against Birmingham two years ago. Ramsey is seen as a star of the future, having impressed after making 29 appearances in his second season with the club. The Londoners battled back from 1-0 down at Stoke to move to within three points of leaders Chelsea, who had two players sent off in a 4-2 defeat at home to Manchester City on Saturday. Wenger believes his team can still win the title despite recent defeats to Chelsea and second-placed Manchester United. ""It will be tight until the end,"" the Frenchman told the club's official Web site. ""But this group is so strong mentally and have a unity, so this will give us one more reason to fight until the end and do it for him. ""We had some other problems two years ago. But on Saturday we had a midfield of Nasri, Fabregas, Ramsey, Song, Eboue. They have an average of 20 or 21 years old. Up front, Bendtner is 21 years old. ""At their age, to handle the game like they did is absolutely remarkable."" Wenger's dedication to ""the beautiful game"" has often seen his team criticized for being ""soft"" but he said that he often tells his players off for not committing to tackles. ""I encourage my players to play and be committed,"" he said. ""I have a go at them when they don't put their foot in sometimes. ""But as well, sometimes I nearly feel guilty to do that because when Aaron goes for the ball like he did on Saturday and gets done like he did, it is not an easy situation. ""But the way I try to play the game, I believe, is the right way. When we don't win I get a lot of stick because of that way, but I still prefer to continue to play like that. ""We will respect the game, the opponents and try to give pleasure to people who watch us.""","Arsenal midfielder Aaron Ramsey ruled out for rest of season with badly-broken leg .

"United Nations (CNN) -- The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor reported Friday to the U.N. Security Council that violence continues in Darfur and that the Sudanese president and his government are not cooperating with investigators. Luis Moreno-Ocampo noted positive developments in judicial proceedings and ""fruitful"" cooperation with international bodies, but said there still remain many setbacks. He explained that crimes continue in the region, including ""indiscriminate bombings of civilians ... rapes and sexual violence"" and the ""use of child soldiers."" Moreno-Ocampo also highlighted Sudanese President Omar Hassan al-Bashir's role in the situation. ""Any leader committing crimes will face justice. Power does not provide immunity."" Al-Bashir has refused to appoint a lawyer to represent his position in court and, because of the ICC-issued warrant for his arrest, has not risked traveling to attend high-level events such as the U.N. General Assembly or a meeting held by the Organization of the Islamic Conference, or to other countries where it had been thought he might go, such as Uganda, Nigeria and Venezuela. Moreno-Ocampo said respect for the International Criminal Court's decision to issue the warrant would send a clear message that al-Bashir ""will face justice."" ""There was no immunity for President [Slobodan] Milosevic [of the former Yugoslavia], there was no immunity for Prime Minister [Jean] Kambanda [of Rwanda], there was no immunity for President [Charles] Taylor [of Liberia],"" he said. Instead of complying with the Security Council, al-Bashir has used the Sudanese state apparatus ""to commit massive crimes"" and has attempted to ""exacerbate"" the conflict in the South as means of shifting the international community's attention away from Darfur, Moreno-Ocampo said. He also accused al-Bashir of ""stopping information about the crimes"" rather than stopping the crimes themselves. Deputy U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. Rosemary DiCarlo called on the Sudanese government to fully cooperate with the International Criminal Court and its investigations as called for in Security Council Resolution 1593. ""The United States believes that those responsible for the atrocities in Darfur must be held accountable"" as they ""affect the stability of Sudan as a whole,"" she said. DiCarlo said the ongoing violence in Darfur undermines ""an already fragile humanitarian situation"" and urged all states ""to refrain from providing political or financial support"" to those charged by the International Criminal Court . Moreno-Ocampo said his office was considering holding responsible Sudanese officials ""who actively deny and dissimulate crimes."" ""Since Nuremberg, due obedience is no longer a legal excuse"" for the facilitation of such criminal acts, he said. Sudanese Ambassador Abdalmahmood Abdalhaleem Mohamad responded by calling Moreno-Ocampo a ""mercenary of death and destruction,"" back once more to spread his ""illusions"" and ""catastrophic vision."" ""This is a big lie. The war in Darfur is over,"" he said. Mohamad turned to those in the Security Council who asked for justice, and said they ""should feel ashamed"" and that their ""credibility is at stake, if they have any."" The Sudanese ambassador said Moreno-Ocampo ""would like to prolong the suffering of our people,"" and said, ""We will charge him with political prostitution."" Reiterating his role as prosecutor is ""to investigate and prosecute to contribute to the prevention of future crimes,"" Moreno-Ocampo said he is ""ready to answer any challenge in court."" However, he acknowledged he would need the Security Council's full support ""to end the current crimes against the people from Darfur.""","The International Criminal Court's chief prosecutor reported Friday to the U.N.

"Tokyo, Japan (CNN) -- Four American teenagers, all children of U.S. military personnel, have been arrested on charges of attempted murder after a woman was knocked off her motorbike with rope strung across two poles, Japanese police said. The four suspects -- two 15-year-old boys, a 17-year-old girl and an 18-year-old man -- were taken into custody on Saturday, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department said. They are accused of causing a severe head injury to a 23-year-old restaurant employee by stringing a rope between poles across a road. U.S. Forces Japan was informed of the August incident in late October, a public information officer said. There was no clear explanation for the delay in the handover of the suspects to police, other than it involved rules between Washington and Tokyo covering U.S. forces and their dependents in Japan. The U.S. military presence and its impact on Japanese residents have been a thorny issue over the years. Most recently, residents of the Japanese island of Okinawa, where the U.S. maintains a large military presence, have blamed American troops for crime and noise. In 2008, a 14-year-old Okinawa girl alleged that a Marine had raped her. The prosecutor released the Marine after the girl decided not to pursue charges. In 1995, a 12-year-old girl was gang-raped by three servicemen. A Japanese court convicted all three men. Both incidents caused a furor in Japan. Then-Prime Minister Yasuo Fukuda called the 2008 incident ""unforgivable ... It has happened over and over again in the past and I take it as a grave case."" It is unclear what, if any, role the military can take in the case. The 1960 Status of Forces Agreement between the United States and Japan gives Japan jurisdiction over ""the members of the United States armed forces, the civilian component, and their dependents"" in cases of offenses committed in Japan and punishable under Japanese law. The agreement also says the United States must cooperate in investigating such offenses.

"(CNN) -- Federal authorities are investigating a New Jersey man suspected of being an al Qaeda member and going on a deadly rampage at a hospital in Yemen. The FBI is investigating Sharif Mobley, a 26-year-old from Buena, New Jersey, said Rich Wolf, a spokesman at the agency's Baltimore, Maryland, office. He wouldn't comment further. Mobley had worked at nuclear plants operated by PSEG Nuclear for different contractors from 2002 to 2008, doing routing labor such as carrying supplies and assisting with maintenance activities, company spokesman Joe Delmar said. Mobley, who also worked at other nuclear plants in the region, satisfied federal security background checks required to work in the U.S. nuclear industry as recently as 2008, he said. Mobley is accused of shooting and killing a security agent and severely injuring another while trying to flee the Republican Hospital in Sanaa, Yemen, over the weekend, a law enforcement source said. Yemeni counterterrorism forces rushed to the hospital and captured Mobley, who had barricaded himself in a hospital room, said Mohammed Albasha, a spokesman for the Yemeni embassy in Washington. Yemeni authorities had detained Mobley and 10 other al Qaeda suspects earlier this month in a ""successful security sweep"" in the capital of Sanaa, Albasha said. He had been transported to the hospital over the weekend for medical treatment, Albasha said, though he would not elaborate. The law enforcement source said the FBI has interviewed Mobley's parents. Another source, a U.S. law enforcement official familiar with the case, said authorities have been aware of Mobley for some time. Both law enforcement sources were unaware of any criminal charges against Mobley in the United States. Delmar of PSEG said the company is cooperating with authorities investigating Mobley.

"(CNN) -- A November 1 trial date has been set for Brian David Mitchell, who is suspected in the 2002 kidnapping of Utah teenager Elizabeth Smart, said a spokeswoman for federal prosecutors. U.S. District Judge Dale Kimball set the trial date at a scheduling conference Friday, said Melodie Rydalch, spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney's office in Utah. Mitchell was not in court that day, she said. The trial is expected to take two weeks, according to the case file. Mitchell's defense attorneys have apparently indicated they will file a motion asking for a change of venue, as the case file said Kimball set a May 26 deadline for the motion and agreed to hear arguments before July 11. Mitchell is accused of abducting Smart, then 14, at knifepoint from her bedroom in her family's Salt Lake City, Utah, home in June 2002. Smart was found nine months later, walking down a street in the Salt Lake City suburb of Sandy with Mitchell and his wife, Wanda Eileen Barzee. Mitchell, a drifter and self-described prophet who called himself ""Emmanuel,"" had done some handyman work at the Smarts' home. Barzee, now 64, pleaded guilty in November to kidnapping and unlawful transportation of a minor. As part of a plea deal with prosecutors, she agreed to cooperate in the state and federal cases against her husband. Earlier this month, Kimball ruled Mitchell, now 56, is competent to stand trial. State court proceedings against him have been on hold pending the outcome of the federal case. Smart, now 21, testified in October as part of Mitchell's competency hearing that after kidnapping her, Mitchell took her to a wooded area behind her home and performed a mock marriage ceremony with her before sexually assaulting her. She testified that in the nine months of her captivity, no 24-hour period passed without Mitchell raping her. Kimball's ruling on Mitchell's competency cannot be appealed until after the case concludes. Barzee had been housed at the Utah State Hospital while courts determined her competency as well as that of her husband. A state court had ruled she could be forcibly medicated, and that ruling led federal prosecutors to file charges against her. Last month, Barzee pleaded guilty but mentally ill in state court in the attempted kidnapping of Smart's cousin a month after her kidnapping. In exchange for the plea to one count of conspiracy to commit aggravated kidnapping, state prosecutors dropped charges against Barzee in Smart's abduction. Federal prosecutors have recommended that Barzee serve a sentence of 15 years, but asked that her sentencing date be continued to allow for her participation in the case against Mitchell. She faces between one and 15 years in prison on the state charge, but prosecutors agreed to allow that sentence to run concurrently with the federal sentence.","Brian David Mitchell is charged with kidnapping Elizabeth Smart from her bedroom in 2002 .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- An international human rights organization on Sunday faulted Israel's investigation into alleged war crimes last year in Gaza. Israel has not demonstrated that it will conduct thorough and objective investigations, Human Rights Watch said in a statement. ""An independent investigation is crucial to understand why so many civilians died and to bring justice for the victims of unlawful attacks,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East director for the New York-based organization. In September, the United Nations Human Rights Council released a report by noted South African jurist Richard Goldstone. The report concluded that both sides committed war crimes during the conflict, which killed about 1,400 Palestinians and 13 Israelis. But U.N. chief Ban Ki-moon said last week that the world body has not made a determination on whether both sides have done enough to investigate allegations they committed war crimes during the three-week conflict, which began at the end of December 2008. In a report, Ban outlines steps Israelis and Palestinians have taken to fulfill a U.N. demand for credible and transparent inquiries into civilian casualties. However, he concludes, ""As such, no determination can be made on the implementation of the resolution by the parties concerned."" Israel handed Ban a response outlining the steps the nation has taken to investigate charges of wrongdoing by its military during the course of the offensive in Gaza, which was aimed at stopping militant rocket fire into Israel. The Israeli military has ""launched investigations into 150 separate incidents, including 36 criminal investigations opened thus far,"" according to the report. For its part, the Palestinian Authority said it had created a commission to look into various charges of abuses, but made clear that it did not view the potential wrongdoing on the Palestinian side as seriously as that allegedly committed by the Israeli military. ""There is absolutely no symmetry or proportionality between the occupying power and the occupied people"" wrote Riyad Mansour, Palestinian ambassador to the United Nations. In Gaza, the ruling Hamas movement released a summary of the steps taken to investigate wrongdoing, saying it had prevented militants from targeting civilians. But the rights organization dismissed the conclusion as ""factually wrong."" Human Rights Watch said it is still reviewing a full Hamas report. ""Hamas can spin the story and deny the evidence, but hundreds of rockets rained down on civilian areas in Israel where no military installations were located,"" Stork said.

"(Travel + Leisure) -- When I first started traveling, I was delighted by refrigerator magnets, T-shirts, embroidered patches and snow globes -- all the usual gift-shop kitsch. At some point, however, it struck me as a shortcut, celebrating a destination's clichés rather than the place itself. So I moved up to items that were unavailable on every other corner and, ideally, handmade. I felt good about supporting craftspeople, and the objects had more personal resonance. Though when I got them home, many of them turned into dust-catching clutter -- one-of-a-kind clutter, but still. Moreover, I questioned their authenticity. I make every effort to eat at restaurants frequented by locals. Why would I shop for souvenirs in stores where residents never tread? Now, I hunt for what I call ""unsouvenirs."" The word souvenir is Middle French for ""remembering,"" and unsouvenirs, despite the prefix, must also be able to trigger a memory. But they're different from souvenirs in that they capture the essence of a place not simply because they were purchased there, but because -- this is the important part -- locals actually use them. Travel + Leisure: World's strangest Olympic souvenirs . That's the best definition for cultural authenticity that I can come up with. While I prefer that my unsouvenirs originate in the destination (""made in China"" is only appealing if you're in China), I don't mind if they come from a factory. Few of us can claim that we incorporate many handmade items into our day-to-day lives. I just visited Rome for the first time -- ridiculous, I know -- and I was surprised by how rife with kitsch the historic center is. Rare is the block that doesn't have a store selling I © ROME T-SHIRTS. My customs form, in contrast, looked as if I had run errands on a Saturday afternoon. I bought a plastic container designed to hold the unsliced part of an onion, premixed Campari and soda in Art Deco bottles, a package of assorted paper from an art-supply shop, Elmex toothpaste, and a lip balm called HerpeSun. They'll remind me of Rome every time I use them (though I haven't yet been brave enough to whip out the lip balm in public). Travel + Leisure: World's most beautiful airports . Certain kinds of stores are more reliable for unsouvenirs. Supermarkets and pharmacies are always interesting. Cookware purveyors are also a consistently rich source: you might score Bialetti espresso pots from coffee-crazy Italy or elegant woven place mats from understated Sweden. At a Japanese hardware store you could come upon a miniature scythe-style weeder; or you might spot a cowbell and collar in northern Italy. (Part of the fun is repurposing: that bell could be a doorbell.) Stationery shops, whether you're in Greece or Indonesia, tend to have schoolkids' notebooks, which make for quirky journals back home. Also worth a look are stores that sell hobby or restaurant supplies, sporting goods, garden equipment, bike gear.... ""You have to get off the map,"" agrees the queen of unsouvenirs, Alisa Grifo, co-owner of Kiosk, a store in New York's SoHo that stocks workaday objects from around the world (usually one country at a time, displayed in four-to-six-month ""exhibitions""), all acquired during Grifo's peripatetic travels. Highlights from Germany included egg cups, a pencil sharpener and a doorstop; from Hong Kong, a mailbox, green twine and a calculator. Individually, the items are idiosyncratic and well designed; gathered together, they convey the spirit of a country, in both their utility and their aesthetics. (To see what I mean, visit kioskkiosk.com.) I assumed that Grifo had the same wander-and-hope strategy that I do, but she and her husband and co-owner Marco Romeny actually do a ton of prep work. They research each destination, reading up on the history, culture, museums, food, crafts, anything. And they network like mad: ""We ask ourselves, 'Who do we know from there? Who has relatives there?'"" Most important, they're usually in a country for two to six weeks, which means they stay -- and shop -- in residential neighborhoods. Just as the ideal unsouvenir reflects locals' daily existence, the best way to shop for unsouvenirs is by practicing a bit of cultural immersion -- in other words, when in Rome, shop as the Romans do. As Grifo and I chatted, I bragged about my onion container, which I consider a symbol of my victory in tourist-clogged Rome. If any other American traveler brought home a plastic onion this year, I'll eat mine -- washed down with more than one bottle of Campari Soda. Grifo's eyes lit up. ""That's brilliant,"" she said. ""How does it open? Can you send me a photo?"" Maybe someday Kiosk will tackle Italy, and my little onion holder will be part of the exhibition. That would be fantastic -- as long as we all remember who found it first. Erik Torkells is an editor at tripadvisor.com and the founder of tribecacitizen.com. Planning a beach getaway?

"Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- Thirty-six people were killed and dozens were injured in explosions at a market in Lahore, Pakistan, on Monday, an official said. Rizwan Naseer, chief of Lahore's rescue service, also said 109 people were wounded. The explosions did not appear to be a suicide attack but could instead have been bombs detonated by remote control, Punjab Police Chief Tariq Salim said. The nation's state-run news agency, Associated Press of Pakistan, said the blasts were the result of ""bomb explosions."" The explosions occurred at Moon Market in the Iqbal Town neighborhood, the news agency said. It cited Iqbal Town Division's Ali Nasir Rizvi as saying most of the victims were women. Khusro Pervaiz, a senior government official in Lahore, said in a television interview that 60 people had been taken to five Lahore hospitals. The blasts happened around 8:45 p.m. at the popular market, said Rai Nazar Hayat, a spokesman for Lahore police. Earlier, ten people were killed -- including two police officers -- when a suicide bomber detonated outside a district courthouse in Peshawar on Monday, officials said. At least 36 were injured, six of them seriously, said Dr. Hameed Afridi, CEO of the Lady Reading Hospital. The bomber got out of a rickshaw and detonated himself, according to witnesses. The attacker was wearing a suicide jacket with about 6 kilograms of explosives, said Shafqat Malik, head of the North West Frontier Province bomb disposal unit. Peshawar is the capital of the Northwest Frontier Province, where the Pakistani government waged a recent military offense against Taliban militants. Meanwhile, five people were hurt in a bomb attack in Quetta on Monday morning, said Jamil Kakar, a Quetta police official. The explosives were placed in a car and destroyed two other cars and three motorbikes. The courthouse attack comes three days after four militants armed with guns and grenades stormed a mosque in Rawalpindi frequented by military personnel. At least 36 were killed and 75 wounded. Among the dead were 17 children, according to military officials. Also killed were an army general and eight other military officials, six of senior rank. The Pakistani Taliban claimed responsibility for the mosque bombing. The Tehrik-i-Taliban Pakistan reiterated its claim in an e-mail to CNN the next day, after media outlets quoted officials who doubted the group's participation. ""We reconfirmed it, that the TTP has done it and will do more which are already planned,"" the group said in the e-mail. ""We once again mention that we are not against the innocent people and the state of Pakistan but against those officers and ministers who are American by hearts and minds and Pakistani just by faces.""

"(CNN) -- Unbeaten American Floyd Mayweather Jr claims he will knock out WBO welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao when the two boxing giants lock horns next year. Speaking on HBO TV's Joe Buck chat show, the 32-year-old Mayweather -- who has an unblemished record from 40 fights -- said: ""Pacquiao's a good fighter but I've been around the sport a long time and I've dominated boxing for around 15 years now. ""Nobody has defeated me yet so we'll have to see. The thing is, I don't want the fans to be really shocked by what will happen when we do happen to meet up -- because it's not going to be anything new for them."" ""The things is, Manny has been knocked out before and he's taken losses. I'll be victorious."" Filipino Pacquiao will come into the fight following a remarkable 12 months which has seen him defeat de la Hoya, Ricky Hatton and Miguel Cotto. Meanwhile, Mayweather has fought only once in two years, a unanimous points victory over Juan Manuel Marquez in las Vegas. Although definitive plans for the mega-money contest are yet to be confirmed, a date of March 13 is widely rumored to be agreed, with three possible venues in the running to stage the contest. The two fighters are regarded as the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world right now and the fight is expected to generate record levels of interest, easily surpassing the previous record of $18.4m for gate receipts, which was generated for Mayweather's bout with Oscar De La Hoya in 2007. Two NFL stadiums are reported to be bidding to host the fight. Cowboy Stadium in Arlington, Texas, home of the Dallas Cowboys, is competing with the Superdome in New Orleans, as well as the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. The two stadiums could accommodate up to 100,000 spectators, while the MGM Grand seats about 16,000.","Floyd Mayweather Jr claims he will knock out WBO welterweight world champion Manny Pacquiao .

"(CNN) -- Gillette said Saturday it was ""limiting"" golfer Tiger Woods' role in its marketing programs to give him the privacy he needs to work on family relationships after disclosures of his ""infidelity."" In a statement, the Boston, Massachusetts-based body grooming company said it supports Woods' decision to take ""an indefinite break"" from professional golf. On his Web site Friday, Woods admitted to infidelity and said he was taking a break from the sport to focus on his family. ""In the midst of a difficult and unfortunate situation, we respect the action Tiger is taking to restore the trust of his family, friends and fans,"" Gillette spokesman Mike Norton said in the statement. ""We fully support him stepping back from his professional career and taking the time he needs to do what matters most. We wish him and his family the best. ""As Tiger takes a break from the public eye, we will support his desire for privacy by limiting his role in our marketing programs,"" Norton said. Woods' Friday posting said: ""After much soul searching, I have decided to take an indefinite break from professional golf. I need to focus my attention on being a better husband, father and person."" ""I am deeply aware of the disappointment and hurt that my infidelity has caused to so many people, most of all my wife and children,"" Woods' statement said. ""I want to say again to everyone that I am profoundly sorry and that I ask forgiveness. It may not be possible to repair the damage I've done, but I want to do my best to try."" Woods, 33, who tops the sport's world rankings, crashed his car outside his Florida mansion late last month. Authorities issued a citation for careless driving, and he was given a $164 fine. Woods was not required to talk to police about the wreck and declined to talk with investigators on several occasions. In the week following the crash, Woods apologized for ""transgressions"" that let his family down. The same day, US Weekly published a report alleging that Woods had an affair with Jaimee Grubbs, a 24-year-old cocktail waitress. US Weekly's report followed a National Enquirer article before the crash that the athlete was having an affair with New York nightclub hostess Rachel Uchitel, an assertion she vigorously denied, according to The New York Post. It was not immediately clear how Woods' hiatus would affect his other sponsorships, which include Nike, Gatorade and Electronic Arts. ""He is the best golfer in the world and one of the greatest athletes of his era,"" Nike spokeswoman Beth Gast said in a statement. ""We look forward to his return to golf. He and his family have Nike's full support."" The statement did not elaborate on whether Woods' announcement would impact his business relationship with the sports company, which has worked with him for more than a decade. Woods has won three U.S. Open titles and the Masters tournament and the PGA tournament each four times. The PGA Tour said it supports Woods and looks forward to his return to the game. ""We fully support Tiger's decision to step away from competitive golf to focus on his family. His priorities are where they need to be, and we will continue to respect and honor his family's request for privacy,"" the PGA Tour said in a statement Friday. ""We look forward to Tiger's return to the PGA Tour when he determines the time is right for him."" EA Sports, the company that makes Woods' video game, also said it is standing behind the golfer. ""We respect that this is a very difficult and private situation for Tiger and his family. At this time, the strategy for our Tiger Woods PGA TOUR business remains unchanged,"" said David Tinson, a company spokesman.","Grooming company cuts back on Tiger Woods' time after admission of ""infidelity""

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- More than 170 people around the globe, including at least 61 in the United States, have been arrested in a major operation targeting international child pornographers, officials said Friday. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and European Union representatives announced the sting's results Friday. Operation Joint Hammer has rescued 11 girls in the United States, ages 3 to 13, who were sexually abused by child pornography producers, U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey and representatives of the European Union said at the Justice Department. Dozens more were located in Europe, including several young female victims in Ukraine. Authorities found connections between producers, distributors and customers in nearly 30 countries as a single investigation grew to a global inquiry into the dark corners of brutality and child abuse. The investigation, code-named Operation Koala in Europe, was developed when investigators determined that a pornographic video found in Australia had been produced in Belgium. ""This joint EU-U.S. coordinated effort began with the discovery in Europe of a father who was sexually abusing his young daughters and producing images of that abuse,"" Mukasey said. Further investigation showed a number of online child porn rings. Some included dangerous offenders who not only traded child pornography but also sexually abused children, the officials said. Agents are still attempting to locate child victims whose images have appeared in photos and videos, and more arrests are expected as the FBI, Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the Postal Inspection Service continue the investigation. A Postal Service official said ringleaders primarily targeted prepubescent female victims to satisfy their customers but noted that other groups produce photos and videos of boys and girls of all ages -- or even infants. ""For this subset, that's what turns them on,"" the official said.","U.S., European officials join for child pornographer sting .

"London, England (CNN) -- A number of Latin American countries have rushed to offer their support to Argentina in its long-running territorial dispute with Britain over the Falkland Islands. This week Britain began drilling for oil in the waters off the archipelago, despite opposition from Buenos Aires which claims sovereignty over the islands it calls Las Malvinas. The project has reignited tensions between the two countries, who fought a brief war over the islands in 1982, with Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner accusing London of ignoring international law. Argentina says the natural resources around the islands, which lie in the South Atlantic Ocean off the Argentinean coast, should be protected, and Britain must accept international resolutions labeling the Falklands a disputed area. Mexico's President Felipe Calderon weighed into the dispute late Monday when he said a number of countries in the region had drafted a document in support of their South American neighbor. Speaking at a summit of Latin American leaders in the Mexican resort of Playa Del Carmen, Calderon claimed Ecuador, Chile, Guatemala, Bolivia and Venezuela had all backed Argentina's opposition to the drilling. ""We have approved a declaration in which leaders of countries and governments present here reaffirm their support for the Republic of Argentina's legitimate rights in its sovereignty dispute with the United Kingdom,"" he said in a statement issued by Argentine officials. Ecuador's President Rafael Correa offered his country's ""unconditional support"" to Argentina, while his Chilean counterpart Michelle Bachelet said, ""We not only support our sister republic's claims to the Malvinas islands but every year we present its case to the United Nations' Special Committee on Decolonization."" Venezuela's outspoken leader Hugo Chavez also reiterated his support for Argentina. ""We support unconditionally the Argentine government and the Argentine people in their complaints,"" Chavez told reporters Tuesday, according to Reuters.com. ""That sea and that land belongs to Argentina and to Latin America."" A day earlier, Chavez had used his weekly televised address to make a direct appeal to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II. ""Look, England, how long are you going to be in Las Malvinas? Queen of England, I'm talking to you,"" he said. ""The time for empires are over, haven't you noticed? Return the Malvinas to the Argentine people."" On Monday, British oil and gas exploration company Desire Petroleum announced that its Ocean Guardian rig had started drilling an exploration well in the North Falkland Basin, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) north of the islands. Desire estimates that the North Falkland Basin could contain 3.5 billion barrels of oil as well as having ""significant gas potential."" The exploratory drilling is expected to last around 30 days, a spokesman for the company told CNN. But the prospect of Britain making a highly lucrative discovery in region has infuriated Buenos Aires. This has to do with the defense of the interests of Argentineans, not just about sovereignty,"" Argentine Cabinet Chief Anibal Fernandez said last week, adding that Argentina lays claim not just to the islands, but to any resources that could be found there. In a statement last week, the Falkland Islands government, which represents its 2,500 residents, said it had ""every right to develop a hydrocarbons industry within our waters."" ""The British government has clearly stated that they support our right to develop legitimate business,"" it said. ""The British government have also reiterated their stance on our British sovereignty.""","Argentina and UK at odds over ownership of South Atlantic islands .

"(Entertainment Weekly) -- Once upon a time -- oh, let's just call it North America in the mid-'90s, shall we? -- Weezer and Alanis Morissette were an inescapable part of the cultural landscape, churning out buoyant rock-radio hits (Weezer), wordy, eccentric anthems (Alanis), and MTV-friendly videos (both) with impressive consistency. Alanis Morissette struggled to find a way to stay current after her last album failed to do well. Each act's follow-ups, however, have failed to yield quite the success of their initial impact. So how, in the face of a never-ending rush of fresh industry blood, does an already established act stay relevant? For Morissette, the answer on new CD ""Flavors of Entanglement"" seems to lie, for better or worse, in going through a really, really bad breakup. The same kind of passion that fueled the 15-million-selling '95 smash ""Jagged Little Pill"" (was there ever a woman more excellently scorned than the Alanis who excoriated her lover on ""You Oughta Know""?) is all over ""Entanglement"" -- thanks to a well-publicized split with actor fiance Ryan Reynolds. Granted, at 34, she still writes too often in the histrionic, no-one-has-ever-felt-what-I-feel style of a feverishly journaling liberal-arts major. Even so, the rawness of her hurt adds heft to eff-you screeds like the thunderous ""Versions of Violence,"" and she's found an able partner in producer and co-writer Guy Sigsworth, a onetime Björk collaborator. His dense, swirling compositions seem to push Morissette's boundaries, conjuring her inner Princess of Darkness on the glitchy, gothy ""Straitjacket"" and exploring Far Eastern exotica on the tabla-tinged opener ""Citizen of the Planet."" But her most affecting moment may be the most stripped down. A barely-there piano is all the accompaniment needed on the broken, fragile ballad ""Not as We,"" on which her voice cracks heartbreakingly over the lines ""From scratch begin again, but this time, I as I/And not as we."" Somehow, a devastating personal experience has galvanized her songwriting in a way that domestic bliss, as showcased on 2004's disappointing ""So-Called Chaos,"" could not. EW Grade: B+ .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN) -- Ten Americans held in Haiti on charges of illegally trying to take 33 children out of the country were scheduled to have their first court hearing Monday afternoon, according to the U.S. State Department. P.J. Crowley, a department spokesman, said Monday that U.S. and Haitian authorities are ""working to try to ascertain what happened [and] the motive behind these people. Clearly there are questions about procedure as to whether they had the appropriate paperwork to move the children."" The Americans were turned back Friday night as they tried to take the children across the border into the Dominican Republic. At least some of the group are members of the Central Valley Baptist Church in Meridian, Idaho. The missionaries say they were just trying to help the children start a new life. Central Valley's senior pastor, Clint Henry, reiterated that point Monday, saying the group's intentions were ""upright and pure."" ""The intention was simply to go down and try to be an aid in ministering to children that had been orphaned in the quake,"" the pastor said. ""It was our intention to be part of a new orphanage. The decision was made that we could house those children in the temporary sites."" But Haiti's prime minister said Sunday the group was kidnapping the children. ""From what I know until now, this is a kidnapping case,"" Jean-Max Bellerive told CNN. ""Who is doing it, I don't know. What are the real objectives or activities, I don't know. But that is kidnapping, and it is more serious because it's involving children."" He added, ""The children certainly were not fully willing to go, because in some cases, from what I heard, they were asking for their parents, they wanted to return to their parents."" U.S. Embassy officials visited the Americans over the weekend at a jail near the airport in Port-au-Prince. They are being treated well and are holding on to their faith, the Americans said. ""We came into Haiti to help those that really had no other source of help,"" Laura Silsby, a member of an Idaho-based charity, New Life Children's Refuge, said on Saturday. ""We are trusting the truth will be revealed, and we are praying for that."" The group of five men and five women said they were trying to move the children to the Dominican Republic after the 7.0-magnitude earthquake January 12 that devastated parts of Haiti, flattening the capital and killing tens of thousands. But a Haitian judge has charged the 10 with child trafficking, they said. The U.S. Embassy in Port-au-Prince said Sunday that the Americans had been detained for ""alleged violations of Haitian laws related to immigration."" Government approval is needed for any Haitian children to leave the country, and the group acknowledged that the children have no passports. Jeanne Bernard-Pierre, general director for Haiti's Institute of Social Welfare, said the children will be interviewed in the coming days to determine whether they have living relatives. The Americans said they believed the children were orphaned, and they were going to house them in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic. Georg Willeit of SOS Children's Villages, who said that Haitian police and the social ministry brought the children to his group after they were taken from the American group, said some of the children have living relatives. ""Some of them for sure are not orphans,"" he said. ""Immediately after she arrived here, a girl -- she might be 9 years old -- was crying loudly, 'I am not an orphan, I do have my parents, please call my parents,' "" he said. ""And some of the other kids as well, they have their phone numbers, even, with them from their parents,"" he said. He said he believes that at least 10 are not orphans. Mel Coulter, the father of Charisa Coulter, 23, who is among those arrested, told CNN affiliate KTVB on Saturday that the group members ""want to bring kids out who have no home, who have no parents, who have no hope -- and this was an attempt to give them the hope that they've lost in Haiti."" The Americans thought they had all of the necessary documents to transport the children out of the country, Coulter said, but they were stopped at the border Friday and told there was a paper missing. ""So they returned to Port-au-Prince, where they went in early [Saturday] morning to try and get the last documentation, and apparently were arrested on the spot and jailed."" He said the group wants ""to do everything according to the processes that are required.""

"New York (CNN) -- A man federal authorities say is part of a Brooklyn husband-and-wife identity theft team has been charged with killing two of their victims. Dmitriy Yakovlev, 42, is scheduled to be arraigned Monday in U.S. District Court in Brooklyn. The more serious charges were included in a supserseding indictment unsealed Thursday. Yakovlev was charged with the murder of Irina Malezhik, a Russian language translator who lived in Brooklyn and worked in the federal courts. She vanished in October 2007. He also is accused in the slaying of Viktor Alekseyev, who disappeared in December 2005 and whose remains were found in New Jersey in 2006, according to federal authorities. A third identity theft victim, Brooklyn resident Michael Klein, disappeared in November 2003 and has not been seen since. In addition to Yakovlev's murder charges, the new indictment charges him and wife Julia Yakovlev, 36, with 17 counts of identity theft, bank fraud, credit card fraud and ""effecting fraudulent transactions."" Julie Yakovlev was not charged in connection with the slayings but she has been accused of cashing $40,000 drawn from one victim's account, according to Robert Nardoza, spokesman for the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York. The couple was originally charged in August 2009 with illegally using the identities of three people between 2003 and 2007. Julie Takovlev is free on bail while her husband remains in custody, their attorneys said. ""Identity theft victims usually lose their money,"" NYPD Police Commissioner Ray Kelly said in a statement, ""In this case, they allegedly lost their lives, too."" Malezhik was last seen on October 15, 2007, leaving her apartment on a security video camera. Immediately after her disappearance, the couple began withdrawing money and purchasing various items in Malezhik's name, according to court documents. ""I'm skeptical as to the foundation and nature of charges,"" said Ken Russo, attorney for Dmitriy Yakovlev. Julia Yakovlev's attorney, Alexei Grosshtern, would only tell CNN that there are ""no new charges"" against his client.

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Gertrude Baines, a 114-year-old California resident, will likely be crowned the world's oldest woman, according to the organization that keeps track of such honors. Gertrude Baines told CNN two years ago that she has taken good care of herself, ""the way (God) wanted me to."" The previous oldest woman was Maria de Jesus, who died this week in Portugal at age 115, Guinness World Records said. Baines -- born to former slaves in a small town south of Atlanta, Georgia, in 1894 -- now lives in a Los Angeles nursing home. Baines appeared cheerful and talkative when the Los Angeles Times interviewed her in November as she cast her vote for Barack Obama for president, whom she said she supported because ""he's for the colored people."" ""I'm glad we're getting a colored man in there,"" she said. Baines apparently prefers using the older term for her race. She was well into her 70s when ""African-American"" became the common reference in the United States. Watch Baines speak to CNN . She told the Times she spends most of her time ""doing nothing but eating and sleeping."" When CNN interviewed Baines two years ago, she was asked to explain why she thought she has lived so long. ""God. Ask him. I took good care of myself, the way he wanted me to,"" Baines said. Her only child, a daughter, died of typhoid fever at age 18. Much of her long life was lived in Ohio, where she worked as a ""house mom"" at a state university. She eventually divorced and traveled to Los Angeles, where she retired. Baines will not officially be given the title until after Guinness World Records completes an investigation, the organization said. ""Maria was crowned the world's Oldest Living Woman by Guinness World Records on 28 December upon the death of Edna Parker,"" the group said.

"San Francisco, California (CNN) -- They've been committed to each other for eight years and have four sons together, but there's a component missing in one Berkeley, California, couple's life that's out of reach for them: getting married. Kristin Perry and Sandra Stier's partnership is one that has taken center stage because of the ongoing debate on same-sex marriage in California. On Monday, the spotlight will be even brighter, when a trial challenging California's Proposition 8, which bans same-sex marriage, begins in U. S. District Court in San Francisco. Demonstrators are expected to be out in force. Plans had been made to have a camera in the courtroom, and the proceedings distrubuted on YouTube, but the ballot initiative's sponsors prevailed in their 11th-hour bid to persuade the U.S. Supreme Court to restrict distribution of video of the trial -- at least temporarily. The justices wrote in their terse order that they need until at least Wednesday afternoon to consider the camera issue. Perry and Stier, along with Jeffrey Zarrillo and Paul Katami, of Los Angeles, are the two couples at the heart of the case, arguing that California's ban on gay marriage is unconstitutional. They are asking Chief Judge Vaughn R. Walker to issue an injunction against Proposition 8's enforcement. The case will likely head to the U.S. Supreme Court no matter what the outcome. It is expected to set legal precedents that will shape society for years to come and result in a landmark court decision that settles whether Americans can marry people of the same sex. Do you think Prop 8 is constitutional? In legal circles and across the Internet, it has been dubbed this generation's Brown v. Board of Education, the case that led to the Supreme Court decision that outlawed segregation in schools. Some say it could be the biggest ruling since Roe v. Wade, which tackled abortion. It also closely echoes the Supreme Court case that overturned bans on interracial marriage. The debate over Proposition 8 has been fueled by emotions on both sides. For Perry and Stier, Zarrillo and Katami and their supporters, the issue is simple. They say the case boils down to nothing more than equal protection under the law and that their sexual orientation should not prevent them from getting married. ""It does not weaken the fabric of our communities to grant them these basic familial rights -- it strengthens them,"" said Chad Griffin, President of the American Foundation for Equal Rights, when the lawsuit was announced in May. ""It does not undermine marriage to extend to these loving couples -- it affirms it."" ""This is one of the threshold civil rights issues of our generation,"" he said. ""Justice is on our side and we're about to reclaim it."" Representing them are two high-powered attorneys, Ted Olson and David Boies. They're an unlikely pair -- former courtroom adversaries best known for being on opposing sides of the ""hanging chad"" dispute of the 2000 presidential election in Florida. Olson, a staunch political conservative who defended the government's positions as solicitor general, was a choice that surprised many supporters of the case for same-sex marriage.  He said there's nothing inconsistent about him fighting for the rights of same-sex couples. ""They call it a teaching moment these days,"" he said. ""This gives us an opportunity to explain how wrong it has been to deny rights to individuals on that basis."" Republican California Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger and the state's Democratic Attorney General Jerry Brown are defendants in the lawsuit because of their positions in California government. However, both have said they would not defend the suit. Brown filed a legal motion saying he agreed with the position advanced by Olson and Boies. Schwarzenegger has taken no position. Andrew Pugno, a lawyer for an organization called Protect Marriage, the group that came up with Proposition 8, said he believes the issue was solved when the people of California made their voices heard in the voting booth. ""Seven million Californians voted to preserve or restore what marriage has meant since the beginning of time,"" he said. ""If they're not permitted to do something as basic as that, then there's something, really something, wrong with our system."" For Pugno and supporters on his side of the issue, keeping the definition of marriage as a union between a man and a woman is what makes sense. ""Marriage legally and socially has always been a social public institution that affects far more than the adults involved,"" he said. ""We are taking a position that society has a very good reason for limiting marriage the way it does. ... The relationship of a man and woman bears a relationship to child-rearing that no other relationship can duplicate."" The Proposition 8 vote is part of a long line of seesaw rulings, court cases, debates and protests in California over the issue. After California's Legislature approved same-sex marriages, voters took to the polls in November 2008; a slim majority -- 52 percent -- approved of banning the marriages. In May 2009, California's highest court upheld the ban, but allowed about 18,000 unions performed before the ban to remain valid. For same-sex couples, especially those who did not get married before the ban, the ruling was hardly comforting. Several liberal celebrity activists, led by former director and actor Rob Reiner, have bankrolled the first federal challenge to the voter-approved ban on gay marriage. The nation's eyes will be on the court's eventual ruling. Olson and Boies said they believe the case is simple based on their reading of the U.S. Constitution. ""The first thing to think about is the right to marry is a fundamental right in the United States,"" Olsen said. ""It's a right protected by the Constitution. The Supreme Court has held over and over again that it may be one of the most fundamental rights to unite with the person you love to form a partnership."" For Boies, the case follows a sad tradition in American history: the denial of rights to people because certain groups blindly see them as undeserving. ""This lawsuit is about the courts saying no matter how blind people may be, the Constitution guarantees that everyone deserves the equal rights that every human being is entitled to,"" Boies said. ""And we go to court because that is the place those equal rights have been established time and again over the last 100 years.""

"New York (CNN) -- Peter Madoff, brother of Bernard Madoff and chief compliance officer of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities, is the subject of a criminal investigation, the U.S. attorney's office in New York confirmed Thursday. In a letter filed this week in federal court in Newark, New Jersey, Peter Madoff's attorney, Charles Spada, says that the investigation was the reason that his client invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination at a deposition in a related case in November. Spada said he had been informed of the investigation into Peter Madoff's involvement in his brother's Ponzi scheme a week before the deposition, at which Peter Madoff declined to answer more than 290 questions. ""Given the circumstances and intensity of the criminal investigation, one can hardly question defendant's constitutional right not to answer questions about his brother, Bernard Madoff, his work at BLMIS ... and virtually any related topic for fear that such answers might 'furnish a link in the chain of evidence' for a criminal prosecution,"" Spada said in the letter to Judge Madeline Cox Arleo. The deposition was for a lawsuit brought against Peter Madoff by the Lautenberg Foundation, which says it lost all of its investment with Madoff Investment Securities: $7 million that the firm told the foundation had grown to an estimated $15 million. Spada's letter was filed in response to the foundation's move to have Madoff sanctioned for failing to be ""cooperative"" in the deposition. The attorney says the Lautenberg Foundation -- a charitable private group headed by Sen. Frank Lautenberg -- is an effort to ""unfairly jump ahead of thousands of other investors"" who also are seeking damages from Madoff Investment Securities. A separate lawsuit has been filed on behalf of all the business's investors, who have lost an estimated $200 million in the scheme. In March, Bernard Madoff pleaded guilty to 11 counts related to running the most massive Ponzi scheme in history and was sentenced to 150 years in prison. CNN's Jean Shin contributed to this report.","Peter Madoff is chief compliance officer of Bernard L. Madoff Investment Securities .

"(CNN) -- Authorities are investigating six possible cases of bacterial meningitis -- including two deaths -- in rural Oklahoma elementary school students. The Rogers County Health Department and Oklahoma State Department of Health said two children from Oologah-Talala public school district have died from the disease. One of them was an 8-year-old, said Superintendent Rick Thomas. Thomas said school was canceled Friday for the district. ""We just feel like we would rather err on the side of caution,"" he said, although he has urged parents to remain calm. The state health board said it was providing antibiotics to the schools to help prevent the spread of meningococcal disease -- caused by the bacteria Neisseria meningitidis -- which can appear as pneumonia, septicemia or meningitis. Meningitis is a disease caused by the inflammation of the meninges, the thin lining that surrounds the brain and the spinal cord, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A medical team at Oologah Lower Elementary School screened more than 100 people including faculty, CNN affiliate KOTV reported. Authorities said the team is offering antibiotics to other students and faculty in the district, and there is enough medication for about 1,000 people, the affiliate reported. Last year, 16 cases of meningococcal disease were reported in Oklahoma and one person died, the board said. Symptoms of meningococcal disease may appear two to 10 days after infection, but typically within three to four days, the state board said. People ill with meningococcal septicemia may have fever, nausea, vomiting and a rash, it said. Those with meningitis will have fever, intense headache, nausea, vomiting and a stiff neck. ""It is important to seek care from a physician as soon as possible if these symptoms appear,"" the board said.

"(CNN) -- Two British soldiers and a Spanish soldier were killed in separate incidents in Afghanistan, the British and Spanish Defense Ministries said. The British soldiers died in roadside bomb explosions Monday, a part of southern Afghanistan that has been the site of fierce fighting between the Taliban and coalition troops, the ministry said in a written statement. The soldiers were on foot patrol at the time, said Lt. Col. David Wakefield, a spokesman for Task Force Helmand, a predominantly British military command that conducts operations in Helmand province. They were identified as belonging to the 3rd Battalion, The Yorkshire Regiment but were not identified by name. In the other Monday incident, a Spanish military vehicle struck a mine while on a mission to distribute aid, and the explosion killed one soldier and wounded six others, a Spanish Defense Ministry spokesman told CNN. Killed was a Colombian national, Jon Felipe Romero Meneses, in his early twenties, serving with Spain's armed forces. The identities and conditions of the wounded soldiers were not immediately available, said the spokeswoman, who by custom is not identified. The blast happened in Qala-i-Naw province in Afghanistan, where the Spanish troops were escorting a U.N. World Food Programme convoy to distribute aid. Spain has more than 800 troops in Afghanistan serving in the NATO-led mission, and the government has recently committed to send several hundred more, partly in response to the Obama administration's request for more troops from allied nations. Spain has had troops in Afghanistan since 2002, and more than 22 Spanish soldiers have died there, including two in November 2008 when a suicide bomber rammed their convoy, and 17 in a helicopter crash in August 2005.

"JAKARTA, Indonesia (CNN) -- Another strong earthquake rocked Indonesia early Thursday as the Southeast Asian nation was reeling from an earlier jolt that killed more than 200 people. A resident stands next to building that collapsed onto a car in Padang, Indonesia, on Wednesday. The 6.8 magnitude quake Thursday hit southern Sumatra at 8:52 a.m. local time (0152 GMT), the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. Wednesday's earlier quake was 7.6 magnitude. At least 236 people are dead and more than 500 injured, the Indonesian Social Ministry's Crisis Center said Thursday. It said it had little information on the missing and feared the death toll would climb into the thousands. The second quake was on a smaller scale than the first, said meteorology official Fauzi, who uses only one name. There were no damage reports yet. Indonesian Health Minister Siti Fadilah Supari expected ""the casualties and the damage of this earthquake to be bigger than the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake, given the intensity and the spread of the damage."" The magnitude-6.3 Yogyakarta quake in central Java in May 2006 killed more than 5,000 people, triggered fears of an eruption of a nearby volcano and caused significant damage to a 9th century Prambanan temple. Thousands may be trapped by collapsed buildings and houses, Rustam Pakaya, the head of the Health Ministry's crisis center, told CNN on Wednesday. State-run Antara news agency cited Pakaya as saying he had received reports that part of a hospital had collapsed and that people were buried under the debris. The temblor struck around 5 p.m., about 33 miles (53 kilometers) from Padang, the capital city of West Sumatra and home to more than 800,000 people. The quake caused widespread power and phone outages, making it difficult to assess damage. Aid agencies kicked into gear to help those in need. ""We had aid ready because this area of Indonesia is susceptible to this type of tragedy,"" said Jane Cocking, humanitarian director for Oxfam. ""Communications with the quake-zone are difficult and we are hoping for the best but having to plan for the worst."" ""The situation is quite devastating,"" said Amelia Merrick, the operations director for World Vision Indonesia. ""Bridges have gone down, phone lines are in total disrepair. It's difficult for us to assess the situation,"" she said. The organization had said it would send assessment teams to the area Thursday morning. ""We know there's no electricity tonight... many of the families will be spending the night outdoors, in pitch black. I'm very afraid of what might happen next,"" she said, referring to the possibility of aftershocks. Hundreds of houses have been damaged, Wayne Ulrich, the Red Cross disaster management coordinator in Indonesia, told CNN. ""We do not know the [exact] numbers."" ""We have concerns that a hospital has been partially damaged, a market has caught on fire, the airport was closed down for inspection because of the fear if they landed any planes,"" it might cause problems, Ulrich said.  Watch Ulrich discuss the rescue efforts » . Access to the affected areas was obstructed in parts, he added. It's ""blocked by all kinds of problems: frightened people out in the streets, cars, and people trying to get out of the city."" The earthquake was felt in nearby cities, such as Medan and Bengkulu, where people panicked and ran outside in search of higher ground, fearing a tsunami. But it was also felt as far away as Singapore and Malaysia. ""I did feel the tremor in office today somewhere between 5 - 6 p.m.,"" said Ratna Osman, who works in a single-story office building in Petaling Jaya, just outside Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur. ""I asked [a co-worker] if there's an earthquake somewhere -- either that or I was hallucinating."" ""At first, I thought the chair I was sitting on had a screw loose or something,"" Osman said. The region is accustomed to earthquakes, and locals have been taught to identify safe places in case of a tsunami, according to Sean Granville-Ross, the Mercy Corps country director for Indonesia. ""We hope that preparation is now paying off,"" he said. But if many homes have been destroyed, people may be spending the night with no shelter, he said. Earlier this month, an earthquake in West Java killed 57 people. Several buildings were damaged, Metro TV reported, and people were seen running out of their homes and toward the hills. One employee of a private company in Jalan Ahmad Yani, told Antara news agency that ""everybody panicked with some shouting 'earthquake.'"" TVOne pictures from the scene showed people milling around outside in the city. Phone lines were apparently down in many parts of Padang. Indonesia's Tempo Interactive, a media outlet based in Jakarta, had trouble reaching its correspondent in the West Sumatra city, according to journalist Purwani Diyah Prabandari. ""I hope it's just the cell phone connection,"" Prabandari told CNN. Indonesians trying to find out more about the quake flooded the Internet, including Twitter. Some expressed concern for relatives and friends in Padang. ""Dear God, please send down your angels to hug and protect my grandpa in Padang,"" said one Twitter post. The Web site for one of Indonesia's main newspapers, The Jakarta Globe, crashed for a while, partly as a result of the heavy traffic from people trying to find out about the quake, the paper said in a Twitter post. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) issued a tsunami watch for Indonesia, India, Thailand and Malaysia, but canceled it soon after. The temblor did generate a tsunami just under one foot high, the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. On Tuesday, a magnitude 8.0 quake-triggered tsunami killed at least 111 people in the Samoan islands and Tonga. Read latest news on the Samoa quake and tsunami . The tsunami waves swept across a wide swath of the Pacific Ocean, killing dozens and flattening or submerging villages. The dead included 22 in American Samoa, 82 in Samoa and seven in Tonga. Officials warned that the death toll could rise as rescue workers start to reach outlying villages and discover new casualties. The U.S. Geological Survey declined to say whether the two quakes were linked. ""The simple answer is we can't speculate on a connection,"" Carrieann Bedwell of the USGS told CNN. ""Both are in highly seismic areas."" The epicenters of the two temblors are about 4,700 miles (7,600 km) apart.

"(CNN) -- President Obama's foreign policy agenda may have ""run out of steam"" and he must now take risks and provide effective leadership, former U.S. National Security Adviser Zbigniew Brzezinski said Friday. In an interview with CNN's Christiane Amanpour, Brzezinski said Obama's foreign policy agenda is suffering from gridlock in Washington. ""I have the feeling that because of domestic problems, he has run out of steam, and I don't know really how determined he is to resume what he started doing so well, which is to engage the world constructively,"" Brzezinski said. Brzezinski, who is now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said the only way to break the stalemate is for Obama to take the lead. The president can show leadership, he said, by ""persuasively going to the country directly, mobilizing the support, taking on some difficult foreign challenge, and prevailing."" Brzezinski cited Iran as an example of key challenges Obama ought to tackle. Obama should not ""abandon it prematurely,"" he said, noting the complexities of the internal Iranian situation could give the United States ""room for maneuver, and perhaps some basis for expecting an eventual partial accommodation."" Brzezinski also cited the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as a key challenge because it ""revolutionizes, radicalizes the Middle East, and maximizes the number of enemies the United States has."" Asked how he would grade the Obama administration's performance on Iran and the Middle East, he said, ""Well, rhetorically, A; in terms of performance, B, B-minus."" Despite the United States' foreign policy problems, Brzezinski said, the nation has the resources to deal with new global security threats in cyberspace, outer space and on the high seas. Brzezinski also commented on the newly published 2010 Quadrennial Defense Review, a legislatively mandated review of the U.S. Department of Defense strategy and priorities. The review is meant ""to assess the threats and challenges that the nation faces,"" and to ""rebalance the department's strategies, capabilities and forces to address today's conflicts and tomorrow's threats,"" according to the Department of Defense. Brzezinski warned even though the United States has highly sophisticated technology, it also has to be effective in global diplomacy, adding, ""We have neglected that in the course of the last decade."" ""I think we have to redefine the nature of the enemy,"" Brzezinski said, ""the global security context in which we find ourselves is now fundamentally different."" Brzezinski, national security adviser during the Carter administration between 1977 and 1981, noted how the new threats differ from those of the Cold War. ""When I was in the White House, the threat was concentrated and very lethal,"" he said. ""You know, the Soviet Union, in case of a central war with the United States, could kill roughly 80 million Americans in six hours."" Today, Brzezinski said, the United States has ""a lot of threats, ranging from terrorists to rogue states to unpredictable events. And that makes the defense issue more complex, even though it is somewhat rather less lethal."" He cited the example of cyberattacks. ""Are these hackers, for example, from China working for the Chinese government or are they working for some private business? What are their motives?"" He said it is vital for the United States to have the capability not only to stop hacking, but to retaliate as well.","President can stop stalemate by taking risks, showing leadership, Zbigniew Brzezinski says .

"Washington (CNN) -- A lesbian couple together for more than a decade smiled through tears Tuesday as they became the first same-sex couple to marry in the District of Columbia, on the first day such unions are legal in the nation's capital. Sinjoyla Townsend and Angelisa Young said they had waited years to marry. They were first in line last week to apply for a marriage license at Washington's marriage bureau. ""You are my friend, my partner, my love,"" Young, 47, told Townsend, 41. ""I will love you today, tomorrow and forever."" After the wedding, those present cheered as the two women embraced and cried. They have been together for 12 years and have children, according to biographical information released by the Human Rights Campaign and D.C. Clergy United for Marriage Equality. The new law survived a Supreme Court challenge. The measure went into effect last week, but couples had to hold off until Tuesday because of the district's three-day waiting period. ""We're very excited,"" Townsend said last week. She and Young were among 100 couples applying for licenses. Share your thoughts on same-sex marriage . The district joins Connecticut, Iowa, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Vermont in allowing same-sex couples to marry.

It then went through a review period, during which Congress had an opportunity to intervene. The Supreme Court last week rejected a request from a group of Washington residents to keep the law from going into effect. Local courts had previously turned down lawsuits to block it. Opponents of the law say city residents should have had a chance to vote on the issue before the city council passed it. They hope to force a ballot initiative to overturn the law. Also among the first couples to marry Tuesday were Reggie Stanley and Rocky Galloway, both 50. The couple have two daughters, Malena and Zoe Stanley-Galloway, each 15 months old, according to the biographical information released by the equality groups. Also married on Tuesday were the Rev.

"(CNN)  -- World number one Roger Federer is suffering from a lung infection and has pulled out of this week's $2 million ATP tournament in Dubai. Australian Open champion Federer is set to be sidelined for up to six weeks and may not return to action until a big hard court event in the United States in March. Federer, who won his 16th grand slam when beating Britain's Andy Murray in Melbourne, has been advised by a doctor not to play for at least a fortnight. He is set to play at the Masters Series event at Indian Wells which starts on March 11, but may have to wait until the following tournament in Miami. ""There are no guarantees that I will play at Indian Wells -- this could be a maximum of six weeks, but if it's treated properly everything should be fine and I should be back fairly quickly,"" he told the official ATP Tour Web site.

"Kettleman City, California (CNN)  -- Spring in California's San Joaquin Valley is seemingly idyllic, with rolling hills and miles of fruit orchards. But what's happening in the small town of Kettleman City has people scared. In the past three years, 10 babies in Kettleman City, California, have been born with birth defects, including cleft palates and heart problems. Four cases were reported in 2008 and there was another possible case that same year.   According to the California Department of Public Health and California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, those four cases in Kettleman City are higher than expected. Nationally, the Birth Defects Monitoring Program lists one out of every 33 babies as born with a birth defect. Three infants have died, including Maria Saucedo's daughter, Ashley. ""It's such a small town and such a large problem. We want to give our children life, not death,"" said Saucedo. ""When Ashley was born, the doctors told me that there was something wrong with her. They told me that Ashley wouldn't live more than one or two months."" Despite a weak immune system, Ashley managed to live for almost 10 months. She died of a blood infection on January 24, 2009. Through tears, Saucedo said, ""I apologized for not taking her earlier to the hospital, but the doctors told me that it wasn't my fault, that with babies like this, this is what happens."" But Saucedo wants to know why it happened to her and the other mothers living here. Kettleman City is one of the poorest towns in the state. Maricela Mares Alatorre, who works as a teacher, grew up there. ""It's a really small town,"" said Alatorre. ""Most people have been here for generations. I like to call it the Mayberry feeing with a Latino twist."" But unlike Mayberry, the 1,500 people of this farming community have no grocery store, no high school and few sidewalks. The town, which is surrounded by farms, is polluted. It is plagued with poor air quality, unsafe drinking water and exposure to pesticides. Kettleman City's water does not meet EPA standards, because of  high levels of naturally occurring arsenic. . The state and EPA have found poor air quality throughout the San Joaquin Valley. Kettleman City is surrounded by agriculture and is exposed to heavy use of pesticides. Because of its location right off Highway 41, there also is a lot of emissions pollution. The major concern for many people in Kettleman City, however, lies just four miles outside town. It is the largest toxic waste site west of the Mississippi. The site is operated by the waste disposal firm Waste Management, which said that last year 400,000 tons of hazardous waste -- including lead and cancer-linked PCBs found in plastics -- was dumped there. Every day, hundreds of trucks pour in and out. Some residents believe the birth defects could be linked to the waste site. Waste Management has said its Kettleman Hills facility operates safely and fully protects human health and the environment. The site has been inspected by four separate local, state and federal entities since 2007. All concluded the facility operates safely and does not affect local residents. Waste Management has agreed to cooperate with investigations into the community's concerns.  Tension between Waste Management and the community goes back decades. Residents led by the Rev. Jesse Jackson waged a battle against Waste Management in 1991 to stop a toxic waste incinerator from being built. They won. Now the residents of Kettleman City are fighting again, this time over a proposed waste site expansion, for which their local officials voted. For Alatorre, environmental activism is in her genes. ""I'm a second-generation activist,"" she said. Alatorre has been fighting against the waste site expansion and fighting for a state health investigation into the birth defects for nearly two years. She and others are upset that the county voted to expand the waste site before a full investigation was completed. ""We don't want an expansion because we feel like there are a lot of health problems in town and we're not necessarily attributing it to the dump, but we feel like with all of the other environmental factors we face, why add more to it?"" In December, the Kings County board asked the state for a health investigation into the birth defects, but one week later they voted in favor of granting a permit to allow the waste site to expand. Ingrid Brostrom, an attorney with the Center on Race, Poverty and the Environment, said, ""If there is any potential that these birth defects are caused by environmental contaminants, then we shouldn't be introducing any new contaminants. There should not be an expansion of the existing hazardous waste dump. It is essential the county knows what is causing these birth defects before the hazardous waste site can be expanded."" Activists and residents have filed a lawsuit against Kings County in an effort to stop the waste site expansion. In a press release, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger's office said he has ""directed his State Department of Public Health and Environmental Protection Agency to expand their investigation into what could be causing an abnormal percentage of birth defects in the small farming town."" For Saucedo and the other mothers of Kettleman City, an investigation can't come soon enough. ""I want a response and I want it quickly. Nobody's given us any answers and children continue to be born sick,"" said Saucedo.","In 3 years, 10 babies in Kettleman City, California, have been born with birth defects .

"MEXICO CITY, Mexico (CNN)  -- What do software mogul Bill Gates and banking investor Warren Buffett have in common with wanted Mexican drug lord Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera? Joaquin ""El Chapo"" Guzman Loera, pictured in 1993, ranks 701st on Forbes' yearly report on billionaires. They are all featured in Forbes magazine's world's billionaires report as ""self-made"" billionaires. Guzman Loera, whose nickname means Shorty, escaped from a Mexican prison in 2001. He heads the powerful Sinaloa cartel, investigators say. Authorities on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border blame the Sinaloa and other cartels for a surge in violence in the region. He ranked 701st on Forbes' yearly report, with an estimated fortune of $1 billion. Mexican Attorney General Eduardo Medina Mora expressed outrage at the publication and described Forbes' calculations on Guzman Loera's fortune as mere ""speculation."" ""I will never accept that a criminal could be recognized as someone distinguished, even if it is by a magazine like Forbes,"" Medina Mora said to local media during a drug traffic summit Thursday in Vienna, Austria. Forbes is ""comparing the deplorable activity of a criminal wanted in Mexico and abroad with that of honest businessmen,"" he said. Mexican President Felipe Calderon -- speaking at a business summit Thursday in Mexico City -- alluded to the report, saying, ""It is very sad the intensification of a campaign, which seems to me, has been launched against Mexico."" Calderon added, ""Public opinion and now even magazines not only attack and lie about the situation in Mexico, but now also praise criminals. In Mexico, it is considered a crime to praise criminals.""  Guzman Loera has a three-decade history of drug trade spanning North, Central and South America.

"(CNN) -- An Organization of American States commission condemned Monday the slayings last month of three Honduran political activists opposed to a military-led coup that removed the elected president in June. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also said it deplores the kidnappings, arbitrary detentions, torture, sexual violations and illegal raids that the panel maintains other members of the political resistance have suffered since the June 29 coup. The commission cited more than 50 detentions, eight cases of torture, two kidnappings, two rapes and one raid on a residence during the past month. The attacks have been made against members of the resistance, union members and journalists, as well as their children, the panel said. Honduras returned to democracy in January, and the newly installed government of President Porfirio Lobo Sosa bears responsibility for safeguarding civil liberties and human rights, the commission said. ""Honduras must adopt urgent measures to guarantee the rights to life, humane treatment and personal liberty,"" the panel said in a report. ""All persons, without distinction, must be equally protected in the exercise of their rights to freedom of expression, assembly, and political participation."" Honduras' top law enforcement official said he ""laments and deplores"" violence that resulted from the coup that removed President Jose Manuel Zelaya from power and installed interim President Roberto Micheletti. ""We will strengthen our investigations aimed at clearing up these events, appointing a special squad that will produce the arrests of those responsible and the unrestricted application of justice,"" Minister of Security Oscar Arturo Alvarez Guerrero said last week. Micheletti instituted martial law during his seven-month rule, and some Zelaya supporters say they were harassed, arrested or worse. Human rights will be respected under Lobo, who was elected in November and assumed the presidency January 27, national Police Commissioner Leonel Sauceda said Monday. Alvarez has been in office for only about a month but has promised to tackle the problem, Sauceda said. The OAS commission said that one of the recently killed activists was 29-year-old Vanessa Zepeda Alonzo, who was found February 3. According to the panel, witnesses said her body was thrown out of a car. Another activist, union member Julio Funez Benitez, was chatting outside his home in Olancho on February 15 when two men on a motorcycle fatally shot him twice, the rights commission said. A third person, Claudia Maritza Brizuela, 36, was killed in her home February 24, the commission said. She was the daughter of union and community leader Pedro Brizuela, who participated against the coup. ""Two unknown individuals came to her door, and when she opened it, Claudia Brizuela was shot and killed in front of her children, ages 2 and 8,"" the report said. The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights also expressed concern that activists' family members are being threatened and harassed, with two of them killed in the past few weeks. ""The commission observes with dismay that it appears that sons and daughters of leaders of the Resistance Front are being killed, kidnapped, attacked and threatened as a strategy to silence the activists,"" the report said. Dara Gudiel, 17, was found hanged February 17 in Danli, the commission said. She was the daughter of journalist Enrique Gudiel, who broadcasts the resistance radio program ""Siempre al Frente con el Frente"" (""Always Up Front with the Front""). ""Days before she was found hanged, Dara Gudiel had been released after having been kidnapped and held for two days, during which time she was alleged to have been physically mistreated,"" the panel's report said. Eight days earlier, the commission said, seven heavily armed men dressed in military uniforms and wearing ski masks abducted five members of a family active in the resistance. One of those taken captive, the panel said, was a young woman who reported in August being raped by four police officers who detained her in connection with an anti-coup demonstration. In the February 9 abduction, the armed men intercepted the vehicle in which the young woman was traveling with her brother, her sister and two other people. When the occupants offered to turn over the car keys, the report said, the men answered that they wanted the young woman, ""to see if she would report them this time."" ""The five were forced at gunpoint to walk into the mountains, where two of the women were sexually violated; the third was the victim of robbery and death threats, and the two men were subjected to physical torture,"" the report said. ""They were released hours later."" Analysts note that violence is not new to Honduras, nor is it limited in scope. The violence can be political, from all sides of the spectrum. It can be criminal, either random or organized. And it can occur in urban or rural areas. ""Unfortunately, Honduras has a history of violence,"" said Otto Reich, who served the past three Republican presidents in a number of high-level Latin American posts. A State Department advisory admonishes that ""crime is endemic in Honduras and requires a high degree of caution by U.S. visitors and residents alike. U.S. citizens have been the victims of a wide range of crimes, including murder, kidnapping, rape, assault and property crimes."" Poverty, gangs and low apprehension and conviction rates contribute to a critical crime rate, including mass slayings, the State Department said. But political violence deserves special attention to safeguard democracy, the OAS panel said. ""People from all political sectors have the right to fully and freely exercise their right to freedom of expression and their right to assembly, without violence and in accordance with the law and with inter-American standards for the protection of human rights,"" the report said. Reich, who supported Micheletti, spent three days in Honduras last week and met with Lobo, the new president. The new administration, Reich said, is committed to reconciliation and putting an end to divisions that resulted from the coup. Micheletti and the coup plotters maintained that Zelaya was trying to remain in power by maneuvering to hold a referendum that ultimately could have allowed him to run again. The nation's congress had outlawed the vote, and the supreme court said it was unconstitutional. Reich said he hopes the OAS report does not blame the new government for the violence. But the report bears noting, he said. ""Any allegation of violations of human rights has to be taken very seriously, especially in a country with a history of human rights violations,"" Reich said. ""There's a lot of ad hoc violence, but if there's organized violence against political supporters of Zelaya, then that is wrong, and it should be condemned."" The Inter-American Commission on Human Rights is an autonomous panel created by the OAS. The commission consists of seven independent members who act in a personal capacity, without representing a particular country. They are elected by the OAS General Assembly.","Organization of American States panel targets kidnappings, torture, raids .

"(CNN) -- Three men were sentenced to prison for forcing an African-American man out of a South Carolina convenience store, threatening him with a chainsaw and stealing his car, an incident the Department of Justice said was fueled by hate. Thomas Blue Sr., 49, owner of the convenience store, was sentenced Tuesday to 13 years in prison in the 2007 incident. A second man, Judson Hartley Talbert, was sentenced to nine years, the department said. Blue's son, Thomas Blue Jr., 29, was sentenced to three years. The three pleaded guilty in December to conspiring to deprive and depriving Dahndra ""Ervin"" Moore of his right to engage in a federally protected activity -- entering the convenience store -- and also to conspiring to carjack and carjacking his car, authorities said. The elder Blue also pleaded guilty to depriving two other people, both white, of their right to engage in a federally protected activity and using a firearm in relation to a crime of violence against those two. The defendants admitted that the elder Blue ""forcibly escorted"" Moore out of a Marlboro County, South Carolina, store known as the Stop and Shop after he entered to use the restroom, the statement said. ""Once outside, the elder Blue forced the victim to the ground and Blue Jr. threatened the victim with a chainsaw while a small crowd watched,"" according to the Department of Justice statement. While the attack was occurring, Talbert stole Moore's car, authorities said. Later, the elder Blue used a pistol to threaten two white men who he thought were trying to help the victim, including one who showed up to retrieve Moore's car. All three men waived their right to appeal, according to court documents. The elder Blue's attorney, Jack Swirling, called the incident ""most unfortunate"" and ""totally unacceptable."" His client, he said, is very remorseful, adding that the incident would not have occurred but for Blue's heavy drinking that day. Kirk Truslow, the younger Blue's attorney, said his client had apologized to Moore and his family and ""wishes this never would have happened."" The case ""went a long way in making some changes in the area,"" he said. ""I think it really made an impact,"" Truslow said. ""Everyone in this area took notice."" Talbert's attorney, Morgan Martin, called the incident ""regrettable"" and said his client is sorry it happened. ""This case is a reminder that violent acts fueled by bigotry and hate continue to happen all too frequently in our nation, even in 2010,"" said Thomas Perez, assistant attorney general in charge of the Justice Department's civil rights division. ""This senseless, terrifying assault was quite simply the product of hate,"" said Kevin McDonald, acting U.S. attorney for the District of South Carolina. ""I expect others tempted to act out in violent racism to take note of this prosecution and the sentences imposed.""","3 convicted for the 2007 attack at a store in South Carolina .

"Port-au-Prince, Haiti (CNN)  -- Long lines formed under the watchful eye of American and multinational troops as a wide-scale food distribution effort reached capacity Thursday in Port-au-Prince, Haiti. Nearly 160,000 Haitian women each collected a 25-kilogram (55 pounds) bag of rice under a distribution plan coordinated by the United Nations, several private humanitarian agencies and the Haitian government. The effort was launched Sunday but not all 16 fixed distribution points around the capital were operational until Thursday. So far, 600,000 people affected by the devastating January 12 earthquake have been able to collect food under this plan, said Marcus Prior, spokesman for the United Nations World Food Programme. ""We're encouraged by the way the system is working to get food out into the city to those in need, but still have a long way to go,"" Prior said. Only women were given food coupons beforehand and allowed to stand in line to collect for their families. ""Our long experience in food distribution tells us that by delivering food into the hands of women, it is more likely to be redistributed equitably among the household -- including the men,"" Prior said. U.S. and U.N. troops have been keeping strict control over the crowds. Prior said the distribution plan has been orderly so far. The death toll from the earthquake has reached 212,000, Prime Minister Jean-Max Bellerive said Thursday. More than 300,000 people were injured and more than 1 million were made homeless, he told CNN's ""Larry King Live.""","United Nations, humanitarian agencies, Haitian government sponsor program .

"(CNN)  -- Within the last month, our country has witnessed two senseless, high-profile acts of criminal violence that would have been labeled terrorism if brown-skinned Arab Muslim men with foreign-sounding names had committed them. Because two white men committed these acts of violence, however, our political and media chattering class never used the word ""terrorism"" in its discussions. Most recently, John Patrick Bedell, a 36-year-old man from California, walked up to two security guards outside the Pentagon Metro station in suburban Washington and started shooting. He was then shot and killed. According to The Christian Science Monitor, Bedell appeared ""to have been a right-wing extremist with virulent anti-government feelings"" and also battled mental illness before his shooting rampage. A few weeks ago, on February 18, another white anti-government extremist named Joseph Stack flew his small airplane into an Internal Revenue Service building in Austin, Texas,  killing two people and injuring 13 others. According to media reports, Stack had left behind a disjointed suicide letter in which he expressed his hatred of our American government and outlined grievances with the IRS, chillingly stating that ""violence not only is the answer; it is the only answer."" Both the Pentagon Metro and IRS attacks come at a time of ""explosive growth in [domestic] extremist-group activism across the United States,"" according to the Southern Poverty Law Center. A recently released law center report showed so-called patriot groups -- steeped in anti-government conspiracy theories -- grew from 149 in 2008 to 512 in 2009 -- a 244 percent increase that the Southern Poverty Law Center report judged to be an ""astonishing"" rise in the one-year period since President Obama took the oath of office. The number of these groups that are domestic extremist paramilitary militias grew from 42 in 2008 to 127 in 2009, the report said. Even so, for any reasonable observer who is still skeptical about labeling the recent Pentagon area shooting and IRS attack terrorism, keep one thing in mind: . Let us imagine that these Pentagon and IRS attacks had been committed by an olive-skinned Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad. Our national media and political commentators would have wasted little time in calling both of these acts terrorism, and some might have also called for the closings of other IRS and federal government office buildings around the country as a necessary counter-terrorism safety precaution. Instead, shortly after the IRS plane attack, some prominent media commentators immediately asked why people -- especially conservatives on the right -- were not calling the IRS attacker a terrorist. ""If this had been done by a brownish-looking Muslim guy whose suicide note paralleled Islamist political themes,"" wrote media commentator Matthew Yglesias, then right-wingers would ""demand that anyone who refused to label the attack 'terrorism' be put up on treason charges."" In a recent piece, Robert Wright, of the New America Foundation, wrote: ""In common usage, a 'terrorist' is someone who attacks in the name of a political cause and aims to spread terror -- to foster fear that such attacks will be repeated until grievances are addressed."" Following suit, the IRS attacker's suicide manifesto  before his aerial kamikaze attack reads in part: ""I know there have been countless before me and there are sure to be as many after ... I can only hope that the numbers quickly get too big to be whitewashed and ignored"" -- at which point, God willing, -- ""the American zombies wake up and revolt."" If this same above-mentioned suicide letter had been instead written by an Arab Muslim man named Ali Muhammad right before crashing his airplane into an IRS building, most of the right-wing blogosphere would instantaneously erupt with screaming headlines of another act of Muslim terrorism. Because Theodore Kaczynski, the Unabomber; Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh; Atlanta, Georgia,  Olympic bomber Eric Rudolph; the Pentagon shooter and IRS attacker were all white men motivated by their respective ideologies, surprisingly, the term ""terrorism"" has never seemed to stick to any of them. To prove my point even further, the recently indicted American woman Colleen LaRose, who called herself ""Jihad Jane,"" can rightfully be termed a wanna-be terrorist. But why does this not apply to other white extremists? If our nation is truly conducting a ''war on terror'' and not a ""war on Islam,"" it is our duty as Americans of all colors, political persuasions and nationalities to condemn and distance ourselves from all acts of terrorism, regardless of the race or religion of those who commit violent acts in the name of extreme ideology. Simply put, terrorism is terrorism, whether it is committed by a white, black or brown person anywhere in the world. If we as a nation fail to adequately condemn all acts of terrorism equally, the only clear message that we will be sending to the rest of the world is that the word ""terrorist"" applies only to those with olive skin and foreign-sounding last names. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Arsalan Iftikhar.","Arsalan Iftikhar: Imagine if recent violent acts had been committed by Arab Muslim men .

"(CNN) -- World No. 2 Dinara Safina has been forced to pull out of next week's Dubai Tennis Championships due to her ongoing back problems. The Russian announced on her Web site that she had been suffering from the injury since last year. ""Unfortunately, I will not be able to play the Barclays Dubai Tennis Championships this year because of the back injury that's been bothering me since the end of last season,"" the 23-year-old said. ""I wish the tournament the best of success on its 10th anniversary and hope to be back next year, as it's one of my favorite events."" Safina lost her No. 1 ranking for the second time after retiring hurt during her first match at the season-ending Sony Ericsson Championships in Qatar in October, and revealed then that she had been struggling with the problem for three months. Forced to withdraw from her scheduled opening event of 2010, the Brisbane International, Safina was then beaten by compatriot Elena Dementieva in the quarterfinals in Sydney. She had to retire in the fourth round of the Australian Open in the first set of her clash with another Russian, Maria Kirilenko. Dubai organizers expect the rest of the world's top-10 players to play, including Australian Open winner Serena Williams and her sister Venus, the defending champion. World No. 1 Serena pulled out of this week's Paris Indoor Open due to a leg injury, leaving Dementieva as the highest-ranked player.

"Editor's Note: The staff at CNN.com has recently been intrigued by the journalism of VICE, an independent media company and Web site based in Brooklyn, New York. VBS.TV is Vice's broadband television network. The reports, which are produced solely by VICE, reflect a very transparent approach to journalism, where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process. We believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our CNN.com readers. Brooklyn, New York (VBS.TV) -- Getting into North Korea was one of the weirdest processes VBS has ever dealt with. After we went back and forth with their representatives for months, they finally said they were going to allow 16 journalists to come and cover the Arirang Mass Games in Pyongyang. Just before our departure, they suddenly said, ""No, nobody can come."" Then they said, ""OK, OK, you can come. But only as tourists."" But they already knew we were journalists, and over there if you get caught being a journalist when you're supposed to be a tourist you go to jail. We don't like jail. And we're willing to bet we'd hate jail in North Korea. But we went for it. The first leg of the trip was a flight into northern China. At the airport, the North Korean consulate took our passports and all our money, then brought us to a restaurant along with our tour group. All the other diners left, and these women came out and started singing North Korean nationalist songs. We were thinking, ""Look, we were just on a plane for 20 hours. Can't we just go to bed?"" But this guy with our group who was from the L.A. Times told us, ""Everyone in here besides us is secret police. If you don't act excited then you're not going to get your visa."" So we got drunk and sang songs with the girls. The next day we got our visas. A lot of people we had gone with didn't get theirs. We flew into North Korea that night. We were supposed to have three days before the games started, but as soon as we got on the ground they told us, ""The games are happening now."" We went straight to the stadium, and there were 40,000 people in the stands, portraying the history of the North Korean revolution with flip cards. On the playing field before them, about 60,000 people did wild synchronized-gymnastics routines. The 15 of us who made up the audience watched from a marble dais. We were the only spectators. Fifteen audience members for a 100,000-man extravaganza. See the rest of the Vice Guide to North Korea . The next day, our grand tour began. We went to the International Friendship Museum, which comprises 2,000 rooms carved into the bottom of a mountain. The displays are all gifts from different world leaders. Joseph Stalin gave Kim Il-sung a train. Mao Zedong also gave Kim Il-sung a train. He got hunting rifles from communist East Germany's Erich Honecker and Romania's Nicolae Ceausescu and all the other Eastern-bloc guys. Madeleine Albright famously gave Kim Jong-il a basketball signed by Michael Jordan. Perhaps the weirdest thing about North Koreans is that they genuinely don't seem to know that the rest of the planet hates and fears them. They believe (or maybe they really convincingly lie about believing) that the whole world admires and envies them and that they're the true light of socialism and Juche, which is their leader's philosophy of Communist self-reliance. As the days went on, North Korea presented us with progressively stranger sights and encounters. Being there was like being nowhere else on the planet. Are we glad that we got into Pyongyang and were able to document it? Yes. But are we even gladder that we made it out? Watch our documentary on the trip and try to guess the answer.","A VBS.TV crew gets into North Korea after months of negotiation .

"Dallas, Texas (CNN)  -- The modern Tea Party movement began on February 27, 2009, when small groups in 22 American cities gathered to protest the signing of President Obama's stimulus bill. The Tea Party groups viewed the stimulus bill as the crowning moment of decades of irresponsible government fiscal behavior. The federal government is addicted to spending, and the consequences are now staring us in the face. Our national debt is at emergency levels and growing rapidly. Congressional Budget Office head Doug Elmendorf recently said the nation's fiscal path is simply ""unsustainable."" And yet this financial crisis seems obvious to virtually everyone except our elected officials in Washington. Tea Party members are not averse to paying taxes. However, taxpayers are stretched thin, and piling more taxes on their backs is not the answer. We do not understand nor approve of Washington's insatiable appetite for spending, because that's not the way we as individuals live. We do not massively overspend today and borrow money tomorrow to cover the bills. As California and New York are learning, that ride eventually comes to an end. This week, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said, ""To avoid large and unsustainable budget deficits, the nation will ultimately have to choose among higher taxes, modifications to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, less spending on everything else from education to defense, or some combination of the above."" The Tea Party endorses massive reductions of federal spending before any consideration of new taxes is brought to the table. Tea Party members clearly understand Bernanke's warning. If something drastic is not done soon, our entire financial system and way of life will collapse. The Tea Party's goal from inception has been to replace big-spending politicians from both political parties with common-sense, fiscally responsible leaders. America has moved away from the vision of our Founding Fathers who advocated for a nuanced balance between federal and state power. As America has drifted from constitutional values, federal power has grown. We have gone from a nation of self-sufficient producers to a nation divided between overburdened taxpaying producers and some nonproducers who exist on welfare from cradle to grave. So what would the Tea Party movement recommend to set America on its rightful course? Federal spending must immediately be drastically slashed across the board: Abolish the useless departments of Education and Agriculture, among others; get rid of the EPA; and repeal the stimulus bill and other pork spending. These are millstones around the neck of the American taxpayer and our economy. Send all responsibilities of these agencies back to the states where they can be better and more efficiently managed. Foreign aid and Pentagon spending must be equally constrained and reduced. Second, the number of government jobs must be substantially cut, and those employees must return to the private sector. Overpaid bureaucrats with fat benefits and pensions not found in the real world are simply not needed. Or wanted. Third, fraud and welfare waste must be eliminated. Welfare and unemployment benefits must be drastically cut. Welfare, health and education services for illegal immigrants must be eliminated. The Center for Immigration Studies recently reported that 33 percent of immigrant households use some kind of ""welfare."" Again, who pays? The American taxpayer! Government must get completely out of the private sector. Market freedoms must prevail for America to be successful. Government control over our financial and insurance industries, major manufacturing, health care and energy is a sure recipe for disaster. Washington bureaucrats are simply incapable of efficiency. The Tea Party is determined to send new, fiscally responsible leaders to Washington to trim government fat -- and not with scalpels, but with chainsaws. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Phillip Dennis.","Phillip Dennis: Eliminate Education and Agriculture departments, the EPA, the stimulus bill .

"(CNN) -- In a long-awaited speech Thursday in Florida, President Obama will boldly go where no president has gone before, laying out an entirely new vision for the U.S. space program. The firestorm of controversy has already begun . For more than 50 years, presidents have pushed for government rockets to send astronauts to space, the moon and possibly Mars. But now a new paradigm is being proposed. The moon program is off the table, and Mars is only a distant possibility. NASA is essentially getting out of the astronaut business, letting the Russians and private enterprise take over. The glory days of NASA, some say, are over. The Obama plan is truly breathtaking, ending an era that lasted from Presidents Kennedy to Bush. Some specifics: . • The moon program, called Constellation, is being suspended, and its components and $9 billion of research are going down the drain. The Ares rocket, which recently underwent a successful preliminary test, will be canceled. The Orion lunar module will be repurposed as an astronaut ""lifeboat"" tethered to the international space station. • The space shuttle program is ending, causing 4,600 workers to lose their jobs. (This was also in the Bush plan, but that proposal included funding the Ares rocket.) • Without a space shuttle, the U.S. will rely temporarily on Russian rockets to send our astronauts into space. • Eventually, private enterprise will take over launching our astronauts. Some critics say that this is all too much, too soon. Private companies may not be ready to pick up the slack for years to transport astronauts. Conceivably, any political crisis with the Russians in far-away places, such as the Balkans, might affect our access to outer space. And we will just have to swallow our pride when the Chinese plant their flag on the moon sometime after 2020, as they say they will. Proponents of the plan Obama is expected to describe, however, say that it is long overdue and inevitable. In these trying financial times, the U.S. cannot sustain an ambitious space program. Get real, they say. Let private enterprise take over. It's the American way. But everyone agrees that the wheel is broken and needs to be fixed. It all boils down to one dirty four-letter word: cost. During the Cold War, the superpowers gladly opened their treasuries because the space race was a matter of national pride and honor. Since then, the realities have sunk in. It costs about $10,000 per pound to send anything into near-Earth orbit. (Think of John Glenn made of solid gold.) But when you add in life support and safety factors, it costs about $65 million to send each astronaut aboard the space shuttle, which in turn costs half a billion dollars per launch. To go to the moon would cost perhaps 10 times as much. There are some positive recommendations that Obama should keep in mind as he plots the future of the space program. • NASA needs to set concrete goals and deadlines. In the past, the space shuttle and the international space station were used to justify each other's existence. Instead, the space program should hold the feet of the bureaucracies and corporations to the fire. Having a tangible vision of the future, with a clear destination and mission, will hold planners accountable, give a sharp focus to the objectives of the space program and cut waste. • NASA has to abandon its cost-plus model, where it guarantees its contractors a profit beyond the cost. This model is unsustainable -- the tail wagging the dog. It's an open invitation for bureaucracies and corporations to pad their budgets, rather than operate as efficiently as possible. • NASA has to inspire competition and innovation. The Hubble Space Telescope and the robotic missions to the planets have been a shining beacon for research based on goals set by scientists instead of the narrow priorities of bureaucracies and politicians. • NASA has to fund risky, out-of-the-box propulsion systems -- besides the expensive chemical rockets that are used now -- to help drive down the cost of space travel. A lot of a rocket's fuel goes into lifting itself into orbit, which is a waste. Ground-based laser and microwave beams, for example, can vaporize water contained in a rocket, which is then shot out the other end, so only the payload goes into space, not the fuel. As he speaks to aerospace workers, the president should frame this moment as an opportunity to redesign the space program. The key is to maintain the U.S. as the leader in innovation, ideas and progress, because science is ultimately the engine of prosperity. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Michio Kaku.","Michio Kaku: President Obama's changes to space program alter vision that's held for 50 years .

"(CNN) -- Spanish leaders Barcelona gave Real Madrid hope of snatching the Spanish title after being held 0-0 at city rivals Espanyol on Saturday in a tense match that saw Daniel Alves sent off with half an hour to play. Real can now cut the champions' league lead to just one point by winning at home to third-placed Valencia on Sunday night, after which there will be five rounds to play. The stalemate was the first time Barcelona had failed to score in La Liga since October, and came ahead of Tuesday's Champions League semifinal first leg away to Inter Milan. Should that match in Italy go ahead if European air travel resumes following the volcanic ash fallout from Iceland, Inter boss Jose Mourinho will have eagerly noted Espanyol's success in nullifying Barcelona's star-studded line-up. Mid-table Espanyol lost 1-0 at the Nou Camp in December, but could have led at halftime in the first match between the two teams at the new Cornella-El Prat stadium. Barcelona had hit the crossbar when winger Pedro's cross deceived goalkeeper Carlos Kameni, but the home side created the better chances and should have scored just before halftime but Victor Valdes pushed striker Osvaldo's shot onto the near post. Alves was dismissed for a second booking in the 62nd minute after body checking Jose Callejon, but Espanyol could not take advantage of having an extra man. Earlier on Saturday, fourth-placed Sevilla bounced back from the midweek defeat at struggling Valladolid to crush Sporting Gijon 3-0, who had two players sent off. Mali striker Fredi Kanoute opened the scoring in the eight minute after his initial header was blocked, and 13th-placed Gijon lost Mate Bilic to a second yellow card on 32. Kanoute's strike partner Luis Fabiano doubled the lead eight minutes after halftime with a header from Adriano's cross as the Brazilian made up for having an earlier effort ruled out for offside. Jose Angel Valdes was sent off for a second booking with 10 minutes left after Alvaro Negredo went down clutching his face, and the Sevilla forward set up defender Cala from the resulting free-kick. Villarreal claimed sixth place from Athletic Bilbao after beating Atletico Madrid 2-1 in the late match. Argentine defender Diego Godin diverted in a 21st-minute corner and Italian forward Giuseppe Rossi made Atletico pay for calamitous defending just before halftime. Argentina forward Sergio Aguero ended his recent goal drought with his 19th of the season with a volley from Jose Antonio Reyes' pass in the 64th minute, but 10th-placed Atletico went down to a 15th league loss this season ahead of Thursday's Europa League semifinal first leg against English club Liverpool. Bilbao can move back into the top six with victory at Zaragoza on Sunday, while fifth-placed Mallorca face mid-table Osasuna.","Spanish leaders Barcelona held to frustrating 0-0 draw at city rivals Espanyol .

"Jerusalem (CNN) -- A number of Israelis and tourists entering the country at Ben Gurion Airport have had their new Apple iPads seized by customs officials. Israeli authorities say the devices' Wi-Fi standard does not match Israel's standard, which is also used in Europe. Yechiel Shavi, spokesman for the Ministry of Communication, told CNN that the ban only applies to those iPads built for the American standard but would not apply to devices that match the European specifications. Apple announced on Wednesday that it was delaying the worldwide release of iPads because ""demand is far higher than we predicted and will likely continue to exceed our supply."" ""We know that many international customers waiting to buy an iPad will be disappointed by this news, but we hope they will be pleased to learn the reason -- the iPad is a runaway success in the U.S. thus far,"" the company said in a statement announcing the delay. Those words are not likely to comfort those in Israel who have had their iPads taken away, with reports of angry scenes at the airport. Customs officials said that tourists will be able to get the devices back when they leave the country. Tech-savvy Israelis are known for grabbing up the latest high-tech consumer goods, including Apple's iPhone, which became a must-have item when it released in Israel in the last year. iDigital, which represents Apple, in Israel was unavailable for comment as of this writing.","Israelis, tourists at Ben Gurion Airport have had their Apple iPads seized .

"(CNN) -- The medical examiner has ruled that the death of Daniel Kerrigan, the father of figure skater Nancy Kerrigan, was a homicide, the Middlesex County district attorney's office said Tuesday. The skater's brother, Mark, was arraigned in January on assault and battery charges in an incident involving his father, but the district attorney's office would not say if other charges might be filed against the younger Kerrigan in light of the medical examiner's finding. Daniel Kerrigan, 70, died January 24 after an alleged altercation with his son at the Kerrigan home in Stoneham, Massachusetts. The Kerrigan family released a statement through their attorney expressing disappointment ""that the medical examiner would release a cause of death without having all of the relevant facts. We believe this finding to be premature and inaccurate."" ""The Kerrigan family does not blame anyone for the unfortunate death of Dan Kerrigan, who had a pre-existing heart condition,"" said the family statement, released by attorney Tracy Miner. Mark Kerrigan, 45, pleaded not guilty to the charges against him January 26. Through his attorney, he denied any responsibility in his father's death. According to Middlesex County Assistant District Attorney Elizabeth Keeley, police responded to a 911 call at approximately 1:30 a.m. January 24 from Brenda Kerrigan, wife of Daniel and mother to Mark and Nancy Kerrigan. Keeley told District Court Judge Mark Sullivan during the arraignment for Mark Kerrigan that there was a violent argument and struggle between the father and his son, resulting in the elder Kerrigan falling or collapsing on the kitchen floor. Keeley said Mark Kerrigan told authorities ""that he did in fact have an argument with his father, the argument became physical, he grabbed his father around the neck, and at some point the father collapsed to the floor."" According to Keeley, police found Mark Kerrigan in the basement of the house, ""clearly intoxicated"" and ""extremely combative."" He refused to comply with police officers, said Keeley, and they had to subdue him with pepper spray before forcibly removing him from the home. Mark Kerrigan's attorney, Denise Moore, said in court that Kerrigan was unemployed, was recently released from a correctional facility and was living at home with his parents. He is taking medications and seeking psychological help for post-traumatic stress, apparently from his time in the Army, she added. Despite appeals from his attorney, the judge ordered Kerrigan held on $10,000 cash bail. His next court appearance is expected to be February 24. Nancy Kerrigan first gained prominence by winning a bronze medal at the 1992 Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. In 1994 she earned a silver medal in Lillehammer, Norway. But she is perhaps best remembered for being injured in an attack before the 1994 Winter Games by skating rival Tonya Harding's ex-husband and an accomplice.","NEW: Death of figure skater's father on January 24 ruled a homicide .

"(CNN) -- Haiti's top prosecutor on Friday denied reports that charges have been dropped against nine of the 10 American missionaries accused of kidnapping children after a devastating earthquake hit the nation in January. Attorney General Joseph Manes was responding to news from the office of U.S. Sen Jim Risch, R-Idaho, whose staff on Thursday said the charges had been dropped against all but one of the Baptist missionaries. Group leader Laura Silsby remains in a Haitian jail. Risch spokesman Kyle Hines said the senator had been contacted by officials at the U.S. State Department, confirming that the kidnapping charges against the other nine were dropped. However, Manes said that information was ""absolutely incorrect."" He said that under Haitian law, all charges against the 10 Americans stand until the examining judge, Bernard Saint-Vil, renders his final decision on whether to proceed to trial. Risch's communications director, Brad Hoaglun, said: ""We are standing by what we were orginally told by the State Department. We did, however, ask the State Department to reconfirm for us, and we are waiting that response."" A senior State Department official told CNN Friday the charges were dropped, but deferred questions to Haiti's government, saying ""this was a Haitian decision."" On Thursday, Saint-Vil could not be reached for comment and Manes declined to respond to CNN's questions until he could do so in person on Friday. Authorities in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, accused the group, many of whom belong to a Baptist church in Idaho, of trying to kidnap 33 Haitian children after an earthquake in January leveled much of the capital and surrounding areas. The Rev. Clint Henry of the Central Valley Baptist Church said the missionaries were notified by a State Department e-mail that the charges were dropped and no other charges were pending. Meanwhile, Manes said his office received the documents pertaining to Saint-Vil's investigation and that his staff has five days to derive an opinion, which will remain confidential, on whether to move forward on a trial or dismiss the charges. At that point the case will be returned to the judge for a final decision. The 10 Americans have said they were trying to help the children get to a safe place after the magnitude-7.0 earthquake. Haitian authorities stopped the group on January 29 as they tried to cross the border with the children without proper legal documentation. The group said it was going to house the children in a converted hotel in the Dominican Republic and later move them to an orphanage. Silsby originally claimed the children were orphaned or abandoned, but the Haitian government and the orphans' charity SOS Children say that all have at least one living parent. Some said they placed their children in Silsby's care because that was the only way they knew to ensure a better quality of life. Eight of the missionaries were released from custody in February and a ninth, Charisa Coulter of Boise, Idaho, was released in March. One of the missionaries told CNN affiliate KTKA on Thursday that the news of charges being dropped against him and the others was bittersweet. ""It's partial good news,"" Drew Culberth said. ""It's good for me but not good news for [Laura] Silsby."" CNN's Lonzo Cook contributed to this report.","U.S. senator said Thursday he'd been told charges were dropped against 9 of 10 .

"Beirut, Lebanon (CNN) -- A Lebanese man who had been condemned by a court in Saudi Arabia to die last week for ""sorcery"" has not been executed, his lawyer said Monday. May El Khansa told CNN that she got confirmation from Ibrahim Najjar, Lebanon's justice minister, that her client, Ali Hussain Sibat, was still alive. She added that she had heard Saturday from sources in Saudi Arabia with knowledge of the case that the beheading had not been carried out Friday, as originally planned. Also Saturday, she said, she sent an official letter to Saudi Arabia's King Abdullah asking him to pardon her client. She said she would send more letters of appeal Tuesday to Lebanese government officials asking them to intervene. Saudi government officials would not comment to CNN about the case. Justice Minister Najjar said last week that he had urged the Saudi government not to carry out the execution, and Sibat's wife made an emotional plea for mercy from the kingdom's rulers during a CNN interview Thursday. ""All I ask is for the Saudi king and the Saudi government to show him mercy -- let him come back to his country and his family,"" Samira Rahmoon said. Sibat used to offer predictions and advice to callers on a Lebanese television network. He was arrested by Saudi Arabia's religious police and charged with sorcery while visiting the country in May 2008 while on an Islamic pilgrimage, El Khansa said. Saudi authorities have not disclosed details of the charge for which Sibat has been condemned. ""We can't understand how they could arrest him and charge him and sentence him to death,"" Rahmoon said. ""It doesn't make any sense."" El Khansa said Wednesday that she had been told about the upcoming execution by a Saudi source with knowledge of the case and the proceedings. Lebanon's government said it had no confirmation that his execution had been set, but Najjar called the sentence ""disproportionate."" ""I have asked them not to implement any execution in this case,"" he said. ""As far as I know, such an act doesn't deserve such a punishment, unless there is something else -- something that I have not had the possibility to study or to examine myself."" Rahmoon said the family has been unable to contact Sibat ""for a long time"" and has received no official notification that her husband's execution date has been set. ""We don't understand how he could be executed without us getting any notification first,"" Rahmoon said. ""How could they decide to execute him and not inform us?"" A law against witchcraft remains on the books in Lebanon, but is the equivalent of a misdemeanor, Najjar said. ""I respect the law of Saudi Arabia, which is based on Sharia law,"" he said. ""But at the same time, I'm very concerned about such a sentence."" Sibat was convicted by a court in Medina and sentenced to death in November, El Khansa said. He appealed, and his case was sent back to the trial court for reconsideration. But the judges in Medina upheld their original verdict in March, she said. The human rights group Amnesty International has called for Sibat's release. His case drew a small knot of protesters from a Lebanese youth group to the Saudi Embassy in Beirut on Thursday, and Najjar said he told his Saudi counterpart that beheading Sibat ""would not be productive"" to Lebanese-Saudi relations. ""I have done what I thought was responsible for the justice minister in Lebanon to do, and I said to my colleague in Saudi Arabia that such an act in Lebanon would not be sanctioned by more than two months of imprisonment,"" Najjar said.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- The death toll from heavy floods and mudslides in Mexico increased Tuesday to 41, a government agency announced. Most of the deaths -- 30 -- have occurred in eastern Michoacan state, on the central Pacific coast. The state attorney general's office released a list of the deceased Tuesday. Another 12 people are missing after mudslides from two large hills, Michoacan Gov. Leonel Godoy said Tuesday. The remaining 11 deaths resulted from a mudslide Saturday near the small town of Temascaltepec in neighboring Mexico state. Interior Secretary Fernando Francisco Gomez Mont has declared a state of natural disaster for the Michoacan cities of Angangueo, Ocampo, Tiquicheo de Nicolas Romero, Tuxpan and Tuzantla. The declaration makes those cities eligible for money from the federal natural disaster fund. The death toll in Michoacan had been 27 until three additional bodies were discovered Tuesday. Godoy said officials are focusing on three tasks: searching for anyone who is alive, recovering bodies and removing boulders and downed trees. Officials are under pressure to act quickly, he said, because another cold front with more possible rain is expected within the next few days. More than 3,500 Michoacan residents are homeless, the state government said on its Web site. In addition to Michoacan and Mexico states, unusually heavy rain in the past week also flooded parts of Mexico City, the nation's capital. Up to 37,000 people nationwide have been affected, government officials said. On Sunday, Mexican President Felipe Calderon toured Valle de Chalco, another city in Mexico state on the eastern outskirts of the Mexico City metro area. National Water Commission Director Jose Luis Luege said Tuesday that contaminated water from a sewage network there that overflowed Friday will continue to flood the town for at least another 48 hours. The break in the sewage pipe had been fixed, but it burst again. Officials also built two dikes to contain the sewage but were unable to use them out of concern that they would burst under the intense pressure from the floodwaters, Luege said. ""It's a very complicated operation,"" he said. More than 3,000 homes in Valle de Chalco were flooded. Mexico state is bordered on the west by Michoacan and adjoins Mexico City on three sides -- north, east and west.","Most of deaths have been in Mexico's eastern Michoacan state .

"(Mental Floss) -- Either I had a really short attention span as a kid and never made it past the first verse of a song -- which is entirely possible -- or there are some obscure lyrics to the songs we all know and love. 1. ""The Teapot Song"" goes on to further explain this little teapot character: . I'm a clever teapot, Yes it's true Here let me show you What I can do I can change my handle And my spout Just tip me over and pour me out! 2. ""Do Your Ears Hang Low?"" I'm impressed that a children's song contains the word ""semaphore."" Do your ears hang high? Do they reach up to the sky? Do they droop when they are wet? Do they stiffen when they're dry? Can you semaphore your neighbour with a minimum of labour? Do your ears hang high? 3. ""My Bonnie Lies Over the Ocean"" involves terrifying nightmares: .

""Oh My Darling Clementine"" I didn't know anything beyond the ""Oh my darling"" chorus, but there's a whole little tale that goes along with the tragic Clementine. There are a few variations. One of them goes like this: . In a cavern, in a canyon, Excavating for a mine Dwelt a miner forty niner, And his daughter Clementine Light she was and like a fairy, And her shoes were number nine, Wearing boxes, without topses, Sandals were for Clementine. Drove she ducklings to the water Ev'ry morning just at nine, Hit her foot against a splinter, Fell into the foaming brine. Ruby lips above the water, Blowing bubbles, soft and fine, But, alas, I was no swimmer, So I lost my Clementine. How I missed her! How I missed her, How I missed my Clementine, But I kissed her little sister, I forgot my Clementine. 5. ""Bingo"" The earliest recorded version from 1888 adds two verses after the one that spells out the famous farmer's dog's name. They went like this: . Thys Franklyn, syrs, he brewed goode ayle, And he called it Rare good Styngo! S, T, Y, N, G, O! He call'd it Rare goode Styngo! Nowe is notte thys a prettie song? I thinke it is, bye Jyngo, J wythe a Y -- N, G, O -- I sweare yt is, bye Jyngo! Mental Floss: Look What the Dog Swallowed! 6. ""Twinkle, Twinkle, Little Star"" just keeps going: . When the blazing sun is gone, When he nothing shines upon, Then you show your little light, Twinkle, twinkle, all the night. Then the traveller in the dark, Thanks you for your tiny spark, He could not see which way to go, If you did not twinkle so. In the dark blue sky you keep, And often through my curtains peep, For you never shut your eye, Till the sun is in the sky. As your bright and tiny spark, Lights the traveller in the dark, -- Though I know not what you are, Twinkle, twinkle, little star. 7.

"New Delhi, India (CNN) -- An explosion Saturday at an eatery in the western Indian city of Pune killed at least nine people and injured 33 others, authorities said. ""It appears to be a bomb blast, and bombs obviously are related to terrorism,"" said U.K. Bansal, special secretary for security in India's Interior Ministry. Four of the dead were not from India, he told CNN. Home Secretary G.K. Pillai told reporters that the explosives were packed in a bag noticed by a waiter at the popular eatery called the German Bakery. The explosion occurred about 7:30 p.m. local time Saturday. Rajendra Sonawane, joint police commissioner for the city, said the blast struck the German Bakery in Pune's Koregaon Park, sister network CNN-IBN reported. Initially, authorities thought a cooking gas cylinder had exploded at the bakery, but all cylinders were accounted for, according to CNN-IBN. An anti-terrorism squad is assisting in the investigation, Chandra Iyengar, home secretary for Maharashtra state, told CNN. However, he wouldn't confirm the blast as a terrorist attack. The German Bakery is frequented by tourists. It's near the Osho Ashram, a commune founded by the late Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, who returned to India from the United States in the 1980s.

"(CNN) -- Calling capital punishment in California an ""empty promise,"" the father of murdered teen Chelsea King said he supported a deal to take death off the table for his daughter's killer in order to bring closure to the community. ""We stand here because of a despicable evil act committed against our beautiful daughter, Chelsea, committed against our family and committed against our community,"" Brent King said in a news conference Friday. ""While our unequivocal first choice is the death penalty, we acknowledge that in California that penalty has become an empty promise."" San Diego County District Attorney Bonnie Dumanis said the family's blessing contributed to a plea deal with registered sex offender John Gardner III in Chelsea's death and two other cases. Gardner, 31, pleaded guilty Friday to the murder of King, the murder of Amber Dubois, and assault with intent to commit rape of a third person. King, 17, was last seen alive leaving Poway High School in suburban San Diego on February 25. Her car, with her cell phone inside, was found at Rancho Bernardo Community Park, where she was known to run on the trails. Her disappearance sparked a massive search that ended a few days later with the discovery of her remains in the park. Dubois, 14, disappeared in February 2009 while walking to school in Escondido. She was considered a missing person for more than a year, until her remains were found in March. Prosecutors revealed in court Friday that Gardner led authorities to Dubois' body in exchange for assurances that it would not be used against him in court. In exchange for his guilty pleas, Gardner is to be sentenced to two consecutive terms of life without the possibility of parole. He also waived his right to appeals, ensuring that he will die in prison, Dumanis said at the news conference. Superior Court Judge David Danielsen accepted the plea and scheduled sentencing for June 1. A gag order is in place until then. The surprise change of plea came during a hearing Friday, after prosecutors charged him with murder with a special circumstance of rape for Dubois's death. Gardner was facing the death penalty on one charge of murder with a special circumstance of rape for King's death. Dressed in dark blue jailhouse garb, his wrists chained, Gardner nervously responded ""yes"" several times to the judge's questioning of whether he understood his rights and was entering his plea willingly. He cast his gaze downward as the judge read brief descriptions of how he raped and murdered Dubois and King. Gardner made no statement. According to court documents, on February 13, 2009, Gardner abducted Dubois and brought her to a remote area of Pala, where he raped and stabbed her, and buried her in a shallow grave. Gardner admitted to attacking King while she was running and dragging her to a remote area, the documents said. He raped and strangled her, and also buried her body in a shallow grave. Gardner also admitted to attacking another female on December 27, 2009, while she was running. In a news conference after Friday's hearing, Dubois' father, Moe, expressed gratitude over the case's resolution. ""As you can imagine, this turn of events in the case came as a surprise to all of us when we were informed about the details yesterday,"" he said. ""As a parent I am thankful [for] the work put forth by the district attorney's office and the defense team in coming forth with a resolution in the case and allowing us to have justice and closure for Amber's case."" Without the plea deal, Dumanis said her office did not have enough evidence to charge Gardner in the death of Dubois. Her remains were not found until Gardner led authorities to her body, three days after he was charged in King's death, Dumanis said. ""The only promise made to him in exchange for this information was that we could not use it against him in court. This was a somber decision,"" the district attorney said in a press conference after Friday's hearing, surrounded by tearful family members. ""To end the anguish of the unknown for the Dubois family and to bring Amber home, we agreed we would not use this information against Gardner in court."" Further efforts to collect evidence linking Gardner to Dubois' death were unsuccessful, Dumanis said, leaving her office otherwise unable to pursue charges against him -- until he offered to plead guilty. ""Accepting this plea has been an extremely difficult decision. We have the evidence to pursue a murder charge against the defendant for Chelsea's murder, but not for Amber's murder,"" she said. ""By accepting this guilty plea, we are obtaining a conviction for the murder of Amber that we otherwise would not have been able to obtain."" The prosecutor also echoed the sentiments of King's father on the death penalty in California, where 13 executions have been carried out since the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976. ""Most of us realize a death sentence at this time is a hollow promise in California. Even if death was imposed, Brent, Kelly and their family would have to endure a preliminary hearing, a trial, decades of appeals and the pain of reliving the murder over and over again,"" she said. ""In addition, as parents they realized what Amber's parents were facing. Her case would have no legal closure."" A resolution for the Dubois family also figured into the King family's decision to support the plea, Brent King said. ""We find ourselves in a position to help give another grieving family a measure of closure. The Dubois family has been through unthinkable hell the past 14 months. We couldn't imagine the confession to Amber's murder never seeing the light of day, leaving an eternal question mark,"" he said. ""There's nothing, nothing satisfying about this moment. It's only one more unbearably painful day that we'll have to carry in our memory as long as we live.""","John Albert Gardner III admits to raping, murdering Chelsea King, Amber Dubois .

"(CNN) -- Spain striker Fernando Torres faces a race against time to be fit for the start of the World Cup after being ruled out for the rest of the European soccer season. Torres' English club Liverpool announced that the player was to have knee surgery on Sunday night and would be sidelined out for about six weeks. That means the 26-year-old will miss the last four games of the English Premier League campaign, with Liverpool battling to qualify for next season's Champions League. He has scored 22 goals this season, but had a month out after a knee operation in January. Top scorer Torres will also sit out both legs of the Europa League semifinal against Spanish side Atletico Madrid, with the second-tier European club tournament being Liverpool's only hope of winning a trophy this season. ""Fernando saw a specialist in Spain earlier today and it was decided that he would need surgery on a torn cartilage in his right knee,"" Liverpool's Web site reported on Sunday. ""This will be carried out later tonight. We cannot comment ahead of the operation, but as a guide, the usual rehabilitation period for this type of procedure is around six weeks."" The World Cup in South Africa kicks off on June 11, with Spain's first match against Switzerland five days later -- which gives Torres a two-week window to return to match fitness. Spain coach Vicente del Bosque must name his final 23-man squad by June 1. European champions Spain will have pre-tournament friendlies in Austria against Saudi Arabia on May 29 and South Korea on June 3, then play Poland in Murcia on June 8. Meanwhile, Arsenal's English Premier League title hopes are over after the third-placed London club conceded three goals in the last 11 minutes to lose 3-2 at struggling Wigan. Arsenal led with goals by England winger Theo Walcott and French defender Mikael Silvestre either side of halftime, but Ben Watson pulled one back with 10 minutes to play and a howler by Polish goalkeeper Lukasz Fabianski gifted Titus Bramble a headed equalizer and Charles N'Zogbia curled in a superb injury-time winner. It was Arsenal's second defeat in five days following the 2-1 reverse at fourth-placed Tottenham, and left Arsene Wenger's team six points behind leaders Chelsea with three games to play. Wigan moved seven points clear of the relegation zone to almost guarantee another season in the top flight. Aston Villa moved above Liverpool into sixth place with a 2-1 win at relegated Portsmouth as substitute Nathan Delfouneso scored the winner with his first touch after Norway striker John Carew leveled and then missed a first-half penalty. In Spain, Real Madrid closed the gap on leaders Barcelona with a 2-0 victory at home to third-placed Valencia. Argentina striker Gonzalo Higuain coolly slotted his 25th league goal of the campaign after turning onto Guti's threaded pass in the 25th minute, while fellow top scorer Cristiano Ronaldo sidefooted home Marcelo's low cross with 12 minutes to play to also have 27 this season. Real trail champions Barca by one point with five matches to play, while Valencia are another 24 points adrift. Mallorca can move up to fourth place above Sevilla with victory at home to Osasuna on Monday. In Sunday's other games, Athletic Bilbao stayed seventh after a 0-0 draw at home to struggling Zaragoza, third-bottom Tenerife won 3-2 against eighth-placed Getafe, Deportiva La Coruna drew 0-0 with Almeria, while Malaga were also held goalless by fellow relegation battlers Valladolid. In Italy, Roma returned to the top of Serie A with a 2-1 victory against Rome rivals Lazio on Sunday. Montenegro forward Mirko Vucinic scored both goals, the second a fine free-kick, after Tommaso Rocchi's 14th-minute opener for Lazio as Roma went one point clear of champions Inter Milan with with games to play. Lazio should have led 2-0 but Sergio Floccari missed a penalty just after halftime, while teammate Cristian Ledesma was sent off at the end.

"New York (CNN) -- The son of actor Michael Douglas apologized to a federal judge before being sentenced to a five-year prison term Tuesday, promising to follow ""the true right path"" when released. Cameron Douglas, 31, pleaded guilty to distributing large quantities of methamphetamine and cocaine in January. ""I apologize to the court for my decisions and actions that put me in front of you today,"" Douglas said in a trembling voice. He added, ""I have developed, in my mind, the idea that I want to take the right path, the true right path."" U.S. District Judge Richard Berman rebuffed pleas by defense lawyers for a more lenient sentencing, telling the spectators that prison may be Douglas' ""last chance."" Cameron Douglas is the son of the two-time Academy Award winner and his first wife, Diandra Luker, both of whom attended the sentencing. As Cameron Douglas spoke, his mother was crying and his father appeared to be fighting back tears. Douglas, who was arrested in July 2009 at a Manhattan nightclub, asked Berman ""for opportunity to be a role model to my younger brothers and sisters."" ""I believe, your honor, things will be different this time,"" he added. If given a second chance, he said, ""I will never squander that opportunity."" Berman acknowledged that numerous letters sent on the defendant's behalf by celebrities and others, but said some of the letters implied that he should not make an example of Douglas because he is the son of a famous actor. ""None acknowledged appropriately the numerous impacts to victims of society for dealing drugs,"" the judge said.","Cameron Douglas pleaded guilty in January to distributing meth and cocaine .

"(CNN) -- The Icelandic volcano producing the ash cloud snarling much of European air traffic has not stopped erupting. Is there any chance that flight schedules could return to normal any time soon, and does the weather forecast provide any relief? Here are some common questions and answers about the ash cloud crisis. Q: For how long will the volcanic cloud remain in the atmosphere? A: The very fine ash previously injected into higher levels of the atmosphere -- above 20,000 feet -- will remain in the air for ""quite some time,"" because the particles can be removed only by thunderstorms, which are not expected in the next few days, the World Meteorological Organization said Tuesday. The current high pressure system, with weak winds and slowly descending air in the center, is not helping to disperse the ash cloud, the WMO said. Still, the ash particles are slowly descending to lower levels, and there is evidence that most of the ash is now between the ground and about 10,000 feet, the WMO said. Q: What does the weather forecast say? A: The current high-pressure system over Iceland is expected to dissipate toward the end of the week, when a stronger low-pressure system is predicted to develop, the WMO said. Not only will this system change the winds and push the ash toward the Arctic, but the rains associated with this system will help ""wash out"" the ash at lower levels, the WMO said. While that directly affects only the ash in Iceland, it could be good news for the rest of Europe, because some of the ash could be ""washed out"" of the air before it reaches the continent, said CNN weather anchor Mari Ramos. For Ireland and the United Kingdom, upper-level winds coming from the north are not predicted to change any time soon. Any rain that does develop closer to Europe would be unlikely to help wash much of the ash out of the atmosphere, Ramos said, because the ash cloud has generally remained above any weather system. The ash currently being spewed out by the volcano is reaching as high as 20,000 feet. Q: If the weather isn't going to change, when might the volcano stop erupting? A: The eruption will continue for a while, but the activity will become less and less explosive, said volcanologist Simon Day of University College London. The more important question is how long the volcano will continue to send ash high into the atmosphere. ""With the first phases, the ash was going up to 30,000 to 40,000 feet,"" Day said. ""The current levels that the ash is being ejected to is maybe only 10,000 or 20,000 feet. It's probably also coarser-grained ash as well -- it's not quite so finely divided on the whole -- so it's going to settle out faster. So although the eruption may continue for a long time, and we may over the next few months see bursts of explosive activity, it's probably not going to be as much of a problem as it has been during this last week."" Q: Does the appearance of the volcano's plume indicate anything about the ash? A: The whiteness of the plume suggests it contains mainly steam and little ash, the WMO said. When under-glacier eruptions occur, like this one in Iceland, the volcanoes tend to produce finer particles of ash, which stay in the air longer, Day said. That's because the melting ice shatters the magma, which contains the particles that eventually become ash. Q: What do the ash particles look like? A: The particles are extremely fine -- about as fine as pollen, Day said. They are made up of rocks, minerals, and volcanic glass, which together form volcanic ash, the WMO said. Such ash is hard, does not dissolve in water, and is extremely abrasive and mildly corrosive, the WMO said. Q: Iceland has many volcanoes, so why hasn't this situation happened before? A: The last time an Icelandic volcano produced so much ash over Europe was in 1947, when the Hekla volcano erupted -- but that was when there were fewer planes in the sky and the world wasn't as dependent on air travel as it is now, Day said. Disruption to air travel as a result of volcanoes happens frequently in the northern Pacific, along the Alaska-to-Japan route, where four to five days a year ash levels force flights to be diverted, Day said. But airlines can more easily divert their routes there than they can in Europe.","Meteorologists: very fine ash in upper atmosphere will remain for ""quite some time""

"Washington (CNN) -- The United States and Russia say they will be unable to reach a deal on an arms control treaty by the end of the year to replace their existing one, which expired this month. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley told reporters Tuesday that the U.S. delegation -- led by Assistant Secretary Rose Gottemoeller -- had returned for a recess from the START negotiations in Geneva. Talks are expected to resume in mid-January with new proposals. ""The team has gone through an intensive period of negotiations with their Russian counterparts over more than two months,"" Crowley said. ""Our goal remains to conclude a solid treaty for the president's signature as soon as possible."" The 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, commonly known as START, expired on December 5 but the leaders agreed to honor its spirit until a new treaty could be negotiated to replace it. President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, who met last week in Copenhagen, Denmark, had hoped to sign an agreement by the end of the year. A statement on the Russian Foreign Ministry's Web site said, ""Preparation of the new treaty is practically complete"" but ""a few problems have to be overcome in order to finalize the treaty and submit it to [the] presidents of Russia and the United States. This will be done very soon."" ""Having resolved most issues discussed in recent months, delegations arrived at corresponding positions,"" the statement said. ""The Russian side would like to emphasize the talks have been constructive and business-like. It reflects partnership and mutual respect which characterize the current stage in the relations between Russia and the United States."" Crowley also cited a few ""hurdles"" to an agreement, including the complexity of the weapons systems, agreement on the numbers of warhead reductions, and verification. But he said the two sides hope to finalize a deal to replace START when they meet next month. ""Clearly, over the course of these two months, we have made dramatic progress,"" he said. ""There are still issues that we continue to work through, so there's still more work to be done. But I think we remain confident that, given good faith and the ongoing efforts of both sides, that this will get done.""","Talks are expected to resume in mid-January with new proposals .

"(CNN) -- He never told a lie, as the story goes. So maybe if he were alive today, President George Washington could tell a New York City library what he did with two books he checked out 221 years ago. The two books -- weighty discourses on international relations and parliamentary debates -- were checked out on October 5, 1789. They were due on November 2, 1789, but weren't brought back. Since then, they've been steadily collecting a fine of a few cents each day, adding up to more than $4,000 by the New York Society Library's informal estimate. ""I'm sorry, math is not my thing at all,"" said Jane Goldstein, the assistant head librarian when asked to hazard a guess. The fine at the time was 2 pence a day. Now, it's 15 cents -- ""It's really gone up, hasn't it?"" she quipped. One of the librarians, Matthew Haugen, guessed the fine to be in the region of 3,000 British pounds, or about $4,577. ""He stuck with the pence concept,"" Goldstein said. The library first learned of the missing books when it discovered a yellowed ledger in its basement . It listed all the people who had checked out books from the city's oldest library between July 1789 and April 1792. Next to the works ""Law of Nations"" and the 12th volume of ""Common Debates"" was the name of the person who checked them out: ""President."" At the time, New York was the capital of the United States, and the library was the only one in town. Soon after, the capital was relocated to Philadelphia and then Washington D.C. The New York library, a subscription library that was New York's first library open to the public, has known about the missing books since the 1930s. The matter came up again recently because the library is capturing the ledgers in digital form to preserve the records. Library officials cross-checked the books mentioned in the ledger with the ones in their collection. ""Volume 12 (of ""Common Debates"") was still missing,"" as was the other book, Goldstein said. The library is not so concerned about the fine as it is about each book. ""We don't know where it is,"" she said. ""We have tried to find it and we can't,"" she said.","George Washington has racked up a growing fine on two overdue books from NYC library .

"(CNN) -- Claudio Ranieri's Roma side are through to the final of the Italian Cup, despite losing 1-0 to Udinese in the second leg of their semifinal on Wednesday. Serie A leaders Roma will now face Inter Milan at their own Olympic stadium next month in a battle of the leading two teams in the table -- after going through 2-1 on aggregate. Remarkably it will be the fifth time in six seasons that the teams are meeting in the final, with each winning two finals apiece prior to May's showpiece. The only goal came with nine minutes remaining when Alexis Sanchez fired a shot through goalkeeper Julio Sergio's legs from an acute angle. That gave Roma some nervy moments as the clock ran down. Marco Cassetti was sent off for a second bookable offence, meaning the visitors played the last six minutes with just 10 men. And they were lucky not to concede again when Gokhan Inler's fierce drive from long range struck the post. Serie A champions Inter secured their place in the final with a 2-0 aggregate win over Fiorentina last week. Meanwhile, in the English Premier League, Aston Villa boosted their hopes of reaching the fourth Champions League place with a 2-0 win at relegation-threatened Hull. Gabriel Agbonlahor put the visitors ahead in the 13th minute, taking advantage of some poor Hull defending. And Villa secured their win when James Milner netted a 75th-minute penalty after the England midfielder had been fouled in the area by George Boateng. Villa are up to sixth place, three points behind fourth-placed Tottenham although they have played a game more, while remain third bottom of the table, three points behind fourth bottom West Ham United.","Claudio Ranieri's Roma side are through to the final of the Italian Cup .

"(CNN) -- A Delaware pediatrician was indicted Wednesday on 58 additional counts of rape and other sexual offenses in the alleged child abuse of his patients, state Attorney General Beau Biden announced Monday. Dr. Earl Bradley, 56, previously pleaded not guilty to 471 felony counts involving 102 girls and one boy. Wednesday's indictment -- which includes charges of rape, unlawful sexual contact, continuous sexual abuse of a child and sexual exploitation -- involves 24 girls he saw as patients from 1999 to 2009. Biden has said the charges are based on ""video and digital evidence"" seized from Bradley's home and medical practice in December, when the doctor was arrested. Bradley, whose practice was in Lewes, Delaware, also has medical licenses in Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Florida. Authorities have said they have contacted officials in those states. In a February 24 interview with CNN, Bradley's attorney said he would base his client's defense on mental health. ""Most of the evidence in this case comes from videotapes -- it's kind of hard to argue with videotapes,"" Eugene Maurer Jr. said. He added, ""The issue in this case is going to come down to his mental health at the time.""","Dr. Earl Bradley previously pleaded not guilty to 471 felony counts .

"(CNN) -- Apple Inc. hasn't said how much future generations of the iPhone will cost, but an editor of a technology blog said his site shelled out $5,000 to get its hands on a possible prototype. Gizmodo Senior Editor Jesus Diaz said his blog paid ""a source"" $5,000 for the phone, which was shown in a video on the blog Monday. ""Paying for an exclusive has always been done in the journalism world. There are people who admit they do it and people who do not. We have done it,"" Diaz told CNN's Gabriela Frias in an interview on CNN en Español's ""En Efectivo."" Diaz said the blog's source obtained the phone after it was left in a bar. ""An engineer was in a bar, celebrating his birthday. He drank two drinks too many and forgot the phone,"" Diaz said. He said Gizmodo returned the phone to Apple after receiving a letter asking for it. ""It has come to our attention that Gizmodo is currently in possession of a device that belongs to Apple,"" says the short letter from Apple's lawyer to the blog. ""This letter constitutes a formal request that you return the device to Apple. Please let me know where to pick up the unit."" Gizmodo, which posted the letter on its site, said the letter erases any doubt that the phone is the real deal. ""Just so you know, we didn't know this was stolen when we bought it,"" wrote Brian Lam, the site's editorial director, in his response. ""Now that we definitely know it's not some knockoff and it really is Apple's, I'm happy to see it returned to its rightful owner. ""P.S. I hope you take it easy on the kid who lost it. I don't think he loves anything more than Apple except, well, beer."" Photos of the fourth-generation iPhone prototype first appeared on the tech blog Engadget over the weekend. The site said whoever sent the photos found the phone on the floor of a bar in San Jose, California. On Monday, Gizmodo said it had obtained the device, but wouldn't say how. Diaz said the price Gizmodo paid for the phone was worth it, even though editors weren't able to take advantage of all its features. ""It was remotely deactivated by Apple,"" he said. ""But the screen is better, double the resolution of past versions. The quality of the product is much better. ... It is pleasing to touch it."" The find was widely considered the real thing in the tech world. ""At this point we're pretty much certain it is this summer's new model,"" wrote Wired magazine. ""Somebody at Apple is in big trouble."" Daring Fireball blogger John Gruber, who is known to have connections inside Apple's Cupertino, California, headquarters, said on his blog that Apple had reported a prototype stolen. He also said Apple has a patent out for a phone with a ceramic backing. Some of the images online appeared to show just such a backing. Gizmodo's photos of the device's internal components show they're labeled as Apple products. The blog also said a computer recognized the device as an iPhone, and the phone apparently runs the yet-to-be-released iPhone OS 4.0. Apple has not confirmed that a new version of the iPhone exists, though analysts widely expect the fourth generation of the device will be released in the summer. Apple did not return CNN requests for comment. Even if the new iPhone is real, it's important to keep in mind that the device is just a prototype. It's unclear how many of its features will be available on the new phone. A quick glance at the photos shows a flatter, less curvy iPhone. The back of the phone is completely flat, unlike the current model, which is tapered to fit the curve of a palm. The new phone's back is ceramic rather than plastic, and has an aluminum border with two volume buttons instead of just one. Unlike the current model, it has a front-facing camera. It also has a camera on the back, which is larger than the one on the back of the current 3GS model.","Blog editor says his site shelled out $5,000 to get a possible 4G iPhone prototype .

""Wimbledon exists in a highly competitive global marketplace and it is the world's best players who create and drive the interest,"" said All England Club chairman Tim Phillips in a statement on the tournament Web site. ""It is important that we offer a level of prize money which is both appropriate to the prestige of the event and which gives the players full and fair reward."" Phillips also announced that this year's tournament, which runs from June 21 to July 4, will be a ""World Cup-free zone"", with football fans denied the chance to watch matches on the big screens at the All England Club.

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan coach Jose Mourinho has played down the threat posed by Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi as two of European football's giants face off in the Champions League semifinal on Tuesday night. Messi has been in scintillating form all season, scoring all four goals in Barca's quarterfinal second leg victory over Arsenal. The Argentine will spearhead the Barcelona attack in the first leg clash at Milan's San Siro stadium, but Mourinho sees the 22-year-old as just one part of a formidable team. ""What we know is that he is an important player but football, for me, is not about marking man to man, Mourniho told reporters at a pre-match press conference in Milan. ""It is not one against Messi and 10 versus 10, it will be 11 v 11, although he deserves special attention."" Mourinho is charged with plotting a path past the reigning European, Spanish and World Club champions who are seeking to become the first team to defend the European Cup since AC Milan in 1990. Inter drew 0-0 at home with Barca in the group stage of this season's competition and were beaten 2-0 in Spain. ""Barca deserved to win in November,"" said Mourinho, who worked as a translator at Barcelona in the 1990s before becoming a manager and leading Porto to the Champions League trophy in 2004. ""They are as strong now as they were then, but we are much stronger. I don't mind if the football world considers them favorites, I think we have a 50% chance of playing in the final."" Barcelona arrived in Milan on Monday evening after being forced to travel for 14 hours by road because of the volcanic ash cloud hovering over Europe. ""It is not the ideal situation for us to travel 14 hours by coach after a league game and before a semi-final against Inter, but you cannot stop a volcano, can you?,"" said Barca coach Josep Guardiola. ""We decided to use two buses to have more space and I didn't travel with the players because I think it's better for them not to always have their coach with them."" Guardiola is wary of the threat posed by a side who knocked out English Premier League leaders Chelsea in the last 16 and have won the Italian league title the last four years. ""They're a very strong team and we'll need to play well twice. We'll play our game and try to score as many goals as possible,"" he said.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Early-morning commuters in much of the Deep South, braced for the possibility of a second round of snow and ice, had an easier-than-expected ride Monday as warmer temperatures kept winter weather at bay. Most winter weather advisories and warnings were canceled early Monday except for portions of northern Alabama and Georgia at higher elevations. However, the advisories and warnings stretched into Ohio and Pennsylvania. Forecasters had warned of an additional 1 to 3 inches of snow accumulation in the South on Sunday night into Monday morning. The Deep South had up to 6 inches of snow in some areas Friday. But ""the accumulating snow that was in last night's forecast isn't going to happen,"" CNN meteorologist Sean Morris said Monday. ""It is now too warm."" As of 5:30 a.m. ET, the temperature in Atlanta was 41 degrees, well above the freezing mark, and rain was falling. Forecasters initially had expected the rain to turn into snow after 1 a.m. Monday. Snow flurries are forecast later Monday as an Arctic front moves through, Morris said, but no accumulation was expected outside mountainous areas. The weather will be ""not nearly as bad as what was forecast,"" CNN meteorologist Rob Marciano said. Hundreds of flights were canceled out of Atlanta in anticipation of the newest round of winter weather. Delta Air Lines said Sunday that it was canceling 400 flights from early morning through noon Monday, the majority in the Carolinas, Tennessee and Georgia. AirTran Airways canceled 48 flights scheduled to depart or arrive in Atlanta between 8 and 10 a.m. Monday, and a spokesman said more cancellations were possible. Beleaguered states in the mid-Atlantic region also may catch a break from the heavy snowfall initially predicted. A snow emergency set to take effect Monday morning in Washington will not happen. The National Weather Service was forecasting a slight chance of snow before noon, then a mix of rain and snow, with an above-freezing high of 36 degrees. The area already has shoveled itself out of a season record snowfall of 55.9 inches, according to preliminary National Weather Service estimates. iReport: Share your pictures and videos . Slick conditions in Kansas on Sunday caused at least two massive pileups, one of which involved as many as 30 vehicles. Video showed cars, vans and trucks sandwiched on a small bridge, with emergency workers climbing over vehicles to reach the injured. The extent of injuries was not immediately known. Portions of Interstates 70 and 35 were closed for hours, according to the Kansas Department of Transportation. Drivers involved in the I-70 pileup described poor visibility conditions to CNN affiliate KSHB in Kansas City, Missouri.

"(CNN) -- Spain striker Fernando Torres has rejected accusations he put the World Cup before his club Liverpool after he was ruled out of action for six weeks. Torres traveled from England to Barcelona by car to see a specialist, due to the ongoing disruption to flights caused by the ash emanating from a volcano in Iceland, for an operation on his knee. The 26-year-old will miss the rest of the English Premier League season, as well as Liverpool's Europa League semifinal against his former club Atletico Madrid, after picking up the injury in a game against Portuguese side Benfica. He now faces a race to be fit for Spain's opening game of the World Cup in South Africa against Switzerland on June 16. He told his official Web site: ""I picked up the injury in the second minute of the Europa League clash at home to Benfica, and I went onto to play for another 85 minutes with an injured knee. ""If I was only thinking about Spain and the World Cup, I would have asked the boss [Rafael Benitez] to have taken me off straight after the incident. ""We analyzed all the possibilities before finally choosing the last of them all: surgery. The meniscus was damaged and the doctors all agreed that I needed an operation on my right knee."" On the World Cup Torres said: ""I have been waiting four years for this and, if all goes well, I do not anticipate missing it. My road to recovery has already started."" Torres expressed his disappointment at missing the European clash with his former club, Atletico Madrid, who he left to join Liverpool in 2007. He added: ""I was very excited about returning and playing against ""Atleti"". I wanted to be there again and greet the people, because for me this is a very endearing qualification round. I will have many more opportunities in the future.""

"Austin, Texas (CNN) -- The man who flew an airplane into a building housing an Internal Revenue Service office may have replaced some of its seats with a drum of fuel to cause maximum damage, a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation said Friday. The official, who would not speak on the record because it is an ongoing case, said investigators have determined that the Piper Cherokee PA-28 had several seats removed and that a fuel drum was missing from the airport from which Andrew Joseph ""Joe"" Stack III took off Thursday morning. ""I think there is a good chance he might have put it on his plane,"" said the official, who cautioned that investigators were still working that lead and sifting through the crash site. The single-engine plane has a fuel tank capacity of 38 gallons and is equipped with four seats, according to the Web site risingup.com. The FBI said Friday it has taken the lead role in the investigation of Thursday's crash into the 7-story building in northwest Austin that held offices for nearly 200 IRS workers. ""You're talking about a federal agency that was basically assaulted,"" Ralph Diaz, special agent in charge of the FBI's San Antonio, Texas, field office, told reporters. Two people were killed and two others were hospitalized, federal officials said. Though the remains found in the IRS building have been identified, their identities will not be revealed until after a forensic examination, Diaz said Friday. ""One may be Mr. Stack and our fear is certainly the other would be either someone who was visiting or someone who was employed in the building,"" he said. Emergency services chief Ernie Rodriguez said one of the injured was treated and released; the other remained hospitalized. City of Austin Fire Chief Rhoda Mae Kerr credited the building's fire protection, fast work by the Fire Department and the fact that the employees had practiced exiting the building in case of an emergency for the low loss of life and injuries. ""It truly worked,"" she said. Austin attack stuns community . Rodriguez said units arrived on the scene within five minutes of the first 911 call prepared to manage hundreds of injured people. ""We found only two persons,"" he said. ""When you look at the fire, when you look at the evidence, it's hard to say that we were lucky, but we were,"" he said. ""The big thing to remember is that yesterday, in the midst of this event, God's grace was upon us."" Austin Police Chief Art Acevedo credited fast thinking by some people who were inside the building as the plane approached for the fact that few people were hurt. ""Some folks saw it coming and sounded the alarm yesterday, and some folks started running away from that side of the building,"" he said. Stack's wife, Sheryl Stack, expressed her ""sincere sympathy to the victims and their families"" Friday. ""Words cannot adequately express the sorrow or the sympathy I feel for everyone affected by this unimaginable tragedy,"" she said in a statement read by a family friend, Rayford Walker. Authorities say Stack also torched his $230,000 home in Austin on Thursday morning before embarking on his fatal flight. Police said Sheryl Stack spent Wednesday night in an Austin-area hotel but did not say why. Acevedo said police had received no calls of domestic violence from the house. The only calls to police were made a couple of years ago and concerned barking dogs, he said. A 3,000-word message on a Web site registered to Stack railed against the government, particularly the IRS. Read the apparent suicide note (PDF) ""I saw it written once that the definition of insanity is repeating the same process over and over and expecting the outcome to suddenly be different,"" the online message says. ""I am finally ready to stop this insanity. Well, Mr. Big Brother IRS man, let's try something different; take my pound of flesh and sleep well."" Acevedo reiterated on Friday his assertion first made Thursday that the incident was not an act of terrorism. ""Part of our jobs in law enforcement is not to overreact and cause undue panic,"" he said. ""And with the information that we had, there was no need to alarm our colleagues around the country and community members by using the word 'terrorism.' That is why definitely I did not use it yesterday and I'm not using it today."" An IRS criminal investigator visited Stack's accountant after Thursday's events, leaving a business card on the CPA's front door. The online message believed to have been written by Stack mentions accountant Bill Ross, saying it had become ""brutally evident that he was representing himself and not me."" Watch what Stack's writing reveals about him . IRS investigator James L. Neff said that Ross is not under investigation; officials just wanted to make sure he was OK. ""We didn't know if he was alive or dead,"" Neff said. Ross, who did not return a call from CNN, was fine, the investigator said. Friends and former colleagues said Friday they had no inkling of the rage apparently building inside Stack. ""He hid that very well,"" said Billy Eli, in whose band Stack played bass until a few years ago. ""Obviously he was in some serious distress and had some real despair. I never saw that."" Neither did another former bandmate, Ric Furley. Watch how bandmates remember Stack . ""I never saw him in a bad mood or speaking negatively about anything or anyone,"" Furley told CNN's ""American Morning."" ""This has been such a shock because it was totally out of character with the Joe Stack I played with for three years,"" said Eli. ""We liked him,"" said Furley. ""We liked him."" Share information about the crash and the pilot . An IRS spokesman said federal law prohibits the agency from releasing information about any interactions the agency may have had with Stack. The IRS issued a statement Friday saying tax returns will not be delayed.

"Marjah, Afghanistan (CNN) -- U.S. Marines fighting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan achieved a main objective Tuesday -- taking over the police headquarters in the center of the Taliban stronghold of Marjah. CNN correspondent Atia Abawi, embedded with the Marines, said troops didn't receive any resistance when they took the station, but gun battles broke out in the area a few hours later. There was an engagement for 15 to 20 minutes, with constant gunfire coming from different directions, and there have been ""sporadic battles,"" Abawi said. Unlike previous days, there was fighting in the evening, with Taliban militants trying to attack Marine locations with small arms and rocket-propelled grenades. One of the grenades hit close to one of the U.S. positions and a fire broke out. About 15,000 Afghan and NATO forces are taking part in Operation Moshtarak, which focuses on the town of Marjah and surrounding areas in Helmand province. Set in a region known as the country's heroin capital, Marjah is where the Taliban established a shadow government. The military says the goal of Operation Moshtarak is to provide security, governance and development, and authorities hope fighters choose to reject the insurgency and join the government's reintegration process. Clearing out poppy fields is a key part of the push, the biggest since the Afghanistan War started in 2001. The Taliban finances its activities in part through the illegal opium trade. One of the biggest challenges facing the NATO mission in Afghanistan is attacking the Taliban while limiting civilian casualties. On Sunday, 12 civilians died in a rocket attack by coalition troops. Three other Afghan civilians were killed by NATO in separate incidents on Sunday and Monday. On Tuesday, Abawi spoke to one civilian whose property had been destroyed in the initial push by Marines. Despite that, he said he was happy to see Americans arrive and noted that Marines promised to pay for the damages to his home. He said Afghans have suffered under the Taliban, who he said had beheaded some people and forced their way into people's homes for food.","Operation Moshtarak focuses on area where heroin produced, Taliban has shadow government .

"(CNN) -- The scrolling list of online student activities for Tuesday, April 20, lists a spring play rehearsal, a talk by ""famous photographer, John Fielder"" -- and ""NO SCHOOL."" It's a tough day to be within those walls. It was there, 11 years ago, that Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold embarked on a massacre -- shooting 12 classmates and a teacher dead and injuring 23 others before turning the gun on themselves. Columbine High School was forever etched into the psyche of America. The top news story of 1999. An iconic shooting. An event prompted intense debate over gun control. ""A day that changed us forever,"" as former President Bill Clinton said at 10th anniversary observances last year. Clinton, who was in the White House at the time of the killings, said he was personally inspired by the courage of the Columbine community. Tuesday marks anniversary number 11, an odd-year milestone that millions of Americans will let come and go without notice. But for the survivors, for the victims' families and friends, time's steady march is not enough to dull the pain. The memories are still raw in Littleton, Colorado. Principal Frank DeAngelis attended a teary prom last weekend when Columbine crowned a king and queen with special needs. An act of goodwill and fraternity. An act exemplifying the human spirit. ""This,"" DeAngelis told CNN affiliate KMGH in Denver, is what Columbine is all about."" In far away Dallas, Texas, Jordan Niland, 17, said he is sure to pick up his telephone Tuesday. He will dial the number of Richard Castaldo. Castaldo, a junior at Columbine in 1999, suffered five gunshot wounds to his chest, back, arm and colon that left him paralyzed from the waist down. Niland was a young boy then. But after seeing Michael Moore's documentary, ""Bowling for Columbine,"" he struck up a MySpace conversation with Castaldo. The two have been friends since."" ""The anniversary means so much to me,"" Niland said. ""I have had the privilege to talk and get to know a survivor and to fully understand what really went on that day."" If people could personally hear Castaldo's story, Niland said, they would stop to reflect on this day. Because such a horror, he said, should not be forgotten. And because life goes on. A Columbine memorial dedicated in 2007, is sure to be visited Tuesday. But like the tragedy itself, the memorial, meant as a place of reflection, is incomplete, gaps running through it like the voids in people's lives. The memorial park has posted a wish list to complete the peace it is intended to bestow. Hackberry trees, lavender mist, spirea, purple asters. And 24 columbines. Any variety will do, the memorial's website says. As long as they are columbines.","Columbine High School will be closed on day of anniversary .

"(CNN) -- Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, the Afghan Taliban commander whose capture was made public this week, is one of the most senior figures in the movement to be seized -- second only to Taliban leader Mullah Mohammed Omar. Baradar was Afghanistan's deputy defense minister when the Taliban controlled the country, according to the U.N. committee in charge of sanctions on al Qaeda and Taliban members. In recent years, he has been a senior military commander and a member of the Taliban's governing Quetta Council, the committee said. He has been ""very much in control of the military operation in Afghanistan, responsible for appointing the commanders"" on the ground, said M.J. Gohel, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Foundation, a think tank focusing on security. ""Baradar is known to have had a very close relationship with Osama bin Laden in the past,"" Gohel said. ""If anyone would know where the senior leaders are of al Qaeda and the Taliban, then Baradar is someone who would be privy to that kind of information."" Afghanistan Crossroads blog: More on Baradar and the Taliban . It was critical to keep his capture secret at first, Gohel said. It is not clear exactly when he was detained in the Pakistani city of Karachi. But Reva Bhalla, director of analysis at the Stratfor think tank, said she doubted he could lead the CIA straight to those who are most wanted. ""It's not like you have one guy, and that immediately opens the door to everyone else,"" she said, adding that the Taliban guard information carefully because the militant group knows its members could be captured. Baradar was cagey about his contacts with his superior in an interview that Newsweek magazine said it conducted with him by e-mail last year. Asked if he was ""in direct contact with Mullah Omar,"" he responded, ""Continuous contacts are not risk-free because of the situation. [But we] get his advice on important topics."" He appeared to consider the possibility of breaking ties between the Taliban and al Qaeda if it would get the Americans out of Afghanistan. ""Our decisions are made on the basis of our national interests,"" Baradar said, according to Newsweek. He could be replaced by a more radical figure, said Rand Corp. analyst Arturo Munoz. ""Mullah Zakir is actually notorious because he was in Guantanamo for six years, and then he was released and immediately returned to Afghanistan and rejoined the Taliban,"" Munoz said. ""He left Guantanamo very much more radicalized, and I think Mullah Zakir is actually much more radical than Mullah Baradar, and much more dogmatic and much more in the al Qaeda mindset."" Stratfor's Bhalla said the capture could be important for what it shows about U.S.-Pakistani ties, regardless of its effects on the battlefield or the hunt for bin Laden. ""It's hard to believe that this will lead to this huge intelligence coup, but if the Pakistanis are shifting their mode of cooperating [with the United States] that is significant,"" Bhalla said. ""Pakistan didn't do this for free -- they are going to be asking for some very concrete concessions"" from the United States, she said. She noted reports that Baradar represented Omar in secret negotiations brokered by Saudi Arabia. ""Baradar is one of the main mediators,"" she said. Pakistan's cooperation with the U.S. in capturing him may be its way of telling Washington to deal with Islamabad -- not Saudi Arabia -- if it wants to negotiate with the Afghan Taliban, she said. ""The Saudis have been very involved in back-channel talks, and Pakistan wants to show it is the only one that has the real leverage and intelligence to wield carrots and sticks,"" she said. It is not clear that the Saudi-brokered talks are still going on. ""The Taliban leadership through Mullah Baradar engaged with the Saudis by conducting talks with Saudi intelligence chief, Muqrin,"" Mehlaqa Samdani of the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote last week. ""These talks came to an abrupt halt when in mid-2009, Prince Muqrin was told point-blank that Mullah Omar decided to discontinue all negotiations [since he] took it as an affront that on the one hand Washington aimed to engage the Taliban through Saudi Arabia, while on the other hand it planned to continue all efforts to defeat the Taliban through its troop surge and drone strikes,"" Samdani wrote in ""Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and prospects for peace with the Taliban."" The Pakistani Inter-Services Intelligence, or ISI, must have known Baradar's location and turned a blind eye for some time, Bhalla said. ""He was hanging out in southern Karachi with ISI knowledge. He wasn't really posing a threat to Pakistan,"" she said. Baradar has been under U.N. sanctions since February 2001, with his assets frozen and travel banned. The United Nations also forbids selling weapons to him. He was born around 1968 in the village of Weetmak in Afghanistan's Uruzgan province, according to the world body. ""Baradar,"" which means brother in Afghanistan's Dari language, appears to be a nickname. CNN's Richard Allen Greene, Joe Sterling, Dick Uliano and Ben Wedeman contributed to this report.","Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar in control of military operation in Afghanistan, experts say .

"(CNN) -- The story of how I became a national figure in the media is widely known, but few people know what I actually did for the CIA. I was a covert operations officer specializing in nuclear counter proliferation -- essentially, making sure the bad guys didn't get the bomb. My job was to create and run operations that sought to peer into the procurement networks and acquisition chains of rogue nations. It was intense, tactical, creative and demanding. I believed that there was no more important work to be done. I resigned from the CIA in 2006 because it was no longer possible to do the covert work for which I was highly trained and which I loved. This happened because in 2003, my covert identity was revealed in retaliation against my husband, Ambassador Joe Wilson, who wrote an op-ed piece in which he accused the White House of distorting the intelligence that was used to draw us into the Iraq war. But I did not lose my belief that the danger of nuclear terrorism was the most urgent threat we face. Nor did I lose my passion for working, albeit in a new way, to address that threat. I am working on this issue now as part of the international Global Zero movement, in which political, military and faith leaders, experts and activists strive for the worldwide elimination of all nuclear weapons. We know that terrorist groups have been trying to buy, build or steal a bomb. In the past two decades, there have been at least 25 instances of nuclear explosive materials being lost or stolen. There is enough highly enriched uranium, or HEU, in the world today to build more than 100,000 bombs. Terrorists looking to buy or steal HEU could look to the approximately 40 countries with nuclear weapons materials. And then there are rogue individuals out there who are running black markets selling nuclear materials and technology. Pakistan's Dr. A. Q. Khan did it for years before my group at the CIA brought him down in December 2003 after catching him red-handed selling a full-scale nuclear bomb to Moammar Gadhafi's regime in Libya. If terrorists manage to get their hands on enough HEU, they could smuggle it into a target city, build a bomb and explode it. A hundred pounds of highly enriched uranium could fit in a shoebox, and 100,000 shipping containers come into the United States every day. The nuclear threat is not limited to terrorism. There are also the dangers of proliferation and accidental or unauthorized nuclear launch. Today, nine countries have more than 23,000 nuclear weapons, and the U.S. and Russia still maintain thousands of nuclear weapons on hair-trigger alert, poised for launch within a few minutes. The only way to eliminate the danger that nuclear weapons will be used by countries in conflict, by accident or by terrorists is to lock down all nuclear materials and eliminate all nuclear weapons in all countries: global zero. Today we have a real opportunity to set the course to global zero. U.S. President Obama and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev, whose countries have 22,000 nuclear weapons or 96 percent of the world's stockpile, are signing an agreement to reduce their strategic nuclear arsenals by a third each. This is the most significant arms reduction treaty in two decades and a crucial first step. Next week, Obama is hosting the leaders of 48 countries at a summit in Washington to address the global nuclear threat and initiate programs to secure all nuclear materials worldwide. With the U.S. and Russia leading the way, 2010 could mark the beginning of the end of nuclear weapons. But achieving global zero will take years, a realistic plan of action and tremendous amounts of political will. In February, leaders of the Global Zero movement met in Paris, France, and outlined a step-by-step plan to eliminate all remaining nuclear weapons. The plan, backed by hundreds of former heads-of-state, foreign ministers, national security advisers and military commanders, calls in its first phase for the U.S. and Russia to cut their arsenals to 1,000 total warheads each. All other countries with nuclear weapons would freeze their arsenals, and the international community would conduct an all-out global effort to block the further spread of nuclear weapons and to secure all nuclear materials. Locking down nuclear bomb-making materials involves building secure facilities for storage, accounting for all stockpiles, guarding materials in transit (transportation being the most vulnerable to terrorist attack and seizure), regulating exports, interdicting smuggling operations, ending production of new bomb materials and ultimately eliminating existing stockpiles. These steps would be followed by the first multilateral negotiations in history for reductions by all nuclear weapons countries. I'm proud to be working with the Global Zero movement and its team of world leaders and grass-roots organizers, presidents and college kids. I want to do everything I can to raise public and political support for the elimination of nuclear weapons. And that is why I said yes when Lawrence Bender, producer of ""An Inconvenient Truth,"" ""Good Will Hunting"" and ""Inglorious Basterds,"" asked me to be in an extraordinary and chilling documentary film, ""Countdown to Zero,"" which premiered in January at the Sundance Film Festival to critical acclaim and will be released in U.S. theaters in July. The film will be a stunning wake-up call to citizens and our political leaders about the urgent threats posed by nuclear weapons, including proliferation, nuclear terrorism and accidental nuclear launch. It will build awareness and support for the Global Zero movement to eliminate nuclear weapons. Based on my experience in the field, I believe that if governments don't act now to begin eliminating all remaining nuclear weapons, we will witness in our lifetime the use of the bomb by a country or terrorist group. To get governments to act, everyone needs to get involved, to make their voices heard, to bring this issue to the top of the political agenda, to everyone's kitchen table and to the front pages of every blog and every newspaper. There is still time to change direction and set our course to global zero, but the clock is ticking. To learn more about the issue and get involved in the growing movement, go to globalzero.org and sign the declaration. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Valerie Plame Wilson.","Valerie Plame Wilson is a former CIA officer who worked to stop spread of nuclear materials .

"(CNN) -- BMW Oracle won the America's Cup as victory in Sunday's second race off Valencia against Swiss holders Alinghi gave them an unassailable 2-0 lead in the best-of-three series. The syndicate, founded by software magnate Larry Ellison, is the first American team to win yachting's most prestigious trophy since 1992. Ellison was on board as they clinched victory by a margin of five minutes and 26 seconds, underlining their superiority against Alinghi, who made a series of uncharacteristic errors in both races off the Spanish coast. ""It's an absolutely awesome feeling. I couldn't be more proud,"" said the 65-year-old billionaire, who fought a lengthy legal battle to earn the right to challenge the Swiss syndicate. The victory means the Golden Gate Yacht Club of San Francisco will now defend the America's Cup in the 34th staging of an event which dates back to 1851. Oracle have held the technological edge in both races, with a radical 223ft (68 meters) wingspan on their catamaran. Alinghi, who won the trophy with a 5-2 win over Team New Zealand in Valencia in 2007, dropped a possible protest after the second race as the result was confirmed. Light winds meant the start of Sunday's race was delayed for six hours, but when racing got underway Alinghi were again at a disadvantage having been penalized before the start, as in Friday's defeat. But with Ernesto Bertarelli at the helm, Alinghi held an early lead of over 600 meters before Oracle established a winning advantage of their own, touching speeds of 30 knots on the 39-nautical mile course.","BMW Oracle take a winning 2-0 lead in the best-of-three America's Cup series .

"Los Angeles, California (CNN)  -- Roy Edward Disney, the nephew of Walt Disney, died Wednesday after a yearlong battle with stomach cancer, according to a Walt Disney Co. spokesman. Disney ""played a key role in the revitalization of the Walt Disney Co. and Disney's animation legacy,"" the company said. He died in a Newport Beach, California, hospital at the age of 79. His father -- Roy O. Disney -- co-founded the Disney entertainment business with Walt Disney in 1923. Roy E. Disney's 56-year association with the company culminated in 2003 when he stepped down as vice chairman of Disney's board and chairman of the Disney Studio's Animation Department. He kept the title director emeritus and consultant in recent years, the company said. ""As head of Disney Animation, Disney helped to guide the studio to a new golden age of animation with an unprecedented string of artistic and box office successes that included 'The Little Mermaid,' 'Beauty and the Beast,' 'Aladdin' and 'The Lion King,' "" the company said. A private funeral service and cremation are planned, the company said. His ashes will be scattered at sea, it said. He was born in in Los Angeles seven years after his father and uncle began building the Disney empire. His entertainment career began in 1952 -- after he attended Harvard University and Pomona College -- with a job as an assistant film editor on the ""Dragnet"" TV series. He joined the family business a year later as an assistant film editor at the Walt Disney Studios. He received two Oscar nominations. One was as a writer and production associate on the 1959 short subject film ""Mysteries of the Deep,"" and the second was for his work in 2003 as executive producer of ""Destino,"" a film based on storyboards and original art by the iconic artist Salvador Dali. Disney founded Shamrock Holdings, an investment company owned by the Disney family, in 1978. He also was an avid competitive sailor, the company said. He held several elapsed-time records for offshore races in the Pacific Ocean, including multiple wins in the 2,225-mile Transpac race between Hawaii and California, it said. CNN's Brittany Kaplan contributed to this report.","Roy Edward Disney dies at 79 after battle with stomach cancer .

"(CNN) -- A massive iceberg -- more than twice the size of New York's Manhattan island -- is drifting slowly toward Australia, scientists said Wednesday. The iceberg, measuring 140 square km (54 square miles), cleaved off an ice shelf nearly 10 years ago and had been floating near Antarctica before commencing on its unusual journey north. Named B17B, it was about 1,700 km (1,056 miles) off the coast of West Australia, according to the country's Antarctic Division. ""B17B is a very significant one in that it has drifted so far north while still largely intact,"" said Australian Antarctic Division glaciologist Neal Young, who spotted the slab using satellite images taken by NASA and the European Space Agency. ""It's one of the biggest sighted at those latitudes."" It is unlikely to drift too close to the coast in its current form, Young said. The warmer waters will cause it to melt. ""As the water warms up, the iceberg is slowly breaking up, resulting in hundreds more smaller icebergs in the area,"" Young said on the Australian Antarctic Division Web site. In November, an iceberg estimated to be 500 meters wide and 50 meters high was spotted close to Macquarie Island in the southern Pacific drifting towards New Zealand. Scientists working on the island were astounded by its size. ""We pulled out the binoculars that we use for work on the seals and, sure enough, it was a huge floating island of ice basically and, yeah, it was an incredible sight,"" Australian researcher Dean Miller told CNN affiliate TVNZ. The Australian Antarctic Division said the iceberg was part of a flotilla that would have broken off from a larger ice flow that possibly came from the Ross Ice Shelf, Antarctica's largest. Although shipping lanes in this region are not particularly busy in November, the icebergs prompted Maritime New Zealand to issue navigation warnings. Three years earlier, another family of icebergs led to a small tourist boom when they drifted along the east coast of New Zealand's South Island. Oceanographer Mike Williams told Radio New Zealand the icebergs had ""pretty much the same origin"" but that some had probably been trapped in the icy seas of Antarctica for longer, before being carried north by the currents. However he was reluctant to cite global warming as the reason for the large-scale movement of ice. ""We do have to a change our position a little because in 2006 we thought this was a 'once in a lifetime' event. ""But large ice shelf carvings, where the ice comes from, are still only carving on a 30 to 50-year period.""","The iceberg, measuring 140 square km cleaved off an ice shelf nearly 10 years ago .

"(CNN) -- For Nadya Suleman, being in the spotlight is a double-edged sword. The media have invaded her privacy and turned her into a carnival attraction, she told Oprah Winfrey on Tuesday. But Suleman also acknowledges that the media has also become a source of income for her, a single mother of 14 children. ""That [Star magazine] photo shoot was $100,000,"" Suleman said on Winfrey's show via satellite from California, referring to the January cover that depicted her ""bikini body."" ""I was ashamed of that -- that's not my character -- but I felt as though I needed to do something,"" she said. ""I did it because there were 14 hungry mouths. I own full responsibility for providing for my children. We have some of that money left until I figure out another way to make ends meet."" At this point, with eight 14-month old babies and six other children between the ages of 3 and 8, one of whom has autism, Suleman doesn't appear to have the time to take up a full-time job. She does have three nannies who help her during the day in shifts. But even so, Suleman says she is constantly counting heads, making bottles or keeping a child from hurting another, as was revealed when Winfrey's camera crew spent 24 hours in her home. ""You're so busy trying to keep up, you don't have time to think, reflect or feel anything,"" she told Winfrey. ""You can't regret children, but [my] choices were childish, immature and selfish. I wasn't thinking at that time."" At the start of the interview, Winfrey made it clear that Harpo Productions, her multimedia company, didn't pay Suleman ""a dime"" and, in fact, Suleman approached Winfrey to tell her side of the story. ""Everything that [the media] have said so far about me, and about me wanting to do this on purpose -- I never wanted to use children for fame,"" Suleman said, adding that her rationale for implanting eight embryos at one time stemmed from a variety of factors. There was what she calls ""a childish desire to have a large family,"" and ""perhaps selfishness, trying to compensate for being an only child, trying to fill some missing piece inside,"" she said. ""I believe I've always coveted that connection, that attachment to another human being, and it felt safer with children than a significant other,"" Suleman added. Suleman emphasized repeatedly to Winfrey that she's determined to take care of her brood on her own, without government assistance and without turning to adoption or foster care. ""I will do everything as a mother to avoid that at all costs,"" she told Winfrey, although she said she would never consider a reality TV show, which she considers exploitative and borderline abusive, or doing porn, despite having received three offers since the birth of her octuplets. Yet Suleman did appear in a two-hour Fox special that documented the first six months of her octuplets' lives and aired on the network in August 2009. Around that time, there were reports that Suleman had signed on to do a reality show with U.K. production company Eyeworks. However, Suleman said that she ""would never do a reality show, that's been a lie from the beginning."" She told Winfrey that she has ""been ashamed of myself to go through certain media outlets to provide for my children,"" before adding, ""this was my choice and my responsibility, and I didn't want to depend on anyone."" As a result, Suleman said she lives ""every single day, every hour of the day, with a tremendous amount of guilt. I feel guilty when I look at the older ones, they all have different unique needs,"" she told Winfrey. ""I feel guilty when I'm holding one or two and I can't be there for the others when they're crying."" Regardless of the way she markets her ""Octomom"" identity, Suleman said the biggest misconception people have about her is that she did it all for fame. ""I'm not a celebrity. I'm a pseudo-celebrity catapulted into this media mess,"" she said. ""Was I in denial thinking it wouldn't happen? Yeah. Did I want it? No.""","On Tuesday's ""Oprah Winfrey Show,"" Nadya Suleman revealed what her life is like .

Authorities will file criminal charges if the investigation determines that they are warranted, a spokesman said Tuesday. ""If someone breaks the law in Richland County, we have an obligation as law enforcement to investigate and to bring charges,"" Sheriff Leon Lott said in a statement. ""The Richland County Sheriff's Department is making an effort to determine if Mr. Phelps broke the law. If he did, he will be charged in the same manner as anyone else. The sheriff has a responsibility to be fair, to enforce the law and to not turn a blind eye because someone is a celebrity."" Phelps admitted ""regrettable behavior"" on Sunday after a British newspaper published a photograph of him smoking through a bong. The tabloid News of the World showed Phelps using the bong during what it said was a November party at the University of South Carolina, in Richland County. Both university police and Columbia, South Carolina, police have said they would not pursue charges, according to The State newspaper in Columbia. It was unclear where the party took place, the paper said, or whether it was on the USC campus. ""I engaged in behavior which was regrettable and demonstrated bad judgment,"" said Phelps, who won a record eight gold medals at the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, China, in a statement Sunday.  See the photo on the cover of Star magazine » . ""I'm 23 years old, and despite the successes I have had in the pool, I acted in a youthful and inappropriate way, not in a manner that people have come to expect from me,"" he said. ""For this, I am sorry. I promise my fans and the public -- it will not happen again."" The U.S. Olympic Committee also issued a statement that said in part, ""Michael has acknowledged that he made a mistake and apologized for his actions. We are confident that, going forward, Michael will consistently set the kind of example we all expect from a great Olympic champion."" In 2004, Phelps was arrested on charges of driving under the influence in Salisbury, Maryland. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 18 months probation. He also issued an apology after that incident. Phelps is one of 12 Olympic athletes who have signed on to ""My Victory,"" an initiative launched last year by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency aimed at keeping competitive sports clean.","Charges will be filed if warranted, sheriff's spokesman says .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- If treating heroin addicts by giving them heroin seems counterintuitive, having the government fund that addiction to the tune of more than $22,000 per patient per year comes across as downright radical. A heroin addict identified as Sarah says the program had an almost immediate affect on her life. A newly released British study, however, found that daily heroin injections given to hard-to-treat addicts as part of a comprehensive program succeeded in treating those addicts and reducing crime. The use of street heroin was reduced by three quarters and the crimes committed trying to get drugs were cut by two-thirds, the study found. ""The intensity of the program is quite striking,"" said John Strang, who led the research team at Britain's National Addiction Centre, associated with King's College in London. ""The bond that is formed and the commitment that's established between the patient coming in for treatment and the staff is far greater than you would ever ordinarily see."" Taking heroin off the streets seems to be making a difference. Researchers injected heroin in a safe, stable environment at medically supervised clinics. They crucially paired that with intensive counseling and addiction treatment. The researchers reported that benefits were evident just six weeks into treatment among users who had failed at other kinds of treatment. One of those participants was ""Sarah,"" who said that after coping with her addiction for more than 20 years, she lost hope that anything would work.  Watch Sarah describe the program » . Sarah described how the program had an almost immediate affect on her life. She said she was able to keep a schedule, stop buying drugs on the street and gain an appreciation of what her life could be like if she wasn't so consumed by getting high. ""You'll always be an addict basically; it's about managing it and leading a positive life"" said Sarah, adding, ""It quickly became, well, I actually do want to stop. I don't really want to have to stick needles in me all my life."" Her biggest fear now is that the program will be cut or shut down if the government deems it too controversial. Another patient, who asked to be identified as ""Emma,"" said, ""The morality of it was taken out of the question. I wasn't being condemned for it and at last I could start taking responsibility in a rational way."" Emma described being chaotic, confused, emaciated and always dreaming about her next fix. By contrast, she said, the program made her feel cared for, supported and, above all, confident that she could kick the heroin habit. ""This thing that was the meaning of your life is becoming the thing that is getting in the way of your life and it becomes very unattractive,"" she said. Strang said the stubborn nature of heroin addiction is proof that getting addicts into treatment is really a shallow achievement, because many will eventually turn to drugs again. He believes this promising approach could change the way hard-to-treat addicts are treated and convince the government that the initial high cost offers good value. ""From the cost point of view, if you actually look at the bigger picture, cheap treatment isn't always good treatment. If cheap treatment doesn't deliver any benefit then it's particularity bad value,"" Strang said. The reduction in crime found by the study mirrors results in a handful of studies in other countries. The treatment is relatively expensive, about $22,000 per patient, per year. But in Britain many are coming to terms with the fact that keeping a person in prison can cost three times that. If the encouraging results continue, Britain could one day set up permanent clinics around the country, dispensing heroin for its most hard-to-treat addicts.","British program gives daily injections to addicts as part of a comprehensive program .

"(CNN) -- When Command Sgt. Maj. Michael T. Hall of the International Security Assistance Force announced that fast-food offerings like Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen and Orange Julius were being shuttered in Afghanistan, he was blunt about it. ""This is a warzone, not an amusement park,"" he wrote on the ISAF blog. These mobile restaurants and others that can be found on large bases in Kandahar and Bagram, are ""nonessentials"" and are being shut down to streamline delivery of much-needed battlefield supplies. However, according to some soldiers and Marines -- all of whom have served in combat in Iraq or Afghanistan -- access to the familiar hometown mall fare isn't as important to morale as many civilians may have thought. The veterans and active-duty troops all said that access to healthy foods, local cuisine and packages of snacks sent by friends and family trumped military base fast food as morale boosters. The announcement of the fast-food outposts' shuttering inspired a lively debate on CNN's Afghanistan blog about morale and the amenities afforded servicemen and women serving overseas -- often in harm's way. Those affected, however, didn't seem very concerned. ""The big things that improve morale in a combat zone are lots of letters and packages from loved ones,"" Marine Cpl. David Brian Crouch said. Especially appreciated in these care packages are sweet, sour, salty and spicy condiments, such as Tabasco, sugar packets and seasoned salts for enlivening the military's frequently derided Meals Ready to Eat -- individually packaged rations for service members stationed away from meal preparation facilities. These high-calorie MREs, which have long drawn criticism for depressingly bland flavors and textures, are precisely what Crouch, who served two tours in Iraq, says drove his fellow troops to seek out more flavorful, familiar fast food. Others look a little closer to their temporary home, sampling the local fare. While many soldiers out on combat patrols were, according to Army Capt. David Swaintek, ""too tired and drained to care much about their meal,"" he developed a taste for Iraqi flavors during his tour, which lasted from 2002 to 2008. While he stands up for food on base, calling it ""decent"" and ""healthier"" than fast-food alternatives, he still misses his favorite flatbread, which he'd buy while out on patrol, and he laments not being able to find anything like it stateside. Similarly adventurous, previously deployed Marines now at California's Camp Pendeleton don't have to venture far from their barracks to indulge in the Middle Eastern-style specialties they've come to love. According to the Marine Corps Times, DedeMed's Shawarma House now serves the eponymous gyro-like sandwich -- as well as hummus, tabbouleh salad and baklava -- to Marines who'd been stationed in Iraq and the Persian Gulf. Swaintek, while lauding the indigenous cuisine, also cried foul about fatty U.S. fast foods, saying that ""overweight soldiers are a problem."" Army Sgt. Paul Williams, who is serving in Iraq, agrees with the captain but indulges in ""the occasional pizza from Pizza Hut, burrito from Taco Bell, or maybe even a sandwich from Subway,"" citing the virtue of being able to enjoy a pizza in the middle of the desert and escape for a few minutes to talk with fellow soldiers about their homes, sweethearts or future plans. Ultimately, though, the military is a culture of intense physical fitness, and access to nutritious meals at mess halls helps servicemen and women maintain their physical and psychological. edge. And Williams says that ""a soldier has a responsibility to maintain himself."" While deployed troops can certainly take the reins of their physical health, friends and family stateside can still boost morale and offer a taste of home with much-appreciated care packages. The Department of Defense maintains a list of links to groups coordinating care packages for overseas soldiers. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, most foods that are tightly prepackaged and immune to mold or bacterial growth are safe for sending to soldiers. They recommend dried proteins, like beef and turkey jerky, as well as dehydrated soups, dried fruits and even dense baked goods like fruitcakes. Just make sure to seal it all up with a kiss.","Military closing mobile Pizza Hut, Dairy Queen, Orange Julius, other outlets in Afghanistan .

"(CNN) -- African-American farmers hoping for government settlement money in a racial bias case met with lawmakers Wednesday and called on Congress to come up with a way to fund the $1 billion deal. Litigation known as the Pigford Case established a longstanding pattern of discrimination at the U.S. Agriculture Department against African-American farmers who had applied for farm loans and support from federal programs. Under the terms of an involved process overseen by a federal judge and dating to 1999, qualified farmers could receive $50,000 each to settle claims of racial bias. In addition, U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack has said those farmers may pursue a claim for actual damages from the bias and potentially receive up to $250,000. Ralph Paige, executive director of the Federation of Southern Cooperatives/Land Assistance Fund, said Wednesday that he believed that Congress was ""very close"" to coming up with a way to pay the settlement, which covers as many as 80,000 African-American farmers. ""These farmers have suffered much, much too long, and it's time that this thing get behind us. We can settle Pigford once and for all and send a clear message to the country that we are on the right track as a nation,"" Paige said at news conference. ""We're talking about much more than the money. We are talking about remedying past discrimination,"" Paige said. A March 31 deadline to appropriate the funds has passed, and farmers now may withdraw from the settlement and pursue independent litigation against the government. Congress now has a target date of the end of May to come up with a plan. ""We spend a billion dollars on a jet to go bomb somebody. We're talking about a billion dollars to help feed our country, and I just don't see why Congress and the president can't go ahead and find [the funds]. It is an emergency,"" said Gary Grant, with the Black Farmers and Agriculturalists Association. Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, said there is a ""total commitment"" from President Obama and the majority party in the House and Senate to make sure the settlement is taken care of. Butterfield represents his state's First Congressional District, which is home to Timothy Pigford, who filed the class-action lawsuit more than a decade ago. Butterfield said lawmakers need to work out how to pay for the settlement under the PAYGO rule, meaning Congress must balance any increased spending with equal savings elsewhere. The other option would be to designate the settlement as an emergency, which would be exempt from PAYGO. Lawmakers are looking for an appropriate piece of legislation in which to include the settlement to avoid adding to the deficit, Butterfield said. ""If we cannot find the appropriate vehicle, then I would certainly support declaring this settlement as a national emergency and adding it to the next supplemental that may be on the House floor,"" he said. Farmers have until May 31 to withdraw from the pending class-action settlement and pursue an independent claim against the government if they feel their chances would be better for a payout. If they choose to stay in the class, they will wait as a group to apply for the promised monetary damages. Vilsack has said there's no question the damages are due for African-American farmers. In a statement last week, he said, ""I have met with and talked to key stakeholders and members of Congress reiterating the administration's ongoing efforts to close this chapter in the history of the department."" CNN's Paul Courson and Kristi Keck contributed to this report.","Advocates say lawmakers are on their side, but they want them to speed up the process .

"(CNN) -- President Obama will deliver a eulogy on Sunday for the 29 workers killed in a mine explosion in West Virginia. Before the service in Beckley, the president and Vice President Joe Biden will meet privately with the miners' relatives. ""All the hard work. All the hardship. All the time spent underground. It was all for their families. For a car in the driveway. For a roof overhead. For a chance to give their kids opportunities they never knew; and enjoy retirement with their wives,"" Obama will say in his eulogy, according to excerpts that the White House made available. ""It was all in the hopes of something better. These miners lived -- as they died -- in pursuit of the American dream."" The April 5 blast at the Upper Big Branch Mine was the worst U.S. mine disaster since 1972, when 91 miners died in a fire at the Sunshine Mine in Kellogg, Idaho. Obama ordered a review, saying the mine explosion was due in part to failures by both the management and loopholes in existing laws and regulations. ""We cannot bring back the men we lost. What we can do, in their memory, is thoroughly investigate this tragedy and demand accountability,"" the president said soon after the explosion. Obama called Massey Energy Co., the coal producer that owns the mine, a ""safety violator"" and described the safety record at the mine as ""troubled."" Massey Energy later called Obama's criticism ""regrettable"" and defended its safety record. ""We fear that the president has been misinformed about our record and the mining industry in general,"" the company said.","President Obama to attend memorial service for West Virginia miners killed in explosion .

"Havana, Cuba -- Alejandro Robaina, considered a legend among Cuban tobacco growers, died Saturday, according to Cuban cigar company Habanos S.A., which produced cigars named for him. Robaina was 91. He was diagnosed with cancer last year and died on his farm in the western Cuban province of Pinar del Rio, said Habanos spokesman Jose Antonio Candia. Robaina's tobacco leaves are considered some of the best in the world. In Cuba, he was called ""The Godfather."" His deeply wrinkled face smiled out from billboards, T-shirts and boxes of Vegas Robaina cigars, among Cuba's finest. A box of premium Vegas Robaina cigars can fetch more than $500 on the international market. But the man behind the smile was also a simple country farmer who got up at the crack of dawn every day to survey his fields until cancer slowed him down. ""I wouldn't say I've triumphed, but I've done something with my life,"" he told CNN in 2008. ""The first thing is to love the land, take care of the land."" Robaina's family have farmed tobacco continuously since 1845 on the plantation. Under Robaina, business flourished, and the plantation had some of the best yields in the region, producing highly-prized wrapper leaves used for the outer layer of cigars. Cigar aficionados around the globe called him the dean of Cuba's cigar industry and every year thousands of visitors made the two-hour trek from Havana, hoping to share a stogie and a glass of rum with ""the Don."" Robaina kept his lands even when many ranches were nationalized after the 1959 revolution led by Fidel Castro. ""I had a very strong conversation with Fidel 18 or 20 years ago,"" Robaina said in 2008. ""He asked if I would join a big cooperative since I had so many workers, and I told him no. ""For me tobacco growing had to be in the family, done with love. Because in the big cooperatives, everyone's the boss, nobody worries as much as the grower."" Now, almost all of Cuba's tobacco farms are private, according to the Agriculture Ministry. And they generally take their lead from Robaina, planting and harvesting on the same days he did. ""I like to sow during a waxing moon, and harvest in a waning moon,"" he said. Robaina said he'd been smoking cigars since he was 10 years old. ""When I get really old, I'll stop smoking the strong stuff,"" he said. In 1997, Cuba launched the Vegas Robaina brand, named in his honor. They're made from the golden wrapper leaves grown on Robaina's plantation but are rolled in a separate factory. Like most of Cuba's cigars, they're largely exported. Because of the U.S. trade embargo, however, Cuban cigars are off-limits in America. Robaina said in 2008 he hoped that policy would end during his lifetime. ""Of course I have hope they'll open up the market,"" he said. ""Cuba's willing to send cigars and they're willing to smoke them. They're going crazy because they can't smoke cigars from here."" Robaina will be buried Sunday, said Candia.","Robaina, who was diagnosed with cancer last year, died on his farm in Pinar del Rio .

"Washington (CNN) -- You may drive a hybrid car, eat organic food, use ""green"" beauty products and design your home according to the latest environmentally friendly standards. But if you haven't considered ""greening your love life, you are still a total environmental disaster,"" according to Stefanie Iris Weiss, author of the recently released book, ""Eco-Sex."" How should it work? Should you envision melting glaciers during a romantic dinner with your significant other? Well, not quite. It could be as simple as where you choose to go on a date. ""How about going to a restaurant where you can eat a seductive menu based on organic, local food, which has produced less carbon dioxide before it ends up on your plate?"" Weiss suggested. She is hoping to steer people away from ""dirty"" sex toward eco-sex. That means: . • Hop on your bike for your next date and leave your car at home. (That means saying ""adieu"" to long-distance relationships.) • Stop excessive spending on Valentine's Day. (It produces way too much trash anyway.) • Wear comfy bamboo underwear. • Don't be so keen on having babies. How about adopting a child instead or implementing a one-child policy? Weiss' theory is not entirely new. Greenpeace published a guide to ""environmentally friendly sex"" in 2002, which includes ""switching off the lights during romance"" or ""if you want to see your partner, have sex during the day."" But Weiss goes further: She covers everything from your first date to raising your kids ""green."" She also suggests keeping the environment in mind when your sex drive is fading. Viagra, she says, is overrated. ""People should eat oysters as an aphrodisiac instead,"" Weiss says. ""They are a full of zinc, a precursor of testosterone. Casanova himself was known to eat them in great quantities before sex."" On the streets of Washington, the idea of an eco-friendly love life is met with laughter. ""How green is my love life? Are you serious? Don't be absurd!"" were the most common reactions from people on the street. But the concept is in full display at a local sex shop. ""We sell organic oils, edible underwear and toys that are completely recyclable,"" says Luis Cadillos, a salesman at Georgetown's ""Pleasure Place."" ""The problem is our customers are embarrassed to dispose their toys properly."" He says he thinks promoting an eco-friendly sex life could be ""big business."" ""We should have an extra shelf for our green-conscious customers,"" Cadillos suggests. His colleague, Paula Kov, is less enthusiastic about the idea. ""I try to live environmentally friendly, but it goes way over the top to think about [carbon dioxide reduction] in my love life,"" she says. Climate activist Mike Tidwell disagrees. ""I never thought about how green my love life is. But in fact this is about reducing our extensive consumption and that should concern every part of our life,"" he says. Tidwell, who is the director of Chesapeake Climate Action Network in Washington, decided long ago to have only one child. ""But I am glad the book doesn't prohibit making love outdoors,"" Tidwell joked. ""That produces zero carbon dioxide."" It's clear in Weiss' 200-page book that she is using sex to promote a completely green lifestyle. But is that such a bad thing? ""With sex anything sells. Even the environment,"" Weiss says. She says she is hoping that, in the midst of the global climate crisis debate, her book ""may finally approach those green-grumps, who don't know the basics about living an environmentally friendly life."" That doesn't seem likely after reading conservative blogger William Teach's post on her book: . ""I actually hope the climate alarmists, consisting of mostly liberals, take her advice on how to have eco-friendly sex without getting pregnant,"" Teach posted on rightwingnews.com. ""The world could use a whole lot less unhinged liberals taught by their unhinged liberal parents."" John Bargh, who teaches psychology at Yale University, sees a different problem with the eco-sex theory. Thinking about the environmental impact of your love life, he says, goes against human nature. ""Human beings are irrational,"" he says. ""We make decisions based on our desire, especially when it comes to love.""","Author Stefanie Iris Weiss wants you to make your love life green .

"(CNN) -- Now that Arizona lawmakers have passed what's considered some of the toughest immigration legislation in the country, other states are watching to see whether they should follow in the state's footsteps or stand back. Arizona's bill orders immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in the United States illegally. It also targets those who hire illegal immigrant day laborers or knowingly transport them. Critics, including immigrant advocates and the American Civil Liberties Union of Arizona, are concerned that the legislation will foster racial profiling, arguing that most police officers don't have enough training to look past race while investigating a person's legal status. The bill made it through the state Senate on Monday after it was passed by the state House last week. It's now awaiting the signature of Republican Gov. Jan Brewer. Supporters of the measure expect her to sign it. Latino members of Congress are calling on Brewer to veto it. Michael Hethmon, general counsel for the Immigration Reform Law Institute, helped draft the language of the Arizona bill. The institute is the legal affiliate of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. On the heels of the Arizona initiative, Hethmon said he has been approached by lawmakers from four other states who have asked for advice on how they can do the same thing where they live. He declined to identify the states, citing attorney-client privilege. ""Arizona was meant to be the leading edge,"" Hethmon said. ""If you are going to work on developing a state-based response to this enormous problem -- the lack of a national immigration policy -- Arizona is the place to do it."" Hethmon pointed to Arizona's history of citizen ballot initiatives in support of immigration reform, noting that ""what's happening in Arizona just didn't pop out of nowhere. It's the latest step in a fairly deliberate process."" Republican State Rep. Russell Pearce, who sponsored the legislation in Arizona, said the four initiatives he put on the 2006 ballot regarding illegal immigrants passed by an average of 75 percent. State laws relating to immigration have increased in recent years, according to numbers from the National Conference of State Legislatures. In 2005, 300 bills were introduced. The next year, that number nearly doubled, and in 2007, more than 1,500 bills were introduced. Another 1,305 were introduced in 2008, and about 1,500 were considered in 2009. About 15 percent of those were enacted, dealing with issues such as driver's licenses, health and education. About1,000 bills have been brought up so far this year. Hethmon cited the election year, the Democratic leadership's position on the issue and the tough economic times as catalysts for introducing legislation. ""Historically, not only in the U.S. but in virtually all industrialized nations, when the unemployment rates go up ... the public becomes much less sympathetic toward programs which bring in large numbers of foreigners as workers and economic players,"" he said. Whether Arizona becomes the standard-bearer on illegal immigration depends on the fate of the legislation, said Ann Morse, the program director of the National Conference of State Legislatures' Immigrant Policy Project. ""Certainly states will look at it, but not in a rush,"" she said. With court challenges promised from opponents, states will be watching to see if the legislation is deemed constitutional and if it's costly, Morse said. Omar Jadwat, the staff attorney with the ACLU's Immigrants Rights' Project, said following in Arizona's footsteps would take states in the wrong direction. ""Although we are aware that people are trying to convince other legislatures to go down this path, I think it's clear that both as a policy matter and a legal matter, that Arizona's approach is the wrong one,"" he said. Isabel Garcia, a legal defender in Arizona's Pima County, blasted the bill as ""the most dangerous precedent in this country, violating all of our due process rights."" ""We have not seen this kind of legislation since the Jim Crow laws. And targeting our communities, it is the single most largest attack on our communities,"" she said. Pearce brushed off her criticism, saying, "" 'Illegal' is not a race, it's a crime."" ""We do not tolerate those who break into our country, just like we don't tolerate those who break into our homes,"" he said. Hethmon praised the legislation as ""the most cost-effective and the most humane way to deal with the illegal immigration problem."" ""Every time you convince an illegal alien to self-deport, you bypass having to resort to direct physical deportation,"" he said. In addition to providing a model for other states, Hethmon said the legislation in Arizona and other bills in the works in other states also provide an example on the national level. ""The states are laboratories for democracy. The federal government is in gridlock,"" he said. ""We're providing models for the day when the ice breaks up on the Hill and the legislative waters flow and the country decides to confront this problem in a realistic way.""","Arizona bill requires police to question people if there's reason to suspect they're in U.S. illegally .

"(CNN) -- The international draw of its star players, the huge sums paid for rights to broadcast live action and the loyal nature of its consumers have long made the English Premier League an attractive home for investors. In recent years this has included a number of American billionaires who, having made their money with sport franchises in the United States, saw ownership of teams including Manchester United (Malcolm Glazer), Liverpool (Hicks and Gillett) and Aston Villa (Randy Lerner) as the best way to expand a global portfolio. Stan Kroenke -- owner of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, the National Hockey League's Colorado Avalanche and Major League Soccer's Colorado Rapids -- could be the next to join this elite group after a major shareholder at London-based Arsenal confirmed that she is looking to sell her stake. Kroenke already owns 29 percent of the Champions League quarterfinalists, and needs only one more percent to trigger a complete takeover. Blog: Should Stan Kroenke buy Arsenal? But with the economic downturn compounding both Liverpool and Manchester United's struggles with debt and growing fan unrest -- coupled with Kroenke's recent confirmation of a takeover bid for the St Louis Rams -- would it be wise for the American to aim his sights on owning Arsenal now? CNN's business correspondent Jim Boulden helps break down Kroenke's decision. Why invest in the English Premier League? The recent sale of their overseas television rights amounted to over $1.5 billion, while the domestic rights went for much more. This means the Premier League clubs can sign expensive players on big wages, according to Boulden. ""A lot of the league's strength is to do with Sky and its multi-billion dollar deal to show the games around the world,"" he said. ""Sky gives an enormous amount of money to Premier League clubs."" Could Kroenke expect much profit from Arsenal? Boulden says the main way to maximize profit is to keep a club healthy, and deliver success on the pitch before selling it on down the line for a profit. He said: ""I look upon Stan Kroenke like these other guys in America: the Glazers own a NFL team, the guys who own Liverpool own hockey clubs in America. They only make money if they hold onto them for a really long time and sell them."" Is Arsenal a financially healthy club? Yes, according to Boulden. He says the club had to take out a big loan to build its new stadium -- the Emirates, which opened in 2006 -- but that is being chipped away. He explained: ""There is a small section of seats at Arsenal's new ground that generates as much money on a match day as the entire former ground did. All other seats are gravy, so the amount of money they make per game is phenomenal."" The site of the former ground has been turned into flats, which has also generated a considerable amount of money, Boulden said. Boulden believes Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger's model of investing time and money into youth players is also a shrewd move. ""Arsene Wenger's theory is to buy someone when they are young and other clubs haven't even noticed them. By the time they come good, and most of them do, he would have to pay $20 million to get these guys."" He says these players can also be sold on for huge profit, like in the case of France striker Nicolas Anelka, who came through the Arsenal youth system before being sold to Real Madrid for $35 million. Would Kroenke put the club in debt to buy it, as did the owners of Manchester United and Liverpool? The Glazer family bought Manchester United by putting the debt onto the club, and their most recent accounts show they are over $1 billion in debt. Boulden says any similar move at Arsenal may not do the club any good. ""Arsenal already has a debt from the building of the new stadium, so it would be hard to see how Kroenke would get a bank to agree to give them more debt,"" he said. Does Kroenke's extra investment in the St Louis Rams limit his spending power? Boulden says Kroenke's purchase of the Rams makes it very unlikely he would also fight to acquire Arsenal at the same time: ""The fact that he has just ingested the Rams -- one of the worst teams in the NFL -- means he is going to have to spend his time and effort trying to rebuild that club. It's hard to see that he would do that and try to take over Arsenal -- that would be a lot for one person to take on.""","U.S. businessman Stan Kroenke is largest shareholder at English soccer club Arsenal .

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- Western politicians are currently scrambling for air tickets to Kiev. Britain's Foreign Secretary David Miliband rushed to Ukraine soon after Russia announced its recognition of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. U.S. Vice President Dick Cheney will follow. Ukraine's President Viktor Yuschenko has made it clear that he would welcome closer ties with the West. They want to shore up the Western-leaning President Viktor Yuschenko, amid fears that his country could become the next frontline in the power struggle between Russia and the West. It is in part a deliberate signal to an emboldened Moscow not to overreach. But EU nations will only be taking their support so far, for geographical, practical and political reasons. Conflict between Russia and Georgia, a tiny country of around 5 million citizens, was one thing. Conflict with the 47 million strong Ukraine would be a different matter, with much wider ramifications. What do you think of Russia's relationship with the West? While Georgia's President Mikhail Saakashvili, at least for the moment, seems to have the bulk of the Georgian population behind him, Ukraine is much more divided about relations with Moscow. There is a huge energy dependency. Around 17 percent of Ukraine citizens, according to the census, are ethnic Russians. Even the country's political leadership is divided. Although they were allies in Ukraine's 2004 Orange Revolution and both would like to see Ukraine in the EU, Prime Minister Yulia Tymoshenko has distanced herself from Yuschenko's eagerness to enter the embrace of NATO. She has also criticized his presidential decree restricting the movements of Russia's Ukraine-based Black Sea fleet, based in Ukraine's Crimean peninsula, where there is a heavy concentration of ethnic Russians. Yuschenko flew to Tblisi to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with Saakashvili over the conflict in Georgia, while Tymoshenko focused on calls for a cessation of hostilities. Miliband used his visit to Kiev to insist that Russia's re-drawing of the map in the Caucusus was a moment of truth for Europe, marking the end of a post-Cold War period of geopolitical calm. But significantly Miliband also urged Ukraine to avoid giving Russia a pretext to intervene in the Crimea, where Kiev accuses Russia of trying to stir up trouble -- just as Saakashvili had accused Moscow of doing in South Ossetia before launching his military assault. The Ukranian port of Sebastopol is leased to the Russian Black Sea fleet until 2017 and Yuschenko has urged that Russia should be asked for a higher rent and be subject to more restrictions. Miliband may be making the toughest warning noises he dares to Russia, but he also urged that ""the Ukrainian government should ensure that the letter of the agreements are stuck to until 2017."" In recent years Ukraine has sought an uneasy balance between courting the West and not too overtly angering Moscow. But lately Yuschenko has grown bolder, offering to co-operate in the U.S. missile defense shield in Europe, despite the chilling threats from Moscow to Poland over its planned participation. NATO and EU leaders would not want him to get much bolder than that. While a majority of Ukrainians, according to opinion polls, would like to see their country in the EU, they are sharply divided about joining NATO. Only last April EU Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso complained about the country's lack of political stability (a key qualification for membership). Disputes between president and prime minister over relations with Russia, he suggested, were holding up progress. There is a regular EU/Ukraine meeting next month and Kiev will be looking for strong signals that it will meet a favorable response over its membership aims. Miliband declared in Kiev: ""My visit is designed to send a simple message: we have not forgotten our commitments to you."" Ukraine allies like Poland will be pushing for those words to be reinforced with action, but EU commitments tend to come with rather vague timetables, and to become entangled in wider issues. Poland's prospects of speeding its membership prospects will depend on who wins the internal EU argument between those who, with an eye to their energy supplies, want to see the conflict with Russia cool down and those who want to send a strong signal to Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin and President Dmitry Medvedev, in that order, that they have already gone too far.","Western leaders heading for Ukraine to show support for pro-Western government .

"WASHINGTON (CNN)  -- New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer said Wednesday he is giving up his proposal to grant driver's licenses to undocumented workers, a plan he said would ""improve the safety and security of the people of my state."" New York Gov. Eliot Spitzer says Wednesday in Washington that opposition to his plan doomed it. Spitzer said he was giving up because he had concluded that ""New York state cannot successfully address this problem on its own."" He said he wanted to act because of the failure of the federal government to deal with immigration policy and the impact that failure was having on New York. ""I would suggest to you what everyone already knows, "" Spitzer said. ""The federal government has lost control of its borders. It has allowed millions of undocumented workers to enter our country and now has no solution to deal with them."" The effect was about 1 million undocumented workers in New York state, ""many of whom are driving without licenses,"" said Spitzer, surrounded at a news conference by members of his state's congressional delegation.   Watch Spitzer explain why he's withdrawing the proposal » . Spitzer said licensing workers who did not have Social Security numbers, which New York had done in the past, would have aided law enforcement and would have made the state's streets safer and more secure. However, Spitzer acknowledged that ""you don't need a stethoscope to hear the heartbeat of the public,"" saying he had concluded that opposition to his plan would have doomed it. ""You have polarization on this issue that has defied resolution,"" he said. Watch what a hornet's nest the proposal stirred up . Spitzer put forward his proposal in September, saying it would bring New York's estimated 1 million illegal immigrants ""out of the shadows."" In October, the governor said there would be three tiers of licenses, ranging from a license restricting travel, a document called Real ID for legal residents and a stricter one that would allow people to travel into Canada. U.S. Rep. Charles Rangel, D-New York, on Wednesday thanked Spitzer for making the effort to bring about change, noting that undocumented workers ""are part of the economy, they are part of what America's supposed to be."" ""There is no question that we lack the leadership on the national level to change the tone,"" Rangel said. ""And that is the reason why leaders all over the country -- mayors and governors -- are trying so desperately hard to deal locally with a problem that is basically a national problem."" One influential member of New York's congressional delegation missing from the briefing was Sen. Hillary Clinton, considered the front-runner in the race for the Democratic presidential nomination. A spokesman from her office said she couldn't attend the news conference because of a scheduling conflict. As the plan became a topic of national discussion, critics accused her of failing to take a definitive stance on the issue. In a debate last week, Clinton said Spitzer's plan ""makes a lot of sense"" but stopped short of endorsing it. On Wednesday, Clinton issued a written statement supporting Spitzer's decision to withdraw the proposal. ""His difficult job is made that much harder by the failure of the Congress and the White House to pass comprehensive immigration reform,"" Clinton said. ""As president, I will not support driver's licenses for undocumented people and will press for comprehensive immigration reform that deals with all of the issues around illegal immigration, including border security and fixing our broken system."" Clinton's rivals quickly pounced on her statement. A spokeswoman for Sen. Chris Dodd, D-Connecticut, called her action ""flip-flopping cubed,"" and Bill Burton, a spokesman for Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois, also sharply criticized Clinton for switching her views on the issue. ""When it takes two weeks and six different positions to answer one question on immigration, it's easier to understand why the Clinton campaign would rather plant their questions than answer them,"" Burton said. Seventy-six percent of Americans oppose giving driver's licenses to illegal immigrants, according to a poll conducted in October for CNN by the Opinion Research Corp. Members of the New York State Sheriffs' Association voted in October to oppose Spitzer's proposal. ""I believe this is just a fundamental issue of right and wrong,"" said Rep. Tom Latham, an Iowa Republican against Spitzer's plan. ""And to give people official recognition when they come in and break the law in their first act in this country is simply wrong.""

"(CNN) -- American Wayne Odesnik has accepted ""a voluntary provisional suspension"" from tennis after pleading guilty to importing human growth hormone into Australia. Odesnik, currently ranked 111th in the world, was heading for the Brisbane International tournament in January when he was stopped by customs officers. The 24-year-old pleaded guilty to taking eight vials of human growth hormone into the country at Brisbane Magistrates Court and was hit with an $8,000 fine. Odesnik has agreed to a temporary suspension, though he can decide return to the game at any time, and must wait to hear the findings of an independent tribunal after the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme has concluded its investigation of the case. A statement on the International Tennis Federation Web site said: ""Wayne Odesnik has accepted a voluntary provisional suspension from all events covered under the Tennis Anti-Doping Programme, including Grand Slam tournaments, ATP-sanctioned events and ITF-sanctioned tournaments.

"(CNN)  -- Just what is it that separates a champion athlete from the also-rans? Natural talent, hard work and determination are all essential, but athletes and coaches are becoming increasingly aware of the crucial role diet plays in sporting success. Olympic athletes are fueled by high-carb diets. Dr Samantha Stear is national lead for performance nutrition at the English Institute of Sport (EIS) and helped make the Beijing Olympics Britain's most successful games for a century. ""A good diet isn't going to turn a mediocre athlete into a champion, but a champion eating a bad diet may just miss out,"" she told CNN. Training is the key to improving athletic performance, and the right diet is the key to sustaining a punishing training regime. Your body uses glycogen stored in the muscles to provide the energy needed for exercise, and the body makes that glycogen by breaking down the carbohydrates you eat. So carbohydrates are the vital fuel needed for training, and the more training an athlete does, the more fuel they need. Sprinters will often train for just an hour a day, whereas an endurance athlete will train for three hours or more. To sustain that level of training, sprinters need to eat around 5g of carbs per kg of body weight every day, whereas endurance athletes need at least 7g per kg. For Jamaican sprint sensation Usain Bolt, that means consuming some 450g of carbs a day, whereas, while Ethiopian distance demon Haile Gebrselassie would need at least 380g. Despite doing less training, Bolt would have to eat more carbs simply because he weighs more. So what's the fuel of choice for these elite athletes? ""In general, endurance athletes are better about getting a variety of carbs, just because they have to eat so many they get bored. They're good at mixing up pasta, rice and potatoes,"" says Stear. Because ""strength-and-speed"" athletes do less training than endurance athletes, they have to watch their weight. Stear says sprinters often favor low glycemic-index carbs to help them keep their weight in check. What is the glycemic index? Carb consumption becomes crucial when athletes are training more than once a day. Stear says it's essential that athletes refuel between training sessions, otherwise they risk fatigue, which can weaken their immune system and make injury more likely. She also stresses the importance of refueling immediately after training, when the body restocks glycogen at a higher rate. When it comes to this kind of rapid refueling, athletes load up on high glycemic-index carbs, which the body can better convert to glycogen -- and then to energy. But man cannot live by bread alone. Protein is needed for building and repairing muscle and is essential in the diet of athletes and non-athletes alike. Surprisingly, the protein recommendations for elite athletes are much the same as for regular folks. A confirmed couch potato needs about 0.75g of protein per kg of body weight per day, while someone doing regular activity -- about an hour of a day -- needs some 1.2g/kg. Endurance athletes need about 1.3g/kg and strength and speed athletes, with their extra muscle volume, need about 1.5g/kg. Even once the competition has begun, nutrition has a role in keeping the body working at its best. In endurance events, from distance running to tennis, the main danger for an athlete is dehydration. ""In a marathon the runners need to refuel and rehydrate and one of the best ways of doing that is with a sports drink. They provide carbs for fuel and there's salt in there to help with electrolyte loss and help with the absorption of the water,"" says Stear. As well as eating the right food, athletes use a host of ergogenic aids to maximize performance. For example, some athletes use buffers such as sodium bicarbonate and sodium citrate to neutralize the lactic acid that builds up in the blood during exercise, fending off fatigue, while others choose to have a caffeine boost on race day. Stear says the EIS uses over 100 ergogenic aids to aid performance, as well giving athletes assorted anti-oxidants, fish oils and amino acids to boost their immune system. Diet is a serious business at the EIS, which employs 18 nutritionists. Although performance nutrition was only brought in to the set up in 2005, it has clearly had an impact on British sport. At the 2004 Olympic Games Britain won nine golds -- at the 2008 games team GB won 19. While nutrition alone cannot take the credit for that remarkable improvement, when London hosts the Olympic Games in 2012, the competitors will be all too aware the right diet could be the difference between gold and silver .","The right diet can be the difference between a gold and silver medal .

"Bangkok, Thailand (CNN) -- Thailand's prime minister huddled with the chiefs of the country's armed forces early Friday after a string of grenade attacks killed at least one person and wounded dozens of others in the already-tense capital. Prime Minister Abhisit Vejjajiva called an emergency meeting of top officials after the Thursday night attacks, which followed weeks of protests aimed at toppling his administration. Deputy Prime Minister Suthep Thaugsuban told CNN the grenades were launched from the area where the anti-government protesters, known as the Red Shirts, have been encamped for weeks, but the protesters denied any responsibility for the attacks. Suthep told Thai television earlier that three people died in the attacks, but Bangkok's Erawan Emergency and Rescue Center later revised the number to one. At least 87 people were wounded, the center said. Suthep said riot police and helicopters were deployed to join Thai troops in the area, which was still littered with glass amid the standoff. Across the barricades, the Red Shirts were playing music and trying to encourage a festive atmosphere. iReport: Are you there? Share your story, images . Demonstrators told CNN late Thursday they wanted to drive home the point that their demonstrations are supposed to be peaceful. Thursday's explosions took place near an elevated train station where the Red Shirts are gathered, said Col. Sansern Kaewkumnerd, spokesman for the Center for Resolutions under Emergency Situation. Three of the grenades landed on the roof of the station, but at least one landed outside a nearby hotel, Sansern said. The emergency center, which records patients admitted to Bangkok hospitals, said the victims suffered wounds ranging from light to some more serious injuries. Watch red shirt protests . The Red Shirts support former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, who was ousted in a bloodless military coup in 2006. They want Abhisit to dissolve the government, hold new elections and leave the country. Meanwhile, pro-government demonstrators in multicolored shirts have also mobilized to support Abhisit during the crisis. Thailand's military on Monday stationed about 1,500 troops in the area, a Bangkok financial center that houses offices for some of the nation's largest companies. The Red Shirts are occupying a large area nearby. Clashes between the two sides left about two dozen people dead and hundreds wounded on April 10. Abhisit declared a state of emergency April 7, hours after anti-government demonstrators stormed the country's parliament. He said then that the ""purpose is to restore peace and order and to stop the spreading of false information to the Thai public."" Amid the long-simmering dispute, Thailand's independent election commission recommended the dissolution of Abhisit's Democrat Party after finding it accepted an $8 million campaign donation from a private company and mishandled funds allocated to it by the commission. The ruling still must be reviewed by the country's attorney general's office and its Constitution Court, but if it stands, the 64-year-old party will be broken up, and Abhisit and its other senior leaders will be banned from politics for five years. CNN's Kocha Olarn and Arwa Damon contributed to this report.","NEW: Death toll revised downward; emergency center says at least 87 wounded .

"(CNN) -- Fourteen alleged members of the Gambino crime family have been indicted on charges including murder, racketeering, prostitution of minors and trying to locate and intimidate a sequestered jury, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of Manhattan, New York, said Tuesday. ""Today, the Gambino family has lost one of its leaders, and many of its rising stars have now fallen,"" U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara said. ""We will continue to work with our partners at the FBI to eradicate the mafia and to keep organized crime from victimizing the businesses and the people of this city."" Twelve people, including Daniel Marino, named by the U.S. attorney as the current boss of the Gambino crime family, were arrested Tuesday morning. One was arrested last week, and another was at large Tuesday afternoon, Bharara's office said. Marino has been charged with murder in various cases, including the 1989 killing of Thomas Spinelli, a member of the family who testified before a federal grand jury about the mafia's members and activities. The other defendants, who authorities say include some high-ranking members of the Gambino crime family, also have serious charges brought against them. Onofrio Modica is charged with jury tampering, which stems from 1992, when then-boss John J. Gotti was on trial on federal racketeering and murder charges. According to the U.S. attorney, Modica and other members of the Gambino family tried to locate the anonymous, sequestered jurors sitting on the trial. Modica was able to penetrate security measures and locate the hotel where the jury was sequestered, but the plan was called off after Gotti decided that the jury would not convict him, authorities allege. The U.S. attorney alleges several of the defendants also operated a prostitution business from 2008 to 2009, where young women and girls as young as 15 allegedly were recruited to be prostitutes and advertised on websites such as Craigslist. According to Bharara, the defendants drove the women to their appointments and kept approximately half the money paid to them. The women allegedly were made available for sex to gamblers at weekly high-stakes poker games that authorities say were run by the defendants. Read how rare it is for women and children to be involved . A press release from Bharara's office detailed the other charges against the defendants, including extortion; assault; trafficking of narcotics, such as cocaine, OxyContin and marijuana; wire fraud, which includes the alleged defrauding of several high-end New York restaurants by inflating invoice costs; loansharking; and gambling. ""This case shows that it's still about making money illegally, by whatever means,"" FBI Special Agent-in-Charge George Venizelos said. ""No crime seemed too depraved to be exploited if it was a money-maker, including the sexual exploitation of a 15-year-old."" According to the U.S. attorney's office, the fourteen defendants are Marino, Modica, Thomas Orefice, Dominick DiFiore, Anthony Manzella, Michael Scotto, Michael Scarpaci, Thomas Scarpaci, David Eisler, Salvatore Borgia, Steve Maiurro, Keith Dellitalia, Suzanne Porcelli and Anthony Vecchione. Maiurro remains at large. The 13 defendants all entered not guilty pleas on Tuesday, according to the U.S. attorney's office, and they are expected to appear Wednesday before a federal judge who has been appointed to the case.","Boss of Gambino crime family, other members arrested, U.S. attorney says .

"(CNN)  -- If imitation is the sincerest form of flattery, then fast food giant Burger King is paying its longtime industry rival a royal compliment. In a new television commercial, Burger King's mascot, a slightly sinister king with an outsized, motionless plastic head, breaks into the headquarters of McDonald's and steals the recipe to their Sausage McMuffin with egg and cheese. The advertisement is a parody of super agent derring-do, with high-tech gadgets and a swift getaway. But it's also a sly wink at Burger King's new BK Breakfast Muffin Sandwich's undeniable resemblance to the classic Sausage McMuffin. But are McDonald's executives upset with this campaign? Have lawyers been rallied and accusatory calls been made? ""We haven't received any direct feedback from competitors,"" said Brian Gries, Burger King's vice president of marketing impact. Gries further defends his company's choice to be up-front about the similarities between the BK Breakfast Muffin and the McMuffin, saying, ""We are not above taking a product that we know customers like and delivering it to our guests at a great price."" In fact, many others in the fast food arena aren't averse to this, either. For instance, both the BK Breakfast Muffin and the Egg McMuffin are part of special breakfast ""dollar menus."" But, as Gries points out, ""we were the first to launch a national breakfast value menu, and now you see that becoming an industry norm."" But it's a ""norm"" that is rarely acknowledged. When asked about Burger King's campaign admitting to ""stealing"" the Sausage McMuffin, a McDonald's representative said, ""We remain focused on our business and serving our business."" The proof, however, is on the record. Even if Burger King hadn't publicly admitted ""burglarizing"" McDonald's, the McMuffin arrived to market first. The original Egg McMuffin was conceived in 1972. Fortunately for competitors, McDonald's doesn't own the rights to eggs, sausage, cheese or English muffins. Just the powerful brand-name ""McMuffin."" But even ""the House That Ronald Built"" isn't above finding inspiration in the products of other fast food innovators. In 2008, McDonald's faced criticism for launching its Southern-Style Chicken Sandwich, which featured a fried chicken cutlet on a buttered bun with two pickles. To fast food connoisseurs, it appeared nearly identical to the chicken sandwich that made Georgia-based Chik-fil-A famous. These allegations were disputed by McDonald's. And this isn't the first time Burger King has created a product that mirrored its longtime rival. The Big Mac is McDonald's signature burger: two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, served on a sesame seed bun. But in 1997, Burger King released the Big King, which was two all-beef patties, special sauce, lettuce, cheese, pickles, onions, served on a sesame seed bun. The difference between the Big Mac and the Big King? It wasn't the ""special sauce,"" a variation on Thousand Island dressing. It was the beef patties: Burger King ""flame-broils,"" but McDonald's ""grill fries."" The Big King was discontinued in 2003.","Some food fights are so polite that the public may not notice .

"Washington (CNN) -- International arms dealer Viktor Bout has been indicted by federal authorities on a series of new charges, including counts of illegally purchasing U.S. cargo planes to ferry weapons to warring parties and regimes in Africa and the Middle East. The new indictment, announced in New York and Washington Wednesday, comes as the United States steps up efforts to extradite Bout to New York from Thailand, where he has been jailed since 2008. The indictment charges Bout, a Russian native, and his alleged American co-conspirator, Richard Chichakli, with the illegal purchase of a Boeing 727 and a Boeing 737 and with money laundering and wire fraud. Chichakli remains at large, authorities said. The Justice Department said Bout has been an international weapons trafficker since the 1990s, carrying out a massive weapons trafficking business by assembling a fleet of cargo planes to transport weapons to parts of Africa, the Middle East and South America. ""The arms that Bout has sold or brokered have fueled conflicts and supported regimes in Afghanistan, Angola, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Liberia, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Sudan,"" the Justice Department said. Bout ""allegedly made a career of arming bloody conflicts and supporting rogue regimes across multiple continents, even using the U.S. banking system to secretly finance a private fleet of aircraft,"" said U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara. The superseding indictments were returned by a grand jury in the Southern District of New York. The previous indictment of Bout centered on his alleged efforts to send millions of dollars worth of weapons to arm guerrilla fighters in Colombia. Thai courts to date have balked at extraditing Bout to the United States on the basis of the original charges. ""The United States has apprised Thai authorities of the new charges against Bout ... and will continue to work closely with them on this matter,"" the Justice Department statement said. ""The United States is also coordinating with Interpol to locate and arrest Chichakli.""

"(CNN) -- China's figure skating pair of Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo capped an emotional comeback to the Winter Olympics on Monday by capturing the pairs figure skating gold. By winning the event, Shen and Zhao captured their country's first gold medal in figure skating and fulfilled a quest that had previously eluded them. The husband-and-wife team had retired from Olympic competition, but was coaxed back by the hope of claiming gold. China made it a 1-2 finish in pairs skating after Pan Qing and Tong Jian claimed silver, according to the Vancouver Olympics Web site. Germany's Aliona Savchenko and Robin Szolkowy claimed third place and the bronze medal in the event. Elsewhere at the Olympics, South Korea's Mo Tae-Bum captured the gold medal in the men's 500-meter speed skating event. Japan's Keiichiro Nagashima and Joji Kato captured silver and bronze, respectively. In figure skating, China's Shen and Zhao had retired in 2007 after capturing three world championships and two Olympic bronze medalists, making them the most decorated figure skaters in their country's history. Shen and Zhao were also newlyweds after Zhao proposed to Shen on the ice following a stunning 2007 World Championship performance in Tokyo. Headlining the popular Stars on Ice tour in the United States, retirement seemed like a natural step for Zhao and Shen. But after just two years away, they declared they would return for the Vancouver Olympics, presumably to capture the gold medal that eluded them. CNN memories: What was it like to train with Olympic champs? Zhao and Shen kicked off their comeback fittingly by winning the Cup of China last season. They won all three of their events and set a new world record at the Grand Prix Final. The pair, formerly ranked number one in the world, opened the Vancouver Olympic figure skating competitions by performing first of the 20 competing pairs. Their draw was considered bad luck, especially because Shen and Zhao currently rank 29th in the world after being away from competition. Zhao and Shen delivered a near flawless performance in the short program on Sunday, what many skating analysts called their strongest program ever. ""We wanted the program to show all that we have, and we made it,"" Zhao told the Xinhua news agency in Vancouver following the short program on Sunday. ""It's the best gift for the Valentine's Day,"" Shen added. CNN's Jo Ling Kent contributed to this report.","China's Shen Xue and Zhao Hongbo claim figure skating pairs gold .

""I've done a lot of things in this sport, things that a lot of fighters weren't able to do in the sport and didn't do in the sport. This fight with Shane Mosley will enhance my legacy."" Mayweather, 33, has won all 40 of his professional bouts and is a six-time world champion at five different weights. His proposed ""super fight"" with WBO welterweight champ Manny Pacquiao broke down after a disagreement over drug testing procedures, and he opted to fight Mosely instead. Mayweather referred to his opponent as ""a solid welterweight with great accomplishments,"" but dismissed his chances of a victory at the MGM Grand. ""We are totally different,"" he added. ""He's a fighter that always worries about landing one big shot, he worries about who is extremely strong. ""And I worry about being smart and winning. We approach fights in two totally different ways. When I shoot my shots, I am looking at my opponent. When Shane punches, a lot of times he closes his eyes. ""I am pretty sure Shane is going to be in good condition. We are going to put on one hell of a show on May 1 come the fight. Like I have always said before - there is no remedy on how to beat Floyd Mayweather. Everyone is trying to solve the problem. ""It's like a difficult maths problem that no one can solve. No one can solve it. The ultimate goal is try to solve the problem. How to beat Floyd Mayweather? I know what I have to go out there and do.""","Floyd Mayweather's fight with Shane Mosley will not be for the World Boxing Association title .

"Mountain View, California (CNN) -- At this moment we have reached a major turning point for both science and the public at large. The SETI Institute is now offering the world the first taste of raw SETI (Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence) data collected by the Allen Telescope Array in California. With this we move closer to fulfilling the institute's mission, which is to search for our beginnings and our place among the stars . Throughout the institute's 25-year history (we are a private, nonprofit organization dedicated to scientific research, education and public outreach), we have analyzed these raw data with custom algorithms operating on semi-custom hardware. Now we are transitioning to readily available hardware and servers because technology has caught up to us -- hooray! In the future, we hope that a global army of open-source code developers, students and other experts in digital signal processing, as well as citizen scientists willing to lend their intelligence to our exploration, will have access to the same technology and join our quest. As I look at my team at the SETI Institute in Mountain View, and at a handful of other SETI teams around the globe, I see very clever individuals who have been willing to forgo the traditional challenges and rewards of academic research to work on a program of immense potential -- to do work that can literally change the world. Many see SETI as a fascinating avocation, but few indeed are willing to make it their vocation. Read more about Jill Tarter at TED.com . In 2009, when TED awarded me its TED prize and the opportunity to make a wish to change the world - -a wish they would help me fulfil l -- I thought of a mirror. It is the mirror that we hold up to the planet in our scientific search for the answer to the ancient question, 'Are we alone?' It is the mirror in which all humans can see themselves as the same, when compared to the extraterrestrial other. It's the mirror that allows us to alter our daily perspectives and see ourselves in a more cosmic setting. It is the mirror that reminds us of our common origins in stardust. TED and technology are helping me and my team hold up that mirror to all inhabitants of this planet so that we can see our reflection as Earthlings. I told TED that ""I wish that you would empower Earthlings everywhere to become active participants in the ultimate search for cosmic company."" Soon it will be time for you to get involved by participating at setiQuest.org, a website that will make available the results that we get from our telescopes. Right now the site is geared to those knowledgable about digital signal processing, but in the coming months, anyone -- from a child playing a setiQuest game to an interested adult -- can join the search for intelligent life in the cosmos. It's been 50 years since Philip Morrison and Guiseppe Cocconi published their seminal scientific paper on SETI in the journal Nature, and since Frank Drake first used the Tatel telescope in Green Bank, West Virginia, to attempt to detect any radio signals from technologies he thought could be orbiting the nearby stars of Tau Ceti and Epsilon Eridani. Since then, only those of us privileged enough to use the marvelous tools of the astronomer have been able to shape this pursuit of cosmic company. For the past decade, you and any other person around the globe have been able to leave your computer turned on and search through data recorded at large radio telescopes with the SETI@home screen saver. But you couldn't change or improve the search your computer was enabling, you couldn't get involved creatively. You didn't have to see your reflection in the cosmic mirror. Now that computing has gotten fast enough, now that Amazon Web Services, Dell, Intel, Google and others have donated resources to the SETI Institute, my team and I can benefit from your skills and your energy. You can help us with our search. Access the raw data we have published at setiQuest and show us how to process it in new ways, find signals that our current signal detection algorithms are missing. This summer, when we openly publish our software detection code, you can take what you find useful for your own work, and then help us make it better for our SETI search. As I wished, I'd like to get all Earthlings spending a bit of their day looking at data from the Allen Telescope Array to see if they can find patterns that all of the signal detection algorithms may still be missing, and while they are doing that, get them thinking about their place in the cosmos. That's the way we can change the world! We don't yet know how to get our data out of the observatory and presented to willing citizen scientists in real-time -- but if you are technically savvy, that's where you come in, that's where you can help us make the search better. The SETI Institute can begin to count anyone in the world as a member of our team. All of the SETI searching over the past 50 years is equivalent to examining one 8-ounce glass of water from the Earth's oceans -- a lot of human effort, but not a lot of exploration. As our technologies improve exponentially, and as the world joins our searches, we may finally have the right tools for exploring the cosmic ocean. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jill Tarter .","Jill Tarter says the SETI Institute is offering the world raw cosmic data from its telescopes .
She said technology has enabled nonscientists to help search for extraterrestrial life .
When the setiQuest site is fully developed, even kids will be able to search data .

"(CNN) -- Mexican authorities on Thursday continued to investigate the kidnappings of at least six people from a Holiday Inn in Monterrey, Mexico, Wednesday. Nuevo Leon state Attorney General Alejandro Garza y Garza said in a news conference that the unidentified gunmen entered a second hotel as well, the state-run Notimex news agency reported. A convoy of between 10 and 15 vehicles carrying as many as 30 gunmen pulled into the Holiday Inn at around 2 a.m., Garza y Garza said. According to him, the gunmen brought a handcuffed man into the lobby, who gave them information on the intended victims. A businessman from Mexico City, Luis Miguel Gonzalez, was kidnapped, along with three other guests, Garza y Garza said. The other guests were identified as Angel Ernesto Montes de Oca of Mexico City, Manuel Juarez and Aracely Hernandez, an employee of a staffing company near the border with the United States. A hotel receptionist, David Salas, was also kidnapped, together with another hotel employee, authorities said. A security guard at the hotel was missing, but it was not confirmed that he too was kidnapped, Garza y Garza said. Before leaving, the gunmen took the computer from the reception desk as well as the video from the security camera, he said. Minutes later, there was a report of the same group of gunmen entering the Mision Hotel, located near the Holiday Inn. Police responded to the hotel, but the officials there declined to report a crime to the authorities. Northern Mexico, particularly the states of Tamaulipas and Nuevo Leon, have seen a recent uptick in violent activity, much of it blamed on warring drug cartels.","About 30 gunmen stormed into the Holiday Inn at around 2 a.m.

"(CNN) -- Barcelona will be without influential midfielder Andres Iniesta for most of the decisive run-in to the end of this season as the Catalan side seek to retain their Spanish and European titles. Iniesta had only just returned to Josep Guardiola's team last week as a substitute for the second leg of the Champions League quarterfinal against Arsenal, and then also came on in the 2-0 win at Real Madrid, but has suffered another injury blow in training after tearing a calf muscle. The 25-year-old Spain international could be out for up to a month, Barcelona's Web site reported on Tuesday, meaning he may not be fit to return until the club's final domestic league match against Real Valladolid on May 16. ""Andres Iniesta suffered the injury during training and doctors have diagnosed a total rupture of the right femoral biceps muscle,"" the club's Web site said. Iniesta is set to miss the Champions League semifinals against Italian champions Inter Milan on April 20 and 28, but may return for the final on May 22 in Madrid if Barca progress that far. Barcelona lead Real by three points with seven matches to play ahead of Wednesday's home clash with Deportivo La Coruna, while their title rivals travel to Almeria on Thursday. Barca will again be without injured striker Zlatan Ibrahimovic, but the Sweden international is expected to return to training before Saturday's local derby at Espanyol, the club's Web site reported. Meanwhile, Sevilla's hopes of qualifying for next season's Champions League suffered another blow with a 2-1 defeat at relegation-threatened Valladolid on Tuesday night. Sevilla stayed in fourth place on goal difference from Mallorca, who travel to struggling Zaragoza on Wednesday. Valladolid remained second from bottom despite giving former Spain coach Javier Clemente victory in his first home match. Clemente has earned four points from two games since taking over as Diego Costa headed the opening goal four minutes before halftime and fellow striker Manucho scored the second eight minutes after the break. Juan Cala pulled one back from long range with seven minutes left, but Sevilla fell to a ninth defeat from 16 away games this season. Getafe claimed seventh place from fellow Europa League Villarreal with a 3-0 victory in Tuesday's late match. On-loan striker Miku netted twice, scoring either side of a free-kick from Mane as all three goals came in the second half. Goalkeeper Diego Lopez gifted Miku the 56th-minute opener, and he pushed Mane's 25-yard strike onto the post and slowly over the line with 18 minutes left. Tenerife stayed in the third relegation place, one point above Valladolid, despite registering a first away win this season, 2-0 at mid-table Sporting Gijon. Roman Martinez and Alejandro Alfaro scored in the final 20 minutes to put the islanders just two points behind Malaga, who travel to Osasuna on Wednesday.","Barcelona midfielder Andres Iniesta ruled out for up to a month with a calf injury .

"(CNN) -- A man suspected of opening fire at a Tennessee hospital Monday, killing one and wounding another before killing himself, had a history of mental health problems, police said Tuesday. Investigators searching suspected shooter Abdo Ibssa's home found medicine for psychotic problems and a note indicating that Ibssa believed a doctor at the hospital had placed an electronic chip inside him during a 2001 appendectomy, Knoxville Police Chief Sterling Owen IV told reporters Tuesday. ""The suspect believed he was being tracked due to this chip,"" Owen said. Owen said family members had committed Ibssa to a mental health facility in February, but it was not clear when he had been discharged. Police said Ibssa shot three women outside the Parkwest Medical Center in Knoxville, Tennessee, Monday afternoon before shooting and killing himself. Rachel Wattenbarger, 40, died from gunshot wounds. The two survivors -- Ariane Guerin, 26, and Nancy Chancellor, 32 -- were taken to the trauma center at the University of Tennessee hospital. Owen said Tuesday that they were in stable condition. When Ibssa showed up at the hospital Monday afternoon, he asked for the doctor who had apparently performed his appendectomy. He was told the doctor was not there, Owen said, and later opened fire outside the facility. Owen said the .357 Magnum revolver used by the shooter was reported stolen from a residence in Knox County, Tennessee, in March. Police searching Ibbsa's home also found a Beretta .22 handgun and a book called ""The Official CIA Manual of Tracking and Deception,"" Owen said.","Medicine for psychotic problems found at Abdo Ibssa's home .

"(CNN) -- Nearly 2,000 miles from Haiti, there's a ripple effect from the earthquake that devastated the country on January 12. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have arrested 140 Haitian men and women who have crossed the border from Canada into Vermont since late January. Many had gone to Canada well before the earthquake to seek asylum, and thought they could take advantage of a relaxed U.S. policy on deporting Haitians. ""One of the things that's happening is that some of these individuals that have previously been either deported or ordered deported and are looking for refuge in Canada, have entered Canada illegally, are now looking to come back into the U.S. and possibly take advantage of the temporary protected status that our government has given,"" said David Aguilar, acting deputy commissioner at U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That temporary protected status allows Haitians who were in the United States at the time of the earthquake to stay longer, regardless of whether they were in the country legally or not. But the policy does not protect Haitians illegally entering the country now. ""We are going to apprehend them,"" said Aguilar. ""These are people that should not have come into this country and applied for a program that they do not benefit from."" That message was likely lost in translation,  said David Watts, a court-appointed attorney for three Haitians charged with illegal entry and jailed. ""I think there's no doubt that there was some confusion,"" Watts said. ""None of them have immigration lawyers, they're relying on the word on the street and the word in the community."" One of the men Watts represents is Arry Seguin, whose story is not uncommon. Seguin was living in the Haitian community in Montreal after going to Canada in 2008 to seek asylum. Until then, he had been living in Florida with his wife and two children, now ages 6 and 2. Seguin left the United States after losing appeals to stay. His wife, Louizette, a naturalized citizen, lives in a cramped apartment in Lantana, Florida, and doesn't understand why her husband can't join her. ""You see, everything is a mess without him. Nothing is working well without him,"" she says. She says she struggles to take care of her children, but she is also getting calls from relatives in Haiti who are desperate for help. It's the reason she believes her husband tried to return to Florida. He never made it far beyond the Canadian-Vermont border and was arrested in the early morning hours of March 21. Because Seguin doesn't have a criminal record, his lawyer was able to reach a settlement with prosecutors. For now, Seguin will be eligible to stay in the United States under supervised release, checking in with immigration authorities. It will be up to a judge to decide if that happens. Watts expects his client will released from jail soon. While Seguin will eventually face deportation, Watts says the goal is to return him to his family to weather their immediate personal crisis. ""So he will have achieved his goal, but for the fact that he's spent an awful lot of time in jail,"" Watts said. ""It would have been better, given what actually happened, if he had been able to come back and help sooner."" Taking the risk of getting caught was in the cards, says Chrissy Etienne, who works as an interpreter for the Haitian men and women who've been arrested. Etienne is a Haitian native living in Burlington, Vermont, having recently graduated from Middlebury College. Because she speaks Creole, she had signed up to be a translator and was stunned when attorneys called in February asking for help. Since then, her phone hasn't stopped ringing and she's met with dozens of Haitians who've been arrested, meeting them either in prison or in court. ""I think some thought there is a great chance I will get caught,"" says Etienne. ""I think some expected to get caught. I think it was get to the U.S. at all costs, get to my family at all costs."" ""I think that it is connected to the earthquake,"" says Etienne. ""When you lose your home, when you lose Haiti as a whole. What is left?"" Giving a voice to the arrested Haitians, she said, has been tough since she is restrained in what she can do. Etienne describes a common scenario with the men and women she deals with, saying, ""There is that, that wish for a system that is more personal. Couldn't I just explain this to a judge? To someone? That I am not a criminal. That I have no background or criminal background. I am just trying to get to my family. Isn't there someone who is going to believe that story? And who is going to hear me? ""And there is that moment where ... I know what the attorney is going to say and I have to relate it with that same sort of calm, collected feeling, but I am also watching someone fall apart.""","140 Haitians have crossed the U.S.-Canada border since the Haiti earthquake .

"(CNN) -- Barack Obama has come in at eighth in a list of golf-playing American presidents, higher than both George Bush and Ronald Reagan.

In fact, president Obama played a round as recently as last Sunday, when his flight to Poland for the funeral of president Lech Kaczynski was cancelled due to the volcanic ash cloud over Europe. Golf Digest magazine has ranked president Obama ahead of both Bush and Reagan, but behind Bill Clinton -- who was known to practise his putting in the aisle of Air Force One.","Barack Obama has come in at eighth in a list of golf-playing American presidents .

"Tehran, Iran (CNN) -- Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad warned the United States and other nations Tuesday not to impose tougher sanctions in reaction to the Islamic country's nuclear ambitions. Iran already faces U.N. sanctions and the five permanent Security Council members -- the United States, Britain, Russia, China and France, all of which have veto power -- have been engaged along with Germany in discussions about possible further measures. ""It's high time for some people to open their eyes and adapt themselves to real changes that are under way,"" Ahmadinejad said at a news conference in Tehran. Asked specifically about the threat of tougher sanctions, the Iranian president said, ""We prefer that they move in the spirit of cooperation. It won't put us in trouble. They themselves will get into trouble."" Ahmadinejad also seemed to threaten unspecified retaliation, saying Iran won't act like it has in the past. ""Definitely, we will show a reaction that will put them to shame, like always,"" he said. Ahmadinejad's comments came one day after U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Saudi Arabian Foreign Minister Saud al-Faisal expressed concern over Iran's nuclear program. Meeting in Riyadh with al-Faisal during a four-day trip to the Middle East, Clinton called Iran's recent announcement that it has started to produce higher-grade enriched uranium ""a provocative move in defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions."" Clinton further warned that the ""increasingly disturbing and destabilizing actions"" by Iran ""will result in increasing isolation."" Earlier Monday, Clinton told a town hall meeting in Doha, Qatar, that the United States believes Iran ""is moving toward a military dictatorship."" Clinton was responding to a question about whether the United States was preparing for military action in Iran. ""No, we are planning to bring the world community together in applying pressure to Iran through sanctions adopted by the United Nations that will be particularly aimed at those enterprises controlled by the Revolutionary Guard, which we believe is, in effect, supplanting the government of Iran,"" Clinton said. She added, ""We see that the government of Iran, the supreme leader, the president, the parliament, is being supplanted, and that Iran is moving toward a military dictatorship. Now, that is our view."" Clinton called for stronger actions after Iran announced it is stepping up production of highly enriched uranium. ""Iran leaves the international community little choice but to impose greater costs for its provocative steps,"" Clinton said. ""Together, we are encouraging Iran to reconsider its dangerous policy decisions."" Speaking at the U.S.-Islamic World Forum, Clinton said the United States is ""working actively"" with its partners ""to prepare and implement new measures to convince Iran to change its course."" Ahmadinejad said at a Monday news conference that Iran had no choice but to enrich the uranium because the International Atomic Energy Agency did not fulfill its obligation to provide the Islamic republic with the nuclear material. Iran said last week that it had completed its first batch of 20 percent enriched uranium and will soon triple production. Uranium enriched to 20 percent can set off a nuclear reaction, scientists say, but is not weapons grade. Answering a question from CNN, Ahmadinejad said it was not economical for Iran to perform its own enrichment. The Islamic republic would rather buy it from other sources, he said. But the nation's supply of enriched uranium was running low and Iran could not afford to wait any longer, Ahmadinejad said. He would not confirm or deny that Iran would be willing to stop its enrichment program if it could obtain the uranium elsewhere. Iranian enrichment of uranium at 20 percent is ""wholly unjustified,"" three diplomats wrote the U.N. nuclear agency's director-general in a letter obtained Tuesday by CNN. The U.S., French and Russia ambassadors to the IAEA said the move is ""contrary to U.N. Security Council resolutions"" and poses ""a further step toward a capability to produce high enriched uranium."" Such an enrichment, the three said in a letter dated February 12, ""is not only unnecessary, but would serve to further undermine the confidence of the international community in Iran's actions."" On Monday, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State P.J. Crowley talked about the joint letter to IAEA director General Yukiya Amano. ""We referred back to the Tehran research reactor proposal from last fall that Iran has yet to accept and we alluded to the availability of medical isotopes on the international market,"" Crowley said. ""Given these two legitimate and immediately available options, there is no rationale for Iran to attempt to produce its own fuel."" Asked about comments made Monday by the director of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, Ali Akbar Salehi, to the semi-official Fars News Agency that Iran would be prepared to stop its 20 percent enrichment, Crowley encouraged Iran to put forth its proposals. ""If they have ideas on how to enact the Tehran research reactor proposal, they should bring them to the IAEA and we can have another round of talks,"" Crowley said. ""Within the parameters of the Tehran research reactor proposal, we are happy to discuss effective ways of implementing it. Our problem is that we had one meeting on the issue and Iran has yet to come back to the table."" Iran insists its nuclear program is solely for peaceful civilian purposes. Clinton said she's not so sure. ""Iran has consistently failed to live up to its responsibilities,"" she said. ""It has refused to demonstrate to the international community that its nuclear program is entirely peaceful. And last year, the world learned of a secret nuclear facility near the city of Qom."" Iran could obtain the enriched uranium it says it wants for medical research by accepting a proposal under which Iran would ship its uranium abroad to be enriched and then returned, but Iran has rejected that offer, Clinton said. ""This has only deepened the international community's doubts about Iran's nuclear intentions, along with the Iranian government's own isolation."" She added that Iran has also refused recent diplomatic efforts to reach a resolution. A soon-to-be released U.S. assessment of Iran's nuclear program is expected to conclude the government has resumed limited work on a nuclear weapon, according to a U.S. official. CNN's Shirzad Bozorgmehr and Elise Labott contributed to this report.","Ahmadinejad warns U.N. Security Council against imposing tougher sanctions .

"(CNN) -- If you've been to the movies recently, you've probably been pummeled with trailers for interchangeable all-star action movies: ""The Expendables,"" ""The A-Team"" and ""The Losers."" Mercenaries are in this year, and khaki is the new black. ""The Losers"" is first out of the blocks, and it's a cheerfully vulgar shoot-'em-up that doesn't have a serious bone in its pumped-up body. Based on Andy Diggle's Vertigo comic book (itself loosely inspired by the old DC comic), the movie doesn't really flow; it just spurts out in quick, oily jets. It's actually less like a comic book and more like a 90-minute trailer: all the best bits stuck end to end and the filler condensed into a pithy line or (better yet) a clubby music cue. (The Kills' ""U R A Fever"" comes up twice -- once for a fight scene and then again for a sex scene -- but there's no doubt the fight is the turn-on, and it lasts much longer, too.) If you've seen the trailer, you'll feel you're halfway there, and if you caught co-writer Peter Berg in ""Smokin' Aces"" a couple of years back, you'll know what else is in store. The Losers are some kind of CIA black ops squad, but only for a nanosecond. There are five of them, each with his own wardrobe fetish and each with a prescribed skill set: Clay is the leader (Jeffrey Dean Morgan from ""Watchmen""), and he looks good with one shirt-tail hanging out. Jensen (Chris Evans) is tech support and comic relief in a series of nasty T-shirts. Cougar (Oscar Jaenada) is a sniper and never separated from his cowboy hat. Pooch (Columbus Short) is the driver and family man. Roque (Idris Elba, aka Stringer Bell from ""The Wire"") is second-in-command, a knife expert with a scar down his cheek. They're a bit lightweight in star power -- Evans is the biggest draw and the most fun -- and they're not so badass that they're willing to take out a Bolivian crime boss when they realize he's surrounded himself with children. In rescuing the kids, the Losers seal their own death warrant with their controller, Max, a super-patriot whose precise role in U.S. intelligence is shrouded in secrecy but who has been written as a cross between Dick Cheney and Dr. No (though Jason Patric, who plays him, resembles a psychotically soft-spoken Warren Beatty). Left for dead in the jungle, the team is rescued, sort of, by a high-kicking beanpole with an open credit line. This is Aisha (Zoe Saldana), and she hires the Losers to bring down Max. ""How do I know I can trust you?"" Clay wants to know. ""Because if I was lying, I wouldn't have used the words 'suicide mission,' "" she very reasonably points out. Locked into the faddish slam-cut video game look and filtered (perhaps in deference to a string of Central American locations) in malarial shades of green and yellow, ""The Losers"" wants to seem cutting edge, though it clings to a quaint Saturday morning serial black-and-white morality. Max isn't just down on kids, he plans to get his paws on ""next-generation"" weapons, kick-start a war or two, destabilize the developing world and put the U.S. back on top. Laughable! Directed by Sylvain White (""Stomp the Yard""), the movie musters a modicum of snap, crackle and pop, but the whole shooting match is delivered in such an assiduously shorthand style that when the smoke clears, it's hard not to feel a teensy bit short-changed.","""The Losers"" is based on Andy Diggle's Vertigo comic book .

"(CNN) -- FA Cup finalists Portsmouth will not be allowed to play in next season's Europa League, the English Football Association (FA) have confirmed. The financially-stricken side, who became the first-ever Premier League club to enter administration earlier this year, would have been gauranteed a place in Europe next season because their final opponents, Chelsea, have secured a Champions League place. However, Portsmouth's administrators -- who revealed on Wednesday that the club is in debt to the tune of $170m -- have been told that any late application for a UEFA club licence will not be considered due to the club's on-going financial problems. A joint statement from the FA and English Premier League said: ""The FA and Premier League have confirmed to the administrators of Portsmouth that they shall not consider any late application for granting of a UEFA Club Licence for the 2010-11 season."" The decision means the team who finish seventh in the Premier League, with Liverpool currently in that position, will take Portsmouth's place. European football's governing body UEFA had earlier revealed that the club could submit a late application before May 31 -- but the Premier League and FA have subsequently decreed that the Portsmouth's financial situation is so bad that they would not meet any of UEFA's criteria to enter. Portsmouth's administrator Andrew Andronikou told Press Association Sport: ""We have spent a long time going through all the necessary steps and we had hoped to make a European application next week. ""We felt that we would do our bit and that it would be up to the FA and the Premier League to do theirs. It's wrong for the fans that they should not be allowed to support their club in Europe next season.""","FA Cup finalists Portsmouth will not be allowed to play in next season's Europa League .

"Rome, Italy (CNN) -- The Vatican said a lawsuit accusing it and Pope Benedict XVI of covering up sexual abuse by a priest at a Catholic school in the United States has no merit. ""While legitimate lawsuits have been filed by abuse victims, this is not one of them,"" Vatican lawyer Jeffrey Lena said Friday. ""Instead, the lawsuit represents an attempt to use tragic events as a platform for a broader attack."" The lawsuit by an unnamed Illinois man demands the Vatican release the names of thousands of Catholic priests that the suit says have ""credible allegations of sexual misconduct"" against them. The alleged victim, who is now an adult, says he was molested by the Rev. Lawrence Murphy while a student at St. John's School for the Deaf, according to the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. ""The defendant, [the] Holy See, has known about the widespread problem of childhood sexual abuse committed by its clergy for centuries, but has covered up that abuse and thereby perpetuated the abuse,"" the suit says. ""The case against the Holy See and its officials is completely without merit,"" Lena said. ""Most of the complaint rehashes old theories already rejected by U.S. courts."" Lena added, ""With regard to Murphy himself, the Holy See and its officials knew nothing of his crimes until decades after the abuse occurred, and had no role whatsoever in causing plaintiff's injuries."" Benedict was named as a defendant because he has the ultimate authority to remove priests and because of his involvement in reviewing sex abuse cases when he was Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the suit says. Peter Isely, Midwest director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, estimated the Vatican is investigating 4,000 cases of sex abuse by church employees. The lawsuit aims to change church policies and practices that conceal sex offenders, Isely said. ""It's going to protect children, we hope, around the world,"" he said, ""This is a historic day and hopefully this is going to result in historic changes."" Arthur Budzinski, a deaf man who said he was sexually assaulted and raped by Murphy, stood with Isely at a news conference Thursday. He said the priest ""may have stolen our bodies,"" but higher clerics such as cardinals, archbishops and the pope ""stole our voices."" Budzinski, who is not a party to the lawsuit, made his comments in sign language and his daughter, Gigi, interpreted his words. Murphy, who died in 1998, is believed to have molested up to 200 boys, Isely said. The lawsuit said the church ""knew that there was a high probability that these clerics would sexually molest more children, but sought to protect itself from scandal, sought to keep its income stream going, at the peril of children.""

"RICHMOND, Virginia (CNN) -- Maria Stephens barely flinches when her three rambunctious young sons strike up a baseball game in her living room. ""I thought you boys were going to play in the front yard,"" she laughs while Christian, 2, swings a black plastic bat near the kitchen table. Maria Stephens went from making $80,000 a year to being homeless with three boys to care for. It's hard to imagine all that energy cooped up in the small room where Stephens and her children spent seven months last year -- in a homeless shelter. Stephens, a mortgage underwriter who made $80,000 a year, faced a reversal of fortune so swift and devastating she still can't quite fathom it. The single mom went from paying $1,900 a month in rent to bunking at the shelter, an unexpected victim in the foreclosure crisis. And she is not alone. While the foreclosure rate across the country has grown dramatically in recent months, often lost in the statistics are numbers of Americans made homeless through no fault of theirs -- renters. About 40 percent of people facing eviction from foreclosure in the United States are renters, according to the National Low Income Housing Coalition [NLIHC]. Yet regulations on the rental industry vary by state, and often there are no protections for those living in rental properties. For Stephens, the ordeal started with bad news from her landlord. ""My landlord came and told me that his property was being foreclosed on,"" Stephens said. She moved her children, one then a newborn and the other two under 7, to a cheaper rental but had to leave there, too, when she lost her job and then her new landlord decided to sell the property.  Watch more about the ordeals of some renters » . ""I had to hold back my tears because I'm like, oh my goodness. I'm from a middle-class family. ... I've had the best of everything,"" said Stephens. ""I've never been in a situation where I didn't have a place to live. I made the money."" While Stephens' situation was worsened by the loss of her income, advocates with organizations such as NLIHC say many times evictions hit renters who are working and financially up-to-date. ""People who had been paying their rent on time, had been keeping up with their lease requirements, all of a sudden are served with foreclosure notices,"" said NLIHC Deputy Director Linda Couch. ""And in every state but New Jersey and the District of Columbia, renters are not allowed to stay through their lease term and are given no special protections."" The problem is exacerbated for low-income renters, who may struggle to find affordable housing on short notice. The director of SERVE, a homeless advocacy group in Manassas, Virginia, has seen an explosion of renters in need of shelter over the past seven months. Officials at another Virginia shelter have braced for an influx of families they believe will start seeking services soon. Some offer emergency shelter for families who might get only a few days' notice before being forced to move out. Last year, an Illinois sheriff temporarily refused to evict renters, some of whom learned about the foreclosure when sheriff's deputies showed up at their door. Bill Apgar, senior adviser for mortgage finance at the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, said the Obama administration is working to solve the problem. The president's 2010 budget proposal includes $1 billion for a National Housing Trust Fund, which would go towards building and preserving low-income housing. There is also a boost in funding to a voucher program that keeps families in their homes. NLIHC's Couch applauded these efforts but urged the federal government to go further. She wants to compel banks and owners who take over foreclosed property to allow renters to stay through their lease. Mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac already give renters that protection. ""We do think that solutions as simple as those requirements could have an immediate and dramatic impact on potentially millions of peoples' lives,"" Couch said. For Stephens, who now has a new job and is renting again, the experience has caused her to leave as little as possible to chance -- she saves enough to give her family a cushion, just in case. And she emphasizes to her children an outlook on life now vital for renters as well as for homeowners. ""No matter where we laid our heads,"" Stephens said, ""I told my sons as long as we're together, we'll be OK.""","About 40% of people facing eviction from foreclosure are renters, coalition finds .

"Washington (CNN) -- Nearly 180 Department of Homeland Security weapons were lost -- some falling into the hands of criminals -- after officers left them in restrooms, vehicles and other public places, according to an inspector general report. The officers, with Customs and Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement, ""did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms and, as a result, lost a significant number of firearms"" between fiscal year 2006 and fiscal year 2008, the report said. In all, 243 firearms were lost in both agencies during that period, according to the January report from Inspector General Richard Skinner. Of those, 36 were lost because of circumstances beyond officers' control -- for instance, ICE lost a firearm during an assault on an officer. Another 28 were lost even though officers had stored them in lockboxes or safes. But 74 percent, or 179 guns, were lost ""because officers did not properly secure them,"" the report said. Following a review of the draft report in December, Homeland Security took steps to implement its recommendations and overhaul its property management policy, according to a response in the report. A department spokeswoman did not immediately return a call from CNN Thursday seeking comment. The report concluded the department did not have specific procedures and policies in place regarding firearms. ""Instead, DHS relied on its components to augment its general property management policies and procedures with specific guidance for safeguarding and controlling firearms,"" it said. ""Although some component policies and procedures for safeguarding firearms were sufficient, personnel did not always follow them."" The inspector general cited several examples of ""inappropriate practices."" A customs officer, for instance, left a firearm in an idling vehicle in the parking lot of a convenience store. The vehicle was stolen while the officer was inside. ""A local law enforcement officer later recovered the firearm from a suspected gang member and drug smuggler,"" the report said. In addition, an ICE officer left an M-4 rifle and a shotgun unsecured in a closet at his home. Both weapons were stolen in a burglary and later recovered from a felon, according to the report. Another officer left his firearm in the restroom of a fast-food restaurant, and it was gone when he returned. ""Other CBP and ICE officers left firearms in places such as a fast food restaurant parking lot, a bowling alley and a clothing store,"" the report said. ""Although our review focused on CBP and ICE, other components described similar incidents. For example, a TSA officer left a firearm in a lunch box on the front seat of an unlocked vehicle; the officer realized the firearm was stolen when he returned to the vehicle two days later,"" said the report. ""Officers may have prevented many of these losses had they exercised reasonable care when storing their weapons."" Of the 179 lost because of laxity, 120 were reported stolen and 59 as lost, the report said. That resulted from the agencies' lack of guidance on a standard method for classifying and reporting lost firearms, as well as ""a common perception among officers that reporting a stolen firearm was more acceptable than reporting a lost firearm. ""Although CBP and ICE reported 120 firearms as stolen, our analysis showed that these firearms were lost (stolen) because officers left the firearms unsecured,"" according to the report. ""All 179 losses may have been prevented had the officers properly secured their firearms."" The department had about 188,500 weapons in its inventory as of last summer, the report said. The majority are assigned to Customs and Border Protection and ICE officers, but others are carried by agencies including the U.S. Coast Guard, the U.S. Secret Service and the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center.","Customs, ICE officers ""did not always sufficiently safeguard their firearms,"" report says .

"(CNN) -- A 17-year-old boy was among the seven people killed in a noon shootout Friday on the streets of Ciudad Juarez, Mexico, police said Saturday. The other victims were police officers, Mayor Jose Reyes Ferriz said Friday. Five were federal police officers and one was a female city police officer, all part of the joint police task force formed to combat drug violence in the border town. Another federal officer was gravely wounded, Reyes said, and a city officer was wounded but not with life-threatening injuries. A civilian was hit by shrapnel, but those injuries were also not serious, he said. Reyes said the incident began when two patrol cars, one from federal police and one from city police, stopped several people they had been investigating. Gunmen in at least two vehicles attacked the police convoy with weapons including AK-47s, he said. The federal police said the gunmen, who escaped in a gray Dodge Durango and a green Dodge Caravan, may have been drug dealers and that the attack may have been in response to several recent arrests in Juarez, including that of eight people apprehended Thursday for possession of weapons, drugs and a stolen van. The mayor said it wasn't immediately clear why the police had stopped the people or whether the incident was drug related. Investigators are treating the incident ""as a direct attack on police officers,"" he said. Federal police launched an aerial search for the gunmen's vehicles, but there have been no arrests. Reyes said at a meeting with federal police that he was ordering an increase of patrol cars so there will be three or four cars per location. About 800 police cars now patrol the city, Reyes said. The city police force consists of 3,000 officers, bolstered by 5,000 federal officers. Ciudad Juarez is the most violent city in the nation, with more than 2,600 drug-related deaths in 2009. No official numbers are available, but more than 400 killings have been reported by local media this year. The city, long the focal point of President Felipe Calderon's battle against drug cartels, came to renewed prominence after the January 31 killings of 15 people, most of them students with no links to organized crime. The massacre sparked outrage throughout Mexico and drew worldwide attention. In another incident that drew widespread attention, three people associated with the U.S. Consulate in Juarez were gunned down in two shootings last month. Two of the victims, including a pregnant woman, were U.S. citizens living in El Paso, Texas. CNN's Esprit Smith contributed to this report.","NEW: Gunmen may be drug dealers retaliating several recent arrests, police say .

"(CNN) -- Liverpool manager Rafael Benitez insists Fernando Torres is happy at the English Premier League club after Manchester City were linked with a multi-million dollar bid for the Spain striker. Torres has scored 18 goals in 22 league games for Liverpool this season but will miss the rest of the campaign after having surgery on a knee injury, meaning the 26-year-old faces a race to be fit for Spain's opening game in the World Cup against Switzerland on June 16. City spent over $100 million in the transfer market before the start of this season and are currently battling for fourth spot in the league, which would guarantee a lucrative Champions League place. Liverpool, meanwhile, sit in seventh place and look set to miss out on qualification for the money-spinning tournament. It has led to speculation that Torres could be top of City's wanted list once the season ends. City's Italian manager Roberto Mancini told reporters: ""We are a top team and I think all the top teams are interested in Torres but sometimes it depends on the player because they want to play in the Champions League. ""For me, he is with Carlos [Tevez], [Wayne] Rooney, [Lionel] Messi, [Zlatan] Ibrahimovic, [Cristiano] Ronaldo as the best in Europe. Fernando is a fantastic striker; all the teams in Europe would like him."" The City manager did admit a successful pursuit of Torres may only come about if the club can secure Champions League football next season: ""If we don't get into the fourth position I think it will be difficult,"" he said. Liverpool were knocked out of Champions League in the group stages but have progressed to the semifinal of the Europa League against Atletico Madrid. They lost the first leg 1-0 in the Spanish capital on Thursday. After the game Benitez dismissed the possibility of Torres leaving the club. He told reporters: ""Torres is happy. The thing he's thinking about now is being ready as soon as possible and that's it. From the beginning, he's said he's been very happy at Anfield. ""We have said repeatedly that Fernando is not for sale and he still has three years of his contract remaining, so how can they sign a player who does not wish to leave?""","Manchester City express an interest in signing Liverpool striker Fernando Torres .

"(CNN)  -- Robin Dehaven usually replaces windows. On Thursday morning, after a small plane crashed into an Austin, Texas, office building, he was breaking them, having rushed into the burning structure to help people escape. Dehaven, an Army veteran who works for a glass company, was driving to a job when he witnessed the plane crash. With the building in flames and emergency personnel still minutes away, Dehaven drove his truck to the parking lot. People in the building were trapped, screaming for help. ""[Other people who'd gathered] said they needed my ladders on my truck, because there were people stuck on the second floor,"" Dehaven told CNN's ""The Situation Room."" He took a ladder off his truck and put it up to a window of a smoke-filled area where five people were trapped. ""The people were kind of in a panic, wanting to get out quickly, of course, so I climbed up into the building with them,"" Dehaven said. He then broke a nearby window under which the ladder could have better footing, and he helped the five escape, he said. See iReport photos and videos from the scene . Dehaven was one of several people who rushed to the site to help, local reports and the Texas governor's office said. ""In true Texas form, first responders and everyday citizens responded to today's plane crash with selfless acts of heroism, securing the area, evacuating the building and controlling the fire, and are to be commended,"" Texas Gov. Rick Perry said in a written statement Thursday. Authorities said they believe pilot Joseph Andrew Stack III, 53, of Austin, intentionally crashed the small aircraft into the building, where nearly 200 Internal Revenue Service employees worked. Authorities said Stack apparently had a grudge against the IRS. The remains of two people were found in the building after the crash, and 13 other people were injured -- one seriously -- authorities said. The identities of the dead weren't released as of Thursday evening. Witnesses described a scene of panic, fire and smoke. Lyric Olivarez, who was working in a nearby building, told CNN affiliate KXAN that she felt her building shake when the plane crashed. ""It sounded like an explosion, but it felt like an earthquake,"" Olivarez said. ""Someone came into our office and said there was a bomb in the building next door. We had no idea it was a plane at the time."" When she and others ran outside, they saw the neighboring building in flames. ""People on the second and third floors were busting out windows, screaming, 'Help me! Help me! Get me out of here!' waving handkerchiefs or whatever they could find,"" Olivarez told KXAN. ""Not before long, the entire parking lot was filled with smoke, and people praying and crying,"" she said. ""I just saw smoke and flames,"" said CNN iReporter Mike Ernest. ""I could not believe what I was seeing. It was just smoke and flames everywhere."" Dehaven said that as he was driving before the crash, he could see the plane flying low, approaching the building. ""I saw it turn and start heading down like it was diving to come in for a landing, but there's no landing [strip],"" he said. ""So I knew it was going to crash."" He said his 6½ years in the Army, with two tours in Iraq, helped him Thursday. ""I've had some experience in triage and battlefield, with ... gunfire,"" he said. ""My first thought [was] maybe I can help, because I'm more used to dealing with traumatic situations like that.

"(CNN) -- A tornado almost a mile wide tore through Mississippi on Saturday, killing at least 10 people and causing significant injuries and damage as it raked cities from the central western border with Louisiana northeastward to Alabama. Two of the dead were children and one was a 3-month-old baby, according to Mississippi Emergency Management Agency (MEMA) spokesman Jeff Rent. The death toll is expected to rise as rescue crews reach hard-hit areas where structures have been badly damaged, said another MEMA spokesman, Greg Flynn. Five of the dead were from Choctaw County, in the north central part of of the state, four were from Yazoo County, north of Jackson, and one was from Holmes County, also in the north central Mississippi, he said. Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, who was in Yazoo City where his home is located, called the twister ""gigantic"" and said that ""in places [it] seemed to be to be several miles wide."" Some residents were trapped in badly damaged homes, he said. ""They're working to get to the people and rescue as many as they can,"" said Dan Turner, a spokesman for the governor, reporting ""significant injuries"" in at least three counties. Residents from the region shared tales of tragedy and survival on Saturday evening. Dale Thrasher was inside Yazoo City's Hillcrest Baptist Church when it was flattened by the tornado. ""I went in the sanctuary and got under the pulpit table and the whole building fell around me,"" he said. His injuries: ""three little scratches."" Rob and Ashley Saxton were driving to a Yazoo City restaurant owned by Rob's father -- planning to take shelter in the restaurant's walk-in freezer ahead of the tornado -- when the twister blew out the car's windows at a red light. The car was tossed across the intersection, then picked up again and flung into the restaurant. ""When the windows exploded it wasn't like anything I've ever experienced,"" Rob Saxton said. ""It was amazing. It scared us plumb to death."" Watch Gov. Barbour's update on storm damage in Yazoo City . In all, 12 counties were reporting injuries, with some of the injured airlifted to a Level 1 trauma center at the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, said Jeff Rent, a MEMA spokesman. The hospital has 27 patients with injuries sustained in the tornado, including eight adults in critical condition and six children in serious condition, according to spokesman Jim Albritton. Many tornado victims were seeking attention at King's Daughters hospital in Yazoo City, where only one doctor was on duty Saturday night, said Jess Silvino, a nurse there. The hospital is expecting ""another one or two waves of victims"" as crews are able to fully access the tornado's path, said Richard Summers, chairman of emergency medicine at the medical center. The hospital has crews in Yazoo City and Lexington that have been ""amazed and astounded"" by the amount of damage they're seeing, Summers said. The state's emergency management officials have set up a command post near U.S. 49 in Yazoo City and the state has activated a 25-person rapid response team from Hattiesburg that is capable of search and rescue operations. my601.com: Local reports of damage, fatalities . The governor said he is activating local members of the National Guard in Yazoo City to maintain order. President Obama has ""been briefed on the tragedy in Mississippi and the situation is being followed by the White House,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said. Barbour said that he has not yet requested emergency federal aid but that he plans to do so on Monday. ""FEMA is in contact and coordination with our state and local partners and stand ready to help if a request is made,"" said Brad Carroll, a spokesman for the Federal Emergency Management Agancy. Mississippi residents reported that the path of the twister was a half-mile to a mile wide, said Mark McAllister, a forecaster with the National Weather Service in Jackson. CNN meteorologist Jacqui Jeras said the tornado had traveled 150 miles across Mississippi, starting in the western part of the state and moving northeast before weakening as it moved into Alabama. In Yazoo City, Fire Chief Roy Wilson said that between 20 to 30 houses were destroyed, and said some people were trapped inside structures. Wilson said he didn't yet have confirmed numbers on injuries. ""It's in pretty bad shape so far,"" he said of the city. Speaking to reporters in Yazoo City, Barbour said that 17 injured have been taken to a hospital via ambulance and that two others were airlifted to Jackson. ""By God's grace [the tornado] did not go into the most central part of the city, the most populous. However, it went through the southern edge and eastern edge of town in a number of large neighborhoods,"" he said. ""A number of businesses have been destroyed and others severely damaged -- there are churches that have been obliterated."" The sheriff's department in nearby Hinds County is sending two dozen deputies and 100 inmates to assist with the response in Yazoo County and to clear debris, MEMA said. Have you been affected by severe weather? Send in pics, video . In Eagle Lake, near the Louisiana border, about 30 homes were destroyed, Turner said. In Holmes County, 50 homes sustained structural damage, the National Weather Service reported. Parts of three highways were closed due to downed trees and other damage: State Highway 3 in Yazoo County and State Highways 14 and 17 in Holmes County, according to the the Mississippi Department of Transportation. On I-55, traffic was down to a single lane in each direction in parts of Holmes County and in the area north of Pickens, the transportation department said. Linda Green, a dispatcher with the Issaquena County Sheriff's Department, said there was minimal damage in the area around Valley Park, and a few power lines were down. No injuries have been reported in Valley Park after the twister ripped through around 11:30 a.m. (12:30 p.m. ET), she added. Valley Park is in Issaquena County, while Yazoo City is located in Yazoo County. Issaquena County is in the western part of the state, north of Vicksburg. Saturday's tornado was part of a broad band of storms that stretched from Missouri to the Florida Panhandle, Jeras said. The storm system struck Louisiana before it moved into Mississippi. A Tallulah, Louisiana, police dispatcher said a chemical plant in the city had been damaged, but could not give further details. Turner, the Mississippi governor's spokesman, said emergency response teams had been slowed by people out surveying the effects of the storm. ""One of the biggest obstacles is, of course, people are curious and want to get out and see the damage,"" he said. ""We've urged people to stay away from those areas, not only because it slows down the emergency response, but there are also still live electrical wires, there are open gas lines that will have to be shut down.""","NEW: At least 10 have been killed, including a 3-month-old, state emergency official says .

You took my favorite singer, Michael Jackson. I just wanted to let you know, my favorite president is Barack Obama. Amen."" The page has received more than 600,000 ""thumbs-up"" messages of approval since it was posted April 10. But its owner, who does not disclose his or her identity on the popular social media site, wrote, ""We are not really praying for the death of Obama. It is just some humor to show our disapproval of our current president."" Similar imprecations were circulating online last year. But Facebook spokesman Andrew Noyes said that ""while it may be considered distasteful and objectionable to some,"" the page doesn't violate the company's content policies. ""We're sensitive to content that includes pornography, bullying, hate speech, and actionable threats of violence, and we react quickly to remove content that violates our policies when it is reported to us,"" Noyes said in a written statement.

""We encourage users to report such content, and we have a large team of professional reviewers who evaluate these reports and take action per our policies."" Variations on the jab have circulated in New Jersey, where teacher's union officials apologized for a nearly identical memo that substituted Gov. Chris Christie for Obama earlier this month. Christie is locked in a bitter struggle with the New Jersey Education Association over funding for state schools, but union President Barbara Keshishian said, ""Language such as that has no place in civil discourse.""

"(CNN) -- Lawmakers in Ukraine scuffled with each other, throwing punches and eggs, as parliament met Tuesday to ratify a treaty with Russia that extends the latter's navy presence in the Ukraine's Crimean peninsula until 2042. The ruling Regions party eventually ratified the treaty but not before howls of protest from the opposition. Someone set off a smoke bomb inside the building, while Speaker Volodymyr Lytvyn sought refuge behind an umbrella as he was pelted with eggs. During a rally attended by thousands on Saturday, opposition leader Yulia Tymoshenko -- the former prime minister who lost to Viktor Yanukovych in the presidential election run-off in February -- said the ratification must be prevented at all costs. She claimed that Yanukovych is ""selling out"" Ukraine, has ""openly embarked on the path of destruction of (Ukraine's) national interests, and has actually begun the process of eliminating the state's sovereignty."" The deal was signed last week by Yanukovych and Russian President Dmitry Medvedev. Tymoshenko said it violated part of the Ukrainian Constitution, which forbids the country from hosting foreign military bases after 2017. The deal extends Russia's lease of a major naval base in the Black Sea port of Sevastopol for an additional 25 years, in exchange for a 30 percent cut in the price of natural gas that Russia sells to Ukraine. The agreement may bring an end to years of disputes over natural gas prices, which culminated in Russia turning off the pipeline to Ukraine. The dispute affected not only Ukrainians, but many Europeans who depend on Russian gas pumped through Ukraine. The two countries had been at odds ever since the ""Orange Revolution"" swept Yanukovych's fiercely anti-Russian predecessor Viktor Yushchenko to power in 2005. Throughout his time in office, Yushchenko repeatedly threatened to expel Russia's Black Sea Fleet from Sevastopol. The Russian military lease there was scheduled to expire in 2017. Yanukovych said the new deal added a ""concrete and pragmatic dimension"" to centuries of relations between Ukrainians and Russians. Opposition groups in Ukraine, however, were quick to denounce the agreement. Yuschenko's ""Our Ukraine"" party said the treaty would lead to the ""Russification"" of Ukraine.","Punches, eggs and smokebombs thrown in Ukraine parliament .

"(CNN) -- The defense attorney appointed to represent an Alabama professor accused of shooting her colleagues said Friday he regrets describing her as ""wacko."" But at a news conference, Roy Miller said ""something's wrong with this lady."" He also said his client, Amy Bishop, is ""aware of what she's done and she's very sorry for it."" Bishop is under suicide watch in jail, Miller said. In an interview Thursday with CNN affiliate WHNT after visiting Bishop, Miller said, ""I just think the case speaks for itself."" He added, ""I think she's wacko."" At Friday's news conference, he referred to that remark. ""Good lord, y'all,"" Miller said. ""Listen, I went overboard with that. When I talk to y'all I make statements ... I wish I hadn't have made. And probably that's one of them."" He added that he was trying to imply that the facts of the case ""speak for themselves."" Bishop told him she does not remember the incident, Miller said. But now, ""she knows she's killed some folks, I'm sure."" The biology professor is charged with capital murder and three counts of attempted murder in the shootings at the University of Alabama in Huntsville last week. At the end of a biology department faculty meeting at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, Bishop suddenly ""just stood up and shot,"" a professor who survived the incident told CNN affiliate WAAY. Three of Bishop's colleagues were killed; three others were wounded. Bishop, a Harvard-trained geneticist, had recently been denied tenure. Bishop, a professor and researcher at the university, was arrested as she was leaving the building. A 9 mm handgun was found inside, on the second floor. A university spokesman, Ray Garner, identified the dead as Gopi Podila, chairman of the biological sciences department; Maria Davis, associate professor of biology; and Adriel Johnson, associate professor of biology. Miller said his client is ""trying to keep from cracking up down there emotionally,"" and is worried that if she breaks down, officials in the jail might think she's going to commit suicide. Discussing his client's mind, he said that doctors of biology ""have got, in my estimation, high IQs -- and the high IQ in my opinion is sometimes not good for people."" He said Bishop sometimes is ""so focused on the mental basis"" that she ""does not know what's going on around her."" He said he believes the case will boil down to Bishop's mental state at the time of the killings. In the wake of the shootings, information came to light about previous run-ins with the law Bishop had. She faced criminal charges after an altercation at a Massachusetts restaurant nearly eight years ago, police said. The police report says Bishop became furious that there was no booster seat available for her child, began screaming at the woman who had taken the last one and struck her in the head. Authorities previously have said Bishop, who is also known as Amy Bishop Anderson, fatally shot her brother in the family's Braintree, Massachusetts, home in 1986. The shooting was ruled accidental, but after a review of the incident after the Alabama shootings, Norfolk County District Attorney William Keating issued a statement saying that probable cause had existed in 1986 to charge Bishop with assault with a dangerous weapon, carrying a dangerous weapon and unlawful possession of ammunition. However, the statute of limitations on those charges has expired, as well as on a potential charge of ""wanton and reckless conduct"" -- the lowest standard for manslaughter in Massachusetts, Keating said. In addition, the Boston Globe reported Monday that Bishop and her husband, Jim Anderson, were questioned in the 1993 attempted mail bombing of a Harvard Medical School professor. Jim Anderson said on Monday that federal investigators had gathered ""a dozen subjects"" in the attempted bombing, but ""there were never any suspects. Never anyone charged, never anyone arrested. Then five years later, we got a letter from the ATF saying, 'You are in the clear.' ""","There's ""something wrong with this lady,"" attorney Roy Miller says .

"Washington (CNN) -- The seizure of the Afghan Taliban's top military leader in Pakistan represents a turning point in the U.S.-led war against the militants, U.S. officials and analysts said. The arrest of Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar represents the most significant Taliban capture since the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, a senior Obama administration official said Tuesday. Baradar has been a close associate of Osama bin Laden's and is seen as the No. 2 figure in the Afghan Taliban, behind Mullah Mohammed Omar. ""If anyone would know where the senior leaders are of al Qaeda and the Taliban, then Baradar is someone who would be privy to that kind of information,"" said M.J. Gohel, executive director of the Asia-Pacific Foundation. It's ""major success for the CIA"" and ""a major blow for the Taliban,"" Gohel said. The United States has tried to target Baradar for years, a senior U.S. official said. The arrest also represents a ""new level of cooperation"" between Pakistani and American forces working to rout the Taliban, said U.S. Sen. John Kerry, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and co-author of legislation designed to improve cooperation between Pakistan and the United States. Described as a savvy and modern military leader, Baradar was arrested in the southern Pakistani city of Karachi several days ago, a senior Pakistani intelligence official said. The official asked not to be named because he is not authorized to speak to the media. Baradar is being held in joint custody and investigated by both the CIA and Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence agency, another senior Pakistani source said. Qari Yousuf Ahmadi, a Taliban spokesman in Afghanistan, denied that Baradar had been captured. He said Baradar is continuing his operations and is in Afghanistan. Another Afghan Taliban spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, also denied Baradar had been arrested. He said reports of his arrest are designed to demoralize the Afghan Taliban. Despite confirmation of the arrest by Pakistani sources, Pakistani Interior Minister Rehman Malik said he could not verify reports of the capture. He also denied reports the CIA and ISI conducted a secret raid that captured Baradar, saying the agencies share intelligence but that the CIA does not conduct raids on Pakistani soil. Afghanistan Crossroads blog: More on Baradar and the Taliban . Several raids in Karachi last week netted dozens of suspected Afghan militants, and intelligence agencies are in the process of verifying their identities, Malik said. Baradar's arrest occurred as some 15,000 Afghan and NATO forces were battling the Taliban in the Marjah region of southern Afghanistan's Helmand province in the largest NATO offensive since the U.S.-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001. It also comes weeks after the CIA ratcheted up its operations against the Taliban in apparent response to a December suicide attack that killed seven CIA officers in eastern Afghanistan. And the arrest comes amid reports of major successes for the United States in its battle against the Taliban and associated militants in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Hakimullah Mehsud, died recently after reports that a suspected U.S. drone strike targeted him in January, according to Taliban and Pakistani intelligence sources. The previous leader of the Pakistani Taliban, Baitullah Mehsud, also died in a suspected U.S. drone strike. CNN national security analyst Peter Bergen called Baradar's capture a ""huge deal,"" saying he is ""arguably more important than Mullah Omar from a military point of view, because Mullah Omar really is more of a religious figure than an operational commander of the Taliban."" ""This guy also is the No. 2 political figure in the Taliban. The fact that he was discovered in Karachi is very significant. Karachi is the largest city in Pakistan. It's a long way from where the war is being fought,"" Bergen said Monday on CNN's ""Anderson Cooper 360°."" The capture ""indicates that the Pakistani intelligence services and CIA [are] cooperating very closely on a very high-value target."" A number of high-value targets, including Omar, have moved into Karachi from a region near the Pakistan-Afghanistan border, where the Pakistani military and suspected U.S. drones have battled Taliban militants, a senior U.S. official said. Bergen said the operation suggests the Pakistanis are willing to move not only against the Pakistani Taliban but also against the Afghan Taliban, which has its headquarters in Pakistan. Baradar also would have been in regular contact with Omar, Bergen added. Robin Wright, a fellow at the U.S. Institute of Peace, called the move a ""huge catch in terms of understanding the organization,"" but she also said the ""Taliban is in many ways a decentralized force, and it's not necessarily that he is going to be involved in knowing what every single unit on the ground is doing."" ""The critical issue is how much will he talk and provide information on where other assets are, potentially where the Taliban in Pakistan are, and, of course, the United States would love to know where Osama bin Laden himself is,"" Wright said on ""AC 360."" Wright also raised the issue of what will happen to Baradar when the interrogation concludes. ""One of the big questions, of course, is, what are they going to do with him?"" Wright asked. ""They can't take him to Guantanamo Bay. Are the Pakistanis going to prosecute him?"" According to Interpol, Baradar was born in 1968 in Weetmak village in the Dehrwood District of Uruzgan province in southern Afghanistan. Bergen said Baradar and Omar run the Quetta Shura, which operates in southern Afghanistan. ""In terms of the information about the southern Afghanistan operations of the Taliban, this guy is potentially a gold mine,"" Bergen said. ""I suspect he's not being read his Miranda rights by these Pakistani people who are interrogating him."" Muhammad Amir Rana, director of the Pakistan Institute for Peace Studies, a Pakistani think tank, called Baradar ""basically the de facto leader"" of the Taliban. ""With Mullah Omar staying out of the scene, Baradar was running the operations of the Taliban."" Baradar and Omar ""started the Taliban together. He was in the movement since the very beginning,"" Rana said. ""He is a very skilled military tactician. When the Taliban were in government in Afghanistan, he was the supreme commander of the army and was heading the charge against the Northern Alliance holdouts at that point in time."" Rana said the setback is significant because Baradar was directing the Taliban's activities in Afghanistan at the time of his arrest. ""His capture would be a severe blow to the Taliban morale at a time when the operation in the Helmand province is under way."" Rana said Baradar and Afghan President Hamid Karzai hail from the same Popalzai tribe. Karzai has talked about reaching out to some Taliban members, and a Newsweek profile of Baradar last year said that ""Baradar once authorized a Taliban delegation that approached Karzai with a peace offer"" and that he approved peace feelers to Karzai's brother. Those efforts didn't go anywhere, the magazine said. Reva Bhalla, director of analysis at the Stratfor think tank, said Baradar has been representing Omar at some of the peace talks going on behind the scenes with the Saudis and describes his capture as a big catch. Bhalla said the Pakistanis didn't do this for free; they want concessions from the United States, and it's a shift in the strategy on how it's dealing with the Afghan Taliban in its own territory. The Pakistanis have launched offensives against the Pakistani Taliban, and now the move indicates they might plan to get tough on the Afghan Taliban. ""It's not like you have one guy, and that immediately opens the door to everyone else. It's hard to believe that this will lead to this huge intelligence coup. But if the Pakistanis are shifting their mode of cooperation, that is significant.""

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- Tiger Woods' comments Friday may become the most scrutinized apology in history, fodder for dinner tables and Internet chat rooms alike: Was he genuine? Was it a PR stunt? Can he do anything to restore people's faith in him? The biggest knock on golf's biggest star is that it took him three months to utter any words publicly about his infidelity and then did so in a controlled environment. That's a no-no, according to apology etiquette. ""If you have to take time to say 'sorry,' you're not being authentic. We don't need extra time to rationalize whether we're sorry or not,"" said Glenn Llopis, the founder of the Center for Innovation & Humanity, a California-based think tank. It seems everyone is apologizing for everything these days. In February alone, there has been a bevy of ""I'm sorries,"" from a tearful John Mayer for his use of the n-word to Toyota's top boss for the automaker's repeated shortcomings. But do apologies still carry weight, or does the flood of mea culpas dilute their meaning? Lauren Bloom, a business ethics expert and the author of ""The Art of the Apology,"" says, ""It's never too late to say 'I'm sorry.' ""But saying 'I'm sorry' in a tightly controlled environment,"" she says, ""makes it look more and more like an exercise in 'let's check the box and do what my PR people tell me to do.' "" Woods delivered his apology in front of a small hand-picked crowd that was not allowed to ask questions. ""I was unfaithful. I had affairs. I cheated,"" he said. ""I am the only person to blame."" Read full story about Woods' apology . How would Bloom rate Woods' authenticity? ""I thought he was very authentic,"" she said, adding with a laugh, ""He was most authentic when he was attacking the media."" ""But I think he was very sincere. I think he had a very tough thing to say today, and he sucked it up and did well."" Bloom has six essentials to an effective apology: Say sorry sincerely; take responsibility; make amends; express appreciation to fans and friends who have stuck by you; listen to the people affected by your actions; and do better next time. ""He did pretty well. He checked all the boxes,"" she said. ""We now have got to see changed behavior. ... I hope he follows through on it. I think America would love to welcome him back."" Watch Tiger Woods' apology . Bloom says the importance of an apology shouldn't be overlooked. There was a time, she says, when people viewed apologizing for your actions as weak. That perception has since changed, because Americans now recognize that people are inherently flawed. ""Folks are starting to wake up to that,"" she said. ""Most of the time, people are ready to forgive and forget."" Who has given an effective public apology? She says actor Hugh Grant, who hit the talk show circuit immediately after his infamous encounter with a prostitute in 1995. A bad apology? John Edwards, according to Bloom. ""Serial apologies,"" she says, ""they never work."" In his apology, Woods said that he had undergone 45 days of in-patient treatment and that he would return to therapy Saturday. ""I have a long way to go, but I've taken my first steps,"" Woods said. ""I need to regain my balance and be centered."" Therapist Gregory Jantz, who has treated sex addiction for 25 years, says relapse is common. His Seattle-based facility has seen only a 5 percent ""full recovery"" of addicts. ""This is not a go-into-rehab-and-be-finished type of addiction."" An apology is important and a good step in the recovery process, Jantz says, but from a therapist's standpoint, it was important to hear him say: ""Not only did I goof up, but I need ongoing help."" As for Llopis, he says Woods might've won some people over. ""He did a fairly good attempt to capture the heart, but is he forgiven for what he's done? No,"" he said. ""There's nothing he can say in my book,"" he added, ""that would make me view him as authentic and genuine and human again.""","""If you have to take time to say 'sorry,' you're not being authentic,"" ethicist says .

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, one of the oldest civil rights groups in the nation, will announce the successor to Chairman Julian Bond on Saturday as the organization strives to prove its relevance and influence to a new generation. NAACP Vice Chair Roslyn Brock has emerged as the favorite to fill the seat left by Bond, a civil rights leader who has held the post since 1998. Bond, a stalwart of the civil rights movement, helped found the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, known for its student sit-ins in the early 1960s, and served as the first president of the Southern Poverty Law Center. He served in both houses of the Georgia Legislature, totaling two decades in office, before leading the NAACP. ""I think he's been enormously effective; he's just a thoughtful person with a rich history in civil rights struggles,"" said historian Patricia A. Sullivan, whose book, ""Raise Every Voice,"" chronicled the history of the NAACP. Sullivan said Bond brought his experiences from the forefront of the civil rights movement to his role as chairman to take on disparities in the criminal justice system, education, housing and unemployment to the national level. Most recently, amid internal, grass-roots level tensions over whether the NAACP would support same-sex marriage, Bond appeared at the National Equality March in Washington in October. ""I'm fond of saying there's no such thing as saying gay rights or black rights. There's civil rights, and every American deserves civil rights,"" he said at the time. ""He's very clear on what has long been the NAACP message of civil rights and inclusive democracy,"" Sullivan said. Bond also is known for some of his political criticism, doling it out consistently against the Republican Party and the Bush administration in the earlier years of his tenure. At the 2001 NAACP convention, which was held before the September 11 attacks, Bond sharply criticized some of President George W. Bush's political appointments, saying Bush had ""selected nominees from the Taliban wing of American politics, appeased the wretched appetites of the extreme right wing and chosen Cabinet officials whose devotion to the Confederacy is nearly canine in its uncritical affection."" Bush spoke before the NAACP in 2000, during his first run for the presidency, but he did not make another appearance until 2006, during his second term. Bond has called out Democrats as well, complaining they are too often ""not an opposition; they're an amen corner. ... When one party is shameless, the other party cannot afford to be spineless."" ""Julian has been very effective,"" said Mary Frances Berry, former chairwoman of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights. ""He came out of a tradition of conflict and advocacy, and has taken on people rather vocally at times. ""Probably, the next person will need to take into account the change in terms of people they're dealing with."" Bond, 70, indicated he was ready to leave the organization in 2008, but stayed on in 2009 as the NAACP celebrated its 100th anniversary. At the time, there was talk about whether the organization was still relevant in what some observers called a ""post-racial"" United States. John McWhorter, a linguist and conservative political commentator, spelled it out in a February 2009 column titled, ""If the NAACP ceased to exist tomorrow, would it have a significant effect on black America?"" For Bond, the answer was obvious. ""We have for the first time a black man who can open the doors to Air Force One, but we now know his children couldn't go to a pool in Philadelphia,"" Bond said in July, referring to a decision by a suburban Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, swim club to revoke privileges of a largely minority day care center last year. ""So, as long as this disparity exists, we're not the national association for the advancement of one colored person, we want all colored people to advance,"" he continued. ""And for us, people come in all colors -- black, brown, yellow, everything. We want everyone to advance, everyone to progress, and until that's true, the NAACP is going to be here."" To ensure it will be here, the organization has showcased youthful leaders among its ranks, most notably by tapping Benjamin Todd Jealous as its president in 2008. At 35, Jealous was the youngest person to hold the post at the NAACP. Berry, who now teaches history at the University of Pennsylvania, was on the NAACP search committee at the time. ""It's a generational change,"" she said Friday. ""The organization is clearly doing what every organization should do. They should renew their leadership and reach out to the next generation. ... Otherwise they'll die."" Selecting Brock -- who made history in February 2001 when she was unanimously elected vice chair of the NAACP National Board of Directors at age 35, making her the youngest and first women to get the job -- as chairwoman will only support that vision, Berry said. ""She's very different from Julian. But the fact that she's younger, vibrant, very dynamic -- I think it's great,"" Sullivan said. ""It's an important position, and I think having someone like her in that position says something."" She added that the NAACP has managed to stay effective by maintaining its large grass-roots support, with chapters in every corner of the country. Bond, in his interview last year, said, ""What we do has not changed -- we fight racial discrimination. But the way in which we do it has changed remarkably."" ""We need to be more aggressive, we need more members, we need to do more of everything we do right now,"" he said. ""I've never thought we were the perfect organization. I've always thought we could do better tomorrow than we do today."" In his speech on the 100th anniversary of the NAACP, President Obama said ""the pain of discrimination is still felt in America"" among African-Americans, Latinos and Muslim-Americans. ""Even as we inherit extraordinary progress that cannot be denied, even as we marvel at the courage and determination of so many plain folks, we know that too many barriers still remain,"" he said. For the NAACP, that means there is decades of work left to be done.","NAACP Vice Chair Roslyn Brock has emerged as the favorite .

"Editor's Note: CNN.com has a business partnership with CareerBuilder.com, which serves as the exclusive provider of job listings and services to CNN.com. This article first appeared in September 2005. (CareerBuilder.com) -- Are skyrocketing gasoline prices cursing your commute? Wondering why you're driving to work only to spend your hard-earned dollars to get you there and back? Perhaps telecommuting is the answer. Telecommuting is changing the way we work. An estimated 10 percent of today's workforce works from home and remains on the company payroll. And a recent study commissioned by Bell Atlantic estimates that 2 million American businesses support some kind of telecommuting program. Employees who telecommute largely report that they are happier with their jobs and more satisfied with their personal lives. A survey by the Information Technology Association of America even found that 36 percent of respondents would choose telecommuting over a pay raise. Increased quality of life sits at the top of the list of employee benefits along with reduced stress levels, greater flexibility and increased productivity. And contrary to the popular ""out of sight, out of mind"" misconception that telecommuting will take you off the fast track, a study of 17,000 telecommuters by the U.S. Small Business Administration (Myths and Realities of Working at Home) found that teleworkers receive a higher proportion of promotions than their stay-at-work counterparts. Employers in turn benefit from reduced real estate costs and absenteeism, increased productivity, morale and employer turnover costs. In addition, many find that telecommuting seems to encourage certain entrepreneurial qualities in their employees, including drive, self-discipline, self-reliance and improved judgment. There are benefits to the community as well: reduced fossil fuel consumption and traffic congestion which lead to cleaner air and safer neighborhoods. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, if an additional 10 percent of the nation's workforce would telecommute just one day a week, Americans would avoid the frustration of driving 24.4 million miles, breathe air with 13,000 tons less air pollution and conserve more than 1.2 million gallons of fuel each week. Are you a candidate for telecommuting? Certain jobs such as writers, salespersons, accountants, programmers, graphic artists, researchers, engineers, architects and public relations professionals lend themselves to telecommuting better than others. You also need to have the right personal qualities. For example, do you have the self-discipline to work from home under minimal supervision? Does your boss perceive you as a self-starter who can work independently? Are you a proven performer? Well-organized? A good time-manager? If the answers are yes, you may want to propose a telecommuting arrangement with your employer. To do so successfully, follow the same principles you would in a job interview. Focus on the benefits of telecommuting to the company, not the benefits to you. State only that telecommuting will make you more productive and efficient, be a better use of the time you currently spend on the road, make your boss's life easier -- whatever benefits you come up with that focus on the employer's needs, not yours. Outline in writing your job description and assure your boss that you'll meet your responsibilities. Emphasize that you know what needs to be done and that telecommuting won't significantly change that. You may even want to include a table that shows which of your job functions will be accomplished off-site, which will be performed in the traditional workplace and which can be done at either location. Describe how you will handle key relationships with other team members. Think about yourself the same way you would if you were looking for a new job. What is your unique selling proposition? How are you an asset to your employer, and what do you do better then anyone else in your company? By effectively communicating your value to your employer, you'll be better able to sell your boss on the idea of letting you telework. E-mail to a friend . Copyright CareerBuilder.com 2009.

"New York (CNN) -- A new report saying that Iran could be secretly working on a nuclear weapon is a major development, but not one that should lead the U.S. to consider a military strike against the Tehran regime, according to analyst Fareed Zakaria. The draft report, obtained by CNN and not yet approved by the International Atomic Energy Agency's board of governors, is the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's strongest warning yet that Iran could be aiming to build a nuclear bomb. Zakaria told CNN the report should spur U.S. diplomacy to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons but that talk by commentators outside the U.S. government of a potential military strike against Iran was wrongheaded. ""To be casually talking about military action because we're getting frustrated seems to me somewhat dangerous,"" he said. Iran's Green Movement of protesters against the regime indicates that waiting could have its benefits, Zakaria said. ""At the end of the day, time is not on the side of this regime. It's a dysfunctional regime that has run the economy into the ground, taken a great and open and proud nation and turned it into a kind of paranoid and closed one and which is clearly losing the support of young Iranians by the day."" Zakaria, author and host of CNN's ""Fareed Zakaria GPS,"" spoke to CNN on Thursday. CNN: The International Atomic Energy Agency has done a report saying that Iran could be at work on building a nuclear weapon. What do you think that means? Fareed Zakaria: That's a major development because so far we have not really been able to assess whether Iran has decided definitively that it wants nuclear weapons. We know that it wants a nuclear capacity -- that is clear -- and it wants a large nuclear capacity and one that is robust so that they have multiple production sites. But it has always seemed as though there were two views within the Iranian leadership. One was that Iran should develop a robust civilian nuclear capability and a robust missile program but that it should not put the two together because that would place it in clear violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. There are clearly others in Iran who believe that Iran should simply have nuclear weapons. ... This would suggest that the harder line faction within Iran is winning out. We don't know for sure because this is all guesswork frankly. ... CNN: What's happening with the negotiations? Zakaria: The Iranians have been playing a very peculiar negotiating game where they sometimes seem interested in negotiating but rarely do they actually engage in good faith. ... They rarely seem to engage in these with a consistent pattern with consistent positions -- which either means the leadership is very divided or they're playing games. CNN: What's your view about the wisdom of imposing new sanctions? Zakaria: It probably is the only course available right now since the prospect of engaging with Iran and giving it positive inducements does not seem to be going anywhere. I also think the sanctions that are being talked about are fairly narrow and targeted at particularly the Republican Guard within the regime, which seems to be most powerful faction. And that's the right approach to take. We know that generalized sanctions only hurt the average Iranian, and that is entirely counterproductive. CNN: What's the impact of the domestic turbulence inside Iran, including the protest movement? Zakaria: Nobody knows for sure, but it does seem to have confused the situation internally. [Iranian President Mahmoud] Ahmadinejad had made some conciliatory statements on the nuclear issue, which were then attacked by the opposition, and he retracted it, which suggests that he's feeling the pressure. It suggests that there are divisions within the regime, there's some sense of vulnerability. ... It just makes it more difficult to negotiate with them, but it also suggests it may not be the worst thing in the world to wait and watch how this plays out in Iran. CNN: What do you think about the military option? Zakaria: The problems with the military option remain what they've always been, and it's a little alarming to see the way in which people are gravitating toward a military option, out of a sort of frustration that there isn't some magical solution here. The military option is certainly not a magical solution. It's a very risky strategy with many potentially large, unintended consequences. A military strike would be a pre-emptive invasion of another country by the United States. It would not have any sanction in international law. It would not be supported by the vast majority of the world, and it would only delay rather than destroy the Iranian program. I've talked to many military experts, and we do not seem to have the ability to completely destroy a program like this, partly because nuclear technology is after all not some cutting-edge technology. This is 60-year old technology, and there are lots of people in Iran who are trained scientists. It would also strengthen the hard-line elements within the regime, would weaken the Green Movement because they would have to come out in support of the regime, and against what would be a foreign attack on Iranian soil. It would inflame the Middle East and make tensions rise everywhere, including the two places where the U.S. has a huge stake and tens of thousands of troops -- Afghanistan and Iraq -- and it would put the moderate Arabs on the defense. It would have the effect of radicalizing the region. And those are pretty much the known consequences. ... Then, there's always in the business of war, the unknown consequences. What would Iran's reaction be? ... What kind of militia operations could it fund in Iraq and Afghanistan that would directly kill Americans? CNN: Do you think the administration is seriously contemplating military action? Zakaria: I don't think the administration is seriously contemplating it, but I'm struck by the degree to which many outside commentators are doing it, and the danger is ... that the administration places itself in a box where it says things which leave it no option but to keep taking a harder and harder line. I don't think it's likely, but I do worry that there is a train which is leaving the station, which might end up in a military strike. CNN: Do you think Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has been sounding the right note? Zakaria: Absolutely. Secretary Clinton has been sounding the right note and being tough, making the point that they're willing to engage with the Iranians if they are serious. I also think this most recent declaration by IAEA will make it easier for us to continue building a containment strategy against Iran, getting moderate Arab countries to ally with the United States, tacitly with Israel and against Iran politically and militarily within the region, get the Europeans even more strongly on board and most crucially get the Russians and the Chinese on board for sanctions in the U.N. -- further, tighter and tougher sanctions. CNN: Aside from sanctions and watchful waiting, is there anything else that should be done? Zakaria: I think we should be supporting the Green Movement in Iran. I don't think we need to do it in a dramatic and overt kind of way, which would probably be counterproductive. But there are ways in word and deed that the United States could make clear that we support the aspirations of those Iranians who want a more normal Iran, a more open democratic Iran, more engaged with the world. That is not inconsistent with us saying we want to negotiate with Iran. We did that with the Soviet Union. If there was a way for us to construct a containment strategy that at the same time left room for negotiations on the one hand and also left room for us to express our hopes and support for a different Iran in the future, that would be the best long-term strategy for us. ... It's difficult to predict when and where things will change, but it's difficult to imagine that 25 years from now Iran will still be run by this unholy alliance of a bunch of reactionary mullahs and power-hungry military leaders.","Draft report from U.N. watchdog agency says Iran could secretly be working on a nuclear bomb .

"(CNN) -- All three people on board a twin-engine plane died Wednesday when their aircraft crashed into a residential East Palo Alto, California, neighborhood, a spokesman with the Federal Aviation Administration said. The victims were employees of Tesla Motors, a luxury electric car company. ""Three Tesla employees were on board a plane that crashed in East Palo Alto early this morning. We are withholding their identities as we work with the relevant authorities to notify the families,"" said CEO Elon Musk in a statement. ""Our thoughts and prayers are with them. Tesla is a small, tightly knit company, and this is a tragic day for us."" The Cessna 310 took off from Palo Alto Airport at 7:53 a.m., FAA spokesman Ian Gregor said. During takeoff, the plane struck 60-foot high power lines, forcing the plane down onto a driveway, said Josh Cawthra, a National Transportation Safety Board aviation accident investigator. Four homes were affected, and two had fire damage, Menlo Park Fire Chief Harold Schapelhouman said at a press conference. A day care in a house sustained heavy damage when the plane went down, East Palo Alto Police Capt. Carl Estelle said. No children were there at the time. The craft's fuselage landed in a house's yard, sparking a fire that destroyed several vehicles, Estelle said. One of the engines fell elsewhere in the neighborhood, apparently hitting the rear overhang of a yard, he said. ""Miraculously, incredibly, no one was injured on the ground,"" Schapelhouman said. The crash site was about one mile northeast of the airport, he said. The travelers were headed to Hawthorne Municipal Airport in Hawthorne, California, more than 350 miles south, according to Gregor. Gregor noted foggy conditions, but said it was not known if the weather played a role in the accident. Gregor said the cause of the crash was unknown. Patricia Armistad said she lives maybe four or five houses from the impact site. ""I heard a loud bang and when I went to my bedroom window I felt a big hit, like an earthquake,"" she said. She ran outside into the thick fog and immediately saw neighbors rushing to help, she said. Residents pulled people from the damaged houses and used their garden hoses to extinguish fires, she said. iReport: More photos from the scene . The crash triggered a massive power outage in the area. In addition to transmission lines, the aircraft also struck a transmission tower, Pacific Gas and Electric spokesman Joe Molica said. The tower and lines run electricity into neighboring Palo Alto, he said. Some 28,000 customers lost electricity, but power had been restored to all by 6:15 p.m., according to the City of Palo Alto Web site. CNN's Khadijah Rentas contributed to this report.","Plane crashes into East Palo Alto, California, neighborhood, fire chief says .

Despite no formal training, her enthusiasm to study primates led to the key discovery that chimpanzees have abilities and personalities similar to humans. Five decades on, and Dr. Goodall is now a tireless campaigner for conservation and environmental causes, especially the need to protect natural habitat. With Goodall's global Roots and Shoots movement, her work has moved from the jungle to the classroom and much of that effort has been focused on educating the next generation.

"Atlanta, Georgia (CNN) -- As soon as he heard the news about Haiti's earthquake, Myk Manon began planning to get himself and two fellow power specialists from the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association into the heart of the disaster zone. On January 16, four days after the 7.0-magnitude quake had flattened much of Port-au-Prince and killed more than 200,000 people, the three engineers flew into the Dominican Republic, then drove into Haiti's capital, parked their truck in front of the U.S. Embassy -- where they figured they'd be safe -- and went to sleep. They would need it -- the city was dark, except for a few lights from private generators, and they knew their expertise would be in demand beginning the next morning. Here's what they found: All four power plants serving the city were off line; power lines lay on the ground all over the place; the earthquake had tossed 56-ton transformers from their bases. ""They literally jumped up 10 inches and tipped over,"" said Manon, 61, a California native and former Peace Corps volunteer. After finding $65-per-night rooms in a two-story, wooden hotel that had survived the earthquake, the men set about trying to find out how much of Electricity of Haiti's (EdH) system of substations and generators had also survived. But they found that the power system had already been in extremis. Before January 12, only 60 percent of Port-au-Prince's 3 million residents had electricity; nationwide, the figure was 40 percent, Manon said. Many of them were simply stealing it, tapping lines feeding streetlights. Before the quake, the capital had 60,000 paying customers, but there were 150,000 connections to the grid, and the power company was losing $1 million to $2 million per month, he said. ""In Haiti, that's a lot of money,"" he said. He credited donations from Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez for having kept Haiti's lights on. Now, to get them on again, Manon faced the task of replacing thousands of poles, many of which had been crushed by toppling buildings. Manon and his colleagues, Bud Stanley and Christian Ponce, worked to get live lines to critical sites, like hospitals, water pumping stations and grocery stores. The men had at their disposal four trucks and 30 EdH workers, some of whom had lost their own families. As they went to work, the engineers carted what they could from the power company's warehouse, which had been condemned and was to be torn down. But there weren't enough poles, lines and other equipment needed to reilluminate a city the size of Port-au-Prince, he said. Nor were there any maps that would tell the engineers where the wires went once they left the plant. So they gave their teams GPS units and created the nation's first maps of its electrical grids, Manon said. The Haitian workers were inventive with the tools they had -- primarily pickup trucks carrying ladders -- but they had a view of safety that concerned their American counterparts. ""Safety is not a primary concern in the Haitian electric sector,"" Manon said. ""It would scare you to death."" Few wore basics, like hard hats, safety goggles or gloves, he said. Manon recalled a 1970s-vintage Ford truck that had been donated by one of their U.S.-based cooperatives to the Dominican Republic to help restore electricity after Hurricane Georges knocked out power nationwide in 1998. He made a couple of calls and found it sitting in a garage on the Dominican side of the island, paid a mechanic to get it running again, and had it driven to Haiti. That -- combined with two other trucks from the Dominican Republic and four other Haitian line trucks that ""sort of work"" and were already in the country -- was it for the specialized equipment needed to make rapid line repairs. The rest of the work is being done by people using pickup trucks and ladders, he said. They got the first of the capital's four plants back on line within 10 days of the earthquake, he said. The first place to get electricity restored was University Hospital, outside of which stacked bodies oozed fluids onto the paving stones. His biggest challenge was keeping his footing. ""Lord, don't let me fall on the bodies,"" he recalled telling himself, his voice cracking. Now, slightly more than a month after the earthquake, service has been restored to 25 percent of Haiti's customers, he said. Two of the city's four power plants are back on line, and a third is nearly ready, he said. Manon appealed Wednesday to a nationwide convention of the National Rural Electric Cooperative Association in Atlanta for help getting teams of workers and trucks to Haiti. ""If we can get four or five teams, that would help a lot,"" he said. ""The international community is going to have to come forward now."" Manon's experience with the topic goes back to 1972, when he was a Peace Corps volunteer in Managua, Nicaragua, and an earthquake destroyed the center of the city, killing thousands. But things have improved since then. Three weeks after that quake, the city still had no electricity, he said.","Engineers fly from U.S. to Dominican Republic 4 days after quake, drive to Haiti .
They find 4 power plants off line, power lines down, 56-ton transformers off their bases .
Before the quake, only 60% of capital's residents had electricity; 40% nationwide .

"Asheville, North Carolina (CNN) -- President Obama prayed Sunday with the Rev. Billy Graham at Graham's mountaintop home before leaving North Carolina to attend the memorial service for 29 West Virginia coal miners killed in a recent explosion. Obama became the first sitting U.S. president to visit Graham at his family home, according to Graham spokesman Larry Ross. He is the 12th president, dating back to Harry Truman, to meet with the so-called ""pastor to the presidents."" ""I am pleased to have had President Obama in my home this afternoon,"" Graham said in a statement, adding that Obama sought the meeting while on vacation in Asheville for the weekend. ""My son Franklin and I enjoyed a brief visit with the president, followed by a time of prayer together."" During the meeting, Ross said, Obama shared some insights about his faith and the challenges of being commander-in-chief. ""Like others before him, President Obama shared how lonely, demanding and humbling the office of president can be, and how much he appreciated the counsel of people like Mr. Graham and the prayers of so many citizens,"" Ross said. The two men also discussed their love of golf and the city of Chicago, where Graham attended school and held several of his religious crusades, Ross said. At the end, Graham presented Obama with two Bibles -- one for him and the other for first lady Michelle Obama, Ross said. The two men then prayed together, with Obama first praying for Graham and then Graham ""concluded with a prayer for the president, his family and his administration,"" according to Ross. Obama was ""extremely gratified"" that Graham made time for the meeting and private prayer, White House spokesman Bill Burton said. The visit was a follow-up to Obama's telephone call to Graham on the evangelist's 91st birthday in November, Burton said. At that time, the two agreed to meet as soon as possible, according to Burton. Ross told CNN the visit came together hastily after the White House officially inquired on Friday, after Obama arrived in North Carolina. Obama and his family vacationed in Asheville over the weekend, and the first couple played tennis Sunday morning before their departure, Burton said. The meeting with Graham came three days after the Army rescinded an invitation for Franklin Graham to speak at the Pentagon on the upcoming National Day of Prayer. The Army decision was because of controversial comments about Islam by the younger Graham. Billy Graham's statement referred to the upcoming event without mentioning the controversy involving his son. ""As we approach the National Day of Prayer on May 6, I want to encourage Christians everywhere to pray for our president, and for all those in positions of authority, and especially for the men and women serving in our military,"" Graham said in the statement. In December, Franklin Graham told CNN's Campbell Brown that ""true Islam"" could not be practiced in America because ""you can't beat your wife, you cannot murder your children if you think they've committed adultery or something like that, which they do practice in these other countries."" Franklin Graham later tried to temper his remarks by saying that he had Muslim friends. Last week, he said he regretted the Army's decision but stood by his comments. ""I don't like the way they treat women, the way they treat minorities. I just find it horrific. But I love the people of Islam,"" he said, adding some of his work has been in Muslim nations. The Army, which oversees the National Day of Prayer ceremonies at the Pentagon, feared that if Graham spoke at the Pentagon on May 6, Islamic militants would publicize his comments, potentially fueling tensions in Muslim nations such as Iraq and Afghanistan, where U.S. troops are deployed. Graham's invitation was not the only controversy swirling about the National Day of Prayer this year. Last week, a federal judge struck down as unconstitutional the 1952 law that established the day, saying it violated the ban on government-backed religion. On Thursday, the Justice Department informed a federal appeals court that the Obama administration will appeal that decision.","Obama is first sitting U.S. president to visit Graham home, Graham's spokesman says .

"(CNN)  -- Chennai Super Kings won the third staging of the Indian Premier League (IPL) as they beat Mumbai Indians by 22 runs in the final of the Twenty20 tournament on Sunday. Mumbai with home advantage and with an in-form Sachin Tendulkar in their ranks fell well short in their pursuit of the 168 for five wickets posted by Chennai in their allocated overs. Suresh Raina was the star for Chenna with an unbeaten 57 in their knock and a tight spell of bowling including the wicket of lower-order dangerman Harbhajan Singh. He posted a blistering 72-run stand with Chennai and Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni (27) but their total still looked only respectable with the likes of Tendulkar and Keith Pollard in the Mumbai ranks. But off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin immediately piled on the pressure with an opening maiden over to Shikhar Dhawan, who fell in the next over to Australia paceman Doug Bollinger as he edged to Dhoni. Tendulkar and Abhishek Nayar (27) shared a 66-run stand but just when they were upping the ante, Nayar was run out and Raina, introduced for the first time in the 12th over, also got rid of Harbhajan in the same over. The killer blow came in the 15th over when left-arm spinner Shadab Jakati had  Tendulkar caught for 48 on the boundary and then removed Saurabh Tiwary. With the Indians needing 55 from the last three overs, the crowd were silent until Pollard, who had been mysteriously kept back, smashed Bollinger for two sixes and two fours in the 18th which yielded 22 runs. However, both Rayudu (21) and Pollard fell in the penultimate over from Albie  Morkel and the game was up for Mumbai with the final action played out in near silence among the capacity crowd.","Chennai Super Kings win the final of the IPL by beating Mumbai Indians by 22 runs .

"(CNN) -- For 20 years, it has circled quietly above us, capturing a dark, secret world billions of light years away. From black holes to primordial galaxies, the Hubble Space Telescope has provided out-of-this-world images of space where no human has ever gone. NASA, the European Space Agency and the Space Telescopic Science Institute celebrated Hubble's 20th year in orbit on Saturday by releasing another stunning photo caught by the iconic telescope. The striking color shot shows a small portion of the Carina Nebula, ""one of the largest seen star-birth regions in the galaxy,"" according to NASA. Former NASA astronaut John Grunsfeld, who flew on three service missions to Hubble, said that inside those newborn stars ""are the chemical elements ... that make up people."" Time.com: Greatest hits from Hubble . ""The carbon and oxygen in our bodies was all built inside of stars,"" he said, ""Hubble is answering fundamental scientific questions that in the end tell us about our earth, our solar system and ultimately how we were formed."" The photo, captured February 1 and 2, is one of more than 500,000 images that Hubble has taken -- captivating scientists and astronomy enthusiasts alike -- since it was launched into orbit by the space shuttle Discovery on April 24, 1990. ""I never would have believed in 1990 that the Hubble would have turned out this great,"" said Ed Weiler, associate administrator of NASA's Science Mission Directorate. ""I knew it was going to be great, but it has just exceeded all of our expectations."" Among its most famous findings, Hubble has: . -- Helped astronomers discover dark energy, which exerts a repulsive force that works against gravity; . -- Helped determine the age of the universe (about 13.75 billion years old); . -- Acted as a virtual time machine, providing glimpses into how the universe might have looked millions of years ago and helping shed light on how the giant galaxies we see today were formed; . -- Helped identify the atmospheric makeup of planets beyond our solar system. Weiler cites supermassive black holes, the largest type of black hole, as another of Hubble's most prominent discoveries. ""When Hubble was launched in 1990, supermassive black holes were a fantasy, a theory -- something you saw on 'Star Trek,'"" Weiler said. ""One of our goals was to ... find at least one and prove it exists. ""As it turns out, Hubble surprised us,"" he said, ""Not only did it find one but it basically showed us that supermassive black holes are pervasive throughout the universe ... and they clearly play a role in the evolution of a universe."" Despite its age, Hubble is 100 times more powerful today than at the time of its launch, NASA says, thanks to its most recent visit by astronauts, including Grunsfeld, on a service mission last May. ""We had hoped to get 10 to 15 years out of it with frequent shuttle visits every two and a half to three years,"" Weiler said. ""As it turns out, we're now 20 years into this program, and thanks to the work of John and the crew in the last mission, we're looking forward to at least another five years and maybe even another seven, eight or nine or 10 years more.""","New color photo of Carina Nebula marks Hubble Telescope's 20 years in space .

"(PopSci.com) -- As a species, we've hit the bedtime barrier. You can eat at your desk, socialize in the break room, and answer text messages on a date, but sooner or later, you're going to have to sleep. Your a.m. routine may involve downing a burst of liquid energy, boosting your performance for 22 hours at a stretch. ""After 18, 19 hours awake, your brain function starts to fail,"" says Dallas, Texas, sleep-medicine specialist Andrew O. Jamieson. Coffee might keep you up, ""but you're not going to be focused."" Coffee? You might as well be commuting by buggy. Old-school stimulants like caffeine, amphetamines and the drug Ritalin are about to be marginalized by eugeroics. This emerging breed of ""wakefulness"" pills promises to keep the workers of tomorrow not just awake, but alert, on-task and feeling fine through the night and well into the next day. Remember these names, because they're your future: Modafinil, approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 1998 for the treatment of narcolepsy and marketed in the U.S. as Provigil, is already giving a competitive edge to everyone from Air Force pilots on 40-hour missions to (less legally) college students cramming for exams. The drug's maker, Cephalon in Frazer, Pennsylvania, is awaiting FDA approval for armodafinil, which promises even longer periods of wakefulness on a single dose, and Irvine, California-based Cortex is working on its own drug, code-named CX717 and developed with funding from the military. The drugs are targeted at sleep disorders like narcolepsy, but it's their dramatic potential influence on the workplace that has researchers and efficiency experts buzzing. Scientists understand how the drugs work only broadly. Unlike traditional stimulants, eugeroics don't simply jazz up the whole body. Instead they tweak specific sleep-related mechanisms in the brain, so users don't feel jittery or wired, just alert. And in experiments with CX717, sleep-deprived rhesus monkeys on the drug often outperformed their own well-rested but undrugged best efforts on mental-performance tests. Modafinil, too, ""is definitely a cognitive enhancer,"" says cognitive psychopharmacologist Barbara Sahakian of the University of Cambridge. In her studies of alert human volunteers, the drug improved planning, concentration and impulse-control skills, and even boosted some forms of memory. Here's the rub: The drugs don't replace sleep, and decades of research show that sleep deprivation prompts immune dysfunction, depression and other disorders. Sleep isn't something we should be looking to phase out of our lives. Yet the economic pressure to stay out of bed is intense. Cutting out four hours of sleep a night would free up almost 1,500 extra hours a year. That's an additional nine months' worth of standard 40-hour workweeks -- plenty of time to earn a promotion or start your own company on the side (or, worst case, slog away in obscurity). From Napoleon to Edison to Churchill, many of history's most notable figures got by on only a few hours of sleep a night. Give an entire workforce the energy of a Thomas Edison, and you've got a new Industrial Revolution. For better or worse, when the trend takes hold, there will be no going back. Imagine sticking to double lattes while everyone else in the office -- or at the start-up down the road -- is juicing on the latest eugeroic, and you'll seem as naive and obsolete as the NFL linesman who swears by protein shakes alone. Any worker could benefit, says University of Virginia bioethicist Jonathan Moreno, author of the recent book Mind Wars. ""But for consultants or contractors, people who aren't on a salary?

"(CNN Student News) -- February 17, 2010 . Download PDF maps related to today's show: . • Afghanistan • Iran . Transcript . THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED. CARL AZUZ, CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR: This Wednesday, February 17th, CNN Student News begins with a big story out of southeast Asia. I'm Carl Azuz, reporting from the CNN Center in Atlanta! First Up: Taliban Leader Arrested . AZUZ: First up: What could be a major defeat for the Taliban. Pakistani officials say the Taliban's second-highest leader has been arrested. Details, right after some fast facts on the Taliban: This is a militant organization that used to control Afghanistan. It allowed the al Qaeda terrorist group to live and train there. A U.S. led coalition knocked the Taliban out of power in late 2001, after the September 11th attacks on America. Now, Pakistani intelligence says Taliban leader Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar was caught several days ago in Pakistan, which borders eastern Afghanistan. Baradar's capture could be a huge victory for the U.S. because America has been hunting him for years and he could have some incredibly valuable information about both the Taliban and al Qaeda terrorists. American officials are saying this could be a turning point in the war in Afghanistan. But there is a hitch: the Taliban deny that Baradar's been caught. They say he's still working for them and that reports of his arrest are designed to hurt the Taliban's morale. That is important to them right now because America, along with other coalition forces, are currently fighting the Taliban in southern Afghanistan. In the town of Marjah, a stronghold of the Taliban, U.S.-led forces are making progress. Marines took over a police headquarters there yesterday. New Nuclear Power Plant . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: We are announcing roughly $8 billion in loan guarantees to break ground on the first new nuclear plant in our country in three decades. AZUZ: And it would be an expansion of this nuclear facility in the eastern part of Georgia. The Obama administration claims the two, new nuclear reactors would create more than 3,000 construction jobs and 850 permanent jobs at the nuclear plant. The White House also says the power it would generate would be enough for more than half a million homes. Republican leaders, including both of Georgia's senators, like this idea. Sen. Saxby Chambliss says it's a step in the right direction, adding, the power generated by the Burke County Facility -- that's the one that's already there -- is safe, reliable, emissions-free and environmentally responsible. But some Democrats are against it, along with nuclear power critics. One of those, energy analyst Ben Schreiber, says, ""The last thing Americans want is another government bailout for a failing industry."" Schreiber went on to call nuclear power ""unsafe and dirty."" Iran's Warning . AZUZ: Iran's nuclear plan is worrying diplomats at the United Nations. And Iran's leader is warning the U.N. Security Council not to punish his Middle Eastern nation for its nuclear program. At a news conference yesterday, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said he wants the U.N. to ""move in the spirit of cooperation."" But if it doesn't, he says Iran would react in a way that would put the U.N. to shame. To the international community, those are very unwelcome words. The U.N. wants Iran to stop enriching uranium, because enriched uranium could help Iran make an illegal, nuclear weapon. Iran continues to argue its program would be used only to help provide power to civilians. The global community doesn't believe it. Cybersecurity . AZUZ: There are attacks going on in the U.S. that most people never hear about probably because most of the time, they fail. We're talking about cyber attacks. And many times, they come from other countries, testing our electronic systems -- they might target cell phone companies, power companies, Internet companies. Yesterday, a panel of former government workers got together in a cyber-attack drill to work on ways the U.S. could react to a large-scale, cyber attack. What they hope to get out of this are ideas: suggestions they could take to the Obama administration on how to improve the electronic systems that so many of us rely on day-to-day. Shoutout . TOMEKA JONES, CNN STUDENT NEWS: Today's Shoutout goes out to the students of Pikeville High School in Pikeville, Kentucky! Which of these rulers was known as ""the boy king""? You know what do to! Was it: A) King Henry VIII, B) Genghis Khan, C) Alexander the Great OR D) King Tut? You've got three seconds--GO! The ancient Egyptian King Tutankhamen is ""the boy king""; he took over at around age 10. That's your answer and that's your Shoutout! King Tut Findings . AZUZ: So we know he was young when he took over, that he died young in his late teens, and that King Tut ruled for about 10 years, starting in around 1336 B.C. But there is so much more we do not know, like how he died. Well, there's a new report out, based on King Tut's DNA. It's being published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association and it could fill in some blanks. The report suggests that the boy king died of complications from a broken leg along with malaria, a disease of flu-like symptoms carried by mosquitos. He also had a form of scoliosis and foot disease: health problems that researchers believe ran in his family. Hip-Hop Orchestra . AZUZ: Hip-hop and classical: Two musical genres that don't seem to go together. But the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra and hip-hop artist A. Leon Craft mixed it up recently. It's part of the orchestra's work to promote the arts in school curriculum as well as try something new and novel. Take a listen. Hear for yourself how it came together and how it sounded. (BEGIN VIDEO) UNIDENTIFIED MALE: The Atlanta Symphony Orchestra. ""808 BLAKE"" GERMAN, SMKA PRODUCTIONS: Classical music, it gets kind of the rap that it's, you know, old-timey and boring and that it's for an older generation. It's really the basis of how a lot of the music today is put together. The chance to work for a symphony to me is extraordinary. A. LEON CRAFT, RAPPER [RAPPING]: Use it to escape.... JERE FLINT, CONDUCTOR, ATLANTA SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA: Well, I think this is our first venture into hip-hop. By blending the two, I think that we reach really a kind of a broad expansive of audiences. We took basically a sampling of a piece. GERMAN: Gave me ""Hoe-Down"" by Copeland. I took the sample and I slowed it down, which kind of gave it this sort of feel right here. And I took it, chopped it up, and kind of looped it again, and then I added a second part right here. I usually start layering it with instrumentation, so, and the guitar kind of gives it that laid-back, just good-feeling vibe to it. As is with hip-hop, you know, you've got to have, this is the, that snap is what, the fact that it kind of gets you really bobbing your head. Kind of really feeling the music right there. What really drives it is this. Once we got the music together, then we brought in A. Leon Craft to do, to bring in and do the lyrics for us. CRAFT [RAPPING]: Music, yes, feel good, music. CRAFT: The hood goes, music is my life. GROUP [SINGING]: Music is my life. CRAFT [RAPPING]: The base clef and treble clef carries me away. CRAFT: I'm, like, I'm lost in the music. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE [SINGING]: On a beat like maestro. CRAFT [SINGING]: Music is my life. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE [SINGING]: It's with me everywhere. It's in my soul. CRAFT [RAPPING]: Music, yes, feel good music. So I got to make you feel good. CRAFT: I'm singing and rapping in front of the orchestra while, you know, the conductor is conducting the music, like, it's, wow. CRAFT [RAPPING]: Whether you appreciate my musical past. Everything in life has a rhythm, has emotion. Through emotion music will infinitely last. FLINT: It was just fascinating. A fascinating piece of work. Whether it's, whether it will last as a real art form or genre or just as an experiment, I can't tell. But it was fun to do it. UNIDENTIFIED MALE: It was very fun. I am, I'm a big fan of hip-hop. I like to dance a lot. UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Very fun. I really enjoyed it. CRAFT [RAPPING]: Oh how I love my music . CRAFT: Thank you so much. (END VIDEO) Promo .

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- An explosion at close range, and not a direct hit, caused the 1,200-ton patrol ship Cheonan to sink last month, a team of South Korean military and civilian investigators has tentatively concluded. The investigators' determination was reported Sunday by the Yonhap news agency. ""Instead of being directly hit by a torpedo or other underwater weapon, the Cheonan was affected by a strong explosion that occurred below its bottom at a close range,"" the news agency quoted a government official as saying. The explanation matches one that investigators offered shortly after the ship's stern was salvaged 10 days ago. A final result is not expected for a month, Defense Minister Kim Tae-young told reporters. He said that the most likely cause of the sinking was a ""bubble jet"" created by the external explosion under the ship. A bubble jet effect occurs when an explosion goes off under a ship. The change in pressure causes a huge column of water that strikes the ship with great impact. On Saturday, recovery crews found the body of a missing sailor in the wreckage of the ship. The ship sunk in the Yellow Sea near the western sea border with North Korea on March 26. Forty of Cheonan's 104 crew members have now been confirmed dead, and six more are also believed dead, though they are still listed as missing. Fifty eight others were rescued before the vessel sank. South Korea has not ruled out a theory that North Korea was involved. But Seoul has avoided directly blaming North Korea, which sloughed off allegations it is responsible. The families of the dead sailors began a five-day mourning period on Sunday. On Thursday, the South Korean navy will hold a funeral ceremony at a naval command in Pyeongtaek, about 70 kilometers (43 miles) south of Seoul. The navy has also decided to posthumously promote the dead seamen by one rank and award them a military honor for their patriotism.","Report: Close-range explosion caused S. Korean ship to sink .

"(CNN) -- Fernando Verdasco denied fellow Spaniard David Ferrer a third successive final appearance at the Barcelona Open after coming from behind to win a tense last-four clash on Saturday. Fifth seed Verdasco, the losing finalist last weekend in Monte Carlo, triumphed 6-7 (3-7) 7-5 6-1 to set up a title showdown with second seed Robin Soderling on Sunday. Verdasco was a break down as he trailed 4-3 in the second set, but battled back to win in more than two and half hours in the claycourt event. Ferrer had been hoping to make up for his past two final defeats against Rafael Nadal, who opted to rest this week after crushing Verdasco to win a record-equaling sixth title in Monte Carlo, but the eighth seed was soon 5-0 down in the decider. Verdasco is through to his third final this year, having won the SAP Open tournament in San Jose in February. The 26-year-old has won only once in five meetings with Soderling, who crushed young Dutchman Thiemo de Bakker 6-1 6-4 in Saturday's second semifinal. The Swede needed just one hour and 16 minutes to end the challenge of the 21-year-old, who fought back to make the scoreline respectable after trailing 4-0 in the second set. De Bakker, who has risen to a career-high 67th in the world rankings this month, upset third seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in the quarterfinals to follow up his earlier win over clay specialist and former world No. 1 Juan Carlos Ferrero.","Fernando Verdasco reaches second final in a week with victory at Barcelona Open .

"(CNN) -- Brazilian superstar Kaka celebrated his return from injury by scoring Real Madrid's winner against 10-man Zaragoza on Saturday night, keeping the pressure on Spanish leaders Barcelona. Kaka ended a six-week absence as he came off the bench in the second half and slotted home his eighth goal this season with eight minutes to play to give Real a 2-1 away win that left the capital club a point behind defending champions Barca. The midfielder, who cost $100 million when he signed from AC Milan in June, fired in a low effort across goalkeeper Roberto after running into the box to collect a precise pass from fellow big-money acquisition Cristiano Ronaldo. Ronaldo was also involved when Real, knowing they had to win after Barcelona's earlier 3-1 victory against bottom club Xerez, finally took the lead five minutes after halftime. The Portugal forward was quickest to react after Roberto could only first parry a low shot by Gonzalo Higuain and then block the former Manchester United star's own attempt, and veteran forward Raul was in the right place to sidefoot home the resulting cutback pass. Raul, who came on for injured Dutch midfielder Rafael van Der Vaart in the first half, also hit the post in the 26th minute. Zaragoza, just two points above the relegation zone, were reduced to 10 men only a minute after Raul's goal when Matteo Contini was sent off for aiming an elbow at Higuain -- the Argentine went down clutching his face even though the on-loan Italian defender's limb appeared to strike his chest. Raul also left the pitch with an injury, to be replaced by French forward Karim Benzema. But the home side, promoted back to the top flight this season, shocked Real by equalizing in the 61st minute as on-loan striker Adrian Colunga broke free on the counterattack and rounded goalkeeper Iker Casillas to slot the ball into the empty net. Sergio Ramos headed against the Zaragoza woodwork from Guti's free-kick as Real pressed for a winner, which came after the 75th-minute introduction of Kaka. Barcelona bounced back from the 3-1 midweek defeat against Inter Milan, which followed a long bus trip to northern Italy due to the volcanic ash cloud that closed Europe's airspace. Coach Josep Guardiola rotated his squad ahead of Wednesday's second leg of the Champions League semifinal, and Jeffren and Thierry Henry took advantage of their call-ups to put the Catalans 2-0 up inside 25 minutes. The 22-year-old winger Jeffren curled in a fine 14th-minute effort after linking with Xavi, while France forward Henry was set up by strike partner Zlatan Ibrahimovic. Xerez pulled one back just a minute later with a fierce shot from Mario Bermejo that caught Barca napping after a mistake by defender Dmitro Chygrynskiy, but Ibrahimovic restored the hosts' two-goal cushion 11 minutes as halftime after Ivory Coast midfielder Yaya Toure laid on an easy chance. Xerez ended the match with nine men as Matias Alustiza and Fabian Orellana were red-carded for bad tackles in the final minutes, and are now six points from safety with four matches to play. It was Xavi's 200th victory in 349 appearances in a Barcelona shirt, extending his club record. ""It was a dangerous game because however much you prepare tactically, your mind is on last Tuesday's match and the one we will play on Wednesday against Inter,"" Guardiola told reporters. ""Today we played thinking about Inter, and it was inevitable because it's just so important for us."" Valencia consolidated third place with a 1-0 victory at home to Deportivo La Coruna in the late match, with striker David Villa scoring the only goal from the penalty spot in the 34th minute after defender Ze Castro handled the ball. Los Che moved seven points clear of fourth-placed Mallorca, who host Malaga on Monday. The only blot on the night was the late sending-off of substitute Rubens Baraja, who received two quickfire yellow cards. The first spell also ended on a bizarre note as the referee blew for halftime before the required 45 minutes were played, and then had to restart the match after protests from both sides.","Real Madrid remain one point behind Spanish leaders after beating Zaragoza 2-1 .

"(CNN)  -- A 400-year-old minaret collapsed Friday on worshipers in Meknes, Morocco, killing 36 and injuring 71, the official news agency Maghreb Arabe Presse reported, citing the Interior Ministry. The collapse occurred as hundreds of people were gathering in Bab Berdieyinne mosque in Meknes, a town in northern Morocco located 140 km (87 miles) southeast of Rabat, it said. ""We were in the middle of prayers"" when the structure collapsed, said one victim told Morocco TV from his hospital bed. The incident occurred after several days of unrelenting rain, the television station reported. It broadcast video showing dozens of people inside the mosque carrying survivors out of the damaged structure to waiting ambulances. King Mohammed VI has ordered that the mosque be rebuilt as soon as possible and that its original architecture be preserved, it said.","Minaret in Meknes, Morocco, was 400 years old .

"Washington (CNN) -- Joel Sartore's photograph of gentle Bryn is a permanent record, but she has been lost forever. The Columbia Basin pygmy rabbit died in 2008 shortly after the picture was taken. She was the last of her kind. Sartore, who has worked for the National Geographic Society for two decades, called the brief shooting session with the doomed rabbit a ""solemn occasion,"" knowing she would not be around much longer. Bryn is one of dozens of animals profiled in a new book, ""Rare: Portraits of America's Endangered Species,"" by the award-winning photographer. See more portraits . Sartore, a Nebraska native, traveled the country to get glimpses of 69 species -- red wolves, Hawaiian orchids, hellbenders (a prehistoric-looking salamander), and sea turtles -- all now or once hanging on the verge of extinction. As the United States celebrated Earth Day on Thursday, Sartore talked with CNN recently about his passion for raising awareness about preserving the variety of animal and plant life before it is too late. CNN: This may be the only chance for most readers to see these beautiful, rare creatures. Joel Sartore: Whatever press these animals get is really minimal. Even some of the animals we call ""charismatic mega-fauna"" -- like whooping cranes, California condors -- they don't get enough press, so can you imagine the Pyne's ground-plum or the Mount Graham red squirrel -- what odds to they have to ever get even their 15 minutes of fame nationally? The goal is really to get people first aware of these always amazing plants and animals and to get them to care, before it's too late. A lot of the things that are going away are very small, little plants and invertebrates. CNN: This book expanded on a National Geographic magazine feature from several years ago. Why do an entire book? Sartore: I was always interested in endangered species, mainly why we let it happen. If we won't save our own plants and animals, how can we expect poorer nations to do that? So it's always been a bit of an outrage to me that we can let things disappear into extinction. CNN: You decided not to shoot your subjects in the wild, in their natural habitats. Instead you chose simple indoor backgrounds. Was that a practical or artistic consideration? Sartore: I needed to drive the point home that the small things are as important, if not more so, than the big things, and I figured by putting them on black and white backgrounds, it would make a rare butterfly as ""impactful"" as a polar bear. It is a great equalizer, and I tried to capture the intimacy and essence of each plant or animal. It's really hard to show something like an Iowa Pleistocene snail in a dramatic way when it's the size of a pencil lead and it lives in a kind of in a crack in a rock. If I shot in the wild, I would have had to pass on a lot of small creatures because I couldn't figure out a way to make the picture sexy enough. CNN: Does taking them out of their natural habitats remove some of the connection with the reader, that these animals exist in a larger wild environment? Sartore: That really wasn't a concern. I'm desperate to get somebody to care, right now. I have to make as dramatic a picture as I can. The American public cares a lot more about what's on TV and the price at the pump. That's sometimes all they care about, so my job is to get people to stop and think in any way I can that we're talking about a matter of life and death. There's such a disconnect now between humans and the natural world, and it gets worse every year. CNN: Many of these rare animals exist near human habitation, accessible to people who might want to seek them out. Sartore: That's true, but it's sad the disconnect from nature is so great that guys like me are having to turn the volume up any way we can on images to try to get people to care before all these species go away. We lost five birds in the turn of the last century, including the passenger pigeon. I'm seeing this acceleration I never thought would happen in my lifetime -- I thought I'd have a lot more time -- for literally thousands of species, and it's just very hard to get anybody excited about it, which stuns me. CNN: You shot an ocelot, a neotropical wildcat that ventures into extreme south Texas and Arizona. Sartore: It wouldn't stay still. It was trained to walk on a leash at the San Diego Zoo, and we got seven minutes with him before he got full. He'll stay in a certain area and not get antsy if you give him treats. The moment he fills up, he's done. For the grizzly bear, we painted an exhibit area white at the Sedgwick County Zoo in Wichita. That bear was pacing the whole time, so we took pictures of him as we could. Most of the time, the animals aren't happy about it, but this is the only chance they'll get to be seen and so the ends justify the means. Most of the time, it's a really quick process. CNN: What surprises readers most? Sartore: The one comment I get from people is: Wow, I had no idea that these things exist and that they're intricate, interesting and beautiful. And they didn't know they are on the edge of not existing. I'm hoping these pictures give a voice to the voiceless, that they allow some of these things that are living in forgotten marshes or some breeding facility that doesn't have enough funding, that they allow these species to be heard at least once before they go away. CNN.com: The American burying beetle is not well known, but nevertheless is important to the planet. Sartore: The St. Louis Zoo has a successful breeding program. That's an insect that was thought to go into extreme decline after the passenger pigeon went away because it's an animal that will actually bury the carcass of a dead bird or a rodent, and then create a nest chamber near it and then the parents shovel food back and forth to the young. So when billions of passenger pigeons were shot and disappeared, there went the carcasses, (and) the beetle was taken down with it. They've been rediscovered in a few states, but having undisturbed habitat is critical for this animal. CNN.com: Why should people care, and what can they do about it? Sartore: Many of the stories we tell are sad ones -- not all. There are many stories of hope -- the California condor, whooping crane, black-footed ferret, bald eagle, and the American alligator. So people can and have done good things. We can make great choices every day to help our planet. Every time we spend money we can help the planet, if we act responsibly. But if we don't turn things around, things are going to get very uncomfortable. My job is to make great pictures and get people to see what's going on. It's not hopeless, we can turn things around, but we have to first realize there's a problem. Hopelessness doesn't get us anywhere. It's just a matter of getting people to realize what's at stake. Most of these species are failing because their habitat is being chewed up. It's folly to think that as animals ourselves, we can let the rest of the world go to hell but we'll be just fine. We're all interconnected.","Joel Sartore's work appears in 'Rare: Portraits of America's Endangered Species'

"KABUL, Afghanistan (CNN) -- The death toll from Tuesday's fatal bomb blast in this country's northeast has increased to 75, Afghan officials said Friday. Afghan women weep over the coffins of victims from Tuesday's bomb blast. Zohur Afghan, a spokesman for Afghan Education Ministry, said that after a thorough investigation, officials determined that 59 schoolchildren and five teachers were killed and 93 children and three teachers were wounded. In addition, the blast killed six legislators and five of their bodyguards. It was the deadliest-ever suicide attack since the fall of the Taliban regime in late 2001. The victims were killed as they were visiting a sugar factory in northeastern Afghanistan's Baghlan province. The blast went off as schoolchildren lined the route where as many as 18 national lawmakers and dozens of local dignitaries walked on their way to visit a sugar plant as part of an economic assistance plan for the northeastern province. The ministry spokesman said the age of the students ranged from 8 to 17 years old. Afghan officials also said that the education minister has issued a ban on students assembling for such events in all schools around the country. Afghan President Hamid Karzai called the attack a ""heinous act of terrorism."" Among the lawmakers listed as dead was Mustafa Kazemi, the former commerce minister and spokesman for the opposition, who is also a top warlord in the region. Other lawmakers killed included Abdul Mateen, Alhaj Sahibur Rahman, Hajji Muhammad Aref Zarif and Sebghatullah Zaki, the statement said. E-mail to a friend .
