We may be living in dumbed-down Britain, but it would appear that, on the whole, we’re rather more cultured than some of our neighbours in Europe. We attend more operas than the Italians and visit more art galleries than the French, according to a study. The report says Britons are ahead of our neighbours on nine key cultural measures – debunking Europe’s view of us as a race addicted to reality TV and celebrity gossip. The report found Britons were more likely to visit art galleries than the French who claim to have the world's best collections . According to the Brussels-based Eurobarometer survey of 27,000 people from across the EU, we are far more likely to read a book, far more aware of history and far more keen to enjoy cultural events such as the ballet and the theatre than the average EU citizen. The land that gave the world Shakespeare has one of the largest theatre-going publics in Europe, with 39 per cent of Britons saying they had attended a play in the last 12 months – well above the EU average of 28 per cent. Almost two thirds – 65 per cent – of us have visited a historical monument or site over the last year. That compares with 54 per cent of French and 41 per cent of Italians. France has long prided itself as nation with the best art galleries. But only 37 per cent of French said they had visited a museum or gallery in the past year, compared to 52 per cent of Britons. You are more likely to find more empty auditorium seats in the home of opera, Italy, where only 17 per cent of natives said they had seen been to one in the last year compared to 22 per cent of Britons. We are also more likely to visit our opera houses such as the Royal Opera House in London (pictured) than Italians, while 80 per cent of us read a book last year . In austerity blighted Greece, visits to . historical monuments have collapsed to under half the EU average, with . domestic visitor numbers at such iconic sites as the Parthenon and . Acropolis in free-fall. The survey found 80 per cent of Britons had their noses in a book last year. That compares with the EU average of 68 per cent – but only just beats the Germans on 79 per cent. With both countries on the verge of political and economic collapse, only half the populations in Greece and Portugal have picked up a book over the last year. Overall, the survey shows that Britain bucks the European-wide decline in arts and literature ‘involvement’, which is down 24 per cent across the EU over the last five years due to the Eurozone crisis. But the UK has witnessed only a two per cent drop in the number attending or participating in cultural activities, the survey shows.","Britons visit more art galleries than the French, and attend more operas than Italians .

What started off as an innocent student tradition where upperclassmen men would present freshman women with a red rose and peck on the cheek at midnight has turned into something more debauched and, in some ways, dangerous. Full Moon on the Quad is a Stanford University tradition started in the late 1800s that went out of style for many years before being resurrected in the 1980s with the addition of binge drinking. On the first full moon on the school year, students get drunk and many dress up in costume or body paint to lock lips with as many people from midnight to 1am. This year it was held on October 22 instead of the full moon because of a conflict with homecoming. Welcome to college: On the first full moon of the school year, students at Stanford University participate in a 120-year-old tradition where freshman make out with upperclassmen on the quad . 'If you are single and want to make out with people, you just go up and kiss them,' senior Molly Vorwerck told ABC News. 'Usually they are people you know or know of - rarely a stranger. A lot of people are pretty tipsy and have a really good time.' Modern additions to this 'orgy of interclass kissing' (as it's been described in the New York Times) include a same-sex area and a bingo game where different kinds of students make up the different boxes: a pair of twins, a red head, someone who got a 2,400 on the SAT. The goal of the game is to get five in a row or all of the boxes for a blackout. The middle box is always the Stanford mascot - the Tree. This year's mascot, Calvin Studebaker, estimated that he kissed 566 people - a new record. 'Never kiss the Tree,' alumna Amanda Ach warned in the Times. 'He's like Patient Zero.' The number one issue for administrators is that the tradition occurs during flu season and that the mass exchange of saliva could spark an outbreak. Every year they attempt to educate the students on proper safety measures to ward off the cold or something worse like meningitis. 'We tell them, ""Don't floss beforehand, don't brush, don't do anything that could create microabrasions in your gums for germs to get in.""' said Michelle Lee Mederos, an educator who graduated in 2011. 'And we have tables where we offer mints and little Dixie cups of mouthwash.' Modern spin: Full Moon on the Quad has become much more debauched since being revamped in the late 1980s. This year's event happened on October 22 due to a conflict with homecoming. Students kissed outside the school's old student union building, right . But for Dr William Schaffner, professor and chair of preventative medicine at Vanderbilt University, the real problem is not the spread of disease. 'The . emphasis on permission and mutual consent is absolutely critical. The . actual health hazard is probably very, very small and would be difficult . to measure,' Dr Schaffner said. 'Certainly if we have impaired males, who tend to get more aggressive, and females tend to get more submissive or accommodating, that's where the issues come up with the drinking and morning after regrets. ' The school has only cancelled the event once - in 2009 when many East Coast schools were dealing with an outbreak of swine flu. The tradition continued on an unofficial basis. Francisca Gilmore was a freshman that year and attended the event. She says she's gotten strep throat twice from participating. 'The repercussions were brutal, and I wish I had done better on the Econ 1A final I took later. But I think in the long run, getting to tell people I've kissed over 50-plus people in a night is worth it,' she said.","Full Moon on the Quad started in the late 1800s when upperclassmen men would present freshman women with a red rose and peck on the cheek .

David Cameron is to lead a trade delegation to China, in signs of a thawing in relations with Britain. The Prime Minister says it wants to ‘forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries’ after causing a diplomatic row by meeting the exiled Tibetan spiritual leader, the Dalai Lama. The visit is considered so important Mr Cameron has demanded George Osborne delay his Autumn Statement on the economy for 24 hours. Speech: David Cameron used his speech at the Lord Mayor's Banquet to announce that he is to lead a new trade delegation to China . Mr Cameron’s trip comes after Mr Osborne and London Mayor Boris Johnson visited China last month. The Prime Minister had reportedly been effectively from visiting the Far Eastern superpower because of anger in Beijing over his decision to meet the Dalai Lama last year. The Chinese government always lobbies hard against ministers from foreign governments meeting the Dalai Lama, who is seeking a measure of self-rule for his homeland. Mr Cameron met the Daiai Lama last year, causing a rift with China . However, Mr Cameron used his speech to the Lord Mayor's banquet at the Guildhall to announce his trip in early December. He said: ‘As China’s new leadership sets its direction for the next ten years, as their country’s star continues to rise in the world, I will take senior British Ministers - as well as business leaders from every sector large and small - to forge a relationship that will benefit both our countries and bring real rewards for our peoples. ‘Opening the way for British companies to benefit from China’s vast and varied markets and preparing the way for a new level of Chinese investment into the UK. ‘This is a relationship that is for the long term, that matters for Britain and China, and which I look forward to continuing to strengthen in the months and years to come.’ In his visit last month, Mr Osborne . announced that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in a new . generation of nuclear power stations while visa restrictions would be . relaxed to encourage high-spending Chinese to come to London. In . his speech, Mr Cameron - who is leading trade visits to India and the . Gulf this week - said he hoped to encourage more investors from the Gulf . with a new electronic visa waiver system for short-term visitors from . Oman, Qatar, the United Arab Emirates, and Kuwait. Chancellor George Osborne visited China last month where he announced that Chinese firms would be allowed to invest in a new generation of nuclear power stations . He argued that the economic rise of countries such as China, India and Brazil should not be seen as a threat to the West, but as an opportunity for Britain to carve out a place alongside them in a more prosperous world. ‘As the number of university places surges in India, as China creates more patents than any other country in the world, and as Brazil becomes the world's first sustainable biofuels economy, people ask the question, will they be the winners and we be the losers? I believe we need to say a very firm “no”,’ he said. ‘The global economy is not a zero-sum game. If we make the wrong decisions, they may well succeed at our expense but there is a clear way forward for us to carve out a place for Britain to be a real success, alongside these new economic powers.’","Prime Minister to travel to Far East superpower in early December .

An Iraq war veteran who lost both his legs in an IED attack missed out on a $2,000 prize at his university's football game. Crowds of students at New Mexico State University were surprised when the winner of a cash prize was announced last Saturday, but failed to come forward. But, although friends texted Matthew Zajac to tell him of his good fortune, the double amputee says he wouldn't have been able to get to the game because he was caring for his elderly grandmother. Lost opportunity: Matthew Zajac missed out on the chance to claim a $2,000 prize . Although he admits it would have been nice to win the cash, Mr Zajac has remained upbeat, telling ABC News: 'I’m sure there are people that need it more than I do.' The cash prize was part of a university scheme to encourage more students to support their football team, the Aggies. But, to be in with a chance of winning, students had to be at the whole game when their name was drawn. 'There is no way I would’ve . been able to make it to the game anyway. I was taking care of my . grandmother, who is 87,' Mr Zajac, a mechanical engineering student, said. Veteran: Matthew Zajac served in Iraq with the U.S. Army .

'There’s always stuff to do around the house, and I got to make sure she . gets her medicine and that I get it to her on time,' he added. The 26-year-old student has been the main carer for his grandmother, Marjorie Seedorf, since his father died last year. The Iraq War veteran had his right leg amputated above the knee and left leg amputated below the knee after his Humvee hit an IED in Baghdad in May 2007. 'I do a little bit of walking, and I can usually muscle through it though,' Mr Zajac said. 'He cooks for me, he shops for me and he takes me to the doctor,' his grandmother told the Albuquerque Journal. 'I appreciate everything he does.'

A stranger has been allowed to get through airport security on another person's boarding pass after American Airlines issued him the wrong ticket. Brad Gertz was stunned when he went to Philadelphia International Airport to check into his flight for Chicago on Sunday to be told: 'You're already on the flight.' It turned out that staff had accidentally issued his boarding pass to another passenger who had then switched his flight to an earlier take-off time. The unidentified man managed to get through TSA security checkpoints despite having a different name on the boarding pass to his ID. The mistake was only spotted when he tried to board. Shocked: Brad Gertz was stunned to arrive at Philadelphia International Airport to be told that he was already on a plane bound for Chicago. He learned that the airline had mistakenly given someone his boarding pass . But American Airlines' systems failed to update and it still appeared as though Gertz was on the flight, alerting him to the mistake. Speaking to CBS2, Gertz said he was stunned to learn he was supposedly already onboard. 'I showed him my ID and said, ""I'm Brad Gertz, what's going on?""' he said. 'I can tell you, I lost all color in my face, I was nervous and furious.' He said that he immediately thought his identity had been stolen. 'God forbid this guy did something stupid. My name, my identity is attached,' he said. Demanding answers: Even though the mistake was caught before the stranger boarded the plane, the airline's systems failed to update. When Gertz tweeted them, they insisted he was in the air . Told he could not take his flight, he frantically tweeted American Airlines, who also told him that their systems showed he was already on a Chicago-bound plane. He eventually boarded a flight and arrived back in Chicago - but he still demanded answers. American Airlines admitted to CBS that a man was mistakenly given the boarding pass and made it past the TSA checkpoint but he was stopped before boarding. 'One of our employees realized the error after it happened and gave the other passenger the correct boarding pass,' the airline said in a statement. 'Because of this mistake, it appeared that Mr. Gertz was already checked in for and set to take an earlier flight. Mr. Gertz’s itinerary was not updated to reflect the mistake until he arrived at the airport later that morning to check in for his originally scheduled flight.' Scene: The mix-up took place at Philadelphia International Airport, pictured, on Sunday . But Gertz said the answer was not enough adding: 'This person, whoever this was, that got through under my identity that easy and made it to the gate? Who says anyone else can't? 'I was compromised/ I can't explain the . emotion that goes through you when American Airlines themselves tells . you you're on a flight.' The airline has offered Gertz a $300 voucher as a sign of goodwill, it said. But Gertz responded that the flight typically costs $600. TSA told WPVI that it is reviewing the incident to see how their mistakes occurred. 'Passengers are subject to a robust security system that employs multiple layers, including watch list matching, thorough screening at the checkpoint, Federal Air Marshals, armed pilots and a vigilant public, as well as many others, both seen and unseen,' the statement said.

The flood-prone village of Newtok near Alaska's storm-battered coast is running out of time as coastal erosion creeps ever closer to the Yup'ik Eskimo community. As residents wait for a new village to be built on higher ground nine miles away, a dispute over who is in charge has led to a rare intervention by the Bureau of Indian Affairs. The bureau ruled that the sitting tribal council no longer represents the community of 350 as far as the agency is concerned. Wooden boards connect houses in Newtok, Alaska - the flood-prone village near Alaska's storm-battered coast . Council leaders are appealing the BIA's decision, which gave the funding-administrative power to a new group that claims it is the rightfully elected council. Until the matter is resolved, millions of dollars in government funds for the relocation effort have been halted, as nature's relentless erosion continues, oblivious to who is in charge. 'Who's suffering here is the community members,' said Scott Ruby, director of the state agency that administers the relocation grants. Newtok is one of Alaska's most eroded coastal villages and the only one that has begun a physical move, with the raging Ninglick River steadily inching toward homes. Officials estimate Newtok, 480 miles west of Anchorage, has until the end of the decade before erosion causes severe damage. Government funds have been used over the last seven years to build six homes, a barge landing, roads and five storage structures at the site of the new village. Now those structures sit as reminders that a community's dreams of a rebirth are still unrealized. 'We're just falling way back,' said Stanley Tom, a longtime tribal administrator who is part of the group whose authority is no longer recognized. Bureau of Indian Affairs has ruled that the sitting tribal council no longer represents the community of 350 residents in Newtok, Alaska . In its ruling, the BIA said required elections were purportedly not held for more than seven years, so the old council had been operating on expired terms. The old council denies the allegations. The new council members were first elected in October 2012. The following month, members of the old council held another election. The resulting dispute reached a boiling point in June when the new council got more votes during a community meeting attended by both sides. That victory carried significant weight in the BIA's decision, which said its decision applies to such purposes as bureau funding. Members of the new council have not responded to requests from The Associated Press for comment. The state, which is not bound by the BIA decision, has been sitting on $6.5 million in reimbursable grant funds for the relocation effort, including proceeding with building out an evacuation center at the new location called Mertarvik. Any payout has been delayed by the dispute and failure of the new faction to establish an official bank account until recently. The state expects to soon issue $51,000 in revenue sharing funds to the new council that should have been distributed last summer. Relocations funds probably won't be disbursed until next spring at the earliest. Adding to the complication, recent audits by the state concluded that the old faction mismanaged the administration of other relocation grants, such as changing the architectural design of the evacuation center after it took over the project from the state in 2011. The audit also noted apparent payroll improprieties, including exorbitant compensation for certain employees. The audit recommends that the tribe return about $300,000 to the state for alleged improprieties including duplicate payments on invoices and retroactive wages for employees. Officials have denied any mismanagement. At the same time, members of the new council failed to hold a required election last month, saying they wanted to wait until the dispute was resolved, according to Ruby of the state Division of Commerce, Community and Economic Development. He would have liked to have seen an election held so that anyone who wanted to run, including members of the old faction, could have done so. He said the issue will have to be revisited later. For now, there is no time to waste, so the state is recognizing the new council, Ruby said. The Ninglick River is swallowing more and more bank each year just south of the village. Sinking permafrost continues to subject the area to flooding from intensifying storms blamed on climate change. 'There's a real need out there,' he said.","Millions of dollars in government funds for relocation have been halted because of a tribal dispute over who is in charge .

But when Sir Paul McCartney released his latest album, it was no match for The Thin White Duke’s chart-topping efforts. Instead, the former Beatle’s latest offering charted at number 18 in the UK iTunes chart yesterday, behind controversial singer Miley Cyrus, British singer songwriter James Blunt and pop band The Saturdays. Sir Paul has engaged in months of publicity to push the album, which was produced by Mark Ronson . Despite months of publicity and interviews from the veteran rocker, New, his first album to feature original songs since 2007, didn’t reach the top ten in the digital downloads chart – the biggest retailer of music. It is in stark contrast to fellow musician David Bowie, whose comeback album immediately peaked at number one in the iTunes chart within hours of its release in March this year. It was his first material in ten years and went on to top the charts in 60 countries around the world. Sir Paul, 71, has engaged in months of publicity to push the album, which was produced by Mark Ronson, known for his work with Amy Winehouse, Ethan Johns, the son of legendary Wings producer Glyn Johns, and Giles Martin, whose father is former Beatles producer Sir George Martin. McCartney (top left) posing for photographs with his former band, the Beatles . However, it appears as though the constant promotional work undertaken by McCartney has succeeded in one respect; a compilation album of Beatles Hits, 1, has re-entered the US  iTunes chart, and by last night had made it to number 69. Describing the album, the 16th of his solo career, McCartney has stated that the record was inspired by events including his marriage to Nancy Shevell as well as his early days as a musician before he found fame with the Beatles. The album has been widely praised by critics, one of whom described the title track as a ‘jaunty, Beatles-esque stomp’ and likening it to Beatles hit ‘Got to Get You Into My Life’. By this evening, the album had slipped to number 21 in the UK iTunes chart, but the position of albums and singles can change from hour to hour depending on sales. The Official Charts Company, which provides the charts based on the number of physical copies sold, will be announced on Sunday. Sir Paul’s last album, Kisses on the Bottom, featuring covers of classic pop songs, entered the UK charts at number 3 when it was released last year. His previous album, Memory Almost Full peaked at number 5 when it was released in 2007.","Sir Paul McCartney's latest album no match for David Bowie's comeback .

Howell was arrested in February over the rape of his then 25-year-old victim in a derelict yard near Manchester Victoria rail station on November 22, 1989. The woman was grabbed from behind as she left work between 6pm and 6.30pm and had a knife held to her throat. Howell, of Denshaw Close, Burnage, told a jury at Manchester Crown Court that consensual sex took place and that it was the woman who had initiated it. His account was rejected and he was found guilty of the rape. Police said no arrests were made at the time of the attack but the inquiry was never closed as detectives pursued numerous forensic leads. In 2004, Greater Manchester Police’s Cold Case Unit reviewed the case as part of Operation Advance, a nationwide review of unsolved rape cases using the latest DNA profiling techniques. As a result, officers obtained a full DNA profile of the offender from the original forensic samples taken but despite this breakthrough there were no matches on the national DNA database and Howell remained at large. Officers continued their search to expose this man and in 2012 they made the vital breakthrough. DNA lists of convicted offenders were examined and a familial link was established with the full DNA profile obtained in 2004, said police. This led officers to Howell who initially refused to provide a voluntary DNA sample when quizzed by police but finally gave one when police obtained a search warrant for his home. His sample proved a direct match as further inquiries revealed he was living and working in Manchester at the time of the attack. Mr Howell jumped out at his victim as she walked to her car in Red Bank, near Manchester city centre, above . Detective Constable Michaela Clinch, who led the investigation, said: 'After 24 years of living with the terrible memory of being raped, I am absolutely delighted that finally this brave woman has seen her attacker exposed and brought to justice. 'She suffered a terrifying ordeal at the hands of Howell that evening 24 years ago. She was brutally raped at knifepoint and I know it is an experience that left her emotionally scarred and traumatised. 'But she has shown tremendous courage, patience and tenacity and today finally she can take some comfort knowing Howell has been convicted of this awful crime. “This man hid for nearly a quarter of a century. When advances in DNA profiling led us to his door, he showed no remorse nor admitted his guilt, subjecting this woman to the further ordeal of giving evidence during a trial. 'But the DNA evidence itself was compelling and thankfully this rapist is now behind bars. 'Over the last 10 years in particular, advances in forensic technology have had a huge impact on the ability of the Cold Case Unit to investigate historic crimes. Landmark: Howell's victim had been walking close to Manchester Victoria train station, above, when she was attacked . 'As a result of these developments, we are able to revisit historic crimes such as this rape and find new evidence that will help us pursue a conviction. 'Investigations into rapes are never closed because at the heart of those cases are men and women who deserve to see justice done, no matter how long it takes. 'All cases remain open in the hope that further information will come to light and that is where we are today. 'This woman has had to wait many years to see Howell exposed for the criminal he is and I hope she feels some sense of closure. 'I also hope it sends a message to other men and women who were raped or sexually attacked decades ago that Greater Manchester Police will never rest until your attacker is caught and as technology continues to develop, so too do our abilities to relentlessly pursue these criminals.' In a statement issued by police, the woman said: 'What happened that evening has had an enormous and negative impact on not just my life but the lives of others, over the past 24 years. Manchester Crown Court heard Mr Howell put his hand around her mouth before dragging her on to wasteland . 'But I do not want to look back now, or pass any comment on Howell whatsoever. I want to move forward with my life and this process has brought me some sense of closure. 'What I would like to say is that if anyone else is in this situation, or has experienced what I have been through, I would encourage them to come forward and report it to the police. 'Times have changed and technology has developed so people do not have to suffer in silence or think that something that happened to them years ago can never be solved. It can. 'I also want to let people who have suffered a similar crime know that there is tremendous support now for victims. 'If you do come forward, you will receive a lot of support.

Obama's trip, his second to the continent as president, will take him to Senegal, South Africa and Tanzania. While the president hopes to spotlight trade and economic development themes, his visit would be dwarfed if Mandela's condition takes a turn for the worse. The 94-year old former South African president remained hospitalized in critical condition after being admitted more than two weeks ago with a lung infection, the government said on Tuesday. Air Force One carried Obama, his wife Michelle, their daughters Sasha and Malia, as well as the first lady's mother, Marian Robinson, and an Obama niece, Leslie Robinson. Africans feel a special bond with Obama, the first African American U.S. president, and have been impatient for him to make an extended visit to the continent. Africans are also disappointed that the Obama administration has not engaged with the continent as much as the administrations of George W. Bush and Bill Clinton.

Administration officials say the trip is an opportunity to jump-start the relationship. Obama's first stop will be Senegal, where he will visit Goree Island, the site of a monument to Africans who were sent to slavery in the Americas. His next stop will be in South Africa, where aides say he will be available to visit Mandela but will defer to the wishes of the Mandela family to determine whether the former South African leader is up to such an encounter.

Elsewhere, some have criticised Obama for the soaring cost of the tour, which could reportedly reach $100m. Some scoffed when a safari was vetoed after it was revealed the president would have required Secret Service agents to act as snipers in case of a wild animal attack. Further controversy surrounded Obama's decision to bring his mother-in-law Marian Robinson and her daughter and Obama's niece Leslie on the trip, which the White House Dossier says detractors have said makes it a 'de facto vacation'. The trip could be among the most expensive journeys a president has taken in recent memory, with price forecasts ranging between $60 million and $100 million. His recent appearances in Israel cost taxpayers an estimated $10.9 million. Trips on Air Force One cost the government about $180,000 per flight hour. The White House scotched a plan to include a Tanzanian safari on the agenda after a reporter revealed that a team of snipers with high-powered military assault rifles would accompany him in the wild. The Washington Post reported that the itinerary's dangers 'would have required the president’s special counterassault team to carry sniper rifles with high-caliber rounds that could neutralize cheetahs, lions or other animals if they became a threat.'

'My time in the US criminal justice system . made very real to me the huge inequality amongst Americans,' Ms Kerman said in a new interview with MailOnline. Scroll down for video . True story: Author Piper Kerman's memoir Orange is the New Black was turned into a Netflix series . 'Different . people are treated very differently in our courtrooms depending on their . income and, sometimes, the color of their skin.' Ms Kerman's very brief life of crime began shortly after graduating from Smith, when she smuggled a suitcase full of drug . money for her then-girlfriend, a high-end heroin importer. Her crime caught up to her a few years later, and she was sentenced to 15 months behind bars, which was reduced for good behavior. 'I think that I had to discover and rely on my . best self to survive the prison system,' Ms Kerman said. After wondering if she would 'be pegged the snotty rich bitch' after seeing 'very West Side story' dorms with names . like  'The Suburbs', 'The Ghetto' and 'Spanish Harlem', she quickly figured out that her best chance of survival was learning to fit in. 'The lessons I learned that . stick with me I gleaned from the women I did time with, not from the . correctional system, which teaches people how to be prisoners . and little else,' she says. New series: Actress Taylor Schilling's character Piper Chapman in the Netflix series is based on Ms Kerman's real-life experiences . She says that it was the sense of community that made her time behind bars bearable. Small . acts of kindness, like a fellow prisoner buying her a root beer float . when she couldn't access her commissary account, take on seismic . importance. While most prisoners do not have a high school . education, Kerman had a degree, access to good lawyers and a fiance who wrote New York Times editorials about her plight. 'Was I going to be pegged the snotty rich bitch? My time in the US criminal justice system . made very real to me the huge inequality amongst Americans . 'I was mercifully not subjected to prison healthcare,' she says, adding . Netflix . scene in which a . woman is strapped to a bed and forced to take anti-psychotic medication . isn't that far removed from reality. 'I believe that prisoners who do not want . to take medication can be forced to comply with prison healthcare . orders.' She also got an up close and personal look at the cycle of addiction, and understand the role her crime played in the drug trade that affected so many of their lives. Despite the differences, Ms Kerman began to discover how closely their lives were linked - and could tell their story in a relatable way. Love lost:  Laura Prepon (left) plays Piper's ex-girlfriend who introduced her to the drug trade . Show creator Jenji Kohan has said: 'You know, you're not gonna go into a network and say, ""I want to talk . about black women and Latina women and old women in prison."" You need a way in. She was our gateway drug.' 'I believe that prisoners who do not want . to take medication can be forced to comply with prison healthcare . orders' The show also depicts the lighter moments and sometimes-bizarre prison routines. Some used prescription medicines and cigarettes to pass the time; Ms Kerman took up Dominos. To battle boredom she also gossiped, . read, microwaved 'prison cheesecake' from stolen butter, got prison . pedicures from a fellow inmate, and discovered feminine hygiene products . could be to MacGyver everything from mops to makeshift dildos. Behind . bars: The characters Ms Kerman met during her 15-month stint behind . bars are fleshed out much more fully in the Netflix series . 'We mainly used them as cleaning implements,' she admitted. 'I was impressed with the show's use of them in costuming.' She still thinks about her time in prison - and the women she spent time with - every day and stays in touch with many of them. 'I have been in touch with the friends I made in prison, some for many . years, and some have been in touch since the book published or the show . aired,' she says. 'I am very grateful for these friendships.' Since her release, Ms Kerman has . become an advocate for prison reform through work with organizations . including the Women's Prison Organization. She admits that she was lucky: A friend created a job for her in his company. Most women, she says,don't have that option. 'The biggest obstacle for people coming home to live a legal life . is getting a job; so employment programs that teach real . skills and connect people to opportunity on the outside would make a . huge difference,' she explains. 'However, it would be most effective to invest in . education and employment opportunity earlier, so we don’t spend huge . sums on prisons and jails in the first place.' She's also gone from threatening to drown her ex-girlfriend in a toilet to forgiving her - and forgiving herself. She wrote: 'If I could forgive myself, I could prove that I was a strong, good person who could take responsibility for the path that I had chosen for myself, and all the consequences of that action.'","At 23, Piper Kerman smuggled a suitcase full of drug money for her girlfriend, a high-end heroin importer .

Poor sleep may be linked to Alzheimer's disease in older adults, according to a new brain imaging study. The findings follow earlier research indicating that one of the functions of sleep is to purge the brain of toxic proteins. One such harmful protein is beta-amyloid (Abeta), which accumulates in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Poor sleep may be linked to Alzheimer's disease in older adults, according to a new brain imaging study . The new study appears to reinforce the importance of sleep in staving off dementia. U.S. scientists who looked at data on 70 adults with an average age of 76 found that those who slept less, and who experienced low quality sleep, had higher levels of beta-amyloid. Self-reported sleep duration in the participants ranged from five to seven hours a night. The authors, led by Dr Adam Spira, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, wrote in the journal JAMA Neurology: ‘In summary, our findings in a sample of community-dwelling older adults indicate that reports of shorter sleep duration and poorer sleep quality are associated with a greater N`beta burden. ‘As evidence of this association accumulates, intervention trials will be needed to determine whether optimising sleep can prevent or slow AD (Alzheimer's disease) progression.’ The researchers pointed out that the study did not indicate whether sleep disturbance preceded beta-amyloid build-up. The findings follow earlier research indicating that one of the functions of sleep is to purge the brain of toxic proteins . Nor were they able to assume that poor sleep causes Alzheimer's. But other research published in the journal Science last week points to the importance of sleep in clearing toxic proteins such as beta-amyloid from the brain. A system that flushes toxic waste out of the brain was found to be 10 times more active during sleep. Scientists believe the brain has to take a break from mental processing while the clean-out is under way.","Harmful proteins accumulate in the brains of sleep deprived people .

Terri Sproul’s claim that she had been assaulted as she walked home from a party led police to spend 147 hours trawling CCTV footage while forensic teams carried out a finger-tip search of Coventry city centre. But her lies unravelled when officers found a message on her Facebook page to a man she had consensual sex with on the night of the alleged rape. The 19-year-old posted the comment: ‘Oi Oi sexy how are you? Listen if the police phone you I got out of the taxi on my own. Don't say you came to mine.’ She pretended she had been attacked by an unknown other man.

Katie Simpson, prosecuting, told the court: ‘When they [the police] spoke to her about the Facebook messages she became very emotional. ‘She started crying and admitted to the police that she had lied to them. ‘She said she had never been raped and when they asked her why she had lied she said simply because she wanted to seek help.’ Giveaway: Sproul's Facebook page, on which she told a man she had sex with before she claimed she was raped by a random attacker: 'Oi Oi sexy how are you?

'Totally unacceptable': Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said it was 'clear' that actions taken Serco staff needed to be investigated by police . A private security company faces a police investigation after the Government uncovered potentially fraudulent behaviour in its multimillion pound prison escorting contract. Serco employees allegedly recorded prisoners as having been delivered ready for court when in fact they were not, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. The figures are a key performance measure for the £285million contract. The contract, which covers prison transfer services in London and East Anglia, has been put under administrative supervision with immediate effect. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling said: 'It’s become very clear there has been a culture within parts of Serco that has been totally unacceptable, and actions which need to be investigated by the police. 'We have not seen evidence of systemic malpractice up to board level, but we have been clear with the company - unless it undertakes a rapid process of major change, and becomes completely open with Government about the work it is doing for us, then it will not win public contracts in future. 'The taxpayer must know that their money is being properly used.' Both the MoJ and Serco’s directors have asked City of London police to investigate the actions of the staff working on the prison escorting contract. The Government department said differences between Serco’s records of contract performance and the actual situation on the ground has been subject to investigation for some months. A Serco security van: Serco employees allegedly recorded prisoners as having been delivered ready for court when they were not. The figures are a key performance measure for a £285million contract . Evidence of potentially fraudulent . behaviour emerged as part of the audit work announced by Mr Grayling in . July in the wake of an electronic tagging scandal, in which G4S and . Serco were both accused of overcharging the Government for monitoring . offenders. The time at which . prisoners are made available for legal visits, prior to being delivered . to the courtroom dock, is a key measure of Serco’s performance on the . contract, the MoJ said. The latest investigation into Serco comes in the wake of allegations that taxpayers were charged tens of millions of pounds for ‘phantom’ electronic tags on criminals who were either dead, in jail or had left the country. The private security firm and its industry rival G4S are both accused of wrongly billing for tens of thousands of tags which had either been removed or simply never fitted. Estimates suggest up to one in six of the 18,000 tags the Ministry of Justice was billed for every day were not real. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling in July took the dramatic step after pledging to recover ‘every last penny’ owed to the public purse as he asked fraud investigators to prove the scandal. He told MPs the scandal could date back as far as 1999, when tagging of criminals began in England and Wales. Since then the taxpayer has spent £1billion on tagging and monitoring offenders. The current contracts began in 2005. Mr Grayling at the time condemned the overcharging as ‘wholly indefensible and unacceptable’. In some cases, bills were paid for months or years after tags were taken off, he said. The process of getting a prisoner from the prison van to the point where they are ready for legal visits can be lengthy, as they have to go through comprehensive security checks and processing. The audit findings suggest some Serco staff have been manipulating their performance figures. In light of the new findings, Serco have agreed to repay all past profits made on the prison escorting contract and to forgo any future profits. The FTSE 100 giant has told the MoJ that no member of the board had knowledge of the allegedly fraudulent practice. The annual contract value is £40.7 million, with the current projected contract value over seven years at £285 million. Chris Hyman, chief executive of Serco Group, said: 'The Justice Secretary is right to expect the highest standards of performance from Serco. 'I am deeply saddened and appalled at the misreporting of data by a small number of employees on the contract. 'This is a very serious matter for the customer and for us. We will not tolerate any wrongdoing and that is why we have referred this matter to the police. 'It is also why I have immediately initiated a programme of change and corporate renewal. 'The overwhelming majority of our people work hard every day to deliver important public services and will share my deep concern about this matter.' Juliet Lyon, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said: 'Everyone wants to see proper rehabilitation but, if the 'rehabilitation revolution' means handing shed loads of money to apparently untrustworthy private companies, it will be a disaster for the taxpayer and for the criminal justice system. 'It's not too late for the Ministry of Justice to deliver rehabilitation reform by driving up standards and building on best practice in probation, prison and voluntary services.'","Serco allegedly falsely recorded prisoners as delivered ready for court .

Bestseller: One of the two Margaret Thatcher miniature Toby Jugs on sale in Parliament's shops . Margaret Thatcher regularly tops polls of Britain’s greatest Prime Ministers. But it can be revealed that the three-times election winner is also leading the field in a unique popularity contest – to be Parliament’s best-selling Toby Jug. The Iron Lady’s china miniature is head and shoulders above the competition, well ahead of other PMs including Winston Churchill, David Cameron and Tony Blair. The caricatures of every prime minister since Neville Chamberlain are on sale to MPs, peers and visitors for an eye-watering £30.50. The figures are understood to be popular among politicians wanting an unusual tribute to their political hero, or heroine. Each jug stands at around four inches tall, and has a hole in the 'head' should the owner wish to use it for a small drink. According to figures obtained by MailOnline, in the last three some 90 Margaret Thatcher mugs have been sold, ahead of Winston Churchill’s 81. Lady Thatcher has consistently been the bestseller, even before her death in April. In the last year she told 40 mugs, compared to 50 the year before. She has proved so popular the House of Commons now stocks two different models, the only Prime Minister given such an honour. Lady Thatcher now accounts for one in four of all sales of the miniatures in the two souvenir shops on the parliamentary estate. The bizarre barometer of parliamentary popularity reveals the two great Prime Ministers leave the rest of the field trailing. Some 71 people have bought David Cameron’s likeness since August 2010, according to figures obtained under freedom of information laws. Line-up: How the Toby Jugs appear in the Commons shop. Back row (l-r): Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, David Cameron, Edward Heath, Margaret Thatcher. Middle Row: Winston Churchill, Alec Douglas-Home, Margaret Thatcher, John Major. Front row: Clement Attlee, Harold MacMillan, Anthony Eden, James Callaghan, Neville Chamberlain . Popularity contest: How the sales stack up from August 2010 to August 2013, according to the House of Commons . Long-serving premiers or those who won several elections seem to fare better at the tills. In the battle for New Labour supremacy a slightly maniacal-looking Tony Blair . trumps Gordon Brown by 31 to just 19. Even John Major, who secured a surprise election victory in 1992 before leading the Tories to their worst election result in modern times, is proving more . popular than Mr Brown with sales of 30 in the last three years. Likeness: In the last three years the David Cameron jug has been bought by 71 people, well ahead of Tony Blair's 31 sales . Unsurprisingly the lower profile PMs . from Britain’s past sell appear to sell less well, with only four people . choosing to display a model of Anthony Eden on their mantelpiece. However, the most-lowly figure is Alex Douglas-Home, Prime Minister from 1963-4. In the last three years not a single Toby Jug of him has been sold, the House of Commons said. An opinion poll carried out after Lady Thatcher's death in April saw her named as Britain's most popular PM since World War Two. In all 28 per cent named her 'the greatest' in the YouGov/Sun survey, beating Churchill into second on 24 per cent. Tony Blair was third on 10 per cent, but David Cameron scored zero.","90 Margaret Thatcher miniatures sold to MPs and peers since 2010 .

It may be almost seven decades since the Germans last flew them during World War II and used them in a series of devastating bombing raids on London, Coventry and Norwich. But German bombers will be filling the skies above some of the world's most famous landmarks again - with the help of a new app aimed at promoting the RAF Museum's latest exhibit. Using a specially developed Augmented Reality App, called Apparition: Dornier Do 17, a full scale, 3D vision of the aircraft can be placed in various locations around the globe. Under seige: Dornier Do17 bombers will be flying above London seven decades after the Second World War as a new app developed by the RAF Museum brings history back to life . Bringing history to life: The app, designed to celebrate the museum's latest exhibit, will be available from October 16 . The new app has been developed thanks to a £75,000 grant from Wargaming which has allowed the museum to work with redLoop . design and innovation centre to develop a new way of bringing history back to life. Available from October 16, visitors to the museum, and a number of other museums across Europe will be able to hold up their smartphones and see computer generated versions of the 'flying pencil' aircraft flying above the scene in front of them. The app has been developed following the retrieval of the last surviving . Dornier Do 17 from the Goodwin Sands off the coast of Kent back in June - the . biggest recovery of its kind in British waters. Royal Air Force Museum Director General, Peter Dye: 'This heralds a new era of exhibition display and what Museums can achieve. New exhibit: The new app has been developed thanks to a £75,000 grant from Wargaming . 'For the first time ever the same 3D exhibit is visible in defined physical sites around the world.' The Dornier aircraft recovered from Kent waters in June was first spotted by divers in 2008, lying 50ft below the surface on a chalk bed, surrounded by debris. Sonar scans carried out by the RAF . Museum, Wessex Archaeology and the Port of London Authority confirmed . that the plane is the Dornier Do 17Z Werke number 1160, which was shot . down during the Battle of Britain. Two . of its four-man crew were killed as it crashed into the sea, but the . other two were captured and taken into custody as prisoners of war. The badly-damaged aircraft was transported more than 200 miles in June from Ramsgate, Kent, to RAF Cosford in Shropshire after spending seven decades at the bottom of the English Channel. Since its arrival on June 15, thousands of visitors have viewed the Dornier and additional viewing panels have been installed to allow visitors to see more of the aircraft. The plan to raise the plane - three years in the making - involved attaching lifting equipment to the strongest parts of the aircraft's frame and raising it whole in a single lift on June 10. Judging by the serial number on the aircraft it was shot down on August 26, 1940, at the height of the Battle of Britain. It was nicknamed the Luftwaffe's 'flying pencil' because of its narrow fuselage. Around 1,500 models of the aircraft were built, but this is the last remaining. Originally it would have been camouflaged green and dark green on top with swastikas outlined in white on both rudders. Relic: A Dornier 17 German bomber aircraft which crashed into the sea during World War Two is raised by a salvage crew off the coast of Deal, Kent, in June . Historical: The remains of the plane are currently being restored and will go on display at the RAF Museum . The Dornier's bombs devastated large areas of London, Coventry and Norwich as one of the Luftwaffe's most important assets in the early phase of the Second World War. Historians believe this particular plane took off on the morning of August 26, with eight other Dornier bombers from St Trond in German-occupied Belgium to bomb the RAF fighter base Manston in Kent. The Luftwaffe lost three of its Dorniers that day, including this one. After an attempted controlled landing, the plane somersaulted and landed on its back. Wireless operator Helmut Reinhardt and Bomb Aimer Heinz Huhn died and their bodies were washed up in Holland and England respectively, where they were buried in war cemeteries. Sunk: A sonar image released by the Port of London Authority showing the wreck of the Dornier Do 17 bomber lying on the Goodwin Sands before it was raised . The other two crew members, Pilot Willi Effmert and Bomb Aimer Hermann Ritzel survived and spent the rest of the war in British prisoner-of-war camps. Experts have been excited by the find because, apart from the effects of sea life - such as barnacles, coral and marine life, it is largely intact. Amazingly the main undercarriage tyres remained inflated, although the propellers clearly showed the damage inflicted during the bomber's fateful final landing. The Dornier Do 17 was known as the 'flying pencil', because of its unusually narrow fuselage. It was one of the main bombers used by the Luftwaffe during the Second World War, including at the Battle of Britain in 1940. The plane was developed to be a commercial aircraft, but was turned down by Lufthansa and redesigned into a bomber. In action: A Dornier bomber similar to the one which crashed into the sea during the Battle of Britain . Although the Do 17 was no longer made after 1940, it was used by Nazi forces throughout the war. More than 400 of them were flown in the Battle of Britain, with 171 shot down by the RAF or otherwise lost. The planes were 52ft long with a wingspan of 59ft, and could carry 2,000lb of explosives while manned by a crew of four. None of the aircraft were believed to have survived for long after the end of the conflict, until the discovery of the plane off the coast of Kent.","A new app developed for the RAF Museum will see German bombers take to the air again .

David Cameron is quietly sounding out Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny about becoming the next President of the European Union in a bid to boost his hopes of renegotiating Britain’s relationship with Brussels. Downing Street officials are seeking a candidate who can stop Socialist Martin Schulz, the German left-winger who is currently President of the European Parliament and is backed by Labour. Senior sources say Britain wants to block Mr Schulz ‘at all costs’ since his taste for more regulation on business would scupper efforts to make Europe more competitive. Bid: Cameron, left, is quietly sounding out Irish Prime Minister Enda Kenny, right, about becoming the next President of the European Union in a bid to boost his hopes of renegotiating Britain's relationship with Brussels . The plotting came as Mr Cameron admitted that support for British membership of the EU is ‘wafer thin’ - something his aides fear could disappear if Mr Schulz replaces current Commission President Jose Manuel Barroso next year. Mr Schulz first came to public attention in 2003 when former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi compared him to a concentration camp guard. A confirmed EU federalist, he has previously demanded that the European Parliament sets EU budgets and repeatedly demands more money for Brussels - an attitude that would undermine Mr Cameron’s efforts to secure a new deal with the EU. One insider told the Mail that picking Mr Schulz would be like returning to the centralising days of former Commission President Jacques Delors, a bitter opponent of British attempts to reclaim powers from Brussels. Search: Downing Street officials are seeking a candidate who can stop German Socialist Martin Schulz, pictured, who is currently President of the European Parliament and is backed by Labour . Government sources in Dublin revealed that Mr Cameron’s officials have been in touch about whether Prime Minister Kenny fancies the job. ‘One of the people pushing this name out there is the man in Downing Street,’ a source told the Belfast Telegraph. ‘We have been getting questions from people in that building. [Cameron] has a high regard for [Kenny]. They would feel he would be sensitive to their sensitivities on Europe.’ One government source in London denied that Mr Cameron has settled on Mr Kenny as his chosen candidate but said: ‘The question is: how do you stop Schulz from winning? In terms of making Europe more competitive, more flexible and if you want to stop tying businesses up in red tape, he is not the man.’ The Prime Minister told business leaders that he was determined to secure a ‘yes’ vote in a promised in/out referendum on EU membership in 2017. Warning: Boris Johnson said that Cameron needed to change Britain's relationship with the EU . But he told the CBI annual conference: ‘It is my judgment that our current consent of remaining inside the EU is wafer-thin - we have not made the argument enough about why Europe matters. ‘The British people were told about a Common market, about an economic area. So much has changed about this organisation and so little consent has been granted. ‘Let us reform this organisation, let’s make changes to how it works and put those changes to the British people in a referendum.’ London Mayor Boris Johnson yesterday unveiled a shopping list of changes to our relationship with the EU that he wants to see David Cameron come back from Brussels with. And he warned that unless the Prime Minister is successful, the British people would vote to come out of the EU in 2017. He told the BBC: ‘We need a totally new approach. The Prime Minister will find loads of allies around Europe if he says do we need all this employment law, do we need all this funny agricultural stuff, do we need a common fisheries policy? ‘Can’t we get rid of so many of these pointless intrusions by the European Union machine into the running of national life? ‘It’s unbelievable that in 2013, 60 or 70 years after the European movement as launched, we’re still having a system of agricultural subsidy - a support mechanism in which taxpayers pay subsidies to farmers in order to maintain the price of food. ‘I think that’s absolutely crazy in a globalised economy, it’s an anomaly, it’s an anachronism, we should get rid of it.’ He added: ‘I happen to think David Cameron has a massive chance now. He’s greatly respected among leaders and he could say to his colleagues around the table that in the end, unless you give me what I need, I’m afraid the British people are going to vote against. ‘They don’t want that, believe me - they want us in.’","Downing Street officials are seeking candidate who can stop Martin Schulz .

An off-duty undercover New York City police detective who witnessed a violent confrontation between an SUV driver and a group of bikers last week but failed to report it has been suspended as two of the alleged attackers turned themselves in. Reginald Chance, 38, who police say is the biker seen in a video smashing his helmet against Alexian Lien’s SUV and yanking him out of the vehicle, came forward Friday night along with 35-year-old Robert Sims. Sims, of Brooklyn, has been charged with attempted assault, gang assault and criminal possession of a weapon. The 35-year-old biking enthusiast has been identified as the person seen trying to open Lien's door, according to the New York Daily News. In custody: Reginald Chance, 38 (pictured left and right) surrendered himself to police in connection to the Sunday attack on an SUV driver . Meanwhile, NYPD spokesman John McCarthy confirmed Saturday that the unnamed detective believed to be an off-duty narcotics officer and member of a biker club was stripped of his gun and badge pending the outcome of an internal affairs investigation why it took the agent four days to come forward. He was riding with the Frontline Soldiers biker club, according to the New York Post. The papers aid the club also counts several others among its members. McCarthy said internal affairs was also trying to determine investigating whether any other officers were present during the Sunday altercation and didn't immediately report it. It has been reported this week that at . least five off-duty cops witnessed the beating of Lien, who was driving an SUV on the Henry Hudson Parkway last Sunday . with his family inside. The incident left Lien needing stitches and motorcyclist Edwin Mieses Jr possibly paralyzed. Among the officers reportedly riding in the biker rally were at least two detectives and three other officers who did little to stop the attack. One of the detectives, the undercover narcotics agent, watched as the . violence broke out and chose not to break it up for fear of ruining his . cover. Undercover officers are required to immediately report being a witness to a crime. Uniformed officers are required to take police action if they see a crime occurring, but the rules are murkier for undercover officers who face blowing their cover, confusing civilians who don't realize the undercover is really a cop and ruining yearslong investigations. Before and after: Edwin Mieses Jr suffered a broken spine, fractured ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve and now may never walk again . The five officers were not the only ones present, WABC . is reporting that the NYPD is investigating whether several off-duty . corrections officers were also there. Police who saw the violent attack . did not begin coming forward until Wednesday - four days later. It is believed that the 38-year-old biker who was . seen on the video smashing his helmet into the Range Rover's window is . expected to turn himself in to police for his role in the melee, according to WABC. It is not clear what further role, if any, he played in the fracas. Investigators have already questioned some of the six individuals seen in the YouTube video of the assault, according to WABC. They plan to talk to as many as possible, the station noted. 'This is a complex investigation with a lot of people involved,' a source told WABC. One of the bikers who spoke to investigators said that Mr Lien 'drove erratically and bumped the bike on the side,' adding 'when he bumped that bike on the side, that bike became aggressive because his life was in danger,' according to WABC. The New York Post originally reported that the first undercover officer to admit being at the ruthless pounding was not the only cop at the scene, as several members of the motorcycle group- called the Front Line Soldiers- are police officers themselves. Internal Affairs of the NYPD are now investigating whether or not any of these officers were the ones who were pictured hitting the Range Rover, though they do not seem to be worried that the undercover took part . When reached by MailOnline for comment, an NYPD spokesperson said only that the involvement of off-duty officers 'is under investigation.' 'It is does not appear that he got involved at the scene,' a police source told The Post. That said, the undercover officer has hired a lawyer. On camera: This shows the moment the Range Rover driver panicked and hit some of the bikers as he tried to get away to protect his wife and child. It is believed he hit Jeremiah Mieses here . Smashed: When they come to a standstill in heavy traffic, it takes moments before a biker jumps off and attacks the vehicle, smashing the driver's window with his helmet . He was not the only one to do so, as longtime partner of Edwin Mieses Jr, the man who was run over by the car, has hired famed defender Gloria Allred. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia said at a Friday press conference. 'To learn that he almost died and that he may not walk again- that is all still sinking in. 'It tears me up that anyone could think that Edwin in anyway deserves what happened to him.' Mieses was one of dozens of bikers who rode alongside a black Range Rover on Manhattan's West Side Highway last weekend until a biker slowed down and the vehicles bumped, police said. Video captured at the scene shows the SUV surrounded by helmeted riders. Damage: The broken window on the passenger side of the vehicle shows that the male driver was not the only target of the bikers' wrath . Scary: The Liens said they feared for their lives . Towed away: The car was brought to the NYPD's 33 precinct on Friday . In the video, one rider approaches the vehicle and peers into the driver's side window. Police said others tried to damage the SUV before the driver, Alexian Lien, took off and plowed over Mieses. The . bikers then chased after Lien and smashed his car window with their . helmets, then pulled him from the SUV and beat him to the point where he . required stitches. Lien's wife, Rosalyn Ng, has said that . her family's sympathies go out to Mieses, but that they had to flee a . dangerous situation. 'He is the best father I know,' Dayana Mejia, Mieses' longtime partner, said at a Friday press conference . Support: Ms Mejia, seen with attorney Gloria Allred and Mieses' father Edwin Mieses Sr, said that they are still coping with how to deal with Edwin's injuries . She said her husband was trying to protect her and their 2-year-old child, who was also in the car at the time. Mieses, . who is from Lawrence, Massachusetts, suffered a broken spine, fractured . ribs, a punctured lung and a torn aortic valve, said his attorney, . Allred. His injuries may have left him paralyzed. Pain: Ms Mejia said that it is wrong to cast any of the blame of the incident on her partner . 'He told everyone to move on and go back to riding, and turned his back to the SUV to start walking back to his own bike,' Allred said. 'It was then, with his back to the SUV, and as he was in front of it, that he was run over and crushed.' Mejia said a difficult situation has been made worse by what she described as a 'perception' that some people have about the riders who participated in the rally on Sunday. 'They are not gang members. They are not thugs,' Mejia said. 'They are FedEx drivers, plumbers, military reservists, musicians. They are fathers and brothers and sons, and sisters and mothers.' She also said Mieses didn't know any of the people he was riding with on Sunday aside from one friend who traveled to New York with him. Mieses was recently arrested in Andover, Mass., for driving with a revoked license. He also never applied for a motorcycle license. Records show that in June he was named a habitual offender and his right to drive in the state was revoked until 2017. It wasn't clear if he had been licensed in any other state. Fears: Lien needed stitches after he was attacked by bikers in New York on Sunday as he tried to protect his wife and child. He hit some bikers in a bid to escape them but they caught up and beat him . Mieses and the others seen on the video were participating in a periodic rally in which more than 1,000 bikers head for Times Square, police said. The Manhattan district attorney's office has charged one rider, 28-year-old Christopher Cruz, of Passaic, N.J., with unlawful imprisonment and reckless driving while authorities continue to search for other cyclists. Investigators and prosecutors are tracking down and talking to dozens of helmet-clad motorcyclists seen in the video, which was posted online.","Reginald Chance, 38, and Robert Sims, 35, turned themselves in Friday .

"By . Hugo Gye . PUBLISHED: . 03:22 EST, 12 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:38 EST, 12 November 2013 . A group of five state grammar schools are planning a huge increase in pupil numbers despite a Government ban on new grammar schools, it has emerged. The King Edward VI Foundation, a group of five prestigious schools in Birmingham, plans to admit 130 more students at its five schools from next September. The foundation wants to recruit more pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds to counter claims that grammar schools mostly benefit the well-off. Boost: King Edward VI School Handsworth is one of five Birmingham grammar schools which is set to increase pupil numbers from next year . In addition, it will increase funding for two independent schools it controls by £3million in order to expand the range of subsidies and scholarships on offer for poorer students, the  Independent said. The five Birmingham schools which come under the King Edward VI umbrella are Aston, Camp Hill school for Boys, Camp Hill School for Girls, Five Ways and Handsworth. News that more grammar school places are being made available will please advocates of selective education, who are frustrated that no new grammars have opened for decades thanks to a Government ban. Only 164 state-run grammar schools remain in England concentrated in certain areas such as Kent, Essex and Lincolnshire. A few areas retain a formal grammar school system, using the 11 Plus exam to select the most able pupils. These include Trafford and Buckinghamshire. Supporters argue that selective state education promotes social mobility by providing chances for talented children whose parents cannot afford private school fees. However, opponents such as teaching unions claim that grammar schools mostly benefit the well-off who are able to coach their children for the 11-plus exam. A report released last week by the Sutton Trust, a leading educational charity, found that children who went to private prep schools were four times more likely to pass the 11-plus than pupils who qualify for free school meals. Accessible: The schools, including Birmingham's Camp Hill School for boys, pictured, are aiming to recruit from all areas of society . The King Edward VI Foundation insists it will concentrate on recruiting from poorer areas to prevent the schools from becoming the preserve of the rich. John Collins, secretary to the foundation's governors, told the newspaper: 'We are increasing admission to our five free grammar schools for 2014 under the existing selection criteria but we aim to implement changes that will make all of our schools more accessible from 2015. 'The foundation wants to ensure that all parents and schools with naturally gifted and talented children are aware of the opportunities.' Although the moratorium on selective schools has prevented the establishment of any more grammar schools, the number of grammar school pupils rose by 32,000 between 1997 and 2007 as each school took on more students. In Kent, local councillors have approved the construction of a new 'satellite' grammar school sponsored by an existing institution. The debate over grammar schools was stoked over the weekend when Sir John Major attacked the dominance of privately educated people at the top of the society, prompting new calls for the reinstatement of selective state schools.","Five prestigious schools in Birmingham will accept 130 more pupils .

Changes: Planes like these landing at Gatwick Airport will be banned from landing or taking off after 11pm from 2017 . The noisiest planes at Britain’s biggest airports will have to take off and land half an hour earlier under an extended night-time flying ban, the Government has revealed. In future they will be stopped from flying in and out of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted airports after 11pm, 30 minutes before the current deadline. The noisiest planes are already banned between 11.30pm and 7am at large airports and these current night flying rules will remain in place until October 2017. Ministers say it is ‘sensible’ not to make major changes before the Government-appointed Airports Commission to report in Summer 2015 with its plans for future expansion. ‘As noise impacts are a key consideration for the commission, we agree that it would not be sensible to make any significant changes to the current regime before the commission has completed its work and the government has had time to consider its recommendations,' Aviation minister Robert Goodwill said. ‘We therefore propose to set a three year regime to last until October 2017 which will retain the main features of the current regime, in particular the numbers of movements and noise quota permitted.’ The details were published in a second consultation into night-flying, which revealed 'some minor changes will be made to restrict the noisiest aircraft. Dangerous: Certain studies have revealed the negative impact plane noise can have on the health of households under flight paths . Named and shamed: Last week Heathrow revealed their first ever league table of airline noise based on summer readings, with Poland's LOT and Israel's El Al the worst offenders . 'We are proposing to extend the . operational ban on the noisiest types of aircraft to include the 11pm to . 11.30pm  period. Such aircraft are already banned in the rest of the . night period (11.30pm to 7am),' it says. ’Whilst there are few such movements, this change would prevent sleep disturbance caused by movements of these noisier aircraft types at this time. ‘These proposals will maintain the current level of protection for local communities, provide stability until decisions have been made about any new airport capacity.’ Ministers have also encouraged trials of planes making steeper descents into airports to reduce the noise ‘footprint’ and therefore the number of households affected. But the report stresses: ’The Government has been restricting night flights for many years at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted in order to limit the impact of night noise on local residents.’ Labour’s Shadow Aviation Minister Gordon Marsden MP said: ’I welcome the Government’s proposals not to increase the number of night time flights at these airports. ‘We believe this issue is one that the Airport Commission will want to take proper account of in both its interim and final reports. But Government must not become complacent about this issue. Instead they must carefully monitor the situation and respond to the concerns coming out of local communities while prioritising future strategies to control noise.’","Latest landing or take-off will now be 11pm instead of 11.30pm .

Tiny urns containing the remains of babies cremated two-and-a-half millenia ago have been discovered in a mass grave in Poland. Archaeologists made the discovery as they excavated a cemetery in the Polish village . of Łęgowo near Wągrowiec and found the remains of thousands of settlers buried in 150 graves, or 'pit tombs.' These tombs were common during the late Bronze Age, when members of . Lusatian culture across Eastern Europe were cremated upon death and . buried together in urns, with some ashes being offered as . gifts to the gods. During the late Bronze Age, members of the Lusatian culture were cremated. Family members would then bury the urns with clay gifts. In one grave, archaeologists found a tiny urn next to an early baby's rattle in the shape of a pillow made from clay and filled with small balls, pictured . During the late Bronze Age Lusatian culture flourished across Eastern Europe. Lusatian culture spread from Poland, into the Czech Republic and Slovakia as well as parts of East Germany. The dead were cremated and . buried in their thousands together - with some being offered as gifts to the . gods. The ashes were placed in urns and were understood as vessels that took the deceased on their ‘last journey’. Family members would decorate these urns with elaborate . patterns, or bury their loved ones with various clay gifts to send them . on their way to the gods. These urns were understood as ‘vessels’ that took the deceased on their ‘last journey’, claimed lead archaeologist Marcin Krzepkowski. When one person died, their ashes were stored in an urn and placed in a designated 'pit tomb' within a cemetery. As more people died, the urns were grouped together until the tomb was full. It would then be covered over and the urns would be buried. If members of the same family died before the tomb was covered over, they would be added to the same tomb. Families would also choose tombs, in a similar way funeral plots are allocated today. This means the child graves discovered by Krzepkowski could have been surrounded by the parents and relatives of the child, or put in a mass grave with others from the same community. Krzepkowski added family members would decorate urns with elaborate patterns, or bury their loved ones with various clay gifts - such as the rattle that was found - to send them on their way to the gods. Many of the elaborate urns were decorated with images that depicted the Lusatian way of life, including horse riding and agriculture. The people of the Lusatian culture were believed to be mainly cattle, pig and goat farmers. Among the remains discovered in Łęgowo, Krzepkowski also found bronze items including pins and a sickle, plus what appeared to be an early razor. Urns were classed as 'vessels' that took the deceased on their 'last journey'. Traditional burials were rare in the Lusatian culture and almost all settlers would have been cremated. The ashes were placed in urns covered with a bowl lid. Dozens of urns would then be buried together in the same location, pictured . A number of the urns discovered in Legowo featured bird symbols, or had connotations with birds. This piece of pottery was buried with an urn as a 'gift to the gods' and is a jug for poring water. The handle is shaped like a duck . Krzepkowski told the MailOnline: 'The dead bodies were burnt at the stake. After that, any remaining bones were carefully collected and put into the urn . covered by bigger bowls, often in an anatomical arrangement.' This meant legs and feet were put in first, ribs in the centre and the skull would be placed on top. Not all cremations lasted long enough to turn the entire body to ash. Jewellery, sickles and . small axes were then added after the cremation and Krzepkowski said researchers know this because the tools and jewellery usually show no . signs of fire or burning. One pit tomb discovered in Legowo contained bones of a number of people, which Krzepkowski believes all belonged to one family - as was tradition. Sometimes . human bones were even mixed with animal bones. Some tombs contained urns . and small pieces of pottery and Krzepkowski said he plans to test these small pots to see if they contained milk, water or alcohol given as a 'gift'. In one grave, Krzepkowski found a tiny urn next to an early baby’s rattle in the shape of a pillow made from clay and filled with small balls. Traditional burials were rare in the Lusatian culture and almost all the settlers would have been cremated. Krzepkowski told MailOnline: 'In Bronze Age the custom of burning the dead people spread over most of Europe, including the current territory of Poland. 'From this period, and from the . early Iron Age, we know of many cemeteries contained hundreds or even thousands of pit tomb.' He added the custom was more than likely due to people during this period having 'solar beliefs' and  worshipping the sun. The ashes were usually placed in urns and these were covered with a bowl lid before being turned upside down.Dozens of urns would then be placed in the ground in the same locations to create ‘grave pits.’ During Krzepkowski’s excavations he found one pit contained as many as 40 urns filled with ashes, plus various gifts. In another grave containing the remains of what appeared to be a child, Krzepkowski discovered a spoon with a handle shaped like a bird. While a third contained a decorated bowl with a small bird-like figure inside. Some family members would decorate the urns with elaborate patterns, as seen on this vessel discovered in Legowo, pictured. Many were decorated with images that depicted the Lusatian way of life, including horse riding and agriculture . One pit tomb discovered in Legowo, pictured, contained bones of a number of people, which lead research Marcin Krzepkowski believes may have all belonged to one family - as was traditional at that time . ‘A quite unique discovery in this part of the Poland is a small rectangular clay object, associated with the cult of hearth and home, so-called moon idol,’ explained Krzepkowski. He continued that such objects are usually found in Silesian cemeteries, mostly from the area of Wrocław around 136 miles south of Legowo. The Lusatian culture spread from Poland, into the Czech Republic and Slovakia as well as parts of East Germany during the late Bronze Age and early Iron Age. In 1933 Polish archaeologists discovered remains of a Bronze Age settlement in Wielkopolska (Greater Poland) which later became known as Biskupin and was among the first excavations of a Lusatian culture settlement. Another was found in Buch near Berlin. Records written by Polish priest Jan Dlugosz in the fifteenth century were the first to mention the cemetery found near Wagrowiec. The site location was then pinpointed, pictured, to the village of Legowo in the 19th Century . Both sites contained open villages with fortified settlements made up of wooden boxes filled with soil or stones. The forts were built on top of hills, or in swamps, and cemeteries were created nearby. It is believed that the graves found in swampy areas were full of ‘gifts to the gods’ – a place where settlers who had been sacrificed would be placed. What is believed to be sacrificial pits found in Bradenburg in Germany were found to contain human bones buried as deep at five metres. According to researchers, the dead bodies were burnt at the stake. After that, bones were carefully collected and put into urns, pictured, covered by bigger bowls, often in an anatomical arrangement. This meant the feet and legs went in first and the skull sat on top . Records written by Polish priest Jan Długosz in the fifteenth century were the first to mention the cemetery found near Wagrowiec. According to Science and Scholarship in Poland, the notes said: ‘born from the womb of the earth are pots, by themselves, only by the art of nature, without any human helping, of all sorts of different shapes, similar to those people use, though delicate and soft, while still rooted in their family soil in the ground, yet when they are removed they become tight and hardened in the sun or wind.’ The site location was then pinpointed to the village of Legowo in the 19th Century. The work was carried out by the Regional Museum in Wągrowiec.","More than 150 graves were found in a cemetery in Legowo, near Wagrowiec .

'I was hospitalised on a number of . occasions. I was threatened that I’d be destroyed, . killed, taken out if I contacted the police.' Panchenkova, who has four children with Chigirinsky, said that on one occasion she woke to find him trying to suffocate her with a pillow, the New York Post reported. She said that the following day he told his lawyer that he wanted to kill his wife, 'but didn't know how to dispose of the body'.

He said his choices include hacking the software that analyses the fingerprint data, or physically opening up the phone and connecting it to a custom-built device that would impersonate Apple's fingerprint reader.

Gordon Ramsay’s contract to run the restaurant at Claridge’s hotel is not being renewed, it has been revealed. His 12-year stewardship of the Art Deco dining rooms at the five-star Mayfair hotel will end in June after talks aimed at reaching a new agreement broke down. The notoriously fiery chef is understood to have withdrawn from negotiations after becoming annoyed at the length of time it was taking to finalise a new deal. He has run the restaurant since 2001 when he clinched the deal with his former business partner and estranged father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson. Gordon Ramsay's time at Claridge's is coming to an end after a breakdown in talks about long-term contract renewal . The restaurant was rated second in London for 'most disappointing cooking' and fourth for 'most overpriced restaurant' in the Harden's restaurant guide . However, the five-star hotel's dining . rooms lost their Michelin status in January 2010 a year after head chef . Mark Sargeant, one of his most promising cordon bleu stars, quit. After losing the coveted accolade, Ramsay said: 'We are very disappointed to lose the Michelin star, but we are going to work harder than ever to try to earn it back.' The restaurant was later rated second in London for 'most disappointing cooking' and fourth for 'most overpriced restaurant' in the Harden's restaurant guide. The Kitchen Nightmares star - known for his fiery temper - suggested the failure to retain its high ranking might be the result of a desire to offer more simple, cheaper, dishes to appeal to diners in the recession. But there was concern among diners that he might have failed to give the venture enough of his time - as he was appearing on TV shows and opening overseas restaurants at the same time. Soon after Mark Sargeant (pictured with Ramsay) quit as head chef, the restaurant lost its Michelin rating . 2008: Gordon Ramsay's Michelin-starred La Noisette at London’s Jumeirah Carlton Tower Hotel closed after less than two years in business. Industry sources said La Noisette, run by former Greenhouse chef Bjorn van der Horst, had struggled and was particularly quiet at lunchtimes. It suffered a string of poor reviews, many of which concentrated on the brown decor and low ceilings. His contract to run the restaurant at London’s Connaught Hotel also ended in September of the same year. 2009: Ramsay admitted his business had teetered on the brink of administration. He sold his flagship restaurant on Hollywood’s legendary Sunset Strip less than a year after its glittering opening. Business had become so slow that on some days staff outnumbered customers. He also sold his restaurant in Prague – Maze at the Hilton in Prague’s Old Town – back to the hotel. 2010: Maze by Gordon Ramsay, in South Africa, closes after one year. 2011: Ends partnership with Verre in Hilton Dubai Creek; Maze and Maze Grill closes in Melbourne, Australia. 2012: Maze in Qatar closes after two years; Ramsay is ditched by his flagship restaurant in Canada - Laurier Gordon Ramsay in Montreal - after just six months. It is understood Ramsay finally . withdrew from Claridge's after the hotel was apparently unable to decide on a new contract due to a shareholder dispute. A spokeswoman for Gordon Ramsay . Holdings said: 'We have taken the decision to close Gordon Ramsay at . Claridge's in June 2013 following a fantastic collaboration over the . last 12 years. 'We would . like to thank all our guests for the amazing support they have given for . over a decade, but felt the time was right to move on to new . opportunities and investments.' Thomas Kochs, general manager at Claridge's, said yesterday: 'We thank Gordon and his team for the incredible dedication they have shown in making the restaurant such a success. 'We feel the time has come, however, for a new dining direction for Claridge's and we bid farewell to Gordon with best wishes.' In 2012 it was reported that Gordon Ramsay would face competition from his estranged father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson. Mr Hutcheson and his son Adam were . said to be launching a chain of healthy fast-food restaurants called . Scoffs, serving British tapas for diet-conscious office workers. Hutcheson . and Adam, who used to be head of pubs at Ramsay’s restaurant group, . expects the chain to grow to 20 to 30 restaurants within 18 months. His adviser David Rawlinson said: . 'Chris and Adam have an incredible wealth of experience in catering and . plan to roll out the concept.' Hutcheson . was dismissed in October 2010 after Kitchen Nightmares star Ramsay . accused him of hacking into private emails and plundering £1.4million . from his restaurant empire to finance his serial womanising. Claridge's general manager Thomas Kochs said Ramsay's team had been dedicated to making the restaurant a success . Ramsay had run the restaurant at Claridge's since 2001 when he clinched the deal with his former business partner and estranged father-in-law, Chris Hutcheson (both pictured) Ramsay also claimed that Hutcheson put his wife and son on the payroll and wrote five-figure cheques to himself. Hutcheson, who denied the claims, branded Ramsay a fame-obsessed 'monster' and sued him for unfair dismissal and unpaid wages. Their . feud was settled after Ramsay, married to Hutcheson’s daughter Tana, . reportedly paid £2million in February last year to buy his father-in-law’s 30 per . cent stake in the business. After his rise to fame, it has been a difficult few years for TV chef Gordon Ramsay. He reportedly paid his father-in-law £2million to end a long-running row over his business in 2012. The pair went their separate way after Ramsay accused Chris Hutcheson of taking money out of parent company Gordon Ramsay Holdings (GRH). He was even seen in an awkward QVC pitch, as he tried to sell the 'Nonstick Hard Anodized Dishwasher Safe 10-piece Cookware Set'. Ramsay's fiscal . situation hasn't been as healthy as it once was in the last few years, . after he paid off a a tax debt in 2009 relating to his Plane Food . restaurant at Heathrow’s Terminal 5. Gordon Ramsay sold his restaurant in Prague - Maze at the Hilton in Prague's Old Town - back to the hotel in 2009 . Also in 2009, he sold his restaurant in Prague – Maze at the Hilton in Prague’s Old Town – back to the hotel. The father-of-four closed two eateries in Australia in 2011, waving goodbye to Maze and Maze Grill in Melbourne’s Crown Metropol Hotel. Further troubles include a £1.1million court battle in New Zealand after pulling out of a number of charity engagements, citing personal reasons . Even wife Tana tried to help pocket some cash after agreeing to star on the fifth series of British Dancing On Ice, but soap star Hayley Tamaddon triumphed as the winner. Ramsay’s rise to fame led from restaurant kitchens to Hollywood. He began with Restaurant Gordon Ramsay, which won three coveted Michelin stars in 2001. Then his empire expanded quickly, with Amaryllis in Glasgow, Gordon Ramsay at Claridge’s, and eateries in Dubai, Tokyo and New York. From Royal Doulton to Kmart, from Argos to the QVC shopping channel, you are never far away from Gordon Ramsay-branded products. All this helped Gordon Ramsay Holdings to a turnover of £4.8 million in 2011, although expenses and bad debts lead to heavy losses.  In that year he also opened a new restaurant in London.  In 2012 he opened four new restaurants in the US. In 2008, the News of the World published . stories claiming Sarah Symonds, now 43, and Gordon Ramsay had had a . clandestine affair for seven years.

This was the spectacular sight of the Crystal Palace transmitter lighting up the sky last night to commemorate it broadcasting its last analogue signal after 56 years. The 719ft-high tower shone like a beacon over south London as it marked the end of an era following the biggest digital switchover yet. The mother of all transmitters, which reaches a fifth of the country's TV sets all by itself, will continue to broadcast signals - but only digital ones from now on. The 219m tall Crystal Palace broadcast tower is illuminated to mark the switch from analogue to digital television, bringing to an the end the 75 years that the antenna has been broadcasting the analogue signal. Digital and analogue transmissions both . use radio waves, except that the former encrypts the signals so that . only digital receivers can light up our homes with entertainment. Broadcasting its first TV signal in 1956, the 719ft-high Crystal Palace transmitter has been nicknamed ‘South London’s Eiffel Tower’. And, despite being in rather less exclusive area than the Paris icon and strictly off-limits to tourists, Crystal Palace has possibly a greater importance than its 1,063ft rival.. Without it a fifth of Britons would have no TV. There are 1,153 other television transmitters reaching 62 million people, from the Outer Hebrides to Bodmin Moor. But Crystal Palace is the largest and most important. It was from here that colour television first took flight in 1967, from here that HD television was transmitted for the first time in 2009. The tower was built on the ruins of the original Crystal Palace, the Victorian exhibition centre which burned down in 1936. The first transmission took place on March 28, 1956. It was initially only used experimentally, with the BBC’s main transmitter at Alexandra Palace. The only terrestrial station in the pre-digital era that is didn’t transmit was Channel 5. But now, using coded UHF signals, it can transmit every digital channel. Nevertheless, the end of analogue at Crystal Palace, which first transmitted a signal in 1956, marks an important step in our history as modern technology replaces old. It would be particularly pertinent to the 100,000 homes were left with no television service at all in the switchover because they only had an analogue set. Second . and third sets which were not digitally connected will also have gone . blank in households throughout London and the Home Counties. People will now need to use services such as Freeview, satellite and cable to carry on watching on these sets. Although there has been a major publicity campaign, there were thousands of calls to the national helpline yesterday. When . the signal to BBC2 was cut in the capital and surrounding areas earlier . this month, there were about 35,000 calls to the body in charge of the . process, Digital UK. Yesterday in the second part of the London switch, BBC1, ITV1, Channel 4 and Channel 5 lost their analogue signal. An . estimated 12million sets were involved in the switch which took place . overnight. Freeview viewers were also required to retune their set-top . boxes and sets. Some viewers took to Twitter to admit their confusion, while others complained that the retuning had not worked. One said: ‘Why have I lost BBC1 and BBC2 from Freeview? I thought it was analogue that was getting switched off.’ Turning the airwaves blue: The transmitter tower is lit up as part of last night's celebrations . Millions of viewers also lost access to Ceefax, the world’s first teletext service. This week’s move marks the largest . phase of the switchover with not only London but parts of Essex, Kent, .

The guests recalled their greatest ever TV moments with Sir David recalling the 'moment a man walked down a ladder and stepping on to the moon' and Professor Brian Cox treasuring the Apollo 13 splashdown. Amongst the celebrity guests, former BBC director general Greg Dyke shared his precious TV moment of Geoff Hurst's goal in the 1966 World Cup and his favourite comedy, The Likely Lads. He said: 'This is a momentous moment in terms of choice of TV. We are all guilty of forgetting the range and quality of television we have in this country and it's all got a lot better with the digital switchover.' Former Playschool presenter Floella Benjamin recalled the time her stage show in the West End was halted because tennis legend Arthur Ashe was on the brink of beating Jimmy Connors and the show stopped so they could watch the historic moment.

Cecilia Samieri, who examined data on . almost 11,000 women, said: ‘Those with healthier dietary patterns at . mid-life were 40 per cent more likely to survive to the age of 70 and . over.’ They were also more likely to be ‘healthy agers’ with no problems in physical functioning, mental health or thinking skills. Time to make a lifestyle change? A new study has found women on a Mediterranean diet are 40% more likely to live past 70 . A Mediterranean diet is thought to . improve heart health and help stave off cancer as it is high in fruit, . vegetables, fish, nuts, whole grains and ‘healthy’ fats, and low in red . meat and dairy products. Dr Samieri and a team from Brigham and . Women’s Hospital and the Harvard School of Public Health, in Boston, . used data from a major study that began in 1976. They followed 10,670 US . women in their late fifties and early sixties who had no chronic . diseases in the mid-1980s. The women were given scores from 0 . (least healthy) to 110 (healthiest) based on how closely their diets . matched a general healthy eating index, and scores from 0 to 9 based on . how ‘Mediterranean’ their diet was. Back to basics: A typical Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, fish, chicken and olive oil but is low in red meats and saturated fat . The team followed them to see how they aged up to 2000. In all, 1,171 women, or 11 per cent, were healthy agers, the Annals Of Internal Medicine reports. Healthy agers had an average general diet score of 53.2, compared to 50.6 among usual agers. On the Mediterranean diet scale, they scored 4.5 on average, compared to 4.3 for usual agers. Healthy agers were also less likely to be obese or smoke and they exercised more in mid-life. Dr Samieri said there was no reason to believe similar results would not be found in men. Dietitian Joan Salge Blake said: ‘It’s never too late to improve on your diet and lifestyle.’","Study evaluated the diet and medical records of more than 10,000 women .

A survey found almost one in five of those still employed have had to change the way they work as a result, with one in 10 curbing their hours. One in 10 osteoarthritis sufferers aged 55 and over say it has affected their work, with two thirds quitting. Around eight million people have osteoarthritis, which affects the joints, particularly the knees. Osteoarthritis researcher Professor Philip Conaghan, from the University of Leeds, said: ‘One of the key issues that this survey highlights is the massive negative impact of osteoarthritis on people in work. ‘With a rapidly ageing population and financial imperatives for us to stay in the work force longer, the consequences will include much more personal anguish and even greater economic burden on society. ‘We need to understand the osteoarthritis treatment strategies that will maintain people in their jobs.’ In the poll of 700 sufferers aged 55 and over, one third had to give up a sport or hobby they really enjoyed.

A bulletproof Rolls-Royce Sliver Shadow used by Princess Diana on her first trip to the U.S. is expected to fetch more than £1.2million at auction. The Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow was bought new in 1979 by the British embassy. But it didn't come into service until 1982 after engineers spent three years and $200,000 armouring the luxury car to repel bullets, grenades and even small bombs. The silver limousine was used by the UK embassy in Washington and was the car which transported Princess Diana and Prince Charles on their state trip in November 1985. Under the hammer: The Rolls Royce that carried Prince Charles and Princess Diana during their 1985 U.S. visit is to be auctioned. It is expected to reach £1million . Bulletproof: The armoured Rolls Royce carries the couple on their state visit to the US in 1985. It had $200,000 of work before being allowed for use by the royals . Charles and Diana are pictured arriving at a function in the Rolls Royce during their 1985 visit to Washington and the United States . During the trip, the Royals were frequently seen in the Rolls-Royce as they visited US President Ronald Regan and his wife Nancy. The Royal engagement also saw Princess Diana, then 24, dance with John Travolta at a gala at the White House. During the trip there were a number of anti-British IRA supporters protesting against the couple - with security as important as ever. But they were well protected by the Rolls-Royce which was fitted with a 600lb windscreen and equally hefty rear window. The side windows, which are also bulletproof, were sealed against possible toxic gas exposure, and the exterior trim was fitted with intercoms. Protected: The windscreen of the vehicle was fitted with a 600lb windscreen and rear window, while the side ones could protect against poison gas . Bright: The car was kitted out in ruby red leather and carpets. The exterior trim also had an intercom system . The car is going to be auctioned off on eBay by the Volo Auto Museum near Chicago on November 9 - exactly 27 years after Diana's visit. Brian Grams, Volo Auto Museum director, said: 'We just thought it was an armour-plated Rolls Royce that had been embassy-owned. 'But after digging through the documents and doing some research, we figured out what the car really was.' Documents show in excess of $200,000 was spent armouring the Rolls-Royce, known as a Silver Wraith II in the US, with experts valuing it at $2million (£1.25m).

Other cars featured in the auction include Jon Bon Jovi's personal BMW and the last car ever owned by Groucho Marx.","The silver limousine was used to transport Prince Charles and princess Diana on their trip to Washington in 1985 .

Miss Alabama has been forced to change her telephone number after receiving 'thousands' of calls following her now-famous appearance in the stands at the BCS Championship game on Monday. And amid the swelling attention, Katherine Webb has cancelled eight interviews for Thursday, fearful that her new-found fame will spell bad news for her relationship with Alabama quarterback, A.J. McCarron, whom she has been dating for a month. Miss Webb, 23, shot to fame after ESPN's cameras panned to her in the first quarter of the game on Monday night, sparking fawning comments from sportscasters Kirk Herbstreit and Brent Musburger. Focus: Miss Alabama Katherine Webb has cancelled interviews so that her relationship with Alabama quarterback A.J. McCarron is viewed as sincere, rather than as a celebrity stunt . Ever since, her phone has been ringing off the hook, Donald Trump, who co-owns the Miss Universe Organization, told Page Six. 'She was forced to change her phone number,' Trump said. 'She was getting thousands and thousands of calls. Katherine has to stay grounded now that she's become a big star.' Webb also told TMZ that she has cancelled interviews scheduled for today because she is concerned her relationship with McCarron will simply be seen as a 'celebrity status' thing. 'I want it to be about me and him,' she said. 'He's a guy I can see myself having a real future with.' Who's that girl? Miss Webb, quickly became an internet sensation after appearing on camera on Monday . Fans: ESPN broadcasters Kirk Herbstreit, left, . and Brent Musburger, right, voiced their admiration for Webb as the . cameras picked her out in the crowd during the game on Monday night . She insisted that McCarron had not asked her to cancel the interviews, after TMZ had earlier reported that he was upset about being overshadowed by his girlfriend. The website had reported that the quarterback was unhappy that media outlets were ignoring his spectacular win over Notre Dame on Monday, and giving coverage to her instead. But other sources said the sports star just wanted to keep his private life out of the public eye, and wants his team's accomplishments to be recognised instead. Webb became an internet hit after her appearance at the Miami stadium. 'I'm telling you, you quarterbacks, you . get all the good looking women,' 73-year-old commentator Brent Musburger gushed as the camera stayed on Webb. 'What a beautiful woman.' Speaking out: Miss Webb appeared on the Today show on Wednesday to stick up for the commentators but she has now cancelled other interviews for Thursday .

'AJ's doing some things right down in Tuscaloosa.' 'If . you're a youngster in Alabama, start getting the football out and throw . it around the backyard with pop,' added Musburger, who has been married . to his wife Arlene for 50 years. With some media commentators and viewers branding their comments 'creepy', ESPN was forced to apologize on Tuesday. 'We . always try to capture interesting . storylines, and the relationship between an Auburn grad who is Miss . Alabama USA and the current Alabama quarterback certainly met that test. However, we apologize that the commentary in this instance went too far . and Brent understands that.' But the reigning Miss Alabama simply said she was 'flattered' by their remarks. Support: Webb and McCarron both laughed off the attention, and the QB added: 'I'm the one who's blessed' Crowned: Katherine Webb during her reign as Miss Alabama at the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas . 'If he had said something along the . lines of we were hot or sexy or any derogatory statements like that, . that would have been a bit different,' she told the Today show on Wednesday morning. 'The fact that he said we were beautiful and gorgeous - I don't see why any woman wouldn't be flattered by that.' But as well as Miss Webb herself, her father, Alan Webb, came to the defense of Musburger. 'On . one hand, you can look at it as being kind of like the dirty old man,' he said. 'But I'm used to this and I think if you really look into what . that he was trying to say, he was trying to be complimentary, and I . think they need to give Brent a break.' Fan: Miss Universe co-owner Donald Trump offered for Miss Webb to become a judge at Miss USA . Fan favourite: The 23-year-old is an Alabama native and graduated from Auburn University . Within minutes of ESPN broadcasting her image, Miss Webb became an internet sensation and saw her Twitter followers soar from around 2,300 to more than 205,000 by Tuesday evening. Donald Trump took to Twitter to say he would be offering Webb a place as a judge at the next Miss USA Pageant. 'We are proud of her,' he added. 'What a great couple... Katherine Webb and AJ McCarron. They are both winners.' Webb . was in shock about the reaction, revealing that her phone was . drained of battery thanks to an influx of new followers, texts and . calls, but to McCarron, the attention came as no surprise. 'I know she's good looking,' McCarron . said. 'She's gonna have guys that jaw-drop over her. That's life. I . guess I'm the blessed one at the end of the day. She's gotta put up with . me.' Winner: McCarron holds The Coaches' Trophy after the BCS National Championship college football game against Notre Dame on Monday night. Alabama won the title 42-14 .

His  mother Kerry Grist has also flown back to her home in Sheffield following the end of the operation. Mystery: Ben Needham (left) was just 21 months old when he vanished in July 1991. His mother Kerry Grist (right) has flown back to Britain from the Greek island of Kos following the latest unsuccessful search for him . Co-operation: Greek and British police worked together to search for Ben, but found not trace of him. He would be around 23 years-old now . Mrs Grist admitted she is relieved that the results of the search - which also involved Greek officers - have confirmed her belief that Ben, who would be 23 on Monday, is alive and well somewhere in the world. She said: 'This needed to be done for everybody’s sake. Obviously I’ve always believed that Ben’s out there somewhere and this has just confirmed it. 'I’ve had to think positively about it. It has been distressing but it's done now so I can move on. 'I’m really not sure what happens now. I . will be having meetings with South Yorkshire Police and it will be down . to them what the next steps are.' Investigation: British officers search the ground for any sign of Ben using a mechanical digger. They are now due to return to the UK . Painstaking: The latest search focused on a mound of soil and rubble near to where Ben went missing. It was thought the baby may have been covered by rubble during renovation work at the farmhouse . Mrs Grist said that whatever the police choose to do now, she was going to back them 'and support them in their next steps.' Det . Supt Matt Fenwick, from South Yorkshire Police, led the dig around the . farmhouse in the hamlet of . Iraklis that was being renovated when Ben disappeared 21 years ago. He . said: 'Even after the search we have done you can never say 100 per . cent, but the search has been so extensive and so thorough it is very . unlikely that he could be in the specific locations where we have . searched.” Ben . was being cared for by his grandparents Eddie and Christine Needham . when he vanished from outside the farmhouse. Painstaking: Officers used intricate techniques to search the ground in the area where the youngster went missing . Intensive: British police were granted a permit to carry out the search from the authorities on Kos . One . theory is the toddler was accidentally trapped beneath piles of dirt . and building material which were being dumped on the plot by a JCB . digger working nearby. Detectives . had believed that a small Dinky toy car belonging to Ben could be key . to discovering his fate. They used specialist scanning equipment to . search for signs of buried metal as well as possible human remains. Local . people in and around the village of Iraklise helped with the operation . to find the youngster. Intricate: It was hoped that the search would at least have revealed some clues to Ben's whereabouts - but none was found . At work: Officers used probes - together with more hi-tech equipment - to test the ground in their search for Ben . Authorities on Kos granted a permit for the excavation based on ‘reasonable suspicions’ by British police. The cost of the operation – certain . to be a substantial five figure sum – will be paid by British taxpayers.

Janet Bell, 43, believes she only has about six months to live unless she has a kidney transplant using an organ donated by a living donor . A woman who has been given just months to live unless she has a kidney transplant is so desperate to find a donor she has placed an advert in her local newspaper. Janet Bell, 43, was diagnosed with kidney failure 17 years ago and has already had two transplants. The second transplanted kidney has now failed and she is dependent on daily dialysis to keep her alive. But, her veins have been so badly damaged by years of dialysis that doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to find somewhere to insert a needle for the dialysis. As a result, she will die if a live donor is not found soon. The beauty salon owner told the Sunday Mirror: ‘I can’t stand the idea of just lying there waiting to die. I’ve asked friends and family, I’ve asked customers in my salon. I even put a status on Facebook but I still can’t find a match. ‘Short of walking down the street with a sandwich board on, there’s nothing else I can do. This advert is my last hope of survival.’ Ms Bell, from Cheshire, was first diagnosed with kidney failure in 1997 and she has since received two transplants from deceased donors. She had the first operation when she was 26 but her body rejected the new kidney meaning she had to have a second transplant. She was on the waiting list for eight years before eventually receiving another new kidney. This has now failed as well. As a result, she now needs another transplant. However, . this time she needs a live donor as the antibody levels in her body are . so high it would be impossible to find a deceased donor whose kidney . her body would not reject. An . antibody is a protein substance that is made by the body's immune . system in response to a foreign object - such as a transplanted organ. Ms Bell is so desperate to find a kidney donor she has placed an advertisement in her local paper, the Cheshire Chronicle, appealing for potential donors to come forward . These antibodies will attack a transplanted kidney if it is seen as a foreign object. As a result, all potential donors have to be screened to see if they have antigens which react with the recipient's antibodies. As . she has already had two transplants, Ms Bell has so many antibodies her body would reject any new kidney she received from a deceased donor. Ms Bell is currently dependent on daily dialysis for her survival but she has had so many years of dialysis her veins are damaged and doctors are finding it increasingly difficult to find somewhere to insert the needle . This means she has to find a living donor. Ms . Bell told the Sunday Mirror: ‘Dialysis is only buying me time. Without a . living donor I probably have about six months or a year left at most.’ She explained that she is desperate for a new kidney as she wants to be around to look after her parents as they get older. She said it is heart-breaking to think of them having to watch her die before them. In a last ditch attempt to find a donor, Ms Bell placed an advertisement in the Chester Chronicle. It read: ‘My name is Jan and I've got just months to live unless I can find a live kidney donor. Ms Bell told the Sunday Mirror: 'I can't stand the idea of just lying there waiting to die. I've asked friends and family, I've asked customers in my salon. I even put a status on Facebook but I still can't find a match' ‘This is my last chance as I've tried everything and not found a match. If you would be willing to help save my life and donate a kidney please call for more information.' Ms Bell told ITV’s Daybreak that she has already had one response to the advert. She said: ‘It’s a start, which is great.’ However, she went on to explain that the chance of that person being a match is very small meaning she needs more people to come forward to give her the best chance possible.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 11:05 EST, 3 September 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:14 EST, 3 September 2013 . David Miliband today put himself at odds with his Labour leader brother Ed to warn that international intervention in Syria is ‘increasingly necessary’. The former foreign secretary condemned the failure of western governments including Britain to ‘break the diplomatic and military deadlock’ and warned humanitarian aid cannot reach refugees because aid agencies are coming under ‘aerial bombardment’. His warning that Syria risks becoming a ‘dangerous no-man’s-land’ like Afghanistan appears at odds with Ed Miliband’s insistence that Labour will not back a second vote on UK military intervention. Action: David Miliband (right) warned that the unpopularity of international action in Syria must not be an excuse for inaction, despite his brother Ed (left) ruling out British intervention . There have been growing signs of division in Labour ranks since David Cameron’s call for action was rejected by a majority of 13 MPs in the Commons last week. Some 30 Tory rebels as well as nine Liberal Democrats joined with Labour to inflict a humiliating defeat on the Prime Minister. Amid growing signs of Labour disarray over the stance taken last week by Ed Miliband – who is accused of indicating support for the Government only to pull the plug at the last minute – Shadow Cabinet ministers Jim Murphy and Chuka Umunna suggested a second vote may be needed. But last night a senior Labour source warned: ‘We caution against any idea of a rerun of a Syria vote.' It is thought that some on the Labour frontbench were spooked by polls showing the public was overwhelmingly against another British military foray in the Middle East. Briefing: President Barack Obama held talks with Republican senators John McCain (left) and Lindsey Graham about his plans to degrade the Syrian regime . David Miliband, who lost out on the Labour leadership to his brother three years ago, quit the Commons to become chief executive of New York-based aid charity International Rescue Committee. In an article for the Financial Times, he argued that the unpopularity of international action in Syria was not an excuse for inaction. He said: ‘It is clear that, while international engagement is decreasingly popular in the advanced democracies, a multipolar world makes it increasingly necessary. ‘Humanitarian intervention is about human need, not political sides – but it has political consequences. ‘There is capacity to save more lives, but this needs resources and political will. The drums of war are reason to redouble humanitarian efforts, not forget them.’ It comes after it emerged the Syrian civil war has now forced 2million refugees to flee the country. The UN High Commissioner for Refugees described the conflict as 'the great tragedy of this century' as he laid bare the scale of the suffering it has caused, with more than 1million children forced out of their homeland. In addition to those who have left Syria during the two-and-a-half-year war, 4.25million people have been displaced within the country. In total, around a third of the population have been forced to leave their homes, meaning the conflict has prompted the world's biggest refugee crisis. Recall: There were calls of 'resign' from the Labour benches before David Cameron told the Commons that Britain would play no part in military action against Syria . He insisted that ‘none of the military options being canvassed – or, in the UK, rejected – promises a decisive shift in the course of the conflict’. An audit by the IRC reveals a grim ‘litany of suffering’, adding: ‘The dynamics are all going in the wrong direction and the prospects are bleak. ‘For geopolitical reasons, as well as basic humanity, we need a fundamental step change in the scale of effort.’ US President Barack Obama today said he was confident that Congress would back his plan for intervention in Syria. But he said he was ready to change the language of the motion to ensure it attracted widespread support. The President said: 'So long as we . are accomplishing what needs to be accomplished, which is to send a . clear message to Assad, to degrade his capabilities to use chemical . weapons, not just now but also in the future, as long as the . authorization allows us to do that, I'm confident that we're going to be . able to come up with something that hits that mark.' And Mr Obama insisted: 'This is not Iraq, and this is not Afghanistan.' French president Francoise . Hollande said he would to wait for the US Congress decision on military . action in Syria before deciding on any action France might take. Meanwhile Michael Gove today accused Labour MPs . of behaving like fans at a ‘football match’ cheering at the result of . the Commons vote against military action in Syria. The . Education Secretary condemned the Ed Miliband’s party for ‘celebrating’ at a time when ‘children had been killed by a ruthless dictator’. But . the bitter recriminations of the vote continued, with Labour claiming . Mr Gove’s comments were ‘puerile, stupid and grossly offensive’. The . unexpected defeat by just 13 votes on Thursday night was the first time . since 1782 that a government had lost a vote on war and peace. Furious: Michael Gove, pictured entering Number 10 today, stepped up his criticism of Labour MPs in the wake of last week's Syria vote . In . the corridors of Parliament afterwards Mr Gove, a staunch backer of . military action in Syria, shouted 'you're a disgrace' at those MPs who . opposed the Government in the tense vote. Today the Cabinet Minister admitted he had become ‘heated’ but stepped up his criticism of the behaviour of Labour MPs. There . were cheers and shouts of ‘resign’ from the Labour benches as the . result – 285 votes to 272 – was announced to a shocked House of Commons. Mr Gove told BBC Breakfast: ‘I did become heated last week, that is absolutely right. ‘At . the moment that the Government lost the vote on the motion, there were . Labour MPs cheering as though it were a sort of football match and they . had just won. ‘At the same time on the news, we were hearing about an attack on a school in Syria and the death toll there rising. ‘And . the incongruity of Labour MPs celebrating as children had been killed . by a ruthless dictator, I am afraid got to me and I did feel incredibly . emotional. I do feel emotional about this subject.’ The remarks lay bare the depth of anger in the government at the way Labour approached the vote. But Labour Party vice-chairman Michael Dugher said Mr Gove’s comments were ‘grossly offensive’. ‘Michael Gove's comments today are puerile, stupid & grossly offensive,’ the MP wrote on Twitter. ‘A desperate, low and partisan attack that demeans his office.’","Former foreign secretary says aid workers under attack in Syria .

The weekly supermarket shop can be a perplexing chore – so much so, say experts, that we are missing out on bargains. Shoppers pushing trolleys through the aisles are confronted with so many competing posters and signs that they cannot take them all in, according to behaviour analysts. As a result, the subconscious takes over and we tend to fill our trolleys with items regardless of whether or not they are good value. Bombarded by offers: All the half price signs in a Tesco supermarket. But research has revealed our brain cannot take in all the offers . A study cites the example of DVDs priced at £4.24 each that suddenly saw an increase in sales when a sign appeared promoting them at ‘Two for £10’. Similarly, sales of a big brand lager placed under a prominent sign soared by 10 per cent compared with rival brands on the same aisle. The brain of the shoppers apparently registered the sign as evidence that the lager was on special offer when, in fact, it simply read: ‘Thieves will be prosecuted.’ And while supermarkets routinely use so-called BOGOF deals – buy one, get one free – to tempt customers, researchers say it appears that many people are immune to them. Despite a BOGOF deal on teabags, nearly half of shoppers simply bought just one box, rather than picking up the second free one. BOGOFs on baked beans and cheese got a similar reaction. Phillip Adcock, managing director of behaviour analysts SBXL, said the research suggests people are influenced by the fact that a product is being promoted, but are less likely to take in the detail. (Source :SBXL) SBXL sends teams of researchers into stores to monitor real life  evidence of how people shop. Mr Adcock said: ‘Our brains just cannot cope with the number of decisions we have to make in a store. We will see a different offer every three-quarters of a second in a supermarket and we just can’t cope. ‘If you are faced with 85 different types of lager in an aisle, the brain just automatically tries to slim that down to a smaller number. ‘If there are four or five on special offer, the brain will use that as a  reference for a bargain. It is not something you consciously notice.’ ‘In a number of studies we have carried out, it is clear that the precise nature of a special offer or deal was much less important than the presentation of the promotion. ‘Shoppers are unable to make detailed calculations in-store and so they take shortcuts or start to guess. What they actually do is reduce their choice to anything that stands out above the rest.’ Mr Adcock said: ‘The message to shoppers is to take more time taking  in the detail of a promotion in  order to understand what the saving is – if any. ‘The message to supermarkets is that it doesn’t really matter what the offer is as long as the product is  visually prominent.’ Promotions: Offers in Tesco and Co-op stores but research has shown we cannot tell if we are getting value .

"By . Emily Andrews . UPDATED: . 06:24 EST, 3 January 2012 . Nivin El Gamal arriving at the High Court, where it was accepted that an Islamic ceremony had taken place at the sheikh's Knightsbridge flat in January 2007 before an imam and witnesses . It's the stuff of little girls’ dreams. Fall madly in love with a rich prince, marry them and live happily ever after. Unfortunately for former model Nivin El Gamal, real life didn’t follow the fairy-tale. Yesterday at London’s High Court the acrimonious breakdown of her relationship with a member of Dubai’s ruling family was laid bare in excruciating detail. She claimed that she secretly married Sheikh Ahmed Al Maktoum, one of the Middle East’s richest men with a £19billion fortune, in an Islamic ceremony in London four years ago. He lavished gifts on her such as a Bulgari diamond-encrusted watch and large sums of money, and she went on to become pregnant with their child. But when he had an official marriage with his royal cousin in 2008, she was unceremoniously dumped and Sheikh Ahmed denied they were ever in a relationship – calling her an ‘occasional sexual partner’. Moreover he denied there was ever any ceremony and that the woman who claimed to be his ‘wife’ was no more than a ‘courtesan’ who attached herself to rich men to buy her things. He even refused to recognise the . paternity of their son, now three, until he took a DNA test under the . pseudonym Robert Smith which confirmed he was his father. Much to Miss El Gamal’s distress Sheikh Ahmed, 53, has never met his son, Saeed, nor officially recognised him as such. Yesterday, in a ruling on their . ‘marriage’, Mr Justice Bodey accepted that the Islamic ceremony had . taken place at the sheikh’s Knightsbridge flat in January 2007 before an . imam and two of the sheikh’s staff as witnesses. But he ruled it could not be recognised in English law, therefore denying her the opportunity to seek any maintenance. The judge also made it clear he was . unhappy with the sheikh’s failure to attend court on Monday, as . scheduled, because he was called to the Gulf Co-operation Council in . Riyadh instead. Egyptian . born Miss El Gamal, 35, had met Sheikh Ahmed, chairman of Emirates . airline and sponsor of Arsenal Football Club, on a holiday to Dubai in . 2003. As the uncle of . Dubai’s ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Sheikh Ahmed is the . public face of ‘Dubai Inc’, the web of companies behind the state’s . prosperity. Miss El . Gamal had said the pair took part in an urfi marriage – a traditional . form of Islamic marriage that does not require an official contract – at . Sheikh Ahmed’s flat and that she had worn an Armani outfit as he had asked her to dress simply. During such ceremonies the couple repeat the words ‘we got married’ and pledge their commitment before God. Her lawyer Richard Todd QC had . previously told the court that she was given a £30,000 dowry by Sheikh . Ahmed and a further £3,000 to buy a wedding ring with 17 diamonds. Miss . El Gamal had told Sheikh Ahmed: ‘I have no one in the world but you’, . and had excitedly told friends that she was marrying the man she loved. In . contrast his lawyers branded her a liar who invented the ‘marriage’ in . an attempt to get £1million a year maintenance from him. Sheikh Ahmed, chairman of Emirates airline and sponsor of Arsenal Football Club, met Miss El Gamal on a holiday to Dubai in 2003 . In . what her counsel Richard Todd QC described as ‘the case of the prince . and the pauper’ she sought a declaration that her ‘marriage’ to the . sheikh be declared null and void. But . the sheikh’s counsel Martin Pointer QC claimed she was only an . ‘irregular’ sexual partner of the sheikh, a ‘courtesan’ who ‘had a . fantasy that he would marry you’. After . his paternity was established the sheikh agreed to pay substantial . maintenance to Miss El Gamal and their son, who now live in a £3million . property in central London. Outside . court Miss El Gamal, who comes from a prominent family in Egyptian . society, said: ‘I embarked on this nullity petition to get recognition . of the fact that I went through a ceremony of marriage, a ceremony . recognised as valid in Islam and thereby became his first wife. ‘I am delighted Mr Justice Bodey has rejected the hurtful assertion by the sheikh that there was no such marriage. 'I . recognise and have always recognised that although our marriage was . valid as far as we were concerned, it was not capable of founding a . petition for divorce in England; hence my petition for nullity. ‘I hope now that HRH Sheikh Al Maktoum will formally recognise his son as legitimate according to Islam.’","Court accepts Islamic ceremony between Nivin El Gamal and Sheikh Ahmed took place in London flat in 2007 before an imam .

"By . Daniel Bates . UPDATED: . 21:16 EST, 21 February 2012 . As a member of one of Europe’s most glamorous dynasties, he has long been accustomed to wealth, fame and power. And when it came to the sight of another man with a woman he wanted, Prince Pierre Casiraghi of Monaco was apparently unable to control himself. The 24-year-old prince, son of Princess Caroline and grandson of Grace Kelly, allegedly got into a fight with a stranger at an exclusive New York nightclub because he was ‘jealous’ of him. Court: Prince Pierre Casiraghi, pictured, and his friends were accused by lawyers of being jealous because Adam Hock was with a group of beautiful women, referring to them as 'trust-fund babies' and 'spoiled brats' Friends: Stavros Niarchos III, heir to a Greek shipping fortune was with his girlfriend, model, Jessica Hart, when the fight broke out and he tried to help the prince . Former nightclub owner Adam Hock was . sitting with two friends and three catwalk models when Pierre, the third . in line to Monaco’s throne, allegedly approached him and started a . confrontation. Hock is said to have punched Pierre . and sent him flying into a table on the other side of the room, where he . landed with blood pouring from his face. ‘Pierre’s face looked broken, . with deep cuts and blood everywhere,’ said one witness. ‘He looked like . he needed plastic surgery.’ Brawl: It is believed the fight started following a late-night confrontation between the 24-year-old prince and his friends and former Manhattan club owner Adam Hock, pictured . The 47-year-old was arrested and . later appeared in court, charged with four counts of assault against . Prince Pierre and three of his friends. Hock’s lawyer, Sal Strazzullo, said: . ‘My  client was with some very very nice women and Mr Casiraghi became . jealous of who he was with. They wanted some recognition [from the . women] and it happened because of that. My client acted in self- . defence, it was an unprovoked attack. ‘I don’t know why Mr Casiraghi got . jealous about my client – he is from a humble background.’ He added: ‘My . client is not Bruce Lee… These four guys are trust-fund babies who . think the world is owed to them. They are like spoiled brats.’ But one of the prince’s friends said he was ‘slammed for no reason’, and that another was punched when he tried to intervene. Richard Golub, who is representing the prince and his friends, said the incident was ‘entirely unprovoked’. Pierre’s family have a long history . of  scandal and intrigue, and the latest episode seems to suggest he is . following in their footsteps. Known as the ‘party prince’, Pierre . is believed to have dropped out of university and has been seen at . nightclubs everywhere from Miami to Milan. The fight broke out on Saturday, at . the Double Seven club in Manhattan’s Meatpacking District. Prince Pierre . and his entourage, who were drinking £350 bottles of champagne, are . said to have gone over to Hock’s table and started behaving . ‘obnoxiously’. Among those with the prince was . Jessica Hart, a supermodel, Stavros Niarchos III, a shipping heir and . ex-boyfriend of Paris Hilton, Vladimir Restoin Roitfeld, a New York art . dealer and godson to photographer Mario Testino, and Diego Marroquin, a .

Hock is said to have punched Prince Pierre . in the face and lashed out at three of his friends, one of whom . allegedly grabbed a bottle of Grey Goose vodka and tried to hit Hock . with it. The prince was taken to hospital for treatment and released a short time later. The episode once again puts  the . spotlight on Monaco’s royals – or the Grimaldi family, as they are . better known.

A clarinet player developed a rare form of pneumonia because he failed to clean his clarinet for 30 years . A clarinet player developed a rare form of pneumonia because he failed to clean his instrument for 30 years. The unnamed 68-year-old man from Atlanta, U.S., suffered from ‘saxophone lung’ for a year. The condition is an allergic reaction to a fungus that grows inside wind instruments. It causes symptoms including wheezing and coughing and symptoms will continue until the instrument is cleaned. Dr Marissa Shams, from the Emory University Adult Asthma, Allergy and Immunology Clinic, explained that the man was having an allergic reaction to mould inside the instrument, NBC News reports. Dr Shams, who presented the case at the annual meeting of the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology, explained that the man was playing his clarinet several nights a week and that each time he was breathing in the fungus. The patient’s symptoms did not respond to inhalers, steroids or antibiotics so doctors initially thought he was suffering from an excessive immune response to a fungus called Aspergillus. However, when they heard about his clarinet playing they carried out a chest X-ray that revealed his lungs were full off mucus and blockages. They then discovered he was allergic to two fungi and that the reed of his clarinet was contaminated with another mould – Exophiala. ‘There was very impressive fungal growth on those,’ Dr Shams told NBC News. She added that once he had been given more oral steroids and cleaned his clarinet, his health improved dramatically. This clarinet player is not the first to suffer the ill effects of a dirty instrument. Doctors discovered the man was allergic a fungus - Exophiala (pictured) - that the reed of his clarinet was contaminated with. Once he had sterilised the instrument, he recovered rapidly . In March, an English bagpiper, John Shone, 78, told how he nearly died after picking up a lung infection from his bagpipes. It is believed germs can survive for hours, or even days, on wind instruments that are not cleaned. As a result, experts recommend that they are regularly sterilised.","The 68-year-old American man suffered coughing and wheezing for a year .

The I/O conference is due to start at 5pm GMT (9am PDT) and is expected to last for three hours. Much of the speculation about the conference has centered on a possible upgrade to the Nexus 7, the company's budget 7-inch Android tablet. A new version of the Nexus 7 is expected to have a faster processor and a higher resolution display screen. Another Google-designed, Nexus handset is also a possibility, as is a handset from Google-owned Motorola. There is also speculation that Google will unveil a music-streaming service that would mean Android users can to listen to their favourite songs and artists for a monthly fee. Google has long been rumored to be in . talks with music labels to work out the licensing rights for a service . that would compete with Spotify, Rdio and other streaming services. 'It’s always good to see new companies and competition in the digital music space, and Google has a proven track record in bringing quality products to market. ' Commenting on the rumours, Ben Drury CEO at digital music store 7digital said: 'The rumoured service has a similar issue for consumers as other established players in the market – that it will likely be linked to one platform from one company, in this case Google’s Android OS/Play Music service. 'This approach is an outdated one for consumers, who are using more and more devices from multiple companies that are constantly connected to the internet.

Brighton medical student Hester Stewart, 21, died in 2009 after taking the then legal drug GBL. Special legal high clinics have been set up in Brighton in a bid to tackle the rise in use of the substances. Health and social care charity CRI - Crime Reduction Initiative - has opened the clinics, believed to be the first in the country, following the deaths of several young people. Brighton medical student Hester Stewart, 21, died in 2009 after taking the then legal drug GBL. Her mother Maryon Stewart has since set up the Angelus Foundation calling for more information about legal highs. CRI says the new access points will offer 'a range of services from advice and information to a full assessment and access to structured treatment' to help people kick their addiction. Michael Lawrence, who works at CRI, said: 'Novel psychoactive substances (NPS) otherwise known as ""legal highs"" or ""club drugs"" have changed the local drug scene hugely over the last year. 'The assumption people make is that because they are legal they must be safe, but that isn't the case. 'We hope that by setting up this new service we will encourage more people to seek advice prior to taking anything.' The clinics are opened in partnership with the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and are open two evenings a week to access as many people as possible. Health and social care charity CRI confirmed it had opened two drop-in centres in Brighton to address the increased use of legal highs in the city. Pictured is one of the centres . The clinics have been opened in partnership with the Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust and are open two evenings a week to access as many people as possible . Mr Lawrence added: 'We have seen many . people come in shocked at the type of experience they have had with . NPS, which has often lead them into risky situations, particularly if . mixed with alcohol. 'Some have ended up in A&E or have been arrested. Hester Stewart, 21, an outstanding medical student who dreamed of becoming a surgeon, was found dead by police after a party in 2009. According to a friend, she had taken a liquid drug called GBL. At the time the drug was legal but it was banned in December 2009 following a spate of deaths. At the time of Hester's death, her mother Maryon Stewart, a well-known nutritionist who promotes natural health remedies, said that she felt 'cheated, frustrated and angry' that the Home Office had not acted on their promise made the previous August to ban the drug. Mrs Stewart has since set up the Angelus Foundation calling for more information about legal highs. 'We just don't know enough about the long term effects of any of the ""legal highs"" but even the short term effects can be extremely dangerous. 'We'd advise people not to start using these untested substances at all, but to be fully informed if you do choose to take them.' In August it was reported deaths involving legal highs increased by 80 per cent last year –  to one every week. Figures from the Office for National Statistics show fatalities relating to the psychoactive substances rose from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012 – compared to 22 in 2010. Drugs such as 'meow meow', 'Black Mamba' and 'Benzo Fury' were all legal when they were first produced, but have since been outlawed. However, banning the substances has had no effect on the number of deaths they have caused, which increased from 29 in 2011 to 52 in 2012, according to the Office for National Statistics. Among legal highs, deaths involving a substance called cathinone tripled from six in 2011 to 18 in 2012.

In a major blow to the Prime Minister’s strategy, Herman Van Rompuy said the European Union would fall apart quickly if countries were allowed to pick and choose which powers they wanted to keep. Mr Van Rompuy said he wanted Britain to stay in the EU, adding that the UK’s departure would ‘see a friend walk off into the desert’. But he insisted that he would block Mr Cameron’s bid to secure a better deal for  Britain if it involved repatriating significant powers to Westminster. Mr Cameron is expected to call for renegotiation of Britain’s relationship with the EU when he makes his long-awaited speech on Europe next month. The Prime Minister is expected to say that a referendum will be held only when the negotiations are completed – probably some time after the next election. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said yesterday that discussion of a referendum before the eurozone crisis has been resolved was ‘putting the cart before the horse’. The Lib Dem leader, whose 2010 manifesto pledged to hold an in/out referendum on Europe, said he now disapproved of the idea and that talk of a referendum was  premature and amounted to no more than ‘political shadow boxing’. ‘What we really should be doing is just focusing on the kind of economic firestorm at hand, working co-operatively to help them to put out the fire in the eurozone and to come out of this phase of economic emergency,’ he said in yesterday’s Guardian. ‘I think to have a referendum, kind of about nothing very much in particular, when you’re in the middle of an emergency repair job to your own economy and European economy, is putting the cart before the horse. It’s an exercise of political shadow boxing to try and anticipate a process of which we’re not one of the principal authors and then start now prescribing how we should react to it.’ A poll, also in yesterday’s Guardian, found that euroscepticism is growing among voters. More than half of those polled by ICM, 51 per cent, said they would vote to take the UK out of the EU if a referendum took place tomorrow. In autumn 2011, when ICM asked the same question, opinion was already leaning in the anti-European direction, by 49 per cent against 40 per cent. However, Mr Clegg said  that past prime ministers from Margaret Thatcher to Tony Blair had offered ‘extraordinary leadership’ in the EU, and that Britain should once again put itself at the forefront of developments. Deputy prime minister Nick Clegg said yesterday that discussion of a referendum before the eurozone crisis has been resolved was 'putting the cart before the horse' Ministers have already started a review of which EU powers should be repatriated as part of any renegotiation package. But Mr Van Rompuy told today’s Guardian: ‘If every member state were able to cherry pick those parts of existing policies that they most like and opt out of those that they least like, the union in general, and the single market in particular, would soon unravel. ‘All member states can and do have particular requests and needs that are always taken into consideration as part of our deliberations. I do not expect any member state to seek to undermine the fundamentals of our co-operative system in Europe.’ Mr Van Rompuy said sweeping changes to the governance of the EU could even be brought in without a fresh treaty in order to avoid referendums in member states – leaving Mr Cameron with no leverage to demand concessions for Britain. In a separate interview Germany’s powerful finance minister Wolfgang Schauble said Britain would struggle to make itself heard in the world if it quit the EU. Mr Van Rompuy’s comments suggest that Mr Cameron’s hopes of a major renegotiation may be dead in the water before they have even started. Tory MP Douglas Carswell said last night that the EU president’s ‘arrogant’ comments underlined the need for an early in/out referendum on Europe. ‘What Van Rompuy calls cherry picking most people would call self-government,’ Mr Carswell said. Tory MP John Baron stepped up calls for legislation enabling a referendum to be put in place before the next election.","Herman Van Rompuy said the EU would fall apart quickly if countries were allowed to pick and choose powers .

While style chameleons such as Rihanna and Miley Cyrus constantly change their look, it seems that for the rest of us, staying true to old favourites trumps freshening up our appearance. According to a new survey, just like the Duchess of Cambridge, more than two thirds of us admit to eschewing trends in favour of sticking to a style that suits. And it isn't just fashion trends that we're avoiding. More than 56 per cent of women admit to leaving their make-up unchanged over the last five years while 65 per cent say they haven’t changed their hairstyle either. Spot the difference: The Duchess of Cambridge has stayed true to her style and rarely rings the changes . Younger women are more likely to adopt radical changes to their look, with the survey pointing out that most of us don't feel comfortable with our signature style until the age of 42. Nevertheless, more than a third of women admitted to having had the same dress sense, colour and make-up as they did a decade ago. There are also regional differences, with Northern Irish ladies proving to be the most daring about changing their hairstyle, with 57 per cent following Jennifer Aniston and Jennifer Lawrence's lead and rocking a short crop, while those who live in the East Midlands are fans of a perm. Londoners like to keep it simple with 73 per cent opting for a long and straight hairstyle, championed by Gwyneth Paltrow among others. Chameleon: Miley Cyrus has transformed from good girl to twerking rock n' roller in just five years . Londoners are also the most confident about their personal style and don’t follow celebrity trends - unlike those from the north. And if you're thinking of going for the chop, you might want to reconsider after the survey revealed that 60 per cent of women regret cutting off their long hair, with another 40 per cent regretting a drastic change of colour. Brunette topped the 'hair-o-meter' as the favourite hue for hair with over 40 per cent preferring a darker shade, perhaps as a result of the Duchess of Cambridge effect. Tom . Newbald, a spokesman for Feelunique.com, which carried out the survey, said: . 'It’s no surprise that women prefer to stick to a style that suits them . but it’s extremely interesting to see how often they change their look . or style. 'Every woman, whether 20 years old or 60 years old will have their own unique style and individuality.'

French police were last night accused of jeopardising the investigation by rushing forensic searches at the murder scene. Vital evidence may have been missed as a result of a ‘hasty’ hunt for clues at the secluded spot, British experts said. They expressed astonishment that French detectives allowed the media and public to trample over the crime scene on Friday, less than 48 hours after the shootings. Evidence: British experts have expressed astonishment that French detectives allowed the media and public to trample over the crime scene on Friday, less than 48 hours after the shootings . On Saturday, three days after the killings, members of the public were free to drive up to the unguarded murder scene, and park on the very spot where Saad Al-Hilli, his wife and his mother-in-law were shot. Blood and glass, possibly linked to the atrocity, had still not been cleared up. Bushes and vegetation next to the crime scene, where the killer may have hidden before the executions, did not appear to have been checked for any evidence. The revelations will increase pressure on the French police, who have already faced questions over how Mr Al-Hilli’s four-year-old daughter Zeena lay undiscovered under her mother’s corpse in the family’s BMW for eight hours. On Saturday, three days after the killings, members of the public were free to drive up to the unguarded murder scene, and park on the very spot where Saad Al-Hilli, his wife and his mother-in-law were shot . Mystery: Bushes and vegetation next to the crime scene, where the killer may have hidden before the executions, did not appear to have been checked for any evidence . Critics also questioned why: . Police have not made specific public appeals for information about possible suspects. Scotland Yard murder squad veteran Ian Horrocks, a Home Office accredited crime scene manager, said: ‘I haven’t visited the crime scene, so I am loath to criticise anyone, however it does seem from the pictures and video that the examination of the scene has been hasty. House-to-house inquiries are incomplete and roadblocks are not in place to ask drivers if they saw anything suspicious on Wednesday afternoon . ‘If this was in the UK the whole . parking area would have been sealed off, and for several days. A . substantial part of the adjacent woodland should also be sealed off. Victim: Saad Al-Hilli as well as his wife and his mother-in-law were shot . ‘The area should be protected from any . contamination. 'Anything could be there, cigarette butts, fibres, hairs, . any number of potential items that could either assist in identifying . suspects or show they have been there. 'I do not know if this has been done, but journalists and the public should not be able to walk around there. ‘I have seen on TV that both blood and glass remains at the scene. This should all have been taken. Whose blood is it, what car does the glass come from? 'It cannot be assumed the blood is all the victims’, and the glass from their car.’ Ex-Met Detective Chief Superintendent Kevin Hurley said 100 officers would be working on an equivalent murder inquiry in Britain. He added: ‘It is unclear whether the killers followed Mr Al-Hilli’s car or were lying in wait, possibly in the bushes. 'For that reason, I am concerned that vegetation nearby has not been removed and tested for DNA, hair and blood samples.’ The British cyclist who discovered the massacre has told police he saw a green 4x4 and a motorbike in the area. Police said 25 bullets were fired in the attack and sources have said initial ballistic tests point to a single weapon being used. French public prosecutor Eric Maillaud said police had been at the scene yesterday and had widened the area of investigation.","French detectives allowed the media and public to trample over the crime scene on Friday .

It describes the suspect in the sexual assault case as being between 5ft 9ins and 5ft 11ins. Winston is listed by Florida State at 6ft 4ins. Timothy Jansen, a Tallahassee attorney, said Winston hasn't been interviewed by police. Jansen said that at one point he had believed the matter had been resolved.

The Witch Is Dead to number one would be 'cathartic' for many . A protester behind a campaign to get anti-Thatcher song Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead to number one in the charts believes buying the July Garland hit is 'cathartic' for those who hated the Tory prime minister. Mark Biddiss, 39, denies his cause is wrong and disrespectful to the Iron Lady, claiming: 'It is not about the song, it is giving people a voice'. His campaign, backed by Left-wing agitators, has caused the song from the Wizard Of Oz to rise in the pop charts this week, and now sits at number three, MailOnline has learned. As well as rising up the official charts, the track, which costs 79p online, is currently No1 on iTunes, and the BBC is planning to play the song on Sunday. In the past, songs deemed to be too controversial have been banned from the airwaves by the BBC. Meanwhile counter-protesters have today launched a late campaign to encourage people to buy: 'I'm In Love With Margaret Thatcher', a 1980 punk single by the Notsensibles. 'I am not an anarchist, and I am not going out to protest. This is a group of normal people who want be heard. I wanted to help this community,' Mr Biddiss told MailOnline. 'I feel a bit of sympathy for her. To have something like this marking her death shows how strongly feel about her. 'It is a comment about her as a state figure and what she did, not about her as a person or her family. People aren't having a go at her as an old lady. 'She never said sorry for anything she did. She did not make Britain great, she took a lot away from Britain. 'I think there is quite a tidal wave of emotion with this and it is a very cathartic experience for a lot of people who feel that for many years they haven't been listened to. I think they now feel they are being listened to. 'The big difference between this song and what Margaret Thatcher never did is listen to people. I don't think she even listened to her cabinet'. Climbing up the charts: The Wizard Of Oz track which has had a surge of popularity in the wake of Baroness Thatcher's death is on course for a place in the top five . Online push: A message running on the Facebook group which has been set up to push the song to number one in this week's chart . Mr Biddiss, who describes himself as a . humourist, writer and event curator, criticised national newspapers who have been critical of his campaign, calling them 'out of . touch'. But he and the thousands who have been buying the pop song have been called 'feeble', 'deeply offensive' and 'disrespectful' by those against them. Jonathan Aitken confronted Mr Biddiss on ITV's Daybreak this morning. 'I think this is a pretty feeble form of protest,' he said. 'The way to treat this is the way . that Lady Thatcher would have treated it - to rise above it with dignity . and maybe some disdain. 'The one thing we shouldn't do is censor a song that which after all has been around for 50 years or more. 'This is an opportunistic move by a group of protesters to get a bit of publicity for them and their cause. 'People who have respect for Lady Thatcher and her views will not find this anything other than a distasteful affair. 'People have been listening to this . song for decades. It is not new, what is new is that people like you are . trying to get cheap publicity.' UKIP leader Nigel Farage said today: 'If you suppress things then you make them popular, so play the b***** thing. If you ban it it will be number one for weeks. 'Personally I think that the behaviour of these yobs - most of whom weren’t even born when Lady Thatcher was in power - is horrible, offensive and disgusting'. Row: Mr Baddiss and former MP Jonathan Aitken clashed over the campaign on ITV's Daybreak this morning . Insiders confirmed yesterday that, . in a decision which will cause widespread outrage, Ding Dong! will . feature in Radio 1's Sunday-evening Top 40 countdown. Before it is played, it is planned to . use a reporter from the BBC1 news programme Newsbeat to explain to the . station's target audience of young listeners why the song has risen in . the charts. MPs from both Labour and the . Conservative party united in saying it would be wrong to give airtime to . a song denigrating our greatest peacetime Prime Minister less than a . week after her death. The ruling comes after accusations of . 'Left-wing bias' over the BBC's coverage of Lady Thatcher's death. It . could be the first major leadership test for new director general Tony . Hall, the chairman of the Culture Media and Sport select committee . warned last night. John Whittingdale said: 'This is an . attempt to manipulate the charts by people trying to make a political . point. Most people will find that offensive and deeply insensitive, and . for that reason it would be better if the BBC did not play it. It's a . political act. The BBC will now need to decide if they will play the 1939 tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown, hosted by Jameela Jamil, left.  It is still some distance behind the week’s biggest selling single, Need U (100%) by Duke Dumont , right, FT A*M*E . Place in the charts: The song is also on course to become the shortest top 10 single ever, with the most popular version running to 51 seconds . The power of a Facebook campaign should not be underestimated. In 2009 a Facebook campaign was designed to prevent another X Factor number one. As a consequence Rock band Rage Against the Machine won the most competitive battle in years for the Christmas number one. The band's single, Killing In The Name, sold 500,000 downloads beating X Factor winner Joe McElderry's The Climb by 50,000 copies to clinch the top spot. 'Sometimes the BBC has taken the . decision not to play a record because it is offensive, such as the Sex . Pistols' God Save the Queen, but that is a matter for the director . general, who will be appearing before my committee in two weeks.' Labour backbencher Gerry Sutcliffe . added: 'Obviously nobody wants censorship of music or culture but there . has to be dignity in death. While I disagreed with everything she stood . for, she was a leader and a Prime Minister so I don't think it would be a . good idea to promote that single.' Ding Dong! The Witch Is Dead was . written for the soundtrack of the 1939 film The Wizard Of Oz and sung by . Judy Garland, who played Dorothy, the Munchkins and Glinda the Good . Witch, played by Billie Burke. The song, written by E.Y. Harburg and . composed by Harold Arlen, is sung as they celebrate the death of the . Wicked Witch of the East after Dorothy 'dropped a house on her'. It . includes the lyrics: 'Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead/She's gone where . the goblins go/Below, below, below.' Since Lady Thatcher died on Monday, it . has become an anthem of hate for hordes of Left-wingers who have set up . Facebook pages encouraging their friends to buy it. Supporters of Lady Thatcher urged the . public to download Madonna's song True Blue – the Whitehall codename for . the preparations for her funeral – instead. Decision: In what could be seen as the first major test for the new director general Tony Hall, the BBC will now have to take a decision about whether they will play the tune during Radio 1's top 40 countdown when places are finalised at the weekend . Conservative peer Baroness Buscombe . said: 'So many of these people who are buying this song probably weren't . even alive when she was turning this country from being entirely broke, . with no future or prospects, into one giving us all hope and enterprise . and inspiration. I think it's a great shame if people think it's the . right thing to do to dance on her death.' Tory MP Henry Smith said it would be . 'silly and absurd' for the BBC to play the track on Sunday. He said: . 'The song is in particularly poor taste. If I was the person in charge . of making the decision I would choose not to play that track. However, . it is ultimately irrelevant. Margaret Thatcher's towering reputation . will survive this. She was someone who stood for freedom of expression, . so we can't ban these sick and misguided protests.' Another Conservative MP, Philip Davies, defended the BBC's decision, saying it had a duty to play the song on its chart show. He said: 'It's a chart programme so if . it's top of the charts they have to play it. It's not for the BBC to . define on what basis something is in the charts. 'However I think this whole campaign . is pretty pathetic really if the best these Left-wingers can achieve in . their lives is to campaign for a song. Compared to Lady Thatcher's . achievements around the world, it just shows what a fantastic Prime . Minister she was that she defeated these people time and again and they . are still bitter about it.' In 1977 the BBC refused to play the . Sex Pistols' anti-monarchy song God Save the Queen during the Silver . Jubilee celebrations. It reached number one in the NME music magazine . chart, but only number 2 in the official singles chart – selling 150,000 . copies in its first week. Yesterday BBC officials officially . said no decision had yet been taken on whether to play Ding Dong! on the . chart show.

Deputies say they received a 911 call . from the home in Terrytown, Louisiana on Sunday afternoon saying the girl had been found unconscious on the bathroom floor. Paramedics found the girl unresponsive and she . was pronounced dead a short time later. Armstrong was arrested on Tuesday after a coroner investigation found the girl died of multiple injuries, two days after the death, Jefferson Parish Sheriff's spokesman Col. John Fortunato said. Detectives initially spoke with the girl's mother, Adlourdes Desvallons, 39, and found out that the teenager had been babysitting while she went to the store, Fortunato told The Times-Picayune. Devalon told investigators the girl had a stomach ache and went upstairs to brush her teeth, and 30 minutes later he found her on the floor complaining her stomach still hurt, Fortunato said. Scene: The little girl suffered the beating in this Louisiana neighborhood while her half-brother babysat her . The teenager claimed he took the girl downstairs to the sofa and called 911 when he saw she was no longer breathing. Dispatchers told him to start CPR and paramedics arrived on the scene. The coroner's office said there did not appear to be any outward signs of injury and her death was left as unclassified, but on Monday, Devalon told detectives he had been practicing World Wrestling Entertainment-style moves on the girl,  The Times-Picayune reported. He said that even when his little half sister said she was in pain, he continued to carry out the moves on her. Detectives added that he appeared to be enjoying talking about the assault. The Sheriff's office has now classified her death as a homicide and Devalon was arrested on suspicion of second-degree murder and is being held at a juvenile detention center. Violent: The boy said he used moves on his sister like those he had seen on World Wrestling Entertainment . A probable cause hearing began in the case in Jefferson Parish juvenile court on Tuesday but was stopped after a defense attorney raised the issue of whether Devalon is mentally competent. Psychiatrists will now need to evaluate and recommend whether or not he is able to participate in his own defense. A hearing for his competency is scheduled for next month.","Viloude Louis was 'beaten by her half brother while their mother was out'

Infuriated customers: NPower boss Paul Massara told residents facing £1,500 bill to 'just use less' Millions of families are facing annual gas and electricity bills of more than £1,500 for the first time after a price hike by energy giant Npower. The German-owned supplier was accused of putting ‘profits before people’s lives’ after it announced the average dual fuel bill would rise by 10.4 per cent to an average of £1,491 per year. The hike means customers in four regions – London, South Wales, the South and parts of Scotland – will see their average bills top £1,500 a year, an all-time high. Npower – which was accused by MPs earlier this year of dodging tax – insisted the Government’s green taxes were largely to blame for the increase. But it did admit it wanted to increase its own profit margins – to 5p in the pound. Npower is the latest energy giant to raise prices, after British Gas announced a 9.2 per cent rise last week, and Scottish & Southern Energy an 8.2 per cent hike a week earlier. Yesterday the firm’s chief executive Paul Massara further infuriated customers when, in a video posted on YouTube, he defended the price hike. In it he pointed out: ‘It may be a cliche but it’s true: the cheapest unit of energy is always the one that isn’t used.’ He meant householders can protect themselves against rising tariffs by installing double glazing or loft insulation. But he was accused of patronising his customers – many of whom pointed out that they were already rationing their heat. Mr Massara’s personal Twitter feed is blocked to non-approved followers, but that did not stop people using the social media site to criticise him. One angry customer described his YouTube performace as ‘vomit inducing’. Earlier this year, MPs reacted with fury at Mr Massara’s defence of Npower’s failure to pay corporation tax. In evidence to Commons select ommittee, he admitted the firm paid no corporation tax in the three years 2009, 2010 and 2011 – despite making £750million over the period. He insisted it was legal and even desirable because it meant the firm could spend more money on ‘keeping the lights on’. Yesterday, Npower again defended its profit of about £64 per customer a year as ‘reasonable’. Scroll down for video . Controversial: Paul Massara delivers a message on YouTube advising customers to cut back on their energy usage as the company announced rises of up to 11.1 per cent from December . Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg issued a warning to energy firms, telling ITV’s The Agenda programme: ‘Profit is what drives a lot of these things but you can’t operate without public consent.’ Npower tried to shift the blame for higher energy bills by pointing to green taxes and eco schemes imposed by the Government, the cost of running the national grid of pipes and wires, as well as ‘the actual cost of buying energy’. But the wholesale price of gas – which makes up half of the bill – is up just three per cent compared with a year ago, which would only put up bills by 1.5per cent. In the video Mr Massara said: ‘This has been a really hard decision for us.’ How bills have soared: British Gas dual fuel energy bills have soared from £1,100 in 2010 to around £1,465 after the latest round of price hikes. Graph provided by MoneySuperMarket.com . In a blog, he added: ‘I know people . think energy companies are raking in huge profits at the expense of . customers, but this simply isn’t the case.’ The . official customer body, Consumer Futures, called for two inquiries to . establish whether the public are being ripped off – one into the . structure of the market and a second into green taxes. Energy . Secretary Ed Davey repeated the official government line that power . price rises are ‘disappointing’ and urged consumers to shop around. Clare . Welton of the Fuel Poverty Action Group said: ‘We need to acknowledge . the problem is the Big Six themselves: they will never priortise . people’s lives over their profits.’ Energy bills and on the way up - but you . could save up to £300 by switching. Providers offer their cheapest rates via online tariffs, . so if you're ready to switch, it will certainly pay to do so. But . suppliers tend to charge more for electricity to those customers who . live in their 'home' region - the areas where they enjoyed a monopoly . before energy deregulation. So switching away will almost always save . you money. Prices . are different all over the country and the cheapest supplier for you . will depend where you live. You only need to be interested in the tariff . that is going to be cheapest where you live, so do your own comparison . to find the best price.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 10:31 EST, 14 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 10:32 EST, 14 November 2013 . U.S. mobility for young adults has fallen to the lowest level in more than 50 years as cash-strapped 20-somethings shun home-buying and refrain from major moves in a weak job market. The new 2013 figures from the Census Bureau, which reversed earlier signs of recovery, underscore the impact of the sluggish economy on young people, many of them college graduates, whom demographers sometimes refer to as 'Generation Wait'. Burdened with college debt or toiling in low-wage jobs, they are delaying careers, marriage and having children. Jeremy Bills works as associate director at the Nashville Education Community and Arts Television office - he stayed in his college town while trying to unsuccessfully find a job in his field of study . Waiting anxiously for their lucky break, they are staying put and doubling up with roommates or living with parents, unable to make long-term plans or commit to buying a home - let alone pay a mortgage. Many understood after the 2007-2009 recession that times would be tough. But few say they expected to be in economic limbo more than four years later. 'I'm constantly looking for other jobs,' says Jeremy Bills, 27, of Nashville, Tennessee, who graduated from Vanderbilt University in May 2011 with a master's degree in human and organizational development. Originally from Tampa, Fla., Bills has stayed put in his college town in hopes of finding a job in management consulting or human resources. Instead, he has mostly found odd jobs like pulling weeds and dog-sitting. Bills says he pursued a master's degree to bolster his credentials after getting his college diploma in 2008, shortly before the financial meltdown. Chart shows mobility rate of young adults aged 25-29 . Instead, he finds himself still struggling financially and worrying that the skills he learned in school - where he incurred $20,000 in student loan debt - are 'kind of atrophying right now.' 'It's not like riding a bicycle. You can't just jump into a career position so many years after training,' said Bills, who now works at a nonprofit organization making $12 an hour and is looking for a second job. Among adults ages 25-29, just 4.9 million, or 23.3 per cent, moved in the 12 months ending March 2013. That's down from 24.6 per cent in the same period the year before. It was the lowest level since at least 1963. The peak of 36.7 percent came in 1965, during the nation's youth counterculture movement. The past year's decline in migration came after a modest increase from 2011 to 2012, a sign that young adults remain tentative about testing the job market in other cities. By metropolitan area, Portland, Ore., Austin, Texas, and Houston were among the top gainers in young adults, reflecting stronger local economies. Jeremy Bills is one example of millions who pursued a master's degree shortly before the financial meltdown - leaving him struggling to use the skills he paid for . Among college graduates 25 and older, Denver and Washington, D.C., topped the list of destinations. Demographers say the delays in traditional markers of adulthood - full-time careers and homeownership - may prove to be longer-lasting. Roughly 1 in 5 young adults ages 25 to 34 is now disconnected from work and school. 'Young adulthood has grown much more complex and protracted, with a huge number struggling to reach financial independence,' said Mark Mather, an associate vice president at the private Population Reference Bureau. 'Many will get there, but at much later ages than we've seen in the past. More and more we're seeing many young adults routinely wait until their 30s to leave the parental nest.' The overall decline in migration among young adults is being driven largely by a drop in local moves within a county, which fell to the lowest level on record. Out-of-state moves also fell, from 3.8 pe rcent in 2012 to 3.4 percent, but remained higher than a 2010 low of 3.2 percent. Young adults typically make long-distance moves to seek a new career, while those who make local moves often do so when buying a home. While homeownership across all age groups fell by 3 percentage points to 65 per cent from 2007 to 2012, the drop-off among adults 25-29 was much larger — more than 6 percentage points, from 40.6 percent to 34.3 per cent. Jeremy Bills says: 'It's not like riding a bicycle. You can't just jump into a career position so many years after training' That reflects in part tighter lines of credit after the 2006 housing bust. Declines in homeownership for those ages 40 and older over in that five-year period were more modest. The District of Columbia, with its high share of young adults, had the lowest homeownership rate across all age groups at 41.6 per cent, followed by New York at 53.9 per cent. West Virginia had the highest homeownership rate at 72.9 percent. In terms of births, the birth rate for all women of childbearing age - 63 births per 1,000 women — was essentially flat in 2012 from the year before. Meanwhile, overall migration among adults 55 and older held steady at 4.4 percent from 2012 to 2013, up from a low of 4 percent in 2011. Metro areas with the biggest gains included Phoenix, Atlanta, Denver and several in Florida. Many cities in the Northeast, Midwest and coastal areas posted losses. 'The post-recession period has given a bigger boost to seniors than to young adults in their willingness to try out new places for retirement,' said William H. Frey, a demographer at the Brookings Institution who analyzed the figures. 'Many young adults, especially those without college degrees, are still stuck in place.' 'For them, low mobility might be more than a temporary lull and could turn into the 'new normal'.' The wait continues for Eric Hall, 30, of Decatur, Ga. After picking up a master's degree in public health in 2008, Hall moved from California to the Atlanta suburb with the plan of living with his parents for about six months. Five years later, after struggling to find work in his field and switching his career path last year from health management to teaching kindergarten, Hall has opted to remain at his parents' home until he can pay off more debt. He is now studying to earn a doctorate in education, amassing college debt of more than $110,000. 'It's a bit restraining after going away to college two times, but I'm saving and my mom's been very understanding,' said Hall, who is optimistic he'll soon be financially stable enough to live on his own. 'Maybe next summer.'","2013 Census Bureau figures reversed earlier signs of recovery .

"By . Simon Parry . UPDATED: . 08:55 EST, 18 September 2011 . Pressure was growing on England rugby captain Mike Tindall last night after a criminal charge was levelled at a nightclub bouncer who blew the whistle on his evening out with a mystery blonde in New Zealand. Jonathan Dixon – who uploaded CCTV security video on to YouTube showing Zara Phillips’s husband kissing and cuddling the woman in Queenstown last Sunday – was arrested and charged with accessing a computer system for dishonest purposes. The arrest of the burly 40-year-old bouncer raises the prospect of a highly embarrassing court case in New Zealand that could overshadow England’s World Cup campaign. Ladies' man: Mike Tindall with rugby fan Janine Jefferis - who is not the girl in the CCTV images - just hours before he was caught on camera with a mystery blonde . Arrested: Bouncer Jonathon Dixon uploaded CCTV footage of Tindall cavorting with the blonde . Dixon told The Mail on Sunday that he . uploaded the footage from security computers at the Altitude bar because . he was outraged by Tindall’s ‘sleazy’ behaviour. Dixon was released on . bail and will reappear in court in Queenstown tomorrow morning. As well as a distraction for the . England team, Dixon’s court appearance could coincide uncomfortably with . Ms Phillips’s imminent arrival in New Zealand to support her husband in . the latter stages of the tournament. Dixon said last night: ‘If my case . goes to trial, I want Mike Tindall to appear in the witness box and . explain his actions that night.’ Tindall's father Phil said his son had spoken to him and reassured him that everything was okay. Mr Tindall said his son told him the woman involved in the bar incident was a good friend and that he was focusing on the rugby. 'It’s all just a fuss over nothing, which has only happened ­because of who Mike is married to.' he told the Sunday Mirror. 'I’ve seen the pictures and must say I don’t recognise the girl in the footage at all, but I’ve been told she’s a friend and I know nothing untoward would have happened.' Mr Tindall said his son made no mention of his new wife during their conversation. Meanwhile, fresh witnesses to . Tindall’s liaison with the blonde have revealed lurid new details of his . antics, which cast serious doubts over claims in Britain that Ms . Phillips is ‘relaxed’ about his account of the night out. A spokesman for Ms Phillips has . described the woman as a friend of the couple who has known Tindall . since university days and who was at their wedding in July. But the . Queen’s 30-year-old granddaughter struggled to put on a brave face as . she competed in a three-day equestrian event in Ireland this weekend. Despite the spokesman’s implication . that ¬Tindall was indulging in a spot of harmless horseplay with an old . pal, witnesses standing close to the couple in the Altitude bar . described his approach to her as ‘overtly sexual’. Tindall, 32, had been drinking with . other members of the England team in another bar last Sunday, the day . after their narrow victory over Argentina, before they arrived at the . Altitude. The captain had already posed for pictures with rugby fans, . including pretty Janine Jefferis, who is not the girl he was seen with . at the Altitude. There the players drank shots and . beers, surrounded by crowds of admirers including a number of young . women. The other team members gradually melted away, leaving Tindall, . the blonde and a female friend of the blonde near the nightclub bar at . around 1.30am. Of the other players, only veteran . hooker Steve Thompson remained, standing apart from Tindall and the . blonde, downing rounds with rugby-loving customers all too eager to buy . him drinks. Brave face: Tindall's wife Zara Phillips at the International Horse Trials in Ireland . Six security cameras around the club . picked up incriminating but soundless images of Tindall and the blonde . becoming increasingly intimate. Witnesses standing close to them said . the England captain’s intentions were clear. ‘There was no doubt what he was . after,’ said one witness. ‘At one stage he put his hand down the back of . her jeans. Then he put his hand up her top at the back, as if he was . trying to undo her bra strap.’ Tindall repeatedly tried to persuade . the blonde to leave the bar with him, the witness said. ‘He was trying . to drag her out of the door by the arm but she pulled free and said to . him jokingly, “You’re married.” ’ It was at this point that CCTV cameras . filmed the couple cuddling beside the doors before the woman pulled . Tindall towards her chest and kissed his shaved head. The witness said . the couple then kissed each other on the lips. The witness added: ‘He appeared a . little unsteady on his feet but he kept insisting and pulling on her . arm. She eventually gave in and walked out of the bar with him. Her . female friend followed behind.’ Tindall’s behaviour in the street . outside was even more mystifying for someone sup¬posedly enjoying the . company of a platonic friend. At the end of the silent video footage . of Tindall and the blonde posted on YouTube, the player can be seen . talking briefly to a passer-by outside the bar. A second witness told The Mail on . Sunday that the footage actually shows Tindall being confronted by a . male Australian tourist who recognised him and said: ‘You’re married. Pull your head in, mate.’ The witness said: ‘Someone, I’m not . sure if it was Tindall, said, “What goes on tour, stays on tour.” Tindall seemed to stumble forward towards the tourist before he was . quickly pulled away by the girl and her friend. ‘After that, Tindall and the blonde walked away from the bar with their arms around each other.’ The blonde’s friend was walking behind . as the couple left the Altitude at around 2am, but was nowhere to be . seen an hour later when a separate witness saw Tindall and the blonde . walk hand in hand past another bar about 500 yards away. ‘There was no . one else with them,’ the witness said. ‘I didn’t see where they went.’ Before reporting for a pre-arranged . interview at Queenstown police station yesterday, Dixon, who has worked . as a bouncer around New Zealand for 20 years, said that he had put the . CCTV footage on the internet partly because he believed Tindall’s . behaviour had insulted the Royal Family. Cosy: Mike Tindall is seen with his arm around the blonde woman in the grainy CCTV footage . ‘That kind of behaviour is completely . wrong,’ said Dixon, who was contacted by police after the owner of the . Altitude made a formal complaint about footage from its security cameras . being uploaded on to YouTube. ‘In New Zealand we have two national . anthems – God Defend New Zealand and God Save The Queen. The Queen is in . our national anthem and she is on our bank notes. She’s not just your . Queen – she’s our Queen too. This is the man who has just married the . Queen’s granddaughter and I thought his behaviour was sleazy.’ Dixon, who had been working at another . bar in Queenstown earlier last Sunday night, said he was called to the . Altitude at 11.30pm to ‘beef up’ security after the England team . arrived. He left at 1.30am and said he saw ‘nothing untoward’ in . Tindall’s behaviour up to that point, although he was with the blonde. It wasn’t until the next morning that he heard from amazed colleagues . that the couple had become intimate shortly after he left. Dixon said he obtained the CCTV . footage from the Altitude computer banks the next day. Later, he was . contacted by a British newspaper which published a story about the . episode without any of the footage. Dixon received no payment for the . article. Damning: A still from the CCTV footage showing Mike Tindall with a mystery blonde, which was posted on YouTube . Just good friends: The girl - seemingly kissing Tindall's forehead - is a friend of the couple and was at their wedding, a spokesman for Zara said . Early on Friday, keen to see the . footage aired, Dixon uploaded it on to YouTube, ensuring that it was . seen by millions of people worldwide within hours. In a foretaste of what he may argue at . his court case, Dixon said: ‘It’s not that I’m the most moral person in . the world, but I have a conscience and I was raised well, and I didn’t . like what I saw. Anyone who does this kind of thing when they’ve made . wedding vows in front of God should be ashamed of themselves. ‘I wanted to tell him, “Mr Tindall, you did something really wrong, not just to your wife but to your nation.” ‘I knew there was no chance of me ever . standing in front of Tindall and giving him a piece of my mind about . his conduct, so I decided to put it on YouTube so that everyone could . see it and form their own opinion. ‘I think that everyone who sees it . will think the same as I do: how can you do this? She’s your wife and . she’s the Queen’s granddaughter. If this had involved a Maori queen, she . would have cut off his head.’ Newlyweds: Mike and Zara on their wedding day in Edinburgh in July . Dixon scoffed at the claims that the . blonde was a friend of Tindall and Ms Phillips, saying: ‘If that’s true, . Zara should get rid of her friend. I wouldn’t have a friend like that, . and if she is a friend of hers, Zara is hanging around with the wrong . people. ‘What amazes me is that no one was . stopping Tindall. He’s the captain of the England team but no one was . keeping an eye on him. If I had seen anything going on, I would have . stopped him. I would have gone up to him and told him to watch himself. ‘I’ve heard that some British people who were in Queenstown that night saw him and they were disgusted at what they saw.’ Dixon, who is 6ft 6in tall and weighs . 19st 7lb compared with 6ft 1in Tindall’s 16st 9lb, added: ‘If the Queen . wants someone to give him a hiding, she should give me a call.’ The blonde seen with Tindall last . Sunday night is described by Ms Phillips’s spokesman as an English . friend living in Australia who was on holiday at the time of the . incident. She is now believed to be back in Australia..","Damning new witnesses accuse him of ‘overtly sexual’ behaviour .

The baseball star put his sprawling Miami mansion up for sale last year for $38 million, and he and girlfriend Torrie Wilson were later spotted hunting for a new love nest in Beverly Hills. Last week it was claimed the third baseman had tested positive for a banned substance in 2006 - but the results were never disclosed because a Major League player must fail two drug tests before his name is released. A-Rod's legal team denied the claims and accused senior baseball figures of leaking 'federally protected medical information' to win a legal battle with the 38-year-old. He is trying to overturn a 211-game ban imposed by Major League Baseball officials on him and 13 other players in August for allegedly violating doping rules. It is claimed the now-defunct Biogenesis of America clinic in Miami was the headquarters of a widespread South Florida doping ring which included Rodriguez. A-Rod denies wrongdoing and has sued MLB and its commissioner.

By studying cores of ice (like the one pictured), the researchers believe they could reveal why the Earth's atmosphere underwent a transition roughly one million years ago . Patches of Antarctic ice may unlock secrets about the earth up to one-and-a-half million years old, Swiss scientists have said. They hope a multi-million pound expedition to sample some of the ice will solve an ancient climate change mystery that continues to baffle experts. By studying cores of ice, the researchers believe they could reveal why the Earth’s atmosphere underwent a transition roughly one million years ago. Three kilometres under the Antarctic ice sheet are layers of compacted snow that fell up to one-and-half million years ago and trapped bubbles of the Earth’s atmosphere at the time. Scientists on the planned exhibition, which could cost in the region of £40million, would extract this natural log book by extracting an ice core between 2.4 and three km long from the Antarctic ice shelf. Experimental climate physicist, Professor Hubertus Fischer, at the University of Bern, Switzerland  said: 'The Mid Pleistocene Transition is a most important and enigmatic time interval in the more recent climate history of our planet. 'The Earth’s climate naturally varies between times of warming and periods of extreme cooling (ice ages) over thousands of years. 'Before the transition, the period of variation was about 41,000 years while afterwards it became 100,000 years. The reason for this change is not known.' Using tried and tested techniques, the scientists plan to drill deep into the shelf to access the oldest layers of ice. Professor Fischer said: 'Ice cores contain little air bubbles and thus represent the only direct archive of the composition of the past atmosphere. A previous expedition in 2003 managed to extract ice 800,000 years old at a site called Dome C, but Professor Fischer and colleagues hope to nearly double that in the near future. The deeper scientists drill into the ice, the more difficult it gets to retrieve an accurate sample. The beginnings of a bore hole in ice is pictured . 'The information on greenhouse-gas concentrations at that time can only be gained from an Antarctic ice core covering the last 1.5 million years . 'Such an ice core does not exist yet, but ice of that age should be in principle hidden in the Antarctic ice sheet.' A previous expedition in 2003 managed to extract ice 800,000 years old at a site called Dome C, but Professor Fischer and colleagues hope to nearly double that in the near future. However, the deeper scientists drill into the ice, the more difficult it gets to retrieve an accurate sample. Professor Fischer explained: 'If the ice thickness is too high, the old ice at the bottom is getting so warm by geothermal heating that it is melted away. 'This is what happens at Dome C and limits its age to 800,000 years.' Scientists are planning an expedition to Antarctica (pictured) in three to five year's time. They are currently focusing on raising funding for the trip which could cost around £40million, and working out where to drill to collect the ice core . Furthermore, horizontal movement in the ice can cause the very bottom annual layers to mix up. In their search to find the ideal site, Professor Fischer and his team at the university, combined data to identify possible drill sites. Eric Wolff, co-author of the study which is published in Climate of the Past, of the British Antarctic Survey, said: 'To constrain the possible locations where such 1.5 million-year old - and in terms of its layering undisturbed - ice could be found in Antarctica, we compiled the available data on climate and ice conditions in the Antarctic and used a simple ice and heat flow model to locate larger areas where such old ice may exist.' The team plan to survey the sites on the ground before choosing their deep drill location. Professor Fischer said: 'A deep drilling project in Antarctica could commence within the next 3-5 years. 'This time would also be needed to plan the drilling logistically and create the funding for such an exciting large-scale international research project, which would cost around 50 million Euros.'","Scientists from University of Bern, Switzerland, are planning an expedition to Antarctica for three to five year's time that could cost around £40million .

"By . Lee Moran . UPDATED: . 07:06 EST, 11 December 2011 . Google has been accused of compromising U.S. national security - by allowing aerial shots of secret military bases to be viewed by the general public through its online Maps computer program. The search engine giant has come under fire after web users found once again that they can search for military bases, and then zoom in to see airstrips and possible top-secret military drones. The discovery of a hidden airstrip at Yucca Lake in Nevada, which is used for testing the R-170 drones similar to the one lost in Iran last week, has raised further concern. Discovery: The Yucca Lake airstrip sits deep inside the heavily restricted Tonopah Test Range, but is now easily seen on Google Maps . Cedric Leighton, a retired Air Force colonel, said: 'Iranians would be most interested in operational bases because that tells them how we fly our surveillance missions. 'Google is making public what was once the sole province of the military and intelligence community, making this a brave new world for the intel agencies as well,' he told FoxNews.com. Aviation website Flight Global claimed to have discovered the secret Yukka Lake venue, which shows satellite images of either a Predator or Reaper drone on the airstrip. It said: 'The satellite image, taken in early 2011 and available on Google Maps, appears to show a roughly 5,200 ft asphalt runway and what appears to be a General Atomics MQ-1 Predator or MQ-9 Reaper UAV being towed on the parking ramp. 'The airfield has four hangars of varying sizes, including a hangar with clamshell doors that is characteristic of US UAV operations. 'Details of the airfield, including a parking lot, security perimeter and ongoing construction are clearly visible.' Spying on the spies: What looks like a drone (circled) sits on the Yucca Lake airstrip, as seen by Google Maps . The detail makes it extremely easy for foreign powers to look up satellite images to inspect secret U.S. spy planes. The website added that an earlier image, showing what appear to be a Pilatus PC-12 and Beechcraft King Air parked on the ramp, 'fuelled speculation' it was used by defence firm Lockheed Martin. Leighton added that he believed Google had the right to show the images to the public, but they should decide not to because they comprise military operations. He added that the U.S. military had previously blocked Google employees from taking images at bases for Google Earth, which requires more close-up photography. The publication of satellite imagery of top secret bases is a hot topic, with previous discoveries revealing the exact location of one in Denver. And in Pakistan's Balochistan province, crystal clear photographs showed Predator drones sitting on a parking ramp at Shamsi Airfield. Dr. John Michener, chief scientist at security firm Casaba, said Google should be allowed to show spy plane imagery as national laws do not apply above the atmosphere. He said: 'Get used to it. You know when the satellites are overhead. You can take countermeasures to hide portable stuff.' He added that it would become problematic if the government started filtering through 'deep-packet inspections', which would mean inserting code onto the web that would block access to secret images, and that Google could then start encrypting its images.","Aviation website 'finds' secret base used for testing stealth drones .

Miss Coleman and Sailor are pictured left on the day the baby was born. Sailor is pictured right at a later date . 'I am giving you the opportunity. Make the best of this opportunity, if nothing else, to honor your daughter’s memory,' Judge Walker told Kuhn at his sentencing on Tuesday, according to the Cortez Journal. The defense attorneys argued that given Kuhn's good-standing record, the judge should be lenient. The judge agreed that long prison sentences cause criminals to repeat their offenses more often, rather than deter them. The maximum sentence would have been four years in prison. Kuhn admitted to prosecutors that after a night of Halloween revelry, he aggressively put his six-month-old daughter to bed. She had been crying and he was frustrated, he said, so he 'told her to shut up' and slammed her on the mattress. Later, she was found dead. Happy: The defense attorneys argued that given Kuhn's good-standing record, the judge should be lenient . Father: Kuhn admitted to prosecutors that after a night of Halloween revelry, he aggressively put his six-month-old daughter to bed . A medical examiner declared that the child died of trauma related to being banged against a soft, but unyielding surface. 'It's disturbing to see a judge sentence someone who admits causing a child's death to a sentence you see in misdemeanor cases, reckless driving cases,' Stephanie Villafuerte, executive director of the Denver-based Rocky Mountain Children's Law Center, said to the Denver Post. 'I am giving you the opportunity. Make . the best of this opportunity, if nothing else, to honor your daughter’s . memory.' Judge Walker . 'It's very concerning the little value placed on this child's life.' But the case is more complicated than the sentencing, as defenders pleaded for leniency after a host of errors made by the prosecutors and their contention that the incident was an accident. 'There are people who are so dangerous that they need to be locked in a cage; Dylan is not one of those people,' Kuhn's attorney, John Moran said. 'He has apologized to anyone who will listen.' When Kuhn was first interviewed by prosecutors, a video of the event showed Kuhn crying through the entire tape. He first told them that the baby had fallen off the couch, but changed his story after being told the evidence did not support his claim. Mother: April Coleman spoke in Kuhn's defense at the sentencing, saying that he loved his daughter and it was an accident . Influence: At the sentencing, it appears the judge was swayed by the emotional testimony of Kuhn's family. April Coleman and Dylan Kuhn are pictured . 'I didn’t mean to hurt her,' he said in the taped interview. 'I did put her in her bed too hard.' He then asked for an attorney, saying that he was too young to understand the gravity of the situation. Before his trial, the prosecutors also failed to hand over evidence to the defense with appropriate time for them to asses their contents, which may or may not have proven Kuhn's innocence. The defense demanded the charges be dismissed, but a plea deal was struck in which Kuhn plead guilty to manslaughter and a charge of child abuse was dropped. Sorrow: 'I was told I was too young to raise her, and that turned out to be true,' Kuhn said after his sentencing . Prosecutors were hoping Kuhn would be sentenced to the maximum penalty. 'These are the reasons the people are asking for the maximum,' District Attorney Russell Wasley said. 'Nothing can restore the (life) of this baby. In the end he is not suitable for probation.' At the sentencing, it appears the judge was swayed by the emotional testimony of Kuhn's family. 'I am so worried that if you send him away he will shut down,' Kuhn’s mother, Vicki Espinoza, said. 'I don’t know why it went this far. It was an accident.' She said that Sailor was her son's life and that he has been destroyed by the tragedy. He still lives with the mother of the baby, April Coleman. 'He loved Sailor,' Miss Coleman told the court. 'The times I observed him with Sailor he was great. I am not exactly sure what happened here.' Judge Walker also sentenced Kuhn to mental health and substance evaluation and treatment and ordered him not to be allowed to be alone with children under the age of 10, court costs and possible restitution. After being sentenced, an emotional Kuhn spoke to the court. 'I loved my daughter very much. I am very sorry. I was told I was too young to raise her, and that turned out to be true,' he said, weeping. 'I am sorry to everyone.

A Florida inmate, sentenced to death for raping and murdering an aspiring artist in 1991, was executed this evening. Darius Kimbrough, who was 18 when he broke into Denise Collins' apartment and assaulted her as she slept, was pronounced dead at 6.18pm after being given a lethal injection. In the hours before his execution - the second in Florida using a new lethal cocktail of drugs - Kimbrough was visited by family and friends. The 40-year-old, who was convicted in 1994 for the brutal attack, requested a final meal of fatty foods, most of which he ate before 9.45am. His final meal request included two slices of pizza, fried green tomatoes, fried chicken, chicken gizzards, chocolate chip ice cream and fruit punch. His mother, a chaplain, three aunts and a cousin were among his final visitors, Department of Corrections spokeswoman Jessica Cary told the Orlando Sentinel. Kimbrough had spent nearly 19 years on death row after being convicted of first-degree murder, sexual battery and burglary. He was convicted of the attack on 28-year-old Miss Collins after DNA from a rape he committed five months later was matched to evidence found in her apartment. Kimbrough was found guilty of climbing into Miss Collins' second-floor apartment and attacking her in the bedroom. Her jaw and skull were broken in the vicious attack and she died in hospital the following day, when life support equipment was turned off. Scroll down for video . Last meal: Kimbrough requested pizza, fried chicken and ice cream in the hours before his execution at Florida State Prison . Relatives of Miss Collins attended the execution.

'She didn't go out that way, and he doesn't deserve what he's getting. He should go out the way she did. That's how we feel,' she told CBS News before Kimbrough was executed. Ms Stewart remembered her daughter, who had a fine arts degree, as being 'big-hearted, out going and laid back'. Kimbrough was the second Florida death row inmate to be executed using a new combination of lethal drugs. He was not a plaintiff in a lawsuit by other inmates who have argued that the new injection should be halted as unconstitutional.","Darius Kimbrough given new combination of lethal injection after 19 years on Florida's death row .

A 100-year-old widower killed himself after he could no longer surf the internet because he was going blind, an inquest has heard. Gordon Crisp's relatives bought him a laptop when he was struggling to cope with his wife's death in 2007. He enjoyed watching online videos of opera and jazz performance - but after he developed macular degeneration, it became increasingly difficult for him to use the computer. On December 29, Mr Crisp was found dead by his son-in-law on the floor of his bedroom at his home in Keynsham, Somerset. Opera: A music lover has hanged himself after his eyesight became too bad to watch online videos (file photo) Dr Peter Harrowing, assistant deputy coroner for Avon, said: 'They bought him a laptop computer and aged 95 he was taught how to surf the internet. 'He spent many hours surfing the net finding clips of opera and jazz. 'He developed macular degeneration affecting his eyesight which meant he could no longer use the computer which had given him so much enjoyment.' Son-in-law Cameron Hughes told the inquest in Flax Bourton, Somerset: 'Gordon was a proud man who struggled to allow people to do the day-to-day tasks. 'I had no idea he wanted to take his life but I was aware he was struggling with day-to-day life. 'I saw the milk on the doorstep and the post in the holder, and I was instantly alarmed. 'I pushed the bedroom door and it was heavy to move, and I was shocked to see Gordon behind the door. I was sure he had passed away.' Suicide: Gordon Crisp was found dead by his son-in-law at his home in Keynsham, Somerset (pictured) A report from his doctor confirmed that the retired engineer had glaucoma and impaired vision and suffered from 'bereavement issues' when his wife died. Mr Crisp's daughter Kathleen Llewellyn told the inquest: 'He was a very independent man and never wanted to be a burden to anyone. 'I know when his sight failed it was a concern for him, he always wanted to stay in his own home and didn't want a carer.' 'He probably decided he didn't wish to be a burden and felt this was an appropriate way out. ' Dr Harrowing returned a verdict of suicide, saying: 'Mr Crisp took deliberate steps at a time when he was unlikely to be disturbed and knew when taking the action his death would ensue. 'We will never know why he took the actions he did but we have heard he obviously missed his wife of many years.

The Speaker has taken action to curb excessive drinking at the Commons after Labour MP Eric Joyce assaulted colleagues in a Westminster bar. Waiters are now told to top up glasses less frequently and provide more non-alcoholic drinks. But radical plans to tackle consumption among parliamentary staff – by banning drinking at work – have now been scrapped by Commons managers. Speaker John Bercow's plans to ban drinking in Westminster have been rejected by Commons staff . In stormy meetings, rank-and-file workers complained the ban would not apply to MPs, saying: ‘Staff are being penalised because of the actions of drunk MPs.’ The ban is now set to be replaced by a ‘voluntary’ policy stating that drinking at work should be allowed only  in exceptional circumstances. However, Commons managers insist that the Westminster drinking culture is not confined to MPs. According to records of a series of staff meetings in June, Commons doctor Ira Madan specifically raised the alarm over drinking levels. Disgraced: John Bercow announced his intentions to ban drinking in Westminster after Labour MP Eric Joyce assaulted a colleague in a Commons bar earlier this year . The minutes read: ‘The House Doctor is concerned  at the proportion of staff  she sees who have alcohol-related problems.’ Commons managers later concluded: ‘There is a culture of drinking in some parts of the House service.’ Last night Mr Bercow declined to comment on the alcohol ban retreat.

Depression has often been described as the black dog, but now one artist has taken a very different approach in visualising mental illness. Toby Allen, a Cornish artist, has imagined what eight common mental illnesses would look like if they were monsters. He drew what he believed anxiety, depression, schizophrenia, social anxiety, avoidant personality disorder, borderline personality disorder, paranoia and dissociative identity disorder would look like as monsters. Mr Allen's Depression monster is designed as one that floats around endlessly with its eyes covered to hide itself from the world. This monster wraps its liquid tail around its victim to share its depression with them . Mr Allen said: ‘The artwork is not at all intended to make light of these conditions but instead is intended to give these intangible mental illnesses some substance and make them appear more beatable as physical entities.’ He told Suvudo he hopes the drawings will help to reduce the stigma around mental illness and that they will help bring an element of humour and understanding to the conditions. Mr Allen says he started by designing the Anxiety monster as anxiety is something familiar to him meaning he found the design came naturally. He says he designed the monster to be small enough to sit on the victim's shoulder and whisper things in their ear. He explained that he made the monster a dark colour to reflect the oppressive feeling he associates with anxiety. His Social Anxiety monster has pale anaemic-looking skin because it spends most of its life underground. Mr Allen says he started by designing the Anxiety monster as anxiety is something familiar to him meaning he found the design came naturally . The Avoidant Personality Disorder monster is similar to the Social Anxiety monster except that it prefers to live above ground, mainly hiding in trees.

'There were pieces that had gussets, scooped out busts to . allow for your own bra – and numerous images of black bras with a nude . bicycle short and suspenders on top,' she recalled.

'When you catch a glimpse of yourself in . the mirror I want you to like what you see,' she says. And . it seems the appeal of dMondaine has gone beyond the A-list. Already, . Ms Anvaripour's shapewear is being stocked by Neiman Marcus, Barneys and Net-a-porter.com - and customers can't get enough. The Jane bra, a feature of several items in the dMondaine range, has . been nicknamed 'the boob job in a bra' by fans. It was sported by .

'It truly shocks them because not only are they feeling sexy and shaped . without a wire, but they are able to wear the bra even after they have . finished nursing and back to their original size,' the designer says. The Lana high-waisted brief has also won enthusiastic responses. 'Recently . I woke up to an email from a . major UK retailer asking for a special order of 60 of our Lana . high-waisted brief,' she said. 'The order was for a customer who had . tried the Lana and . fell in love with them so much that she ordered 60 for herself!' Under where?

'Some women want to wear the Marilyn Contouring Slip . out on its own with nothing over the top, and many have!' As for herself, the designer says she lives in the bras and bodysuits, particularly 'for sheer blouses I . can't button up fully and to feel confident in jeans when my pesky . muffin top is showing!' Putting it to the test: FEMAIL was curious to know if dMondaine could genuinely deliver something new to shapewear fans . At 5ft 4in and a U.S. size 6, I . can usually benefit from shapewear beneath my more body-conscious . clothes. Spanx is my go-to, but I was curious to know if dMondaine could . genuinely deliver something new to shapewear fans, who are inundated . with a new 'miracle' product on an almost daily basis. I . was sent the Marilyn - dMondaine's signature piece - to road-test. It . is a full-body garment that looks like a rather short, tight, . cleavage-baring minidress. Getting . into it was straightforward. It has a zip at the back, and once I'd . wiggled it up, my less-than-toned midriff instantly looked more . streamlined. My . concern, though, was the built-in bra, usually something I avoid as I . usually require more serious support. But Kiana says that the dMondaine . designs fit every size, and can be worn by anyone with or without a bra. In the interests of research, I initially tried the Marilyn without. But while it definitely had a 'boob job effect', I felt too unsupported . to go without a bra, so ended up wearing it as well as the slip. My . clingy leather/wool pencil skirt, I felt, would be the toughest . challenge for the dMondaine - it is gorgeous, but unforgiving on my . gym-phobic body. Perhaps this would be the key to making it more of a . wardrobe staple. The result? The usually tight skirt was verging on loose - I was astonished. I felt . like I'd lost a couple of inches from my waistline. Result! In . terms of comfort, the dMondaine fared well too. It's not as comfortable . as wearing no shapewear at all, but distinctly more forgiving than any . other shapewear I've worn. That first day I wore it through several . meetings and an awards do - it didn't feel restrictive after eating and I . wasn't itching to take it off at the end of the night. The . verdict? I loved the dMondaine, but it's pricey at $169. The closest . Spanx equivalent is the Slimplicity open-bust full slip, at $88.

Royal Descent by Black Hearted Press has been slammed as 'sick' by critics for its violent representation of Royal characters . A Scottish publishing house has produced what has been described as the UK's 'most controversial comic' in which characters based on the Royal Family fight to the death in front of an audience. Royal Descent, by Glasgow-based Black Hearted Press, graphically depicts how the characters must kill each other in order to win the game. The first part of the trilogy which will be released next month, has been slammed by comic fans with critics describing its content as 'sick'. With striking similarities to fiction series the Hunger Games, and Japanese film, Battle Royale, Royal Descent sees its characters banished to a remote island in the Outer Hebrides. There, Princes Willard and Hadley fight to the death alongside characters such as Catherine, Duchess of Oxford and Prince Cedric. Though the team behind the work admitted changing characters' names to avoid being in 'poor taste',  it is plain to see where they drew inspiration. Characters such as Queen Eleanora II and Princess Agatha Princess, for example, seem to bear a striking resemblance to real-life royals, Queen Elizabeth and Princess Anne. The action begins in the wake of an environmental disaster in which a BSE outbreak causes the death of all livestock in Britain. In protest, the public banishes the Royals to the island where their fight for survival is broadcast on television. In order to escape the remote island's prison, the characters fight individually and are separated into heroes and villains. One particularly controversial storyline concerns a violent conflict between Prince Willard and Prince Hadley. While the former tries to make his way off the island, Prince Hadley is hell bent on taking revenge against members of the family he believes were complicit in his mother's death. A violent scene in which Princess Agatha attacks Princess Betina who bears a striking resemblance to Princess Beatrice . A page from the comic depicts Prince Hudley speaking to television presenters who are watching the action (left) and detail of the weapons given to characters to fight off opponents are discussed (right) The comic includes life-like representations of people linked to the Royal Family . The publication has been slammed by enthusiasts who deem its content distasteful. The story begins with the announcement of an outbreak of disease which has killed all of Britain's livestock . One writer who wished to remain anonymous said: 'There is no way the British people would allow this to happen. Why waste . your time on a book that no one wants to read? Horrible idea.' Another said: 'I hope they lock you up and throw away the key, the worst kind of sensationalist crap!' Writers at Black Heart Press admitted the work was controversial but described it as: 'a blackly comic and disturbing look at modern media, class and privilege. One of its creators, John Farman said: 'I personally believe this is possibly the most controversial comic book to ever come out of the United Kingdom. 'In the British tradition of storytelling there is a sense of satire and it’s in line with that'. Artist John Howard said: 'We’ve gone for analogues rather than accuracy. The Royals in the book are ordinary people with a slightly more heroic proportion. 'Besides the biographical newspaper strips that have marked anniversaries in the media, this is the first depiction of the Royals in a futuristic, dramatic and perilous setting.' Mr Farman added: 'I remind people that this is a comic and that I deal with fantasy. 'I’ve had some negative reactions, which I think is interesting. But with that kind of feedback, I feel I’m doing my job. Striking resemblance: The comic bears many similarities to the films Battle Royale (left) and The Hunger Games (right) 'I think it’s very important to . understand that with such a controversial subject matter that criticism . is totally valid, in the same way criticism of a film or novel is . totally valid.' A spokeswoman for the Royal Family said: 'We do not comment on books or articles about the Royal Family.' The first part of the comic trilogy will be released on 6 November.","Futuristic comic depicts deadly fight between characters such as 'Queen Eleanora II' and 'Prince Hudley'

A man has been arrested after allegedly confessing to exposing hundreds of former lovers to HIV. David Lee Mangum is thought to have had unprotected sex with around 300 people without telling them he had tested positive to the deadly virus. Police detained the 36-year-old, from Dexter, Missouri, after his former gay lover, who he met through a Craigslist advert, contracted the disease in July. Accused: David Mangum, pictured, told authorities he had sexual contact with as many 300 people since being diagnosed with HIV . Shortly after their brief relationship ended, the alleged victim received a phone call from one of Mangum's former roommates alerting him to the fact Mangum had tested positive for HIV in 2003, a Dexter Daily Statesman said. Mangum is said to have told police that he frequently knew little more than the first names of his partners which is complicating . efforts to notify potential victims. Under Missouri law, knowingly exposing . another person to HIV is a felony. Charged: David Mangum, from Dexter, Missouri, pictured, pleaded not guilty to infecting another man with the virus . If the victim goes on to become . infected with the virus - which leads to progressive failure of the immune system allowing life-threatening infections and cancers to thrive - the accused faces a possible sentence of life . in prison. 'Mangum admitted he never disclosed he had HIV to any of his sexual partners in Stoddard County,' according to a criminal affidavit reported by the Daily News. Mangum is alleged to have told officers investigating the allegations that he did not tell sexual partners about his infection because he feared being rejected. Judge Stephen Mitchell has set an all-cash bail of $250,000 in the case, and while awaiting trial, Mangum remains locked up at Stoddard County Jail.","Told police he feared rejection if he told partners he had HIV .

The universal credit scheme is a disaster waiting to happen, a Cabinet minister has warned. The initiative, which is the centrepiece of David Cameron’s welfare reforms, is due to begin with a pilot scheme in April and a national roll-out in October. Aimed at making it pay to return to work, the single benefit will replace a raft of unemployment and in-work handouts. Heading for disaster: David Cameron's new benefits reforms are losing support in the Cabinet . But senior figures, including Chancellor George Osborne, have become increasingly concerned about whether the computer software needed for the £2billion project is on schedule. One Cabinet minister was yesterday reported to have told friends: ‘The information technology for the new system is nowhere near ready. It’s a disaster waiting to happen.’ And Whitehall sources have confirmed the scheme has been put on the Treasury’s ‘watch-list’ of projects deemed to pose a significant risk. Any problems would be embarrassing for the Prime Minister, who placed welfare reform at the centre of his new year message yesterday. Work boost: The aim of the new benefits system is to encourage unemployed to get back to work . He said: ‘When people say we’ve got to stop our welfare reforms because somehow it is cruel to expect people to work, we are saying “No”. 'Getting people into good jobs is absolutely vital, not just for them, but for all of us. 'And when there is a fight on our hands to change our schools, we are ready and willing to have it because having a world-class education is the only way our children are going to get on in this world.’ Concerned: Chancellor George Osborne . Mr Cameron said the Coalition had ‘inherited a welfare system that was frankly out of shape, that paid people not to work’ – the problem the universal credit scheme is designed to solve. Whitehall concern about universal credit centres on a vast IT system developed with HM Revenue and Customs, which is meant to give officials up-to-date data on an individual’s income. The Department for Work and Pensions insists that early trials are encouraging but there are grave concerns elsewhere in Whitehall about whether it is ready to be rolled out to the entire country. A source pointed out that Mr Osborne had included funding for the scheme in this month’s autumn statement on the economy. The Chancellor supports the principle of the scheme but is said to be alarmed by the possibility of significant problems with such a high profile scheme affecting so many people in the run-up to the next election. A spokesperson for the Department for Work and Pensions denied the scheme was in trouble, adding: ‘Universal Credit is on time and under budget. It will start to be rolled out nationally from October 2013, making three million households better off and ensuring work always pays.’","David Cameron's new benefits initiative 'set to fail'

The extraordinary moment a meteor exploded in the Earth's upper atmosphere has been accidentally captured by a U.S. photographer and designer. Michael K. Chung was photographing the 2013 Perseids Meteor Shower last week when he managed to record the rarely-seen event of a meteor breaking apart in the Earth's atmosphere. Initially the designer thought he had photographed a meteor explosion and the debris scattering during his time lapse sequence, but in fact he captured the rocky body being 'torn apart' in the upper atmosphere. 2013 Perseids Meteor Shower: Meteor Explosion from Michael Chung on Vimeo. Astronomer Daniel Fischer told Universe Today that Mr Chung captured: 'a persistent train after a Perseids fireball, being torn apart by upper atmosphere wind shear.' The meteor therefore did explode but did not leave debris behind. Instead it left an expanding ring of glowing hot gas called a 'persistent train'. The charged gas has been heated by compression caused by the meteor and sheds electrons, similar to how a neon sign works, according to Mr Chung. Meteors explode in this way relatively often but the events are not regularly documented. Michael K. Chung was photographing the 2013 Perseids Meteor Shower last week from his garden in California when he managed to record the unusual event of a meteor breaking apart in the Earth's atmosphere (pictured) He said the event probably lasted about 20 minutes as he was taking 20 second exposures every 22 seconds. Mr . Chung filmed the explosion using his Canon 7D 18 megapixel digital . single-lens reflex camera and zoomed in on the action to film the . explosion at 24 frames per second and 12 frames per second. He said he couldn't believe what he saw when processing the images of the Perseid meteor shower. Mr Chung said he took the video early in the morning on 12 August from his garden in Victorville, California. He said: 'The fade to white is not an edit - it is overexposure due to the sun . coming up. From what I can tell, the timelapse sequence of the explosion . and expanding debris span an actual time of approximately 20 minutes.' One astronomy expert who looked at the video confirmed it is legitimate. David Dickinson said: 'What cinches it for me is that the meteor was moving in the right direction for a Perseid...I see Perseus rising to the right, the plane of the Milky Way and Andromeda just above centre' The astronomer said he has witnessed several meteors that leave smoke trains in their wake, which he examines with binoculars.","Michael K.

Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants only permanent British residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care . Foreigners travelling to Britain to take advantage of our free health service will be denied treatment under radical plans for a shake-up of the system of personal NHS identification numbers. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt wants only permanent British residents to qualify for anything other than emergency care free of charge. He believes non-UK residents are granted NHS numbers – which entitle them to free care – far too easily. In many cases, anyone who turns up at a GP surgery is given a number. On referral to hospital, no further questions about their entitlement are asked – meaning that ‘health tourists’ or those who have fallen ill unexpectedly while in this country are given unlimited free access to the NHS, Government sources say. Mr Hunt said the system was ‘completely unacceptable’. He has proposed that in future, anyone with a ‘questionable’ residency status should be issued with only a temporary NHS number. It would mean that if they tried to access anything other than accident and emergency departments, they would be charged. ‘It is completely unacceptable that people are abusing the NHS and accessing free care they are not entitled to,’ the Health Secretary told the Daily Mail. ‘Changing the way the NHS number is used is just one stage of my plan to shut down free NHS care for those who are not entitled to it.’ It is expected that hospitals or surgeries would be under a new obligation to check whether patients are entitled to free care. They would be able to refer cases to a central body – probably NHS England – which would determine what should be charged. Sources said a consultation will determine the best way of requiring people to prove residency, possibly through council tax records or the electoral roll. The Government has promised a crackdown on health tourism, but until now it has been unclear how it would work. Unacceptable: Mr Hunt has proposed that in the future anyone with a questionable residency should be issued with a temporary NHS number . Ministers have also been criticised for underestimating the scale of the problem, with official statistics suggesting it costs taxpayers around £20million a year. But earlier this month the Mail revealed a senior doctor’s warning that the true cost is likely to run into billions of pounds. Professor J Meirion Thomas, consultant surgeon at the Royal Marsden Hospital in London, said the NHS had become the ‘world’s maternity wing’ as foreign expectant mothers arrive just to give birth. Thousands of others are flying here for cancer, HIV, kidney and infertility treatment then leaving without paying, he said. He cited one example of a foreign patient arriving in renal failure on a visitor’s visa and had 849 dialysis sessions on the NHS. He called for an overhaul of the system of NHS numbers, saying: ‘Those who work and pay tax here, and have a National Insurance number to prove it, ought to be granted full access to the NHS. ‘But it makes no sense to accord this right to visitors, especially when an NHS number can translate seamlessly into expensive long-term hospital care.’ Mr Hunt will unveil his proposals for an overhaul in a document on health tourism to be published in the next few months. Anyone whose chargeable status was in question would in future receive a number that only gives temporary access, for example if they needed lifesaving treatment. A Department of Health source said: ‘The system and processes we have in place to identify those who should pay are weak or poorly implemented. ‘Often, NHS numbers are allocated after a person registers at a GP practice, where current charging rules do not apply. On referral to secondary care with an NHS number, too often no further questions about entitlement are asked.’ Hospitals in England and Wales are supposed to ensure NHS patients have lived in the UK for the previous 12 months, and chase payment for non-emergency treatment from visitors. But dozens of hospital trusts admit they do not check.","Jeremy Hunt believes non-UK residents are granted NHS numbers too easily .

BBC Director General Lord Tony Hall has suggested staff working for the corporation should take second jobs . BBC staff should be encouraged to hold down second jobs while working full time for the corporation, the director general has announced. In a controversial response to recent scandals over multi-tasking executives, Tony Hall said employees should moonlight for other organisations to ‘find out about life outside’. But as it emerged Lord Hall has 11 outside positions on top of his £450,000 BBC role, critics accused him of failing to crack down on managers who earn lucrative second salaries. Quizzing him before the culture, media and sport committee, Tory MP John Whittingdale said it was ‘extraordinary’ that senior managers were allowed to top up their salaries by working extra hours. Others accused him of failing to exert the ‘firm hand of governance’ by cracking down on the problem. Earlier this year it emerged the BBC’s former technology chief John Linwood held down a £28,000 outside role while he was presiding over the failed £100million Digital Media Initiative, prompting accusations he had failed to concentrate on his day job. And last month, business controller Lisa Opie was found to be supplementing her £207,000 BBC income with a second job running her own café business. She kept a regular blog about the stresses of fitting calls around ‘proper job meetings’ and left work at 4.40pm to get back to the café in time. Lord Hall agreed her blog was ‘daft’, but refused to condemn her for juggling multiple roles. He said: ‘My position on this is I think it is good for people in the BBC to get involved in things outside the BBC, especially if it is for charity. 'I obviously do charitable contributions myself. It is important to have a perspective of what life is like outside.’ Labour MP Paul Farrelly said Lord . Hall should have ‘struck a much firmer tone’ on the issue, adding: ‘If . you are being paid a quarter of a million pounds by the BBC you should . be expected to work full time for the BBC, as in any other . organisation.’ Moonlighting: Lord Hall was accused of failing to crack down on senior BBC managers who earn lucrative second salaries . But Lord Hall replied: ‘No I haven’t [struck a firmer tone], for the reason I said. As I was careful to say it depends on the person, it depends on the job. 'I think people can learn a lot by being a non-exec on a charity or some other organisation which you then bring back into the BBC. 'I think that kind of fluidity and porousness between the BBC and other organisations is actually a very good thing.’ Pressed on Miss Opie’s case after the hearing, he said: ‘It was all done in her own time, and the manager concerned is absolutely certain she is concentrating on the day job, which is all I ask of somebody.’ Mr Whittingdale, who chairs the committee, said: ‘Nobody is saying you shouldn’t get involved in charities, but it is completely different when you have a highly remunerated job on top of your main role. 'If you are a member of senior management, you shouldn’t be earning extra money by taking on extra work outside the BBC.’","Tony Hall has 11 outside positions on top of his £450,000 BBC role .

Facing ruin: Carer Kumari Murphy has been ordered to pay auctioneer Nicholas Rayner £1.2m after she swindled almost £780,000 from him . A 'dictatorial' carer who swindled her auctioneer boss out of almost £780,000 is facing financial ruin after she was ordered to pay him back £1.2million. Kumari Murphy took advantage of Nicholas Rayner, the former boss of Sotheby’s Geneva branch, who famously orchestrated the 1987 sale of the Duchess of Windsor's gems. The celebrated auctioneer and former Army officer, had become increasingly dependent on Murphy, after his glittering career at the auction block was cut short by a devastating stroke. While caring for Mr Rayner, 'emotional bully' Murphy would frequently listen . in to telephone calls, isolated him from his family and monitored every . aspect of his life, while pocketing large sums in cash from her . vulnerable charge. She even persuading him to pay tens of thousands of pounds in school fees for a daughter she never had. Murphy, . 60, even claimed that she had been a 'wonderful' carer for Mr Rayner, . now 77, for more than 12 years before she was unceremoniously sacked. However, . Judge Jeremy Cousins QC found in April that she had cheated Mr Rayner . to the tune of almost £780,000 - as well as running up a staggering . £160,000 in bills for personal phone calls. The total she was ordered to repay Mr Rayner, with interest, came to more than £1.2 million. Today, . Murphy pleaded for mercy at London’s Appeal Court, insisting that she . had done her utmost for Mr Rayner, only to be left facing a life of . loneliness and poverty. However, Lord Justice Christopher Clarke dismissed her challenge as hopeless. The errant carer had insisted that Mr . Rayner had promised to maintain her for the rest of her life and that . his £2.3m Knightsbridge home, where they once lived together, should . rightfully be hers when he dies. Glittering career: Auctioneer Nicholas Rayner oversaw the 1987 sale of jewels belonging to the Duchess of Windsor, right, before his work was cut short by a stroke . In his original decision, Judge . Cousins said she was not due a penny after branding her a 'profoundly . unsatisfactory witness' who had done all she could to exploit Mr . Rayner’s vulnerability and fleece him of chunks of his fortune. Condemning . the maths lecturer for the 'excessive pressure, emotional blackmail or . bullying' she brought to bear on her frail charge the judge said her . claim that Mr Rayner had never paid her for her work was a bare-faced . lie. The auctioneer had a . devastating stroke in 1994 and, as he became more and more emotionally . dependent on Murphy, she 'encouraged' his isolation from his family and . friends and used her dominance over him to plunder him for money. She . had even convinced him to shell out tens of thousands of pounds in . ‘school fees’ for a young relative in Bangalore, who she had falsely . claimed was her daughter. Celebrated: The Duchess of Windsor's emerald, ruby and diamond 20th anniversary brooch, auctioned by Mr Rayner in 1987 . A Royal Haul: Staff at Sotheby's in Geneva with the Duchess's jewels prior to the 1987 auction . The judge said: 'There was dependence and vulnerability on his side, and ascendency, domination and control on hers.' Mr Rayner met his £400-a-week carer while she was doing voluntary work in his former home in Eaton Square in 1994. She said that he had made 'various promises to try to induce her to stay with him and look after him' and insisted that 'he owed his life' to her. Murphy claimed millionaire Mr Rayner had pledged she would be 'provided for for life' but, after a further stroke put him in hospital in 2008, his family began to suspect that the carer was 'seriously misappropriating Mr Rayner’s money on a considerable scale'. She swiftly found herself out of a job and evicted from Mr Rayner's home in exclusive Ennismore Gardens, Knightsbridge, London. Holding Mrs Murphy to account in . April, Judge Cousins found that, of the £1.2 million she had spent from . Mr Rayner’s fortune, less than £400,000 had been for his benefit. She had also run up £176,000 in telephone bills on his line, £160,000 of which were for her personal calls. Out of work: When Mr Rayner's family became suspicious that the carer was misappropriating his money, Murphy was evicted from his home in exclusive Ennismore Gardens in Knightsbridge . Murphy was in the Court of Appeal today as her niece, Veena Raj, made an impassioned plea on her behalf. She insisted that her aunt had not been given a fair hearing and had been honest in all her dealings with Mr Rayner. However, Lord Justice Clarke said that Judge Cousins had clearly disbelieved Murphy and it was not for him to re-decide the facts. He added that there was not a shred of evidence that Judge Cousins had been biased or prejudiced against her, nor that he had made up his mind before he heard the evidence. Paying tribute to Judge Cousins’ ‘careful analysis’ of the case, the Lord Justice Clarke told tearful Murphy that her challenge stood no reasonable prospect of success and refused to grant her permission to appeal. ﻿The Sotheby’s 1987 sale of the Duchess of Windsor’s collection, raised more than £33million, a world record for any single-owner jewellery collection.

A prison inmate who was once friends with accused Utah wife killer Dr. Martin MacNeill testified Wednesday that the former Mormon leader admitted while they were serving together at Texarkana Federal Prison that he drowned his wife. Inmate No. 1, as he was known to the court, told the jury that MacNeill 'said he had to help her out and said he held her head under the water for a while.' The damning revelation came just after another jailmate, Jason Poirier, told the court that MacNeill bragged that he 'can get away with a lot of things,' including murdering his wife. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Attorney Randy Spencer, right, questions Jason Poirier, a former inmate who served time with Martin MacNeill, a doctor accused of killing his wife. Poirier said MacNeill acknowledged the murder . 'He said he gave her some oxy and some sleeping pills, then got her to get in the bath tub,' Inmate No. 1 elaborated. McNeill was in jail at the time for identity fraud. He was released in July 2012. The two became friends while taking a prison computer class together, ABC News reports. And Inmate No. 1 made remarks about his wife's death on several occasions. 'He said she was in the way. She wanted the house and the kids,' said Inmate No. 1, who remains behind bars on drug and firearm convictions. Poirier testified that MacNeill told him: 'I'm . getting away with the murder of my wife.' The . testimony came as the trial in Provo, Utah resumed on Wednesday. MacNeill is accused of killing his wife Michele . in April 2007 so that he could be with his mistress. Poirier recounted his conversation with MacNeill in December 2012 . at Utah County jail, a few months after MacNeill's arrest in the death. Poirier, who was being held on suspicion of shoplifting at the time, told the court that the conversation started when he asked MacNeill how he was able to get away with wearing custom-made shoes in jail. On trial: MacNeill is accused of killing his wife with a lethal cocktail of drugs so he could continue an affair . He said MacNeill replied: 'I can get away with a lot of things. I'm getting away with the murder of my wife.' A few days later, Poirier said, he asked MacNeill if the remark had been serious. The doctor replied he was serious, threw up his arms and said, 'Look where I'm at,' Poirier claimed. Poirier took the stand under a limited . grant of immunity. Defense lawyers attacked Poirier's credibility by . getting him to acknowledge he thought he would avoid charges by . informing on MacNeill. Three other prison inmates testified on Tuesday that MacNeill regularly cursed his wife and bragged that investigators couldn't prove he killed her. One inmate said MacNeill referred to his wife as a 'b****' and that he said: 'If I did [kill her] they don't have any evidence.' Those inmates were from a federal prison in Texas where MacNeill was held on fraud charges. Prosecutors are now nearing the end of . their mostly circumstantial case against MacNeill and are expected to . wrap up their evidence on Wednesday.

David Davis said chief police officers can no longer be trusted to carry out major disciplinary investigations into officers . Chief police officers can no longer be trusted to carry out major disciplinary investigations into their own officers, former Tory Party Chairman David Davis said last night. Mr Davis, an ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, said revelations around the Plebgate scandal showed chief constables had failed to properly investigate their own juniors - and misconduct should be ‘taken out of their hands’. His comments came as the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would re-open its probe into a now infamous meeting between Mr Mitchell and three Police Federation representatives in October last year. The three officers met Mr Mitchell amid furore over claims he had called police officers ‘f****** plebs’ after they refused to let him cycle his bike through the Downing Street gates. The fallout from the incident resulted in his resignation a month later. Following the meeting, the three officers, Sergeant Chris Jones, Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Inspector Ken Mackaill told the media Mr Mitchell had ‘refused to elaborate’ on what happened during the altercation. A secret recording of the meeting, made by Mr Mitchell, showed he had provided a detailed account of what happened, but a misconduct probe cleared the three officers of lying. Yesterday a report by MPs said the evidence the three officers had provided to them at a public hearing last month was ‘misleading, possibly deliberately so, and lacking in credibility’. Their accounts were ‘contradictory, inconsistent and provided little or no insight into their actions’, the Home Affairs Select Committee concluded. The committee has told two of the officers, Sgt Jones and Det Sgt Hinton that they must appear before it again tomorrow and apologise or be in contempt of Parliament. At the same time, the Independent Police Complaints Commission said it would reopen its investigation into the meeting with Mr Mitchell, after it found ‘procedural irregularities’ in how the police handled it. Mr Davis said it was ‘astonishing’ and ‘deplorable’ that three chief constables had been prepared to ignore clear evidence more junior officers had not told the truth about a meeting with Mr Mitchell at the height of the scandal. When they appeared before the committee, the Chief Constable Andy Parker of Warwickshire, West Mercia chief David Shaw and Chris Sims from the West Midlands force all apologised to Mr Mitchell. But only Mr Shaw said he thought the disciplinary probe should be reopened. MPs on the committee said the officers had shown ‘an absence of leadership’ over the affair. Mr Davis told the Mail: ‘Truth is central to the judicial system so you expect the police to abide by that.’ The recording of the meeting proved that the three officers ‘weren’t telling the truth,‘ he said, and given that, it was ‘really worrying’ that disciplinary action had not been taken. He added: ‘For the chief constables of three important police forces to let it go is astonishing. I’m afraid it shows you cannot trust the Chief Constables at all to do this. ‘All complaints above a relatively trivial level should go to the IPCC and they should be equipped to carry them out, including the disciplinary hearings. ‘What we need is a core of untouchables to investigate anyone without fear or favour. That way the bad apples in the police will not be able to bring the others in to disrepute. ‘This will be welcomed by the vast majority of officers who are probably very unhappy about this.’ Ex-Conservative chairman Mr Davis, an ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell (pictured), said revelations around the Plebgate scandal showed chief constables had failed to properly investigate their own juniors . The scathing report by the committee accused the three Federation officers of ‘obstructing the truth’ when they appeared before its MPs last month. It said: ‘If evidence was given in a similar manner by three serving police officers to a court of law it is our view that such testimony would undermine a case and lead a jury to reach an unfavourable conclusion as to the credibility of the evidence given by those police officers.’ It criticised Det Sgt Hinton for referring to Home Secretary Theresa May as ‘that woman’ at the meeting, before claiming he was misquoted. IPCC deputy chairman Deborah Glass said there were ‘procedural irregularities’ between the production of a draft version of the disciplinary report and a final version that warranted further investigation. Miss Glass said the IPCC would conduct the investigation itself so public confidence was not eroded further. Committee chairman Keith Vaz said: ‘The narrative of what we have seen could rival any great work of fiction. ‘At every point and at every level, instead of being transparent, we have uncovered a process that obstructs the truth. If this can happen to a Cabinet minister, what hope is there for anyone else?’","Ally of former chief whip Andrew Mitchell, Mr Davis said Plebgate has shown chief constables have failed to properly investigate their own juniors .

Generous: David Cameron argued Britain has a 'moral obligation' to help the world's poorest . Just one in four people support Britain spending  billions of pounds on ­foreign aid every year.And more than 60 per cent believe the cash is wasted, according to a poll. The finding is a major blow to David Cameron, who is committed to protecting international development from budget cuts. It follows a spate of stories linking Britain's aid spending to corruption or waste. Spending on development by the Coalition is set to rise to £11.3billion next year. Only 6 per cent of people in the Ipsos-Mori poll strongly disagreed with the idea that foreign aid is wasted. A further 20 per cent tended to disagree with the statement. Together the total of 26 per cent is little more than a quarter of the public. But 61 per cent said that development money is being wasted. Despite the lack of support, Mr Cameron made a passionate defence of his target of spending 0.7 per cent of the UK's income on foreign aid. The decision will require an increase of 30 per cent in 2013 from £8.65billion this year. Mr Cameron acknowledged it was 'difficult' to persuade the public that increasing aid was the right thing to do at a time of cutbacks at home. But he insisted that the rise was in Britain's wider interests, as well as being morally right. He said: 'It can sometimes be a difficult argument, because we're having tough times here at home, we're having to make difficult decisions, but Britain is an incredibly generous country.' In Whitehall, a senior source said there was growing alarm among officials about the ability of the Department for International Development (Dfid) to manage next year's aid budget increase. There are fears the result will be a rise in waste and corruption. 'It's not so much the scale of the spending, but the pace it is being pushed through at,' the source said. 'There are real questions whether any department can safely handle such a rapid increase in spending.' But Mr Cameron said Britain had a 'moral obligation' to assist the poorest parts of the world and that specific programmes, such as those directed at tackling disease or child malnutrition, had tangible benefits. The Prime Minister added that it is in Britain's self-­interest to invest in nations such as Somalia 'to make sure countries don't break down and we don't suffer from problems of mass migration and pandemics, problems of climate change'. Repeated instances: The Daily Mail has reported on aid being wasted or used doubtfully . However, Mr Cameron acknowledged that aid can involve 'difficult decisions' as he explained the recent decision to wind down the £280million a year aid programme to India. The move followed public concern over the handout to a nation now wealthy enough to have its own space programme. He said: 'There does come a time when you have to recognise a country like India is becoming a middle-income country. 'While I know there are still very many very poor people in India, increasingly, the Indian government is investing money in poverty alleviation itself. 'What we should be doing is offering expertise and help, rather than money.' Self interest: The PM said without aid countries like Somalia could 'cause problems for us at home' The Mail has reported on repeated instances of aid being wasted or used doubtfully, including £30million sent to China – the world's second-largest economy – to plant trees, and £10million marked to combat poverty in Uganda ending up in private bank accounts. A further £270million set for Rwanda came under question  as criticism grew of President Paul Kagame. The payments are now suspended. The Independent Commission on Aid Impact warned recently in a report that plans for a vast hike in aid to Pakistan – which is set to become the biggest recipient of British money – should be  'approached cautiously'. 'We note that Dfid has no track record of delivering programmes in Pakistan on the scale that is now contemplated,' the report warned. Bobby Duffy of Ipsos-Mori said the strength of feeling revealed by the poll of 1,002 people showed politicians should be 'realistic about how far opinion can be shifted' on aid.","More than 60 per cent believe cash Britain gives to others is wasted .

"By . Peter Rugg . PUBLISHED: . 09:47 EST, 18 November 2012 . | . UPDATED: . 17:10 EST, 19 November 2012 . Police are on the hunt for a methodical serial killer responsible for at least three killings with the same .22 caliber handgun over the last four months. The .22 Caliber Killer's latest victim, a New . York City boutique owner was shot to death in the head Friday night with the same gun . that killed two other shopkeepers in the same borough over the summer. Ballistics tests matched in each killing, all of which occurred in Brooklyn shops with an '8' in the address. Suspect: Following one homicide at a 99 cent store that used the same gun, police released this sketch of the suspect . A sketch of the killer has been released after a witness told police he noticed a disturbed man at a previous victim's store just before a body was discovered, muttering to himself about putting a bullet in someone's head. He is said to be roughly 5-foot-5 and around 140 pounds. The Daily News reports that the shop owner Vahidipour Rahmatollah of Great Neck was behind the counter of She She in Brooklyn's . Flatbush section when he was shot Friday night. The gunman . dragged the victim's body toward the back of the store and covered it . with clothing. Murdered: Vahidipour Rahmatollah was killed with thre gunshots, but it seems nothing was stolen from his shot . Police found the 78-year-old with two gunshot wounds to the head and one to the torso, DNA Info reported. On the floor of the shop were the killer's calling card: shell casings matching casings left at the scenes of the last two homicides. 'Now it's like he's telling us, 'It's me again,'' a police source told the New York Daily News. casings that police have matched to two other murders. “Now it’s like he’s telling us, ‘It’s me again,’ ” a police source said. The way Rahmatollah's body was hidden was also consistent with the previous shootings. On July 6, Mohammed Gebeli, 65, was found shot through the neck in his Bay Ridge clothing shop. His body was also hidden. Police believe the methodical killer does this to buy himself more getaway time by delaying the discovery of the bodies. 'I hope they catch the son of a b****,' Gebeli's son, Mourad said. When Rahmoatollah didn't come home at the usual time Friday his family called the police, who discovered his body. It wasn't not clear if the killer actually took anything, or if the murder was his sole motivation. 'He never had in his whole life one enemy, he didn't have, he was a very . kind man,' his sobbing wife, Naima Rahmatollah, told reporters. Saturday he was supposed to be at his grandson’s Bar Mitzvah. Victims: Isaac Kadare and Mohammed Gebeli were killed by the same handgun earlier this year . Police believe the murderer had been . watching the store in preparation for the attack, noting that he'd . chosen a shop with no security cameras. Issac Kadare, 59, was found dead in his Bensonhurst store at 1877 . 86th St., was shot in the head and stabbed in the neck. Besides owning stores, each victim was of Middle Eastern descent, prompting suspicion the killer could be racially motivated. It appeared nothing was taken from Rahmatollah's shop but both Kadare and Gebeli had money taken from them, and it remains unclear whether robbery is a motive. Unguarded: believe the killer was attracted to the store because, as with previous crime scenes, there were no cameras . Fernando Mateo of the Bodega Association of the U.S. said they were sending copies of the police sketch to their members but were mostly concerned with those fitting the previous victim's description. 'The only members that we would be concerned about are Middle Easterners,' he said. It's also possible the killer has a fascination with numerology, as the address for each homicide includes the number 8: Kadare at 1877 86th St., Gebeli at 7718 5th Ave., and Rahmatollah at 834 Flatbush Ave. None of the stores had working surveillance cameras. Scene: Police believe the killer may have been casing the shop, as it had no security cameras to catch him in the act . Neighbors called Rahmoatollah a 'neighborhood staple.' 'He was a regular guy,' said customer Xanius Patterson. 'He never hurt nobody.' Police are offering $12,000 for any information leading to the killer's arrest and conviction.","Casings from the same .22 caliber handgun found at all three crime scenes .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 08:24 EST, 15 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:04 EST, 15 March 2013 . Amateur boxers are to be banned from wearing headgear in a bid to reduce the number of head injuries. While the move sounds counterintuitive, the theory is that opponents don't apply so much force if the head is unprotected. The new rules, from the International Boxing Association (AIBA), state that from June 1st, amateur, elite male boxers who compete internationally will be banned from wearing headgear, like their professional counterparts. Another reason for the move is that headgear can obscure peripheral vision, making it harder to see when a blow is being aimed at the side of the head. Indeed, research has shown that a lack of headgear actually reduces the risk of concussion. Protection: While the move sounds counterintuitive, the theory is that boxers won't hit their opponent's head so hard if it's not protected . In a statement, the AIBA said: 'All available data indicated that the removal of headguard in Elite Men . would result in a decreased number of concussions.' Although cuts will still be a risk, these will heal, as will bones - 'but if you can't recognise your grandchildren, it's a . disaster,' Charles Butler, chairman of the AIBA medical commission, told the Wall Street Journal. He has worked on research which formed the basis of the recommendations. He looked at research involving 15,000 boxers, half of whom had competed with headgear and half without. He found that in the 7,352 rounds that took place with boxers wearing headgear, the . rate of concussion was 0.38 per cent, compared with 0.17 per cent per boxer per round in . the 7,545 rounds without headgear. Amateur boxers have been required to wear headgear since the 1980s after concerns about concussion. But Mr Butler added that technology meant that gloves have also improved since then, helping to reduce the impact of blows to the head. But some experts have criticised the new guidance, adding that knockouts often come from hits to the chin. And the rules will remain unchanged . for women, the theory being that women may lack the strength to . administer blows strong enough to cause concussion. The AIBA announcement comes after new . research published in the British Journal of Sports Medicine found . there was 'no good evidence that mouthguards and helmets ward off . concussion'. Professional boxers such as Amir Khan (pictured here with Carlos Molina) do not wear headgear for this reason . The researchers agreed that while they can help ward off other serious head and facial . injuries,  there was 'no good evidence that they can help prevent . concussion, and paradoxically, they may even encourage players to take . greater risks'. The advice comes at a time of increasing evidence that even minor head injuries can be deadly in the long-term. Research published last week suggests that repeated, sub-concussive hits to the head are dangerous and are also linked to neurological disorders, such as multiple sclerosis, later in life. Scientists from the University of Rochester Medical Center say that the brain degeneration observed among professional football players may be due to something in their immune system spiralling out of control. This could be because it damages the blood-brain barrier - a 'gate' between the brain and bloodstream. When the barrier is working properly, it holds in proteins and molecules that bathe the brain and protect it from foreign substances. With blows to the head, however, the barrier opens slightly and allows some proteins to leak into the bloodstream and possibly attack the brain. Other recent research from the University of Texas has warned that heading a football could cause brain damage. They said that a header is classed as a 'minor sub-concussive blow' and have found that young people who play football are less able to perform tasks requiring basic thinking skills than those who avoid the game. Repeated blows to the head can lead to chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), where sufferers experience memory loss, dementia and depression.","New rules from International Boxing Association (AIBA) apply from June .

If Jeremy Paxman takes a razor to his beard in the next few days, don’t blame pognophobes at the BBC – vanity will probably get to him first. The Newsnight presenter revealed he thinks he now looks like Albert Steptoe and said he should probably shave it off if he wants to look his age. Writing in a Sunday newspaper, he said a friend had told him the beard made him look older, adding: ‘If you’re 63, this is not necessarily a good idea. ‘Wilfrid Brambell played Albert Steptoe when he was only 50, and it was the beard (now I come to think of it, not very dissimilar to my own)... Would we have believed he really ate pickled onions in the bath had he been clean-shaven? Of course not.’ After Paxman unveiled the facial fuzz last week, he accused BBC colleagues of pognophobia, an irrational fear of beards, after they questioned whether he should front the show unshaven. Paxman says becoming the poster-boy for beards has been a 'heavy burden'. The Newsnight presenter became the centre of a Twitterstorm last week but reactions to his facial hair were divided - with some viewers saying he looked like a 'rubbish Doctor Who'. The 63-year-old said he has been shocked by the reaction to his stubble. He said he was surprised about the widespread reporting about of his facial hair that he called 'a storm in a shaving mug.' Paxman said the reaction 'may explain why beardies seem to consider themselves an oppressed minority.' The presenter said men with beards have shouted words of encouragement in the street, asking him not to shave it off. He wrote: 'I had joined a section of society that I fully expect - indeed I demand - merits the sort of legal protection accorded to other minorities.' Paxman unveiled his new hairy face for the first time on Monday. Within minutes of his appearance, it became one of the most talked-about subjects on Twitter. Paxman’s colleague Emily Maitlis responded by joking: ‘Right that’s it. I’m working on a moustache for Thursday’s Newsnight.’ Last week, the presenter accused the BBC of pogonophobia - an irrational fear of beards - and said the only beards acceptable to the corporation are worn by Uncle Albert on Only Fools and Horses, Demis Roussos or Abu Hamza. Paxman said the more powerful men become, the more clean shaven they are likely to be. The presenter said he is tempted to shave his beard off because friends said it makes him look older .

Locked in an embrace for more than 165 million years, what's thought to be the oldest fossilised evidence of two insects having sex has been discovered in China. Researchers believe the pair were halfway through mating when they were killed by toxic gases released by a volcanic eruption. They were then blown by the wind into a lake where they were buried, and ultimately protected, for millions of years. The team from Capital Normal University in China uncovered the intact specimen in the region of Daohugou in Inner Mongolia. Researchers from China found the preserved specimen under sediment in the Daohugou region of Inner Mongolia. The bugs are still interlocked and both sets of genitals can be clearly seen. The face-to-face mating ritual of the fossilised insects is similar to that seen in modern-day froghopper insects. Modern-day . froghoppers traditionally mate belly-to-belly while holding onto a . twig. They also mate side-by-side if having sex on a leaf or tree trunk. The . stomach of the fossilised male is twisted to make inserting his sex . organ easier, and this is common in modern-day insect species, including the froghoppers. The insects discovered are members of the Anthoscytina perpetua species. They were found face-to-face and the male sex organ is seen inserted inside the female. The holotype male was found on the right, with the allotype female, on the left. Study co-author Chung Kun Shih said fossils of copulating insects are rare - only 40 have ever been found worldwide - yet this latest discovery predates the oldest known fossil by around 65 million years.

And it said they could provide the 'smoking gun for a number of crimes' - although exactly which crimes were not specified. Adding . insult to inury, the hackers said Stratfor, which charges up to 300,000 subscribers . for its reports and analysis, was 'clueless' when it came to database . security. Assange said: 'Here we have a private intelligence firm, relying on informants from the U.S. government, foreign intelligence agencies with questionable reputations and journalists.' Emails between George Friedman, the founder of Stratfor, and Karl Rover, a senior adviser to George Bush, are among those that are being released. At today's press conference, Mr Assange said he would not reveal where the emails had come from. 'We are a source protection organisation,' he said. 'As a source protection organisation and simply as a media organisation we don't discuss or speculate on sourcing.' The documents are believed to have come from loose-knit hacker group Anonymous, which claimed to have stolen information from the firm in December. Wikileaks said the emails show . Stratfor's 'web of informers, pay-off structure, payment-laundering . techniques and psychological methods'. It also said the material contains privileged information about the U.S. government's attacks against Julian Assange and WikiLeaks and Stratfor's own attempts to subvert WikiLeaks. The group said there are more than 4,000 emails mentioning WikiLeaks or Julian Assange. But . today Mr Assange said more information would emerge in the near future: . 'We have looked most closely at the actions against us, the bigger . story is likely to come out of this probably in three or four days' time.' Assange told how Stratfor 'fronts as an intelligence publisher', but provides confidential intelligence services to large corporations . Trademark mask: Hacking group Anonymous is believed to have obtained the Stratfor emails for WikiLeaks . He added: 'Today Wikileaks started releasing over five million emails from private intelligence firm Stratfor based in Texas. 'Together . with 25 other media partners from around the world we have been . investigating the activities of this company for some months. 'And what we have discovered is a company that is a private intelligence Enron. 'On the surface it presents as if it's a media organisation providing a private subscription intelligence newsletter. 'But . underneath it is running paid informants networks, laundering those . payments through the Bahamas, and through Switzerland, through private . credit cards. 'It is monitoring Bhopal activists for Dow Chemicals, Peta activities for Coca-Cola. 'It is engaged in a seedy business.' Julian Assange burst into the public consciousness in April 2010 when WikiLeaks released Collateral Murder - video footage of a U.S. air crew shooting Iraqi civilians in 2007. The whistleblower website, which claimed a database of 1.2 million documents within a year of its 2006 launch, regularly hit the headlines in 2010 with a series of leaks. The U.S. Embassy cables, Afghanistan war logs and Iraq war logs, which were drip-fed to the media in 2010, helped raise his profile. The Australian-born 40-year-old is currently under house arrest in Britain and fighting extradition to Sweden for questioning over alleged sex crimes. He is accused of sexual misconduct by two ex-WikiLeaks volunteers. Mr . Assange said Stratfor was using the secret intelligence it had paid for . to invest in a wide range of 'geopolitical financial instruments'. 'This makes News of the World look like kindergarten,' he added. Mr . Assange said the exposure of the emails was part of a long history . WikiLeaks has had in exposing the activities of secret organisations. He . said: 'The activities of intelligence organisations increasingly are . privatised and once privatised they are taken out of the realm of the . Freedom of Information Act, of U.S. military law and so they are often . used by governments who want to conceal particular activity. 'But Stratfor is simply out of control. 'Even . as a private intelligence organisation it is being completely hopeless . in protecting the identity of its informants, or even providing accurate . information. It is engaged in internal deals with a financial . investment firm that it is setting up. 'It really is some type of Enron where there is not even proper corporate control within the organisation.' WikiLeaks said it had worked with 25 media organisations to investigate and information would be released over the coming weeks. The . group said the emails expose a 'revolving door' in private intelligence . companies in the U.S., claiming government and diplomatic sources give . Stratfor advance knowledge of global politics and events in exchange for . money. 'The Global . Intelligence Files exposes how Stratfor has recruited a global network . of informants who are paid via Swiss banks accounts and pre-paid credit . cards,' the group said. 'Stratfor . has a mix of covert and overt informants, which includes government . employees, embassy staff and journalists around the world. HQ: Stratfor, based in Austin, Texas, said the release of its stolen emails was an attempt to silence and intimidate it - and vowed it would not be cowed . 'The . material shows how a private intelligence agency works, and how they . target individuals for their corporate and government clients.' WikiLeaks . accused Stratfor of 'routine use of secret cash bribes to get . information from insiders', and claims an email from chief executive . George Friedman in August 2011 suggested his concern over its legality. In it, he wrote: 'We are retaining a law firm to create a policy for Stratfor on the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. 'I don't plan to do the perp walk and I don't want anyone here doing it either.' The . group said: 'Like WikiLeaks' diplomatic cables, much of the . significance of the emails will be revealed over the coming weeks, as . our coalition and the public search through them and discover . connections.' It said Stratfor did secret deals with dozens of media organisations and journalists - from Reuters to the Kiev Post. 'While . it is acceptable for journalists to swap information or be paid by . other media organisations, because Stratfor is a private intelligence . organisation that services governments and private clients these . relationships are corrupt or corrupting.' The group said it has also obtained Stratfor's list of informants and, in many cases, records of its pay-offs.

With the summer wedding season in full swing, it seems it isn't just brides and grooms having to stump up hefty amounts of cash for the celebrations - guests are finding themselves footing increasingly chunky bills, too. The average British woman spends an average of £400 every time they attend a wedding as a guest, according to a study . Women tend to spend £210 on a wedding appropriate outfit - paying £100 for a dress and a further £50 on a pair of matching shoes. Vital accessories such as a clutch bag and jewellery cost an extra £60. The average British woman spends £400 each time they are a wedding guest, according to a new study . Many women even fork out £60 to get their hair and make-up done for the special event. Appearance aside, accommodation adds to the pricey bill, with hotels costing £80 for the night. And a wedding gift for the happy couple - be it gifts for the home, a donation or a set of vouchers - sets most people back £50. Being a close friend of the bride has obvious perks, but with that comes plenty of extra costs, . mainly down to the pre-wedding celebrations - in particular, the hen . party. With . hen parties becoming more like holidays than the traditional . 'party the night before the wedding', women are likely to spend £300 for a . short getaway with the girls.

Over two-thirds agreed that buying an outfit for the wedding worked out as the most expensive part. One respondent commented: 'I love weddings, but the amount of saving you have to do beforehand is ridiculous. I was invited to two of my best friends' weddings in the same year and ended up spending £1000 in total.

With all the travelling and the cost of finding somewhere to stay, it would have been £150 just to sort that out. All weddings seem to come at the same time as well.' A spokesperson for PromotionalCodes.org.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'Weddings are sun and fun and exciting time for everyone, but they are definitely a very expensive occasion, especially for women.

Thorbjorn Jagland said the rest of the continent looked to the UK to set an example on human rights ¿ calling it the 'best pupil in the class' - so it must let convicts have the vote . Britain is the ‘best pupil in class’ for obeying edicts from Strasbourg, a senior Eurocrat declared today. Thorbjorn Jagland, Secretary General of the Council of Europe, said the rest of the continent looked to the UK to set an example on human rights – so it must let convicts have the vote. His comments sparked fury among MPs who accused him of talking ‘patronising drivel’. They said that, given Britain had such a long track record of implementing judgments by the European Court of Human Rights, judges should realise they had made a major mistake by ruling it was unlawful to deny prisoners the vote. Britain is locked in a stand-off with Strasbourg over the ruling. At a Westminster hearing, Tory MP Nick Gibb asked Mr Jagland if it was the ‘judicial activism’ of Strasbourg that was the problem, rather than Britain ‘sliding into becoming an abuser of human rights’. Mr Jagland replied: ‘You [Britain] are the best pupil in the class.’ But he claimed that, if the UK did not obey the diktat on prisoner, votes, it would set a bad example to countries such as Russia. Mr Jagland said: ‘For millions of people out there in Europe this court is protecting their rights. This court is very popular’. He said it would be impossible for the UK to leave the convention on human rights and remain a member of the council. And he warned that Britain's international influence would be diminished if it decided to go for the 'nuclear possibility' of not complying with the ruling. Mr Jagland, whose council oversees the ECtHR, said: ‘The implications for the Council of Europe would be that other countries will start to do the same and it will be the beginning of the weakening of the whole convention system,' he said. Rebuttal: Conservative MP Dominic Raab called Mr Jagland's comments: 'Yet more patronising drivel from the Eurocrats' 'If one says that we can pick and choose the judgments that we want to execute, then others will say exactly the same and then this convention will be another convention, for instance like they have in the United Nations. ‘They are very weak. They are there but there is no enforcement of the standards. ‘If you start to pick and choose the judgments from the court of course the court will be weakened and in the end have no meaning.’ Mr Jagland added: 'The impact for Britain as I see it would be negative. It would harm UK reputation and influence in Europe and in the world. 'Can you imagine what would happen if the UK as the founding father of this institution is to leave it?’ - Home secretary Theresa May blamed the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg for the UK's inability to send the radical Islamist cleric Abu Qatada to Jordan for trial. Qatada's legal team used legislation guaranteeing the right to a fair trial. - Police have secretly removed dozens of convicted sex offenders, including paedophiles and rapists, from the Sex Offenders’ Register. Following a human rights ruling, the law was changed last year to allow sex attackers to claim they no longer posed a threat and apply to be taken off the register. Since then, 43 applications have been approved behind closed doors, at the rate of one every five days. - The use of Article Eight of the Human Rights Act, which enshrines the right to a family life, has prevented two foreign rioters jailed for their part in England's civil unrest two years ago from being deported. Government anger over the use of Article Eight prompted the home secretary to draft new laws to stop foreign criminals avoiding deportation. Ministers believe judges will be unable to ignore the new legislation, as they appear to have ignored rules introduced last July that they should only allow the use of Article Eight in 'exceptional circumstances'. Tory MP Dominic Raab hit back: ‘This is yet more patronising drivel from the Eurocrats. The idea we should sacrifice democracy at home to promote the European agenda abroad is a Faustian bargain Parliament should reject.' The eurocrat made his comments in evidence to a Parliamentary committee considering how to break the deadlock between the UK and Strasbourg. The committee has been asked to consider three options for a draft bill - giving the vote to convicted prisoners serving up to six months, giving it to those serving up to four years or keeping the existing blanket ban. Almost 2,300 prisoners have lodged compensation claims over the denial of their ‘human right’ to vote. Legal experts have estimated each inmate could receive as much as £5,000 depending on how many elections they missed while behind bars. That could leave ministers with a bill topping £11million if all the claims are upheld.","Euro official said Britain long history of obeying Court of Human Rights .

With summer just around the corner, many Brits are preparing to stock up on new bikinis and flipflops for their long awaited jaunt abroad. But it seems they are putting poolside fashion ahead of one vital summer essential on their shopping list. A new survey has shown that nearly three quarters of all UK holidaymakers are at risk of UV exposure because they use out of date sun cream. Past their sell-by date: Three quarters of British holidaymakers said they used lotions that were more than a year old, and in many cases considerably older . The survey found that 74 per cent of people taking a sunny beach holiday this year would take lotion that is over a year old. The vast majority of sun creams have an effective use by date of 12 months from date of purchase after which time the manufacturers will not vouch for the active UV blocking ability of their products. But the vast majority of holidaymakers said they used lotions that were more than a year old, and in many cases considerably older. A third of people (32 per cent) said they would take sun creams that were over two years old and another third admitted keeping sun tan lotion over three years, with 15 per cent of people keeping sun block for over four years in their cupboard at home. NHS advises the use of a minimum SPF factor of 15 to prevent skin damage . Two thirds (65 per cent) were unaware that most sun creams were out of date by twelve months. Escentual.com Beauty Editor Emma Leslie, who carried out the research, said: 'Sun creams lose their ability to block UV after a year, so it’s advisable to replace your products every summer. 'If you check the label on your sun cream most of them have a mark which says “12M”, which means the manufacturer recommends it’s used for only twelve months after purchase. 'The effectiveness will deteriorate considerably after that time and the active ingredients will lose their potency and you may be left with little or no protection against the harmful UV rays.' Exposure to UV rays is a key factor in developing skin cancer and in the past 30 years malignant melanoma has been the fastest growing form of cancer in the UK. More than 65 per cent of Brits are unaware that most sun creams are out of date after a year . Incidence rates are now seven times higher for men, and four times higher for women than in the 1970s, and in 2010 there were 12,818 new cases and 2,203 deaths from skin cancer. Emma Leslie added: 'It’s so important to protect your skin against UV rays and it’s not just about avoiding cancer. Sun damage will prematurely age your skin, causing deep lines and wrinkles. 'It’s much better to tan safely and protect your skin from the worst ravages of the sun’s rays. And there are several reasonably priced high SPF lotions on the market now, so it’s not the case that the more protection you get the more the product costs.' Most holidaymakers said they would use SPF 20-30 at the start of their holiday, but by the end of the trip many would drop the SPF down as they got a tan and one quarter said they would use less than factor 10 for the last few days on holiday. NHS advises the use of a minimum SPF factor of 15 to prevent skin damage.","Sun creams lose their ability to block ultra-violet rays after a year .

Codie Thacker had been training since June for the race but said seeing the bib with 'the mark of the beast' made her sick. Her Whitley County high school coach tried to get race organizers to issue her with a new number, but when they refused Codie put faith before her desire to win and pulled out of the race.

The ex-wife of a Russian billionaire is asking $30 million for a waterfront compound in the New York borough of Brooklyn. Galina Anissimova, former wife of oligarch Vasily Anisimov, is selling the property which has two limestone mansions, a pool and two docks that can home a large yacht on Jamaica Bay. The Mill Basin property has the most expensive price tag Brooklyn has ever seen, and is twice as much as anything else on the market at present. Exclusive: Brooklyn's most expensive property can be seen occupying the far right corner on the Jamaica Bay shoreline . For $30,000 the buyer will become the owner of a gated compound with a main house, guest house and outdoor pavilion with kitchen. The Noel Jeffrey-designed main house has features such as a Lalique fireplace, a circular 'meditation room' and water views from every room. The 10-bedroom, 15-bathroom property was built in 1989 by John Rosatti, a Brooklyn car dealer with rumored mob connections. According to Curbed, inspectors found he excavated tidal wetlands then filled them with landfill in order to extend the property.He sold the property to Anissimova in 1996 for $3.7 million before the resulting lawsuit settled and she set about renovating it. Looking more Miami than New York, the property is all white stone and sharp edges. According to the New York Daily News, Anissimova bought the neighboring property and tore it down, then built the Noel Jeffret-designed 8,200-square-foot guest house. Jeffrey also remodelled the main house. Galina Anissimova's broker James Cornell of The Corcoran Group said she has probably spent more than $30 million on renovations. Fortress: The compound sits behind electronic gates in the Mill Basin area of Brooklyn . 'It’s perfect,' Cornell told the New York Daily News. 'It’s the highest quality everything I’ve ever seen in 24 years in the business.' The hotel-like interior spaces are in shades of cream and beige, with marble floors and bright white shiny ceilings.Vasily Anisimov made his fortune in aluminum and iron ore then diversified into real estate development. According to the Wall Street Journal, Anissimova is selling the Brooklyn property in the largely Russian enclave of Mill Basin because she spends most of her time in Florida - a locale the compound would look right at home in - and plans to buy a smaller apartment in Manhattan. Galina Anissimova's daughter, Anna Anissimova, has been called 'the Russian Paris Hilton.' Last year, she listed an apartment in Manhattan for sale for $50 million but eventually took it off the market. She may be able to spare her mother a room in the meantime.","The most expensive Brooklyn property ever is up for sale .

Pop star Rita Ora posted a photo of herself last week having Vitamin B12 injected into her bottom. She is the latest in a line of stars following this crazy fad, apparently as an energy boost. Shooting up: Singer Rita Ora, in printed trousers, left, and friend Emily Rose receive B12 Vitamin injections . Even for celebrities, this seems radical. Is it really a good idea? B12 injections are important  for people with a deficiency and it is possible that Rita was prescribed this treatment. However, for those with normal B12 levels, there’s no evidence it will help – and no proof it will replenish energy levels. Unless you have problems with your bowel, there’s no reason not to take a normal oral supplement. Vitamin boost: Jabs are only needed by people who have a B12 deficiency . So why is Vitamin B12  so important? This vitamin is vital for a healthy nervous system and blood cells. It helps utilise energy from our food, which is possibly where the idea comes for fatigue-busting injections. Usual sources would be animal products including meat, eggs, cheese and milk, plus fish and fortified cereals, so most of us already get plenty from our diet. Why do some people have it injected? The most common cause  of B12 deficiency is a condition called pernicious anaemia. This is where your stomach lacks the right protein to absorb the vitamin from food. It leads to immense fatigue and breathlessness, and sometimes tinnitus. As the condition means no B12 can be taken in through the gut, injections are vital and initially they are given three times a week to build up stores. After that, a jab once every three months is usually enough to resolve symptoms. What about the trend  for IV vitamin drips? These intravenous drips are completely unnecessary  for otherwise healthy people.  A balanced diet is perfectly adequate for maintaining normal levels of vitamins, and if there is any dietary lack, a tablet is enough to rectify the problem.","New trend of Vitamin 12 injections growing among celebrities .

A wrongful death lawsuit seeking at least $1 million has been filed against a 75-year-old Detroit-area woman who was convicted of killing her 17-year-old grandson. The lawsuit was filed recently in Oakland County Circuit Court against Sandra Layne and her husband Fred Layne, 86, by a representative of Jonathan Hoffman's estate. Layne's attorney Jerome Sabbota told the Detroit Free Press and The Detroit News that he's not surprised by the lawsuit. Sabbota notes that Layne's husband wasn't charged in the killing. Jailed: Sandra Layne, 75, is seen being led out of court after being sentenced to at least 22 years in prison in April 2013 for killing her grandson . Tears: Sandra Layne sobbing heavily during proceedings, as she did during this court appearance on March 13 . Hoffman was shot six times, including twice in the back, in West Bloomfield Township in 2012. Layne . said she shot him out of fear during a physical altercation, but a jury . rejected her claim of self-defense and convicted her of second-degree . murder. Layne was sentenced to at least 22 years in prison in April of this year and is currently in prison. Sandra . Layne got a minimum sentence of 20 years for second-degree murder, . along with a mandatory two-year sentence for using a gun to kill . 17-year-old Jonathan Hoffman. Prosecutors said there were no signs of Layne being injured by Hoffman. A recording of a 911 call shows him being shot again while pleading for help - a critical piece of evidence that jurors played over and over during deliberations in April, 2013. Judge Denise Langford Morris zeroed in on it, too, wondering why Layne simply didn't call police if she felt helpless. Devastated: The husband of Sandra Layne, 87-year-old Fred Layne openly wept as the verdict was read in April - he was not charged . Grief: Jennifer Hoffman, right, mother of shooting victim Jonathan Hoffman, called her mother a 'monster' after she was convicted in March . 'Grandmothers are supposed to protect... Why did you keep shooting and how could you keep shooting?' Morris asked. 'You didn't have to keep shooting. Those were hollow-pointed bullets designed for a devastating impact.' Layne . sobbed heavily during a long, rambling address to the judge, her belly . chains and handcuffs sagging over orange jail clothes on her slight . frame. Tragic: Jonathan Hoffman, 17, was shot dead by his grandmother in the spring of 2012 . 'I'm sorry for what I did. I apologize . to everyone I've hurt, everyone... Sorry is too small a word,' she . said, pleading with Morris to not allow her to die in prison. Layne's daughter, Jennifer Hoffman, urged the judge to show no mercy. 'She showed no mercy when she planned, stalked and murdered my son in . his bedroom. Sandra Layne is pure evil and if given the opportunity . would surely kill again,' Jennifer Hoffman said. Hoffman's father did not attend the . hearing because he was in Arizona with his 16-year-old daughter, . Jessica, who was recovering from a tumor. Michael Hoffman said the girl . 'has a hole in her heart to match the hole in her head' since her . brother's death. In a letter read by the prosecutor, . the father said Layne 'put on her war paint and came in gunning for my . boy.' He accused Layne of killing his son because he was ready to move . on after high school and she would no longer be able to control him. Hoffman was living with his grandmother during his last year of high school while his parents lived in Arizona where a daughter was being treated for a brain tumor. He had a history of drug use and had tested positive for synthetic marijuana on the day of the shooting. Layne claimed he feared flunking probation and demanded money and a car to leave the area. Sandra Layne looks back to family members after being sentenced to second-degree murder . Prosecutors, however, said Hoffman . was wearing just shorts and socks when he was killed and had made plans . to see a friend that night, not flee. Prosecutor . Paul Walton, noting the minutes that went by before Layne shot the boy . again, said he had never handled a homicide 'this cold, this long and . this calculating.' Layne . blamed the parents for not taking Jonathan back to Arizona and said her . grandson's drug use made him unmanageable for an elderly woman. She . accused Michael Hoffman of giving up on the boy and said she pleaded . with the pair to return to Michigan when drugs landed him in the . hospital. 'If I could go . back, I never would have bought that gun,' Layne told the judge. 'I . would have said to his parents it's their responsibility, help him, take . him.' Following the verdict, Ms Hoffman told the Detroit Free Press that she was happy that her mother had been found guilty. She added: 'I know my son is in heaven and that is a place she’ll never see.' Hoffman had been living with his grandparents since 2011 when his parents divorced and moved to Arizona. The elderly woman's husband Fred Layne wept in court as his wife was shackled and taken away by officers.","Sandra Layne was convicted of second-degree murder for killing her 17-year-old grandson Jonathan Hoffman in May 2012 .

It may look identical to the spirograph patterns created by children - but in fact this incredible image shows the path of a space telescope. It shows NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope, which orbits our planet every 95 minutes, building up increasingly deeper views of the universe with every circuit. Its wide-eyed Large Area Telescope (LAT) sweeps across the entire sky every three hours, capturing the highest-energy form of light -- gamma rays -- from sources across the universe. Scroll down for video . This spirograph-like pattern shows the path of an orbiting telescope's field of view over the period of 51 months it spent in low Earth orbit observice a pulsar . Pulsars are neutron stars, the crushed cores of massive suns that . destroyed themselves when they ran out of fuel, collapsed and exploded. The blast simultaneously shattered the star and compressed its core into . a body as small as a city yet more massive than the sun. The result is . an object of incredible density, where a spoonful of matter weighs as . much as a mountain on Earth. Equally incredible is a pulsar's rapid . spin, with typical rotation periods ranging from once every few seconds . up to hundreds of times a second. The amazing images were captured over the 51 months the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi gamma ray observatory was observing the Vela pulsar. 'The pattern reflects numerous motions of the spacecraft, including its . orbit around Earth, the precession of its orbital plane, the manner in . which the LAT nods north and south on alternate orbits, and more,' said Nasa. Eric Charles, a physicist at the Kavli Institute for . Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology and the SLAC National Accelerator . Laboratory at Stanford University in California, has transformed data of a famous pulsar into a mesmerizing movie that visually encapsulates the spacecraft's complex motion. The movie renders Vela's position in a fisheye perspective, where the . middle of the pattern corresponds to the central and most sensitive . portion of the LAT's field of view. 'The pattern created in the Vela movie reflects numerous motions of the . spacecraft,' says Nasa. 'The first is Fermi's 95-minute orbit around Earth, but . there's another, subtler motion related to it. 'The orbit itself also . rotates, a phenomenon called precession. 'Similar to the wobble of an . unsteady top, Fermi's orbital plane makes a slow circuit around Earth . every 54 days.' The amazing images were captured over the 51 months the Large Area Telescope (LAT) on the Fermi gamma ray observatory was observing the Vela pulsar . The movement creates beautiful patterns over time as engineers tweak to position of the spacecraft . In order to capture the entire sky every two orbits, scientists . deliberately nod the LAT in a repeating pattern from one orbit to the . next. It first looks north on one orbit, south on the next, and then . north again. An original spirograph set . Spirograph was a hugely popular children's toy in the 1970s and 70s. It was developed by British engineer Denys Fisher and first sold in 1965. The geometric drawing toy produces mathematical roulette curves of the variety technically known as hypotrochoids and epitrochoids. It was able to create a huge range of different patterns when the 'wheels' used were changed, allowing an almost limitless number of variations. A Spirograph consists of a set of plastic gears and other shapes such as rings, triangles, or straight bars. There are several sizes of gears and shapes, and all edges have teeth to engage any other piece. For instance, smaller gears fit inside the larger rings, but also can engage the outside of the rings so they rotate around the inside or along the outside edge of the rings. Patterns created using the Spirograph . Every few weeks, the LAT deviates from this pattern to . concentrate on particularly interesting targets, such as eruptions on . the sun, brief but brilliant gamma-ray bursts associated with the birth . of stellar-mass black holes, and outbursts from supermassive black holes . in distant galaxies. The Vela movie captures one other Fermi . motion. The spacecraft rolls to keep the sun from shining on and warming . up the LAT's radiators, which regulate its temperature by bleeding . excess heat into space. The LAT's sensitivity to gamma rays is greatest in the center of its wide field of view and decreases toward the edge. LAT scientists regard the effective limit of the instrument's field of view to be 78.5 degrees (red circle) from its center .","Image shows the path of NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope .

Strong criticism: Lord Oakeshott slammed the 'culture of collusion' between large companies and HMRC . The full extent of tax avoidance by big business was laid bare yesterday on a ‘black day’ for taxpayers. Despite soaring profits, corporation tax payments by the UK’s largest firms have fallen by more than a fifth since 2000. In the same period, the amount contributed by small businesses has almost trebled. And a report on illegal tax evasion warned cash payments hidden from the taxman could cost families more than £200 each a year. Critics last night slammed the ‘culture of collusion’ between large companies and Her Majesty’s Revenue and Customs. ‘It’s a black day for hard-pressed families and small businessmen who can’t afford millionaire lawyers and accountants to bamboozle the taxman,’ said former LibDem treasury spokesman Lord Oakeshott. ‘HMRC cosied up to the big tax dodgers under Labour and the coalition Government must stamp out this culture of collusion.’ In 1999 then-chancellor Gordon Brown abandoned plans for a crackdown on tax avoidance. Two years later he began telling tax officials to work on the basis of ‘mutual trust’ with large firms. But an investigation by financial news service Reuters discovered that, since 2000, the profits of big businesses have risen by 65 per cent to £329billion last year. In the same period the amount of corporation tax paid to the Exchequer has slumped by £5billion, falling 21 per cent from £26billion to less than £21billion in 2012. Tax experts decried the figures as  ‘paradoxical’. ‘How are they managing to reconcile higher profits with lower taxes?’ said Prem  Sikka, professor of accounting at Essex University. ‘It can’t be done, unless they are booking these profits somewhere else. Corporate profits have risen, so you would have expected corporation tax payments to rise.’ Lord Oakeshott added that HMRC (headquarters pictured) cosied up to the big tax dodgers under Labour. An investigation discovered that, since 2000, the profits of big businesses have risen by 65 per cent . Any company making £1.5million or more in profits is counted as ‘big’ by HMRC, because they qualify for the full rate of corporation tax. In 2000 there were 38,000 such firms, rising to almost 40,000 last year. In the same period, HMRC figures show the amount of corporation tax paid by small companies rose from £4.4billion to £12.1billion. Tax accountant Richard Murphy said: ‘This is a game of two completely different halves. Large companies have had a great time, making more profit and yet seeing their taxes fall. ‘Small companies have had a much harder time, growing by number but with the tax system not doing them any favours.’ Multinationals such as Google, Starbucks, Amazon and Facebook have been lambasted for their ‘immoral’ tax avoidance policies. Multinationals such as Starbucks have been lambasted for their 'immoral' policies . On sales of £2.6billion last year in the UK, Google paid just £6million in corporation tax. HMRC said the fall in big business payments was due to lower corporation tax rates. A spokesman said: ‘HMRC ensures multinationals pay the tax due in accordance with UK tax law. We have been very successful in reducing tax avoidance by large businesses in recent years.’ From 2000 to 2007, the rate of corporation tax was 30 per cent. It was reduced to 26 per cent last year. But Reuters said this only amounts to half the difference – leaving £2.6billion unaccounted for. Another factor was overseas takeovers of firms, such as Cadburys and Boots, where the tax base is moved to more lenient regimes. Meanwhile, a study by the TaxPayers’ Alliance showed illegal tax evasion could cost the UK more than £6billion a year, the equivalent of £219 for every household. The report found the level of ‘direct tax’, such as income tax and capital gains tax, led to the loss of £3.6billion in 2010 as it was so high that people chose to risk not  paying it.","Corporation tax payments by UK's largest firms have fallen by more than a fifth since 2000 .

An outraged father is suing a child psychologist after she dubbed him an unfit parent because he refused to take his five-year-old son to McDonald's. David Evan Schorr, 43, an attorney from the Upper East Side, says in a civil lawsuit that he planned to take his son Max to their 'usual restaurant' on a recent custody visit but the child demanded to go to McDonald's and 'threw a tantrum' when he said no. The father drew the line at the unhealthy burger joint because he felt Max had been eating 'too much junk food,' the court papers state, so Schorr gave the boy an ultimatum: dinner at any other restaurant, or no dinner at all. McDonald's: Schorr drew the line at McDonald's, pictured, because he felt his son had been eating 'too much junk food,' the court papers state . 'The child, stubborn as a mule, chose the ""no dinner"" option,' the suit states. Not wanting to reward his bad behavior, Schorr stood his ground but when he dropped the hungry boy home later that night, he apparently tattled. The child's mother, Bari Yunis Schorr, with whom Schorr is in the midst of a bitter custody battle, immediately called their court-appointed psychologist Marilyn Schiller and reported the incident, according to the suit. The Schorrs married in a lavish ceremony at the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan but just four years later, in 2011, Mrs Schorr sued her husband for a divorce. Lawsuit: Child psychologist Marilyn Schiller, pictured, is being sued after she allegedly dubbed New York father David Schorr an unfit parent because he refused to take his five-year-old son to McDonald's . She recently filed motions asking the judge to punish her ex for flouting court orders and for a judgment on nonpayment of child support, according to The New York Post. After Dr Schiller heard about the McDonald's incident, she demanded Schorr submit to a forensic examination before a custody trial with his estranged wife, the suit states. Dr Schiller allegedly only interviewed the child and his mother then told the court the father was 'wholly incapable of taking care of his son' and should be denied his weekend visitation. The furious father says he's had partial custody of his son for two and a half years and it's always 'run smoothly without incident.' Custody battle: After dropping his son home hungry, Schorr's ex-wife, Bari Yunis Schorr, pictured, reported the incident to the court-appointed shrink, the papers state . He says in the suit that he wished 'mightily that he had agreed to McDonald’s in the first place' but believes he needed to set an example. Schorr is now demanding the shrink return the $2,750 he paid for the evaluation he claims was a sham and based entirely on the McDonald's incident. Dr Schiller told the New York Post she could not comment on the details of the incident, saying only: 'I am conducting a forensic evaluation on this matter. I will be issuing a confidential report to the court and the matter will be tried by the court.' Bari Schorr's attorney, Louis I. Newman, said the litigation did not involve his client and refused to comment.

Speaking Monday via satellite to climate experts gathered for this week’s Pacific Islands Forum (PIF) in the Marshall Islands, US Secretary of State John Kerry asserted that climate change needs to be taken more seriously and that action can be taken to stem the tide of consequence. The Marshall Islands, at no more than three feet above sea level, are especially at risk of rising seas, one of the many effects of global warming. Concerned: US Secretary of State John Kerry is concerned nations aren't taking the threat of global warming seriously . ‘The science is clear. It is irrefutable and it is alarming,’ Mr Kerry said via satellite from Washington, DC. ‘If we continue down our current path, the impacts of climate change will only get worse.’ Saying ‘I stand with you in the fight against climate change,’ Mr Kerry advocated strong, immediate action to limit the threats posed to infrastructure, health, the world economy and even the viability of island nations. Mr Kerry also said it will take more than one nation to make a difference. ‘If we act together, there is still time to prevent some of the worst impacts of climate change,’ said Mr Kerry, adding that ‘the people of the Pacific Islands know as well as anyone that we also need to prepare communities for the impacts that are already being felt.’ Melting: The Sheldon Glacier near Rothera Research Station, Adelaide Island, Antarctica is melting as a result of global warming . Irrefutable: Warmer temperatures are leading to more severe weather . The former US Senator was not the only one to express worry over the future of Pacific island nations. Speaking before Mr Kerry, European Union Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said inaction will only further endanger the many low-lying nations in the Pacific. Ms Hedegaard also lamented that some countries might not honor the 2015 emissions reduction and alternative energy use deadline previously agreed to by most nations. ‘We have to make a joint pressure to say the world is already more than late,’ said Hedegard, adding that ‘2015 must be taken seriously.’ With Pacific islands not responsible for climate change planning to be in compliance with the new emissions rules, it’s difficult for other nations to justify not complying, Hedegard noted. A dangerous tide: Rising sea levels and warmer temperatures are creating stronger storms, leaving coastal regions at higher risk . More commonplace: Flooding caused by stronger storms, such as Tropical Storm Kong-Rey, which recently flooded parts of Taiwan, will be more common in the future . A ‘Majuro Declaration,’ geared towards bringing further attention to climate change and efforts to limit its impact, is set to be finalized by PIF this week. Tuvalu Prime Minister Enele Sopoaga argued that the situation faced by Pacific is ‘dire,’ and requires immediate action, rather than pledges that might be rolled back in the future. 'We need concrete action on the ground to save Tuvalu, Marshall Islands and Kiribati,' said the worried Mr Sopoaga, adding that ‘we have to send a very strong signal out of this panel and forum that we need a legally binding agreement [on emissions]. As tropical storms become more severe and sea levels continue to rise, it is only a matter of time before many of the smaller island nations that dot the Pacific wiped from existence. Many of them sit barely above sea level, and already have residents voluntarily uprooting to safer areas. The PIF nations will present the Majuro declaration to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon at the General Assembly meeting in New York one month from now.","US Secretary of State John Kerry made the remarks Monday during an address to the Pacific Islands Forum .

Coca-Cola and Pepsi have been forced to change their recipes in America to avoid having to put cancer-warning labels on their cans - while the drinks in Britain stay the same. There were concerns that one of the food-colouring ingredients may cause tumours in mice - although there was no evidence of a similar risk for humans. Nonetheless both manufacturers have altered their recipes for drinks sold in America and they now contain far less of the offending chemical. Always coca-cola: The company are adjusting their colouring formula to dodge having a cancer label on the product . But products sold in the UK will still . be made to the same old recipe as European regulators do not believe . they pose any health risks. Officials point out that one would . need to drink 1,000 cans of Coke a day to get the same dose of the . chemical that was linked to tumours in mice. Studies in the lab had found that the . ingredient '4-methylimidazole' - which gives the drink its caramel brown . colour - caused cancer in mice and rats. This led to the state of California . adding the chemical to its official list of ingredients that may cause . cancer - or 'carcinogens' - earlier this year. Chemical: 4-MI, used in Coke's colouring, causes cancer in rodents . Under the state's law, Coca-Cola and . Pepsi would have had to put cancer warning labels on bottles and cans . alerting the public to the possible risk. This may well have put many customers . off from buying the drinks so the manufacturers instead decided to . change the recipes for products sold in California. Over the next few weeks they will roll out the new versions across the rest of America. But the European Food Safety . Authority, which assesses the risk of food and drink across the EU, does . not believe the ingredient poses any danger. A spokesman for the Food Standards Agency said for this reason the drinks sold in Britain will remain exactly the same. They said: 'The European Food Safety . Authority recently looked at 4-methylimidazole and concluded it does not . pose a health risk to humans. Based on available evidence, the presence . of 4-methylimidazole in colouring agents is not a food safety concern.' It is very rare for Coca-Cola and Pepsi to change their recipes however. In fact when Coca-Cola tried to make . the drink slightly sweeter in 1985 and relaunched it as 'New Coke' in . the US there was a public outcry. Less than three months later the company announced it was reverting back to the original recipe. A Coca-Cola spokesman told MailOnline that rather than 'changing its recipe' it was simply changing the production process of one of its ingredients. 'The caramel colour in all of our products has been, is and always will be safe, and The Coca-Cola Company is not changing the world-famous formula for our Coca-Cola beverages,' she said. 'Over the years, we have updated our manufacturing processes from time to time, but never altered our Secret Formula. 'We have asked our caramel manufacturers to modify their production process to reduce the amount of 4-MEI in the caramel. 'But that will have no effect on the formula or on the great-tasting, high-quality products that consumers expect from us. 'These modifications will not affect the colour or taste of Coca-Cola. Our commitment to the highest quality and safety of our great brands remains our top priority. 'And we will continue to rely on sound, evidence-based science to ensure that our products are safe.' The exact recipe of the fizzy drink have always been a mystery. Today's official recipe is rumoured to be guarded 24-hours a day in a vault in Atlanta. The list of ingredients below are meant to be those used by pharmacist John Pemberton, who created the drink in 1886.","Both firms to alter the way caramel colour is produced .

In one scene she is stretched out on a recliner, wearing nothing but paint, as Future, dressed all in black, looks on. Sexy alien: Miley Cyrus is naked apart from metallic body paint in the new video for Future's Real & True . In another scene, the duo get up close and personal and look as if they are about to kiss. Meanwhile a behind the scenes picture shows both Future, whose nickname is Astronaut Kid, and Mr. Hudson, who also features on the track, dressed as astronauts. Blonde Miley is covered up in a green boiler suit as they stare at a monitor. Future posted a picture to Instagram from the shoot, featuring him blowing smoke out of his mouth. The rapper also features on Miley’s new album Bangerz - which beat off competition from Panic! at the Disco and Drake to take the Billboard top spot - on the track My Darlin’ and he revealed her personal woes helped to make the record even better. Up close and personal: Future and Miley look as if they are about to kiss in the video for their collaboration . Miley has had a tough time in the past few months, topped off by a split from her fiancé Liam Hemsworth after which he was spotted kissing Mexican actress Eiza Gonzalez. Future told MTV@ ‘We got a lot of great records, and it all came from conversation and having a nice vibe. Whenever she allowed me in her personal life through conversation, I tried to take that vibe and go to the booth. I told her, 'You've gotta embrace your fears. 'If something's bothering you, you've gotta run toward it. If you're crying about it, you need to cry till you can't cry anymore. If you try to hold it back, then it's gonna eat you up. But if you embrace [it], the music moves. ‘The songs I did with her [are] very touching. Certain days it's about money, partying and vibing and some days [it's about needing] somebody to stand by you and hold you down. Astronaut Kid: Future, whose nickname is Astronaut Kid, rather aptly plays an astronaut in the music video alongside Mr Hudson . 'Certain days you wanna know if the love that you're with is really true, and one song we got is basically around all those subject matters.’ However, things are looking up for Miley who appears to be moving on following her split from Liam, which the pair confirmed last month. The star is said to be dating Rolling Stone magazine heir Theo Wenner, 26, who is no stranger to dating celebrities as he dated Liv Tyler, 36, in 2011. According to Radar Miley 'communicates with Wenner several times a day and says the pair are dating, albeit casually’. 'She’s definitely dating him,' a source told the celebrity website.

It follows concern that there are too few staff to cope with the soaring numbers turning up in A&E. But the demand drew an angry response from patients’ groups, one of which said: ‘It’s not a part-time business they’re working in, it’s a full-time job.’ Tough job: Casualty doctors say they must be paid double to work evenings and weekends, following concern that there are too few staff to cope with the soaring numbers turning up in A&E. (Stock picture) Yesterday a report by the Health Select Committee warned that 80 per cent of emergency departments did not always have a consultant working during the 16 busiest hours of the day. And the College of Emergency Medicine said there is a ‘recruitment crisis’, with too few junior doctors wanting to pursue a career in A&E because it is so demanding. Its president Dr Clifford Mann, an A&E consultant, said the NHS needed an extra 300 doctors in casualty to ensure patients were properly cared for round the clock. He said their terms and conditions should be ‘amended’ – with higher pay for out-of-hours work – to make the profession more attractive. At present, A&E doctors’ hourly pay is about 25 per cent more for overnight and weekend shifts. But Dr Mann said the salary calculations should be changed so doctors working shifts after midnight would receive twice the hourly rate, allowing them to take more time off while earning a similar salary. But well remunerated: Dr Clifford Mann said salary calculations should be changed so doctors working after midnight receive twice the hourly rate, allowing them to take more time off while earning a similar salary . ‘It’s not because we want people to . earn more money, it’s because they need more time back,’ added Dr Mann, a . consultant at the Taunton and Somerset hospitals trust. ‘A doctor would work two nights a week, and then one weekend in three but then he would actually get nine days off. 'It . would mean, yes, you work these antisocial hours, but you would get . quite a bit of time off, usually in blocks, which means you could do . something else with your life.’ Recruitment crisis: Too few junior doctors want to pursue a career in A&E because it is so demanding, said the College of Emergency Medicine . He said the NHS has failed to recruit 100 junior doctors into senior posts in A&E for the last three years running. Consultants earn an average of £108,000 a year while middle-grade doctors are on salaries of between £60,000 and £80,000. If their pay were to be increased, the impact on their salaries would depend on how many out-of-hours shifts they did in A&E. Joyce Robins, of Patient Concern, said: ‘It’s absolutely ridiculous to demand doctors be paid more. It’s not a part-time business they’re working in, it’s a full-time job. 'If you work in A&E that’s your job to work unsociable hours – that’s what patients expect and what patients need. You shouldn’t go into it if you want short hours – it isn’t that sort of job. 'Doctors in A&E departments aren’t the only people who have to work nights and weekends, so why should they earn more?’ Conservative Andrew Percy, who serves on the Health Committee, said: ‘I’d like to think that the vast majority of people who go into medicine do it because they want to give back to the community and that means working unsociable hours. ‘I’m on a good wage and I volunteer with the ambulance service to help others. Doctors are on an even better wage. ‘To suggest they should get paid more is effectively to say that more of the NHS budget should be spent on their salaries and that less should be spent on patient care, which is unacceptable.’ He added: ‘Doctors do work very hard, and are very dedicated to their training but to say they should be paid more is a bit cheeky. ‘What should drive you is the want to give back to the community. Public service is a privilege and those who work in the public sector are rewarded handsomely in their pay and pension schemes as it is. ‘Now is not the time to argue more should be spent on salaries.’ Yesterday a report by MPs on the Health . Select Committee warned that A&E units would be unable to cope with . the surge in sick patients this winter. Last year more than a quarter of a million extra patients turned up in casualty compared with the previous 12 months and the numbers are expected to rise further. This increase has been blamed on a failure of GP out-of-hours services – which leaves patients with nowhere else to go – on top of the ageing population with higher numbers of the elderly becoming ill. The problems have been worsened by the NHS 111 helpline with patients being sent down to A&E unnecessarily by unqualified call centre handlers. Dame Barbara Hakin, chief operating officer of NHS England, the body that runs the Health Service, said: ‘It’s very disappointing that accident and emergency departments don’t have as much consultant cover as we would all wish them to have. ‘We need to work much harder at making this an attractive profession for young doctors. If you don’t have the best possible resource, that can compromise the best treatment.’","Doctors’ hourly pay is now 25 per cent more for night and weekend shifts .

Tragedy: Six-year-old Jack Adcock died from pneumonia after a doctor mistook him for another child with a 'do not resuscitate order' A boy of six died after a hospital doctor mixed him up with another child who was subject to a ‘do not resuscitate’ order, an inquest heard. Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba admitted she stopped staff who were trying to save Jack Adcock’s life and said she had not bothered to check his identity. The paediatric registrar said: ‘I should have checked the face before stopping. ‘But I had been working for 12 hours with no break.’ Jack, who had Down’s syndrome, was admitted to the Leicester Royal Infirmary with breathing difficulties, a raised temperature and high heart rate. His condition deteriorated and he suffered a cardiac arrest. Dr Bawa-Garba, 36, admitted she was ‘not on top of things’ having recently returned from 13 months of maternity leave. She said that during her time off work, she had become ‘deskilled in the management and treatment of shock’, failed to recognise Jack was in shock and failed to recognise his ‘grossly abnormal’ blood results. A ‘do not resuscitate’ order on a patient’s file means that a doctor is not required to revive a patient if their heart stops. They are issued after discussions with parents or their family. They are designed to prevent unnecessary suffering, for example if a patient’s condition is such that resuscitation is unlikely to succeed or if successful resuscitation would lead to a poor quality of life. But Jack’s mother Nicola Adcock, 39, described him as a ‘tough little cookie’ and confirmed a ‘do not resuscitate’ order had never been placed on him. Heartbroken: Jack's parents Nicky and Victor Adcock both attended the inquest into their son's death yesterday . Dr Bawa-Garba confused  Jack with . another youngster  on the same ward who was subject to a ‘do not . resuscitate’ order,  the inquest at Leicester Town Hall heard. Jack died of pneumonia in the hospital . on February 18, 2011, the same day he was admitted, after Dr Bawa-Garba . interrupted attempts to resuscitate him. Asked by Leicester Coroner . Catherine Mason whether she actually saw Jack’s face before telling . staff to stop, Dr Bawa-Garba said: ‘There were a lot of people in the . room and I can’t remember if I saw a face or not. ‘But what was important to me was not to resuscitate a child that was not to be resuscitated.’ She realised her mistake only when . another doctor asked her: ‘Why is Jack not for resuscitation?’ Dr . Bawa-Garba then shouted: ‘He is for resus – it’s the wrong patient,’ the . inquest heard. As soon as she realised her mistake, . she returned to Jack and tried to treat him as part of a team of medics . who battled for nearly an hour to resuscitate him, but were . unsuccessful. Paediatric registrar Dr Hadiza Bawa-Garba said she was 'not on top of things' after working a 12 hour shift without a break at Leicester Royal Infirmary, pictured . She was also questioned about why she had telephoned Jack’s mother two days after his death. Dr Bawa-Garba told the inquest it was . ‘just out of courtesy’ and claimed she only later found out from the . hospital trust that she was not meant to. Yesterday Mrs Adcock and her husband . Victor Adcock, 47, of  Glen Parva, Leicester, who also have a younger . daughter, listened as the inquest was told how the ‘crash team’ was . called when Jack went into cardiac arrest at about 7.45pm. His mother . had been at his bedside and it was she who first asked for help. Staff nurse Katherine Ramsden wept as . she told how doctors ‘came running’ and began trying to resuscitate . Jack, but then Dr Bawa-Garba told them to stop. She said: ‘It was very . overwhelming. I tried to save him and I couldn’t.’ The inquest, expected to last another four days, continues. Do Not Resuscitate orders would . normally be issued when resuscitation will not restart the heart or . breathing, will be of no benefit to the patient, or when the burdens are . outweighed by the benefits. Guidelines issued by the British Medical . Association and the Royal College of Nursing require discussion with . patients or their  family before the orders can be made. They can be made if resuscitation is . unlikely to succeed; if a mentally competent patient has consistently . asked not to be resuscitated, or has said so in their will; or if . resuscitation would lead to poor quality of life. The process of keeping patients . breathing can be violent and cause trauma to patients, such as broken . ribs, other fractures, a ruptured spleen or brain damage.","Jack Adcock died of pneumonia at Leicester Royal Infirmary .

Zoos around the U.S.will soon find out whether a beagle named Elvis can let them know when their polar bears are pregnant. The two-year-old dog has been specially trained for a year by a Kansas handler who has taught canines to sniff out everything from explosives to bed bugs. A Cincinnati Zoo animal conservation scientist had the idea after reading about studies on using dogs to detect cancer. Scroll down for video . Elvis, a two-year-old beagle, sniffs polar bear protein samples at Iron Heart Performance Dog Center in Shawnee, Kansas . Elvis is demonstrating 97 per cent accuracy in positive identification of samples from pregnant females . Confirming pregnancies of the massive bears, a threatened species, has been difficult, and zoo officials say knowing can help make sure they and the mama bears are ready for birthing and raising cubs. They separate them from males, get them into dens with extra bedding, step up video-camera monitoring, and line up staff and volunteers for 24-hour 'cub watches' later. 'It's always nice to know in advance,' said Randi Meyerson of the Toledo Zoo, who coordinates polar bear species survival planning for the Association of Zoos and Aquariums. She praised the beagle project as 'thinking outside the box' to provide a potentially important new tool. Diagram showing how the process was discovered and how Elvis was trained in the job . It's non-invasive and simple for zookeepers, who pick up fecal samples for Elvis to check out. 'We didn't even know if this was possible,' said Matt Skogen, a former police officer who runs Ironheart High Performance Working Dogs in Shawnee, Kan. He was intrigued when Erin Curry, a post-doctoral fellow at the Cincinnati Zoo's Center for Conservation & Research of Endangered Wildlife, reached out for someone willing to test the idea after the center identified proteins present only in pregnant bears' samples. Skogen started with samples of bears that had already delivered babies, and from some known not to be pregnant because they hadn't mated. He also tried training a border collie for the bear pregnancy test but soon determined that Elvis, a former Ozarks rabbit hunter, was more adept. Polar bear protein samples await testing by Elvis, a beagle at Iron Heart Performance Dog Center in Shawnee, Kansas . 'He was very methodical,' Skogen said. 'You could tell he was really running it through the think tank.' Rewarded with food and getting to play with his favorite squeaky duck toy, Elvis trained for months and was alerting to samples of previously pregnant bears with near-perfect accuracy before Curry drove out a cooler full of current samples last week. She watched as Elvis reacted to a control sample of a bear that had already delivered. 'He sat right down. I thought, 'Whew, this works!'' Curry said. Elvis has been checking out samples of 22 female bears from 14 zoos, while Skogen logs his reactions. When Elvis is done, which could be in a matter of days, Curry will inform the other zoos whether Elvis predicts they'll be hearing the pitter-patter of little paws later this year. Elvis enjoys a moment with Erin Curry at Iron Heart Performance Dog Center in Shawnee, Kansas - Erin reached out for someone willing to test the idea of dogs sniffing out the pregnant bear samples . Meyerson, whose Toledo Zoo produced two of the only three cubs that were born in U.S. zoos last year, recommends that zoos continue monitoring and have female bears go into dens if they have mated, even if Elvis' new sniff test indicates they aren't pregnant. Polar bears have complicated reproductive cycles, and zoos have found that false pregnancies are common. Better results from captive breeding of polar bears can help zoo scientists learn more about their reproduction and also help public awareness. With the long-term survival of polar bears believed to be under threat by climate change impacts on icy habitats, species advocates such as Polar Bears International say zoo bears can play important roles. 'They serve as ambassadors for their species, and there are studies that can be done in zoos that would be impossible in the wild,' spokeswoman Barbara Nielsen said. Baby polar bear cubs Suka and Sakari, born in November, 2012, are seen at the zoo in Toledo, Ohio .","Beagle named Elvis will soon visit zoos around the U.S. to test their polar bears .

Mario Balotelli’s former girlfriend and the mother of his baby girl, is suing the footballer’s parents after they wrote an open letter accusing her of 'cashing in and exploiting' their son. Showgirl Raffaella Fico, 25, and Balotelli, 22, had a stormy relationship which ended last summer, just before she revealed she was pregnant with his child Pia, who was born in December, but who he refuses to officially acknowledge - demanding a DNA test to prove he is the father. The couple have since carried out a bitter war of words in various magazine articles with Raffaella accusing him of being 'uninterested in his child and her' and which resulted in his adoptive parents Franco and Silvia Balotelli hitting back saying that 'love was worth more than money and fame.' Story: Showgirl Raffaella Fico, 25, and Balotelli, 22, had a stormy relationship which ended last summer, just before she revealed she was pregnant with his child Pia, who was born in December, but who he refuses to officially acknowledge - demanding a DNA test to prove he is the father . They had added: 'Our son is not the irresponsible and undignified person that you (Raffaella) have described. For some time .now you have been speaking to the public, to journalists and photographers. 'Obviously you have your reasons for making your life a media event, allowing TV cameras and reporters to follow you everywhere.'

Euros but no date for the hearing has yet been set and neither they nor . Balotelli have commented on the legal action.

An Italian man has created a fantastical fairground in the woods by his restaurant - entirely in his spare time. Bruno, the owner of Ai Poppi in Montello, northern Italy, has hand-built swings, slides, seesaws, gyroscopes, a ferris wheel and even a roller-coaster over the past 40 years. Remarkably, all of the rides are hand-operated. A new documentary called Ai Pioppi documents his inspiring story, which began in June 1969 when Bruno brought a a jug of white wine and a jug of red wine and five or six kilos of sausages to the forest. Scroll down for video . Passion: The forest around an Italian restaurant is packed with swings, slides, seesaws, tilt-a-whirls and a kinetic roller-coasters - all built by hand by the owner . Dedicated: Bruno in his workshop. Over the past forty years he has built an amusement park by hand and in his own time . He said: 'I hung all the food on a tree and set the grill under it. I also bought some soppressa, a type of salami from Veneto, the big kind. I wanted to see if we would sell something or if people would come, because we didn't even have a sign in front of the place. 'And then two guys came. They stopped by and asked, ""what is this?"". 'It's a restaurant.' 'How is that possible? We passed by yesterday and there was nothing' one of the men asked. He replied: ' I told them ""you are our first customers. Think about that"".' 'And then one, four, ten, twenty people came to the restaurant and in two or three hours the food was finished. So exciting!' Astonishingly, this rollercoaster was built by one man in his workshop in his spare time . Bruno decided he would learn to weld and enjoyed it so much he began to dream up small rides he could build to entice new customers to Ai Pioppi . Ai Poppi now seats 500 people. His passion for amusement park rides began almost as an accident. Bruno needed four hooks hooks to join some chairs and went to a blacksmith in town, an old man. He said: 'I'll always remember him, I'd like to make a monument to him. I went to the shop and asked if he could make four hooks. Do you know what he said? '""I don't have time for these kind of things. If you know how to weld, the machine is over there. Do it yourself"".' 'I wish he never said that. Because then I started. I went to a workshop to learn how to weld. I aksed them to teach me and I started to learn. 'Besides the small rides I made in the beginning, the first big ride I made was that iron slide. And that was forty years ago. Video courtesy of Coleman Guyon / Luiz Romero FABRICA 2013 . His passion for building began forty years ago after a blacksmith told him he was too busy to help him craft four hooks and told him to do it himself . Humble beginnings: Bruno started with a few jugs of wine, some sausages and set up a tiny food stand underneath a tree to see if anyone would show up . 'At the time, it was big news. There were not many strange rides like that. And since then I continued building, getting bigger and bigger, until I built all of them. 'It's funny because I didn't expect it. I didn't imagine it would be such a great success.' In the documentary, he ruminates on the future of his beloved park as he contemplates retirement. He said: 'I wish it would keep running like this. 'There's an Italian proverb that says, ""you shouldn't change a winning horse"", but I can't impose my ideas on my successors, because everyone has a different point of view. I will leave it up to them.' The documentary can be seen at Gizmodo. Ai Pioppi, helped by the fame of the amusement park, grew from a food stand selling sausages to a 500-seat restaurant . Bruno hopes that whoever takes over the restaurant will keep the park running .","Bruno started Ai Poppi in 1969 and discovered a passion for metalwork through a chance encounter .

"By . Margot Peppers . PUBLISHED: . 16:31 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 16:31 EST, 6 November 2013 . A woman has opened up about desperately trying to untangle herself from her ex-husband, who continues to exert his control over her by manipulating Jewish law. Gital Dodelson, 25, wrote in the New York Post that she divorced her husband Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012, but she has spent the last four years trying to get him to grant her a 'get' - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law. Without it, 'men can't even look at me,' explains the law student. 'Under the eyes of God, I'm still married, chained to someone who refuses to release me back into society.' Gital Dodelson, 25, divorced her husband Avrohom Meir Weiss in 2012, he refuses to grant her a 'get' - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law . The mother-of-one from Lakewood, New Jersey, explained that her husband - whom she says has always been a controlling man - comes from a respected rabbinic family, making it all the more difficult to loosen herself from his power. After numerous attempts to reach an agreement, all met with the same defiance, Ms Dodelson has decided to make her story public in an effort to move on with her life. She says she saw signs that Mr Weiss would be a difficult husband just three days into their marriage in 2009, when they spent their first Shabbat together in complete silence. Explaining that the observance is typically a female tradition, she says he lost his temper when she was telling him how it was done in her family. 'When my way contradicted his way, he criticized me and turned angry,' she writes. Her husband then told her: 'You have . no choice. It's not my way' - an attitude he was to exhibit consistently . over the following four years. 'Under the eyes of God, I'm still married, chained to someone who refuses to release me' Not only did he have the final say when it came to religious observances, but he also had control over how their shared finances were used, even though Ms Dodelson was the sole breadwinner. When she suggested couples therapy, he refused, and every attempt to communicate was met with silence and hostility. It was when she became pregnant that she decided to take a stand against her overbearing other half. 'I thought: ""How can I bring a child into this world with a virtual stranger? Someone I'm so disconnected from?""' she says. Refusing to grant a get is viewed in Jewish law as domestic abuse, but Mr Weiss has said he will sign only if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $350,000 - a fee she simply can't afford . Mr Weiss ultimately granted her a divorce - after first attempting to file for sole custody of their son Aryeh - but he still won't sign a get, despite her pleas. By refusing to give her a get, Mr Weiss is merely continuing to exert his power over her, says Rabbi Jeremy Stern, executive director of the Organization for the Resolution of Agunot. This is further reinforced by the fact that refusing to issue a get is viewed in Jewish law as domestic abuse. 'When my way contradicted his way, he criticized me and turned angry' What's more, as a man Mr Weiss is free to date other woman openly, while his ex-wife is stuck in limbo in her community, where it would be considered adultery for her to move on romantically without a get. For his part, Mr Weiss appears to be fully aware of his own manipulative nature. During Ms Dodelson's most recent attempt to convince him about a month ago, he apparently said to her: 'I can't give you a get - how else would I control you?' The only conditions by which he says he would sign the get, according to SetGidalFree.com, would be if she rearranged the custody arrangement and gave him $350,000 - a fee she simply can't afford. 'On paper, I am a free woman,' she writes. 'But this means nothing in halacha, and I'm still imprisoned by my husband to this day.'","Gita Dodelson is legally divorced from Avrohom Meir Weiss, but he refuses to give her a get - the document that must be signed by a husband for a divorce to be recognized by Jewish law .

Beeching's axe fell in 1965, leaving it to the care of its station . master who purchased it for just £800. Mr Short, who also acted as signalman, . bought the station and all its buildings - including the engine shed and . goods warehouse - and chose not to change a thing. Richard Landale, of Sale & Partners, who is handling the sale of the station and its three acres of land, said: 'In parts Norham appears to still be a working station, so much has been preserved. 'It is a testimony to the quality of the original building, as well as the love and care of Mr and Mrs Short, who bought the station when it closed, and restored it.' Tracks: The platforms on either side of the station still remain with the benches and lights in tact . Tracks: The station stood on a 23-mile stretch of track which served the border town of Coldstream and the a number of communities in rural Northumberland . The original signal box still remains on the site, but has not been used for around 60 years . Controls: The signal box still contains the old levers which would transfer locomotives across the tracks and guide them into the small station . Waiting: This photo from the station's early years shows men, women and children ready to board an approaching train . Single or return? Owners could use the Station Masters office where nothing has moved since its closure, every detail from tickets, lost property forms and the Station Master's glass still remain . Untouched: A ticket which has been left on the desk since 1965 shows a journey from Marylebone Station in London and a pair of glasses and a pipe used by the ticket inspector . Office: Papers lay strewn around the old station master's desk while a jacket remains hanging in the window . Attachment: The last station master, Peter Short, did not want to his old workplace go to waste, so bought the site in 1970 for just £800, he has since passed away . Authority: The station master would have gone through his daily routine wearing this hat, which has become slightly frayed since the station's closure . Ewan Harris, a partner at the firm, added: 'This is a unique and rare opportunity to purchase a perfectly preserved railway station. 'Stations do come up for sale from time to time, but never with as much property or land attached, nor as well preserved. 'Not only is this a home, it is also a piece of history, and it is unlikely there is another station similar in the whole country.' Norham . Station was built in 1851 and stands on the North East Railway Line . that ran from Tweedmouth in England, across the border to Sprouston . Junction, Kelso, in Scotland. Brought . about by the Newcastle & Berwick Railway Act of 1845, the 23-mile . track served the border town of Coldstream and the rural communities all . along the route. Its one claim to fame arrived in 1948 when the East . Coast Main Line was flooded and for three months, through the autumn, . express trains were diverted along the branch, including The Flying . Scotsman. The Shorts, who . showed visitors around the free-to-enter museum they ran until its . closure in 2010, described it as 'a lovely, happy little station' where . milk churns arrived each morning, goods were delivered for local shops . and parcels for the villagers. Hut: A shovel lies against the wall of the porter's cabin, which has not been used in almost 50 years . Delivery: Old receipts detailing where parcels and post would be send remain stamped and in their pigeon holes . Controversial: Richard Beeching holding one of the reports which would lead to the closure of thousands of railway stations across the country in the 1960s . When British railways reached their peak at the end of the First World War, they faced increasing competition from the road networks and car manufacturers who were selling more affordable vehicles. Therefore Dr Richard Beeching was brought in to restructure the rail network in order to save money. The two reports, published in 1963 and 1965, identified 2,363 stations — one-third of those in the network — and around 6,000 miles of track to be closed. The publications set out in stark terms how nearly half of the nation’s 7,000 railway stations generated only 2 per cent of the total rail traffic, while one-third of the entire track carried just one per cent of the traffic. Two-thirds of the rolling stock was not used all the year round. One extreme example of this under-use highlighted by Beeching was in Norfolk, where the line between Thetford and Swaffham carried an  average of only nine passengers on five trains a day. Not surprisingly, his proposal sparked outrage from commuters, local councils and the trade unions, who were appalled at the talk of 70,000 job losses. Route: The discarded tickets was from a passenger who took a journey from South Shilbottle Colliery to Norham Station . Toys: A large model railway was built inside the booking office to make the property perfect for any train enthusiast . Decor: Milk churns, a trailer and a collection of posters from the 1960's adorn the outside of the station building which leads out onto the platform . Danger: A sign next to the station warns passengers against going on the track, but the fine is relatively cheap by today's standards . Family: Sandra (left) and Amanda Short, daughter's of the station's final station master Peter, said they had fond memories of the station growing up . Exterior: The Shorts, standing outside the front of the house, said they would prefer a rail enthusiast to buy the site to keep it as it is . History: This family photo of the Shorts show how it has been a part of their family for decades . Profit: Following the death of their father in 2008, they are looking to sell the station for £420,000, which was bought for £800 in 1970 .","Norham Station in Northumberland comes complete with its original signal box, waiting room and platform .

Au naturelle: Victoria Beckham is thought to have chosen teardrop-shaped implants for her second operation . Evolutionary theorists call them ‘sexual ornaments’. According to  academics, the human female bosom is unique among primates. While ape species have large breasts only during lactation, the same isn’t true for us. And as they remain after menopause, they are not an indicator of fertility. So, look away now feminists... the way they look mainly serves to attract a mate. Thus, women have always drawn attention to their busts with padding, corsetry, or simply by going topless. Today, the boob job is the most . commonly performed cosmetic surgery, with more than 10,000 British women . having one last year. And as The Mail on Sunday reported last week, British breast implant manufacturer Nagor claim one in ten patients now opts for a ‘super boob job,’ increasing their bust by four or more cup sizes in a single operation. However, many women still want a more discreet option dubbed the ‘has she or hasn’t she’ boob job. Miles . Berry, a plastic surgeon and co-author of the Good Boob Bible, says: . ‘Victoria Beckham epitomises the new trend. 'She has never admitted to . surgery, but pictures show  her breasts are incredibly supple and full – . better than in her youth.’ Despite . technological and surgical advances, there are still pitfalls when . trying to choose the perfect pair. Here, experts advise how to get it . just right. IGNORE CUP SIZE . Size . is dictated by the volume of the implant and measured in cubic . centimetres (a 151cc to 250cc implant will give around a one to two-cup . size increase). If you are looking for a natural-looking boob job, . consultant plastic surgeon Patrick Mallucci  recommends forgetting about . cup size altogether. ‘Don’t . come in saying, “I am a B and I’d like to be a DD”. Cup size is highly . subjective. I might see 20 women measuring 34C, all with completely . different breasts,’ he explains. Ultimately you want a breast which is . in proportion and the right implant that will achieve that. THE PERFECT SHAPE . In . 2011, Mallucci analysed the mathematical factors of attractive breasts, . using 100 Page 3 models, all of whom had real breasts, as research . material. The resulting . formula revealed a template for both surgeons and women considering . surgery: 45 per cent of breast volume is above the nipple; the nipple . points upwards at an average angle of 20 degrees; the upper half is . either straight or concave, and the lower half a neat, full curve. Back in the days: There was no mistaking that Victoria Beckham had a boob job eight years ago, but later had her 'chest oranges', right, swapped for a more natural looking implant . Mallucci says: ‘The dimensions are a template, whether you are simply enlarging or lifting as well.’ That said, the desire is normally to have bigger breasts. If you want a natural-looking boob job which is aesthetically ideal, there are limitations depending on your frame and anatomy. ‘The surgeon ought to measure the width of your breast to select the implant size,’ he says. Too big a width means the implant shows on top of the rib cage. ‘As long as you stick to this rule you are close to achieving the perfect shape. Too large will never look natural.’ PROJECT YOURSELF . ‘Projection, or pertness, of the breasts is down to the shape of the implant itself,’ says consultant plastic surgeon Fazel Fatah. ‘There are different silhouettes – low, medium, high or extra-high.’ ‘The patient’s physiology must be taken into account. A 20-year-old with a flat chest couldn’t have an extra high projection as the skin would be too stretched,’ Fatah adds. ‘Under-filling is equally disastrous as it will make the skin sag around the implant,’ says Mallucci. ‘Post-pregnancy, you may have a deflated breast. The more skin laxity, the more projection is necessary.’ Another important consideration is breast tissue and skin quality. ‘Older or post-pregnancy skin  may be very thin,’ says Mallucci. ‘You don’t want the implant to  show underneath.’ ROUNDING UP . A round shape accounts for 82 per cent of implants in Britain. The other option is a teardrop-shaped implant. Fazel Fatah explains: ‘The round implant looks fuller at the top, while the teardrop slopes downwards like a natural breast. ‘Not many people have the teardrop because the surgical technique has to be very precise to avoid the implant rotating within the breast. It takes longer in theatre and the implant itself costs more, so the option is more expensive.’ There can be a £1,000 difference. Popular op: More than 10,000 British women had plastic surgery on their chest last year . TRY BEFORE YOU BUY . Some surgeons offer 3D imaging, but usually surgeons suggest ‘trying out’ new breasts by wearing a larger bra filled with an implant. ‘British women want fullness at the top, or the Wonder-Bra effect,’ says Mallucci. ‘But if the breasts stay that shape when naked, they’ll look a bit weird. This means limiting volume in the upper bust. You can still wear an enhancing bra afterwards.’ SAFETY FIRST . ‘Women should be as informed as possible about exactly what goes into their bodies,’ says consultant plastic and reconstructive surgeon Michael Cadier. The most important factor is not the type of implant, but the safety record. European legislation isn’t particularly stringent, but the US regulator, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has approved five brands of implant. ‘Should your surgeon not suggest one with FDA approval then there ought to be good safety data demonstrated in the form of long-term clinical follow-ups of a minimum of five years, looking at the integrity of the implant and effects on the body,’ says Berry. A BOOB JOB IS FOR LIFE . ‘The body forms scar tissue around the implant. This fibrous bag usually starts to contract after a decade, and the breast may look unnatural. If it becomes unevenly shaped it may have ruptured,’ says Berry. However, as long as you have a decent implant there are no serious concerns should this happen. ‘Women often only find out about rupture when they go for a mammogram at 50,’ he adds. Once you know they’re broken, they ought to be removed. Many women need reductions too. ‘This is why a size eight woman wanting to have massive breasts is going to be in trouble,’ says Fatah. ‘The breast tissue will be very thin and when they are replaced she may be left with sagging breasts.’","A breast enlargement is the most common plastic surgery in Britain .

A grade I listed manor where Oliver Cromwell's daughter Elizabeth once lived with her husband has been put on the market for £1,800,000. The political leader frequently visited Northborough Manor, Peterborough, to see his favourite daughter and husband John Claypole who first moved into the property after the English Civil War - which ended in 1651. According to some reports, Cromwell even spent a Christmas at the Manor, which comprises of two buildings - a eight-bedroom main manor and a separate four-bedroom Gatehouse. For sale: Northborough Manor, where Elizabeth Cromwell and her husband John Claypole lived after the English Civil War, is for sale for £1.8million . Historical: The grade one listed, 14th century manor comprises of two properties - the main house, pictured, and a separate Gatehouse . Welcome: Visitors to the property, about seven miles from Peterborough, enter through the Gatehouse, pictured, and park in the courtyard - seen through the arch . Heritage: Both properties were built in between 1333 and 1336 by William de Eyton for Roger de Norburgh, who received the estate in the 14th Century . During his visit, he slept in a room now referred to as 'Cromwell's closet'. His wife - also called Elizabeth - later died in that very room. According to the current owners, the ghost of Elizabeth has reportedly been seen walking in the courtyard at midnight - but they say they have never experienced any ghostly encounters. The historical property also has links to US, as John Claypole's brothers were involved in the early settlement of the state of Pennsylvania - recognised in 1975 by the Govenor of the State who presented a flag to be flown at the property. Now on the market for £1.8m, estate agents Smiths Gore say the property has been popular with those interested in period homes with a wealth of historical background. Architectural: The property has numerous feature windows and doors, pictured, that would have originally be installed in the early 1300s . Expansive: The main property, lived in by the Claypoles who acquired the Manor in the 1600s, boasts a fabulous two-storey dining room called the Great Hall . Links: In the Great Hall, the state flag of Pennsylvania is flown, pictured, after it was presented to the family in 1975 because of links between the Claypoles and the state . Cosy: Coming off the dining hall, pictured right, is the home's library - stocked with books, stored on floor-to-ceiling shelves . Ornate: The Manor's large sitting and entertaining room, pictured, called The Solar has been popular with people viewing the historical building . They added that they have shown a number of clients round the property - which boasts a library, beautifully kept 1.5-acre gardens including a 16th century Dovecote and stables - many of whom are city-types who wish to commute to London. The stunning property, with features a 'great hall' used as a formal dining room, is 10 miles from the Georgian market town of Stamford, while Peterborough mainline station is seven miles away. The property is currently lived in by John and Jane Trevor who are down-sizing as their children have now grown up. They said: 'We fell in love with the property and the history behind it. It is very rare these days to find a home with so much historical background attached to it. Culinary: The property has a relatively modest farm-house style kitchen with room for a dining table, should prospective buyers not fancy eating in the Great Hall . Upstairs: The home's master bedroom features original beams, beautifully renovated by architect Roy Genders in the seventies . Modest: Meanwhile over at The Gatehouse, the dining area is substantially less palatial, but still echos the distinctive style of the property . 'We have loved living here but now we are too old and our children are grown ups. 'There are stories that Elizabeth - Cromwell's widow - walks the courtyard at midnight. But we have never experienced it. It's rubbish. This is the friendliest house in the country and a wonderful place to live.' The Manor was built between 1333 and 1336 by Roger de Norburgh who received the Estate in early 14th Century. Wealthy de Norburgh was Chancellor of Cambridge University, Canon of Lincoln and Hereford and Bishop of Litchfield and Coventry. Although the manor was not his official residence, he built the property to be what was in effect a Bishop's Palace. Fit for any serviceman: The sitting room in The Gatehouse, which would have originally been built for the estate's staff . Private: The home has around 1.5-acres of secluded gardens that have been kept to a very high standard . Estate: As well as stables, the grounds, which are enclosed, also featuer a Dovecote built in the 1500s by the Claypole family . Peaceful: The property was originally bought by the Claypole family in 1572, but John and Elizabeth did not move in until after the Civil War . Special visitor: A portrait of Oliver Cromwell who is said to have regularly visited the manor to stay with his daughter and in-laws . It is thought that William de Eyton, the Master Mason and Architect of Litchfield Cathedral, built the Manor. Over the next 200 years, it was passed between owners before it was bought by James Claypole in 1572. Claypole extended the Gatehouse for his staff and built the Dovecots. He also built a tomb in the local church before his death in 1599. It was his great grandson, also called John, that married Elizabeth Cromwell during the Civil War in 1646. After the war, which ended in 1651, Elizabeth and John moved to Northborough to live with the Claypoles. Cronwell visited the couple regularly there - spending one Christmas at the Manor as he and John's father were old friends. One of the rooms is now called 'Cromwell's Closet' - a room over the south porch - as he slept in the room while visiting. After Oliver died in 1658, his widow - also called Elizabeth - moved to live at the Manor. She is thought to have died in 1665 in 'Cromwell's Closet.' John Claypole's brothers Edward, James and Norton emigrated and played a role in the early settlement of the state of Pennsylvania. The link to Northborough was recognised . officially by the Governor of the State in 1975 when the State flag was . presented to be flown at the Manor. One of the Claypole brother's descendents was a friend of George Washington. He is thought to have printed the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the Unites States and Washington's Farewell Address to the American People. John Claypole sold the Manor before his death in 1688. The Manor eventually became a farmhouse and was restored to its current glory in the early 1970s by architect Roy Genders. After the English Civil War, which ended in 1651, Elizabeth and John moved to Northborough to live with the older members of the Claypole family. Former Prime Minister Cromwell visited the couple regularly there - spending a Christmas at the Manor. It is thought that as well as the obvious family links, he and John's father were old friends.

Middle-aged women who eat a Mediterranean diet are more likely to live healthier and longer lives, a new study has found. Women who follow a diet rich in fruit, vegetables and fish, which is closely associated with the traditional Mediterranean diet, were less likely to suffer from major chronic diseases and physical ailments. They were also found to be 40 per cent more likely to live past the age of 70. Time to make a lifestyle change? A new study has found women on a Mediterranean diet are 40% more likely to live past 70 . Lead researcher Cecilia Samieri, a postdoctoral fellow who conducted the study while at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, said: 'We found that greater quality of diet at midlife was strongly associated with increased odds of good health and well-being among individuals surviving to older ages. 'Women with healthier dietary patterns at midlife were 40 per cent more likely to survive to age 70 or over. 'Maintaining physical, cognitive, and mental health with aging may provide a more powerful incentive for dietary change than simply prolonging life or avoiding any single chronic disease.' Ms Samieri, who is now a researcher at INSERM and Universite de Bordeaux, in France, added that those on a Mediterranean diet were more likely to be classed as 'healthy agers' although only 11 per cent of participants were classified as healthy agers overall. Back to basics: A typical Mediterranean diet is rich in fruit, vegetables, fish, chicken and olive oil but is low in red meats and saturated fat . Ms Samieri and her colleagues evaluated the diet and medical records of more than 10,000 women in their late 50s or early 60s who took part in a larger Nurses’ Health Study between 1984 and 1986. They then asked the same women about their health an average of 15 years later. Ms Samieri described the Mediterranean diet as being characterized by a greater intake of fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grains and fish; a lower intake of red and processed meats; moderate intake of alcohol; higher amounts of monounsaturated fats, mostly provided by olive oil from Mediterranean countries; and lower amounts of saturated fats. The researcher believes the diet would have a similar impact on men. But the director of university nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis, Connie Diekman, pointed out the study is only observational, telling health.com: 'Cause and effect cannot be exclusively linked'. The study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute and the U.S. National Institutes of Health, will be published this month in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.","Study evaluated the diet and medical records of more than 10,000 women .

A husband has saved his bride’s life by giving her one of his kidneys - after she discovered she needed a transplant on the eve of their wedding. Sarah Dalton, from Dublin, faced years of gruelling dialysis, as her life hung in the balance while she waited for a kidney donor. But her husband, Conor, 31, offered to donate his own kidney, and the pair underwent the lifesaving surgery together. Sarah Dalton was told she needed a kidney transplant the day before her wedding to Conor. When no deceased donor could be found, Mr Dalton offered his wife one of his kidneys . Mrs Dalton said: ‘I don’t know how I’ll ever repay Conor for what he’s done for me. ‘He’s the most generous person I know and I could not have asked for a better gift. ‘He’s changed, and saved, my life - he’s one in a million.’ Mrs Dalton was diagnosed with a kidney condition known as reflux nephropathy when she was a child. The condition means the tubes from her kidneys to her bladder are positioned wrongly so they allow urine to flow back up from the bladder to the kidneys. After receiving her first kidney transplant at the age of 17 the music teacher had hoped she could put her health problems behind her. But on the day before her wedding in 2011, she was told that her donated kidney was beginning to fail. Mrs . Dalton said: ‘I had a hospital appointment the day before I married . Conor and I was more or less told that I would need a new kidney. Mrs Dalton received a new kidney from her husband last month and the couple are now recovering at home. Mrs Dalton said: 'I can't begin to describe what an incredible thing Conor has done for me' ‘I knew the donated kidney wouldn’t last forever but it was still such a shock. ‘I was preparing for the best day of my life and to receive such horrible news was devastating.’ After the wedding, Mrs Dalton began to deteriorate quickly, and soon the newlywed was put onto dialysis whilst she waited for a donor. She said: ‘Going on dialysis was very difficult - I was a young woman, newly married, but I had to spend every night hooked up to a machine, it was horrible. ‘While I was on dialysis we’d been given some information about organ donation, and it mentioned living donors - Conor offered himself up straight away.’ Although the waiting time for a deceased donor was three to four years, the wait for a living donor was just six months. Mr Dalton said: ‘As soon as I realised I could give Sarah my kidney, I volunteered. ‘I didn’t give it a second thought - she’s my wife, and if I was able to help her, then I was going to do it. Mrs Dalton has reflux nephropathy which means the tubes to her bladder are positioned wrongly - they allow urine to flow back from her bladder to her kidneys . ‘They tested Sarah’s closest family members first, as they prefer a genetic match, but her mum wasn’t a match, her younger sister is too young, and her older brother is all the way in Australia. ‘Her Dad was a match, but as I’m younger and fitter, we all decided it would be better for me to go ahead with the donation.’ While Mr Dalton was more than prepared to give his wife his kidney, Mrs Dalton was more worried. She said: ‘I was reluctant to let him at first. ‘I love my husband very much but I worried about the future and what would happen if we ever split up. ‘I didn’t want to put him through unnecessary surgery either. ‘It took me a while to come to terms with it.’ Reflux nephropathy is a kidney disease in which urine passes back up from the bladder towards the kidneys instead of leaving the body. Nearly all cases of the disease result from an abnormality that develops before birth. The abnormality means one or both of the drainage tubes from the kidneys to the bladder enter the bladder at the wrong angle. As a result, when the bladder contracts to pass urine outwards, the tubes are not pinched off meaning some urine goes back up towards the kidneys. The most common symptom of reflux nephropathy is frequent urine infections. About one in 100 children have some degree of reflux of urine but in nine out of 10 cases it causes no problems and disappears on its own during childhood.

Mr Dalton, a solicitor, was at work when he received a call from the transplant coordinator to tell him they could do the transplant three days later, in October this year. He said: ‘I had just been chatting to my boss at work about the transplant when I got the call. ‘I was telling him that the odds of having the operation soon were pretty low - but then I took a call and was told it was going to happen in the next few days. ‘I couldn’t believe it.’ Mrs Dalton added: ‘After we got the call it was all a bit of a blur. ‘We went straight into hospital and Conor had two days worth of tests to make sure he was healthy enough to go ahead. ‘Then the day came for the surgery. He went down three hours before me, which was pretty scary. ‘That’s when the enormity of it all dawned on me really - I was very tearful but I knew he was in good hands. ‘Then I went into the anaesthetist’s room - there was just enough time for them to tell me that Conor’s surgery had gone well and there was a healthy kidney for me, before I was out of it. ‘The next thing I knew, I was wheeled back up to the ward and Conor was waiting for me.’ Three days after the surgery Mr Dalton left hospital, closely followed by his wife just two days later. The pair are now recovering well at home. He said: ‘This operation has changed our lives. ‘Before, Sarah was ill all the time, and she was always tired and unwell. ‘Now it’s like she’s got a new lease of life. ‘She’s my wife and I love her very much - to know that she’s healthy now and I’ll have her with me for a long time to come, is just amazing.’ Mrs Dalton said: ‘I can’t begin to describe what an incredible thing Conor has done for me. ‘He’s given me my life back - and my parents think he’s the best son in law ever!’","Sarah Dalton has reflux nephropathy - condition occurs when tubes to the bladder are positioned wrongly so allow urine to pass back to the kidneys .

This is thought to be because of increasing rates of childhood obesity . Girls are going through puberty earlier and earlier, a new study has found. This is thought to be because of increasing rates of childhood obesity. U.S. researchers have found that white girls start to develop breasts at about nine and a half - a few months earlier than in the 1990s. African American girls, on the other hand, now start to develop breasts just before they turn nine, on average. The researchers studied data from 1,200 American girls who were enrolled in the study between the ages of six and eight. At each check-up, experts assessed the girls’ breast development. They found African American girls first show signs of breast development at eight years and 10 months, on average. Hispanic girls first show signs of breast development at nine years and four months on average, and white and Asian girls at nine years and eight months. For white girls, they found that puberty is now hitting about four months earlier than in a 1997 study that also measured breast development. They also discovered that heavier girls tend to start developing breasts at a younger age. As a result, Dr Frank Biro and his colleagues at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Centre in Ohio wrote in the journal Paediatrics that rising obesity rates seem to be a ‘prime driver’ behind breast development starting earlier. There are a number of theories as to why obesity might be linked to earlier onset of puberty. Researchers at Oregon State University believe it could be because diet plays havoc with the body clock which, in turn, changes the balance of hormones in the body. Another theory is that carrying excess fat tissue encourages the body to produces hormones which kick start puberty. However, Dr Anders Juul, head of the Department of Growth and Reproduction at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark, has carried out research which suggests obesity is not behind the earlier development of breasts. He believes exercise levels and chemicals in the environment play a role in causing the onset of puberty. African American girls now start to develop breasts just before they turn nine, on average, while white girls start to develop breasts at about nine and a half. This is a few months earlier than in the 1990s . The researchers believe that maturing at a younger age could come with long-term risks for some girls. For instance, those who hit puberty earlier could be at higher risk of breast and other cancers because their bodies spend more years making, and being exposed to, oestrogen. They also tend to start having sex or using drugs and alcohol at younger ages and are more likely to become depressed or develop low self-esteem, they said. ‘You've got a 10-year-old who looks like a 14-year-old. We interact with kids based on the way that they look,’ Dr Biro said. ‘Kids interact with each other that way also.’ ‘One of the things the parents of these early maturing kids need to do is they need to monitor them more closely,’ he told Reuters Health. ‘That includes talking about sex earlier.’ But Dr Juul said parents shouldn't be overly worried ,as the data about early puberty and problems down the line come from studies that asked women when they first got their period and this was not measured in this study. ‘I think the scary part is not (for) the actual girl, because we don't know what it means for her,’ he told Reuters Health. ‘It is a warning that something is influencing our child population and it calls for concern and continued studies.’","African American girls now start to develop breasts at eight years and ten months, on average, and white girls at nine years and eight months .

Two men who ran a 'sophisticated' forgery factory which produced passports, cash, bank cards and an array of official documents have been jailed. Belkacem Lakehal, 41, and Mohand Said Mouchache, 45, who have dual British and Algerian nationality, previously pleaded guilty to various offences following an investigation by detectives from the Metropolitan Police. Sentencing the pair at London’s Snaresbrook Crown Court, Judge Joanna Korner said: 'This was a well planned and well executed operation that is shown clearly by the type of equipment and the number of documents and also by the orders that were being placed for these documents. Forgery: Mohand Said Mouchache, 45, left, and Belkacem Lakehal, 41, right, have been jailed . 'Such documents, even if the passports or ID documents could not be used to facilitate entry or exit into the country, they could clearly be used for fraud or for money laundering and as a consequence the gaining of employment to which the person in possession of these forged documents was not entitled. 'As far as the income which was generated, it is hard to say, but clearly it was a profitable enterprise.' The pair were arrested on April 17 following a four-month operation that led officers to their hub in Tavistock Road, South Woodford, east London. Police entered the address to find Mouchache in the process of making forged UK residence permits on a desktop computer. Further searches there found commercial standard paper and card printers, precision cutting laminating equipment and all the raw materials with which to make false identity documents. A photo issued by Metropolitan police showed a bag of fake coins made by the pair . Police released photos of some of the fake passports involved in the scam, described as 'highly illegal' More than 130 partially complete forged passports for a number of EU countries, forged driving licences for various EU countries and numerous National Insurance number cards were uncovered. Also in the room was a 'kit' to manufacture counterfeit £1 coins including lead ingots, casting moulds and an electro-plating tank, as well as a total of 1,896 cast lead counterfeit £1 coins. The computer that was being used by Mouchache was found to contain more than 6,500 images and programmes relating to the manufacture of false identity documents. More than £20,000 in cash was also seized from the searched premises.

Both defendants pleaded guilty to conspiring with each other and others unknown to make false passports for use in fraud and to a charge of conspiring with each other and others unknown to make false National Insurance cards and other identity documents for use in fraud. Lakehal also admitted conspiring to make counterfeit £1 coins, while Mouchache pleaded guilty to conspiring to make false bank cards for use in fraud. Each had been charged with the other offence their co-defendant pleaded guilty to, but the counts were ordered to lie on file. Lakehal, of South Woodford, was jailed for five years for each count, to run concurrently, while Mouchache, of Southwark, was jailed for four years for each concurrently, which the judge said took his earlier guilty plea into account. Both defendants were described as 'family men' of previous good character with no criminal convictions. Detective Inspector Sarah Davies said: 'This was a sophisticated network, supplying a vast number of forged documents to organised criminals, enabling them to commit crime and operate with the appearance of legitimacy. 'Thousands of documents and computer files were examined and catalogued and such was the quality of the evidence presented, Mouchache and Lakehal had little option but to plead guilty. 'Hopefully this conviction will send a strong message to others engaged in this type of criminality that the Metropolitan Police Service is determined to stamp out forgery and identity crime to keep our communities safer.'","Belkacem Lakehal, 41, and Mohand Said Mouchache, 45, were 'family men'

When the Duchess of Cambridge was . pictured with unflattering streaks of grey last week, it was a marked . contrast with her normally immaculate look. It was also a clue to the trendy colouring technique that attracted attention at Prince George’s christening. Today, The . Mail on Sunday has revealed that she has been having a £350 colouring . treatment known as balayage – a technique that involves ‘painting’ the . hair with ammonia-free dye to give a natural look. Balayage: The Duchess of Cambridge has adopted a new hassle-free beauty regime of ammonia-free hair dye . Blonde disciples: Sienna Miller (left) and Kate Moss (right) are fans of balayage. The French style, which means 'to sweep', was made in the 1970s for blonde hair, which reacts more readily to the hand-painted bleach . It is popular with celebrities including Kate Moss and Sienna Miller. But, . as last week’s pictures make clear, balayage colour can fade quickly on . brunettes – and Kate has already summoned her hairdresser for a . touch-up. The trend was invented in France in the 1970s - although it didn't take off in Britain until 2008. Translating as 'to sweep', the free-hand strokes of bleach painted onto a woman's hair is designed to give a style of movement that block colour cannot. Chocolate brown: Throughout her life as a student at St Andrews, Kate's hair was a block shade of dark brown . Uniform: The Duchess's hair was immaculately uniform when she announced her engagement . Brunette balayage: Julia Roberts (left) and Sarah Jessica Parker (right) have used it to give their hair shape . It was originally only done for blondes, whose hair is more sensitive to the dye and more readily shows the effects. But as demand soared, stylists worked to develop different techniques which work for brown hair. As pictures of Kate captured this week, brunettes are still resilient to bleach as dark hair takes longer to react. And . balayage, designed for natural hair, is not the ideal way to cover . already existing roots. Kate has been topping up her chocolate brown . locks for years. Impeccably . placed sources have whispered that the Duchess had, to her then horror, . started finding the odd stray grey (‘stress highlights’, her friends . joke) before her pregnancy. When the technique crept onto catwalks . five years ago, beauty blogs and fashion magazines lauded it as 'the . working woman's dream'. It is low maintenance, deliberately uneven, and lasts longer. After three appointments, only a toner and freshener is required, rather than the full treatment. Compared . to normal dye, when balayage grows out there is not a clear line of . roots, meaning women can be more flexible with their appointments. To combat these, she had organic vegetable-based dye and subtle low-lights applied during regular four-hour visits to the Richard Ward Hair And Metrospa in Chelsea. Evidently, Kate has let these sessions slip - not many new mothers, even royal ones, can spare four hours at the salon when they've got a four-month-old to look after. 'Going grey marks nature’s way of softening the hair colour giving natural highlights as the skin pigmentation changes,' says Galvin Jr. 'I always recommend using a semi-permanent colour with no ammonia or peroxide, to blend the grey hair and tone it down slightly.' However, Kate may want to avoid any unnecessary chemicals: it could be that she's being very cautious about dying her hair while pregnant or breastfeeding. Many women stop colouring their hair during pregnancy, with some waiting until at least 12 weeks after the birth of their baby to begin again. This is for fear of the chemicals used in many dyes being passed to the baby through breast-feeding.","Balayage, a French beauty technique created in 1970s, means 'to sweep'

The parents of a schoolgirl who died when she was knocked over in her school playground have called for a nationwide ban on the game of British bulldogs. Freya James, aged eight, was hurt when a pupil hurled into her playing the rough, tag-based game in her playground. She fell onto an ornamental feature made from a railway sleeper. Tragedy: Freya James, eight, died after allegedly bumping into another child in the playground at Trafalgar School in Twickenham, Middlesex . Despite her serious stomach injury, staff at her primary school then made her walk up to six metres to a first aid room, it is claimed. Freya, who had a ruptured liver, was rushed to hospital after the lunchtime incident in February. She died two hours later without her family having the chance to say goodbye. Yesterday her parents Nick and Anekke James, from Twickenham, Middlesex, blamed the fast-moving playground game for her death. Mr James, 42, said : ‘I hope our daughter’s death will lead to a more widespread ban.’ The businessman, who runs a cabinet making firm, described their daughter as ‘an Angel loved by everybody’ in the days after her death. Yesterday he said: ‘When you go through the sequence of events, you’ve got a boy running at high speed in a crowded playground and you’ve got a wooden sleeper serving no purpose. ‘Freya was also made to walk five or six metres to a first aid room - despite holding her abdomen when teachers found her on the ground. ‘We need to know if that caused more serious damage. There are a lot of questions that need answering.’ The family claim that staff at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham never apologised nor accepted responsibility. In a statement in February, the family said: ‘She was a bundle of energy from the time she woke up to the time she went to bed. She was so strong and determined in everything she did and always tried to help those that struggled. Too rough: Parents Nick and Anneke James have condemned the rough game played at Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, west London (pictured) ‘Our princess has gone but we know her spirit and her memories will always be with us. Our lives have been absolutely shattered. ‘Our hearts, bodies and souls are aching constantly and we are left with scars that will never heal.’ Dean Rogers, chairman of governors at the school, said: ‘This has been a horrendously difficult period for the staff as well as the children at the school. But we still couldn’t possibly comprehend what it has been like for Nick and Anekke. ‘We understand they feel angry and need answers and the inquest will hopefully give them those. ‘Ahead of the hearing, it would be inappropriate to comment further.’ Headmaster Neil Meehan said after the accident: ‘Our thoughts are with the parents and family of the pupil during this very sad time and we are working with educational psychologists to support pupils and staff at the school as necessary.’ Other primary schools have already banned children from playing rough playground games. In March this year Queensbridge Primary School in Hackney, east London, came under criticism from parents for banning children from playing tag, because the game was ‘too rough’. Lionel Hives, a father with children at the school, said at the time:‘All the evidence suggests exercise in the playground is an important part of children’s ability to focus on schoolwork for the rest of the day. We should be encouraging exercise, not curtailing it.’ Headteacher Sarah Bailey insisted the ban was needed because children ‘played it too roughly’. In 2009 Wood End primary school in Harpenden, Hertfordshire, were banned from playing football in the playground. The school told them: ‘Unfortunately, several pupils have been hit in the face by a football. ‘Therefore, due to health and safety reasons, football will no longer be allowed on the infant playground at break and lunch times due to restricted space.’","Freya James, 8, was knocked over playing British Bulldog in the courtyard of Trafalgar Junior School in Twickenham, west London .

US President John F Kennedy would have urged Britain to stay within the EU, former foreign secretary David Miliband has claimed. The ex-Labour MP made the bizarre suggestion in speech to mark the 50th anniversary of the assassination of the former president. Mr Miliband said he had 'no doubt' that JFK would argue that Britain should stay in the Europe Union and would back David Cameron’s call for a ‘deeper and stronger single market’. Prediction: David Miliband used his Kennedy Memorial Trust lecture to claim JFK would want Britain to stay in the EU . As the current occupant of the White House, President Barack Obama has warned that America wants ‘a strong UK in a strong EU’. The transatlantic debate about EU membership was triggered by Mr Cameron’s pledge to negotiate a fresh settlement with Brussels, before holding an in-out referendum by 2017. Delivering the Kennedy Memorial Lecture last night, Mr Miliband said JFK - a distant relation of former Tory Prime Minister Harold Macmillan - had a ‘deep affection’ for Britain. Speaking to an invited audience at the British Library, Mr Miliband, said: ‘He saw the assets that Britain brought and should still bring to the European project. I have no doubt he would want us there still.’ Pro-EU: President John F. Kennedy would argue that Eruope is about more than the euro, Mr Miliband claimed . Mr Miliband quit British politics after losing out on the Labour leadership to his brother Ed and is now president of the US-based International Rescue Committee. He added: ‘Sitting as I now do in New York, there is bafflement at the idea that Britain might leave an institution that costs £1 per week per British citizen - and never mind the indirect benefits the CBI has talked about. ‘It is taken as unhappy proof that we are thinking about opting out of the 21st century. ‘The warnings to Euro-sceptics from political and business leaders could not be clearer: opting out of Europe is your choice, but if you do that then you count yourselves out of the Transatlantic partnership too. ‘The message is simple: be very careful. You may end getting what you want and finding it was not what you wanted after all.’ A Tory-drafted Bill to pave the way for the 2017 referendum is being piloted through Parliament by MP James Wharton, and returns to the Commons this Friday. But Labour oppose the idea, arguing the call for a referendum at some point in the future creates uncertainty which could undermine investmentin the UK. During a Q&A session, Mr Miliband added: ‘I'm in the happy position to be able to say I support the Labour party position on this - if there is a fundamental shift in the balance of power between Brussels and Britain then there is an argument for referendum.’ It is vital that there is not a division in Europe between those for and against the Euro, said Mr Miliband. ‘JFK would argue that although the collapse of the euro would be a disaster for Europe, Europe is about so much more than the euro,’ he argued. Speech: Mr Miliband delivered the speech entitled 'America, Britain & Europe: Lessons from JFK', at the British Library Conference Centre . ‘In other words, JFK would surely be strongly opposed to a 'two-tier' Europe and make the case for an expansive European agenda for 28 members of the EU, not just 17, led by a strong European Commission. ‘This means a deeper and stronger single market, consistent with Prime Minister Cameron's speech in January 2013.’ Mr Cameron yesterday warned that British support for remaining in the European Union is now 'wafer thin'. He said the case had not been made to persuade voters not to sever ties with Brussels in the referendum he has promised by 2017. Warning: David Cameron told the CBI conference that the case had not yet been made to persuade voters to stay in the European Union . In a speech at the CBI annual conference, Mr Cameron said: 'The current consent for remaining inside the European Union is wafer thin. We haven't made the argument enough about why it matters. 'The argument I have made is not some short-term tactical ploy. It's a long-term strategy for Britain. 'What I've put forward, I believe, has the overwhelming support of the British people and business people too.'","Former British foreign secretary predicts views of John F Kennedy .

A motorist has been jailed for killing an elderly woman because she was distracted by revving her car in anger at two pedestrians who were crossing the road. Natalie Foulser pressed down on the accelerator because she thought a man and woman were walking deliberately slowly across a dual carriageway. The 21-year-old driver, who had only recently qualified, continued to stare at the pedestrians, meaning that she failed to see that great-grandmother Averil Monks was still using the crossing. Jailed: Natalie Foulser, left, has admitted killing Averil Monks, right, while driving carelessly in Lancashire . The 75-year-old former nurse died at the scene after being hit by Miss Foulser at 35mph on the 30mph road in Marton, Lancashire in June last year. The young woman was seen at the roadside in floods of tears, crying for her father and saying: 'I can't believe I've just killed someone.' Mrs Monks' widower George, 76, was left so devastated by his wife's death that he refused to sleep in their bedroom, and he died in August. Foulser, an artist from Fleetwood, was cleared of causing death by dangerous driving but admitted the lesser charge of causing death by careless driving. She sobbed at Burnley Crown Court last Friday as she was sentenced to eight months in prison and banned from driving for two years. Guilty: Foulser, pictured arriving at Burnley Crown Court, was revving her car to rebuke two pedestrians . The court heard that Foulser was driving her black and orange Honda Civic in the outside lane of the dual carriageway at the time of the incident. As she approached the crossing she saw two pedestrians who she thought were walking 'deliberately slowly', so she revved the engine loudly. Prosecutor Paul Cummings said as she reached the crossing she was still staring at the two pedestrians, just missing them as they stepped onto the pavement. It was only when she turned back to the road that she saw Mrs Monks in the road, by which time it was too late to avoid a collision. Witness Gail Miller said: 'I noticed a female on the central reservation who was very upset, I believed her to be the driver of the vehicle involved. I went to her and tried to assist her and calm her down. 'She said, ""Two kids were messing about around the junction. I revved my engine to scare them because they were messing about"".' David Marsden, a driving instructor, added: 'The female driver of the car was in hysterics on the central reservation and was screaming, ""I want my dad"". She then said either ""it revved"" or ""I revved it"".' Sobbing: Foulser was seen crying by the side of the road following the collision in June last year . The two pedestrians involved also gave evidence - Coral Bawden said: 'Just after the crash I did see the driver get out of the car in a distressed state and I heard her say, ""I can't believe I've just killed someone.""'

'As we got close to the pavement I heard a loud noise and it was like a car was revving its engine, so I grabbed Coral and we ran on to the pavement. The car's exhaust made two really loud noises, it was increasing in volume.'

She was a talented artist, described in testimonials as gifted, but humble. People say that since the accident, she has become a changed person and retreated into her shell.' Judge Robert Altham told Foulser during sentencing: 'It seems plain to me that inexperience must have played some part in this accident. 'Clearly, your attention was focussed on them long after it should have been. It's clear to me that this is not a case where there is a momentary lapse of attention. 'There was at least an element of you rebuking these people by continuing to stare at them and that meant you didn't see Mrs Monks, who was in front of you, until it was far too late. You struck her and you killed her. 'It is clear you are a bright young woman, cherished by your family, but Averil Monks was also somebody cherished by her family. 'After her death, her husband in particular was devastated. He couldn't go home for many months and when he did, he couldn't bring himself to sleep upstairs.

A greedy landlord who looted £32,000 while running a posh pub had another double life - a business and a huge villa in Spain. Stephen Sussams, 59, stole £17,000 from his dead boyfriend’s bank account and conned nearly £15,000 in housing and council tax benefit. But at the same time he was driving a Bentley and running the Royal Dart Hotel in Kingswear, Devon - which sold 'The Most Expensive Burger In The World'. Benefit fraudster: Stephen Sussams looted £32,000 while running a gastropub in Devon and a bar in Spain . Sussams behind the bar of The Royal Dart in Kingswear, Devon, which sold what was claimed to be the world's most expensive burger . Sussams was jailed in December last year - despite claiming he was too fat for prison. But a TV crew who filmed Croydon Council’s pursuit of the conman discovered not only did he live a double life in the UK - he also had a secluded hill-top villa in southern Spain. The fraudster bought the stunning villa - since seized by a Spanish bank - and ran another bar business in the tourist spot while claiming incapacity benefits back in the UK. Andrea Cordery, an investigator at Croydon Council, said: 'This is not just a lone parent doing an extra cleaning job to feed her starving children, or his starving children, this has been quite deceitful to say the least.' Sussams looked after disabled civil partner Keith Dickinson but failed to tell the local authority when he died at the age of 72 in 2008.

The council continued paying care benefits into Mr Dickinson’s bank and Sussams carried on taking the money - withdrawing £4,000 the day after his death.

At the same time Sussams’ pub in Kingswear, Devon, was boasting an £125 burger made from champagne-marinated Japanese Wagyu beef and seasoned with fresh black truffle.

Council investigator Mrs Cordery, who worked for two-and-a-half years to catch the conman, added: 'The account was not closed and it kept on running, so the council kept on paying for care for a dead man. 'We needed to get that money back so we wrote to him in 2009 asking him to give us a refund of this money. He did not want responsibility for that. 'That led to us having to have a closer look at his affairs and then it just opened up a whole can of worms for him.' At his trial, his lawyer said Sussams should be spared jail because he was struggling with obesity-related illness, including diabetes, heart disease and hypertension. But a judge dismissed the plea and threw him behind bars for eight months, after a jury found him guilty of four counts of benefit fraud and one count of theft, in December last year.

"By . Associated Press . PUBLISHED: . 08:53 EST, 11 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:03 EST, 11 November 2013 . Jordan Belfort insists he's a changed man. The old Belfort was a notorious stock swindler who squandered profits from a boiler-room, 'pump and dump' scheme on cocaine, prostitutes and other excesses - a story that became basis for two memoirs and The Wolf of Wall Street an upcoming movie starring Leonardo Di Caprio. The new Belfort is a business consultant who claims he would never tell a lie and frets over recent suggestions that he may be avoiding payments on $110 million in restitution by hiding his profits from the book and movie deals. Notorious stock swindler Jordan Belfort insists that he's given up lying and despite a recent fuss over his finances, isn't hiding his money . Leonardo Di Caprio is appearing in a forthcoming film based on the scam, The Wolf of Wall Street . 'It's very strange being accused of something I wouldn't have done in a million years,"" the 51-year Belfort said. 'It's so not where my head is at.' In early October, prosecutors asked a federal judge in Brooklyn to find Belfort in default, saying he paid only $11.6 million of the $110 million he owes as restitution for a securities fraud and money laundering conviction. They have since withdrawn the request to see if a settlement can be worked out - but not before a wave of bad press portraying Belfort as a deadbeat. 'In some weird way, it probably helps the movie,' he said in a recent phone interview. 'It doesn't help me.' The film - directed by Martin Scorsese and set for release on Christmas Day - chronicles the boyish, fast-talking Belfort's antics as chairman of Stratton Oakmont Inc., the firm he started with a few desks and phones set up in a former Long Island auto shop. 'Leo's amazing, a brilliant actor,' Belfort said. 'I spent hundreds of hours with him. And Marty's brilliant too.' Stratton Oakmont made a fortune by using . deceptive, high-pressure tactics to peddle penny stocks at inflated . prices. After artificially pumping the value up, Belfort and others . would dump their own shares before prices crashed. Stephen Chow, of behavioural profiling firm Acuity Consulting, and Belfort set up a joint venture on the ethics of business . Belfort and his cronies ended up making more cash than they knew what to do with: A movie trailer shows a smirking DiCaprio crumpling up $100 bills and throwing them in a waste basket. He spent part of his ill-gotten gains on a 166-foot yacht - which sank - and a $175,000 sports car. Looking back, he says becoming rich by deceit wasn't worth it. 'Fraud is not something you want to be good at,' he said. 'I was always taking great efforts to cover my tracks. 'It was unbelievably exhausting, keeping track of all the lies. ... I think that's why I lived so recklessly. You're doing things that you know can't go on indefinitely. It fuels that insane lifestyle.' Belfort pleaded guilty in 1999 and . agreed to become a government witness in a case against an accountant . and other stock fraud defendants accused of cooking the firm's books and . funneling money into a bogus holding company and overseas bank . accounts. In 2003, after a . broken marriage and a bout with drug addiction, Belfort was sentenced to . three and a half years behind bars and ordered to chip away at the $110 . million restitution by giving 50 percent of his future earnings to the . government. Di Caprio (pictured) stars in the movie about Belfort's extravagant 'greed is good' lifestyle . Book sales resulted in payments of about $700,000 from 2007 to 2009, court papers say. But after completing probation in 2010, prosecutors claim Belfort's payments have slowed to a trickle - even after he made $940,500 off the sale of the 'Wolf' movie rights and continued to capitalize on his notoriety as a motivational speaker and business consultant. Under those circumstances, it's not surprising that the government went on the offensive, said Marcos Jimenez, a former federal prosecutor now in private practice in Miami. 'I think it's a little bit in-your-face when you write books and help make movies about your crimes, especially when the crimes are why you owe restitution,' Jimenez said. In the interview, Belfort said he now can make tens of thousands of dollars for speaking engagements and other services. His website boasts that he's developed a system to 'take virtually any company or individual ... and empower them to create massive wealth, abundance and entrepreneurial success, without sacrificing integrity or ethics,' and features testimonials of heads of telecommunications and real estate companies in Australia. 'Jordan is no longer a criminal,' his fiancée, Anne Koppe, wrote in a recent letter to the judge. '""He is an exemplary contributor to the economy. He is a taxpayer and a very hard-working man.' As to his current problems with the law, Belfort's lawyers have argued that his obligation to pay half his earnings ended when he went off probation. Still, he claims he's repeatedly offered to pay 100 per cent of his book and movie profits and to negotiate a settlement on restitution, only to be met with silence. 'There's so much distrust,' Belfort said of the prosecutors. 'Most people lie to them. I don't want to make any money from the books or the movie. I don't think they could fathom that.' Someone like Belfort bemoaning a lack of trust is outrageous, said Dianne Nygaard, a Kansas City, Mo., lawyer who once represented some of his victims. She recalled that one of her clients, after being duped by a cold call from Stratton Oakmont, sold the family farm so he could invest. 'No one should consider him trustworthy,' Nygaard said of Belfort. 'He is the consummate con man, winning the confidence of the naive, the trusting and the greedy by calculatedly selling people what they wanted to believe.' In a letter dated October 25, prosecutors told the judge they're reviewing documents turned over by Belfort before the case returns to court later this month. He's hoping for a quick resolution so he can move on. 'I just want to finally close out that chapter of my life,' he said.","Jordan Belfort made a fortune by using .

A landscape gardener who built a wall on his own land has now been told it's an 'obstruction' by the local council which is making him pay £3,500 to have it torn down. Garry Painter built the metre-high brick wall around his garden after buying a converted barn in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire. However, council officials claim that even though the 54-year-old owns the land it's built on, it must come down as it is obstructing the public highway and he had a 'duty' not to build on it. Anger: Garry Painter has been ordered to tear down the garden wall he built at his home in Worcestershire . Mr Painter moved in to the home with his . partner and their two daughters in 2007, and says he spent four months . and £4,000 tidying up the adjacent plot of land by re-turfing the ground . and erecting the garden wall. Two years later, Worcestershire County . Council ordered him to return the land to its original state by . demolishing the wall and ripping up the turf. Although he is the legal . owner of the land, the council claims that part of it has traditionally . been a public highway, meaning he has a duty not to build on it in order . to allow unimpeded access for motorists and pedestrians. The wall is situated on a verge, with a gap of around 1ft between the wall and the road. Legal battle: Mr Painter has spent four years trying to prove to the council that he has the right to build . 'Obstruction': The council claims the wall is built on a public highway and is therefore illegal . Following a four-year legal battle, . the council has now given Mr Painter a month to tear down the wall or . face a £3,500 bill for them to hire a contractor to do it. 'All . my neighbours think my wall and lawn look great and it really improves . the look of the area,' Mr Painter said. 'I can't see how the council can . possibly think that ripping up my lawn and tearing down the wall is a . good idea. 'The wall's . been there for more than six years now. I just can't see what the . problem is. I feel as though it's David versus Goliath, and I won't give . in to these bullies.' When Mr Painter's solicitor wrote to the council pointing out that he owned the land, they replied: 'The ownership is worthless to your client as it relates to the subsoil ownership only and does not supercede any highways rights that exist over the surface.' But the gardener said: 'I have taken a piece of land which I own and significantly improved it. If I didn't own it and had just tidied it up, it would still be ridiculous but I could understand. 'But they want me to knock down my wall and rip up all of the turf on my own land. And the council have the cheek to bill me for the demolition, which they say is £3,500 plus a tipping charge.' Letter: The council told Mr Painter's lawyer that his ownership of the land is 'worthless' Deadline: The wall is due to be demolished later this month and Mr Painter will have to pay . He is now seeking an injunction to stop the council knocking down the wall, and says the case has already cost him £5,000. 'I am not going to back down and I am prepared to take this to court,' Mr Painter said. 'I know 100 per cent I will win my case as the wall is on my land and I have the papers to prove it. 'There are so many abandoned and shabby properties which need demolishing which the council aren't interested in, but I try to make my small patch of land look neat and tidy and suddenly they want to knock it down. It is ridiculous. 'It may seem petty to some people but this wall means the earth to me. I had it built to improve my land and I am fully within my rights as the landowner to do so.' A spokesman for Worcestershire County Council refused to comment, saying: 'This is currently a matter which is the subject for discussion between respective solicitors.'","Garry Painter, 54, built metre-high wall around his garden in Worcestershire .

With the latest film of the Hunger Games trilogy, Catching Fire, hitting our screens this month, just as the Christmas party season kicks off in earnest, we're thinking that tribute-style hair and make-up, as overseen by the glamorous Effie Trinket, is just the inspiration we've been looking for. But, if you don't have your very own Cinna on hand, don't panic. This week, we caught up with top make-up artist Emma White Turle who has worked with A-listers from Jerry Hall and Kelly Brook to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Justin Timberlake, and will be prepping the Hunger Games stars for the red carpet at next week's Catching Fire premiere. While you might think that the Capitol looks are a little too extreme for real life, Emma explains that they can be made much more wearable. Scroll down for video . Take inspiration for your festive season make-up from Hunger Games' star Effie Trinket . 'Worn all together, they could look a little OTT,' she admits. 'But I definitely think that these futuristic trends are starting to make their way into the mainstream. More and more people are wearing strong colours and feeling free to experiment more, and beauty brands are allowing them to experiment with innovative textures and shades.' Here's Emma's step-by-step guide to getting a Hunger Games-inspired party look. 1) Flawless skin . 'Jennifer Lawrence has amazing skin – and in fact everyone in the Capitol has this really ethereal luminosity to their complexion. In real life, that means cleansing properly. I use Sisley's Eau Efficace (£71, . johnlewis.com), which is expensive but it's brilliant and lasts forever. Once skin’s clean, start with Smashbox's Photo Finish Luminising Primer . (£25, boots.com) It’s a very sheer pale pearlescent primer with gold . flecks that suits all skintones and I use that as the base for a really . luminous look. I . particularly concentrate on the tops of the cheeks, the brow, the centre . of the nose, the Cupid's bow of the lips and the chin. Flawless complexion: Actor Stanley Tucci (Caesar Flickerman) parades Jennifer Lawrence (Katniss Everdeen) for the second instalement of the The Hunger Games: Catching Fire . 2) Conceal and mattify . Once you've created that luminous base, you need to conceal as required. I use Bobbi Brown correctors and concealers (£18.50, bobbibrown.co.uk) wherever they're needed. A little bit under the eyes, a touch around the nose, and on any blemishes. Then, tap on a little bit of translucent powder. The Smashbox Photo Set Finishing Powder (£18, boots.com) regulates oil and moisturises the skin so it does a great job of taking away the ugly shine, while keeping the dewy glow that you want. Cinna aka Lenny Kravitz shows off his sparkling side in The Hunger Games by adorning gold eye liner . 3) Liquid gold liner . In the film Cinna wears a really stunning gold eyeliner and I think that's a really fabulous look for parties. I use Make Up For Ever Diamond Powder in Gold (£19.50, gurumakeupemporium.com) - just add a tiny bit of water and you've got a liquid liner. I use it with the Smashbox Arced Eyeliner Brush (£16, boots.com) to get it just where I want it. Liquid liner like this last longer than pens or pencils and is more precise. If you've never used liquid liner before, I recommend putting a mirror on the table and looking down into it with your elbow resting on the table - it's easier than trying to close one eye. Finish with a bit of mascara - I like Bobbi Brown's Extreme Party Mascara (£19, bobbibrown.co.uk) because the brush is brilliant - and remember to take it right from the base of the lashes. Contouring looks: Katniss played by Jennifer Lawrence shows off her chameleon style . Elizabeth Banks (Effie Trinket) showcases a range of bright lipsticks and colourful make-up . 4) Contouring . This is a real make-up artist's trick. Use a fan brush or an angled soft dome brush and just remember that whatever you make darker recedes, and whatever you make lighter comes forward. A little goes a long way so use a light hand and matte brown shade - I use one from the Make Up For Ever Sculpting Kit in Neutral (£27.95, gurumakeupemporium.com) - just under the cheeks and then a lighter one. To get that almost ghostly effect, rather than using a flat light shade, I like Mac's Iridescent Powder in Silver Dusk (£20, maccosmetics.co.uk) - a touch under the eyebrow, down the centre of the nose and on the Cupid's bow of the lips. Blend well - you don't want any 1980s, Dynasty-style stripes. MailOnline's Julia Guest was given a Hunger Games makeover by Emma White Turle . Before and after: Julia is given a Capitol-inspired party look featuring gold eyeliner as seen on stylist Cinna and a glittering red lip as worn by Effie Trinket . 5) Red lips . For modern red lips, you don't have to worry about liner, just keep it soft and pretty. I'm using Yves Saint Laurent Le Rouge Pur Couture in N°41, Rouge Madras (£25, johnlewis.com), but if you're scared of red, the one shade I've found that really suits everyone is Smashbox Infrared Matte (£15, boots.com). I use a brush - Chanel's lip brush is the best I've found as it's curved at the end so sweeps into the lip shape and helps to keep the edges soft and wearable.' 'To up the glamour for a party, I love a bit of glitter. I used a brush to apply red glitter - I use a Mac one that I picked up in the US but you can use any brand - on top of the red lipstick. It lasts longer than you might expect - although it's probably worth drinking through a straw.' 'Oh, and a top tip for getting rid of stray glitter: use a clean mascara wand, it takes it straight off.'","Make-up artists are taking inspiration from the film's futuristic styling .

The headmistress of a Christian private school punished a nine-year-old girl by rapping her on the knuckles with a ruler before drawing blood by hitting her on the head, a court heard. Rally Ikiebe, 50, allegedly regularly hit pupils at the £8,000-a-year Chrysolyte Independent School in Southwark, South London. On this occasion, the headteacher beat the girl after she heard talking coming from one of the classrooms. She blamed the schoolgirl, who cannot be named for legal reasons, and hit her between five and ten times on the knuckles with a ruler 'so it would hurt more', it is claimed. The girl, who fell off chair and lay crying on the floor as she was hit, was also struck twice across her head, Inner London Crown Court heard. She was hit with such force that her hands were bruised and her head started bleeding on the bus home from school, it is claimed. In a police interview, played on TV screens to the jury, the girl revealed that teachers at the school would often use rulers for beating. She said her teacher, known as ‘Matron’, told her to 'put her hands out' and then told her to turn them 'that way, knuckles up'. The pupil said: 'She got a flexible ruler and she hit me on the knuckles hard. 'I was crying so hard. I was on my knees in front of my friends - it was really embarrassing. Then she started to hit me over the head. 'Then she said: ""It’s time to go to the school bus - pick up your things and go."" 'Sitting on the bus something hurt, I scratched it again. Matron hit me so hard that I started bleeding on my head' The child’s mother took photos of her daughter’s injuries and phoned Ikiebe and her husband, Reverend Joseph Ikiebe, a co-founder of the school, to complain. The couple went around to her home with a bottle of TCP at around midnight on the night of the incident, on January 17 last year, the court heard. They begged her mother not to make a police complaint and to forgive Ikiebe because they were both Christians. Ikiebe, back right with cream top, is alleged to have regularly hit pupils at the £8,000-a-year Southwark school . The schoolgirl said: 'She said that because we all come from Christian families we all have to forgive each other.' It was not until six months later that she called police, who arrested the teacher. But the schoolgirl revealed that ‘Matron’ had given out brutal beatings to pupils on other occasions, giving them extra strokes if they screamed. The schoolgirl said on one occasion a new pupil was left quaking in fear. She said: 'Everybody would get hit. The new boy was scared. He said: ""Why am I getting tortured?""' She told the court the teacher said: '""Whoever screams will get extra strokes."" She would give us three and if you scream you get five.' Ikiebe confessed to hitting the girl on the knuckles, but insists she only did it to disarm the pupil. She claims the child was holding a pointed compass and she feared the schoolgirl was going to stab other kids. But Giles Curtis-Raleigh, prosecuting, said: 'She decided to punish her. She asked to take a ruler from one of the other children and told the alleged victim to hold her hands out knuckles up so it would hurt more, and she hit her over her hand a number of times.' Handing out photos to the jury showing the injuries the youngster received, he added: 'You can see what appears to be caked blood from a cut. 'And you can see several linear injuries on the hands.' The teacher denied hitting the girl on the head at the Inner London Crown Court trial . The teacher, from Plumstead in south-east London, denied hitting the girl on the head and insists she got her injuries when she hit a radiator after falling off her chair. Accompanied by her husband and other family members, she appeared in court dressed in black trousers and a knitted light brown jumper. She denies one charge of causing actual bodily harm.

Police officers accused of stitching up former Cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell in the plebgate row yesterday refused to offer him an unreserved apology. The two Police Federation officers had been dragged to the House of Commons to appear for the second time in front of the home affairs select committee. But committee chairman Keith Vaz said he was disappointed that Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton and Sergeant Chris Jones were not ‘unequivocal’ in saying sorry to Mr Mitchell. Recall: Sergeant Chris Jones was accused of lying about his disciplinary record Detective Sergeant Stuart Hinton was called to Parliament to apologise for denying calling Home Secretary Theresa May 'that woman' The officers were warned that they could face proceedings for contempt of Parliament if they did not correct evidence given during their previous appearance last month, which MPs claimed had been shown to be false. The two officers, along with Inspector Ken MacKaill, have been accused of attempting to discredit Mr Mitchell after meeting him in October last year. They claimed the MP had failed to give a proper account of the ‘plebgate’ incident, but a secret recording made by Mr Mitchell showed he had offered an explanation. Warning: Committee chairman Keith Vaz warned the officers that they risked being in contempt of Parliament if they failed to give straight answers . The recording also revealed that Det Sgt Stuart Hinton, of Warwickshire police, had referred to Home Secretary Theresa May disparagingly as ‘that woman’. Mr Hinton apologised for originally telling the committee that he had made no such reference, saying it was an ‘inadvertent error’ and that he had not remembered using the phrase. But the officers refused to show contrition over statements they made following their meeting with Mr Mitchell, which contributed to his forced resignation. Forced to quit: Andrew Mitchell arriving at Downing Street on his bike . No apology: Chris Jones, Ken MacKaill and Stuart Hinton repeatedly refused to apologise to Andrew Mitchell despite admitting misleading the public about a meeting with him . Sgt Chris Jones, of West Midlands Police, was also challenged by MPs over his previous evidence that he had never been subject to disciplinary proceedings. Yesterday, he confirmed that 13 complaints had been made about him, claiming that he had previously misunderstood the committee’s questions. After the hearing, Mr Vaz said: ‘I’m disappointed they did not take the opportunity to we gave them to be unequivocal in their apology to Mr Mitchell and his family.’ A previous inquiry by the three forces resulted in no action. But Dame Anne Owers, the chairwoman of the Independent Police Complaints Commission, announced that two new inquiries have been launched into Mr Jones and Mr Hinton.

Labour’s new women’s spokesman Gloria de Piero yesterday defended doing a topless photoshoot when she was a schoolgirl, saying she understood why girls make the decision to strip off. The glamorous 40-year-old former GMTV political editor was 15 when she posed for the pictures to earn money to buy herself some new clothes. Newly promoted to Ed Miliband’s Shadow Cabinet, she revealed yesterday that she thought topless Page 3 girls were ‘totally out of date’. But she added: ‘I’ve always said I don’t blame the girls. I understand how they might think it would be a way out.’ Ms de Piero said that when the truth about her photos emerged, Harriet Harman – who was the women and equalities minister at the time – provided her with ‘amazing’ support. She told her: ‘Don’t worry, it’s absolutely fine Gloria, we wouldn’t judge you for that,’ and urged her not to ‘change’ or get ‘buttoned up’. Born in Bradford, to Italian immigrants, Miss de Piero – who once came ahead of Kate Moss in FHM magazine’s list of the Sexiest Women In The World – has rarely spoken about her risque photoshoot. After her secret was uncovered in 2010, the then-parliamentary candidate explained how she had been motivated by a lack of spending money after her father was forced to give up his job due to ill health. ‘It was simply that I needed some money to buy clothes,’ she said. ‘When you are 15 or 16 and you want to fit in and wear nice things, but you don’t have any and put on your school uniform even when you are allowed to be in your own clothes, nothing matters more.’ And she said that when her parents found out, they ‘went a lot less mental than I thought they would’. Explaining how the memory still helped motivate her to campaign against sexism, she said: ‘I can understand why a girl might feel she has no option but to do something like that.’ The former breakfast television presenter, who married her long-term partner last year, also revealed yesterday that at the age of about 37 she decided to concentrate on her political career rather than starting a family. She said: ‘I’m 40 now and I’ve always said I don’t want kids, but that decision will be removed from me incredibly soon.'

A married undercover cop in Arizona began an affair with the drug dealer she was investigating only to out herself and two other colleagues while the pair lay in bed according to a police report. Tempe Police Detective Jessica Dever-Jakusz, 38, met her drug-dealer lover in June of 2013 after buying narcotics from him undercover and by August she was having regular sex with him at his home. But on October 10th, after one of their trysts, Dever-Jakusz - who is married to a police officer - revealed that she was working undercover to arrest him at the same time as betraying her colleagues' identities. Scroll Down for Video . Undercover: The Maricopa County Attorney's Office is reviewing a Tempe police report that alleges Jessica Dever-Jakusz engaged in an affair with a suspected drug-dealer while undercover . An anonymous tip to police led to the unidentified suspect being brought in for questioning on October 15th where he admitted to a sexual relationship with the 13-year force veteran and revealed explicit text messages he exchanged with Dever-Jakusz - including one in which she was asking to come to his house that day. The affair ruined a five-month-long undercover investigation into the sale of MDMA in Tempe, which is nicknamed Molly. The police report was released after a public information request and was heavily redacted. Included in the report was the statement made by Dever-Jakusz's lover who said that he was stunned when she told him she was a police officer actively trying to send him to prison. Jessica Dever-Jakusz is accused of starting up a romantic relationship with a drug dealer while she was undercover -- putting two other officers at risk in the process . 'Up until that time, the suspect did not know or ever suspected that Dever-Jakusz was a police officer, the report said . According to the suspect she was supposed to be investigating, Dever-Jakusz initially lied she was married and then when she revealed all, told him that her husband was a Chandler police officer, but that they had been having marital issues. During her confession, she told the drug dealer suspect that her husband had been 'looking up a bunch of stuff on him,' according to USA Today. And that she suspected his motivation for doing this was 'for other than a legitimate purpose as a law-enforcement officer.' Chandler Police confirmed last week that the husband, Officer Garrett Dever is now the subject of an internal-affairs investigation and is married to Jessica Dever-Jakusz, but did not elaborate. It is not known if Dever-Jakusz's husband was aware or suspected the affair before she made her startling confession. However, police sources told Arizona network KPHO that the investigation involved Dever using police computers to look up a subject he believed his wife was having an affair with and then threatening that man. The police report said Dever-Jakusz's revelations to the drug suspect on Oct. 10 severely damaged a five-month undercover investigation by at least three detectives into the sale of the drug called ""Molly"" Police sent a report last week to the Maricopa County Attorney's Office recommending that she be charged with two counts of hindering prosecution. A spokesman said last week that the case is under review. A Tempe police spokesman declined Tuesday to provide contact information for Dever-Jacusz and a spokesman for the County Attorney's Office couldn't immediately say whether Dever-Jakusz has a lawyer. Tempe Police Chief Tom Ryff sent a memo last week to employees confirming Dever-Jakusz's resignation. His memo revealed that the case had been referred for possible prosecution but didn't elaborate. The Tempe report says no drug charges can be filed against the suspect with whom Dever-Jakusz had the relationship and it's unknown if any charges could move forward against other suspects from the undercover operation.","Tempe, Arizona police officer Jessica Dever-Jakusz is accused of endangering the lives of two undercover colleagues by revealing their identities to a drug-dealer she was sleeping with .

A 44-year-old man has denied murdering a policeman who was hacked to death during riots in Tottenham more than 28 years ago. Nicholas Jacobs, who was just 16 at the time of the riots, was allegedly part of a mob who killed 40-year-old PC Keith Blakelock during violence on the Broadwater Farm estate in north London in October 1985. But he told the Old Bailey today: 'I'm innocent.' Victim: PC Keith Blakelock was murdered during violent clashes in Tottenham, north London, in October 1985 . In the dock: A court drawing of Nicholas Jacobs from an earlier hearing at the Old Bailey . Father-of-three PC Blakelock was protecting firefighters while they tackled a blaze at a supermarket during the rioting. But he is believed to have been set upon by a group of people shouting 'kill the pig' after he became separated from his colleagues. PC Blakelock was stabbed 42 times and it is believed that his attackers tried to decapitate him, with the intention of displaying his head on a pole to send a grotesque message to his fellow officers. He was eventually dragged away by colleagues but died later the same night at North Middlesex Hospital. Jacobs was charged in July after he was arrested with 13 other men in 2010. Denial: Nicholas Jacobs was pictured with a sign denying the murder of the police officer in 1985 . All 13 of the other men arrested have since been released without charge. Bearded and wearing a striped white and . blue shirt and jeans, Jacobs spoke in a loud voice to deny a single . count of murder on October 6, 1985. He was remanded in custody and will stand trial in March next year. Jacobs, from Hackney in East London, was pictured earlier this year holding a sign protesting his innocence. The sign read: 'I did not murder PC Blakelock. 'I was not there when PC Blakelock was murdered. I don't know who murdered PC Blakelock. I'm innocent.' Violence: Police on the Broadwater Farm estate in north London, during the riots in which PC Keith Blakelock was hacked to death . Aftermath: Police officers inspect the damage walking past burnt out houses and cars in Tottenham following a night of rioting in 1985 . Three men - Winston Silcott, Mark Braithwaite and Engin Raghip - were convicted of PC Blakelock's murder in 1987. But their convictions were overturned four-and-a-half years later. Forensics tests on pages of key interview records suggested that they may have been fabricated. The murder investigation was reopened in 2010 when a case review found that there were new leads. PC Blakelock, originally from Sunderland, had been sent to the Broadwater Farm estate with his colleague PC Richard Coombes. Tributes: Police officers inspect floral tributes left for PC Blakelock close to where he was killed . PC Coombes was also seriously injured in the incident and never served as a police officer again. Trouble had broken out in north London following the death of 49-year-old West Indian woman Cynthia Jarrett. She died from heart failure when police raided her home. Officers had stopped her son Floyd, then 24, to inspect his car's tax disc. He was later charged with theft and assault at a Tottenham police station, but both charges were later dropped. The incident sparked accusations that the Met Police was institutionally racist.

Jailed: Gary Jones, 49, went to his sister's holiday home and trashed it because his family did not send him a birthday card . A resentful son who trashed his sister's holiday home in revenge for not being sent a birthday card by his family has been jailed. Gary Jones, 49, was so angry that both his mother and sister forgot his birthday he sent them a stream of threatening messages before trashing the property in Torquay, Devon. He smashed the windows of the seaside holiday home, scrawled his name on the walls and left the taps and gas cooker on in the hope of running up huge utility bills. Jones has a long-standing grudge against his mother who he accuses of showing favouritism towards his sister Gail, Exeter Crown Court heard. The former trucker, from Torquay, admitted burglary and criminal damage at the house in August and was jailed for two years today by Judge Phillip Wassall. The judge told him: 'This offence was motivated by resentment after an expected birthday card failed to arrive. You say it was a cry for help but my reading is that this is a rather twisted view. 'This is a very sad case but resentment plainly lay behind what happened. You gained entry to your sister’s house by smashing a window and turned on the taps and the gas cooker, all with the aim of costing her as much as you could. 'You wrote your name in pencil on the walls. Your mother and sister say they are fearful of you. 'Your mother has stood by you throughout everything but says she feels uncomfortable in her home because she believes one day you will go there and do something very serious. 'The vitriol and force of language in the messages you left on her phone is quite shocking. 'You caused extensive damage to the property because of a perceived grievance that went back years.' Miss Emily Pitts, prosecuting, said Jones rang his mother’s answerphone three times before going to his sister Gail’s house and demanded £5,000. Holiday home: Gary Jones went round to his sister's holiday home in this road in Torquay, Devon, broke in and scrawled obscenities on the wall, Torquay Crown Court was told . He threatened to smash all the windows and said he did not care if he was arrested because he intended to denounce his mother and sister to police as benefit fiddlers. In his calls, Jones accused his mother of ignoring his birthday and giving everything she wanted to his sister and nothing to him. Police were called by neighbours to the holiday home in Torquay after they heard a window being smashed and they found Jones outside with food and alcohol he had taken from the property. The messages on the walls included his name, obscenities, and a smiley face. Miss Pitts said: 'His mother and sister are petrified of him.' Mr Lee Bremridge, defending, said Jones has long standing problems arising from a head injury which he suffered when he fell out of a tree as a child. He said this caused memory loss which forced him to give up his career as a lorry driver because he could not remember where he was going. He said Jones had been doing well with treatment from a clinic in Torbay but his support had been reduced earlier this year and he started abusing alcohol. He had long standing family problems caused by his belief that he had been less favoured than his sister over many decades.","Gary Jones broke into the property in Torquay, Devon, while it was empty .

A roundabout in a quaint country village has been crowned the best in Britain after it was identified as the only one in the country to boast its own duck pond. The idyllic traffic island in the village of Otford, near Sevenoaks, Kent is also only circular junction in the UK to have been granted listed status. It was spotted by roundabout fan Kevin Beresford, who travels the country to judge entrants in the competition. Quirk: The Otford roundabout in Kent, pictured, is the only one of its kind which has listed status in the UK . Winner: The picturesque Otford junction, above, scooped the 'Roundabout of the Year' prize thanks to its unusual duck pond . Kevin, who is president of the Roundabout Appreciation Society admitted he travels the length and breadth of the UK seeking out the best circular roads that Britain has to offer. He described the winning roundabout as 'bizarre' but declared his love for the five-exit junction because of its classic green appearance. He said: 'I love this roundabout because it is so quintessentially English. 'I have travelled from Land’s End to John O’Groats looking at roundabouts and thought I had seen them all, but I’ve never seen one with a duck pond before. 'Normally I describe a roundabout as an oasis on a sea of asphalt but this has turned that statement inside. 'We’ve got an island made up of water surrounded by land, which is bizarre.' Community: Locals work on the Otford roundabout, pictured in 1952, ahead of the festival of Britain eight years later . Water feature: Residents enjoy the newly installed duck house which was built in 1960 . The pretty pond, which is circled by willow trees, is thought to date back to Anglo Saxon times, when it was possibly used as a drinking hole for local livestock. In 1951 it was repaired by villagers for the Festival of Britain and in 1960 a duck house was placed on the pond, which is fed from a spring by the village station. The pond was granted grade two listed status in January 1975 after plans to concrete it over were met with protest from villagers. The Holgate Windmill in York, pictured, dates back to 1770 and is a past winner of the prestigious roundabout award . In 2008 the pond, which forms a natural roundabout in the centre of the village, was repaired and strengthened after the toll of years of heavy traffic going around it. Parish council chairman John Edwards-Winser said he was 'thrilled' the village roundabout had won the award. 'Otford is a beautiful place to live and the duck pond is the jewel in our crown. It’s a talking point and everyone who visits the village stops to look at the pond roundabout as it’s totally unique.' 'It doesn’t matter which way you drive into the village, you’re greeted with outstanding views. Modern: The BFI IMAX roundabout in London, pictured, is one of the newer additions to the roundabout hall of fame . Exotic: The Pagoda roundabout, above, may have a Far Eastern name, but it's actually in Birmingham . Runner-up: This junction at Chepstow racecourse came in for a notable mention but pipped at the post in the best roundabout stakes . 'A lot of work goes into keeping the duck pond and it even has its own pond keeper. 'The pond is a real source of pride for the village. Sometimes you take these things for granted but every once in a while something like this happens to remind you how lucky you are to live here.' Previous roundabouts to be awarded the society’s accolade are the BFI Imax roundabout in London, the Shepherd and Flock roundabout in Farnham and the Holgate Windmill roundabout in York. The award means the roundabout will now feature on the front cover of the Roundabout Preservation Society’s 2014 calendar.

Facebook said the UK is leading the big move to mobile in Europe as it released numbers confirming the number of Britons using its network for the first time. The social network said more than a third of the population use its website every day, with 33 million people logging on every month. A total of 83 per cent of daily users access the social network on their tablet or smartphone. James Quarles, regional director for Europe, the Middle East and Africa at Facebook, told Josh Halliday at The Guardian that the UK is among the countries taking the lead out of its 1.1 billion global users, in making a massive shift to mobile.

Around 26 million Britons use their smartphone or tablet to log onto Facebook each month, with some 20 million people doing so daily. It is the first time Facebook has . revealed how many people use its website on a daily basis in the UK, . perhaps in a bid to quash rumours that its popularity has peaked. Facebook said figures show the social network has a daily reach which exceeds many platforms monthly user figures - such as Twitter, which has 10 million registered users in the UK - as well as to help the industry better understand media consumption. A total of 83 percent of daily users access the social network on their tablet or smartphone and the UK is among the countries taking the lead out of its 1.1 billion global users in making a massive shift to mobile, according to Facebook .

Facebook has reportedly claimed reports of falling visitor numbers are unrepresentative and Quarles said mobile usage in the UK has actually increased by 20 percent.

Mohammed Ahmed Mohamed may have been in possession of his passport when he gave authorities the slip by cutting off his ankle tag with a sharp instrument. The details of how easily he got away heaped fresh pressure on the Home Office and police yesterday. Theresa May was forced to admit inadvertently misleading Parliament when she said on Monday police had seized the fanatic’s travel document. In fact, officers were never able to find one. The Home Office said Mohamed’s passport had been cancelled – but refused to say if this happened before or after he fled. Sources revealed how the terror suspect removed the ankle tag, fitted as a condition of his terrorism prevention order (T-Pim), after entering the An-Noor mosque in West London last Friday. He had arrived at 10am and left at 3.15pm. The tag sent a ‘tamper-alert’ to its maker, private security firm G4S, which then rang Mohamed to check where he was. It was only when he did not respond to the call that police and the Home Office were alerted. But by the time officers arrived he had disappeared. Wanted: CCTV images issued by the Met Police of Mohamed who is wanted by Scotland Yard terror officers . Security officials launched a major manhunt for the jihadist, but fear he may already have fled to Somalia. On Monday, Mrs May told MPs  that police had Mohamed’s British passport. But yesterday she said Mohamed was not in possession of his British passport when he returned to the UK after being arrested overseas, so ‘there was no passport for the police to seize’. Keith Vaz, chairman of the Commons  Home Affairs Committee, said: ‘When there are only eight people on T-Pims they [the Home Office] ought to know every detail about them.’ A Whitehall official dismissed suggestions Mohamed had fled using the travel document, saying: ‘As far as we know he didn’t have a passport.’ Admission: Theresa May was forced to admit inadvertently misleading Parliament when she said on Monday police had seized the fanatic¿s travel document.

Hospital food is to be given an overhaul following concerns that a third of vulnerable patients are not being given enough help at meal times. Many are too frail even to open cling-film or cardboard packaging and are left struggling as nursing staff move on to the next bed. Without the necessary assistance, they risk malnutrition and dehydration, say charities. Ministers are also concerned at the high cost of waste as 30million uneaten meals are thrown away annually. Worries: The Government and Age UK have now vowed to carry out a major review of hospital food, with national standards issued by next summer (file picture) It is feared many dishes consist of recipes that elderly patients would not normally eat, like Thai curry. The Government and Age UK have now vowed to carry out a major review of hospital food, with national standards issued by next summer. Relatives have told how previously sprightly patients have become emaciated and lifeless on wards because they are either too frail to eat or just cannot face the meals. Those with dementia, arthritis or poor sight are often left grappling with tricky wrapping and difficult to open sandwich packets or simply struggling to hold paper cups. Dianne Jeffrey, chairman of Age UK said: ‘There are a lot of older and vulnerable people who are malnourished or at risk of malnourishment. ‘To find yourself in hospital without control over what and when you eat and drink can be very distressing. 'Good nutrition and hydration are critical elements of hospital care and should be considered as important as medical treatment. 'Malnutrition and dehydration can be a real risk for patients if they go unnoticed and untreated. They can’t just be left as no one’s responsibility. Often the food doesn’t actually get into people’s stomach.’ Concern: Relatives have told how previously sprightly patients have become emaciated and lifeless on wards because they are either too frail to eat or just cannot face the meals (file picture) The charity and the Government is hoping to recruit a panel of experts, including nurses, carers and those working in the food industry, to draw up national guidelines. Protocols will include ways of ensuring there are enough staff to help the frailest patients with meals, as well as basic standards for food quality. A report by the Care Quality Commission this summer found that 36 per cent of vulnerable patients were not given vital help with meals. And a separate review of hospital food by the charity Sustain found that 30 million meals are thrown away every year. There were also concerns that offerings are too modern for the elderly, containing items like mung beans or Oriental flavours. Health Minister Dr Dan Poulter said: ‘There is still too much variation in food provision across the NHS and we want to see all hospitals following the same good practice standards that many are already achieving. 'In future, hospitals will be judged on the quality of their food by patients through patient-led assessments.’","They risk malnutrition and dehydration without assistance, charities say .

At a news conference at Durham Police’s Aykley Heads headquarters, Chief Inspector Ed Turner offered his condolences to Danny’s family, adding: 'I cannot imagine what they have been going through since the tragic events earlier this week. 'On Monday morning three-year-old Danny, along with his mum, brother Georgie and another child had been making their way from Darlington town centre where they had been to collect an Argos catalogue so that Danny could take it home and choose his Christmas presents.'

'Narcissist': Serial killer Dennis Nilsen is serving life for murdering six people including Billy Sutherland . The brother of one of the victims of Britain’s notorious serial killer Dennis Nilsen last night called for action to stop the murderer’s memoirs being published on the internet. The Mail on Sunday revealed last week how excerpts written by Nilsen, a former civil servant and police officer who is serving life for butchering six young men and trying to kill two others in the late 1970s and early 80s, had begun appearing on the web in defiance of a government ban. Now Seaton Sutherland, whose oldest brother Billy died at the hands of Nilsen, has broken 30 years of silence to express the family’s shock at the ease with which sections of the self-serving and ‘pornographic’ autobiography have been posted on two internet sites. The shock move comes despite the authorities, including former Home Secretary David Blunkett and the European Court of Human Rights, repeatedly banning publication, claiming the lurid details of the killings would be distressing to the victims’ families. Last night, Mr Sutherland, 47, from Edinburgh, said: ‘This man is a monster and he should not be allowed a voice. This is attempting to glorify what he did, and it was the right decision to stop his autobiography ever being published. ‘It is disgraceful that reputable sites are being used to get round the ban and someone should do something to pull the plug on this before it goes any further. Gag the monster before it’s too late and before more damage is done.’ Chapters posted over the past 10 days include material about Nilsen’s early life and his dead grandfather - which is used to justify his later crimes. Postings suggest further material is due to be placed online over coming weeks. It is known that copies of the autobiography were taken out of prison, but it is not clear who is responsible for putting the material on the internet - or whether they are acting on the instructions of the killer. Nilsen is denied access to the internet at Full Sutton maximum security prison near York. Locked up: Nilsen is denied access to the internet at Full Sutton maximum security prison near York . Mr Sutherland added: ‘What has appeared so far is disgusting. Why is action not being taken to stop this now? ‘Take it down for the sake of the families who are still having to deal with what he did. It wasn’t just our loved ones he killed. Something died inside my parents and my brothers and sisters. He ruined our family. We’ve never had anywhere to go to grieve for Billy because of what Nilsen did to him and the horror of how he died and what happened to him afterwards never leaves us.’ In 1996 Nilsen wrote his life story, Nilsen: History Of A Drowning Man. A copy was taken out of jail by his then solicitor, but publication was vetoed and the manuscript was not returned. Tragic: William Sutherland vanished aged 26 when he left Edinburgh to find work in London . Nilsen went to the European Court of Human Rights two years ago claiming his writings ‘stimulated much academic and medical debate’ but the case was dismissed. Nilsen, 67, who grew up in Fraserburgh, . Aberdeenshire, worked as an Army cook for 11 years before joining the . Metropolitan Police for eight months and later the civil service. Between 1978 and 1983, he killed at least 15 men and boys but claimed he . could not remember the names of nine. All his victims were students or mostly homeless men whom he took to his house either for sex or just for company. Once there, they were strangled or drowned. Eventually, he would dismember them and hide the remains, storing these under floorboards or in bin bags stuffed into a wardrobe. Unsuspecting Billy Sutherland, 26, a divorcee with a girlfriend and three-year-old son, left his home in Muirhouse, Edinburgh, for London in August 1980 to find a job but mysteriously ‘vanished’ within days of arriving in the capital. He had worked as a chef in London previously and hoped to find something similar when he visited the job centre where Nilsen worked. Hearing his Scottish accent, the killer suggested they to go for a drink. Billy would become Nilsen’s fourth victim that night but it was another three years before his family discovered he was dead. They reported his disappearance in 1980 to police in London and he remained a ‘missing person’ until Nilsen’s killing spree was uncovered in 1983. What has appeared so far is disgusting. Why is action not being taken to stop this now? - Seaton Sutherland, brother to Billy . Mr Sutherland said: ‘My mum was watching the news on TV. They were digging up Nilsen’s garden, looking for bodies. There was a knock at the door and it was detectives to say they had found parts of Billy under Nilsen’s floorboards. There was a piece of skin with a tattoo on it and his false teeth, which forensics used to confirm his identity. The whole family were in shock.’ In 1983, Nilsen was found guilty of six murders – including Billy’s - and two attempted murders. The Home Office has said Nilsen will never be released. Mr Sutherland added: ‘A memorial service was held for Billy but my dad, a proud marine engineer, couldn’t face going back to his job and my mum developed depression. Her only hope was when she died she would see Billy again. She also hoped to see Nilsen die in prison but that never happened. My parents are dead now and I can never forgive Nilsen for the misery he put them both through.’ It was not just the circumstances of Billy’s death, however, which tortured his family but the casual – and, they believe, untrue – comment to police by Nilsen after his arrest that the Scot had been a male prostitute. Genuine: Professor David Wilson, who met Nilsen, said the posts appear to 'genuinely the work of the serial killer' It is a description which has remained for 33 years and one his siblings can never accept. Mr Sutherland said: ‘One of our brothers is actually gay and laughed at the idea of Billy being homosexual. He was the biggest womaniser going. He had been married and gone on to have a son with another girlfriend. Knowing Billy, he probably thought Nilsen was being friendly towards him because they were both Scots. ‘I hate the fact every time I search on the internet for “Billy Sutherland” – which is also the name of my son – that a picture of my brother comes up with the words “male prostitute” next to a photograph of Nilsen.’ He added: ‘I’m angry that’s how my brother’s remembered and I’m angry Nilsen’s book is being published. This has to stop now. We’re not dealing with fiction here – real lives have been destroyed because of this man’s heinous crimes.’","Dennis Nilsen is serving a life sentence at Full Sutton prison near York .

Her tales have enchanted generations of English children and now Beatrix Potter is set to win another fan - baby Prince George. The Duchess of Cambridge has decorated his nursery with characters from Beatrix Potter's classic children's book, it has emerged. While Kensington Palace officials are said to have suggested antique furniture as more befitting a future king, Kate had her heart set on a Beatrix Potter theme. Classic tales: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured holding Prince George as she leaves St Mary's Hospital in London with husband Prince William, is believed to have chosen a Beatrix Potter theme for her son's nursery . And her mother-in-law Camilla took her side - insisting the nursery should be decorated to Kate's liking. A source told The Sun: 'Camilla has experience in dealing with the ""old grey men"". She put her foot down, saying it should be Kate's choice.' The pair are said to have become very close since Kate became pregnant with her first child George who was born on July 22. The source added that the Duchess loves how Camilla treats George like any grandchild who 'wees, vomits and does everything babies do'. With help from her mother-in-law, 31-year-old Kate is believed to have ordered that the nursery be decorated with characters from Beatrix Potter's books. Popular: Peter Rabbit, depicted eating radishes, is likely to be one of the Beatrix Potter characters adorning Prince George's walls . One of her most popular characters who is likely to adorn the Prince's walls is Peter Rabbit. The Tale of Peter Rabbit and his sisters Flopsy, Mopsy and Cotton-tail was first published more than 100 years ago but is still one of the most popular children's books today. Other famous characters include Jemima Puddle-Duck, Mrs Tiggy-Winkle, Tom Kitten and Miss Moppet. It has been speculated that kate and her husband Prince William are likely to have used the same design company that created nurseries for William himself, his brother Harry and their cousins Beatrice and Eugenie. Dragons of Walton Street in Knightsbridge specialise in handmade furniture painted with characters from Beatrix Potter, bears, flowers or fairies.

Experts have long been puzzled as to why young animals recover from injuries more quickly than adults. The gene, Lin28a, is highly active in unborn children, but does less and less with age. A 'fountain of youth gene' has been identified by scientists and helps explain why young people recover more quickly from injuries than adults . In tests on mice, it quickened the healing of wounds and sped up regrowth after a patch of fur was shaved. It also helped repair tissues in the ear after they were injured. Lin28a achieved all of these effects by increasing the production of several metabolic enzymes and enhancing metabolic processes that are normally more active in embryos. The Harvard Medical School scientists hope that waking the gene up in the adult body could speed up the healing of wounds after operations. Researcher George Daley said it may be possible to produce a drug that has the same effect as the gene. The gene, Lin28a, is highly active in unborn children, but does less and less with age . He added: ‘It sounds like science . fiction but Lin28a could be part of a healing cocktail that gives adults . the superior tissue repair seen in juvenile animals.’ He said: ‘Why some animals can fully regenerate organs when others cannot is a longstanding mystery of biology. ‘Our studies support the concept that mammalian tissue repair can be substantially improved by engineering the reactivation of genes that regulate juvenile developmental stages.’ The research is published in the journal Cell.","The gene, Lin28a, is highly active in unborn children, but does less with age .

At it alone: Kate, pictured before her pregnancy, will not be hiring a nanny to help with Prince George . At first, the news that the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge had decided not to hire a maternity nurse or a nanny seemed perfectly plausible to me. My son’s maternity nurse (in starched uniform with those horrid nursy black shoes) had some  pretty odd ideas. Permanently sleep deprived and not exactly a scholar to begin with, she believed that our friends and family were a repository of deadly germs and therefore should not be allowed to visit the baby at all. My son was virtually crawling before he met his grandparents. So good for you, William and Kate, not to be subjected to the madness of a maternity nurse. But you’re not hiring a nanny either? You what!? Hmm. Saying that you’re not hiring a nanny reminds me of those celebrities who claim they will never go under the knife and then do (and still pretend they did not, despite not being able to smile properly). The lady doth protest a bit much – and way too soon in my view. I get it, of course. Kate and  William want to be like other ‘normal’ parents – the sort who get up six times a night, have congealed vomit (and faeces) on their clothes and look as if they have survived a plane crash. Normal parents would chew off their right hand to have a bit of abnormality in their lives in the way of a trustworthy nanny who can take Prince George to the park and allow them the time to take a bath or, better yet, a nap. If only they had some spare cash. Normal parents don’t have a  full-time ‘housekeeper’ at home (as William and Kate do) or  the Millionaire Middletons as in-laws with mansions and endless staff milling about  either. Normal grandparents don’t want to change nappies or even babysit any more,  I hear. They’re too busy spending their children’s inheritance. What William and Kate are is ‘faux’ normal. They want to appear like harassed, sleep-deprived normal parents, without actually being them. Kate never looks anything other than immaculate with her blow-dried mane and pressed designer clothes – even now. Normal parents don’t look like that at this stage of life (I never got out of my nightie). I looked at the picture of Kate in her new blue polka-dot dress holding the newborn and wondered how many people it took to get her ready. I couldn’t bend over, let alone zip up a dress, at that stage. It’s all semantics. No one admits to having a nanny in 2013. Ever since the cult of parenting began in the 1990s, a nanny has become almost  a term of disparagement. Family: The Duchess of Cambridge, pictured as she departs The Lindo Wing with newborn George in her arms and husband by her side, it thought to be planning on relying on her parents for help in the early months of her son's life . By implication it means you have outsourced your God-given duty as a  parent to someone (inferior) else. Now that parenting is a political movement (complete with hostile guerrilla factions that man the web 24 hours a day), no one can admit that they don’t spend every minute of their day supervising (and enjoying) their infant’s every activity even if they work in an office from 9am to 6pm. It is taboo, almost as bad as incest, to discuss parenting in a tone any less earnest than might be used in the War Room of the Pentagon (with the Third World War about to break out). This state of affairs has made women, well, lie. I know professional women who march by my door daily on their way to work who claim not  to have a nanny. Did they leave their children alone, you wonder? They have (they confess defensively) ‘part-time housekeepers’ or ‘au pairs’ or ‘babysitters’. Most of these speak poor English, have no experience, are paid in cash and work double the legal working hours because they’re desperate. When not looking after the children all day and often night, they also  clean, iron, walk the dog and answer  the telephone. This is considered socially acceptable, whereas a qualified English nanny with experience who actually pays attention to your child and speaks English well enough to read to them, is not. The famous Norland Nannies (the sort that Prince Charles had) do still exist but mostly no longer wear uniforms or live in nurseries. The more common qualification is NNEB (National Nursery Examination Board), which means the women (and men) in question took the trouble to study infants, and did not arrive, as many now do, from abroad with no references but the willingness to work for half the wages in cash. I see the ‘au pairs’ through basement windows clutching a baby in one arm, a vacuum cleaner in the other and a mobile strapped to their ear at all times. A proper nanny maintains high standards so you can relax and concentrate on what you’re supposed  to be doing instead (attending state functions, working for charity, for example). An educated nanny will also be able to understand the revision Prince George will bring home (at age two). Helping hand: Duchess Of York employed nanny Alison Wardley to help with the upbringing of Princesses Beatrice and Eugenie . My nannies had a lot more experience with babies than I did and far more patience. I never outsourced my responsibilities as a parent to them, but boy was I grateful for  the time to work they offered me, especially in the early years. Still, it is now fashionable in London circles (certainly in Will and Kate’s) for wealthy, glamorous and famous women to boast about not having ‘help’, period. I see them (yummy mummies) taking their children to nursery school in immaculate ironed clothes, and I also see them jumping into their 4x4s to go to Pilates or the hairdressers afterwards. I never, ever, see them at pick-up. They know the other ‘hands-on-I-have-no-help’ mothers also never show up at pick-up so the coast is clear. It’s all faux parenting to me, a bit like the kind William and Kate are about to embark on unless they come to their senses. It’s the pretence I object to. Why has mothering gone the way of cooking where everyone lies about having made the three-course dinner from scratch when they clearly haven’t? No Norlands: There will be no nannies in strict uniforms for Prince George - if the Duke and Duchess are to be believed . Why can’t we admit that looking after small children is exhausting, frustrating, repetitive and help – if you can get some – makes it much more rewarding? I don’t begrudge the young Royals the posturing. I think it’s charming that they so badly want us to believe they are like us, when they are clearly not. Most of us are grateful to Kate for taking on a job that so few would if they had the full job description in front of them. Kate’s pregnancy – a source close to her tells me – was  a nightmare from the beginning. She has been unwell throughout but every time she appears in public she has to maintain the illusion of perfection and good health – how faux is that? But also, how admirable? This is the best of British characteristics, that ability to rise above how you ‘feel’. And besides, we really want to believe her, because we would all feel so bad if she looked downtrodden and depressed and sorry she signed up for the job and now can’t get out of it. We want our princesses to be fairytale-like and happy: the appearances are for us, not for them. We don’t want reminding of reality. Kate is our Walt Disney princess. Vomit on the designer sleeves doesn’t go with the picture. Here’s another argument for hiring a nanny, Kate. Your husband. It’s the first part of marriage that is the most testing and babies bring any simmering issues to the boil. Research suggests one very bad night without sleep can create the first cracks that eventually break the back of a relationship. I’m sure the Middletons (with whom Kate is staying) will take Prince George to the park and let the young marrieds pop out for a meal – but wait, they can’t do that either. They’re not normal, after all. Another reason to hire a proper nanny, Kate, is because if you become normal, who will administer all the boring official tasks you do daily, or sit through church services that most of us can blow off without too much backlash? Even if Prince George also goes to church, a nanny can keep him entertained so he doesn’t make a fuss and attract unflattering commentary from the world’s media. Parenting is a hellishly hard job. It’s difficult enough without also having to perform public duties and look good. Parenting politics also go the other way. Mothers who drag their tired children to restaurants because they couldn’t find a babysitter arouse a lot of vitriol, too. If Prince George screams in public because he missed his nap, you will get it in the neck, Kate. You can’t win. It’s just the beginning of a long and tiring journey: don’t try to be perfect or normal. Get a nanny, take a nap.","The Duke and Duchess will not be hiring a nanny for Prince George .

Jailed: Robert Hunter has been sentenced to 14 years after he abused young girls all over the world . A paedophile was jailed for 14 years today after posing as pop star Justin Bieber online to lure children from all over the world into sexual abuse. Robert Hunter's 'sadistic exploitation' of young girls was described by the judge as among the worst the British courts have ever seen. His abuse involved children as young as nine, and sparked an international operation led by Interpol. The 35-year-old used Facebook, Skype and MSN to abuse . girls across Europe, Asia, Canada and the United States. He . would also often pose as the singer Justin Bieber in an attempt to . convince the girls to expose themselves and perform sex acts on a . webcam. Teesside Crown Court heard that after being arrested in December 2012, he continued to target children and this resulted in a girl from Tasmania eventually contacting police, who traced him back to his home. In total, more than 800 videos and images were discovered on his computer. Richard Bennett, prosecuting, said: 'Over the course of 2010, 2011 and 2012, Hunter, using a number of online aliases, had pretended to a number of very young girls that he was a teenager. 'On each occasion he was able to disguise his true age and identity by the clever use of images of young boys or by pretending that his computer wasn't working properly. 'As a further demonstration of the naivete and innocence of his victims, he was also able to persuade some that he was the music artist Justin Bieber. 'He did this in order to dupe and encourage these young girls to strip on webcams and perform sex acts for him.' Terrible: Hunter even convinced some victims he was Justin Bieber and then convinced them to perform sex acts . Hunter also blackmailed some of the victims into agreeing to his demands by threatening to make the videos he had already made of them public. Sentencing Hunter to 14 years in prison, Judge Peter Bowers said it represented a callous and sadistic exploitation. 'This is one of the most serious cases on internet abuse that the courts have dealt with,' he said. 'It's a warning to all parents of teenage children of what can be done via the internet. 'The public will be disgusted by how you have behaved even after you had been arrested and bailed. 'It represents callous and sadistic exploitation of a number of girls over a number of years.' Shocking: Teesside Crown Court heard what the judge said was one of the worst paedophile cases the British justice system had ever seen .

As a child, Michelle Mone could often be found tidying the family kitchen while her friends played outside. Not, she says, because it was dirty but because her mother had not organised the shelves as she thought they ought to be. ‘She’d freak me out,’ says Michelle. ‘She would have soup tins in different cupboards instead of them being all together. It would upset me and I had to do something about it. Mum would love it and say, “Michelle’s organising the kitchen!” 'It makes me who I am': Michelle Mone, founder of lingerie brand Ultimo, has suffered from OCD most of her life . ‘Another thing that would panic me would be if she was wasn’t able to find a jumper. I have to know where everything is. Even today, my friends beg me to tidy their cupboards but it’s just normal for me to have everything in order.’ Order is a way of life for Michelle. The dynamic entrepreneur, founder of the Ultimo lingerie brand, is one of about three per cent of the UK population who suffer with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD). The mental health condition is characterised by obsessive thoughts that are only relieved by compulsive repetitive rituals that include washing, cleaning and checking. David Beckham famously claimed to have OCD, which manifested in a need to have everything around him in straight lines or in pairs. Symptoms of the disorder can range from mild to debilitating – many sufferers describe unwanted thoughts, such as becoming fixated by the worry that they may do unspeakable harm to themselves or others, and the anxiety caused by this can be overwhelming. Broken marriage: Michelle divorced ex Michael after she discovered that he had an affair with one of her bra designers at Ultimo - she later bought him out of the company . Yet, astonishingly, Michelle is . somewhat proud of the positive things OCD have given her. ‘I can cope . with anything in life,’ she says. ‘I have coped with chaos and it’s me that people come running to if . there is an issue. But I cannot function if I have a messy wardrobe. I . say to people, “Organise your drawers before you face the world.” ‘Do I want to stop it? No. I can cope with a hell of a lot more in business because of OCD. I know where things are, I work faster, and I can take on a lot more. DO I HAVE OCD? Symptoms vary. Some people spend less than an hour engaged in obsessive-compulsive  behaviour – for others it may consume  their whole day. The ocdaction.org.uk online survey should help determine if you should  visit your GP. TRIGGERSOCD may run in families and is linked to certain inherited genes that affect the brain’s development. The typical onset for OCD is between the ages of six and 15 for males, and 20 and 29 for women. Up to four per cent of women develop OCD during pregnancy or after giving birth. Brain-imaging studies have shown that those with OCD have abnormalities in some parts of the brain including increased activity and blood flow, plus a lack of serotonin. This chemical transmits information from one brain cell to another, and regulates anxiety, mood, memory and sleep. Medication that increases serotonin levels has proven effective in treating OCD. HOW CAN I STOP? Treatment is likely to involve behavioural therapy to help reduce anxiety. Disruption of daily function is described as functional impairment. OCD that causes mild impairment is usually treated with cognitive behavioural therapy – managing problems by changing the way you think and behave. If you have OCD that causes moderate functional impairment, you may be offered antidepressants. ‘Being organised has kept me in . control. My mum has said, “I don’t know how you’ve dealt with everything . and not had a breakdown.” ’ The . ‘everything’ Michelle is referring to is her ‘year of hell’, in which . her painful divorce was finalised. Her ex-husband Michael, who was also . her business partner, worked alongside her until his affair with a young . designer in 2011. Michelle, . 42, subsequently bought him out of Ultimo, and this month she did the . same with their other business, TrimSecrets, a herbal supplement that . she has taken herself for the past four years and which, along with a . serious workout regime, has helped her lose 7st. Despite her lifelong obsessions with sorting and extreme tidiness – and Michelle recognising her behaviour was unusual – she was diagnosed with OCD only in her 30s. She was making a TV programme at the time, and psychologists working on the same show noticed how she would repeatedly reorganise a room before she felt able to sit down. They suggested to  her that she was suffering from OCD and Michelle recognised the symptoms, though she has never sought professional help. She has, however, worked tirelessly to control her symptoms, which crept into her work life when she started Ultimo in 1996. Back then she felt the need to tidy the desks of other staff when they were not around but realised this obsession could not continue. ‘I have got better in the office,’ admits Michelle. ‘I’m now more aware of how I affect people and that you just can’t do that with their own space. ‘But I do insist that all A4 files that are left out must have the subject typed out in the same font and the same size. There must be no handwriting as it looks disgusting.’ Signs of OCD were more apparent in her former family home in Thorntonhall, near Glasgow – a house that had four dishwashers. ‘It sounds excessive as not everyone has a dishwasher, but we had the space and when we entertained friends for dinner I could not bear the idea of seeing dirty dishes in the sink as it would really upset me. 'Having those four dishwashers made me feel good.’ Mother-of-three Michelle has just . spent ten months overseeing the refurbishment of her new home, a . Victorian townhouse, using the furniture supplier of The Dorchester . where she stays when in London. ‘It . was a full-time job in itself even though I had a team working on it. I . oversaw all the plans and every last detail. Everything had to be . right,’ she says emphatically. Glamour queen: Michelle thanks her OCD for helping her get her life back together . ‘The handles have to be a certain way, the lights have to be in line. ‘The . obsessions have become worse as I’ve got older. For example, I can have . just got off a flight from China but if I walk into the kitchen and see . the salt left out, so there is a mess, I then have to check every . cupboard and go from room to room checking that everything is in order. ‘I . have to make sure each pillow is lined up. I have to check that my . wardrobe is organised. I have the same hangers and need to see them . lined up as I like them. Only then would I be able to sleep peacefully. ‘If I go into my son Declan’s bedroom, . I may say to him, “You do realise the pillow zips are up the wrong . way?” and when he’s not around, I fix it all. He says, “Mum, I don’t think you realise how tidy we are as a family!” ’ Mummy's little helper: Michelle, pictured age four, used to re-organise her mother's kitchen as a child . While Michelle and her relatives are used to her rituals, should an unsuspecting shop assistant ever hand over a crumpled bank note in change to Michelle, she will simply ask for another. ‘I have done that before now in Starbucks,’ she says. ‘How dare they give me something so crunched up and disgusting? I can’t bear it. All the notes in my purse are neat and must be lined up with the heads facing the right way and in order of fives, tens and twenties.’ Michelle’s way of doing things has also already proved a stumbling block in a relationship. ‘I have been single for a year but I was seeing a guy in Dubai,’ she confesses. ‘He didn’t like me fussing and told me to leave his pillows alone. I can’t understand how a guy would want to deal with a messy woman who leaves her make-up everywhere and has a messy wardrobe. If I was a guy I would throw her out.’ Besides her tidying rituals, Michelle’s habits extend to eating. ‘If I eat breakfast I have a white omelette with chilli and ham. And if I find a good restaurant I keep going back there. I don’t want to be disappointed by going somewhere else that I don’t know will be as good.’ Cognitive behavioural therapist Anna Albright explains what is going on in the mind of an OCD sufferer: ‘There are two components. The obsessional aspect is where a person churns the same thoughts over and over. 'This is an intrusive thought which they feel uncomfortable about.’ For example, there being germs everywhere. ‘This causes the psychological discomfort so they then go through a series of compulsive rituals to neutralise that discomfort, such as washing hands or lining up pencils.’ The exact causes of OCD are unknown although genetics are thought to be involved. A person with OCD is four times as likely to have a family member with the same condition. It is also thought to be related to other illnesses such as Tourette’s syndrome. Yet unlike so many sufferers who feel embarrassment and try to hide the condition, Michelle’s professional success – she was awarded an OBE in 2010 – has given her a confidence to confront every aspect of her personality. She says: ‘I haven’t inherited it from anyone and there is no sign of it in my children. But OCD defines who I am as a person. ‘I don’t think it’s an illness. I would say it’s what makes me perform so well and makes me unique.’ trimsecrets.com, ultimo.co.uk .","Lingerie tycoon Michelle Mone was diagnosed with OCD in her 30s .

The oldest woman to complete the New York City Marathon on Sunday - at age 86 - died just one day later, her family has revealed. But while Joy Johnson's relatives are mourning her passing, they agree it was an appropriate end for the grandmother, who once declared in an interview: 'I want to die running. That's my goal.' Johnson, from San Jose, California, was taking part in the race for the 25th time when she stumbled and hit her head on the road near mile 20. Medical staff wanted to take her to hospital, but she insisted on continuing. She completed the race and the next morning, she joined the Today show crowd at the Rockefeller Center with her sister, Faith Anderson, in what has become a post-marathon tradition for the pair. Scroll down for video . Her final race: Joy Johnson, 86, (pictured in 2008) passed away a day after completing the New York City Marathon on Sunday. But her family said it was the perfect way for her to go as she loved running . During a brief appearance on the show, host Al Roker inquired about the bandage over her eye and she dismissed it, saying: 'It looks much worse than it really is.' But after returning to her hotel room . later that morning, she said she was tired and took a nap - but she never . woke up, Anderson told the New York Daily News. Johnson was taken to Bellevue Hospital, where she was declared dead. 'At least she was running, the way she wanted to go,' her daughter, Diana Boydston, told the Daily News. It was Johnson's 25th time completing . the marathon, and her involvement this year made her the oldest woman . running the New York City Marathon since 2011. Appearance: Just hours before her death, Mrs . Johnson appeared on the Today show with Al Roker. She was wearing a . bandage on her face after her fall but insisted that 'it looked much worse than it is' Loss: After the Today show appearance she went for a rest at her hotel room and never woke up . The race was just the latest feat for the octogenarian, who started running aged 59. She had worked as a gym teacher and when she saw another teacher run by her house, she decided to join her. After that, she was hooked. Three years later, she and a former . teaching colleague were running 12 miles a day and planning their first . marathon. She completed it three months later, aged 61, in four hours, . 22 minutes. After that, she . went on to complete in about 11 races a year, including three marathons . and a selection of 12km runs and half marathons. On Sunday, she completed the marathon in . eight hours, which was far longer than at her peak in 1991, when she . finished in 3 hours, 55 minutes and 30 seconds. Aware that her times were slipping as she entered her 80s, she explained to the Wall Street Journal in 2008 that she was stepping up her exercise regimen. Feat: She completed the marathon in eight hours, becoming the oldest woman to finish on Sunday. Pictured, a sea of runners depart the Pulaski Bridge and head into the Queens borough of New York . While the cause of Mrs Johnson's death has not been released, she passed away a day after she hit her head on the road, raising the possibility that she suffered a concussion. A concussion is a brain injury which is sustained by a blow to the head or when the upper body is violently shaken. It can cause a headache, loss of consciousness or mental function, dizziness, nausea or fatigue. A blow to the head may even lead to bleeding in or around your brain and such bleeding can be fatal. Therefore medical staff suggest that anyone who suffers a head injury should see a doctor as soon as possible. In addition, you should not return to physical activity while symptoms of a concussion are present until you are medically evaluated. She described a brutal workout of leaving the house at 5am, running up bleachers at a local school and completing as many as 55 miles a week, but also conceded that she knew she would be walking for some parts of future marathons. In an interview a day before this year's race, she lamented that she was slowing down, but said she had remained focused - regularly going on eight-mile runs and completing 150 push ups. She said she felt in good health but that she was planning to run at her own pace and complete it. 'I'll be at the back of the pack, but I don't mind,' she said. 'I just praise the Lord I can get out of bed each morning and run. A lot of people my age are in wheelchairs.' She proudly posed for photographs with fans who knew her through the running community. 'I always say I'm going to run . until I drop,' she said, the New York Daily News reported. 'I'm going to die in my tennis shoes. I just . don't know when I'm going to quit.' She was preceded in death by her husband, Newell, who passed away 15 years ago.

Unofficial returns showed Mike Duggan defeating Wayne County Sheriff Benny Napoleon 55 percent to 45 percent. Napoleon conceded defeat late Tuesday in a race where he was outspent by Duggan by about 3-to-1 heading into Tuesday's election.

No his year: Here, Detroit mayor candidate Benny Napoleon concedes the race to Duggan during an election night watch party in Detroit . ‘I'm going to try to shorten Kevyn Orr's stay,’ Duggan told The Associated Press heading into the election. But the reality is that Duggan will have little power under emergency manager Kevyn Orr, who in July filed to take Detroit into bankruptcy. Duggan, an ex-county prosecutor and former chief of the Detroit Medical Center, said he wants to convince Orr's boss, Gov. Rick Snyder, to allow him to develop a team and a plan to resuscitate the city's fiscal condition if elected mayor.

Forty years ago, Detroit elected its first black mayor with Coleman Young. Since then, the 80 percent black city has opted for leaders that look like they do . Detroit has more than 30,000 vacant houses and buildings. Bing's administration has demolished about 10,000 empty and dangerous houses during his four-year term. But anything the new mayor wants done that requires money must first get Orr's approval. Snyder did not endorse a candidate, . but after testimony last week in bankruptcy court, he held firm in his . decision to appoint Orr and keep him in place until Detroit emerges from . bankruptcy and its finances are fixed.

Openness: Jo Swinson has urged women to talk to their male colleagues about their salaries in an attempt to close the gender pay gap . Women workers should ask their male colleagues how much they earn as ammunition in their fight for pay parity, the Equalities Minister has urged. Liberal Democrat Jo Swinson said the only way to close the 17.4 per cent gender pay gap was to ditch the ‘very British’ reluctance to discuss money. Many women do not realise they are being paid less than their male counterparts, Miss Swinson said. ‘I think sometimes there’s something very British in our culture where we don’t talk about money, and I think that holds women back. ‘If they realised they were earning significantly less than male colleagues at a similar level, that might be the catalyst they need to ask for a pay rise,’ she told Elle magazine, which is running a campaign on women’s pay. Ms Swinson added that the Government could implement legislation requiring large firms to reveal the pay gap between the genders unless voluntary measures are successful. She backed the Elle and Feminist Times campaign that encourages women to ask male colleagues about their salaries. Ms Swinson added: 'It’s not like everyone’s going to be comfortable about that, but trying to create a culture where people are open about these things can only help. 'One of the things that I think is brilliant about the Elle campaign is encouraging people to open up about their pay. It’s definitely something we should be encouraging women to feel confident about.' There is currently legislation in place which could force companies to report their gender pay gap. However, the Government has not enacted it - preferring its voluntary Think, Act, Report scheme encouraging companies to publish as much information as possible. But Ms Swinson said: 'I would agree that while the pay gap is reducing a bit, it’s not reducing enough, given that we’re 40 years on from the initial legislation to say that men and women ought to be paid equally. 'I think we need to recognise that the Government does have the power to impose equal pay audits, and it may well be that if we do not see success through Think, Act, Report, that might be the only way to make this happen.' Fair: The Minister said that large firms may be made to reveal the pay gap between the genders if voluntary schemes - such as the Think, Act, Report initiative - fail to succeed (library image) The Government did not enact plans, inherited from Labour, to make the pay audits mandatory, but it has given employment tribunals the power to force those who break equal pay laws to carry out the reviews. The minister added that people should be encouraged to describe themselves as feminists. 'We should be encouraging people to be happy to declare themselves as feminists. And I think in some sections of the media there is a tendency to associate feminism with bra-burning extremism. But it’s about very mainstream views about women’s role in society. 'We need to be very clear about claiming that word as something positive and I think that the new momentum behind a lot of feminist campaigns is exciting and is showing that there are still a lot of issues where we haven’t solved it. 'It’s not about hating men, this is about creating a society where men and women working together can achieve more, rather than being pitted against each other in stereotypical archaic roles.'","British reluctance to talk money 'holds women back', Jo Swinson said .

The Labour leader has been accused of 'willfully' averting eye-contact when asked about reopening the probe into election rigging in Scotland . Ed Miliband was accused of ‘wilfully averting’ his gaze from the vote-rigging scandal engulfing his party yesterday – as he refused seven times to reopen the inquiry into the activities of the Unite union. The Labour leader came under fire amid fresh evidence of the extraordinary pressure placed on Lorraine Kane, who sparked claims of Unite attempting to fix the selection of a candidate in Falkirk. But despite growing evidence of a cover-up, Mr Miliband conceded he had dismissed the new claims on the basis of one phone call to Mrs Kane from a senior Labour official. The scandal erupted over the summer when Mrs Kane and three other members of her family alleged they had been signed up as members of the Labour Party in Falkirk without their knowledge. That was at a time when Unite’s boss in Scotland Stevie Deans, who was also chairman of Falkirk West Labour Party, was trying to secure the seat for Karie Murphy, a close friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey. Labour launched an inquiry, but dropped it after Mrs Kane signed an affidavit which they claimed had appeared to change her testimony. In an explosive development, Unite last night admitted a solicitor hired by the union helped draw up that sworn statement. ‘Qualified solicitors from Bridge Litigation attended on the Kane family…and took statements from them clarifying their Party membership situation on August 1, 2013,’ said the statement. ‘Affidavits were then drafted by Bridge Litigation for members of the Kane family…On September 2, Bridge Litigation emailed the Labour Party copies of the affidavits from the Kane family.’ Mr Miliband is now facing claims that . the prospect of a confrontation with Len McCluskey is 'scaring' the . Labour leader since it would lead to a 'civil war' with his biggest . paymaster that could torpedo his leadership. Ms Kane and her family members were reportedly signed up to the Labour party without their knowledge or permission at a time when Karie Murphy (right), a friend of Unite boss Len McCluskey was chasing the seat . Unite's boss in Scotland Stevie Deans resigned from his role as Chairman of the Labour party's Falkirk constituency in the wake of the scandal . Labour insists that affidavit amounts to Mrs Kane withdrawing her original claims of wrongdoing. But the Unite statement says: ‘This was not a matter of the Kanes “withdrawing their evidence”. The Kanes were instead clarifying, or supplementing, the material in the “Falkirk report”.’ The Mail revealed on Monday that Mrs Kane had not changed her evidence. In a tape-recorded conversation with a Mail reporter, she said: ‘I did not change the testimony… I did not withdraw anything.’ Former Chancellor Alistair Darling has called for the investigation to be reopened . But Mr Miliband rejected that evidence yesterday – on the basis of one phone call by Labour’s general secretary Ian MacNichol to Mrs Kane on Monday. ‘We looked at that evidence,’ he said. ‘The General Secretary of the party spoke to the lady concerned and indeed her husband and they both confirmed that the evidence they gave us in September was the evidence they stand by.’ But that intervention has left Mrs Kane distraught. Yesterday she told the Mail the ongoing saga was ‘destroying’ her. A friend of Mrs Kane said she was ‘manipulated’ and that she had no idea the affadavit was to be used to shelve the investigation into her original complaint. Both former Chancellor Alistair Darling and Labour’s Scottish leader Johann Lamont have called for the investigation to be re-opened. Repeatedly asked by journalists why he would not reopen the inquiry, Mr Miliband said: ‘We’ll look at any new evidence.’ However, Labour officials have not even asked to hear the Mail’s tape of its interview with Mrs Kane. Atul Hatwal, editor of the pro-Labour blog Labour Uncut, last night claimed Mr Miliband was frightened of confronting Unite. He wrote: ‘The party appears to be wilfully averting its gaze. Ed Miliband was wrong today when he said that no new information had come to light on Falkirk.’ Mr Hatwal said if Mr Miliband orders an investigation, Len McCluskey will kill off his plans to recast Labour’s relationship with the unions at a special conference in the spring. ‘It’s difficult to imagine a situation where the weakness of the leader was more viscerally demonstrated than to be defeated in such a manner. 'This is the nightmare scenario which is scaring the leader’s office and is why they are  petrified of re-opening the Falkirk inquiry,’ said Mr Hatwal. QUESTION: Why . are you so convinced there hasn’t been bullying and intimidation in . Falkirk by Unite officials? Don’t you think that you haven’t reopened . the inquiry there smacks of weakness and a cover-up? MILIBAND: The . candidate around whom there was controversy has withdrawn and is no . longer the candidate. The party there is in special measures. We have . ended the union joining scheme under which people were signed up. No . members recruited under that scheme will be allowed to vote in the . selection ... We’ve had one police inquiry, which was initiated by the . Labour Party. We now have a second police inquiry. On top of all that, . I’ve embarked on an  absolutely major reform of our party. I’m . absolutely determined we don’t have a repeat of Falkirk anywhere. Q: Alistair Darling doesn’t think it was enough, though? M: What . Alistair was saying was that we should look at any new evidence there . is. Yesterday evidence was supposedly  produced by one newspaper, the . Daily Mail. We looked at that evidence. The General Secretary of the . party spoke to the lady concerned and indeed her husband and they both . confirmed that the evidence they gave us in September was the evidence . they stand by. Q: Compare . and contrast, Alistair Darling: ‘You just can’t leave matters as they . are’, and the leader of the Labour Party  appearing to say: ‘There’s . nothing more I can do.’ Why? M: I . believe there was machine politics in Falkirk which needed to be dealt . with. That’s why we’ve taken such comprehensive action... I’m embarked . on the biggest reform of the Labour Party that there’s been for a . generation. Q: Alistair . Darling said there should be a new, thorough, inquiry into Falkirk, not . into reform of the Labour Party. He said Labour should do it if the . police don’t move to prosecutions. Can you silence these questions now . by simply saying if the police can’t prosecute, ‘I will open a new . inquiry into Falkirk’? M: I . think the right thing to do is to look at any new evidence that is . presented... I think the Falkirk Labour Party should get on with the . business of reconnecting with the  people of Falkirk, selecting a new . candidate and we will get on with the business of reforming our party. Q: All . the things you have just listed that you have done... shows that . something has gone badly wrong and you have not got to the bottom of it . and people are going to think that you are not pursuing this. M: I think what it shows is that we have taken action on the evidence. Q: It’s . not just Alistair Darling. Johann Lamont [Scottish Labour Party leader] . too has said the circumstances in Falkirk  need looking at; Tom Harris . [Labour MP  for Glasgow South] as well. Isn’t there a danger that Labour . politicians in Scotland are saying one thing and you’re saying . another? M: Johann was asked about that Daily Mail story. She rightly said, in my view, we need to look at it – and that’s what we did. Q: You . said earlier that David Cameron only stands up to the weak, not the . strong. Would we not be forgiven for thinking  that you’ve done exactly . the same with Len McCluskey and Tom Watson. On a scale of 1 to 10 just . how frightened of them are you? M: We . took the Mail story seriously. It’s right to take seriously any new . evidence that’s presented by people. That’s why we checked it out with . the family concerned ... We’re determined to deal with what  happened in . Falkirk and determined to change our relationship with union members.","Labour leader responded vaguely to questions surrounding the scandal .

Newly-released footage taken from police body cameras have revealed the dramatic moment officers opened fire on a former NFL player as he was apparently about to stab his girlfriend. The video shows two officers shooting former New York Giants recruit Jermaine Green, 32, six times as he held Katrina Johnson, 37, at knifepoint in a home in Daytona Beach, Florida in September. Both sustained non-fatal gunshot wounds; Green was shot in the hip, abdomen and right arm, while Johnson was hit with a seventh bullet in her right arm, the footage shows. It was released as authorities investigate whether officers Richard Maher and Kevin Connelly were justified in opening fire during the September 25 incident. Scroll down for video: WARNING: GRAPHIC CONTENT . Tense: Officers can be seen raising their weapons as they head towards a domestic dispute in Florida . Struggle: In the bedroom they find Jermaine Green pinning his girlfriend Katrina Johnson down on top of him. The former NFL player has her in a choke hold with his left arm and a knife in his right hand . 'I'm proud of what the officers did,' Dayton Beach Police Chief Mike Chitwood told the Orlando Sentinel. 'Everybody went home to their families.' Three officers had been called to the home just after 3am after receiving two 911 calls about a fight and domestic dispute between the couple, the Daytona News-Journal reported. Chitwood said the row between Green and Johnson had started a day earlier when Green allegedly hit his girlfriend over the head with a brick, although this was not reported to police. Officers arrived at the home to find concerned relatives running from the home in their pjamas. They tell the pair that they had tried to stop the fight but that Green had gone 'crazy'. The footage shows them kicking the . door down to see Green, who then pulls Johnson into a bedroom. With . their weapons raised, they inch into the room.

They see Green raise his right arm slightly and then come down rapidly - in an apparent attempt to stab his girlfriend. 'He's doing it,' the policeman said to his partner - before seven shots rang out in the room. What follows is chaos as both Green and Johnson are hit in the series of bright flashes. One officer helps Johnson get up, but Green remains slumped on the floor. They were taken to Halifax Health Medical Center, where Green was listed in critical condition and was in the intensive care unit for several days. Fight: Green, left, allegedly attacked his girlfriend, Katrina Johnson (pictured right in an earlier mug shot) a day after he allegedly hit her over the head with a brick.

Heather Abbott wore flats before she became one of the many people to lose a leg in the Boston, Mass Marathon bombings. She calls herself a 'professional heel-wearer' and preferred heels that reached the towering height of 4 inches. On Thursday, she showed off a new prosthetic that will help her reclaim a little bit of her personal style: a 'high-definition' realistic silicone leg that can be worn with high heels. To showcase it, she broke out a pair of black leather Nine West shoes with peep-toed 4-inch spiked heels that displayed painted red nails on both feet. It is almost impossible to tell just by looking that the prosthetic is not real. Heather may have lost her leg but her new stylish prosthetic shows that he hasn't lost her sense of style . 'I can't believe how much it looks like a real foot,' Abbott said. Abbott, 38, of Newport, R.I. was going in to the Forum restaurant in Boston with friends on April 15 when one of two bombs went off a short distance away. Her left leg was badly hurt. She had to make the difficult decision to amputate it below the knee. 'One of my biggest concerns was, what it was going to look like,' she said on Thursday. Then she met a woman at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston who had a similar leg and could wear high heels. Friends call Boston Marathon survivor Heather Abbott ' a professional heel wearer' 'That's what made me know it was going to be OK,' she said. Abbott got her first prosthetic leg in June, and has also gotten prosthetics for running and for going in the ocean so she can resume her hobby of paddle boarding. She got the high-heeled prosthetic about a week ago from Next Step Bionics and Prosthetics, a Manchester, N.H.-based company with offices in Warwick and Newton, Mass. It treats seven of the people who lost legs in the bombing, its president, Matthew Albuquerque, said. 'I cant believe how much it looks like a real foot,' Abbott said of her silicone leg that can wear high heels . Next Step built the interior of the prosthetic; the shape is a mirror image of Abbott's right leg and foot. The silicone cover was constructed by the British company Dorset, which matched the color to Abbott's skin and added details such as freckles. Abbott noted it even looks like it has a little bit of razor burn. The foot can even be given a pedicure. The cover cost $15,000, while the cost of the inside of the leg can cost anywhere from $8,000 to $10,000, Albuquerque said. Abbott's prosthetic was covered by insurance, but he said that doesn't always happen. 'Having a leg look like a leg sounds like something that should be very basic, but it's not,' Albuquerque said. Abbott said she has felt self-conscious wearing skirts because her other prosthetics don't look real. But on Thursday she was wearing a skirt that hit just below the knee. Albuquerque said most people would not be able to walk in heels after just a few months with a prosthetic, but he calls Abbott determined. The company also normally would not make a prosthetic for a 4-inch heel - usually at most two or three inches - but that's what Abbott wanted. She said after just a week with the new leg, she's still re-learning how to walk in heels.'I'll get there,' she said. 'Eventually.' Heather Abbott was all smiles on Thursday while showing off her 4 inch heels on a high-definition prosthetic leg .","Heather Abbott calls herself a 'professional heel-wearer' and preferred heels that reached the towering height of 4 inches .

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 02:00 EST, 6 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:59 EST, 6 November 2013 . Republican New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie won a second term in a deep-blue Democratic state, a feat that he'll argue makes him the ideal GOP frontrunner for 2016 . In a night that gave both sides of America's political gridiron something to carp about, Democrats seized whatever momentum was there to take and moderate Republicans finally saw a candidate that could help the party shake off the Tea Party influence. Chris Christie won re-election handily in New Jersey, becoming the first Republican to win more than 50 per cent of the vote in a statewide election since George H.W. Bush did it in 1988. But the incredible shrinking governor definitely isn't a tea party stalwart. The closest facsimile of Sen. Ted Cruz running on a major GOP ballot Tuesday was Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli. He lost the governor's race there to Terry McAuliffe, the former Bill Clinton fundraiser who hung a 'for rent' sign on the Lincoln Bedroom door and pulled in $34 million of his own for Tuesday's squeaker. Cuccinelli raised just $20 million. Republicans like Christie who have learned how to win in a heavily Democratic 'blue' state like New Jersey, can win anywhere – even in states where Democrats hold an organizing advantage. That's a song Christie's camp will be singing from tomorrow through the 2016 GOP nominating convention. If it takes the odd embrace of a Democratic president to make it happen, as Christie did after Superstorn Sandy, then so be it. And Republicans like Cuccinelli, who bank on their states staying 'red' forever, will always be disappointed when real-world issues intervene. Scroll down for video . Love her or hate her, Hillary Clinton is back. And it's Bill who's sowing political good will for her among key Democrats -- like old pal Terry McAuliffe -- whose support she'll need in 2016 . Not enough: Republican Ken Cuccinelli lost the Virginia governor's race because he allowed himself to be pigeonholed as a far-right tea partier, something even the death spiral of Obamacare wasn't helpful enough to overcome . Virginia's demographic shifts since 2009 are astounding: White voters were 78 per cent of the state's voters in 2009, and are down to 72 per cent just four years later. The influx of black and Hispanic voters has given Democrats a reliable base and a hedge against Obamacare-like disasters. Combined with a sharply growing federal government workforce in Virginia's northern counties – another group that votes Democrat by a generous majority – Virginia is no longer part of the reliably Republican deep South. Neither is Florida, judging from the last two presidential elections. If the GOP takes any so-called 'purple' state for granted in 2016, it's lights out and an Inaugural Ball for Madame President Hillary Clinton. The ray of sunshine for Republicans comes from Washington, D.C., where President Obama's approval numbers are under 40 per cent for the first time. The wildly unpopular Affordable Care Act, along with scandals in Obama's justice, treasury, state and defense departments, have made campaigning with him a risky venture. While that won't matter much in 2016, Obama's lame-duck year, it spells trouble for Democrats in 2014. Past performance may not be indicative of future results: Liberal Democrat Bill de Blasio won the New York City mayor's race, but it's unwise to read broader implications into the outcome, just as Michael Bloomberg's tenure wasn't a sign of Republicanism run amok in the Big Apple . Virginia Democratic Governor-elect Terry McAuliffe won by freezing his opponent in tea-party carbonite and not letting him escape the imaginary ghetto of the far right wing. Democrats can keep doing that, and they'll keep winning . In Virginia on Tuesday, Cuccinelli managed to close an 11-point gap to just 2-1/2 percentage points, largely by harping on Obamacare. His own right-wing credentials hurt him – half of Virginia voters told exit pollsters that he was 'too conservative' – but playing on Obama's negatives was almost enough to cut through that disadvantage. Too soon? Sen. Ted Cruz, the tea party's biggest standard-bearer, is already scoping out Iowa and New Hampshire in advance of 2016, but his brand of quasi-libertarian politics may never catch on enough for him to win beyond Texas . So Republicans who can shake their images as social-issue tea party warriors will have a leg up in races that become referenda on Obama and his health insurance overhaul. In 2014, Obamacare will be the only show in town. A large majority of voters in exit polls Tuesday said the economy remains their top concern, occupying their minds far more than health care, abortion, or any other hot-button issue. It really is, still, 'the economy, stupid.' In Colorado, for instance, a proposed $950 million income tax hike for education lost by a massive 66-34 margin despite backing from Gov. John Hickenlooper and New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg – who put $1 million of his own money into the effort. Republicans can keep winning, at least in local and district-wide races, by casting themselves in the role of superheroes fighting the evils of tax-and-spend liberalism. Similar messaging helped the GOP retain firm control of the Virginia General Assembly on Tuesday, despite losing the statewide governor's race. As long as the GOP remembers that, it will keep control of the House of Representatives after the 20134 election. But whether the House ends up vastly more Republican or only slightly so, the real game is in the U.S. Senate where Republicans hold 45 seats and are aching to reach 51. Next year, 33 senators will face re-election, including 13 Republicans and 20 Democrats. Most models show the GOP picking up at least four of those, with three more rated as toss-ups. All 20 of those Democrats voted to pass the Affordable Care Act. Should both houses of Congress fall under Republican control, Barack Obama's last two years in office will be difficult ones. And if the Obamacare system is in mid-crumble by then, the Obama legacy-builing effort will be at a standstill. Bromance: New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie caught flak from his own party for chumming up with Barack Obama after Superstorm Sandy, but more than 60 per cent of the Democratic-majority state either liked him more or forgave him . Scratching that itch: Former President Bill Clinton has at least one more political season in him, and his popularity is far greater than President Obama's at the moment . Liberals won a key victory Tuesday in New York City, a progressive enclave that curiously had kept Democrats out of Gracie Mansion since 1993. But Hizzoner Bill de Blasio's new post is less of a sign of Democratic Party power than a course correction that was inevitable in a city that largely treats Republicans as a ghettoized minority. In order to win anywhere else, Democrats will have to take a page from the Terry McAuliffe playbook: Raise ungodly sums of money, spend heavily on negative ads, isolate your opponent against women and minorities. Lather, rinse, repeat. Small coattails: Barack Obama's ratings are in the tank, making his brand of help the one thing Democrats shouldn't rush out to vie for. He told supporters on Monday that he has one last campaign to fight -- and it's over his own flailing health care law, not anyone's electoral fortunes . Republicans, meanwhile, need to resolve the inner turmoil between the tea party and the moderate wing of Chris Christie-types who seem to be getting along with far less storm and stress. Now that the Obamacare battles have been fought and the law seems to be withering on its own vine, the larger tea party movement will still have its place. But the more it becomes a central focus for the GOP, the easier it will be for Democrats to pick off its candidates, one by one. Even in Alabama, a state tailor-made for flag-waving tea partiers, the more conservative candidate lost  Republican congressional primary on Tuesday night. The Republican primary presented a classic clash between the two sides of the Republican Party. Bradley Byrne was the establishment, pro-business candidate. He ended up six points ahead of tea partier Dean Young. It's one thing if the tea party can't win in New Jersey. But in Alabama? It seems inevitable that Christie . will end up staring down Sen. Ted Cruz for the Republican presidential . nomination in less than three years, with the winner drawing Hillary . Clinton for the main event. The Grand Old Party will need to do some soul-searching before then.","Given his rapport with Democrats and independents, it's tough to argue Chris Christie isn't the Republican to beat in 2016 .

In a 2012 interview that has resurfaced this week, the 75-year-old said that the movie opened his eyes to the unrealistically high expectations placed on women's physical appearance. Mr Hoffman told the American Film Institute that transforming into a woman who was not conventionally attractive made him realize he had spent a lifetime judging women by their looks.

Emotional: In a 2012 interview that has resurfaced this week, Dustin Hoffman chokes back tears as he opens up about feeling 'brainwashed' about the typical notion of female beauty . Epiphany: The 75-year-old said dressing as a woman in 1982 film Tootsie opened his eyes to the unrealistically high expectations placed on women's physical appearance . 'I went home and started crying,' he recounted, explaining that he told his wife that he knew then that he had to make this movie. When she asked why, he responded: . 'Because I think I am an interesting woman when I look at myself on . screen. And I know that if I met myself at a party, I would never talk . to that character,' he confessed. 'Because she doesn't fulfill physically the demands that we're brought up to think women have to have in order to ask them out.' 'There's too many interesting women I have not had the experience to know because I have been brainwashed' The actor then choked back tears as he recounted the realization that he had at that time. 'There's too many interesting women I have. . . not had the experience to know in this life because I have been brainwashed,' he says he told his wife. The father-of-six, who has been . married to his attorney wife Lisa for 32 years, said that he asked to do . a make-up test before signing onto the film, because he wanted to make . sure he could make for a convincing woman. Unconventional beauty: The actor tears up as he says he took the role (right) 'because she doesn't fulfill physically the demands that we're brought up to think women have to have in order to ask them out' Tragic undertones: In the interview, the actor's voice trembles as he says that because of his epiphany, the lighthearted movie was 'never a comedy for me' When Columbia Pictures transformed him into the role, he confessed that he was 'shocked' to see that he wasn't more attractive. 'I said ""Now you have me looking like a . woman, now make me beautiful,""' he recounts in the interview. 'I thought if I was going to be a woman, I would want to be as beautiful as possible' 'I thought . I should be beautiful if I was going to be a woman, I would want to be . as beautiful as possible.' When the make-up artists told him they couldn't make him any more conventionally attractive than they already had, that's when the actor had his epiphany. His voice trembles as he says that for that reason, the lighthearted movie was 'never a comedy for me'. Mr Hoffman was nominated for an Oscar for Best Actor for his role in the film.","Dustin Hoffman starred in 1982 film Tootsie as an actor who dresses as a woman in order to find work .

The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena on Friday to compel Todd Park, the chief technology officer at the White House, to testify at a hearing next week about what went wrong with the Obamacare website.The White House called the subpoena 'unfortunate and unnecessary' and said that Park was busy fixing the website. The White House earlier had said he was willing to appear voluntarily in December.'We had hoped the committee would work with us to find an alternative date to give Todd time to focus on the immediate task at hand: getting the website fixed,' said Rick Weiss, a spokesman for the White House Office of Science and Technology.

'We are reviewing the subpoena and will respond as appropriate,' Weiss said.Darrell Issa, the California Republican who chairs the committee, told Park that he was the only administration witness at the November 13 hearing who was 'unwilling to appear voluntarily' and noted that he had taken time out to give an interview to the New York Times in early October. 'Millions of Americans have lost their health insurance,' Issa wrote in a letter to Park. 'They deserve your sworn testimony before their elected representatives about what went wrong - not simply the media outlets that White House officials have deemed an appropriate use of your time,' he said. The HealthCare.gov website, which launched October 1, was meant to be an easy way for Americans to shop for health insurance and see whether they were eligible for subsidies under President Barack Obama's signature healthcare program. Technical issues: The Obamacare website has been beset by problems since it launched . But it has been plagued by myriad technical woes, and contractors and outside experts have been working around the clock to try to make it work by the end of November so that Americans have enough time to sign up for insurance before deadlines in the law.On Friday, Jeffrey Zients, the White House official charged to oversee the fixes, said the website is improving but is still 'a long way from where it needs to be.'A successful healthcare IT developer before joining the Obama administration, Park has been part of the scramble to repair the website. Priorities: Chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee Darrell Issa wants Park to testify before the Obamacare website is fixed . Earlier on Friday, the White House had scolded Issa for failing to justify why the hearing with Park could not be slated for December.'There will be ample time to analyze why the technology behind the website did not perform well initially, and whether there are any lessons learned for federal IT acquisition policy that Congress may want to address,' said Donna Pignatelli, assistant director for legislative affairs for the Office of Science and Technology Policy in a letter to Issa.'Mr Park is not going anywhere,' Pigantelli had said.","The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee issued a subpoena for chief tech officer Todd Park Friday .

A five-year-old cancer patient who had to have his leg amputated is thought to have become the first child in the UK to receive a power-assisted ‘robot’ leg. Eddy Parry, from Derby, was forced to have his leg amputated in May this year after he develop a large cancerous tumour. Instead of having a straight-forward amputation, his parents asked the surgeon to design a specialist procedure which would allow him to use his stump to control a prosthetic. Eddy Parry, five, has osteosarcoma - a rare form of bone cancer. His parents believe he is the first child in the UK to be fitted with a power-assisted 'robot' leg . His father, Jon, 40, said: ‘The surgeon was pleasantly surprised at our suggestion and gave it some serious thought - telling us this has never been done before in a child and he couldn’t see why not. ‘Because we knew what was coming, we were all sat on the bed and looking at what prosthetic legs were out there. ‘But they all seemed cumbersome and we knew that, if he had some form of stump, it would be easier to attach the leg to. ‘It just seemed like a logical step to try to help Eddy going forward, giving him the ability to attach a prosthetic leg to a stump - therefore giving more control on eventually walking again.’ Rather than completely amputating Eddy’s left leg, the muscles and tendons in his thigh were preserved and a metal implant was inserted to replace the bone. Eddy’s artificial leg can now be attached to the metal implant. Eddy's father said: 'We have come so far already and we are still fighting to save our son's life. The horrible truth is, we don't know if this terrible disease will return or not - we just know there is a high possibility that it will' Eddy (pictured with his parents, Jon and Claudia) had to have his left leg amputated in May but his parents asked the surgeon to leave a stump behind so it would be easier for him to control a prosthetic . The technique has been used in adults but the Royal Orthopaedic Hospital in Birmingham, where Eddy’s pioneering operation was carried out, said it was the first time it had been done on a child in the UK. Eddy’s parents, Jon Parry and Claudia Cassner, have supported the youngster through his battle with osteosarcoma - a form of bone cancer – and have seen him undergo 45 chemotherapy sessions and 26 blood transfusions since he was diagnosed in August 2012. They were devastated to hear Eddy would need an amputation but they knew it was the only chance of keeping the five-year-old alive. Eddy had the 'robot' leg fitted shortly after the amputation and he has now taken his first unaided steps with it but his parents say he has a long way to go before he can walk confidently with it . Mr Parry, 40, said: ‘You obviously don’t want your son to lose his leg and, if we’d been told he would when he was first diagnosed, it would have been a horrible shock. ‘But, at this point, we were half expecting it and, given the extent of the tumour in his leg at that point, we were told there was no way of saving Eddy’s leg. And we were fighting for our son’s life - that’s what was important to us.’ Ms Cassner, 40, said: ‘Eddy absolutely loves football and going outside - it means everything to him. ‘The robot leg was a complicated idea . but we were so keen to pursue it because we thought, if it doesn’t work, . there was no other option anyway - we had to give it a try.’ Mr Parry said that Eddy is now taking some unaided steps. He said: ‘We have a long way to go before he can walk at a pace unaided -but we will get there. ‘There was a lot of uncertainty about how Eddy would get on with the implant but he has had good control and strength. Since he was diagnosed, Eddy has had 45 chemotherapy sessions and 26 blood transfusions . ‘Now I’m trying to get a company on board to develop a child’s power-assisted leg. These do exist but only for adults.’ Mr Parry said: ‘We have come so far already and we are still fighting to save our son’s life. ‘The horrible truth is, we don’t know if this terrible disease will return or not - we just know there is a high possibility that it will. ‘But Eddy is a strong and courageous lad and an example to us all.’ Osteosarcoma is a rare type of sarcoma of the bone. It is most common in growing bones and is usually diagnosed in teenagers and young adults. It can affect any bone in the body but is most common in the arms and legs. The cause of the cancer is unknown but it is thought to be related to rapid bone growth. The most common symptom is pain, but the tumour can also cause swelling and tenderness. It is sometimes diagnosed when a bone weakened by the cancer breaks during a minor accident. Source: Macmillan .","Eddy Parry has osteosarcoma - a rare form of bone cancer .

Two sisters who were both sexually abused by their next door neighbour in their childhood have successfully waged a war to bring him to justice, 40 years later. Sisters Debbie Grafham, 47 and Laraine Delgiudice, 45,  were subjected to a horrific campaign of abuse by Patrick Ryan, 64, who lived in the flat above theirs in Blackheath, south-east London. Over 40 years later, the two sisters have waived their right to anonymity after successfully seeing their abuser brought to justice, in the hope that their story will encourage other victims to speak out. Sisters Laraine (left,aged 5), and Debbie (right, aged 7) suffered three years of abuse in secret . Laraine (left) and Debbie (right) have spoken about their story in the hope that it will encourage others to come forward about abuse . Debbie was nine-years-old and Laraine just seven when Patrick began to abuse them. The abuse continued in secret for three years, between 1974 and 1978, until the girls moved house. Patrick was jailed for 12 years in June this year at Woolwich Crown Court. Debbie recalls: ‘One day Laraine had gone upstairs to play while Mum was at her cleaning job. I’d gone to the park two minutes away with friends.  But I popped back briefly. ‘As I opened the door I could hear Laraine screams upstairs. Patrick was found guilty of four rapes, two attempted rapes and 7 counts of indecent assault against the sisters, and sentenced to 12 years . ‘Dashing up, horror filled my eyes.  Pat was on top of Laraine on the landing, abusing her.  She was crying, he was shouting.' Although Debbie managed to pull Patrick off her sister, he then used the threat of abusing her further to begin abusing Debbie. ‘Patrick told me “If you don’t want me to touch your sister then I’ll do it to you.  But my brother’s a policeman and if you tell he’ll take you away” ‘I was nine, her big sister, I wanted to keep her safe.  But he started abusing me, touching me, he raped me too,’ Debbie says. Patrick continued to abuse them both for years. ‘Our lives were hell but we kept the abuse secret.  After three years we moved -  a relief - but the damage was done. ‘Loraine struggled at school, I grew depressed, suffered panic attacks. Mum knew we’d changed but had no idea why.’ she says. Although both sisters went on to marry and have children, the abuse continued to blight their lives and they suffered psychological trauma as a result of their experiences. Debbie suffered from anorexia and mood swings while Laraine struggled with alcohol. The breaking point came when Larine nearly died from liver failure and entered a rehab facility. ‘I went round to see her one day,’ Debbie says, ‘she was in a terrible state. Her skin was yellow, she was near collapse.’ Debbie rushed Larriane to hospital and was told she would be lucky to live through the night . Larraine pulled through, but her liver was damaged and she was in hospital for months detoxing. However she started drinking again and was re-admitted and while there she fell and broke her pelvis. Although both sisters went on to marry and have children, the psychological damage of the abuse remained. Pictured is Debbie on her wedding day with Laraine as her bridesmaid . This time when she vowed to stop . drinking she did, and also made the brave decision to open up about the . abuse she had suffered in childhood. Debbie says: ‘While she was in rehab  I had a visit from the police. ‘Laraine had told a social worker about her past. Now the police were asking if I’d make a statement. ‘Nearly 40 years had passed. I was afraid of speaking out  after having kept our secret so long. But at the same time I knew  this was my chance to make sure that twisted paedo finally paid for what he'd done. '”He raped me too,” I said simply. ‘That night I went to see Laraine in hospital and told her.  She was shocked as she'd no idea he'd done it to me too. Debbie Grafham gave evidence in person at the trial . ‘We told our husbands and they were so supportive and a few weeks later the police arrested and charged him.' Five months later case went to trial at Woolwich Crown Court. Laraine had been bed-bound since her fall but she gave evidence via video link, but Debbie spoke in court in front of Patrick. ‘I wanted to be there to make him watch me - as he’d made me watch him - as I told the court all the sick things he’d done,’ Debbie says. The jury returned a unanimous verdict and Patrick was found guilty of four rapes, two attempted rapes and 7 counts of indecent assault against the sisters, and sentenced to 12 years. Debbie says: ‘He shouted and swore at me as he was led down.  But finally we'd got justice. ‘Now Laraine and I want to start again. We owe it to ourselves and our families.  And I know one day soon, now it’s all over my little sis will be properly back up on her feet again. Laraine says: ‘I didn't speak about the abuse for years because he made me feel ashamed. I almost drank myself to death to blot out what he’d done but Debbie and my family made me see sense just in time. ‘I know now none of it was my fault and I want to make up for all those lost years, start living again . 'Me and Debbie are living poof that justice can be done even years after.  So if you're living under the shadow we lived under, tell someone. Speak out.  It will be hard, but you wont' regret it.'","Debbie Grafham and Laraine Delgiudice abused for three years as children .

The East India Company, through trade, conquest and colonisation helped transform the culture and history of both Britain and India. The force of the Company, combined with Britain's long imperial rule in India was the catalyst for far reaching changes and a steady migration of Asians from all walks of life west, to set up home in the UK. Following the 1857 Indian Uprising, the Company was abolished and the British Crown took direct control of the Indian Government. That control and the period of the British Raj lasted nearly a century. The 17th Century saw a rise in migration of Asians to Britain. Servants and ayahs, Asian nannies, were brought back by British families returning home after spending time in the British ruled country. Ayahs were often left stranded as families failed to honour the promise of a ticket home. A group of Asian teenagers outside a cinema in 1980, left.

Indian sailors, known as lascars, crewed ships and steam-powered liners to and from the subcontinent. The harsh working conditions and poor pay lead to many lascars jumping ship to settle in British ports. They became the earliest Asian working class group in the country. And the lascars took up arms and fought alongside British forces in World War One and Two. Meanwhile intellectuals, politicians and activists campaigned in Britain for Indian independence, equality and social justice. The coming of steam-powered liners, and the 1869 opening of the Suez Canal, connecting the Mediterranean and Red Sea, reduced the journey times between both countries. One enterprising Asian, featured in the . book, is Sake Dean Mahomed. Having served in the East India Company's . Bengal Regiment, he settled in Ireland in 1784. In 1810 he opened the . first Asian restaurant run by an Asian, the Hindoostanee Coffee House in . London. When that venture failed, he moved to Brighton in 1814. There he set up Mahomed's Baths, offering treatments, massage, steamed baths of aromatic Indian herbs and oils to people suffering muscular ailments. It's success made Mahomed famous and people flocked to the baths, with many doctors recommending patients visit. In 1822, King George IV gave him the official role of the King's personal shampooing surgeon, a role extended during William IV's reign. In the aftermath of World War One a new group of working-class Asians arrived in Britain, often working as pedlars while living in poor areas with run-down housing. These early settlers established places of worships, and formed the basis of the first Asian communities with vibrant clubs, societies and shops.

Fins Swimming Club have expressed ‘great sadness’ at Gregor's death and passed on their sympathies to his family. Senior coach Graham Irvine said he was struggling to take the tragedy in. He said: ‘Gregor had been at the club as long as I can remember and we were looking to develop him into an athlete as he moved through adolescence. Promising athlete: Gregor's peers within his swimming squad said he would be greatly missed . ‘He will be missed greatly by his peers within the squad as they spend a considerable time with each other training and become more like family than friends. ‘His confidence and cheeky ways will be how I remember him most as we come together as a club to try and come to terms with the pain and unfairness of his passing.’ Derek Allan, Rector of Kirkcaldy High School where Gregor was a student, said today that both pupils and staff were shocked and saddened by his death. He said: ‘Our thoughts are with his family and his many friends during this very difficult time. ‘Gregor was a popular pupil, well known and liked by staff and pupils. He will be a huge loss to us all.’ Mr Allan added: ‘We have also set aside some quiet space in the school for pupils and staff, who are being comforted by our own staff and a Fife Council support team.’ The school is liaising with Fife’s public health team and all pupils have been given leaflets highlighting the symptoms of meningitis. However, it is thought to be very unlikely that any other pupils will contract the illness. Gregor’s devastated parents, Jenny and George Smith, are now planning his funeral. His friends at Kirkcaldy High School are organising a sponsored walk to raise money for research into meningitis. Meningitis can kill in four hours. Classic symptoms include a headache, stiff neck and a dislike of bright light. Some suffers develop a rash that does not fade under pressure. To carry out the 'glass test' on a rash roll a clear glass over the affected area - if it does not fade seek immediate medical attention. Each year around 3,400 people contract bacterial meningitis and septicaemia (the blood poisoning form of the disease). Septicaemia symptoms include cold hands and feet, and the rash. 1 in 10 people die and 1 in 4 are left with permanent disabilities such as loss of limbs, scarring, loss of hearing or brain damage. Under-5s, those aged 14-24 and the elderly are most at risk.","Gregor Smith, 13, died from killer brain disease hours after symptoms arose .

An eight-year-old boy suffering from an inoperable brain tumor has raised more than $40,000 so that he can bring smiles to other sick children by giving them toys. Just a week ago, Matthew Jacko, who is home on hospice care in Monroeville, Pennsylvania, told his family he wanted to give a gift to every child at Children's Hospital, where he had previously stayed. With the help of his family, he asked the public to help him raise money through a website to buy each a stuffed toy monkey, which cost $20 each - and the response was overwhelming. Within 12 hours, they reached their goal of 500 monkeys and just days later, they had enough donations for 1,000 toys - and the amount still continues to grow. Kindness: Eight-year-old Matthew Jacko, who has an inoperable brain tumor, has given more than a 1,000 stuffed monkey toys to sick children in hospital after raising money so that they would smile . The little boy has now hand-delivered some of the monkeys to the Children's Hospital and extra toys were sent to the Children’s Institute, the Ronald McDonald House and Forbes pediatric unit. On footage by WTAE, Matthew is pushed into the children's rooms on a wheelchair before handing over the monkeys and softly wishing them to feel better soon. 'I hope this makes you smile,' he can be heard telling the children. He told the news station that he just wanted to bring smiles to other children as 'laughter is the best thing in the whole world'. The visit came 18 months after Matthew's parents took him to Children's Hospital, noticing he wasn't running normally in basketball and had began to slur his speech. Generous: He is pictured handing over one of the toys to a patient at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh . Impressive: The family has received more than $40,000 in donations to help them buy the toy monkeys . Within 12 hours of his arrival, they learned that he had a brain tumor. They do not know how much longer they have with him - but continue to be inspired by his strength and compassion for others. 'He never complains, never questions, he just does whatever [the doctors] want him to do,' said his mother, Carey. During the visit to the hospital this weekend, Matthew and his parents were joined by his sister Jocelyn, his uncle Patrick and friends including Lisa Donnelly, who had started the donation process. All the friends and family members involved said they were stunned by the response. 'I don't know if it has completely sunk in yet either, the response has been overwhelming,' Carey said. 'Awesome': Matthew also met his favorite Pittsburgh Penguins player, Sidney Crosby, last week . Fighter: Matthew's family said the boy, pictured with his sister, has never complained about his treatment . Struggle: He was diagnosed after his parents noticed he was slurring. He is now at home for hospice care . 'I would like to thank the community for all their efforts and everybody around the nation that has donated. I mean it's not just in Pittsburgh. This goes all around the country,' his dad, Brian, added. Matthews parents, who have both taken time off work to care for their son, said the care does not just extend to the donations, but to the daily support they receive - such as cooked meals from friends. It's not the only excitement little Matthew has enjoyed this week. His hockey team, the Pittsburgh Penguins welcomed him to a game this week and he got a chance to meet Sidney Crosby, his favorite player. He simply described the experience as 'awesome'.","Matthew Jacko, from Monroeville, Pennsylvania, was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumor 18 months ago and is now home on hospice care .

But his apology left fans claiming it was another example of the BBC’s obsession with political correctness. 'Sorry': The former Liverpool and England striker apologised live on air after his 'sexist' statement . During the game, Chelsea striker Fernando Torres and Tottenham defender Jan Vertonghen had been involved in a series of clashes. Fowler said: ‘Torres and Vertonghen were at each other’s throats all game, like a couple of girls – pulling each other’s shirts and pushing each other.’ Less than half an hour later, Fowler apologised on the live BBC1 show. ‘I made a comment about women’s football. I do apologise,’ he said. ‘I’m a big, big fan of Liverpool Ladies actually, who have a chance of winning the league tomorrow. I’ll be watching that. 'Anyone at home who was offended – I’m deeply sorry. I hope that’s the end of that.’ Within minutes, football fans used Twitter and online forums to criticise the decision to issue an apology. Owen .

"By . Associated Press Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 15:02 EST, 5 November 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:16 EST, 5 November 2013 . A newlywed and father-to-be who became paralyzed from the waist down after falling from a tree told his family to switch the life support machine off so he could die - just one day after the accident, it emerged today. Tim Bowers, 32, from Indiana loved the outdoors. He fished, camped and helped his father on his northeastern Indiana farm, carving out time for his outdoor passions from a busy life that included a new wife, a baby on the way and a successful auto business. But it was in the woods, hunting for deer, where Bowers found time to reflect on his life and faith. 'It was just a time when he could be alone and think about things,' said his sister, Jenny Shultz, an intensive care nurse. That's where the 32-year-old was on Saturday afternoon when those quiet moments turned tragic. Victim: Tim Bowers, who fell about 16 feet from a tree and was left paralyzed from the shoulders down after a hunting accident, told his family he wanted to be taken off life support . The longtime hunter fell about 16 feet from an elevated tree stand and suffered a severe spinal injury that Shultz said left him paralyzed from the shoulders down and dependent on a ventilator to breathe. His brain wasn't affected. Tim with his sister Jenny Schultz who, as an intensive care nurse, meant she understood the severity of her brother's injuries . Confronted with the devastating prognosis, Bowers' family asked doctors at Fort Wayne's Lutheran Hospital a hard question: Could Bowers be brought out of sedation so he could be told of his condition and decide for himself whether he wanted to live or die? The doctors said yes. Tim - who has a step son - previously talked with his wife, Abbey, who he married on August 3, about never wanting to spend his life in a wheelchair, so his family knew which way it was likely to go, though it meant never seeing his unborn child. His sister - one of three - has seen this situation happen in her job. But her medical training also meant she understood the severity of her brother's injuries. His C3, C4 and C5 vertebrae were crushed. Though his brain was not injured, his body was irreparably broken. Surgery could fuse the vertebrae, but that would only allow Bowers to sit up. He would never walk or hold his baby. He might live the rest of his life in a rehabilitation hospital, relying on a machine to help him breathe. He'd never return to those outdoor activities that gave him such peace. 'We just asked him, do you want this? And he shook his head emphatically no,' Jenny Shultz said. Shultz said her brother — the youngest of four siblings — wanted to talk but couldn't because the ventilator tube was still in place. She told him that if the tube was removed, they weren't sure how long he would live. But when she asked if he wanted the tube reinserted if he was struggling, he shook his head no. Doctors asked Bowers the same questions and got the same responses. The tube came out Sunday. The last five hours of Tim Bowers' life were spent with family and friends, about 75 of whom gathered in the hospital waiting room. They prayed and sang songs. Courts have long upheld the right of patients to refuse life support. The American Medical Association says competent adults can craft directives stating they want such systems withdrawn or withheld if they suffer certain injuries or illness that leave them unable to make those decisions. But the heart-wrenching decision to remove life support is more often left to surrogates who must speak for those patients. Even when a patient has outlined his wishes for end-of-life care, the decision can tear families apart. Dr Paul Helft, director of the Charles . Warren Fairbanks Center for Medical Ethics in Indianapolis, said cases . in which the patient makes the decision usually involve a debilitating . illness like Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition that compromises the . patient's body but leaves the mind intact. Through it all, Shultz said, her brother never wavered in his decision to die. 'I just remember him saying so many times that he loved us all and that he lived a great life,' she said. 'At one point he was saying, 'I'm ready. I'm ready.'' She knows that not everyone would make the same call. But she's thankful her brother was able to make his own decision. 'No outcome was ever going to be the one that we really want, but I felt that he did it on his terms in the end,' she said. Medical ethicists say it's rare for patients to decide on the spot to be removed from life support, especially so soon after an injury. But standard medical ethics practice is to grant more autonomy to patients, and courts have upheld their rights to decide on end-of-life care. Often, patients change their minds after they've had time to meet with spiritual advisers and family, said Art Caplan, director of the medical ethics program at New York University's Langone Medical Center in New York City. Dr Paul Helft, director of the Charles Warren Fairbanks Center for Medical Ethics in Indianapolis, said cases in which the patient makes the decision usually involve a debilitating illness like Lou Gehrig's disease, a condition that compromises the patient's body but leaves the mind intact. Helft said patients have been legally and ethically permitted to make their own decision on life support for several decades now, due in part to court cases and the evolution of the practice of medicine, which places more emphasis on patients' rights. 'We give patients autonomy to make all kinds of decisions about themselves,' he said. 'We've recognized that it's important that patients have the right to self-determination.'","Tim Bowers spent his life outdoors and loved to hunt .

LIGHTING UP: MAINE PUSHES FOR LEGAL POT AND COLORADO WANTS 'WEED TAX' Voters in Colorado approved a 25 per cent tax on newly legal recreational marijuana to fund school construction.

SELLING BEER UP FOR DEBATE IN ONE OF UTAH'S LAST DRY CITIES . Utah is dealing with their own controversial move as there is a measure to sell beer in the town of Hyde Park. It is one of the largely-Mormon state's remaining dry cities, as so many of the religious residents observe Mormon law which bans the consumption of alcohol and caffeine. GAMBLING ON THE VOTE: PROPOSED CASINO CONSTRUCTION . New York voters bet big Tuesday on casino gambling as an economic energy shot, agreeing to let seven Las Vegas-style gaming palaces be built around the state, including eventually in New York City. In a measure that became a referendum on the job-creating potential and social price of gambling, a constitutional amendment allowing the casinos was approved 57 per cent to 43 per cent, with 60 percent of the vote counted. The vote was a major win for Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who proposed casinos as a way to aid the long-distressed upstate economy. The first four casinos would be built upstate, at sites to be chosen by developers. A New York City casino would be built in seven years and possibly more could be built in the suburbs, although some casino operators say the law could allow that sooner.

Washington's increase is much more dramatic as they already have the highest rate in the country at $9.19 an hour. Today's ballot proposal is pushing for the minimum wage at the Seattle airport and the surrounding hotels will be paid $15 an hour.

Three months after her affair with married Google co-founder, Sergey Brin, exploded into the public eye, company marketing manager, Amanda Rosenberg, has broken her silence online to apparently proclaim her love for the multi-billionaire. Miss Rosenberg, 27, briefly disappeared from social media when the affair which rocked the internet giant was revealed at the end of August. But now she has apparently made it very clear that the romance is still very much on, with an instagram post a few days ago featuring a scribbled ink drawing of Mr Brin alongside the caption: S x A <3 (a symbol for 'heart'). You do the math: Amanda Rosenberg's instagram post that reveals her romance with her married multi-billionaire boss at Google is still going strong, three months after it exploded into the public eye and shook the internet giant . Eyes on the prize: Google Glass marketing manager Amanda Rosenberg went from shy new employee to the co-founder's lover in the blink of an eye . Scruff: When Rosenberg posted the doodle, friends of hers commented that he was missing Google Glasses and quipped he looked like a homeless guy on teh subway - a clear reference to this famous picture . The less than flattering image of the Mr Brin drew comments from her friends. One joked, 'You forgot the Glass,' - a reference to the Google Glasses which Miss Rosenberg is tasked with marketing. Another noted, 'Looks like a homeless guy I saw on the subway,' a nod to the now infamous picture of the wealthy Mr Brin sitting on a New York subway train. When their affair was exposed at the . end of August a spokesperson for Mr Brin was forced to reveal  that the . 40-year-old – whose fortune stands at $23billion – has been living . separately from his wife, mother of their two children, Anne Wocjcicki . for several months. They are not legally separated and, according to their spokesman,’ they remain good friends and partners.’ Earlier this year Miss Rosenberg was photographed alongside Mr Brin at New York Fashion Week and it is not known how long the couple have been dating. Miss Rosenberg stopped tweeting just days before her romance with her boss was revealed and has been uncharacteristically quiet online until the last few weeks. Now British Miss Rosenberg – who attended $48,000 a year Marlborough College, the same school as the Duchess of Cambridge – is back online and has posted a string of flamboyant and bizarrely intimate tweets over the past month. Her return to the Twittersphere includes such tweets as one posted on 27 October when she tweeted: ‘It’s that time of month when Tampax sends my vagina into space.’ Elsewhere she poked fun at a book cover featuring a girl, legs aloft sitting next to a faceless stranger. 'Certain girls unabashedly break wind at uncertain girls: A novel,' she tweeted. California dreamin': Amanda wrote on her blog that she was initially so shy in her new role in Google's Silicon Valley HQ she failed to turn up at her first work drinks invitation, fearing she would be 'the weird loner in the corner' Three's a crowd? Rosenberg with boss Brin and fashion designer Diane von Furstenberg in New York . Happily separated: When news of Brin's affair with Miss Rosenberg broke a spokesman for the the internet boss was forced to reveal that he had been living apart from Anne Wojckicki, the mother of his two children, for several months . And in another from 22 October when she joked: ‘Wedged between 2 kids’ car seats. Now have soggy Cheerios stuck in sexy places.’ Questions were raised as to whether Miss Rosenberg’s affair with her married boss was a breach of the company’s own code of conduct. It reads: ‘Romantic relationships with co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. ‘When faced with a potential conflict of interest, ask yourself: would this activity harm my reputation, negatively impact my ability to do my job at Google or potentially harm Google? ‘Would this activity embarrass Google or me if it showed up on the front page of a newspaper of a blog? If the answer to any of these questions if “yes”, the relationship of situation is likely to create a conflict of interest and you should avoid it.’ Until news of their affair broke the most controversial element in Miss Rosenberg’s life were the computerized Google Glasses she is charged with marketing. She has been credited with coming up with the ‘Ok, Glass’ command for the Google Glass.

A former Black Panther, who hijacked a plane and forced it to fly to Cuba, is set to return to the U.S. to face justice today. William Potts said he is homesick and wants to return to America for the first time in almost three decades. Mr Potts, 56, who has been working with U.S. diplomats in Havana in recent weeks to get a passport, said they told him yesterday that his travel arrangements were made . and he could leave on a charter flight to Miami today. Scroll down for video . William Potts is due to return to the U.S. today for the first time since he hijacked a plane in 1984 and forced it to take him to Cuba where he has lived since . Mr Potts has worked with U.S. diplomats in Havana to secure a passport and return to Miami . Because the two countries have no extradition treaty, Mr Potts was beyond the reach of U.S. justice but he still faces an indictment for air piracy that could carry a 20-year prison sentence. He hopes the 13 years he served in Cuba for the hijacking will be taken into consideration by U.S. authorities but admits he may be sent to prison. Mr Potts said he seeks 'closure' by . facing the U.S. justice system. He argues that the time he served in the . Combinado del Este prison outside Havana should mitigate further . punishment back home. 'I'm . ready for whatever,' Potts said. 'My position is, of course, I did the . crime and I did the time, and the United States has to recognize that.' Mr Potts was jailed after hijacking a commercial plane in 1984 when he pulled a gun hidden in a plaster cast and forced it to land in Cuba, where he expected authorities to offer him guerrilla training. Instead he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Since his release, he settled down became a farmer and had two daughters with his second wife. Revolutionary Times: Armed members of the Black Panther Party leave the Capitol in Sacramento May 2nd, 1967 . He was granted permanent . residency in Cuba and he and his now ex-wife live in a modest Soviet-style . apartment block east of Havana. Mr Potts said: 'I've got kind of mixed emotions, let me say that at least, about touching American soil for the first time in nearly 30 years. 'So much has changed, and I'm just going to have to wait and see what it looks like when I get there.' The Black Panther Party was a revolutionary organization in the U.S. calling for empowerment of African Americans and protection from police brutality. Set up in 1966, the leaders of the group backed socialist and Marxist doctrines and eventually had affiliations with Communist Cuba. The organization created a Ten-Point Program that cemented its economic and political grievances and the party gained national prominence during the rest of the 1960s and 1970s. The party was officially disbanded in the early 1980s. Notable Black Panther members fled to Cuba, including Assata Shakur - the aunt of murdered rapper Tupac Shakur. She was accused of murdering two New Jersey State Troopers in 1973 and indited in relation to other crimes including attempted murder and armed robbery. She escaped from prison in 1979 and has been living in Cuba in political asylum since 1984. He said his understanding was that he would be escorted by U.S. officials and delivered into the custody of U.S. marshals on arrival in Florida. 'What happens after that I couldn't tell you,' he said. 'I hope to be arraigned soon.' In the 1960s and early '70s, there were dozens of American hijackings to Cuba. As a way of discouraging them, both sides signed a 1971 agreement under which each government agreed to prosecute hijackers or return them to the other country. The U.S. has limited travel to Cuba since 1960 when Fidel Castro came to power. The rules were amended in 2011 to allow all Americans to visit Cuba but direct flights by U.S. airlines are still illegal. It is unclear what stance U.S. authorities will take against Mr Potts as the U.S. Interests Section, FBI and Cuban officials did not have any comment on his case. U.S. authorities have aggressively prosecuted some returning fugitives, while others saw their sentences reduced significantly for time served elsewhere. Even though Potts intends to continue to call Cuba home for the foreseeable future, he decided to return to the U.S. and take his chances with the legal system. The pending case against him keeps him from living his life fully, he said. He said: 'It's time it had closure. Why leave it hanging, why leave this gaping uncertainty? 'So I want to resolve that because... having completed my sentence, I feel like I want to put all that stuff behind me. 'I don't want that lingering over or impeding anything I might want to do. Once you've paid your debt to society you're entitled to a fresh start.'","William Potts, 56, is due to land in Florida today for the first time in 30 years .

Leaving home has always been an important milestone in a person's life and a sign that an individual has entered adulthood. But now a new life stage called 'emerging adulthood' has been coined to cope with the trend for young people flying the nest later in life. The reasons for 'emerging adults' staying at home includes a diminishing number of blue-collar jobs, expensive housing and an increasing need for extended studies, but scientists believe the phenomenon means people in their twenties are experiencing an extended period of youth. Research by Concordia's Department of Applied Human Sciences, Canada, said moving out can constitute a 'crisis' for young adults but parents are best placed to provide practical help (pictured) as well as emotional support and a financial safety net . Just over 42 per cent of adults aged 20 to 29 still lived with their parents in 2011, according to a census from Statistics Canada, compared to 32 per cent ten years earlier and 27 per cent in 1981. People in their early 20s are now labeled as millennials who are experiencing 'emerging adulthood' - a new life stage that has not affected previous generations, Science Daily reported. Research by Concordia's Department of Applied Human Sciences in Montreal, Canada, said that moving out can constitute a 'crisis' for young adults and that friends and family play different roles. The reasons for 'emerging adults' staying at home includes a diminishing number of blue-collar jobs, expensive housing and an increasing need for extended studies, but scientists beleive the phenomenon means people in their twenties are experiencing an extended period of youth . A recent report from the Office for National Statistics found that the number of married couples living ‘without dependent children’ has risen by 200,000 since 2003.Although this includes childless couples, the ONS said the increase is due to the growth in homes  with adult children, who are too old to be classed as ‘dependent’.This means they are over 18, or 16 if no longer in full-time education. One in every 100 homes now has two families, the report found, largely because grown-up sons or daughters who stay with their parents are bringing partners in to live with them.The analysis also said an increasing number of single parents are finding their adult children reluctant to leave home.While more young people crowd in with their parents, the Families and Households report found a rise in middle-aged people living alone.Around 7.7million people now live by themselves and single-person households aged between 45 and 64 have risen by more than a quarter in the past decade. Professor Varda Mann-Feder, at the university and author of the study in the Canadian Journal of Family and Youth, conducted interviews with 32 'emerging adults' who had left home, or were planning to fly the nest. The young adults who had already left home, said their parents played an integral role to their successful move as they provided pragmatic help as well as emotional support and a financial safety net. However, she stressed that friends were just as important to a successful outcome as participants in the study revealed they preferred asking their friends for tips in living autonomously, rather than their parents. 'Emerging adults' still living at home, were 'extremely influenced' by friends and family in relation to their thoughts about leaving home, the study said. Individuals hoping to move out unsurprisingly talked to their friends who had already made the big move about going it alone and whether it is a good idea. Parents were  reassured by the ability of their children to tap into theses sources of information and thought it helped prevent their offspring making mistakes. Professor Mann Felder said: 'This study shows peers continue to play a critical role in development after the teenage years.' 'They provide unique input not available from parents or romantic partners,' she added.","The new life stage has been coined to cope with the trend for 20 to 29-year-olds leaving home later in life as the cost of living rises .

A 21-year-old Florida college student, Joshua Sekulic, is charged of sexual assault against two women and battery charges against a third who managed to escape his biting grip. The junior at Florida Gulf Coast University wrote 'apology' letters to two of his alleged rape victims and claimed that he didn't know they didn't want to have sex.Sekulic was arrested on Monday after two FGCU students told campus security that they were raped. Another female student told campus police that she was physically assaulted.The International Business Times reports that Two of the victim's stories claim that Sekulic raped them not once, but twice after he'd demanded sex and they'd said no. Both alleged rapes took place at the victims' apartments. The third victim managed to escape from Sekulic after she asked him to leave and he pinned her down on her bed and bit her. Once she freed herself, Sekulic left her residence. WINK news reported that one of the letters to Sekulic's victims states that an invitation inside her apartment led him to conclude that she wanted to have sex.

A cat named Elliot was found alive after being impaled with an arrow and now animal control is searching for the person who used him as target practice. The mayor of Norwich, Connecticut found Elliot on a porch near the animal's home while campaigning on Monday. 'I was angry. I wanted to hit someone,' Mayor Peter Nystrom told The Bulletin. Scroll down for video . Gruesome discovery: Elliot the cat was found on Monday impaled by an arrow and animal control believes he was used as target practice . Survivor: Elliot was found on a porch near his owner's home on Monday by Peter Nystrom (right) - the mayor of Norwich, Connecticut - who was out campaigning . Retribution: Mayor Nystrom says he was so angry after finding the cat, that he wanted to hit someone. He ended up helping Elliot's owner pay for veterinarian bills to remove the arrow . Mr Nystrom called police and Elliot was taken to All Friends Animal Hospital where veterinarian Kathleen Tangari performed surgery to remove the arrow lodged in the cat's upper torso. She says Elliot survived because the tissue hardened around the entry and exit points which prevented him from bleeding to death. It also didn't puncture any vital organs. 'It completely missed the jugular, the lungs, the heart, and both bones on each side,' Dr Tangari told WTNH. 'It's unbelievable.' Miracle kitty: Lucky for Elliot, no major organs were hit and veterinarian Kathleen Tangari (right) was able to completely remove the arrow. Elliot is recovering fine and should be able to go home by the end of this week . 'It's a miracle that arrow missed everything inside of him. That cat was meant to survive, as far as I'm concerned,' Mayor Nystrom said. Dr Tangari estimates that Elliot was shot two days before being found and was sitting at the time of the attack.  The arrow's position within Elliot's body meant that the cat couldn't curl up at night to keep warm. Luckily, Dr Tangari was able to completely remove the arrow and Elliot is recovering though he may have sustained some permanent nerve damage. Back in action: Elliot may have sustained some long-term nerve damage, but he is able to walk again . Despite being the target of a cruel human act, the cat is still friendly towards people. 'He didn't once try to bite or act vicious. And I wouldn't have blamed him. He's been in a lot of pain,' hospital co-owner Lona Harelle told WFSB. Ms Harelle said that Elliot should be able to go home to his owner, Marian Mann, by the end of this week. Still friendly: Hospital workers are surprised the cat is still playful around humans after being targeted in such a cruel attack . Ms Mann, who is elderly, wasn't able to afford Elliot's medical bills so Mayor Nystrom stepped in to pay for them. Authorities believe that the cat was used as target practice judging by the type of arrow used. 'Somebody did this intentionally,' Animal Control Officer Michele Kellough told The Hartford Courant. 'It's not like a gun; an arrow does not go off by itself.' Animal Control is currently investigating and hoping to catch the person or people responsible. Residents in the area where the cat was found told The Bulletin that dozens of local cats have gone missing in the past two weeks to a month, but no others have been found with arrow wounds.

Standing at over 10ft tall this stunning sculpture of a fairy palace takes the art of making sand castles to a new level. It was built by professional sand sculptor Matt Long, who is paid as much as $70,000 for one of his creations. Mr Long has made his living building sand castles for the past 12 years and has made elaborate sculptures for clients such as Rockefeller Plaza in New York, Ringling Brothers, and Nickelodeon. Fairy palace: This stunning sculpture in New York was created by professional sand castle modeller Matt Long . Master at work: Mr Long has made his living from sand castles for the past 12 years and is paid up to $70,000 for one of his creations . Sailing away: A pirate ship sculpture created for the South Street Sea Port Museum in 2011 in New York City . The 58-year-old from Staten Island, New York, said: 'I started creating sand sculptures with my kids about 18 years ago while we were on vacation. 'I saw someone create something in the sand, and I thought, ""gee, I can do this."" 'These days I don't really create sand castles - what I do is make people smile and that's become it for me.' His work has taken him across the world where he builds sculptures for private parties, events and corporations. The fairy palace features a staircase wrapping around a high tower supported by intricate arches - made only of sand and water. It is so detailed, individual 'bricks' are visible and passersby can see every tiny window. Mr Long, who has placed in world championship sand sculpting competitions, was built to showcase his talents. Amazing feat: An intricate design entered for competition in Florida with partner Kirk Radamaker. Mr Long began creating sand castles 18 years ago while on vacation with his children . Memorial: This sculpture was created for a fundraiser in memory of firefighter Stephen Siller who died in the 9/11 attacks . Open mind: A competition piece submitted by Mr Long. His sand castle creations have taken him across the world for work with private companies and corporations . Medal winner: Mr Long came third at the World Championships in June with this piece. He sprays glue with water on his sculptures to preserve them . His most expensive sculpture cost almost $71,000 (£44,000) and was constructed over five days using 200 tons of sand. Mr Long said there is a process to follow goes each sculpture that starts with a base pile of wet sand. He said: 'You carve from the top down as you go, if you don't follow these steps you will be starting over. 'The quality of the sand is very important - it should to be fine and have an angular grain structure.' To preserve sculptures, he mixes water-based glue with water and sprays it on top of the sculpture. The sand sculptures can stand for up to four months when coated with the mixture - and even withstood a hurricane. Professional: Mr Long sets to work creating a fairy sand castle on the beach at Coney Island, New York, to showcase his skills . Attached: Mr Long said at first he found it very difficult to let go of his sculptures, which only last about four months, but has got used it . Passionate: The sculptor said his work is not about creating sand castles but 'what I do is make people smile and that's become it for me' Fans: A passerby stops to have his photograph taken with a sand castle Mr Long built on Coney Island beach . Mr Long said: 'I put 13 gallons of fixative onto our 16ft, 65 ton sand sculpture, and Hurricane Irene didn't touch it. It stood the entire rainfall.' But the beautiful works of art eventually disappear over time, and he says that he cannot get attached to the sculptures. The sculptor said: 'When I first started, it was far more difficult to let go of a sculpture, but I guess you just get used to it. 'The art of sculpting sand is a very temporal form - I think what you're attached to is the performance of the work.' Mr Long will be sculpting at Comic-con in New York this year, and will be participating in a contest in November in Siesta Key, Florida.","Professional sand modeller Matt Long gets paid up to $70,000 for one of his intricate sculptures .

A health and safety expert knocked a teenage girl off her moped before speeding off, leaving her in the road to be run over and killed by an oncoming minibus, a court heard today. Jade Clark's scooter was 'swallowed up and fragmented into hundreds of pieces' by Brian Hampton's Volvo 4X4 after he ploughed into the back of it. The executive swerved around the 16-year-old after she was flung into a Hampshire dual carriageway, before she was hit by a Volkswagen minibus whose driver had no time to react. Hampton, 58, an engineer who checks the safety of signals on Britain's railways, fled the scene and then tried to cover up his part in the teenager's death, the prosecution say. Road death: Jade Clark. 16, was killed after Brian Hampton, sketched in court, hit her with his 4X4 before she was run over and killed by a minibus, a court heard . Debris: The shattered remains of Jade's moped after a crash the prosecution say was caused by Hampton who then fled . Bournemouth Crown Court heard Hampton, who was already banned from driving, told his wife, his employers, a car garage and the police his £40,000 Volvo had struck a deer. Hampton paid £4,300 for the damage to the front of his vehicle to be hastily repaired, a jury was told. The court heard Hampton struck Jade's scooter as he drove along the A31 in Ringwood, Hampshire, on February 24. Crash scene: Police investigators look at the duel carriageway near Ringwood, Hampshire, after a smash that claimed the like of 16-year-old Jade . Chain of events: Jade was knocked into the road and died instantly from severe head injuries when a minibus followed . Simon Jones, prosecuting, said: 'Jade fell into the middle of the carriageway and the defendant swerved around her. That left her exposed to the fast moving traffic. 'Her moped was swallowed up and pushed along the carriageway.' Mr Jones said motorist John Ward was driving a VW minibus and had no time to react before hitting Jade, a trainee hairdresser from Ringwood in the New Forest. He added: 'He drove over what he initially believed to be debris and caused catastrophic head injuries and instant death. 'The moped was fragmented into hundreds of pieces. 'Brian Hampton had already driven off effectively leaving Jade and the scene of a fatal road collision. 'It was his duty to stop. 'What the defendant did was to seek to evade justice and pervert the course of justice by arranging for the damage to his vehicle to be subsequently repaired. 'He did this with one purpose in mind - that being to ensure there could be no link between him, his vehicle and the collision that occurred on the A31 that day.' Case: Brian Hampton is on trial for perverting the course of justice after allegedly lying to cover up his part in the crash . Hampton drove his damaged vehicle to the Premier Inn in Poole where he had been booked in by his employers, railway company Signalling Solutions, the court heard. He emailed his manager at 4am the following day saying he couldn't attend work because he had swollen feet. He then told his wife Maureen that his car had broken down and he had to wait several days for a recovery truck to tow it back to his home in Kent, it is alleged. But later that day he secretly drove to Ashford near his home town of Shadoxhurst where he took his car to a garage then stayed in a nearby Holiday Inn for two nights, the jury heard. Hampton is said to have told the body shop he had hit a deer, then spent £4,300 getting the Volvo fixed. Tributes: The flowers left for Jade Clark at Ringwood Fire station, close to the scene of the crash . Terrible: Trainee hairdresser jade was sent flying into the middle of the dual carriageway, where she was killed . Grief: Jade Clark's mother Sharon Clark is comforted by her husband Daniel Clark during a press conference at the time of her death . Mechanics replaced the car's bonnet, grill, radiator, sump shield, bumper and number plate but raised concerns because there had been no blood or fur on the car. When officers swooped on his home on March 21, Hampton told them he had no idea why he was being arrested. He told police that on the night Jade died he had been visiting his daughter in Poole but had arrived too late so had bought fish and chips then booked into a hotel. He said no incidents had taken place and he had not had any repair work done to his car. In a second interview he conceded the car had been repaired but said he had no clue as to how the damage had occurred. Mr Jones said a series of CCTV images of Hampton's car prior to the incident showed the grill trim in tact, while photos taken after showed it damaged. Incident: Hampton drove a Silver Volvo XC 90 like this one, and then paid £4,300 to get it repaired, jury hears . Hampton was also caught on camera checking the front of his vehicle at the Premier Inn in Poole, and told staff when he left that he couldn't get the bonnet open. Mr Jones said: 'There can be no other credible explanation for the repair other than for this defendant to distance himself from the collision and subsequent detection of his involvement.' Hampton previously pleaded guilty to separate charges of causing death by careless driving, driving while disqualified and without insurance on February 24 and 25, the jury was told. He denies the charge of perverting the course of justice by arranging for the repair of the collision damage, failing to stop at the scene of an accident and failing to report an accident. The trial at Bournemouth Crown Court continues. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Jade Clark was hit by Brian Hampton's 4X4 before he fled, court told .

He was being punished by a Mexican gang for his refusal to pay extortion fees from his successful catering business in Chihuahua. Four men forced him into the back of his vehicle at a local park in the northern Mexico city before slicing just under his knees. Gutierrez spent two weeks in critical condition. As soon as he was able, he sought asylum in Texas. Now, Gutierrez, 35, is facing long odds on getting approval to stay in the US. The US government allows asylum for those who have credible fear of persecution based on their race, religion, national origin, political status or membership in a particular social group. Cyclist Carlos Gutierrez, right, a double amputee, rides his bike in San Antonio. Gutierrez, a Mexican asylum seeker who fled to the U.S. after extortionists cut his legs off for not paying the extortion fees, is riding his bike from El Paso to Austin, Texas, to raise awareness on the situation of political asylum seekers. But Mexican asylum seekers have struggled to convince U.S. courts they fit in any of these categories, with approval rates running 1 to 2 percent. By contrast, more than a fourth of immigrants from other Latin American countries such as Colombia and Venezuela were granted asylum last year. Many can cite ethnic or political grounds. Gutierrez has been working to raise awareness and call attention to his plight and to the thousands of other Mexicans who seek asylum in the U.S. each year from drug cartel violence, with little success. He's getting stranger's attention by riding his bicycle through Texas using his prosthetic legs and talking to everyone he meets. 'If someone from Cuba or from Venezuela can get asylum, why not someone from Mexico?' said Gutierrez, who spent nearly two weeks on his 800-mile bicycle trek from El Paso to Austin,Texas. Since he hopped on his bicycle in El Paso on Oct. 28, Gutierrez has been making his case for a change in the system. Along the way townspeople came out from shops and houses to wave and talk with him during rest stops. He endured rain, strong winds, flat tires and fatigue. On the fifth day, a prosthetic specialist met him to adjust his legs because he was bruising and blistering. 'There were times when we thought it'd be best to have him rest, to drive him to the next town to let his legs recover, but he'd say, `No,' said Jaqueline Armendariz, a member of the support team for the ride to Austin. 'He has a mission.' Gutierrez said he never considered quitting. Cyclist Carlos Gutierrez, a double amputee, center, stands with his bike during a stop at the Mexican Consulate in San Antonio, Texas. Gutierrez, fled to the US after a Mexican gang cut his legs off for not paying extortion fees. It doesn't matter, he said, 'how grave your wound was. What matters is that you get up. I have no legs, but I am on my feet.' The US Executive Office for Immigration Review did not specifically comment on Gutierrez's case. However, immigration judges have acknowledged in court that asylum cases based on fear of crime or violence are difficult to make. 'I believe everything you just told me,' immigration Judge Stephen Ruhle told a Mexican applicant at a recent hearing in which the man described being targeted by corrupt police officers for extortion money. 'But asylum is not applicable to cases like yours.' Double ampute, Carlos Gutierrez, left, gets a hug from a supporter during a stop at the Mexican Consulate in San Antonio. Gutierrez is riding his bike from El Paso to Austin, Texas, to raise awareness on the situation of political asylum seekers. Some scholars have argued that many applicants should qualify under a looser definition of 'social group.' A 2010 report by the United Nations' High Commissioner for Refugees said people who, on principle, refuse to pay extortion could be considered a group. Other experts say the threats to individuals have evolved since asylum categories were defined in treaties after World War II. 'Now, people are fleeing different forms of persecution,' said Karen Musalo, director of the Center for . Philip Schrag, a professor of public interest law at George Washington University, said many applications come from Mexicans who have been apprehended crossing illegally into the US .

'Many come seeking employment but are not threatened,' he said. Gutierrez has worked in a burrito shop to help support his wife and children while his case goes through the system. He said he has put his life in Chihuahua behind him. 'I'd rather think about the future,' he said.","Carlos Gutierrez's legs were sawed off in the back of his car by a Mexican gang .

A ten-year-old boy has been given a new ear by doctors who built the organ from scratch using one of his ribs. Alfie Hazell was born with an ear lobe but no ear structure or canal on his left side. This was due to him suffering hemifacial microsomia - a congenital disorder that . affects the development of the lower half of the face, most commonly the . ears and mouth. Alfie Hazell, 10, was given a new left ear (pictured) by surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital who made it out of one of his ribs. They used skin grafts to cover the new ear structure . It can occur on just one side of the face or one both and can cause problems with breathing. It is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts. Now, surgeons at Great Ormond Street Hospital have built Alfie a brand new ear. His mother, Catherine, 41, said the amazing procedure has transformed her son’s life. She said: ‘Alfie has been so brave, and we’re so proud of him. The new ear means that Alfie won’t have to deal with people staring any more. Alfie was born with hemifacial microsomia - a congenital disorder that affects the development of the lower half of the face. It meant he had a left ear lobe but no outer ear or ear canal . 'He has coped . with people making comments about his appearance all his life. Ever . since he was small he hid behind our legs when he met new people, and . always hid his left side. ‘When he was three, a group of older boys surrounded us while we were on a train and pointed and laughed at him. ‘Even . though he was very young, the experience affected Alfie for years . afterwards, it was deeply traumatic and really set his confidence back a . long way. ‘When Alfie . was five, a girl told him his appearance made her feel sick. Those are . the sorts of reactions that he had to get used to. He had to do a lot of . growing up in a short space of time. Alfie (pictured as a baby) was told he had to wait until he was nine-years-old before he could have the procedure as his ribs needed to mature sufficiently . Alfie's mother, Catherine (pictured with Alfie and his brothers, Joseph and Toby), said: 'Alfie has been so brave, and we're so proud of him. The new ear means that Alfie won't have to deal with people staring any more' Mrs Hazell, a . childminder, and her husband Ben, 40, a business development manager, . were keen to give Alfie the power to decide the course of his . life-changing treatment. Doctors . had advised the family, of Harpenden, Hertfordshire, that Alfie needed . to wait until he was nine-years-old before they could operate to allow . enough time for his ribcage to develop. ‘Some people with Alfie’s condition . choose not to have reconstructive surgery. The staff at Great Ormond . Street said our options were to do nothing, to fit a prosthetic or to . have a rib graft. Alfie was too scared to look at his new ear until he was in the car going home from the hospital . He had to have a skin graft taken from his head (pictured) to cover and support the new ear . ‘I . was keen that Alfie was able to make the decision himself. Ben and I . encouraged him to speak to consultants directly during appointments, as . if he was one of the adults.’ In April 2011, Alfie decided that he wanted to go ahead with the rib graft procedure which would involve two operations. The first operation, which involved putting the newly shaped rib bone into place, was carried out a year later. The . procedure involved a section of bone and cartilage from one of Alfie’s . ribs being used to build the missing ear structure. Skin grafts were . then applied to cover the bone. Alfie was so happy when he first saw his new ear that he took a photo of it on his phone and sent it to all of his friends and family . Alfie . has been deaf on his left side since birth and although the new ear . does not allow him to hear, he will have the option to implant a hearing aid later in life. Then, in March 2013, the final procedure to fill out the ear structure using skin grafts was successfully completed. Mrs Hazell said: ‘When they took the bandage off, Alfie was so nervous that he didn’t want to look at the left side of his face at first. ‘It . was only when we were in the car going home from the hospital that he . felt brave enough to take a picture of his new ear and look at it. ‘He was so happy when he saw what it looked like - he sent pictures to everyone to show off.’ It is possible that Alfie will require further surgery in the future to correct the alignment of his jaw and teeth. It is possible that Alfie (pictured with his new ear) will require further surgery in the future to correct the alignment of his jaw and teeth . Mr and Mrs Hazell have been given support throughout Alfie’s journey by charities Changing Faces and Microtia Mingle. Alfie’s brothers, five-year-old Joseph, and Toby, nine, have been drafted in to look out for their big brother through the lengthy healing process. Mrs Hazell said: ‘We had to explain to the boys that they need to be careful during rough-and-tumble games. If Alfie damages his ear there could be an infection or it might need to be rebuilt, so we have to be careful. ‘He’s also had to sit out of PE at school, but he’s been very understanding about the situation.’ Hemifacial microsomia is the second most common facial birth defect after clefts. Children with the condition have a small or underdeveloped part of the face - usually the ear or jaw. The underdevelopment of the face can lead to feeding, speech and breathing problems. The condition can also result in hearing and sight loss. It is not known what causes it but it is believed to develop in the early stages of pregnancy. It is not clear exactly how many people the condition affects but it could be as many as one in 5,600. It is more common in men than women.

A UK police force has become the first in the country to offer pensions for retired police dogs. Crime-fighting canines will be rewarded with up to £1,500 each under the Nottinghamshire Police scheme. Previously, ex-police dogs received no contributions towards their upkeep and would be kept by their handlers as pets or rehomed. A new scheme in Nottinghamshire will pay up to £1,500 for each retired . police dog's costs, because they are usually taken on by their handlers as . pets . The payouts will cover treatments for the highly-trained animals, including vet’s bills, worming, vaccinations and kennel fees. Notts. Police say they will pay a maximum of £500 per year for three years to cover the upkeep of retired animals. However the plans, which will be rolled out next month, have met with criticism from campaigners who say the money, which will total around £39,000 for the force’s 26 police dogs, is a rough deal for taxpayers. Six dogs retire from the police force every year after a career sniffing out drugs, bombs and searching properties . Asked what he made of such comments, Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Notts. Police, said: 'I guess the criticism is, ""well hang on a minute, we should spend the money elsewhere"". Well, you’ve got to make judgments about priorities.' He added: 'We look after the people who work for us who have been police officers and staff - they get a decent retirement and I think it’s important the same is done for the dogs. 'These animals work hard for the police and they are officers in their own right. 'Many of the force’s dogs are fit and healthy when they retire but some need medical treatment for injury or illness resulting from being worked hard while tackling crime. 'These dogs give willing and sterling service over the years in protecting the public so I am delighted to approve a scheme that will ensure continuing medical help once their work is done.' Handler PC Matt Rogers believes his dog Rossi may have saved his life in a terrifying incident last November. The eight-year-old Belgian shepherd/malinois cross leapt 8ft into the air to grab an axe from the hand of a man as PC Rogers tried to arrest him in Boughton. Rossi is expected to retire in the next 12 months or so after spending most of his life working for Notts Police and helping to make 'many hundreds' of arrests. PC Rogers said: 'I’m really pleased and I think it’s only right. As an organisation that works with animals we need to set an example. Paddy Tipping, Police and Crime Commissioner for Notts. Police, said he was 'concerned to learn' dog pensions weren't already being offered . 'With Rossi by my side while I’m tackling a suspect I almost can’t miss. I love him to bits, he looks after me.' Around six police dogs retire every year after spending their lives assisting with arrests, crowd control, sniffing out drugs and searching properties. Mr Tipping said: 'Let’s be clear about it, if the officers didn’t look after the dogs when they retire from the force they would be put down. 'The police officers have become very fond of the dogs, they keep the dogs, and I don’t think it’s fair that they have to pay all the bills.' Notts Police is the first force to offer an ‘in-house’ pension scheme for its retired canine officers. In 2009, Cambridgeshire Police announced it had set up a trust to fund a similar retirement plan for its dogs.","The £39,000 scheme is being introduced by Nottinghamshire Police .

Hospital staff are being bribed to work more hours amid fears the NHS faces its worst-ever winter. Nurses, physiotherapists and other health workers are being offered bonuses of up to £65 – on top of their overtime pay – if they work longer shifts. The measures have been brought in amid concern that A&E units are facing a ‘toxic’ combination of staff shortages and a steady rise in sicker, frailer patients. The Great Western Hospital in Swindon, Wiltshire, is paying staff a £65 reward every time they work overtime in a desperate bid to overcome the winter crisis . Yesterday the NHS’s medical director . Professor Sir Bruce Keogh admitted that there were already signs this . winter would be worse than previous years. He told Radio 4’s Today . programme: ‘Winter is going to be a particular issue. We have to address . the problems coming up this winter and we have to address the . longer-term problem.’ Sir . Bruce, who next week will publish a report setting out how A&E . services must be improved, acknowledged there was ‘a feeling that this . year is worse’ in terms of the pressures on A&E units. The . £65 payments are being offered to staff at the Great Western Hospital . in Swindon if they agree to work at least seven and a half hours . overtime. The incentive – . for all staff except doctors – is to ensure rotas are fully covered for . the expected surge in patients over the next few months. Dr . Bernadette Garrihy, of the College of Emergency Medicine which . represents A&E doctors, said: ‘We are getting ready for what may be . our worst winter yet, and we have been warning about this for a number . of months. ‘Now that we are . heading into winter, when we have got severe weather problems on the . way, increased incidence of respiratory tract infections, things like . winter vomiting bugs – we know that this puts our departments under huge . pressure.’ A&E has had a . surge in out-of-hours cases ‘because patients aren’t able to access any . other sources of care’, she said. A shortage of beds meant patients . couldn’t be moved to other wards, leading to ‘toxic overcrowding’ in . some A&E units. Government . funding to ease the pressure on A&E by paying for staff and . services was ‘far from enough’ and a ‘drop in the ocean’, she said. ‘We . are concerned about providing a safe and quality service this winter.’ It comes as senior doctors warn accident and emergency units nationally are at ¿tipping point¿ and face their worst crisis on record this winter . █ NHS bosses should not be criticised for their huge salaries, controversial NHS chief Sir David Nicholson told MPs yesterday.
