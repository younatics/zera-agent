"Snuggling up to each other in the midday sunshine, these lion cub brothers look soft enough to stroke. With their pale cream and yellow paws outstretched, George and Yame – both nearly six months old – are still small enough to be handled. Yet the pair are still recovering after suffering a terrible ordeal because of unscrupulous animal dealers who exploited their cute appearance. Survivors: Lion cubs George and Yame, who were rescued from an amusement part in Alicante, Spain . Exploitation: The pair, who are believed to have been born in a circus in France are still recovering after suffering a terrible ordeal because of unscrupulous animal dealers who exploited their cute appearance . The Terra Mitica Park, visited by thousands of Britons every year, was using the cubs for photo opportunities . They seem healthy now, but just a few months the two cubs had to be rescued from an amusement park in Benidorm, Spain, over claims they were being mistreated. The Terra Mitica Park, which is visited by thousands of British tourists every year, was using the cubs for cheap photo opportunities. Instead of being allowed to roam freely around their enclosures, George and Yame were offered up as props to holidaymakers for 10 Euros a snap. British animal lovers spearheaded a global Facebook campaign to end lion cub petting at the theme park. One visitor, Mrs Rosemary Mathews from Elstead, Surrey, said, 'I felt so sorry for them, the cubs looked really sad and shabby, they shouldn’t me used like that, its so cruel, they should be saved.' It might have seemed an innocent activity to tourists, but the lions were victims in a practice banned across most of Europe. Cooped up in miserable conditions, they were dangerously underweight and suffering serious illnesses. Now, after being brought to a sanctuary in the Spanish capital Madrid, they are ready to take on the African savannah. Friends: Yame with CJ Munoz who rescued him and has since helped to nurse him back to health in Madrid . American CJ Munoz and her Spanish husband Luis have nursed George and Yame back to health. 'We received the lions in July,' explained Mrs Munoz, who is originally from Seattle. 'They were only two months old. We had got word of the lions being at the Terra Mitica amusement park. 'There was a posting on social media of these four young men holding one of the lion cubs. 'Initially people thought these boys were volunteers; they didn’t realise they were just having their picture taken in an amusement park. They had paid 10 Euros for the picture, like other tourists there. 'The woman who arranged this had bought these cubs from France, from a circus travelling around there.' Photo opportunity: Four young men pose with one of the young lions at Terra Mitica Park in Alicante . Wretched: One of the young cubs cowers in the side of the street at the theme park which caters to tourists . Specialist officers from the Seprona squad (which stands for Special Guardia Civil Service for the Protection of Nature) impounded the lions before they were handed to Mr and Mrs Munoz. 'We called them and told them the cubs had to be rescued,' Mrs Munoz added. 'This was cruelty and exploitation. These cubs were dying. 'The woman did not have papers that proved the lions were born in captivity in Europe, so they were taken off her. She has been doing this for years apparently, but the amusement park says it is not responsible. 'There have been many lion cubs there in the past. People have posed for pictures with those lions too. 'After the rescue, we went to see them in a sanctuary in Alicante. Their condition was terrible. 'They were worn out and only being kept alive on watered-down milk. That was all they had; it meant they would never be able to grow normally. 'Vets took a look at them when we got them back to Madrid and confirmed they had metabolic bone disease. Their legs were like rubber; they couldn’t walk very far. 'They were full of viral infections and bacterial infections. They had cataracts. Neither of them could walk properly because of the sores on their feet. 'We didn’t think the smallest one, George, was going to make it. He was really suffering. For a while we seriously thought he would have to be put down humanely. In the end, because he showed such courage and tenacity, we thought this little guy deserves a chance. 'When the cubs die, the people who do this just buy more from another circus.' Sores: Both George and Yame were suffering from metabolic bone disease, leaving their legs like rubber. They were also riddled with viral and bacterial infections, plagued with cataracts, and had feet covered in sores . Road to recovery: Yame underweight and ill when he arrived at the rescue centre . Following four months of dedicated care from Mr and Mrs Munoz, the lions are approaching a suitable weight for six-month-old cubs. Yame weighs 23kg, and George is 17kg. When Yame was brought in, he weighed a pitiful 3kg, dangerously under-weight for a lion cub his age. 'We’ve addressed all the problems,' Mrs Munoz said. 'They are moving along really, really well. The little one George will probably never ever be completely right. 'George still has a bandage on him as a brace while his leg completely heals. It is stop more injury while the healing process continues. 'Yame is a lot stronger; I don’t think the abuse he went through had the same effect on him as the little one. George was used a lot more because he was smaller to start with. His little body just broke.' Fighting fit: After four months of dedicated care, a now feisty George bears his teeth . Yame and George snuggle up: George still has a bandage on his leg to support it because it has not yet healed . George snoozes: Lions do not have the same protection as tigers under international treaties on endangered species so people who keep lions in shabby conditions for exploitation cannot be prosecuted as easily . Campaign against Canned Hunting (CACH) believes cubs like George and Yame would inevitably end up being targets for hunters if kept in captivity. The despicable trade, in which lions are bred on farms to later be shot in a controlled enclosure, is most prolific in South Africa. Hundreds of rich foreigners, mostly Americans, travel to country to shoot a lion dead at close quarters just so they can pose for a picture while kneeling over their victim. Canned hunters take few risks against wild lions, but still brandish their rifles in trophy images they send back to fellow hunting fanatics back home. Mrs Munoz claims canned hunting is barely about in Europe, but takes place nevertheless. Lions do not have the same protection as tigers under the CITES international treaty on endangered species. This means people who keep lions in shabby conditions for exploitation cannot be prosecuted as easily. 'Lions will be extinct in the wild by 2025 if we don’t take urgent action,' Mrs Munoz said. For now, however, George and Yame have been saved from a sad fate so many in their species have endured.

"A man, his mother and step-father have died after they were shot during a neighbourhood dispute over farming practices at a rural Victorian property. Officers were called to the Wedderburn address, northwest of Bendigo, at 8.30pm (AEDT) on Wednesday following reports of gunshots in the area. A body was found and a four-hour siege with a 63-year-old man ensued before police found two more bodies. The victims were Peter Lockhart and his wife Mary, both in their 70s, and her 48-year-old son Greg Holmes, the Bendigo Advertiser reported. Scroll down for video . One of the properties in rural Victoria where three family members were shot dead on Wednesday night . Mr Lockhart's friend Geoff Maxwell, who knew him through their involvement in the Wedderburn Historical Engine and Machinery Society, told the Advertiser he was a 'good member and a good worker'. Detective Superintendent Peter De Santo said the alleged gunman was not related to the three victims. 'This is out of the blue and this has escalated out of a minor neighbour dispute,' Det Supt De Santo said. 'One body's been located in the paddock, one body's been located in the driveway and one body's been located at the rear entrance of the house. 'It's a tragic scene and how it's got out of hand from a minor dispute with tragic circumstances, it's just very hard to fathom how all of this has unfolded.' The man assisting police with their enquiries over the shooting was taken to hospital this morning and left just after midday. His wife was at the scene at the time - and is said to be 'okay' - and assisted investigators. Three family members have died after they were allegedly shot at Wedderburn near Bendigo . Officers were called to a rural property at 8.30pm (AEDT) on Wednesday following reports of gunshots . Loddon Shire mayor Gavan Holt said he understood the dispute was about farming. 'My information is that some time ago, a couple of years ago, they had a minor dispute - not a major issue and not a family matter – but a small disagreement over farming practices,' Mr Holt told Daily Mail Australia. He said the victims were very well know in the 1000-person town, with Mr Lockhart part of a five-generation farming family in the district. The man, a retired cereals and sheep farmer, lived on the property with his wife who was also killed. Mr Holmes, his stepson, lived on a house on an adjoining property. Mr Holt said the Lockharts and the man in custody all have other children with families  who live in Wedderburn, he added. Mr Holt said the community would support each other through the tragedy. 'All we can do is say we are there for you,' he said. 'There's lives wrecked here and it's our job to just be there for them in any way we can.' When officers arrived at the scene last night they found one person dead in the paddock of the Mulga Ridge Road property before police heard more gunshots, Superintendent Graham Kent said last night. 'Given the circumstances, police decided to withdraw from the scene,' he said. The incident took place in a small town more than 200km north-west of Melbourne . In the meantime, a man who was believed to have had a gun, contacted police on the phone and officers quickly cordoned off the area while trying to negotiate with the suspect. The man barricaded himself inside a home and after four hours of negotiations surrendered peacefully to police   and was arrested about midnight. After searching a nearby property, two more bodies were located. Police said the firearms involved in the incident were registered and had recently been inspected. There was no history of violence, major disputes or ongoing assaults between the neighbours, he said. 'There is some history of minor disputes in the past and when I say minor, at the very bottom end of disputes between neighbours,' Det Supt De Santo said. The 63-year-old is in custody and is assisting police with their enquiries. Homicide detectives are investigating the scene and a number of witnesses are being questioned.","The incident happened about 8.30pm on Wednesday in rural Victoria .

"The father and brother of heroic Queensland flood victim Jordan Rice have lost their house and are now living in a homeless shelter to survive, despite $456 million being donated to a Federal appeal for flood victims. John Tyson, 49, lost his wife Donna Rice, and his son Jordan, in the 2011 Queensland floods which devastated the region. The floods affected 70 towns and over 200,000 Australians. 35 people died in the crisis, including Donna and 13-year-old Jordan, who was hailed worldwide for his selfless act of bravery in the moments before his death. Scroll down for video . This image of Jordan Rice, 13, was published worldwide, praising him for his selfless act of bravery in the moments before his death .

John Tyson (back left), Chris Rice (back right) Blake Rice (front left) and Kyle Rice (front right) John's youngest son Blake, then 10, Jordan, and their mother Donna were trapped on the roof of their family's Mercedes Benz in the middle of floodwater when a passerby attempted the rescue the trio. Despite Jordan not knowing how to swim, he told them to rescue Blake first, seconds before being swept away with his mother by the raging current. The grief and anguish John Tyson experienced from the loss of his wife and son has been compounded by a series of events where he and son Blake have found themselves homeless. 'We just got to the point where we had no money. We slept in the car for week,' John told Daily Mail Australia. 'I asked myself, is this it? Is this what I'm destined to do?' John and Blake, have been living at the Blair Athol Uniting Church's crisis accommodation centre on the Gold Coast for the past 12 weeks. The community housing is a long way from their hometown of Toowoomba, where John owned two profitable businesses. 'When the floods happened a lot of people wanted to help me, and I mean a lot of people, worldwide,' John said. 'Instead of taking the money I chose to direct everything to the Premier's flood fund, which was what I believed was fair because there was a lot of other people suffering, not just me. 'I never wanted to be put above anyone else.' A now iconic image of Blake with rescuers in the aftermath of the floods went viral, and media outlets around the world published photos of Jordan, recognising his remarkable act of love and courage. 'It wasn’t me that promoted Jordan all over the world, it was politicians. I just thought I wanted people to be looked after fairly, which was my whole intent, and as a result over $450 million was raised with the flood fund.' John and his son Blake are living at the Blair Athol crisis center after finding themselves in financial ruins . The floods affected 70 towns and over 200,000 Australians. 35 people died in the crisis, including Donna and Jordan Rice . 'When the floods happened a lot of people wanted to help me, and I mean a lot of people, worldwide,' John said . John has been campaigning to have his son awarded the Cross of Valour posthumously, a move which was encouraged by Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the aftermath of the floods. His financial trouble's began when  he was approached by Queensland Police to aid a revamp. Desperate to improve the emergency response system which John believes failed his wife and son, he threw all of his energy, and money, into the project. John and several close friends pooled together over $500,000 of their personal savings, which was then poured into the creation of an innovative safety website and app. 'The police and associated personnel publicly encouraged me in the mainstream media, saying that I would be involved in a revamping of 000 system. They dangled a carrot if you will, knowing that I'm very passionate about this.' John alleges that the Royal Commission inquiry into the death of his wife and son discovered significant negligence, which he believes resulted in their death. 'There was a major shortfall in emergency services, which came out a year after their deaths,' John said. 'Less than eight minutes before they died there was a police car 20 meters away, six untasked firetrucks less than 100 meters away, and a police car that knocked off ten minutes early. They all neglected to help.' The passionate father channeled his grief into the revamp project, 'knowing that I could never heal until I was able to help prevent what happened to me from happening to others.' John invested all of his finances into the project, which involved the development of an app which synced with emergency services to link people in trouble to those nearby who could help.

John has been campaigning to have his son awarded the Cross of Valour, a move which was encouraged by Prime Minister Tony Abbott . 'I don’t want people to feel sorry for me, but to say to themselves that if it can happen to him, it could happen to me,' said John . The project developed over four years, only for John to be told last month that the project was unsuitable and should be taken to Neighbourhood Watch. 'They paid me lip service for the past 4 years, and it wasn’t until last month they told me my ideas needed to be taken elsewhere. 000 is privately owned, and not many people know that.' 'Politcians encouraged me, I got letters from ministers saying ‘how wonderful’. They all just turned to nothing, and the oucome was 'thanks for coming, we’re done, we never had intention of implementing it.' Not only had John poured all his savings into the project, he and his family never received any of the $450 million which was donated towards helping victims of the flood. 'A lot of people seem to think I got all this money, but I didn't get a thing.' 'I've learned there is a lot of money in misery,' John said, 'and I hope I can instigate some change in that area.' Despite explicit promises that the money would not be spent on infrastructure and would go towards helping flood victims return to normal life, a large portion of the money was spent on building projects. '$80 million was allocated to building the River Walk in Queensland, and a hefty lump of $100 million was spent in the Toowoomba range, but it wasn’t for flood mitigating projects. It went on road works,' said John. 'There was a major shortfall in emergency services, which came out a year after their deaths,' John said . 'Less than eight minutes before they died there was a police car 20 meters away, six untasked firetrucks less than 100 meters away, and a police car that knocked off ten minutes early. They all neglected to help,' John said . John and his son claim they never received any of the $450 million which was donated towards helping victims of the flood . With no more money and unable to find help, John searched frantically to provide a stable home for his son and was put in contact with the crisis accommodation center he now lives in. 'The center is home for now until I can formulate a way forward, and focus on how to get there from here.' The devoted father-of-three has been left feeling betrayed and confused, unable to move forward from the tragedy which took his wife and young son from him. 'Everything I've ever done has been built on honesty and trust. I've never doubted my ability to put good initiatives into place,' John said, . 'Emotionally, it's very draining. My way forward is helping, I just want to help, but I can't, so I'm unable to take even a step forward. I cant heal. These are the things that really get to me.' 'I don’t want people to feel sorry for me, but to say to themselves that if it can happen to him, it could happen to me.' For now, John and Blake, who John described as 'a very quiet and private boy', will remain in the crisis center until they can financially support themselves. Despite his living situation John is determined to continue to help others. 'I really feel that I should be allowed to help, to work on aiding people and lessening the impact of natural disaster and preventing loss of life,' he said. 'I try and that’s all you can do. If I come up short at least I tried.'

"Scientists have claimed they have produced a DVD that can hold 1,000 terabytes of data. That's a whopping 212,000 times more than a regular DVD's storage capacity of 4.7 gigabytes, meaning 40,000 HD movies could be stored on the new ultra-DVD format. The discs use lasers to write information down to a scale of just nine nanometres, allowing the high-storage discs to be made. Scientists at Swinburne University in Australia develop new DVD tech. Their method uses two lasers to write data to the old disc format (stock image shown). Previously DVDs had been limited to 4.7GB of data via laser writing, but using two beams of light this could be increased to an incredible 1,000 terabytes . The DVD has become all but obsolete in recent years with the rise of the Blu-ray format and cloud storage. But this new disc could herald a return for the discs, and they could provide a way to store huge amounts of data. Previously DVDs were limited due to what's called the refraction limit of light. In just over 30 years, humans will be able to upload their entire minds to computers and become digitally immortal - an event called the singularity - a futurist from Google said last year. Ray Kurzweil, director of engineering at Google, also claims that the biological parts of our body will be replaced with mechanical parts and this could happen as early as 2100. Kurweil made the claims during his conference speech at the Global Futures 2045 International Congress in New York in June 2013. Kurzweil said: 'Based on conservative estimates of the amount of computation you need to functionally simulate a human brain, we'll be able to expand the scope of our intelligence a billion-fold.' He referred to Moore's Law that states the power of computing doubles, on average, every two years quoting the developments from genetic sequencing and 3D printing. It had been thought light couldn't be made smaller than 500 nanometres, meaning DVDs had reached capacity for how much information could be stored. But Dr Gan and his team at Swinburne University in Australia found that by using two lasers they could reduce this down to just nine nanometres. It's likened to writing with a felt tip pen, the old method, and a fine-tipped pen, the new method. The innovative method involves using two beams of light to write data, both of which are 500 nanometres wide. However the second purple circular beam is used to block the first beam and leave just nine nanometres to strike the surface of the disc. This enables data to be written much more finely and greatly increases the storage capacity up to 1,000 terabytes. For comparison, one terabyte is equal to 1,000 gigabytes. 'In my mind, I have an vision for our society in the future where everyone will have a data bank account just like we all have a bank account today,' said creator Dr. Gan according to Pocket-Lint. 'We'll save all of our data in the data bank. Everyone no longer needs the same things today as phones, iPads or laptops. 'We only need a soft touch screen, any data processing, while storage is done remotely.' The team hasn't said when such a technology could become commercially available yet, and note a high cost in its development that could prove a problem. 'Putting so much information on a single disc makes it easier for people to destroy huge amounts of data and thus cost more to protect the disc,' Dr Gan continued. 'Also, we are now working to speed up for data reading and recording. If we're still using the current DVD speed, how long will it take to write 1,000 terabytes of data onto a disc?' The new DVD format would have enough storage to hold 40,000 HD movies. There's no news on when it might become commercially available yet though with the team noting cost and time problems need to be overcome .","Scientists at Swinburne University in Australia develop new DVD tech .

"September was the hottest ever recorded, forecasters have revealed - and they say 2014 is on course be be the hottest year in history. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration announced that last month the globe averaged 60.3 degrees Fahrenheit (15.72 degrees Celsius). That was the hottest September in 135 years of record keeping. Nasa says April to Sept was hottest on record. Their findings were backed up by the National Climatic Data Center. In this animation the deviation of global temperatures away from the average temperature are revealed, with blue being below average and red above average, for each month. The record-breaking heat goes back to the end of last year — November 2013 broke a record. So the 12 months from October 2013 to September 2014 are the hottest 12-month period on record, Blunden said. Earth hasn't set a monthly record for cold since December 1916, but all monthly heat record have been set after 1997. September also marks the third month in a row that Earth's oceans broke monthly heat records, but these are all-time records for how much hotter than normal they were . It was the fourth monthly record set this year, along with May, June and August. NASA, which measures temperatures slightly differently, had already determined that September was record-warm. The first nine months of 2014 have a global average temperature of 58.72 degrees (14.78 degrees Celsius), tying with 1998 for the warmest first nine months on record, according to NOAA's National Climatic Data Center in Asheville, N.C. 'It's pretty likely' that 2014 will break the record for hottest year, said NOAA climate scientist Jessica Blunden. The reason involves El Nino, a warming of the tropical Pacific Ocean that affects weather worldwide. In 1998, the year started off super-hot because of an El Nino. But then that El Nino disappeared and temperatures moderated slightly toward the end of the year. This year has no El Nino yet, but forecasts for the rest of the year show a strong chance that one will show up, and that weather will be warmer than normal, Blunden said. If 2014 breaks the record for hottest year, that also should sound familiar: 1995, 1997, 1998, 2005 and 2010 all broke NOAA records for the hottest years since records started being kept in 1880. 'This is one of many indicators that climate change has not stopped and that it continues to be one of the most important issues facing humanity,' said University of Illinois climate scientist Donald Wuebbles. Women shading themselves from the hot sun in the Chinatown section of downtown Los Angeles. Some non-scientists who are skeptical of man-made climate change have been claiming that the world has not warmed in 18 years, but 'no one's told the globe that,' Blunden said. She said NOAA records show no pause in warming. The record-breaking heat goes back to the end of last year — November 2013 broke a record. So the 12 months from October 2013 to September 2014 are the hottest 12-month period on record, Blunden said. This table shows how, year-on-year, temperatures continue to increase. For 2014 April, May, June and August were hotter than they have ever been. July was the fourth warmest it has been since 1880. It is the hottest middle six months of a year since record began, and it's likely that 2014 will rank as the hottest year on record . Earth hasn't set a monthly record for cold since December 1916, but all monthly heat record have been set after 1997. September also marks the third month in a row that Earth's oceans broke monthly heat records, but these are all-time records for how much hotter than normal they were, Blunden said.

California and Nevada set records for the hottest September. The major weather events of September . If Earth sets a record for heat in 2014 it probably won't last, said Jeff Masters, meteorology director for the private firm Weather Underground.

"A small Italian restaurant has tried a different approach to its lousy reviews on Yelp - instead of trying to boost its star rating, the chefs decided to encourage even more terrible write-ups. The campaign helped Botte Bistro get a rating of one out of five stars, as more than 1,000 reviewers left hundreds of tongue-in-cheek reviews panning the  eatery in Richmond, California, said chef Michele Massimo, adding that it boosted business. It was the latest protest among businesses who for years have complained that Yelp was extorting them by raising or dropping ratings depending on whether they advertised with the Web's most popular review site. Chef Michele Massimo prepares a salad at his restaurant Botto Bistro in Richmond, California earlier this month. The chef said appealing for one-star tongue-in-cheek reviews on Yelp has boosted his business . Yelp has persistently denied those claims on its website, in court and at every opportunity when the question is put publicly to the company. It recently got a federal appeals court to throw out a lawsuit alleging the extortion. 'It wouldn't pass the straight face test,' Yelp spokesman Vince Sullitto said of the extortion claims. Sullitto said Yelp attracts millions of viewers and sells advertising to 80,000 businesses because of the site's credibility with consumers. Sullitto said many of the company's critics are businesses that have received bad reviews. Last month, the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals tossed out a lawsuit filed by several businesses claiming Yelp extorted them by removing positive reviews after advertising sales pitches were turned down. The court is one rung below the U.S. Supreme Court and the ruling could have been a definitive one for Yelp. Badge of honor: Many restaurants are taking a stand against Yelp which has been accused of raising or dropping ratings depending on advertising spends . Instead, it served to fuel the company's critics because the court said that even if Yelp did manipulate reviews to penalize businesses, the practice would not constitute extortion. The court said it found no evidence of manipulation and that it was ruling narrowly only on the question of extortion. Nonetheless, the company's critics said the ruling supported their claims of sharp practices. Even before the 9th Circuit ruling, Yelp was battling two lawsuits filed by company investors who make similar extortion claims. The suits, filed in San Francisco federal court over the summer, allege that the company's stock traded at artificially inflated prices because the 'company tried to sell services designed to suppress negative reviews or make them go away' and then lied it. The company has yet to formally respond to the lawsuits in court, but says it will fight these legal actions as well. Last year, a lawyer serving as a small-claims judge in San Diego likened Yelp to a 'modern-day version of the Mafia going to stores and saying, ''You want to not be bothered? You want to not have incidents in your store? Pay us protection money.''' The judge, Peter Doft, made the comments when he ordered Yelp to pay San Diego lawyer Julian McMillan $2,700 over a contract dispute involving advertising on Yelp. The award was later overturned by a higher court, which ruled that McMillan's dispute with Yelp should be decided by an arbitrator instead of a court. McMillan didn't pursue his claim. The Bruschetta di pomodoro (pictured left) and seafood pasta, Botto Cioppino (right) at the Richmond eatery. The chefs appealed to diners to give their food tongue-in-cheek one-star reviews . Botte Bistro in Richmond, California, (pictured) is a traditional Tuscan trattoria and pizzeria own by  Italian chefs Davide Cerretini and Michele Massimo . But Yelp did file a lawsuit against McMillan, alleging he and his employees submitted fake Yelp reviews of his law practice. McMillan denies the charges and alleges that Yelp sued him because of his small-claims court victory. The allegations are so widespread and have persisted for so long that the company asks on its Web site: 'Does Yelp extort small businesses?' The company answers no. Yelp has had a complicated relationship with merchants, restaurateurs and other small businesses on which the company depends on for advertising revenue. To attract advertising, Yelp needs to maintain a popular and credible site. To do this, Yelp says, its uses an algorithm to weed out fake reviews submitted by business owners, relatives and friends that is often misunderstood. The automated removal programs accidentally erase many positive reviews written by legitimate customers. Yelp concedes that removing legitimate reviews is not ideal, but argues that's the price it pays for its credibility. Furthermore, Yelp keeps details of its algorithm under wraps so its review system can't be easily exploited and gamed. That secrecy also breeds suspicion. 'We don't know who is leaving the reviews and we don't think it's fair,' said Massimo, the chef. 'You are so vulnerable.' Massimo said he and his partner decided to launch their novel protest for a one-star rating after receiving several aggressive sales calls from Yelp that they perceived to be veiled threats. The ploy worked and business continue to be brisk, he said. 'It was the best marketing idea I've ever had,' Massimo said.

"A passenger who died in a fall aboard a Carnival cruise ship at a Miami dock has been identified as a 20-year-old college student from South Carolina. Kendall Wernet, of Moncks Corner, fell to his death from a mast Monday aboard the Carnival Ecstasy ship. The vessel was docked at Miami's port when Wernet apparently climbed its forward mast in a restricted area and plummeted to the deck below. Tragic loss: Kendall Wernet, 20, a student at Clemson University, has been named as the passenger who died in a fall aboard a Carnival cruise ship at a Miami dock . Deadly accident: Kendall plummeted to his death from a mast Monday aboard the Carnival Ecstasy ship . Police said the Clemson University junior fell a distance equal to two decks on the ship. Wernet was pronounced dead at a hospital just before 8.30am from blunt force trauma to the head. There is no evidence of foul play, according to detectives, and all signs point to the death as an accident. Clemson University Dean of Students Shannon Finning released a statement to the press expressing condolences to Wernet's family and friends, as did Carnival Cruise lines. Wernet, a management major, went on the three-day cruise to the Bahamas as part of an awards weekend for top performers at the organization Student Painters - a group dedicated to teaching young people how to run small businesses. Steve Acorn, director of Student Painters, told Fox Carolina that Wernet has been part of the organization for three years, working as a regional manager and executive. 'Everyone that he came around and that he touched really respected him and was just happy that they were working with Kendall because of his great skills, and ability and compassion,' said Acorn.

Goal-oriented: Kendall Wernet, pictured with his father, Bob, left and right, was a junior majoring in management . A force for good: Wernet (far left) has been part of Student Painters for three years . Describing the 20-year-old man as mature and compassionate, Acorn insisted that Wernet was not drinking or doing drugs at the time of the accident. The Clemson junior and four of his friends apparently decided to climb the mast to watch the sunrise over Miami, according to Acorn. The men ascended to the platform about 20 feet in the air shortly before 5am and were hanging out, talking about their goals for the future, when a radar dish on the ship swung around and struck Wernet, knocking him off the mast. Wernet was treated by medics aboard the cruise ship until it docked. The unconscious man was then rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Chase Lawson, a fellow Clemson student who was also aboard the ship, described Wernet as someone who has touched many lives. 'We lost a brother yesterday, but his spirit and heart will live on in all of us forever and always,' Lawson wrote on his Facebook page Tuesday. Happy family: Kendall pictured with (left to right) his father Bob, sister Kaitlin and mother Helen . Life extinguished: The 20-year-old has been described as a mature and compassionate person . Wernet's tragic passing comes as yet another blow to the Clemson University community, which has lost five students since June. A week before the cruise ship accident, sophomore Tucker Hipps was found dead in Lake Hartwell after a run with his fraternity brothers. Kendall Wernet is survived by his parents, Bob and Helen Wernet, and his sister, Kaitlin. ‘[He] had a heart of gold and loved to do the right thing,’ Bob Wernet was quoted as saying in his son’s obituary. Wernet graduated from Roberson High School in Arden, where he was a captain of the cross country and track teams, played in a band, was a member of the National Honor Society and earned a 4.4 GPA, reported WCNC.

Another loss: Wernet's death comes a week after sophomore Tucker Hipps (right) was found dead in a lake after a run with his fraternity brothers . As a manager at Student Painter, he worked up to 70 hours a week in the summer. He also co-founded his own company called The Driven Vision to inspire the next generation of young professionals. ‘He was the kind of guy, that if you had a daughter, you’d want him to marry her,’ Steve Acorn said.

"Tragedy: Sylvia Page, 86, was being helped from her bed when she stumbled and banged her head against a wall, an inquest heard . A great grandmother died when she fell over and hit her head on a wall after an unsupervised student nurse tried to help her out of her hospital bed, an inquest heard. Sylvia Page, 86,  died in June last year, 11 days after being admitted to the Princess Alexandra Hospital in Harlow, Essex. A student nurse was trying to move  from her from a bed to the toilet when Mrs Page stumbled and was injured. Her family, who have been awarded five-figure compensation by the NHS Trust, have criticised poor staff training at the hospital. The inquest into Mrs Page's death heard no risk assessment was carried out and the trainee nurse worker was unsupervised when she fell. Mrs Page's son Michael, 62, said he had 'little faith' that things would improve and said his mother's death was a result of 'poor training and inadequate procedures'. He said: 'My brother and I, and our families, are devastated by the loss of our mother, and the circumstances in which she died. 'We believe her death was a direct result of poor training and inadequate procedures. 'We did receive a letter of apology from the hospital but it's of little consolation. They have promised to implement procedures to ensure it doesn't happen again. 'However, I have little faith that things will improve. I hope I'm wrong as I would hate for anyone to go through a similar experience as us.' An inquest in Chelmsford, Essex in March heard how Mrs Page was admitted to hospital after a fall and treated on the Lister ward for head injuries. She was fatally injured when a student nurse attempted to move her to a commode. The health worker held her hands in a bid to keep her steady but Mrs Page fell and hit her head on a wall and she died two days later from bleeding on the brain. Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said the hospital failed to carry out the risk assessment required when moving a frail patient to a new environment. She added that the student nurse had used poor technique and been inadequately supervised and monitored. The coroner concluded: 'There were failings in the care provided by Princess Alexandra Hospital.' Criticism: Princess Alexandra Hospital, Harlow, Essex, failed to properly care for Mrs Page when it allowed a student nurse to help her out of bed unsupervised . The family's solicitor David Kerry said: 'This sad case is yet another example of the poor and inadequate care that is too often provided to the elderly by the NHS. 'Increasingly, we are seeing cases where elderly patients have suffered falls whilst in hospital and, as a consequence, suffer serious injury that sometimes results in their death. 'These should be largely preventable in this day and age. 'It's nothing short of a national disgrace that the elderly, many of whom have made a massive contribution to this country, are subjected to such poor treatment in their later lives. 'The NHS simply does not provide sufficient care or compassion. At a basic level, training can be inadequate and supervision of front-line staff non-existent. 'Sylvia Page's family were devastated at her loss. Her two sons, grandchildren and great grandchildren will remember her for her love of life and independence. 'It makes it all the more sad that when she needed to depend on others, she was so badly let down.' A spokeswoman for The Princess Alexandra Hospital NHS Trust said: 'We have apologised to the family for the identified failings in the care provided to Mrs Page, which fell short of the standard of care that patients can reasonably expect to receive. 'Following this incident a thorough review was undertaken and a comprehensive action plan put in place, to ensure that such failings will not occur in the future.'","Sylvia Page died 11 days after her admission to hospital in Harlow, Essex .

"The FBI has closed down a website selling a 'spyware' app which allowed people complete access to their victim's smartphones, including all calls and texts as well as operating the phone's microphone turning the device into a powerful bug. Federal investigators arrested Pakistani national Hammad Akbar, 31, from Lahore in Los Angeles on Saturday for selling his StealthGenie app, which was marketed as undetectable and untraceable. According to the indictment, the app allowed the interception of all incoming and outgoing calls on a mobile phone to be monitored in real time. It also gave the user complete access to all data on the victims phone while also allowing them to monitor all conversations within 15 feet of the handset. The FBI arrested Hammad Akbar in Los Angeles on Saturday after investigating the StealthGenie app . Akbar is CEO of InvoCode PVT Ltd who marketed the SmartGenie App which is at the centre of the investigation . The company boasted it had more than 100,000 'satisfied customers' for the $59.99 app before the website was blocked by the the FBI . Andrew McCabe, assistant director of the Washington Field Office said: 'This application allegedly equips potential stalkers and criminals with a means to invade an individual’s confidential communications. 'They do this not by breaking into their homes or offices, but by physically installing spyware on unwitting victims’ phones and illegally tracking an individual’s every move.' According to the FBI, users of the app only need to access the phone for a couple of minutes to install the software, which works on Apple, Android and Blackberry type handsets. The FBI said: 'StealthGenie’s capabilities included recording and intercepting calls and monitoring e-mails, text messages, voicemails, photos, videos, and calendar appointments. The software could also activate a victim’s phone to eavesdrop on conversations within a 15-foot radius. All the communications could be viewed on a web-based dashboard.' The app was developed by InvoCode Pvt Ltd who are based in Lahore, Pakistan, but the company had a data centre in Asburn Virginia. The FBI secured a court order on September 26 to temporarily take the service off-line while the investigation continues. According to the FBI: 'This is the first-ever criminal case concerning the advertisement and sale of a mobile device spyware app. Marketing for the app targeted people suspicious that their spouses or romantic partners might be cheating on them.' Leslie Caldwell, assistant attorney general of the Justice Department's Criminal Division said: 'Selling spyware is not just reprehensible, it's a crime. 'Apps like StealthGenie are expressly designed for use by stalkers and domestic abusers who want to know every detail of a victim's personal life – all without the victim's knowledge. The Criminal Division is committed to cracking down on those who seek to profit from technology designed and used to commit brazen invasions of individual privacy.' 'StealthGenie has little use beyond invading a victim's privacy' said U.S. Attorney Boente. 'Advertising and selling spyware technology is a criminal offense, and such conduct will be aggressively pursued by this office and our law enforcement partners.' StealthGenie customers could log onto the internet and monitor the victim's phone without their knowledge . According to the indictment, Akbar and his co-conspirators allegedly programmed StealthGenie to synchronise all the data from the victim's phone with their customer's account to all them access to the handset over the internet. Prosecutors allege: 'To install the app, a purchaser needed to obtain physical control over the phone to be monitored for only a few minutes. The purchaser could then review communications intercepted from the monitored phone without ever again having physical control over the phone. Akbar and others alleged designed SteathGenie to be undetectable to users of the phone.' The indictment claims that the app was designed for suspicious husbands or wives who suspected their partners of cheating or 'if they just want to monitor them'. According to the Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3): ' The purchaser can review information transferred from the target mobile phone via an online portal. These intercepted communications are stored on the StealthGenie website. For example, a purchaser can log-in to the online portal to access information pulled from the user's phone such as messages, e-mail, photos, and phone calls. 'Mobile device spyware apps are developed and advertised as being invisible to targets and act in an undetectable manner. For example, an app can be installed to look like another type of app or file, such as a digital photo application. 'Therefore, it will be difficult for the non-expert user to determine whether or not spyware is on his or her phone.' According to IC3, anyone who suspects they may have spyware on their mobile phone should immediately perform a factory reset which will delete all data and apps installed after the handset was purchased.","StealthGenie allowed suspicious partners to monitor their partner's phone .

"Two sisters without driving licences led police on a 90mph car chase before asking officers for a cigarette when they were finally flagged down. Police initially tried to stop Amy Humpage, 25, as she drove her sister, Laura, 27, in a BMW near their home in Castle Vale, Birmingham, but she shut the car window on an officer's thumb and sped off, Birmingham Crown Court heard. Then ensued a high speed chase - during which the sisters swapped seats - which only ended when they crashed the car in Aston, a court was told. Scroll down for video . Laura Humpage, 27, left, and her sister Amy, 25, right, led police on a high-speed chase through Birmingham . The two sisters,  pictured above outside Birmingham Crown Court, admitted driving offences and were banned . During the chase the sisters shook off two police cars but were caught by a third when they crashed into a wall . Officers told the court that Amy Humpage had 'clearly been drinking' when they flagged her white BMW 118 cabriolet down early one morning last month. They said they then gave chase after she closed the car window on an officer's thumb but the first police car was shaken off. By the time a second patrol car caught up with the BMW Laura Humpage was at the wheel, speeding along Fort Parkway in the city at 70mph. Miss Humpage drove on the wrong side of the road, jumped three red lights, turned right blindly and almost lost control as she sped around a roundabout near Spaghetti Junction, but she managed to shake off two police cars in the chase. A third car caught up with them as they crashed the car into a wall, demolishing it, at around 7am on September 7. The sisters then refused to get out of the vehicle when officers asked them to, so police smashed the window with a baton. Laura Humpage, left, has a one-year-old son, Birmingham Crown Court was told.  Amy pictured right . The sisters have both been banned from driving after admitting driving offences at Birmingham Crown Court . When Laura Humpage, pictured, and her sister were eventually stopped by police, they asked for a cigarette . Alistair Redford, prosecuting, said: 'When the car was stopped Laura handed the keys over and asked officers for a cigarette. 'Amy was clearly drunk but failed to provide a specimen.' The older of the two was breath-tested and was found to be under the drink-drive limit but had alcohol in her system. Both sisters were arrested at the scene and appeared in court yesterday. Laura Humpage, who has a one-year-old son, pleaded guilty to dangerous driving and driving without insurance and a licence. The court heard she had suffered mental health problems and had been sectioned in the past. She was handed a 12-month suspended sentence and a supervision order. Her younger sister admitted careless driving, failing to provide a specimen and having no licence, and was given a two-month suspended sentence and ordered to pay £250. Both sisters were also banned from driving.","Amy Humpage, 25, was driving a BMW with her sister Laura, 27, on board .

"Kath Locket was diagnosed with Foreign Accent Syndrome after she began to sound Polish . A mother-of-two proud of her Staffordshire accent was shocked when she woke up sounding like an Eastern European. Kath Locket went to bed one night, but was later rushed into hospital unable to speak or swallow. Baffled doctors eventually diagnosed her with Foreign Accent Syndrome, a condition that has only ever affected 150 people worldwide . It emerged a rare condition had caused slight damage to the part of her brain controlling language. This meant that despite being born and bred in Staffordshire, she was left with a strong accent that sounded distinctly European. Ms Lockett says she now feels she feels robbed because  she sounds nothing like her family and friends - and is mistaken as a foreigner by people in her local area. As someone who used to phone into local radio stations regularly, she still has recordings of how her voice used to sound before the incident eight years ago. Now, she bursts into tears at the sound of her former Staffordshire accent. She told ITV's This Morning: 'I feel like I’ve been robbed. 'Now all I get is Italian, Lithuanian, Hungarian, Russian, Polish. 'I have no homeland now.  I want to go home, that’s all I want to do.’ Mrs Locket, who has always lived in Stafford, had been suffering ill health and headaches before she lost her accent. One night she spoke to her sister on the phone and noticed her voice was changing. She told This Morning presenters Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden: ‘I started off with just a lisp and I was a bit concerned. ‘With ill health I got over-fatigued, so I thought it was that and went to bed. ‘But when I woke up it was still there and this lisp was getting a little bit strange. ‘On the Tuesday, I was fine and went to work. At that time I could speak. ‘By Wednesday morning, it was starting to go like an alien. ‘And by Thursday, it had gone completely and I lost my swallow as well.’ Doctors confirmed Ms Locket had been struck down with a rare brain condition called severe cerebral vasculitis and she was rushed to hospital. She said: ‘It was so scary for my family - they were terrified for me. I was in hospital for 13 days and a tumour was mentioned. 'I had to write everything down because I couldn't speak. By the time I left, I was half a stone lighter because I couldn’t swallow.' Foreign Accent Syndrome  is speech disorder that causes a sudden change to speech so that a native speaker is perceived to speak with a “foreign” accent. Foreign Accent Syndrome is most often caused by damage to the brain caused by a stroke or traumatic brain injury. Other causes have also been reported including multiple sclerosis and conversion disorder. In some cases no clear cause has been identified. Speech may be altered in terms of timing, intonation, and tongue placement, so that is perceived as sounding foreign. Listeners can usually still understand the sufferer's speech; it does not necessarily sound disordered. Foreign Accent Syndrome has been documented in cases around the world, including accent changes from Japanese to Korean, British English to French, American-English to British English, and Spanish to Hungarian. There have only ever been 150 confirmed cases of Foreign Accent Syndrome in the world so far. Despite still having a stammer, Ms Locket said she was delighted when she was finally allowed to go home. But she soon noticed people reacting strangely when she spoke. She said: 'My daughters said I needed to get out, fresh air would do me good. 'So I went to the local art gallery in Stafford. 'Instantly, one of the ladies said ""Will you fill in a questionnaire?"". 'I said ""No, it's OK"". 'And she said ""What part of Poland are you from?"". 'And my daughter got a bit upset and defensive and she said ""No, she’s from here"". Then, on the bus home, two strangers overheard her accent. Ms Locket recalled: 'He asked me what part of Russia I was from. ''I thought ""What is this, can’t people see it’s just I haven’t been very well?""' A few days later, Mrs Locket’s daughter saw an article in the paper about Foreign Accent Syndrome. It told the story of a lady from Newcastle upon Tyne who lost her Geordie accent and now speaks with a Jamaican lilt. Mrs Locket managed to track down Professor Nick Miller from Newcastle University, a specialist in speech disorders who had helped the lady in the article. Professor Miller made the diagnosis of Foreign Accent Syndrome, a condition so rare there were just 61 confirmed cases between 1941 and 2012. Foreign Accent Syndrome is where damage to the parts of the brain controlling speech result in a speech impediment which leave the sufferer sounding like someone from abroad. The causes are unknown, and there is no current cure. Mrs Locket (left) says the syndrome has robbed her of her identity as she no longer sounds as though she is from Staffordshire. Speech disorder expert Professor Rosemary Varley says loss of identity is a common psychological effect of the rare condition . However the psychological effects on sufferers can be devastating. Ms Locket has now decided to campaign to raise awareness of the psychological effects people that with Foreign Accent Syndrome suffer. Professor Rosemary Varley, an expert in speech disorders at University College London said psychological effects, such as loss of identity, are well known in Foreign Accent Syndrome sufferers. She said: 'When you hear a voice down a telephone you make judgements about the sex, the age, the mood. 'You also have a guess at their education, what job they do and their regional identity. ‘What Foreign Accent Syndrome does is robs you of that regional aspect.’ She added that the condition is 'not at all well-understood'. Cases are very sporadic, there is no centre for the study of the syndrome and as a result sufferers are often sent to many different doctors before being diagnosed, she said. As well as speaking in a seemingly foreign accent, sufferers also forget words or struggle to speak with correct grammar, she added. For Mrs Locket, these symptoms are all too familiar. ‘I have medical students come to my house. I’m a living study’ she said. Meeting other people with the syndrome has helped, and she know wants to campaign to raise awareness about how the syndrome affects sufferers, and why a cure is so desperately needed. Mrs Locket said: 'I’m here to give other Foreign Accent Syndrome sufferers a voice. 'It's not just a headlines in a paper. It’s much bigger than that. ‘It changes the dynamics. I don’t speak like my brother, I don’t speak like my ma. 'I had struggled saying my daughter’s name, my son gets a terrible time. ‘You don’t realise what it is until it’s gone. ‘Just think for one moment if the voice you have today, the voice your mother has, if they lost that. If they sounded like me.’","Kath Locket was born and bred in Stafford and proud of her regional accent .

"A family are calling for people to stop referring to terror group Islamic State as ISIS to avoid confusion with their eight-year-old's name. Frank and Sheridan Leskien - from Bexley in Sydney's south - named their daughter, Isis, after the Egyptian goddess who was portrayed as a model wife and mother, and is the patroness of nature and magic. Now the name is associated with the terror organisation Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) - also known as Islamic State - who have claimed responsibility for beheading U.S. and British nationals on camera. Parents Sheridan and Frank (back centre and right) Leskien say people are now treating their family differently because their daughter's name is associated with Islamic State . Isis' parents have appealed to the media and the public to stop using the name to refer to the terror group before harm comes to one of the 'tens of thousands' of women who share the same name. 'It's a beautiful name we spent so long choosing it. [The Egyptian goddess] Isis is a nurturer and someone who cares. People used to say to us: ""What a beautiful name"",' Mr Leskien told Daily Mail Australia. But the father-of-two said people were now distancing themselves from his family. 'This is hurting my little family and we've lost family because they're scared and don't want anything to do with us...it's soul-destroying,' he said. Islamic State are known by numerous names, including Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), and have claimed responsibility for beheadings of U.S. and British nationals . 'I have been calling her Isis for eight years, if not longer, because I was calling her Isis while she was in the womb. 'Do we have to wait until something that happens to one of them before [someone listens]?' The Leskiens were adamant this was not about race or religion but about the safety of their daughter. Isis is an Egyptian goddess who is known as a model mother, and is the patroness of nature and magic . 'I just want her name to be safe and be what it's meant to be,' Mr Leskien said. 'All I really want is to go back to my quiet simple life. We’re just simple people. 'What I can do is try as hard as I can as a father to protect my daughter.' Mr Leskien said his 13-year-old son, Maximus, had already had to defend his sister's name at school. 'We go to soccer and I call out ""Isis"" and people look at me,' he said. 'People are scared to...be associated with us.' But the Leskiens are not the only one taking up the fight to reclaim the name, Isis. A U.S. woman named Isis Martinez has started up the Thousands of Women and Girls Named Isis, Petition Media to Stop Calling the Terrorists by Our Name petition, asking people to show their support to 'save' the name. 'You can help save the name of #ThousandsofWomenNamedIsis and save us from the backlash of being associated with this horrific terrorist group of monsters,' Ms Martinez wrote in a post on the petition. 'Little girls, especially in the United States, named Isis have reported bullying while women with the name are facing negative associations through their employment and in public places like airports, airplanes even at times being called terrorists themselves. 'These shameful excuses for human beings should not have been assigned an English acronym with the name of thousands of women and children but there's still time to change the course of this path and more accurate names available.' So far the care2 petition - which was started by Isis Martinez - has attracted almost 33,000 signatures.","Sydney's Frank and Sheridan Leskien have a young daughter named Isis .

"Men's brains are wired to make them ignore food when sex is on the menu, researchers have claimed. A study found that men can suppress their hunger in order to focus on finding a mate. The study by the University of Rochester Medical Centre point to how subtle changes in the brain's circuitry dictate differences in behaviour between males and females. A study found that men can suppress their hunger in order to focus on finding a mate (stock image shown) Assistant Professor Douglas Portman said: 'While we know that human behaviour is influenced by numerous factors, including cultural and social norms, these findings point to basic biological mechanisms that may not only help explain some differences in behaviour between males and females, but why different sexes may be more susceptible to certain neurological disorders.' The research looked at a microscopic roundworm called C. elegans and focussed on a pair of neurones called AWA that are strongly linked to hunger and finding a partner. Scientists looked at two genders, males and hermaphrodites, who are mating partners for males and are considered to be the equivalent of females. They put the worms in a petri dish and gave them food, leaving them the option to either feed or go in search of a mate. Some worms had been genetically engineered to make them more sensitive to the smell of food by tampering with their neurones. The findings were made in experiments involving C. elegans, a microscopic roundworm that has long been used by researchers to understand fundamental mechanisms in biology. Many of the discoveries made using C. elegans apply throughout the animal kingdom and this research has led to a broader understanding of human biology. In fact, three Nobel Prizes in medicine and chemistry have been awarded for discoveries involving C. elegans. C. elegans is particularly useful in the study of the nervous system and scientists understand in great detail the development, function, and multiple connections of its entire neural network. The research looked at a microscopic roundworm called C. elegans and focussed on a pair of neurones called AWA that are strongly linked to hunger and finding a partner. It was revealed that the normal male worms left their food source and went in search of a mate. However the males who had been genetically engineered to be 'hungrier' were ten times less successful at mating as they wanted to stay by the food source. The hermaphrodites stayed put and simply waited near the food source. The study published in the journal Current Biology suggests that the normal worms were able to ignore or even suppress their hunger in favour of finding a mate. Prof Portman in the Department of Biomedical Genetics and Center for Neural Development and Disease said: 'These findings show that by tuning the properties of a single cell, we can change behaviour. 'This adds to a growing body of evidence that sex-specific regulation of gene expression may play an important role in neural plasticity and, consequently, influence differences in behaviours - and in disease susceptibility - between the sexes.'","Study found that males  suppress  hunger to focus on finding a mate .

'I got home from a busy day - I had a few drinks as well I might add - and I went outside to check the lights,' Meldrum said on the Sunday Night program. Meldrum climbed a ladder in his backyard, slipped and hit his head on an Egyptian statue. ‘I remember falling and thinking oh my god what have I done and then bang,’ Meldrum said. He suffered head injuries, a fractured skull, swelling to the brain, cracked vertebrae, broken shoulder and ribs. Meldrum underwent a number of surgical procedures. The TV star admits it took a long time for him to get the courage to go out into his backyard. 'And even now I can't look at people climbing ladders - it just freaks me out'. Luckily, Meldrum lived to see another day and the out-pour of love that came from Australians praying for the TV star. The former Countdown presenter said he had been touched by the support from friends, family and fans during the time of the accident. 'All the cards, the emails, flowers and everything - it was overwhelming - I didn't know how to handle it,' he said. Surviving the fall prompted Meldrum to finish his autobiography and take a walk down memory lane.

The music legend made his mark in Australia when becoming the host of Countdown, a weekly pop music show, in 1974. 'When we started, we did the eight shows and I thought that was it. 'We never ever thought we would go on year, after year, after year, after year and become so popular.' The weekly TV series stayed on air for 13 years. Australian musician and TV presenter, Red Symons, describes Meldrum's talent as completely natural and innocently incompetent. 'His great strength as a interviewer is that he's obviously completely incompetent whenever you see him interview somebody, so he sets people at ease,' said Symons, who shared the screen with Meldrum on Hey, Hey It's Saturday, a long-time running comedy program in Australia. Success followed Meldrum, as he became an iconic figure in Australian music and pop culture .

But before Meldrum rose to fame, life was not easy. Growing up in a small country town in Victoria, Quambatook, the TV star was raised by his aunties and uncles after his mother was placed in a psychiatric ward for depression. In the early 60s Meldrum was sent to St Kilda in Melbourne to finish high-school - he was living with his aunties when he introduced himself to one of his neighbours - Ronnie Burns. 'He said, ""My name is Ian Meldrum... I need to get away from my aunties could I come and live with you for two weeks?,""' Burns said. 'He stayed nine and a half years. 'Looking back and in hindsight, he was looking for a family.' Both Burns, an Australian rock singer and guitarist, and Meldrum found their place in the music world through their love of The Beatles.

'We had this pissy, little radio and suddenly they played this song - I wanna hold your hand - I was like, ""What's that?"" - I was hooked,' Meldrum said. Meldrum's passion for music led to a career in music reporting, and then eventually saw him producing - his first song, Russell Morris' hit, The Real Thing. Success followed Meldrum, as he became an iconic figure in Australian music and pop culture. On the Sunday night program, Meldrum revealed his dream of marriage and having a family and openly discussed past relationships with men. When asked whether he is gay, straight or bisexual, Meldrum replied simply, 'I love everyone - I love the company of girls.' He said the desire to have a family stemmed from his up-bringing. 'I've never really had a ""family-family"", so I've always had my friends to become part of my family.'

"While New York and London may be cities that never sleep, in large parts of the world, the internet rests like a living creature each night. A new animated map by US researchers reveals how large parts of Africa, Russia and Australia follow a 'diurnal usage' pattern. This means that internet usage peaks as the day progresses and then almost stops as the sun goes down. Scroll down for video . In the map, the pink and red blocks show higher internet usage, while blue blocks suggest lower than average web activity . In contrast, the UK, US, India, and East Asia are active throughout the night, according to a recent study by the University of Southern California. Over the course of two months, researchers pinged 3.7 million IP address blocks - representing almost one billion of the world's four billion IPv4 addresses - every 11 minutes. 'The internet is important in our lives and businesses, from streaming movies to buying online,' said Professor John Heidemann from the University of Southern California. 'Measuring network outages is a first step to improving Internet reliability.' In the map, the pink and red blocks show higher internet usage, while blue blocks suggest lower than average web activity. Tthe UK, US, India, and East Asia are active through the night, according to recent data collected in California . The internet has revolutionised the way we communicate and a third of the world’s population use it to stay connected. Now, Texas-based internet cartographer and computer scientist John Matherly has used software to ‘ping’ all of these global web devices and create a map demonstrating the technology’s global reach. In the majority of cases, this signal was sent to routers rather than individual gadgets, but Mr Matherly said iPhone and Android devices have appeared previously. The cartographer said it took around five hours to ping all IP addresses on August 2. The map then took more than 12 hours to create. 'Pinging' an IP address involves sending a signal to the device from a server, which causes the connection to 'light up' - albeit not physically. Mr Matherly is founder of Shodan, a search engine for connected devices.  Different colours represent the density of devices in that region, and unsurprisingly, the world’s largest cities in developed countries glow the brightest. Red areas contain a lot of web-enabled devices, while green areas contain fewer. Black areas are regions where no signal was received. While it may be no surprise that there seem to be less internet-connected devices in parts of Africa, Mr Matherly explained his map is not precise because some organisations block ping requests. It is thought that areas of China should be coloured bright red on the map, but the country’s ‘Great Firewall’ explains why most of the country looks dark. Connected: Texas-based internet cartographer and computer scientist John Matherly has used software to ‘ping’ global web devices to build a map (pictured) demonstrating the technology’s global reach . The researchers say the diurnal usage seems to be correlated with countries than use dial-up links which could be shut down during the night, or with those who want to conserve electricity. The finding could help scientists and policymakers develop better systems to measure and track internet outages, such as those that struck the New York area after Hurricane Sandy. Understanding how the Internet sleeps may help them avoid confusing a sleeping internet with an internet outage. 'This work is one of the first to explore how networking policies affect how the network is used,' Professor Heidemann said. 'This data helps us establish a baseline for the internet — to understand how it functions, so that we have a better idea of how resilient it is as a whole, and can spot problems quicker . The team's work is ongoing. 'We have grown our coverage to four million blocks [more than one billion addresses] as internet use grows,' Professor Heidemann added.

In separate research, a firm called IVPN recently created a map of internet freedom around the world based on a Freedom House report in 2013.

They were then graded as free, partly free or not free and marked on a map in white, pink and red respectively. Countries marked in grey were not included in the report. China, Iran and Syria were found to be the top three user rights violators when it comes to online freedom.","US researchers pinged 3.7 million IP address blocks over two months .

"A judge has caused outrage after he told a man who downloaded nearly 2,000 child porn images that he was not a paedophile. Judge John Holt made the comment while hearing the case of Chris Gilland, 34, whose vile collection showed children as young as two. The US citizen, who is married with two young girls, faced up to three years behind bars for the offences. But after reading a pre-sentence report, which described Gilland as a ‘voyeur’ rather than a paedophile, Judge Holt let him walk free with a two-year community order. He told the defendant: ‘I am quite satisfied that you are not a paedophile.’ Anger: Judge John Holt (pictured) has outraged children's charities after telling Christopher Gilland (left) - who admitted possessing almost 2,000 indecent images of children - that he is not a paedophile . Child abuse charities attacked the judge’s decision as ‘dangerous’. Peter Saunders, of the National Association for People Abused in Childhood, said: ‘That’s a wonderful message to send to society – that someone who pays to watch children being abused is given a rap on the knuckles and told they are not a danger to children. ‘This judge has given a very inappropriate, misguided and quite alarming sentence.’ John Brown, of the NSPCC, said: ‘Anyone who downloads indecent images of children should be considered capable of posing a risk, and a custodial sentence is usually an appropriate one.’ And Claude Knight, of child safety campaigners Kidscape, said: ‘The sheer number of images downloaded would certainly lead one to conclude predatory tendencies exist.’ Gilland is understood to be a former corporal in the US Marines who was working in the commissary at RAF Lakenheath, where the US Air Force’s 48th Fighter Wing is based. Prosecutor Russell Butcher told Ipswich Crown Court that police raided Gilland’s home in the town on October 25 last year. They seized computers and storage devices that had 1,835 indecent images and 34 videos. Some scenes involved animals. Gilland admitted six offences of possessing indecent images of children, one of possession of a prohibited image of a child and two of possessing extreme pornography at Ipswich Crown Court (pictured) Gilland claimed he had downloaded the child porn by accident while viewing adult images, and planned to delete them. But in court he admitted six charges of possessing indecent images of children, one of possessing a prohibited image of a child, and two of possessing extreme pornography. Defence counsel Hugh Rowland said his client had no previous convictions and most of the images were at the lowest level of seriousness. Under the community order, Gilland will be supervised by the probation service for two years and have to take part in an Internet Sex Offenders Programme. His wife, Robin, a dental assistant with the US Air Force, attended the sentencing on Wednesday and the court heard she was standing by him. There was no answer at the couple’s home last night. A spokesman for the 48th Fighter Wing yesterday said Gilland no longer worked at the base and had been ‘barred from the installation’. Judge Holt, 67, who has been a circuit judge since 1998, was criticised in 2006 for handing a two-year jail term to Zimbabwe-born Isaac Mutubila, 29, who groomed and then raped a 12-year-old girl. He could have been sentenced to life but the judge claimed the sentence was ‘significant’.","Christopher Gilland admitted downloading 1,834 obscene photos of children .

"For anyone who’s ever hankered after making others laugh for a living, now could be the time to pick up your pen and get drawing. Each year the British Cartoonists’ Association’s Young Cartoonists of the Year competition attracts thousands of entries – and gives budding cartoonists the chance to have their work judged by the best in the business. The panel this year includes the cartoonists from nearly every national daily newspaper, including the Daily Mail’s incomparable Mac. Another judge is Oliver Preston, chairman of the Cartoon Museum in London, whose work has appeared in publications ranging from The Field to The Spectator. Entries can be on any subject, and be anything from a political cartoon to a strip cartoon or a simple joke . He said: ‘There’s no set path to becoming a cartoonist. ‘If you want to become a plumber or an electrician, you go on a course. If you want to become a cartoonist you just have to keep sending your material in to magazines. ‘It’s a very, very difficult profession to get into and make a living from unless you’re at the very top of your game, but some of our past winners have gone on to become professional cartoonists. ‘So many people from all different backgrounds will know someone who loves drawing cartoons, and we want to encourage them all to enter.’ Entries can be on any subject, and be anything from a political cartoon to a strip cartoon or a simple joke. The winners are invited to the Cartoon Art Trust annual fundraising and awards ceremony where they have the chance to rub shoulders with the great and good of the cartoon art world. Cartoonists’ association chairman Martin Rowson said: ‘As judges, sometimes we’re more impressed by a good gag, sometimes by the quality of the drawing. It’s an artless art and what we’re looking for is that special cartoony quality. One of Mac's recent cartoons pokes fun at a comment made by David Cameron last week . ‘I always have a joke with the winners that the real reason we have the competition is so we can isolate the good ones, break their fingers and make sure they’re not a threat to us.’ There are two age groups – under 18 and under 30. The winner of each category receives a £250 prize and a certificate – which is traditionally drawn on and signed by the judges. Entrants are asked to submit one original cartoon, in colour or black and white, drawn freehand to a maximum size of A4. Entries must be submitted by November 10 to The Young Cartoonists of the Year Competition, The Cartoon Museum, 35 Little Russell Street, London, WC1A 2HH.

"Alan Irvine will sit down with England’s newest senior recruit on Friday and remind Saido Berahino of his responsibilities. West Brom manager and striker have formed a close bond since the Scot’s arrival at The Hawthorns following Berahino’s turbulent breakthrough season. The in-form forward has responded with eight goals for Albion and appears to have turned over a new leaf after a series of incidents last year. West Brom manager Alan Irvine (right) and Saido Berahino (left) have formed a close bond working together . England manager Roy Hodgson named Berahino in his squad for the Euro 2016 qualifier against Slovenia . ‘He had some highs and some big lows,’ admitted Irvine. I think he’s learned there have been people who can help him and that includes himself and his family. ‘I’ve had a few chats with him and I’ll have another one with him tomorrow, first of all to congratulate him. I’ll make him aware of the potential pitfalls. ‘It can have an adverse effect if it’s not handled properly. I think he’s got an understanding of how he should behave. I can’t complain about anything he’s done so far.’ Berahino burst on to the scene in 2013, scoring a hat-trick for West Brom in the League Cup against Newport. The kid who fled war-torn Burundi as a refugee was suddenly an £850-a-week, headline-making star and it appeared he was struggling to handle the fame. A £40,000-a-week contract was signed and Berahino was pictured in a large 4x4, supposedly spotted canoodling with an ex-girlfriend of Ashley Cole’s, and finally inhaling ‘hippy crack’. By the end of the season he was struggling to persuade Pepe Mel that he was worth a place in the starting line-up and there was talk of dressing-room clashes. The most public one was with James Morrison after the youngster casually lost possession in the 3-3 draw with Cardiff which led to an equalising goal. The 21-year-old scores from the penalty spot for the Under 21s against Croatia in October . Berahino has scored 10 goals in 13 appearances for Gareth Southgates Under 21s . A change of agent and a change of attitude saw Berahino start pre-season training early and he has never looked back. Irvine added: ‘It’s a fantastic achievement to get a call-up so early. I’ve had a few chats with him and told him that if he keeps on doing what he does on the training ground and living his life as he does then good things can happen. ‘I have to say I didn’t think such a good thing would happen so quickly. It can come too quickly if they don’t handle the occasion properly and don’t keep their feet on the ground. ‘We’ll try and help him as far as that’s concerned. Hopefully he’ll understand that and it is vitally important he realises this is a reward for what he’s done so far. As long as he doesn’t change the reward can continue. ‘His profile is now bigger which is great but it also makes life more difficult for him. Everyone is expecting him to star in every game and that adds to the press we’ll try to help him cope with that. ‘He’s becoming a better player week by week. That’s down to how he lives his life and goes about his training. Good things will happen if he keeps doing these things. ‘There’s always a bit of fear that young players can’t cope with everything that happens off the pitch. It’s vitally important we help him as much as we can.’ Berahino gave an interview recently which showed how much he has grown up. He is a committed Christian and religion now plays a big part in his life. He said: ‘You get caught up in this world, you want to do certain things that really don’t have a value. I am not perfect, I will never say I am perfect or the best Christian, but I try. ‘People out there will ask how can I be a religious person, look at the amount of stuff I did in the past. At the end of the day, you get judged for what you do in the past. ‘I try to be the best I can be, it is not easy. I just try every day and see where it takes me.’","Saido Berahino was named in Roy Hodgson's England squad on Thursday .

"The couple from Pennsylvania, who created a bucket list for their unborn son, says the Facebook page dedicated to their journey has been hacked and flooded with abusive messages. Dan and Jenna Haley from Upper Darby were devastated when 13 weeks into the pregnancy, their baby-to-be was diagnosed with a neural tube defect called anencephaly, which is the absence of part of the brain and skull. They decided to chronicle their journey and created a Facebook page in order to make the most of their time with their  son Shane who was born last Thursday morning and died just three hours later. Adding to the couples grief, relatives say someone hacked into the page on Saturday afternoon and posted explicit images. Jenna Gassew and Dan Haley from Upper Darby, Pennsylvania, created a bucket list for their unborn son and say the Facebook page dedicated to their journey was hacked. Relatives say someone hacked into their Facebook page on Saturday afternoon and posted explicit images . Mom, Jenna, was very upset and was worried that she would lose the memories posted on the page but Facebook has managed to restore the tribute . Miraculous: Shane Michael Haley was born on Thursday morning, and his family were all there to meet him and witness him being baptized into the Catholic faith. Four hours after his birth, he died in his mother's arms . Jenna's father said that his daughter was very upset and was worried that she would lose the memories posted on the page. However by 5pm yesterday afternoon, the photos were removed and the page appeared to be back to normal. Despite Shane's slim chances of survival, the devout Catholics decided to make the most of the pregnancy and birth, even compiling a 'bucket list' of activities to complete while he was still in the womb. Shane Michael Haley was born early on Thursday morning, and his family members were all there to meet him and witness him being baptized into the Catholic faith. But at 6:15am Thursday morning, just four hours after his birth, Shane died 'peacefully in his mother's arms,' according to a post on Facebook. 'Shane spent his entire life in the arms of people that loved him unconditionally, and I don't think you could ask for a more beautiful life then that,' reads the tragic post. 'He is home now with the Lord and will forever be our little miracle!' Tragic: The couple shared a bittersweet moment last Thursday when they welcomed their son Shane, who lived just a few hours before dying in their arms . Proud parents: Even after learning that Shane would likely not survive very long, Dan and Jenna continued to prepare for his birth and celebrate his existence . Have hope: 'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing,' Dan wrote on Facebook prior to Shane's birth . Adventures: The couple even compiled a 'bucket list' of activities to complete while he was still in the womb . The couple shared pictures of Shane's brief life, including one of him being cradled in his mother's arms. In another photo, Shane is surrounded with stuffed animals and blankets, his tiny hands clutching onto a holy Rosary. Babies born with anencephaly, which occurs in one or two of every 10,000 births, have a life expectancy of a few hours to a few days, with a few cases where children have survived for more than a year. For tragic Shane, life was just a few hours, but his parents made sure to celebrate him as much as possible while they could. Illness: 13 weeks into Jenna's pregnancy, Shane baby-to-be was diagnosed with a neural tube defect called anencephaly, which is the absence of part of the brain and skull . Arts and crafts: They painted Jenna's baby bump to look like a Jack-o'-lantern, knowing that Shane might never live to celebrate Halloween . Support: The couple documented all their adventures on a Facebook page, Prayers For Shane, where friends were invited to share their support and blessings. It has more than 700,000 'likes' Milestones: Jenna celebrated her first Mother's Day while still pregnant with Shane . Making the most: 'We knew that our time with our son could be very limited, so we wanted to make the most of the time that we had with him,' says Dan . As part of their bucket list before Shane was born, Dan and Jenna, who are in their early 20s, took him to baseball games, brought him on a tour of New York City and painted Jenna's baby bump to look like a Jack-o'-lantern. Anencephaly occurs between the third and fourth weeks of pregnancy. During that time, the neural tube is supposed to close and fold over to form the brain and spinal cord of the fetus. This process fails to occur in anencephalic pregnancies, resulting in the absence of a large portion of the brain, skull and scalp. Babies born with anencephaly are usually blind, deaf, unconcious and unable to feel pain. They are usually stillborn but in rare cases they may survive longer. The rate of anencephaly is one or two per 10,000 births. 'We are asking for your prayers and support and that God grants us as much time as possible with our beautiful son,' reads the page. The couple documented all their adventures on a Facebook page, Prayers For Shane, where friends were invited to share their support and blessings. It has more than 700,000 'likes'. 'Shane has already proven to us that each day must be lived to the fullest and that is exactly what our little family is doing. Follow us through our various adventures as we take Shane to some of our favorite childhood places.' Thousands of people pored out support for Jenna and Dan throughout the pregnancy and birth. One person wrote: 'Please read Psalm 139 - Shane is being knit together in your womb and God makes no mistakes. We were created to glorify Him. Little Shane is doing that. He's being used to cause many people to pray!!!' Others describe instances in which babies have miraculously lived for years despite being born with terminal defects. Dan announced Shane's birth via the Facebook page, writing: 'Baby Shane is here!! .. Mom and Baby are doing well! .. more details and pictures to come!' The post has had more than 115,000 'likes'.

"A 'besotted' female prison officer struck up a sexual relationship with an inmate and smuggled drugs, booze and mobile phones into jail after falling in love with him, a court heard. Hannah Stewart, 28, fell head over heels for Andrelle Leedham, 26, and wrote him love letters while working at HMP Featherstone, near Wolverhampton. Stafford Crown Court heard the pair met in the education department of the prison shortly before he was released on August 23 last year. Relationship: Hannah Stewart is accused of having sex with Andrelle Leedham, pictured above outside Stafford Crown Court, while working as an officer at HMP Featherstone . After falling for each other the couple then started having regular sex together - a relationship prohibited by the terms of her job, jurors were told. Leedham is accused of then convincing his new lover to smuggle a package into the Staffordshire prison containing mobile phones, drugs and alcohol. On Tuesday Leedham, from Blakenhall, West Midlands, went on trial charged with conspiracy to supply drugs between March 1 2012 and November 23 last year. Prosecutor Gerard Quirke told the court: 'He [Leedham] is the man responsible for creating this plot using the woman prison officer he had round his little finger. 'He showed her a lot of attention, commenting on her looks and exercising the charm he undoubtedly has. 'She was in effect guarding him and knew she should not discuss things of a personal nature with him. Also on trial: Leedham, 26, from the West Midlands, is accused of convincing Ms Stewart to smuggle a package into the Staffordshire prison - containing mobile phones, drugs and alcohol . 'But regrettably she did and developed affectionate feelings towards him. She was twisted round his little finger.' The court heard on November 21 last year, Stewart picked up the contraband from the home of Leedham's mother before travelling to the prison for work the next day. She concealed the package - contain seven mobile phones, cannabis, anabolic steroids, whiskey and vodka - inside a sports bag she normally carried her lunch in. The jury heard Stewart hid the bag in a cupboard in the education department where she was passed a message from Leedham by lag Christopher Lewis. Controlling: The prosecution say Leedham is responsible for the smuggling plot and had Ms Stewart 'round his little finger' The 38-year-old told her to wait and give the package to another inmate Ricardo Edwards,31, who approached her shortly after and asked: 'Is that for me?' Mr Quirke added: 'A prison officer became suspicious after seeing the exchange and followed Edwards and Lewis down a corridor as they left the education department. 'When approached they made a run for it and Edwards threw away the package, which had been hidden in his clothing.' Edwards and Lewis were detained and the package was recovered, which was found to have Leedham's fingerprints on, the jury heard. Giving evidence yesterday, Stewart, from Featherstone, Stafforshire, said Leedham had prepared the package and organised for the inmate to take it from her. She also told the court how she had succumbed to his charm and fell for the inmate while he was still a prisoner. She said: 'He made me feel good about myself. He told me I was attractive, that he would like to get to know me and one day would have me. 'At first I just ignored him but he continued to say how beautiful I was, how he had feelings for me and wanted to be with me when he got out. 'I believed him. I should have reported him but did not. I had started to like him. 'I wrote the letter to him the week before he was released and it accurately reflected my feelings towards him.' The letter telling of her affections was written shortly before Leedham's release and was read out to the court. It said: 'My gorgeous baby. I don't know where to start. It feels like a dream to have someone as sexy as you who actually wants me. I have fallen for you and there is no going back. 'I admit that I seriously love you. I really hope you think the same and it would certainly hurt me if you did not. We will be good together. Pledge: While working at HMP Featherstone, above, Ms Stewart wrote to Leedham: 'I admit that I seriously love you. I really hope you think the same and it would certainly hurt me if you did not. We will be good together' 'I have butterflies in my stomach when I see you and when you kiss me I go weak at the knees. I can't wait until Friday when I can talk to you all the time and we can do what we want when we want.' Stewart has already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to supply cannabis and anabolic steroids as well as misconduct in a public office. She denies having sex with Leedham in jail and said the fling had finished by the end of September. Lewis and Edwards have previously admitted conspiracy to supply cannabis and anabolic steroids. Leedham denies conspiracy to supply drugs and conveying prohibited articles to HMP Featherstone. Oliver Woolhouse, defending, told Stewart: 'Andrelle Leedham was not involved at all. You have used him as a scapegoat.' The case continues. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Hannah Stewart, 28, was an officer at HMP Featherstone in Staffordshire .

"The sister of a trainee nurse who died in a hen party crash has blamed the 'idiotic actions' of their minibus driver for taking away her 'best friend'. Amy Firth, 26, was one of 20 women travelling to the hen party in Liverpool when their minibus was hit on the M62 in West Yorkshire by an articulated lorry. Her 18-year-old sister Bethany Jones was killed, while bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, were among several others injured. Amy Firth, pictured left at her sister's funeral, told Leeds Crown Court she had lost her sister and best friend Bethany Jones, right, because of the 'idiotic actions' of a minibus driver  taking them to a hen party in Liverpool . Today, in a statement read to a jury at Leeds Crown Court, Ms Firth told the jury she believed bus driver James Johnson caused the incident. His 24-seat Mercedes minibus began showing signs of mechanical error due to a burnt-out clutch just minutes into the hen party journey on April 26 last year, the court heard. She said: 'That short journey changed my life and that of my family. My sister and best friend Beth was taken from me by the idiotic actions of that minibus driver.' The jury heard how the group left from South Elmsall, West Yorkshire, for a weekend in Liverpool ahead of the wedding. As soon as the minibus got on to the A1, the group started to smell burning. They forced the driver to stop to check his vehicle. Mr Johnson,64, stopped in a lay by on the A1 before they got onto the motorway, but he set off again after a cursory check, the court heard. By the time the minibus had moved on to the M62 it slowed to a crawl, the court was told. Ms Firth said the minibus driver 'should never have carried on driving' with the vehicle in that condition. She described in her statement how other vehicles were honking their horns at them because the bus was going so slow. The women asked the minibus driver to pull over after smelling burning, but he carried on with the journey after a cursory check and began crawling at no more than 5mph on the M62, the court heard . Other vehicles avoided colliding with the minibus but Kevin Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus, Leeds Crown Court heard . Other vehicles avoided colliding with the coach but Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus, the court was told. Ms Firth said: 'I knew the speed on the motorway was dangerous. 'The next thing I remember was waking up and the bus being laid on its side. 'I started shouting ""our Beth"". I continued shouting ""our Beth"" but got no reply. I was shouting to mum, ""I can't hear our Beth"".' She said she was 'crying and screaming' at the time. Her mother, Diane Jones, told the court in a statement how the hen party revellers were 'laughing and joking' and were 'very excited' before they set off. Lorry driver Kevin Ollerhead, left, denies causing Mrs Jones's death. James Johnson, right, who was driving the hen party's minibus, has pleaded guilty to causing death by dangerous driving . Mrs Jones said she heard a sound she would 'describe as an explosion' while on the M62. She said she was trapped inside the stricken minibus and could hear daughter Amy shouting. She could not hear Bethany. The court also heard from several other passengers, one of whom told the jury: 'I think he stopped and got out to stop us nagging.' Mr Johnson from Wyke, Bradford, pleaded guilty to causing Miss Jones's death by dangerous driving at an earlier hearing, the jury has heard. Bride-to-be Stefanie Firth, 24, was among those who were seriously injured . Truck driver Kevin Ollerhead, 45, from St Helens, Merseyside, is on trial charged with the same offence. He denies causing death by dangerous driving. Bryan Cox QC, opening the case for the prosecution yesterday, told the jury of eight women and four men that the collision happened after the 24-seater coach suffered mechanical problems and came to a 'near standstill' on the motorway. Other vehicles avoided the coach but Ollerhead, who was driving the lorry on a cruise control set to 52mph, drove straight into the back of the bus. It shunted it 50 yards along the road where it careered into a crash barrier, the court heard. Mr Cox told the jury the speed of the coach gradually reduced to a 'snail's pace' until it was travelling at just 5.5mph in the nearside lane of the M62, just after junction 32, near Pontefract. The prosecution claimed that even thought his articulated lorry was on the speed limiter, he still had around six seconds to see the stricken bus in front of him, after several other vehicles had overtaken it. The jury was told that there were no indications that he had either braked or tried to steer away from the coach as he travelled towards it in the motorway's inside lane at 52 mph. Johnson will be sentenced following Ollerhead's trial, which is expected to last ten days. The trial continues.

"A teenager who suffered serious brain damage when his bicycle was hit by van has given his first ever TV interview. Ryan Smith, 17, was left in a coma and fighting for his life after he decided not to wear a helmet for fear it would ruin his hairstyle. The teenager, from Chapel St Leonards in Lincolnshire, appeared today on ITV’s This Morning with his father to talk about the progress he has made. Ryan Smith, 17, told ITV's This Morning  he had 'come on leaps and bounds' since coming out of a four month coma in November following a crash with a van while cycling . After the accident on July 22 2013, Ryan's family released a heartbreaking picture of Ryan's father Mark cradling his son's head - in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets . Ryan defied doctors who said he would never wake from the coma, and wouldn't ever be able to speak or walk . Mark Smith said that his son was now back at school, where he achieved an A in his GCSE maths. 'The school has learnt that cognitively, he is still in there. It is just a process of plucking it out,' he said. He is now campaigning for a change in the law to make wearing a cycle helmet compulsory, which he says will save other families the pain of the ordeal he has been through. Beginning the interview, presenter Ruth Langsford said she ‘nearly cried’ when she went to meet Mr Smith before the show. ‘The last time we saw you Mark, you were crying,’ she said, of Mr Smith's last appearance on the show in August, a month after Ryan's accident. She asked Ryan, who sat hand in hand with his father on the show’s red sofa, how he was feeling today and what he can remember from the accident. Needing prompting and encouragement from his father, Ryan said: ‘Children’s Trust. Rehab. Swimming.’ Mss Langsford then joked that as she came into the make-up studio where Ryan was being prepared before the show, she caught him up to his old tricks: doing his hair. Ryan was in a coma for four months following the accident, which happened on July 22 2013. Presenter Ruth Langsford (with co-presenter Eamonn Holmes) said she ‘nearly cried’ when she went to meet Mr Smith and Ryan before the show . Ryan's father Mark Smith is now campaigning for a change in the law making it compulsory for all cyclists to wear helmets . At the time, his family released a heart-breaking image showing Ryan’s father, Mark, cradling his son’s head as he lay unconscious in a hospital bed - in the hope it would encourage other cyclists to wear helmets. Then, in November, the family were overjoyed when Ryan spoke for the first time. And in April, Ryan defied doctors to stand unaided at the Children’s Trust’s Tadworth rehabilitation unit in Surrey. July 2013: Ryan is left in a coma after being hit by a van when cycling . November 2013: Ryan wakes up from a four month coma and says ‘Hello dad.. Hello mum.’ April 2014: Ryan stands up unaided for the first time . October 2014: Ryan and his father appear on ITV’s This Morning, giving their first TV interview since the accident . Speaking today about his son’s injuries, Mark Smith said: 'Unfortunately these sorts of injuries are life-long. Ryan’s doing really well but he’s got a long way to go yet. ‘The left side side’s extremely weak still. He’s had operations on his feet to get a better angle on his feet to help him with walking. ‘He’s left the Children’s Trust and now he’s back at school, he’s getting therapy there.’ Mr Smith said: ‘The school is starting to learn that cognitively, he’s still in there, and it’s a process now of plucking it out and encouraging him to do the things he can do.' He added that Ryan’s friends have been integral in his recovery, coming to visit him every week. ‘Since we’ve been home, it’s not just about family all the time, and therapists. ‘It’s about his friends. He’s trying to emulate them again. 'His determination has shone through since he’s been home so we’ll just keep working with that. Ryan received rehabilitation at the Children’s Trust’s in Tadworth, Surrey but has now gone back to school where he is receiving therapy. In April this year, Ryan's was able to stand unaided for the first time. ‘And his friends have been tremendous. And that’s what he needs.’ 'I've come on leaps and bounds,' Ryan added. Mr Smith said he never expected to be sitting on the show’s sofa, as before his last appearance on the show in August doctors had warned that Ryan might never wake up. Mr Smith said: 'At that time it was touch and go. There’s no two ways about it. We were going through hell at that time. ‘But its mixed emotions now as you can see, look at him again now. 'At the time I never dreamt I’d be sat with you here, especially with the main man. So its testament to Ryan’s character, that is.’ His son has defied medics with his progress, he added. He said: ‘Prognosis from day one was that he wasn’t expected to be here. ‘We were supposed to prepare for demise. Then we were told he wasn’t going to be able to do anything again. Presenters Eamonn Holmes and Ruth Langsford said they hoped next time they saw Ryan, he would walk into the studio . ‘He’s stuck two fingers up to quite a few prognosis. And long may that continue.’ Cycle helmets are not compulsory in Britain, so Mr Smith will continue his campaign for this law to be changed. Olympic champion and Tour de France winner Sir Bradley Wiggins has also backed calls for legislation to force cyclists to wear them on roads. Department of Transport research shows up to 16 per cent of cycling deaths could be avoided if cyclists were wearing the correct helmet. Mr Smith said: ‘Why take the risk? You’re very exposed on one of those bikes. 'If you put a helmet on it will minimise any impacts that should you sustain them, you won’t put your family through what we’ve been through.’","Ryan Smith, 17, was knocked off his bike on July 22, 2013 .

"An ugly feud over an $8billion fortune amassed by the family who control the Orkin pest control empire is set to come to a head in a bitter court battle. The grandchildren of company founder Wayne Rollins, who went from rural poverty in Depression-era Georgia to owning America's biggest extermination firm, have rounded on their father and uncle, who now control the company. The four children of Gary Rollins, the CEO of Rollins Inc., which owns all of Orkin's 400 locations and nine other pest control businesses - are suing him and his brother Randall over their inheritance. Scroll down for video . Feud: Gary Rollins (left and right), former COO of Rollins, Inc., has launched a legal battle with his siblings against their father and uncle - whom they say is imposing draconian conditions on their inheritance . Feud: Randall Rollins, left, and Gary Rollins, right, are accused of depriving their children and nephews of their rightful inheritance . The suit has been brought by Glen Rollins, 45, his brother Wayne and two sisters, Ruth Ellen and Nancy Louise, according to a report by Forbes magazine, with the latest chapter is set to unfold in 2015. Glen Rollins, who spent years at Rollins Inc. and was COO until being fired, told Forbes the lawsuit is an attempt to escape a family 'cult' which wants to hire private investigators and conduct drugs tests on young younger generations before they are allowed their inheritance. He said: 'We’d put up with a lot. We didn’t want to have our kids and grandkids go through that, or worse. We were unwilling to have them rule from the grave.' Together, the claimants allege that the elder generation has deprived them of their rightful inheritance via a web of trust funds with arcane and intrusive eligibility requirements. All of the Rollins grandchildren - there are another five on Randall's side of the family - had trust funds started for them by Wayne Rollins, who died in 1991. Patriarch: Wayne Rollins, pictured, started the family business which is now worth billions. He died in 1991 . The Orkin pest control business was started in 1901 by Latvian immigrant Otto Orkin, but the Rollins family bought it out in 1967 and have controlled it via Rollins Inc. ever since. In Wayne's lifetime the company grew hugely, and when he died it was worth billions with an organized plan for distributing the money to the next generation. But in 2000, Gary and Randall imposed new requirements on the funds, requiring their children to complete 'meaningful activity' such as work or education to qualify for annual payments in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. All the grandchildren accepted the regime - and many failed the tests over the years to come so missed out on millions of dollars. But the younger generation was outraged when in 2010 the two elder Rollins men tried to impose a new set of conditions on the payments. This included a 'monitoring program' which allowed the men to hire private investigators, access medial records and make credit and drugs tests in order to ensure the children met the criteria. Outraged, Gary's four children hired lawyers and have dragged the family through numerous court battles without resolving the dispute. Path to riches: Randall Rollins (left) and founder Wayne Rollins (right) are seen in 1968, when Rollins, Inc. began trading on the New York Stock Exchange . Randall's five children did not join in - but the litigant Rollins members allege their five cousins were paid off with $9million as a reward for not complaining. The feud has split the family apart - Glen has divorced his wife, the two sets of cousins no longer speak and Gary Rollins, now 70, reportedly celebrated his recent remarriage with none of his children present. Lawyers for Garry and Randall Rollins said: 'The plaintiffs’ lawsuits are motivated by greed and self-interest'. According to court papers, Randall's five children submitted supporting statements describing the litigant children as a 'disgruntled and diminishing minority of family members' who are violating their grandfather's intentions. The children's suit has made its way through county and appeal courts in Georgia, and had a hearing at the Georgia Supreme Court in January of this year. The next stage is reportedly due to take place in 2015.","Rollins family controls Orkin pest control and is worth billions of dollars .

"The Liberal Democrats have stopped the Government from ‘really delivering’ on immigration reform, David Cameron claimed today. The Prime Minister said he needed a Tory majority after the next election because he had not been able to ‘go ahead with all the things we wanted to do’. Mr Cameron’s remarks come after he pledged to make reform of European freedom of movement rules the centrepiece of his Brussels renegotiation if he wins the next election. David Cameron (centre) with the Tory candidate for Rochester and Strood Kelly Tolhurst (left) were shown around the Crossrail site in Chatham, Kent, by site manager Michael O'Neil yesterday . The PM claimed he had already restricted the benefits migrants could claim – but admitted further reform would be ‘tough’. Speaking to Radio Kent this morning, ahead of the crunch November 20 Rochester and Strood by-election, Mr Cameron said: ‘I believe at the next election I’ve got a very strong case to say you’ve seen what we’ve done in Coalition, having to make some compromises, not being able to go ahead with all the things we wanted to do – now give us the chance to really deliver for the country, including on issues like immigration.’ Mr Cameron said freedom of movement within the EU was not ‘an unqualified right’. He said: ‘You can’t come here and immediately claim benefits. We’ve said that if you come here and claim benefits, that after six months you should go home. We’ve said that if you come here and you can’t support yourself and you’re begging on the streets you should return to the country you came from.’ Mr Cameron added: ‘We’ve already made qualifications, but my view is that there is a lot more we can do to make sure that we properly control immigration into our country, both from outside the European Union, where we’ve cut migration quite substantially under this government, but we also need to take steps with Europe as well. ‘As far as I’m concerned the British public are the boss, they’ve made it very clear they want this issue sorted out, and that’s exactly what I want to do.’ Angela Merkel has allegedly vetoed a proposal to cap the number of migrants allowed Britain every year . The Prime Minister insisted the German Chancellor Angela Merkel shared some of his concerns about immigration – amid claims she had vetoed plans to put a cap on the number of migrants allowed into Britain each year. He said: ‘I’ve had good conversations with Angela Merkel about this, and she’s talked about the issues they’ve had in Germany with the problems of migration and particularly this issue of people being able to claim benefits. ‘So look, of course we’re not all instantly going to agree, and of course this will be a tough negotiation, but the point I’d make is look, you’ve got one leader, David Cameron, the Conservative party…who have a very clear view that we need to have a renegotiation and then a referendum on Europe. ‘We have a plan to bring our immigration under control, and I don’t hear that plan either from Labour or the Liberal Democrats or indeed Ukip. Because of course if you vote Ukip you probably end up with a Labour government and no immigration control at all.' Far right leader Marine Le Pen used Mr Cameron's struggle to control immigration as an 'example' of why France should leave the EU . Miss Le Pen wrote: 'We are not free to decide our immigration policy and the example of Mr Cameron recently proved' Mr Cameron said he wanted to change Britain's relationship with Europe. He said: 'I don’t want a referendum today because I’m not satisfied with the way Europe is working today. ‘But I believe that if you put forward a strong case for renegotiation, hold that renegotiation, get a better deal, we can address issues like immigration. ‘In the end, it’s not going to be my decision whether Britain stays or leaves the European Union. ‘I’m a positive person, I want to put a positive approach to this which is to get the changes we need, but in the end it will be for the people of Britain, the people of Rochester and Strood to decide to stay in on these new terms or leave.’ He dismissed a suggestion that the Tories should make an election pact with Ukip to shore up support in marginal consituencies. ‘I don’t believe in deals and pacts. The next election is absolutely wide open, and it could easily result, if people vote the right way, in a Conservative-only government. ‘That’s what I’m campaigning for and nothing’s going to distract me between now and then. ‘People know with me that I will always try and do the right thing for Britain.’","PM said a Tory majority was needed to overhaul Brussels migration rules .

"Small community newspapers, charities, think-tanks and even the Mumsnet parenting website could be hit with massive damages unless they sign up to the Government’s Royal Charter on Press regulation. A leading freedom of expression charity highlighted the potential threat after a detailed study of controversial legislation which will curb the freedom of the Press. In a major report, English PEN said the measures would have a ‘chilling’ effect on free speech. Mumsnet, which publishes news-related material, could fall under the legal definition of 'relevant publisher', which means it must sign up to the press regulation Royal Charter of face huge damages in libel cases . It warned that rather than being exempt from the laws, as the Government intended, tiny newspapers, campaign groups and political parties would be caught by them – while, incredibly, the sprawling BBC website (which is not regulated by Ofcom) would not. Under the Royal Charter, so-called ‘relevant publishers’ must sign up to the new Parliament-approved Press Regulation Panel. Publications that refuse to comply face exemplary damages in libel cases. Newspapers and magazines have refused to sign up, fearing it would bring an end to 300 years of Press freedom. Ministers insisted charities, not-for-profit community newspapers, specialist publications and political organisations would not need to join the regulator. But the ‘poorly defined’ legislation means some of those organisations may actually fall into the category of ‘relevant publisher’, says English PEN. These include Amnesty International UK, which is made up of charities and registered companies, Decanter, a magazine for wine buffs which carries news and Mumsnet, which publishes news-related material. Incredibly, the sprawling BBC website (which is not regulated by Ofcom) would not be caught by the new rules . Jo Glanville, director of English PEN, said: ‘Our analysis reveals a worrying level of uncertainty regarding the definition of “relevant publisher”.’ A spokesman for the Free Speech Network campaign group said: ‘It is particularly alarming to learn these draconian measures could apply – at crippling cost – to community newspapers and websites, blogs and hobby magazines, while a vast news operation like the BBC website is exempt.’ The Royal Charter was agreed between the three main political parties and Hacked Off after the Leveson Inquiry recommended ‘voluntary, independent self-regulation’. The Independent Press Standards Organisation, which oversees the majority of newspapers including the Daily Mail and can impose £1million fines for serious and systemic wrongdoing, has said it will not seek recognition under the Charter.","English PEN highlights potential threat after studying proposed legislation .

"A fortnight ago, Tony Romo chipped two vertebrae. Now he looks set to play at Wembley. The Dallas Cowboys (6-3) are desperate to arrest a two-game losing streak and will risk their divisive quarterback against the Jacksonville Jaguars. The 34-year-old, equally famed for thrilling fourth-quarter comebacks as he is for disastrous interceptions, has been told in no uncertain terms that he will return at the expense of back-up Brandon Weeden. Charismatic owner Jerry Jones made that clear before leaving for England, while at Saracens’ Allianz Park on Friday head coach Jason Garrett said: ‘He looked pretty comfortable to me.’ Tony Romo speaks to fans during the NFL fan rally at Wembley ahead of the 11th International Series game . A heavily padded Romo throws during training on Friday with the Cowboys quarterback expected to play . Romo has a history of playing through the pain, and in 2011 managed to do so against the San Francisco 49ers with a punctured lung and a broken rib. He won the game, too. But the injury is a notoriously painful one. Romo will be heavily padded and will struggle with mobility if he does suit up, . The Cowboys won’t want him to get hit, so expect their vaunted offensive line and the NFL’s leading rusher, DeMarco Murray to protect him. Murray became the first player to rush for 100 yards in each of the first seven games of the season. The bruising running back has 1,133 yards from 225 carries, and with the rejuvenating bye week to come, can expect a greater workload against a weak Jaguars run defense. Romo has thrown a touchdown pass in 36 consecutive games and Dez Bryant will want to get back into form after a quiet few weeks. DeMarco Murray leads the NFL in rushing yards and should feature heavily against the Jaguars . Dez Bryant will hope to wow the crowd with the wideout looking to return to form after two quiet games . The acrobatic wide receiver said he has ‘a little bit of extra juice’ since landing in England, so get set for fireworks as the Cowboys aim to reach the playoffs for the first time since 2009. Meanwhile, are the Jaguars as bad as their 1-8 record suggests? In a word, yes. The NFL’s youngest team, they possess an admirable head coach in the shape of Gus Bradley. But they will need to address points conceded (27.9) and yards per game (386.9) to trouble the W column. They are good at hassling the quarterback, however. And with 27 sacks - joint third in the NFL - their front seven are capable of making life difficult for Romo. In Blake Bortles, the third overall pick of this year’s draft, they have a rookie quarterback who has drawn comparisons with Ben Roethlisberger. But he is prone to errors of judgement and leads the NFL in interceptions with 13. Blake Bortles has made some rookie mistakes this season, but he is being backed to turn it around long-term . Denard Robinson has been a quarterback, wide receiver and a cornerback before settling as a running back . Bortles has some exciting weapons in the shape of Cecil Shorts III and undrafted rookie Allen Hurns, who hauled in seven passes for 117 yards, scoring two touchdowns in last week’s 22-23 defeat to the Cincinnati Bengals. And then there’s running back Denard ‘Shoelace’ Robinson, so called because he doesn’t tie them up. He will spearhead the ground game after averaging over 100 yards for the past three matches. On paper, the Cowboys win. But on Wembley’s hybrid grass, will the Jaguars make the Cowboys regret their decision to risk Romo?","Romo suffered two chipped vertebrae but is set to take the snaps at Wembley .

"An architect drew up a 'price list' for fellow inmates he approached in prison about harming his wife and killing her and his children, a court heard. The list included £8,000 for killing his wife Heather McGarry and £500 for setting fire to their matrimonial home.The price increased to £50,000 if they managed to kill his wife, their children and Mrs McGarry's friend. Andrew McGarry, 39, was already serving a long sentence in prison for ramming a car into his matrimonial home and then setting it on fire - but had still decided to wage a 'reign of terror' upon his 28-year-old wife, Bolton Crown Court heard. Scroll down for video . Andrew McGarry was serving time in prison for ramming his car into his wife's home in Bolton and setting fire to it when he drew up a 'price list' he gave to two inmates with details of how he wanted her to be harmed . Andrew McGarry, an architect, is accused of handing the 'price list' to inmates at  Forest Bank Prison . The court heard he even dished out detailed floor plans of the family home, detailing the layout of the rooms, the location of valuable property and even the alarm code. He later gave an inmate his wife's parents address and said he wanted revenge as it was a year to the day after they had complained to police about him, it is alleged. McGarry, a father of three, approached two inmates with a list of payouts for varying degrees of attacks which could be carried out on his former wife and their next door neighbour named as Andrea, and make it look like a burglary. The list included £100 for causing damage to the windows at both addressees, £500 for setting fire to the matrimonial home, and £8,000 for killing his wife. One of McGarry's lists read 'If you get Heather herself £8,000 and if you get Andrea, £1,400' claiming he had the money in a trust fund and said the fee would increase to £50,000 if both were killed along with his children. Police were called in after one of the inmates handed over details of McGarry's plans to guards at Forest Bank Jail in Salford, the jury was told. The jury was played CCTV footage which showed McGarry ramming his car into his wife's home in Bolton . The court heard McGarry had previously ploughed his Vauxhall Zafira into his £120,000 end-terraced house after the breakdown of his marriage. He had married Heather in August 2006 and the couple had three children Lewis, eight, Lacey, six and Elliott, four. But she described him as 'a Jekyll and Hyde type personality' in the course of their marriage. The court heard there was domestic violence by him and she was granted a non molestation order on 14 June 2012 for one year - a form of a restraining order. She filed for divorce in July 2012. However on July 24 that year dramatic CCTV pictures from cameras, installed by McGarry himself and shown to the jury, captured the moment the blue hatchback clattered into the front garden and then into the house before the vehicle burst into flames. Neil Fryman, prosecuting, said just a month after McGarry was sentenced in February 2013 he befriended fellow inmate James Plaice and told him the reasons he had been sent to prison. Then just a few weeks later he started asking if he knew anybody who would be willing to 'do damage' to his house where his wife was still living. The car is shown on the footage (left) being rammed into the house, and then bursting into flames. It then set fire to the house, causing a lot of damage to the end terrace home in Bolton where Mrs McGarry was living . Mr Fryman added: 'He explained he wanted damage caused at the windows of the property in order to force her out. Not content with what he had done, he wanted further damage. He offered to pay James Plaice cash if he arranged someone on the outside to do it. James Plaice was provided with the address and played along with this and said would carry out when he had no intention of doing so.' Days later the pair met again and McGarry gave Plaice tobacco in payment, seemingly accepting damage had been done to his wife's home. The conversations that escalated and McGarry told his fellow inmate he wanted someone to break into the house and steal items of property and then to set the house on fire. Mr Fryman said: 'He told James Plaice if he couldn't have the house then nobody could. He went see him in his cell and handed him detailed plans of the house, showing the layout of the house and the location of valuable property and coloured pictures of his house retained from the court case. 'He told James Plaice he would pay him about £2,000 if he arranged for the house to be set on fire. He went on to explain that items of property could be stolen as payment.' The court heard McGarry gave Plaice details of his alarm code and code for the safe. He said he wasn't bothered if his wife was in the property if it set on fire. However he did tell of specific days his children would not be there. Mr Fryman added: 'James Plaice played along saying he wanted a Playstation console. James Plaice became increasingly concerned that he was intent in getting someone to set fire to the house and getting his wife harmed. He played along but realised McGarry's wife was in real danger.' Mrs McGarry's home in Bolton was left badly damaged after Mr McGarry rammed his car into the house . Mr McGarry allegedly told an inmate he also wanted revenge on his wife's parents and wanted a fire arranged . Plaice later told another inmate Colin Brady about the plot and handed him the plans and paperwork. Brady later approached McGarry to ask him what he wanted. McGarry told him 'a reign of terror on both my ex-wife and her next door neighbour'. Mr Fryman added: 'He said to Colin Brady that he wanted his ex-wife dead and wasn't bothered how it was done or who got in there. Colin Brady led him to believe that he would sort it out and carry out the plans. He asked him to write down what he wanted doing. 'He wrote down addresses and a list of what he wanted doing and the price he would pay him. Brady took the paper and passed it to a prison officer because he was so concerned, the jury heard. Mr Fryman told the court 'Colin Brady handed to the police the plans and paperwork along with the list of prices that he had received. 'If you get heather herself £8,000 and if you get Andrea £1,400.' The prosecution say these were very detailed plans and when one compares and contrasts to 24th July they are very determined plans where the defendant meant business.' McGarry continued to approach Brady, unaware the police were investigating him. Last March he told Brady it was coming up to the first anniversary of the day Heather's parents went to police to complain about him. 'He said the date was 31st May and as a result he wanted Heather's parents' house damaging and their cars setting alight,' said Mr Fryman. 'He handed to Colin Brady a piece of paper with Heather's parents' address in Rochdale and a hand drawn map. McGarry told Colin Brady that he now wanted as many windows as possible breaking at heather's house and drew a sketch.' But on April 3 McGarry spoke to Brady again and said he now wanted his wife, children and his wife's neighbour all dead and wanted someone to arrange a fire. Mr Fryman said:  'He asked to arrange a fire at Heather's address as soon as he could and said he would pay him an increased amount of £50,000 and would be able to pay him because he had a trust fund from his father in excess of that amount.' McGarry who ran his own design and architect practise denies two charges of soliciting murder and three charges of encouraging or assisting the commission of criminal offences. The trial continues.

"Ireland must wait a little longer to discover the great successor to Brian O’Driscoll as the two main contenders will pair up in the centres to face South Africa. The now-retired O’Driscoll has anointed Connacht centre Robbie Henshaw to assume his outside centre mantle - but the 21-year-old will start Saturday’s opening autumn Test at 12. The Athlone-born battering ram has replaced Gordon D’Arcy, still green after picking up a heavy knock in Castres at the end of last month. Connacht's Robbie Henshaw was expected to start at 13 as the long-term replacement for Brian O'Driscoll . Jonny Sexton, Henshaw and Jared Payne (right) will provide the creative spark in Ireland's backline . R Kearney (Leinster), T Bowe (Ulster), J Payne (Ulster), R Henshaw (Connacht), S Zebo (Munster), J Sexton (Racing Metro), C Murray (Munster), J McGrath, S Cronin, M Ross, D Toner (all Leinster), P O’Connell (Munster, capt), P O’Mahony (Munster), C Henry (Ulster), J Heaslip (Leinster). Replacements: R Strauss (Leinster), D Kilcoyne (Munster), R Ah You (Connacht), M McCarthy, R Ruddock, E Reddan, I Madigan (all Leinster), F Jones (Munster). That has paved the way for Ulster’s Jared Payne to slot in for his Test debut at outside centre, with Rob Kearney fit to start at full-back. Ireland boss Joe Schmidt is well known for keeping his cards close to his chest, and by pairing his two rivals for the famous 13 shirt in midfield he has not strayed from type one jot. From a centre pairing boasting 212 Ireland caps that closed last term’s Six Nations, Schmidt’s midfield duo will line up against the Springboks with a combined Test total of three appearances. Henshaw’s fourth international appearance is certainly a leap into the deep end, squaring up to the 102-cap South Africa captain Jean de Villiers. Tommy Bowe claims his wing berth after successfully negotiating return to play protocols after concussion. Brian O'Driscoll wipes the tears from his eyes after his final home International in last year's six nations . O'Driscoll has been Ireland's talisman at outside centre for more than a decade, and will take some replacing . Tighthead prop Mike Ross has won his fortnight-long fitness battle to ease Ireland’s front-row injury glut, with Leinster team-mate Sean Cronin slotting in for the sidelined Rory Best. Boss Schmidt must do without props Cian Healy, Marty Moore and Nathan White, so Rodney Ah You covers tighthead from the bench. Richardt Strauss takes a seat on the bench and is in line for his first cap since June 2013, and his second against the country of his birth. The 28-year-old has battled back from heart surgery and then tearing his hamstring off the bone to return to the Test arena. Barring long-term absentee Sean O’Brien Ireland have the luxury of selecting from strength in the back-five of the pack, with Paul O’Connell again captain and Chris Henry continuing at openside.

"A council flat bought under the 'right to buy' scheme for £48,000 is set to go on the market for £1million. The ground-floor property, in Chelsea, west London, has three bedrooms, a front terrace and a communal courtyard. It was bought in 1989 and is part of a post-war estate  made up of 30 council and privately-owned properties, near King's Road. First £1million council flat: The property, in Chelsea, west London was bought for £48,000 in 1989 . Now on the market for £999,950 - it's owner stands to make a staggering profit of £952,000. Property website Zoopla calls it a 'well-presented ground floor flat' offering 'a generous living space with well proportioned rooms in a sought-after area'. Owner June Woodward, 61, told The Sun on Sunday: 'The increase is incredible. Right to buy was a great way of getting on the property ladder and it is leaving the family with £1million.' Mrs Woodward, an admin worker, plans to split the money with her three siblings and has set her sights on a house in Watford. Zoopla calls it a 'well-presented ground floor flat' offering 'a generous living space with well proportioned rooms in a sought-after area' Owner June Woodward, 61, told The Sun on Sunday: 'The increase is incredible. Right to buy was a great way of getting on the property ladder and it is leaving the family with £1million' The flat is on the market for £999,950 - meaning Mts Woodward stands to make a staggering profit of £952,000. Just over a mile from the council flat is One Hyde Park, Knightsbridge, where the world's most expensive flat sold for £140million in May. West London is also home to the city's most expensive street, Kensington Palace Gardens - where Tamara Ecclestone lives in her £70million 57-room mansion. In July, Lawrence Poxton, 48, and his wife Teresa, 46, moved into a terraced property in Stoke-on-Trent, Staffordshire, after the council put 33 properties on the market for £1 in a desperate attempt to clean up the area. They were picked from thousands of applicants and were the first couple to take advantage of the scheme. According to property website Rightmove, last year most property sales in Kensington And Chelsea involved flats which sold for on average £1,360,211. Terraced properties sold for an average price of £4,094,657, while semi-detached properties fetched £8,502,589. During the last year, sold prices in Kensington And Chelsea were 21% up on the previous year and 49% up on 2011. The most expensive area of London to stay in a hotel is Soho - where the average hotel will set you back £219 per night. Knightsbridge came in at second at £216 per night, in the list compiled Cheaprooms.co.uk. It was bought in 1989 and is part of a post-war estate made up of 30 council and privately-owned properties . In October 2013 Southwark Council, in south-east London, auctioned off Britain’s most expensive council house - a four-story Grade II listed building - for £2.96million, to help pay for new homes. Built in 1820, the property was first used by bosses at Anchor Brewery before being taken over by Courage, an advert for which is still printed on its wall. The 200-year-old building, which is near Borough Market in London was bought by an anonymous bidder from Southwark Council, which said it would invest in at least 20 new social houses. Opposition: When the property went on auction, squatters who had been living in the house hung signs on the side of the building in protest .","Property in Chelsea, west London, near trendy King's Road, bought in 1989 .

"David Cameron is a 'mediocrity' who thinks the film Love Actually is a guide for running the country, new Ukip MP Douglas Carswell has claimed. The rebel backbencher said the Prime Minister and other leading politicians were only in the Commons for the power and did not care about changing things for ordinary people. He said: 'I think they've just watched Richard Curtis's Love Actually, and think it's a manual for how to govern the country.' David Cameron uses Love Actually as a 'manual' for running the country, according to Ukip MP Douglas Carswell . Douglas Carswell was sworn in as Ukip's first ever elected MP last week and immediately attacked the Government for failing to give voters the power to sack elected politicians through the power of 'recall' Mr Carswell, who stunned Westminster by defecting to Ukip over the summer, hit out at the MPs running the main Westminster parties. The Clacton MP, speaking to the Guardian, said: 'Why do we have to be governed by these mediocrities? 'Why do we have to be governed by people who read what they read in the Economist and the FT and regurgitate all the failed cliches that got us in to this mess?' In the 2003 hit film Hugh Grant plays a Prime Minister who stands up to the US President in a public showdown. Mr Carswell added: 'They want to hold office, but they don't know what to do with it. They watch The West Wing. They think it's all about giving speeches, positioning, going to Washington. They're not in it for change, they're in it to hold office. 'You can re-personalise politics. The moment I got a blog and a Twitter account I started thinking I can communicate directly with people. I don't need to be a pale imitation of Harry Enfield's Tory Boy.' Mr Carswell said ambitious MPs 'watch The West Wing [and] think it's all about giving speeches, positioning, going to Washington' Mr Carswell was scathing about political leaders obsessed about 'going to Washington'. In July Labour leader Ed Miliband and Shadow Foreign Secretary Douglas Alexander flew to the US to meet Barack Obama . David Cameron was likened to Hugh Grant's Prime Minister in Love Actually last year after launching a spirited defence of Britain in the face of Russian attacks. In the 2003 film Love Actually, Grant plays a PM who loses his temper with a bullying US President. He declares: 'We may be a small country, but we are a great one too. A country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot, come to that.' Last year, after Britain was dismissed as a 'small island that no-one pays attention to' Mr Cameron angrily hit back. He said: 'We're a country that invented many of the things that are most worthwhile, everything from the industrial revolution and television to the world wide web. 'Our music delights and amuses millions. The Beatles, Elgar and slightly less er... congruously, One Direction have conquered the world.' The Ukip MP's remarks will sting Mr Cameron, who once declared that he wanted to be Prime Minister because he 'would be good' at the job. Mr Cameron was widely mocked last year after aping the Love Actually Prime Minister's defence of Britain. After Britain was dismissed as a 'small island that no-one pays attention to' Mr Cameron angrily hit back. He said: 'We're a country that invented many of the things that are most worthwhile, everything from the industrial revolution and television to the world wide web. 'Our music delights and amuses millions. The Beatles, Elgar and slightly less er... congruously, One Direction have conquered the world.' He went on: 'We have invented most of the sports that the world most likes playing. 'If I go on too long about our literature, our art, our philosophy, our contribution, including of course the world's language...' He then quoted from Shakespeare's Richard II, saying: 'If I start talking about this blessed plot, this sceptered isle, this England I may have to put it to music so I might have to leave it there.' The outburst was immediately compared to the scene in Love Actually in which Hugh Grant's Prime Minister declares: 'We may be a small country, but we are a great one too. 'A country of Shakespeare, Churchill, the Beatles, Sean Connery, Harry Potter. David Beckham's right foot. David Beckham's left foot, come to that. 'A friend who bullies us is no longer a friend. And since bullies only respond to strength, from now on I am prepared to be much stronger.' The only difference between the words of screenwriter Richard Curtis and Mr Cameron is who they were aimed at. While Mr Cameron is furious with Russia, Grant was hitting back at the President of the United States, played by Billy Bob Thornton, over amid doubts about the state of the UK-US 'special relationship'. Mr Carswell was returned to Parliament with a comfortable 12,404 majority in the October 9 by-election after deciding to stand down as an MP rather than sit in the Commons until next year's election. He said he decided to quit the Conservatives earlier this year, but found it very hard. He said: 'I was very stressed in the six months before I announced it. July and August were horrible. I knew I had to do this, and I was terrified. I had difficulty sleeping.' Mr Carswell said the country was being badly run - despite all the people running it going to Oxford and Cambridge. He said: 'All the people who went to the same colleges, and read PPE, which means they all think they know everything about everything … and we wonder why the country is so badly run.'","Backbencher says Westminster leaders are only in it for the power .

"New doubts arose over the handling of the first Ebola patient diagnosed in the US after his family claims the hospital that cared for him has withheld records of experimental drug testing for weeks. Thomas Eric Duncan's sister Mai Wureh has claimed that out of thousands of pages of medical files released by Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas, information about the drug brincidofovir were not given. Wureh, herself a registered nurse, had been concerned about Duncan receiving the drug since he was first administered a dose. Stacks: Thomas Duncan's nephew, Josephus Weeks, combs through 1,450 pages of records released after Duncan's death, but no records of an experimental drug used have so far been found . She says she attempted to phone the medical records division repeatedly after his death in order to obtain more information about its effects and the treatment regimen. In the collection of records, which totals 1,450 pages, was a code supposed to allow access to electronic records for the family, but Wureh alleges it does not work. 'I called for a new code and was told that they could no longer release information to me,' she said, saying a liaison said the hospital could only release information to Duncan's son Karsiah, 19. Among 1,450 pages of records, Wureh was listed as the 'primary decision maker' because Duncan was incapable of making decisions for clinical care. She and her son Josephus Weeks were also listed as hospital contacts and 'consents relatives' by Dr Gary Weinstein, the chief of pulmonology and critical care, two days before Duncan's death. The first page of the collection of records is addressed to Wureh and states 'additional information may be added to the record.' Decision maker: Mai Wureh was determined to be 'primary decision maker' for Thomas Duncan's clinical care because of her background as a registered nurse . Patient zero: Thomas Eric Duncan was diagnosed with Ebola at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital Dallas and died there in October after treatments failed to rid him of the virus . After being contacted by the Associated Press Tuesday night, spokesperson Wendell Watson said the hospital 'will be reaching out and providing the requested information.' Houston attorney Joseph Larsen, who has worked with medical records in past cases, says it's not within the power of the hospital to change who can request and receive records. 'That's absolutely not within the power of the hospital to change that,' he says. Weeks says Wureh made requests including for records of lab work while visiting Duncan shortly before his death that have gone unfulfilled, along with requests for information on his cremation. Karsiah Duncan signed documents related to his father's cremation, says George Mason, the pastor of Louise Troh, Duncan's fiancee.

"Jennifer and Chris Nugent had spent thousands of dollars to turn a spacious house in Mooresville Indiana, into their dream home where they were hoping to raise their children and retire one day. But what the Nugents did not know was that their new house was a former meth den that was now slowly poisoning their entire family, including their pet dog. Chris and Jenny Nugent used all their savings last year to take out a mortgage on a $144,000 two-story house with a porch and an acre of land. Scroll down for video . What lurks inside: The Nugent family bought this home in Moorseville, Indiana, last year, only to discover that it has been contaminated with meth . Worst fears confirmed: Jenny and Chris Nugent (left) were told by a neighbor that the previous owner of the house, Josh Argue (right), allegedly used to cook and smoke meth inside their new home . Before closing on the house, they paid for a home inspection which came back clean: no termites or mold were found. So in May 2013 the Nugents proceeded with an extensive makeover. But as soon as they moved in, everyone in the house started getting sick, including the couple's two young daughters and infant son. 'They were sick every week,' Jenny Nugent told ABC News. 'They would wake up. Throw up. Have digestive issues and then by noon, one o’clock start to feel better.' The mystery malady seemed to be affecting the entire household, and even the family dog eventually had to be euthanized after falling ill with cancer. For the Nugents, one early tell-tale sign was a strange metallic smell that permeated the house and was especially strong in the kitchen. Sickened: The Nugents' three children (pictured), and even the family dog, suffered from vomiting, nausea, difficulty breathing and headaches. The pet eventually fell ill with cancer and had to be put down . From dream home to house of horrors: A test showed that the first floor, including the baby room, had meth levels 18 times higher than what is considered safe . Driven out: After learning the awful truth, the family moved out of the remodeled house and into an apartment . Then in February a neighbor finally shed light on what was happening inside their home: the previous owner had allegedly cooked and used methamphetamine inside. Mrs Nugent immediately purchased a meth test kit for $50, and the results confirmed their worst fears. The first floor of their house, including the baby room, had meth levels 18 times higher than what is considered safe under the law, and the upstairs bedrooms were three times the legal limit.. The Nugents moved out of their dream home at once and settled in an apartment after discarding most of their belonging for fear of contamination, . ‘It feels like a death happened, to be honest,’ Jenny Nugent said. ‘That’s how it feels to my husband and I.’ The process of manufacturing meth involves highly toxic chemicals, which give off noxious fumes that contaminate everything in sight, including carpets and paint on the walls. Prolonged exposure to methamphetamine particles can cause vomiting, difficulty breathing and headaches. Chris Nugent, a retired US Marine, said that he, his wife and their three children were constantly out of breath and thought they were having asthma attacks on a nearly daily basis. ‘I feel like I put them in harm's way more so than I ever could have just staying where we were. I regret moving so bad,' the mother of three told WRTV. Legal action: The Nugents have filed a lawsuit against their real estate agent, Lori Argue (pictured center), claiming that she had to know the truth about the house since it was her own son, Josh (pictured far left), who used to own it . In order to resell the one-time drug den, the Nugents have been forced to hire a professional cleaning company to decontaminate the entire house to the tune of $10,000, which they had to pay out of pocket because their insurance company refused to cover the clean-up cost citing 'pollution exclusions' in their policy. The family have now filed a lawsuit against the real estate agent who sold them the property, along with the real estate company, Carpenter Realtors, and the former owner, claiming breach of contract. According to the Nugents, realtor Lori Argue had to know the seedy history of the house since the person who had lived there before them was her son, Joshua Argue. A lawyer for the realtor has vehemently denied any knowledge of meth use or contamination of the property in a statement to ABC News. The Nugents are not alone. Since 2007, more than 3,400 dwellings have been identified as meth labs in Indiana - the highest number in the nation.","Jenny and Chris Nugent bought a home in Mooresville, Indiana, last year after it past inspection .

"Last month, U.K. woman Danielle Andrews welcomed the first girl into her family in a century. Since before World War I, Ms Andrews' family had produced only male offspring. But she may have been one-upped. Darwin grandmother Alex Martin says her family had a 'boy drought' for 138 years. Drought's over: Alex Martin, left, with her son, Luke. Family: Alex Martin, pictured with her grandparents, mother and aunt. Every member of her bloodline was a female. A Martin family tree. The 'boy drought' ended in 1986, when Alex's son Luke was born. Before Ms Martin broke the chain in the 1980s, the last boy in her bloodline was her great, great grandfather, Henry Ellis. He was born in 1848, running a shop in Cambrian Head, in NSW's Central West. Queen Victoria ruled the British Empire, Melbourne had only recently been declared a city and Australia was more than a half-century away from Federation. After her great, great grandfather, there was a big gap. Henry and his wife, Annie, had three girls. One of them, Annie Thomson, was named after her mother. She would be Alex's great-grandmother. The tradition would continue on from there. Her grandmother, Marjorie, and her mother, Barbara Crick, were only children. And Ms Crick gave birth to Alex. 'Who said women were the weaker sex?' Ms Martin quipped. Ms Martin's grandparents on their 60th wedding anniversary. Ms Martin's children: Rachael and Luke. The drought's over! Luke Martin's young son, Mason is pictured. Hello, bubba! Luke Martin's young son, Mason is pictured. To no one's surprise, Ms Martin's first daughter was also a girl, baby Rachael. But Ms Martin finally brought the family's Great Boy Drought to an end in 1986 when she welcomed her first and only son into the world. 'When I had Luke I thought, oh, OK!' she said. 'This is a first.' Her grandfather was especially 'rapt', she said. She realised her very female heritage while reading a story about the very male bloodline of Ms Andrews in the The Northern Territory News earlier this week. Years after her son was born, 'the drought's well and truly broken,' Ms Martin told Daily Mail Australia. Ms Martin is the grandmother of three boys - Byron, 9, Bailey, 7, and Mason, 5 - and, of course, of two girls, Codie, 11, and Bella, 7. And she said she's 'very proud' of all of them.

And he believes there has been a lack of action from world leaders on tackling the threats. 'The biggest threat to civilisation is human stupidity,' he said. 'The problem with these points is that if you make them carelessly you end up sounding like Morrissey in his teenage years,' he told Radio Times magazine. 'They're so obvious that they become cliched positions to take, but actually they're not cliched positions. 'The more we consider our position in the wider universe, the more pressing these questions become.' He added: 'When you think about these things, you end up with your head in your hands. Imagine an alien from another galaxy came and had a look at us. 'If there's just this one planet on which there's any meaning, how would you arrange your affairs? Would you really sit there and divide it up into lots of autonomous regions and spend a lot of money making sure they don't invade each other? 'Or would you be more concerned with protecting civilisation as a whole, such as making sure we're not going to get wiped out by a big space rock.' He warned: 'It won't turn out well for us if we sit here on Earth and don't bother with space. As a world, I would like to see us go to Mars - for the same reason we went to the moon.' One of Professor Cox' main concerns is climate change. This graphic from the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change shows projected climate change from 2081-2100 . When do you think we will find life on other planets? We should be on the verge. If there is life on Mars we should find it in the next decade or so. We’re also at the stage now, with the new generation of telescopes, where we can look at the light coming through the atmospheres of planets out there and start to characterise it. We might detect life on other planets before we detect it in the solar system which is exciting. Do you think we can create robots that are conscious? I suspect we will do it at some point. I think we will make a machine that is conscious, unless there is some physics that we don’t understand about consciousness. If you think the brain is basically a computing device, but a very complicated one, then presumably it operates according to the known laws of physics and therefore you should be able to simulate them. Do you think we should be working on artificial intelligence if it's a threat to humanity? I mean, you are talking about the far future. And things you say about the far future often sound fantastical. But [the threat of artificial intelligence] is a legitimate question. It’s an ethical dilemma. I don’t know. Conscious things are notoriously difficult to deal with – look at humans..many people would argue ignorance is more dangerous than knowledge, but of course you have to learn to be responsible with knowledge. What research are you most excited about at the moment? I’m very excited about the discovery of the Higgs particle. There are huge problems with the way that fits into our picture of the universe. So the fact the Large Hadron Collider is coming back online again next year, and that we’re going to start exploring the Higgs particle for the first time, is interesting. Professor Cox points out that the Apollo astronauts thought we'd be on Mars by now, and that we'd have moon bases by the 1980s. In an interview with MailOnline earlier this month, Professor Cox said the problem is in human behaviour. 'We just don’t accumulate knowledge at the rate that we could. 'We just don’t. I mean, you can see it by the figures. We spend virtually about as much on it as everyone else, which is sod all.' Professor Cox has filmed a new five-part series, Human Universe, for BBC2. He spent three hours in a spacesuit for the show and admitted: 'You'd think it would be brilliant being an astronaut but I knackered my ribs and they took five months to recover.' He said of his career on the small-screen: 'Television's really important but I don't see myself as a TV presenter. 'I want to carry on encouraging governments to do the correct thing, which is to invest in education and research.'

"A talented teenage jockey paralysed in a car crash just after completing her first competitive races is back in the saddle after being given pioneering treatment using a bionic leg. Katie Watson, 19, from Ilkeston, Derbyshire, broke her neck when her car aquaplaned on a puddle in Cirencester, Gloucestershire, in February and flipped over. She spent five months in hospital and had daily physiotherapy, where she became one of the first people in the UK to use a bionic leg. Promising jockey Katie Watson, 19, was told she would never walk again after breaking her neck in a car crash - but is now back in the saddle after becoming one of the first people in the UK to use a bionic leg (left) Miss Watson had just completed her first two competitive races when she broke her neck in an accident and was left bedridden . The battery-powered device sits over the patient's own limb and responds to their desire to move, helping them learn to walk again. Miss Watson is already able to walk unaided, started riding again a month ago and says she hopes to return to competitive racing soon. She said: 'I was told by two different doctors and a consultant that I would never walk again, which was devastating to hear but I was determined to do whatever it took to get back on my feet, . 'The Bionic Leg is amazing and has helped me so much. I would wear it every day for half an hour and its effects would carry over. 'At first I used a walking frame, two sticks, then one stick and now I can walk unaided. Four weeks ago I got back on a horse and I want to get back to race-riding again.' Miss Watson is currently living at Oaksey House in Lambourn, Berkshire, a rehabilitation centre funded by the Injured Jockeys Fund. Miss Watson flipped her car over after aquaplaning on a puddle near  Cirencester in Gloucestershire . She was rushed to hospital (left) where she had to learn to walk again using a frame and walking sticks. The bionic leg fitted over her limb and responded to her desire to walk, assisting the recovery . The accident happened when she was driving back from visiting her boyfriend in Cheltenham to work in Lambourn. She had been at the beginning of her promising career as a professional flat jockey, having competed in two rides. AlterG, the company which make the electronic limb, claim it is the world's first bionic leg and say the device is designed to help patients after stroke, injury, orthopaedic surgery or traumatic brain injury. John Hammond, a clinical specialist for AlterG, said the bionic leg had recently launched in the UK. Miss Watson began riding again a month ago and says she would like to get back to competitive racing as soon as she feels able . He said: 'The Bionic Leg is a crucial piece of equipment for stroke rehabilitation and therapy for patients with chronic, degenerative neurological gait impairment including Parkinson's disease and multiple sclerosis. 'It's excellent that we can now offer the benefits that the Bionic Leg delivers to people in the UK.' The device is claimed to help improve patient stance and strength, stability and gait while sensing their movements and only assisting when necessary.","Katie Watson, 19, suffered broken neck after car aquaplaned and flipped .

"It was the controversial singlet pulled from the shelves of two Woolworths stores after accusations it was emblazoned with a 'racist' message. But Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie has said the singlet's 'if you don't love it, leave' message did not go far enough. 'In my view, the message on the singlet didn't go far enough,' Ms Lambie told Daily Mail Australia on Wednesday. 'It should have read, ""If you don't love it - leave - before we deport you.""' Scroll down for video . The singlet featured an image of the Australian flag and the text: 'If you don't love it, leave' Outraged: Palmer United Party Senator Jacqui Lambie said 'What sort of weak-minded fool would think that a singlet, which shows a sign that reads, “If you don’t love it – leave” on an Australian flag background is racist?' Fiery debate: 2GB talkback hosts Ray Hadley and Ben Fordham were critical of Woolworths' decision to pull the singlet . The outspoken senator is the latest conservative-leaning identity to criticise the supermarket's decision to withdraw the singlet from two of its stores this week - first revealed by Daily Mail Australia - after they were delivered 'in error'. Sydney talkback radio host Ray Hadley blasted the supermarket's move on Tuesday morning, telling his listeners: 'It (the singlet) is not racist, it's simply a fact of life.' His colleague, 2GB afternoon host Ben Fordham, offered to give away 50 T-shirts bearing the slogan. Senator Lambie, who drew fire earlier this week for praising Russian President Vladimir Putin, referenced Islamic extremists in justifying her position. 'And if the Greens or any other weak-minded idiots think that’s politically incorrect or racist – at least my message isn’t as “racist” as the message which is being spread world-wide by the Islamic extremists and their mates in Australia - on blood soaked black flags which essentially reads: “If you don’t love it – you’re dead – because we’ll cut off your head"",' she said in a statement. Ms Lambie also described people who believed the singlet was racist as 'weak minded fool(s)'. The controversy over the apparel began on Monday after a shopper noticed the singlet on sale at Woolworths' Cairns supermarket. '@woolworths, Cairns, selling racist singlets for everyday low prices!' the user tweeted. The post was shared by staff of Greens MP Adam Bandt on his Facebook page, who described the singlet as 'divisive and ridiculous'. Woolworths removed the items from stock immediately after the supermarket was made aware, a spokesman said. 'The singlet was not one we ordered,' he told Daily Mail Australia. 'It was delivered to us in error and should never been allowed on our shelves.' Controversial: Senator Jacqui Lambie has waded into the debate surrounding the controversial singlet . Led the backlash: Adam Bandt and his staff criticised the 'if you don't like it, leave' singlet - and Woolworths withdrew the item from stock at two of its stores . The tweet that started it all: This social media post sparked a fierce backlash against Woolworths. Many customers pledged to boycott the company . The company's Facebook page was bombarded with comments critical of the supermarket stocking the singlet, with some shoppers even declaring they would boycott the store. One comment said: 'There's no way on earth I'm spending my weekly shopping budget at a supermarket who thinks it's fine to sell racism themed apparel.' Another said: 'Get rid of the racist shirts and sack whoever thought it was a good idea.' Mr Bandt praised Woolworths' move in an interview with the Today Show. 'I think if you put yourself in the shoes of someone who is walking down the street and they see this T-shirt, it's not exactly sending a message of inclusion and welcome, is it?' he said. Senator Lambie said a justification for her argument could be found in the nation's most important legal document. 'The constitution of Australia reflects the simple and powerful message contained in that singlet'. 'Section 44 strictly prohibits anyone with divided loyalties to another country or any allegiances to a foreign power, from standing for Parliament.' 'And that’s the underlying issue and important political question that our nation must have a mature discussion about i.e. Divided loyalties and foreign allegiances – Should Australia accept them?' Neil Booth, the Sydney businessman whose company sold the singlets to Woolworths, told Daily Mail Australia only 'six to eight' of the singlets would have been distributed to the stores. 'What sort of weak-minded fool would think that a singlet, which shows a sign that reads, “If you don’t love it – leave” on an Australian flag background is racist? The constitution of Australia reflects the simple and powerful message contained in that singlet. Section 44 strictly prohibits anyone with divided loyalties to another country or any allegiances to a foreign power, from standing for parliament. And that’s the underlying issue and important political question that our nation must have a mature discussion about i.e. Divided loyalties and foreign allegiances – Should Australia accept them? When anyone makes the decision to live in Australia – they must swear undying, undivided love, loyalty and allegiance to our democratic system of government, constitution and laws. There are no exceptions. If Australia were allowed to follow the example of every other country in history where divided loyalties and foreign allegiances were allowed to exist, our Nation would split apart and be at war with itself. And perhaps that’s what we’re experiencing now. If not overt, but certainly a covert war between people in Australia who love the free democratic country they live in without any reservations, divided loyalties or foreign allegiances -and those who want to impose their culture, beliefs and laws on the rest of us. The only place for divided loyalties in Australia is in sport – maybe. But when it comes to the deadly serious issue of law, democratic system of government, flag and constitution – divided loyalties and allegiances to foreign powers should be strictly prohibited. Anyone who displays or admits to a divided loyalty or an allegiance to a foreign power should be denied the right to vote and any right to taxpayer assistance. In my view, the message on the singlet didn’t go far enough. It should have read, “If you don’t love it – leave – before we deport you.” And if the Greens or any other weak-minded idiots think that’s politically incorrect or racist – at least my message isn’t as “racist” as the message which is being spread world-wide by the Islamic extremists and their mates in Australia - on blood soaked black flags which essentially reads: . “If you don’t love it – you’re dead – because we’ll cut off your head.”'","The singlet was pulled from the shelves of Woolworths after criticism on social media .

"One of 200 schoolgirls abducted by Islamist Boko Haram rebels in the northeastern Nigerian village of Chibok was freed this week, police and a parent of some of the other missing girls said on Thursday. Boko Haram militants took the girls from a secondary school in the village near the Cameroon border in April. The case of the abducted school girls drew global attention, magnified by a #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign that drew in celebrities including Michelle Obama and Angelina Jolie. Scroll down for video . Boko Haram militants took the girls from a secondary school in the village near the Cameroon border in April and released this video of them shortly afterwards . This is a still from a video released by Boko Haram showing a man claiming to be Abubakar Shekau, the leader of the group. Nigeria's military on Wednesday claimed for the first time that he was dead, as it said troops had killed a lookalike who had been posing as the militant commander . Nigerian President Goodluck Jonathan told the United Nations General Assembly on Wednesday that authorities were still working to free the girls. Jonathan has been criticized at home and abroad for his slow response to the kidnapping in the rural northeast and for his inability to quell the violence by the Islamist militant group, whose name means 'Western education is forbidden.' 'Although it has been over three months since they were abducted, we have never relented in our efforts to set them safely free,' Jonathan told the 193-member world body. 'Together with our partners, we are working assiduously to free our daughters and reunite them with their families,' he said. 'We shall not waiver until we end this mindless war on the innocent and bring all the perpetrators to justice.' A year-old intensive military operation against Boko Haram has so far failed to crush the rebels, whose struggle for an Islamic state in largely Muslim northern Nigeria has killed thousands since it was launched in 2009. However, Nigeria's military on Wednesday claimed for the first time that Abubakar Shekau, the leader of Boko Haram, was dead, as it said troops had killed a lookalike who had been posing as the militant commander.

"A mother-of-two suffered severe burns and painful blisters on her face and chest after applying fake blood as the finishing touches to a Halloween costume. Victoria Eaton, from north Yorkshire, noticed a white foam fizzing from her skin within 30 minutes as a burning sensation seared across her chest and face and her skin began to peel. Today the 46-year-old is urging parents to be vigilant when buying any face paints or novelty cosmetic products for their children this Halloween. Following an investigation into the product Mrs Eaton bought online, it emerged the fake blood was untested and defective. Victoria Eaton, pictured with her son Russell, 10, has been awarded nearly £2,000 compensation after fake blood she applied as part of her Halloween costume caused burns to her skin . She was awarded £1,987 in compensation. Mrs Eaton said: 'The fake blood quickly caused a burning sensation, it was incredibly painful and became very itchy. 'Despite receiving treatment at A&E, I was left with blistering and redness which lasted for weeks. 'It was a really difficult time and the incident had a real impact on my everyday life. 'I had to cover my face and chest with a scarf at work during this period - it was very embarrassing and I became very self-conscious. 'What's worse is that I had offered to put some of the fake blood on my son for his costume. 'He happened to say that he didn't want any, but I dread to think what would have happened had he said ""yes"".' Mrs Eaton is urging all parents to check the fine print on these sorts of products and to buy them from reputable suppliers, rather than online, . Within 30 minutes of applying the fake blood, which she bought online, she noticed a white foam and a burning sensation searing across her chest and chin . She was left with painful blistering and scars that left her feeling self-conscious for months. She is today urging parents to be vigilant when buying face paints and other novelty cosmetics for Halloween . She added: 'I don't want anyone else to go through what I went through.' Catherine Reynolds at Thompsons Solicitors who represented the mother-of-two, said: 'Victoria's case is a Halloween horror story come true and underlines the dangers that are present for parents buying products online. 'We need tighter rules to stop the sale of untested products that come into the UK via import.

"The monies brought through the doors at Stamford Bridge and Anfield over the summer were notably similar; so too the cash spent on new signings. What's killed off any hope of Liverpool challenging for the title is the difference in quality of those incoming. It doesn't make pretty reading for Liverpool supporters, who felt they were on their way to a first Premier League crown when this pair last met in April. It had looked for all the world they'd seal it, but that came tumbling down with Demba Ba's strike and Jose Mourinho's merry dance. Since then the Reds have gone backwards - and markedly so. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Liverpool recouped over £60million in a deal that saw Luis Suarez sign for Barcelona in the summer . Brendan Rodgers was always going to find replacing star striker Suarez difficult . Dejan Lovren (£10m) Mario Balotelli (£16m) Adam Lallana (£25m) Lazar Markovic (£20m) Alberto Moreno (£12m) Emre Can (£10m) Divock Origi (£10m) Rickie Lambert (£4m) Afforded a wealth of money to revamp their entire squad after the sale of Luis Suarez to Barcelona, Brendan Rodgers has so far failed miserably. The spine of Southampton's impressive side to have finished eighth last season was picked apart by the Northern Irishman. Rickie Lambert, Adam Lallana and Dejan Lovren all penned deals. Fine, you'd think, if this was a team to have ended the previous campaign seventh and needed to kick on. Unfortunately for Liverpool, these signings came a year too late. Certainly not those of a side who had designs of the title. These mistakes cost them a pretty penny, too. Lallana is yet to impact a game from midfield, Lambert is used as a substitute only and Lovren just doesn't have the positional awareness of a top central defender. Brendan Rodgers doesn't seem to have made the most of his summer spending money . Brendan Rodgers raided Southampton's squad, signing Rickie Lambert (left) and Adam Lallana . The Anfield club signed former Saints defender Dejan Lovren (right) for £10million . Whether Rodgers is now questioning the wisdom of splashing around £50million on a trio of players with absolutely no experience of challenging for titles and just one with previous in the Champions League is unknown. But you'd have to imagine he's at least pondered whether  the biggest opportunity of his managerial career has been squandered in a flurry of giddy excitement with chequebook in hand. Cesc Fabregas (£30m) Diego Costa (£32m) Filipe Luis (£16m) Didier Drogba (free) Loic Remy (£10m) The most galling aspect of their struggles since August is that the war chest was mismanaged to such an extent that Chelsea have shown them up horribly. They too recouped around £75m thanks to the sales of David Luiz to Paris St Germain and Romelu Lukaku to Everton, but spent it wisely. See Diego Costa and Cesc Fabregas - arguably the best players in the division. Perhaps Rodgers' perception of his club isn't aligned with what they achieved last year. Why, with the millions at their disposal, did he not try and land players to have a real impact on the Premier League and Europe? Mario Balotelli has struggled to make an impact since his £16million move from AC Milan . Chelsea managed to collect £50m from PSG for the signature of Brazilian defender David Luiz . At one stage, Loic Remy looked set to sign for Liverpool, but ended up sealing a deal to Stamford Bridge . Whether Costa would have fancied the north-west over London is debatable, but Liverpool needed to do more than roll a £16m dice on Mario Balotelli. By contrast, the Blues secured their top targets and added Filipe Luis from Atletico Madrid as well. Loic Remy - whose move to Liverpool collapsed after a medical - was allowed to join the league leaders. Used largely as a substitute, the Frenchman could have offered so much more from the start for Rodgers. The individual prices paid for Costa and Fabregas are higher than splashed by Liverpool, proving it's more efficient to spend extra money on one player and sign fewer than to accumulate numbers who aren't going to have an impact. Diego Costa, signed for £32million, has scored nine Premier League goals so far this season . Cesc Fabregas has been arguably the best signing of the summer, grabbing nine assists for his new team .

"The Mormon church is addressing the mystery that has long surrounded undergarments worn by its faithful with a new video explaining the practice in-depth while admonishing ridicule from outsiders about what it considers a symbol of Latter-day Saints' devotion to God. The four-minute video on The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints' website compares the white, two-piece cotton 'temple garments' to holy vestments worn in other religious faiths such as a Catholic nun's habit or a Muslim skullcap. The footage is part of a recent effort by the Salt Lake City-based religion to explain, expand or clarify on some of the faith's more sensitive beliefs. Articles posted on the church's website in the past two years have addressed the faith's past ban on black men in the lay clergy; its early history of polygamy; and the misconception that members are taught they'll get their own planet in the afterlife. Sacred garb:The Mormon church is peeling back the mystery that has long surrounded undergarments worn by devout Latter-day Saints with a new video that explains the practice in depth . Items of prayer: The undergarments are worn daily by devout adult Latter-day Saints as a reminder of their commitment to God to live good, honorable lives . The latest video dispels the notion that Latter-day Saints believe temple garments have special protective powers, a stereotype perpetuated on the Internet and in popular culture by those who refer to the sacred clothing as 'magical Mormon underwear.' 'These words are not only inaccurate but also offensive to members,' the video says. 'There is nothing magical or mystical about temple garments, and church members ask for the same degree of respect and sensitivity that would be afforded to any other faith by people of goodwill."" The video and accompanying article feature more detailed information about the garments than has ever before been released to the public, Mormon scholars say. It was made to fill a void on the Internet, which has little, if any, accurate information about the undergarments, church spokesman Eric Hawkins said in a statement. The video, also available on YouTube, explains that the undergarments are worn daily by devout adult Latter-day Saints as a reminder of their commitment to God to live good, honorable lives. Display of devotion: A member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints holds a package containing  the 'temple garment' Comparisons: The video explains that the undergarments worn under clothing by Mormons is similar to the Jewish prayer shawl and the catholic nun's habit . The garments, which resemble a T-shirt and shorts, are shown laid out on a table in what marks a rare public glimpse at clothing that normally is hidden from outsiders. Members are taught not to hang the garments in public places to dry or display them in view of people 'who do not understand their significance.' The video comes two years after jabs about the undergarments were lobbed at Mitt Romney in 2012 with the intent to damage his candidacy as the first Mormon presidential nominee of a major political party. At one point during the campaign, New York Times columnist Charles Blow tweeted, 'I'm a single parent and my kids are amazing! Stick that in your magic underwear,' after Romney decried the country's rate of out-of-wedlock births. The video's focus on the offensiveness of flippant remarks about the undergarments shows the church no longer will tolerate them, Armand Mauss, a retired professor of sociology and religious studies at Washington State University. The church has some 15 million members worldwide. Latter-day Saints seem pleased by the refreshing transparency from the church on a topic that has been the source of much curiosity among outsiders, some whom are rude about it, said Jana Riess, who blogs about Mormonism for the Religion News Service. She wrote this week that she hopes the footage will 'persuade gawkers that there's nothing to see here, folks.' 'They now have something official to point to if people ask questions,' Riess said in an interview. 'I love that they put it on YouTube for the entire world to see. I think that's very brave.' Secret prayer garb: Unlike in other religions where prayer items are visible to the public eye, the Mormons wear their sacred garb beneath their everyday clothes . Dispelling misconception: 'These words are not only inaccurate but also offensive to members,'says the video of people calling the scared undergarments magical Mormon underwear .

"A man has offered to fund an education for the men who allegedly tied him up, locked his housekeeper in a bathroom, and robbed his Texas home. Police have launched a manhunt across Houston to find four men who they say posed as delivery men then threatened the homeowner at gunpoint before making off with cash, jewelry and guns from a safe. And as an incentive for the alleged thieves, the victim, a physician, says he will pay for them to go to college to help them get out of a life of crime. A priceless offer: This is a sketch of two of the four alleged burglars who are being offered the chance to go to college if they turn themselves in. They stand accused of raiding a Houston, Texas, home brandishing guns . There is no financial limit to the offer, they revealed. His wife Arielle Lawson told ABC13: 'We want to be able to say to them that they could make better choice, so they don't have any excuse in the future to look back and say they had to be felons or bad guys.' 'My husband is...very hurt. My children have been traumatized, and one of my children he cannot sleep at night,' she added. According to investigators, the housekeeper answered a knock on the front door on October 17 to find both men wearing ski masks and brandishing handguns. They were accompanied by a Hispanic man holding two cardboard boxes, they said. 'No limit': Arielle Lawson, whose husband was allegedly tied up by the thieves, said there is no financial limit . Targeted: The housekeeper (above) was locked in a bathroom by the gang posing as delivery men, police say . The pair are said to have locked the housekeeper in a cupboard then advancing on the homeowner. Tying his hands behind his back, they marched him to the safe and ordered him to explain how to open it, investigators claim. The suspects allegedly took cell phones from the homeowner and housekeeper then fled on foot, ABC7 reported. Raided: The group took off with cash, jewelry and firearms from the home in Houston, Texas, it is claimed . Lawson's 11-year-old daughter said: 'I'm just glad that if the people do think about turning themselves in, they might be able to have a better education and go on with a different life instead of just being a criminal.'

The frames of the glasses are fitted with two micro-projectors - one for each eye. Each projector beams a . perspective view of a stereoscopic 3D image onto the retro-reflective surface. A tiny camera, fitted between the projectors, scans for infrared . identification markers placed on this surface. This . camera has a built-in tracking system that detects slight movements of a . player's eyes and hands, and moves the images so they stay in line with . their head. This means a player's eyes . focus on the projected image at a 'very natural and comfortable viewing . distance.' A tracking grid sits . underneath the retro-reflective surface and when used with tags, or specially created game boards, can track . physical objects including miniature figures, cards, game pieces, or . anything else that fits on top of the surface. The camera uses these . markers to precisely track a player's head position and orientation in the . physical world. Software can then adjust how the . holographic scene should appear.

"Emmy and Tony award-winning actor and comic Martin Short met the woman of his dreams, actress Nancy Dolma, in July 1974. It was love at first sight, and they had 36 blissful years and three children together. And then, in 2010, Nancy tragically died from ovarian cancer. But today Nancy is not only still the woman of Short's dreams - she is his reality. The comic confesses he’s blissfully haunted by her ghost and converses with her every day at their home in the Pacific Palisades, California. in his new book, I Must Say: My Life as a Humble Comedy Legend, published by HARPER, an imprint of HarperCollins Publishers. Scroll down for video . Nancy's in the house:  Martin Short lost Nancy, his wife of 36 years, to ovarian cancer in 2010, but she is very much a presence in his life . Topper: Short compares his life to the 1930’s film comedy Topper, played by Roland Young who was cheerily haunted by the ghosts of two deceased friends, a fun-loving couple played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett . ‘I’m still very much married to Nancy’, says Short, 64,  who got his start on SCTV and Saturday Night Live, . He’s not ready to forget, move on, or be fixed up with women for companionship. Nancy’s in the house. Short compares his life to the 1930’s film comedy Topper, played by Roland Young who was cheerily haunted by the ghosts of two deceased friends, a fun-loving couple played by Cary Grant and Constance Bennett. ‘In my case, it’s Nancy with whom I happily converse, even while the rest of the world can’t see her’. ‘In our thirty-six years together we became so intimately familiar with the workings of each other’s minds that I can convincingly play out the conversations we would be having today, about things that postdate Nancy’s death, -- the continued adventures of our three kids, the arrival of HRH Prince George of Cambridge, the Chris Christie ‘Bridgegate’ scandal, and such curiosities as twerking, Ted Cruz…..’ Martin has the sense that ‘Nancy has only slipped away into the next room’. Ole! Short starred in  Three Amigos with Chevy Chase and Steve Martin . Funnyman: Martin as Saturday Night Live fan favorite Ed Grimley during ""Hospital"" skit in 1985. He originated the character for Toronto's Second City comedy troop . ‘So some night, when I’m really missing her, I’ll grab a rum and Coke at twilight and sit on the couch on our front porch, or perhaps upstairs, on the balcony off of our bedroom, with the Pacific Ocean in view’. ‘I’ll call out, ‘Hey, Nan’! Forming the words just feels good in the throat’. Or he does something they always did in the car when Nancy would say ‘Hand of a hand’, which was a cue for Martin to put his right hand in her left. ‘Kiss the hand’, he’d say and she would lift it to her lips and kiss it. ‘I still offer my hand to Nancy – it’s how I initiate our conversations’. ‘These, our talks, go on internally, not out loud. You won’t find me sitting out there chattering away, switching seats, schizophrenically playacting both parts. ‘But we do talk, Nancy and I, and I can totally hear where she agrees with me and where she disagrees’. Short, Canadian-born, met Nancy Dolman during the Toronto production of the musical Godspell when she stepped in as Gilda Radner’s understudy. Martin's  Ed Grimley takes on Tina Turner as Miss Malone in 1985 . At the time, Short was involved in an on-and-off relationship for two years with the mercurial and darkly neurotic Radner when he met Nancy. That relationship ended in July 1974. Having a drink at his favorite watering hole in Toronto, Nancy walked in and they fell into each other’s arms forever after. They were married six years later, in 1980. The actor lost both parents and his brother by the time he was 20 and from that tragedy, he was able to find some optimism within. He had what felt like a visitation after the family deaths that fulfilled a need for closure at the time. ‘Something terrible can happen to you, and yet, the day after this something terrible, the sun still rises, and life goes on. And therefore, so must you’, he writes. He believes he became adept at keeping people alive who have passed after losing his parents and brother so early. ‘I think this is healthy. I can’t stand when the dead are talked about in hushed tones or banished from our thoughts’. Everlasting love: Martin has the sense that ‘Nancy has only slipped away into the next room’.  He was dating Gilda Radner when he met Nancy in Toronto, who stepped in as Gilda's understudy . The conversation with Nancy continues: . ‘Nan, can you believe that you’ve been gone for four years’? ‘Has it been that long’? ‘Absolutely’. ‘Are you having a cocktail, baby’? ‘I sure am’. ‘Is that your first’? ‘It sure isn’t. And it may not be my last. So judge not’! ‘Hey, I don’t judge’. ‘Yeah, right’. ‘Aren’t you a happy boy’! (The cocktail glass is refilled.) ‘Nan’? ‘Ya, Mart’? ‘Where’d you go’? There was no answer this time because he asked the unanswerable. And he wasn’t expecting an answer. ‘There’s still life to be lived, laughs to be had, children to cherish, dear friends to be gossiped about, and costars to be upstaged’, Short writes. ‘As for the grander questions, their answers will surely reveal themselves’. Short’s acting credits include: !Three Amigos!, Father of the Bridge, TV’s Damages, numerous talk-show, prime-time and theatrical appearances and his one-man Broadway hit Martin Short: Fame Becomes Me.","SNL icon Martin Short met actress Nancy Dolma in 1974.

"A former chef's identity was stolen by an online troll who used Facebook to con people into believing his best friend, who was recovering from an illness, had died. Derek Evans, 57, from Cowbridge in south Wales, was shocked to discover he had posted news of his friend Leighton John's death on the site - especially because he had never gone online in his life. The friends were on the Greek island of Zante on a two-week holiday when the message was posted, devastating family members. Leighton's daughter Keely Jones, 30, was reduced to a 'sobbing wreck' when she learned her father, who suffers a crippling stomach ulcer condition, was dead. Dozens of friends paid their respects online and called his family before it was revealed to be fake. Best friends Derek Evans, left, and Leighton John, right, were on holiday when a troll posted a message on Facebook in Mr Evans name saying his friend had died . Mr Evans and Mr John, 64, who is nicknamed 'Bones,' have never owned a computer, set up an e-mail account or even set up landlines in their homes. Despite this, when a page was created in Mr Evans's name, accompanied by a recent photograph, claiming his friend had 'sadly passed away', nobody suspected it was false. The troll claiming to be Derek joined the Cowbridge Hub, a group highlighting the town's attractions, to ensure hundreds of people saw the message. And the identity thief took down the post before police were able to examine it. The identity thief posted this message and joined a local page to ensure hundreds saw the post and paid tribute . The troll also used a recent picture of Mr Evans, from Cowbridge, as a profile picture to convince friends . Mr Evans said: 'I've never owned a computer or got a Facebook page. I've never even been online, and I definitely never will be now. This is character assassination. 'I've got no idea where this person got the picture of me from and how or why they're doing this. But it's not the first time.' Last year, the same con was used to make it appear Mr Evans wished the death of a local soldier who had just been posted to Afghanistan. Mr Evans said the troll's attack, which has happened before,  is 'character assassination' 'Somebody came up to me in Tesco's, prodded me in the back in outrage and demanded to know what right I had to say such a thing,' he said. 'I'd no idea what they were talking about and, quite understandably, it took a while to calm the person down. 'I reported it to the police then, but nobody was ever caught. Now the person is back and they seem intent on causing as much pain and misery as possible.' Mr John added the attack was 'totally disgusting'. 'Keely was absolutely hysterical thinking I was dead,' he said. 'A sobbing wreck. I've not heard her cry like that since she was a little girl. This was totally disgusting.' He added: 'That holiday was meant to be a pick-me-up. I'd been in and out of hospital since Christmas and had lost 4st. All this put the damper on things. 'The fact I'd been so ill and it appeared like Derek was making some announcement, after we'd gone to Greece, made it seem all the more likely.' He said family eventually tracked down a mobile phone number and called to speak with Derek, and the truth came out. A police spokesman said the case was being investigated. 'The Facebook account has been closed down, however, if any further posts appear we have advised that a screen shot be taken to help enable us identify who has set up this account in Mr Evans name,' he said.","Troll made profile in Derek Evans's name and posted Leighton John died .

"Californian daredevil Ron Patrick has installed a 1,500 jet engine into the back of his new-shape VW Beetle, providing it with extreme acceleration. Patrick, 47, fitted the massive engine to the back of the small hatchback at a cost of $200,000. With the new infusion of power, the car is well able to exceed the the 140mph maximum speed measured by the car's on-board speedometer. Ron Patrick, left, standing beside his monster engine, spent $200,000 on his unusual creation . Patrick regularly enjoys taking his car for a spin at night where it is regularly pulled over by curious police officers . The amazing car has 1,500bhp - 500 more than a Bugatti Veyron and 1,400 horsepower more than a Beetle . Under full power, the car shoots out a 50ft trail of flame when the afterburners are engaged. The car, which is road legal is a firm favourite at motoring shows in California although he does take it on late-night cruises around Silicon Valley. However, he is regularly pulled over by traffic police who want additional information about the unusual vehicle. He is now planning several other jet-powered vehicles. He said: 'It isn't as difficult as you would think to fit a jet engine to a car. 'I'm a mechanical engineer by profession and I have studied quite a few books. 'I spent around $25k (£15k) on the car and $25k (£15k) on the engine but then another $150k (£94k) in parts. Inside the rear of the car where the back seat should be, instead this has been replaced by an air inacke . Inside the front of the car, Patrick has fitted several additional dials and switches for controlling the engine . 'The car has a universal appeal to everyone, it's a little bit of hell wrapped up in metal. 'It is road legal since the only pertinent law has to do with how much things can stick out the back of the car, in California, the law says 14' and my VW Beetle is 13'. 'It isn't any more or less difficult driving with a jet engine in place, I'd say you just have to be careful when backing up. 'People love the car because I think it appeals to people's imagination, even the birds refuse to poop on it.'

Patrick was forced to weld in additional reinforcing struts in the rear of the car to cope with the crazy power .

"The bizarre moment a cat-like wild genet hitched a ride on some of Africa’s biggest beasts has been captured by a hidden camera trap. The animal was spotted riding around on the back of both a rhino and a buffalo. And while its exact motives were unknown, it has been suggested that it may perch there and wait for small prey to be flushed out by the beasts before pouncing. A genet has been photographed on top of African beasts in South Africa. The remarkable incident took place at Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park In the images the genet can be seen hitching a ride on a rhino (shown) and a buffalo . The amazing incident took place at Hluhluwe-Imfolozi Park in South Africa . But the peculiar antics would have gone unnoticed if it wasn't for a well-placed hidden camera set up by local conservation organisation, Wildlife Act, that uses the traps to monitor endangered species and help catch would be poachers. Incredibly, the strange moment was caught on camera not once but twice and Wildlife Act's volunteer rangers are confident it is the same genet each time. In fact, the rangers believe this is the first time behaviour like this has ever been recorded in the wild. A genet is a mammal that resembles a cross between a cat and a mongoose. They have spotted coats, long banded tails, small heads and large ears. They are very agile and have very quick reflexes, with excellent climbing skills. In the images the type of animal is a large-spotted genet. They mostly dwell in trees and prey on birds, frogs, insects and rodents according to National Geographic. And they have apparently also been known to kill baby antelopes despite their much smaller size. The feline, which has since been named Jackson - genet is pronounced 'jen-it' - has even become something of an online celebrity and now has its own Twitter account. In the images the cat-like creature is seeing riding atop both a rhino and a buffalo. Other species have been spotted interacting before, notably impala and baboons, with the former using the latter as an ‘alarm system’. But according to Zoë Luhdo at Wildlife Act, this is the first time these two species have been seen together. ‘What makes it even more interesting, is that it’s not the first time this has happened,’ she writes. ‘According to other camera trap images this is ongoing behavior by the same genet.’ Camera traps are used to monitor wildlife without invading on their privacy. They are triggered by movement and use a non-irritating flash. Studying the photographs can reveal the movements and behaviour of animals when they are not otherwise observed. Incredibly, the strange moment was caught on camera not once but twice and Wildlife Act's volunteer rangers are confident it is the same genet each time .

But according to Zoë Luhdo at Wildlife Act, this is the first time these two species have been seen together.‘What makes it even more interesting, is that it’s not the first time this has happened,’ she writes . Although a little baffled by the bizarre behaviour, Dr Simon Morgan, an expert working for Wildlife Act, does have one theory on why the nocturnal animal appears so keen to make friends. He said: 'It is probably the same genet as the photos were taken at the same camera trap site. 'As far as we are aware this is the first recorded behaviour like this but we would love to know if anyone else has recorded something similar. 'We were so surprised that we caught it again and again on camera at exactly the same place. 'It was even more surprising that it does so on more than one animal and more than one species. 'We are not sure what is happening here but after looking at the photos you can see that in some images, the genet is literally going along for a ride, while in a few others the genet is near the head. Look familiar? Simba from the Lion King is seen hitching a ride on an ostrich here in a slightly more fanciful example of two species bonding together . A genet (stock image shown) is a mammal that resembles a cross between a cat and a mongoose. They have spotted coats, long banded tails, small heads and large ears . 'It could be similar behaviour to cattle egrets which go for a ride and wait for the large animal to flush insects. In this case the genet could be using this vantage point to spot small prey and so could be picking ticks of the animals ears,' said Dr Simon Morgan of Wildlife Act . Since the amusing images have come to light, the group are now planning to put a remote video camera trap in the same location to see if they can record the behaviour more accurately .

"Before coming out as a transgender female, Kellie was better known as international boxing promoter Frank Maloney, who took Lennox Lewis to become the undisputed Heavyweight Champion of the world. Earlier this year she shocked the macho world of boxing by announcing her decision to change her sex and live as a woman. Kellie, 61, is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman. This week she had a state-of-the-art semi-permanent make-up treatment at Harley Street clinic Debra Robson LDN. Scroll down for video . Transformation: Kellie Maloney has undergone a two-hour semi-permanent make-up treatment  to create more feminine features on her eyebrows, eye line and lips . She underwent the two-hour semi-permanent make-up treatment  to create more feminine features on her eyebrows, eye line and lips. The two-hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment, which claims to add a more feminine defined arch, a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes, and a lip treatment, which promises to re-shape and boost the natural lip colour. During the treatment Kellie said: 'If I hadn’t come-out as a woman, I wouldn’t be laying here on a beauty clinic treatment bed, I would be laying on a slab in an undertakers. That was the choice I had, it was either let it beat me and have the depression kill me or come out and embrace the world.' 'On my way to the clinic today, some girls stopped me and said they really admired what I was doing and how brave I was. But I don’t put it down to bravery, I put it down to being a necessity of what I had to do.' Glamorous: Kellie, 61, is now undergoing a raft of cosmetic treatments to become a woman before her final sex change operation in January . Spot the difference: The two-hour appointment included an eyebrow treatment which added a more feminine defined arch, a treatment to accentuate and widen her eyes, and a lip treatment, which re-shaped and boosted the natural lip colour (left, after, right, before) Kellie admitted that the semi-permanent make-up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she isn't yet an expert at doing her own make-up. And she added: 'I find it really hard to do eyeliner, I smudge it every time, and this will help me so that when I get up out of bed in the morning I don’t have to spend so much time doing my make-up, and I’ve always wanted my eyebrows to have a more feminine arch and look more natural - and hopefully a bit more beautiful. 'When I was Frank I tried to keep my eyebrows quite fine, and I always wanted to have arches. I was quite vain as Frank but now I’m even vainer as Kelly.' Process: Kellie admitted that the semi-permanent make-up treatment was going to be a great help for her because she isn't yet an expert at doing her own make-up . In action: Since coming out as a woman this August, Kellie, pictured being treated by Debra, said she has looked to female role models like Lorraine Kelly, Charlotte Hawkins and Suzannah Reid to model herself and her new look on . To prepare for the treatment Kellie had her eyebrows and lips covered with an anesthetic cream for 20 minutes, then the shape and size of the eyebrows were carefully measured and the outline of the new shape was created with an eyebrow pencil. When Kellie was happy with the shape, Debra started the treatment with a pen device which holds ultra-fine needles. Debra matched the chosen pigments to the natural colour of Kellie’s eyebrows, and with precisely simulated hair strokes, create a defined lift to the arch of the brow - Kellie said this would be similar to that of daughters Sophie, 19 and Libby, 13. Since coming out as a woman this August, Kellie said she has looked to female role models like Lorraine Kelly, Charlotte Hawkins and Suzannah Reid to model herself and her new look on, but she admitted during the treatment that the most important influence on her is from female members of her close family. Helping hand: With the new semi-permanent make-up, Kellie admitted most people don't think she looks like a man anymore . Kellie said: 'To be honest, my three daughters are my role models and they help me! Also my mum has been totally unbelievable since she was told about 15 months ago. Power Brow from £760 . Eye Intensifier (top and bottom lid) £1,000 . Kiss Proof Lip treatment £1,270 . Total: £3,030 . 'My two eldest ones, who are quite big now, don’t call me dad, but my 13-year-old she still does. I still get a few funny looks but as people recognise me as Kellie now so they don’t pay me as much attention.' And she added: 'My mother tells me not to wear heavy make-up every day, she tells me I must let my skin breathe. My mother hardly wears much make-up - a little bit of lipstick and bit of powder, and she’d just wear a bit of Nivea cream and she still uses it today, she’s 81 and she’s got beautiful skin. She looks like she’s in her 60s. We are very close now and she’s very protective of me and she sits and shows me pictures of her when she was younger and she’s stunning. 'When I look at my daughters and I think what fun they have, and how they look, I think I will never experience that, but the experience I have now is like starting all over again. 'My three daughters are very helpful for me getting my style right and I sit and watch the TV presenters, and shows like Sex and The City and Friends and I would model myself on them. 'I would walk along and watch women walking along the street and how they dress. When I first came out, I would never wear jeans. I wanted to look natural but unfortunately I’m very recognisable.' Selfie: Kellie captures a quick snap with Debra mid-way through her treatment . But with the new semi-permanent make-up, Kellie admitted most people don’t think she looks like a man anymore. Kellie added: 'I wonder what my colleagues would think now if they can see the semi-permanent make-up treatment that I’ve had? I’ve heard a few stories from people in the boxing world who think it’s all one of Frank Maloney big stunts and that I’ve fooled you all and I want to stay as Frank. 'But I think to myself they have got to be crazy, no human being would put themselves through some of the treatment that I’ve been having - the hormones, the electrolysis, the operations - this semi-permanent treatment is fine, but the other stuff isn’t nice. 'And I’m going to have surgery in Belgium in November on my nose because my nostrils are too big and they are going to lift the eyes and then on January 13th I’m going to have my operation and breasts done. 'But I’m so pleased with the semi-permanent make-up I’ve had, my face looks so much more feminine now. I’ll definitely come back to have a top up a couple of times a year.'

"It's been some battle - with some glorious moments along the way - but the ultimate race between Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo may soon be coming to an end. The world's best two players have been going head-to-head to break Raul's all-time Champions League goal record - which stands at a whopping 71. Messi has to be the firm favourite to overtake Raul first by sheer virtue of the fact that his Barcelona side take on Apoel Nicosia the night before Real Madrid play Basle later this month, and he is also one goal ahead of his rival. Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are battling it out to reach the top of the Champions League scoring charts on their own . Messi lining up a strike on goal against Ajax in the Champions League on Wednesday night - he scored twice in a 2-0 victory . Messi celebrates with Barca team-mate Pedro after scoring against Ajax in the Champions League . The Argentina international celebrates scoring four goals against Arsenal in April 2010 at the Nou Camp . Joint 1st: Lionel Messi (Barcelona) - 71 goals; Raul (Real Madrid, Schalke) - 71 . 3rd: Cristiano Ronaldo (Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 70 . 4th: Ruud van Nistelrooy (PSV Eindhoven, Manchester United, Real Madrid) - 56 . 5th: Thierry Henry (Monaco, Arsenal, Barcelona) - 50 . Messi drew level with the Real Madrid legend Raul having scored a double in Barcelona's 2-0 win against Ajax on Wednesday night. The Barcelona star  reached the total - despite playing 52 fewer games. Ronaldo had a chance to to equal Raul's record before Messi as he was named in the Madrid side who faced a makeshift Liverpool side a day earlier. But Karim Benzema scored the only goal of the game as 29-year-old Ronaldo drew a blank. Real and Barcelona have already safely booked their passage through to the last 16 of the Champions League so the attention turns to Raul's record in the next round of fixtures for the Spanish giants. Ronaldo, who recently won the Golden Shoe, has also taken 147 games more to score 400 career goals, with Messi reaching the same total in just 506 games. However, the former Manchester United forward only took 140 games to score 150 La Liga goals, whereas it took Messi 203 games to reach that tally. Whatever happens it is set to be a truly remarkable climax to this latest duel between the two, but if Messi does set a new all-time Champions League scoring record before Ronaldo, the debate will still rage on as to who is the greatest of the two.

"A photograph uncovered among records from World War I shows a fresh-faced soldier taking a picture of himself in front of a bedroom mirror. Just months later, the 21-year-old soldier was shot down during an air battle over Germany along with a comrade from No 4. Squadron. His story, and haunting photo, has been released ahead of Remembrance Day next week, and to commemorate 2014 as the 100-year anniversary since the start of the Great War. This image was taken by Australian soldier Thomas Baker in 1918 while fighting in Europe. Mr Baker joined the war effort in France in July 1916 before training to be a pilot and becoming a flight commander for No.4 squadron at the age of 20. He died in a battle over Germany on 4 November 1918 aged just 21 . The photo was taken by Australian soldier Thomas Baker who arrived in France on 1 July 1916 at the age of 19. He was involved in the campaign to fight on the Somme and won the Military Medal near Gueudecourt on 11 December that year for repairing a telephone line in thirty separate places under intense enemy fire. A year later, he added a Bar to his military medal after putting out a fire in an ammunition store under constant artillery fire. Records reveal he was particularly praised because his quick actions prevented 'certain disaster'. Mr Baker was the eldest son of schoolmaster and farmer Richmond Baker, and his wife Annie Martha from Smithfield, South Australia, . He joined the 11th Royal Australian Engineers of the Citizens Military Force on 29 July 1915 and began the war as a reinforcement gunner to the 6th Field Artillery Brigade. Thomas Charles Richmond Baker was born in Smithfield, South Australia, 2 May 1897. He was the eldest son of Richmond Baker, a schoolmaster and farmer, and his wife Annie Martha (née Gardner).

He won the Military Medal near Gueudecourt on 11 December 1916 for repairing a telephone line in thirty separate places under intense enemy fire. In September 1917, Baker joined the Australian Flying Corps and applied to become an air mechanic. He was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training. He was promoted to temporary captain and made a flight commander in No. 4 Squadron on 24 October. On 4 November 1918, the whole of No. 80 Wing RAF - of which No. 4 Squadron was part - took to the sky in an effort to 'harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road' and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of Leuze. Mr Baker led a formation of 'Sopwith Snipes' that had been chosen as a bomber escort when the initial raid was carried out. The battle raged for two or three minutes before dying out. As the Snipes re-grouped, they discovered that two pilots were missing. Mr Baker and fellow ace Lieutenant Arthur Palliser were initially recorded as missing, but were later found to have fallen victim to German ace, Karl 'Rittmeister' Bolle. The 21-year-old was credited with 12 victories, including seven aircraft and one balloon destroyed with an additional four planes driven down out of control. He was No. 4 Squadron's fourth highest scoring ace and on 8 February 1919, the London Gazette carried the posthumous announcement of the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross to Thomas Baker. Towards the end of WWI, Mr Baker joined the Australian Flying Corps and applied to become an air mechanic. He was instead selected to become a pilot and was posted for flight training, graduating on 27 March. On 16 August he participated in the largest Ariel attack of the war and was promoted to temporary captain and flight commander in No. 4 Squadron on 24 October. On 4 November 1918, the whole of No. 80 Wing RAF - of which No. 4 Squadron was part - took to the sky in an effort to 'harass the German retreat on the Leuze-Ath road' and to bomb the aerodrome to the east of Leuze.

"Like the old saying goes: if you hang out with chickens, you're going to cluck. It should come as no surprise then that Crackle, a six month old pig from Darwin, has started acting like a dog after spending all his time with a blue healer named Tyson. The owner of the pig Terry Cox told Daily Mail he picked Crackle up after a call from his local RSPCA. Crackle was picked up from Darwin RSPCA when he was seen wandering around town . Crackle was quick hit it off with Tyson, a 10-year old blue heeler. But soon the pig started to copy everything Tyson did, including playing fetch . 'The manager from my local branch called me up a couple of months ago and offered him to me. He had been spotted around town a couple of times, but nobody had managed to catch him. 'He was four months old at the time, and he was just a tiny little thing. I figured why not.' Crackle was quick hit it off with Tyson, a 10-year old blue heeler. But it soon became apparent that Crackles was having somewhat of an identity crises. 'Crackle started copying everything Tyson does. He jumps and sits on my lap when I'm watching Telly, he follows me around the house, he plays fetch.' 'The funniest thing is the barking. He's genuinely learned to bark. Even my neighbours have said it-it sounds exactly the same as Tyson. He even makes growling noises.' Terry Cox says that Crackle has learned to bark and growl in a way that sounds exactly the same as his canine counterpart . Terry says pigs are great household pets. He believes that they are very smart and are easier to train that dogs . Terry Cox says he gave Crackle a home after the manager from his local RSPCA called and asked if he was interested in taking him in . Mr Cox also owns eight chickens and for Barramundi, and he says that pigs are a great option for a household pet. 'They're very smart. You still need to train them, obviously, but I'd say they might be easier to train than dogs.' It's not the first time that pigs have imitated dogs. In 2011, there were reports of a pig named Louie that competes in dog talent shows in North Wales. In 2013, a story surfaced about Gilbert, a pig from Cheshire, who was raised with a pair of Yorkshire Terriers and started rolling over, begging for biscuits and bringing in the newspaper for its owner.

"The chairman of the social mobility and child poverty commission will call for priority to be given to low-income families concerning admissions . Schools should help poorer children jump the queue for places to break the middle-class stranglehold over admissions, according to a report fronted by the Coalition's social mobility tsar. Former Labour health secretary Alan Milburn, chairman of the social mobility and child poverty commission, will call for priority to be given to low-income families. In the report, Mr Milburn will criticise so-called 'selection by mortgage', where families can improve their chance of getting into a popular school by buying a home in the catchment area, saying the best schools should 'not just be for those who can afford to live nearby'. And he will urge schools to take advantage of new powers designed to prioritise children eligible for pupil premium funding – those who could have claimed free school meals at any point over the last six years. Academies and free schools can already use the new powers, and plans are underway to extend the freedom to all other state schools. Although there is currently no legal requirement for state schools to change their entry criteria, the report urges headteachers to prove that they are 'walking the walk on admissions'. The document – called 'Cracking the code: how schools can improve social mobility' – also cautions against putting off disadvantaged families by insisting on expensive uniforms and complicated application forms. It calls the extent to which disadvantaged youngsters are failing to get into top schools 'troubling', and warns schools that accepted methods of whittling down applicants – such as prioritising children in defined catchment areas or the offspring of staff members – could 'harm social mobility'. The report goes on to say: 'Giving priority to children who receive the pupil premium represents a clear public commitment that a school is serious about tackling disadvantage and improving social mobility. 'There is considerable academic evidence that attending an outstanding school – and avoiding an inadequate school – matters much more for those from disadvantaged backgrounds than for other children.' Mr Milburn added: 'Some schools have cracked the code on how to improve social mobility by helping disadvantaged children excel in education. If some schools can do it, there is no excuse for others not to.'

"Not long ago it was seen as a sign of scruffiness and incivility. But a shift in male fashion has led to a remarkable resurgence of the beard - and it appears not even royalty can resist the urge to grown one. Prince Felipe VI of Spain was pictured today with the neatly styled grey and black face fuzz he has sported since the summer, following his clean shaven coronation in June. A bearded King Felipe VI of Spain and Queen Letizia attend the launch of a Spanish dictionary in Madrid today . The monarch was photographed with wife Queen Letizia at the launch of a new Spanish dictionary at the Real Academia Española, in Madrid. His bold new look gives him  the crown as Europe's only bearded monarch - harping back to the days of his bearded namesake, Felipe II, who famously sent his Spanish Armada to conquer England in 1588. The king had intended to dispatch the force a year earlier, but a surprise attack from English sea captain Sir Francis Drake devastated his fleet after catching it unawares at Cadiz, southern Spain. The hugely successful raid earned the name - Singeing the King of Spain's Beard - after a conversation between Drake and Elizabeth I. When asking for permission to launch the surprise attack, the navigator is believed to have told the Queen he wished 'to singe the King of Spain's beard as it has grown somewhat too long'. The king appeared clean shaven at his coronation on June 19 this year but has recently been seen sporting a grey and black beard . A questionable wax model of King Felipe VI was recently unveiled in Madrid - the king has since become the only monarch in Europe to have a beard . The current monarch, Felipe VI, who succeeded to the throne on June 19 2014 following the abdication of his father, King Juan Carlos I, will no doubt hope his face fuzz brings him better luck. A model of the 43-year-old was recently unveiled at the Wax Museum in Madrid bearing a smooth face - without the king's salt and pepper beard. An English monarch has not sported a beard since George V - whose famous bushy whiskers were a thing of legend. George V, grandfather of Queen Elizabeth II, sported a bushy beard (left) while King Felipe II, the Spanish monarch who launched the Armada, was famously said to have had his beard singed by Sir Francis Drake . But with the current trend it seems only a matter of time before this changes. Both Prince William and Prince Harry have been known to grow face fuzz and earlier in the year the Queen issued Harry with an order to shave. Harry, 30, sprouted the beard last December while on his Walking With The Wounded charity trek to the South Pole - and the Queen was said to be displeased when he hadn't got rid of it a week later.

"A man who got off on a manslaughter charge after beating his woe to death has been ordered to pay their daughter millions in damages. Rafael Robb, 64, a highly respected University of Pennsylvania economics professor, admitted to bludgeoning his wife to death as she wrapped presents in their Wayne, Pennsylvania, home back in December 2006. And, as a result of a plea bargain, he was sentenced in November 2008 to just 5 to 10 years in prison for his horrific crime. Scroll down for video .

In fact, Robb beat his wife, Ellen, so badly with a chin-up bar that her brain was actually coming out of her skull and police on the scene thought she had been shot in the face. Now, a jury in Pennsylvania has made sure that Robb will have no quality of life once he does get released, awarding the couple's daughter Olivia, 20, a staggering $124.26 million in compensatory and punitive damages. This after an emotional three days of testimony where Olivia was forced to once again face her father and remember that tragic day which occurred eight years ago. Jurors cried openly according to NBC 10, as Olivia detailed her heartbreak and all the memories she will never had now that she has no mother. 'My mother was my best friend,' she said.

"An eight-year-old boy - nicknamed 'Jaws' by his friends - has grown a second row of teeth after suffering from a condition known as 'paediatric shark teeth'. Zak Brown, from Wakefield, West Yorkshire, must spend extra time brushing and visiting the dentist to maintain his two sets after his baby teeth did not fall out when his permanent teeth pushed through the gums. And Zak's condition also means he has suffered the cruel misfortune of not losing a tooth before growing too old to believe in the tooth fairy. However, he did lose his first baby tooth last week and it is hoped it will signal the start of normality for Zak. Scroll down for video . Zak Brown (pictured) has two rows of teeth - leading to the nickname 'Jaws' Zak has a second set of teeth growing behind his baby teeth on both his upper and lower jaws . His mother, civil servant Claire, 38, suspected something was wrong when he got his first extra tooth through. 'It looked really odd, and they kept on coming. All the while he wasn't losing his baby teeth.' What was actually happening inside Zak's mouth was that his permanent teeth, which would usually help push out baby teeth, were coming through. But instead they came in behind the first teeth and failed to move the baby ones out. So while his older sister, Niamh, 10, and younger brother, Finley, six, were cashing in on the tooth fairy, Zak was getting frustrated. She said: 'It did bother him. It doesn't hurt and he has no problems eating but he would complain and wish his teeth would come out whenever they lost a tooth. 'He was gutted. He would try and wiggle and wiggle his teeth to make them come out but nothing ever happened. 'But he's got used to it now. His friends call him 'Jaws' because he's got a second set of teeth just like sharks do.' Zak's first permanent tooth came through about a year ago, with the others following shortly after. The eight-year-old's first permanent tooth came through about a year ago, with the others following shortly after . Both she and Zak's father, engineer Richard, 45, from Leeds, West Yorkshire, were pleased when he finally lost his first baby tooth. She said: 'We gave him £10 to a-bait him. It's funny because he's so old now he doesn't even believe in the tooth fairy anymore.' Zak is such a showman that if anybody asks about his teeth, he is happy to show them. The footy-mad lad is now on a waiting list to get his baby teeth extracted to allow other adult to come through. He will then more than likely need a brace. But, she said: 'Unfortunately there is now a good two or three year wait to see the orthodontist. All children are born with 20 teeth know as the child's baby, or milk, teeth. These teeth usually start breaking through the gums and exposing when the child is about 6-months-old. They remain in the child's formative years but begin to fall out when they reach the age of five or six - often with the first to arrive being the first to go. As they start falling out, they are replaced by permanent teeth breaking through the gums. These remain with the child for the rest of their life. Permanent teeth are more yellow than baby teeth and they have longer roots. They also feature things called mamelons - these are the bumps on the edge of the permanent teeth which give them a serrated appearance. 'We have been told we can go private if we chose but I imagine that may cost a lot of money. 'It is something I'd like to sort out sooner rather than later, though, because although it doesn't hurt and he has no trouble eating it is starting to affect his speech slightly because he has too many teeth in his mouth.' The condition - known as paediatric shark teeth - can affect as many as one in 10 children although it is thought not many cases are as striking as Zak's. It occurs when an adult tooth doesn't exert enough pressure on the baby tooth it is under, or does not have enough room to emerge. It then takes the easier route and grows behind the baby teeth - causing the baby tooth root to take longer to dissolve and the child is left with two sets of teeth.","West Yorkshire eight-year-old suffers from 'paediatric shark teeth' condition .

"Blur frontman Damon Albarn last night waded into the row over Jeremy Clarkson's number plate scandal, describing the Top Gear presenter as an 'a**hole'. Speaking to fans ahead of a concert in Argentinian capital Buenos Aires, the singer apologised for Clarkson's behaviour, telling them that he thought the stunt was 'not cool'. Clarkson and his team were forced to flee the country last week after locals were incensed by the H982 FKL number plate on his Porsche, which they said was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: Blur frontman Damon Albarn, pictured left, described the Top Gear presenter as an 'a**hole' Albarn told the cheering crowd at the city's Gran Rex Theatre: 'I'm sure it was all in the press here but I want to really apologise for all the behaviour of a guy called Jeremy Clarkson who does a show called Top Gear.' Making a rude hand gesture, he added: 'He's a f***ing a***hole... not cool.' The row erupted when photos of Clarkson's FKL registration were posted on the internet by angry Argentinians who claimed the Top Gear presenter was mocking their country. The show's convoy was then attacked by a gang armed with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles, forcing Clarkson and fellow presenters James May and Richard Hammond to flee into Chile. Clarkson later took to Twitter insisting the number plate was a coincidence and was switched to a neutral plate - H1 VAE - as soon as the reference to the Falklands was spotted. But Argentinian police yesterday revealed that two further plates were later found inside his abandoned vehicle - one white and one yellow - bearing the registration number BE11 END. Row: Clarkson and fellow presenters Richard Hammond (left) and James May (far right) were forced to flee the country last week after locals were incensed by the H982 FKL number plate on his Porsche . The discovery throws Clarkson's claims that the plates were a coincidence into doubt after it emerged that the BBC has contacted the man who sold them the vehicle in an alleged 'cover-up'. A local official said: 'We know bellend doesn't mean the end of the bell and is a word used instead to describe the head of the penis which is often employed as an insult in England. 'We regard it as another insult to the people of Argentina. We're sure the Top Gear team were planning another provocation with the number plate in the same way they provoked us with the one referencing the Falklands War.' Controversy: The anger was sparked by the H982 FKL plate, which locals say was a reference to the 1982 Falklands War . It also emerged this morning that the Top Gear has told a car dealer who sold the crew the Porsche to pass on any enquiries about the sale to them. Mark Waring, of Surrey-based Rennsport Classics, told MailOnline: 'Top Gear contacted me and gave me the number of their press office to hand to anyone who contacted me.' The controversy over the alleged 'cover up' comes as Falklands War veterans in southern Argentina announced they would file a formal complaint to a court considering whether to open a criminal investigation for alleged falsification. Osvaldo Hillar, a member of the Commission of Falklands War veterans in Ushuaia, where Clarkson encountered most problems, confirmed the intention today. Forced out: The show's convoy was attacked by a gang armed with rocks, sticks and pickaxe handles . He said: 'I like to deal with things diplomatically and I want to see this through to the end and make sure justice is done because you don't cause offence to our dead and the question of the Malvinas. 'We will be filing a formal complaint to the courts and leaving it in the hands of the judicial system.' Clarkson admitted at the weekend the number plate on his Porsche was changed after the problems he experienced. Court sources in the city of Rio Grande, which is expected to announce next week if it is opening a criminal investigation, say the crime of falsification for using different number plates to those in a car's official documentation carries a prison sentence of six months to three years. Under fire: Argentinian Police have now revealed they have found another set of offensive number plates in the car. The discovery casts doubt over Jeremy Clarkson's claim that the original number plate was a coincidence . Federico Sciurano, mayor of Ushuaia, described last week's violence, which ended with the Top Gear team being stoned by angry locals as they drove towards Chile with a police escort, as a 'great mistake.' He said after Clarkson's departure: 'We have committed a great mistake with the violence. That never resolves anything and the impact it was going to have was not taken into account. 'Instead of talking today about a person who was trying to be clever, we're talking about the victimisation of that same person. 'Obviously I don't agree with violence and smashing windows of a car wasn't necessary. 'I believe the people responsible made a big mistake when they decided to act in that manner because now the news is that they decided to smash up the cars instead of talking about the real issue.'","Blur singer blasted Clarkson on stage ahead of show in Buenos Aires .

Their early holidays were rooted in Paignton, where they would stay in a static caravan. After  marrying and having children, the Lazenbys continued to visit for two weeks every year, staying at Louville Holiday Camp in Brixham and later at Waterside Holiday Park in Paignton. In 1990 they finally decided to buy their own caravan at Waterside so they could spend even more time in the area.

The 30-year-old Brazil international strongly denied the claims on his personal website and announced that he was taking legal action. The Corriere Della Sera said the former Manchester City player, who signed for the club in September 2008 in a £33 million deal, was under investigation over an alleged sexual assault.

"Charges may soon be laid in the case of toddler Daniel Thomas who, according to Victoria's coroner, was killed by his baby sitter as his mother failed to intervene. Homicide detectives have completed their investigation into Daniel's 2003 death in his home in the Victorian town of Myrtleford, north east of Melbourne, which was the subject of a coronial inquest earlier this year. Victoria Police have confirmed their fresh investigation into the child's death is now complete, and a file has been handed to the Office of Public Prosecutions. Charges are soon to be laid in the case of Victorian toddler Daniel Thomas who a coroner said was beaten and gagged to death in 2003 . Victoria Police have confirmed their fresh investigation into the Danile Thomas' death is now complete, and a file has been handed to the Office of Public Prosecutions . The Seven Network reported on Thursday a murder charge may soon be laid against Daniel's baby sitter Mandy Martyn. Daniel's mother Donna who was also implicated in the tragic case may also soon be charged with reckless conduct endangering life. 'Homicide Squad detectives have submitted a brief of evidence to the OPP for opinion in relation to their investigation into the death of Daniel Thomas,' said Victoria Police in a statement. 'Detectives will await the advice from the OPP and as such, we are not in a position to comment any further.' In July, Victoria's coroner found two-year-old Daniel died from abuse suffered at the hands of Ms Martyn, his baby sitter. The abuse over six weeks included the toddler being tied to his bed, locked in a cupboard, gagging and beatings, and his head being held under water. Donna Thomas has been blamed by a coroner for not doing enough to protect her son Daniel, who was found buried under a house five years after he went missing. She may be charged with reckless conduct endangering life . Daniel Thomas (pictured) endured abuse over six weeks which included the toddler being tied to his bed, locked in a cupboard, gagging and beatings, and his head being held under water, said the Victorian coroner . The coroner also found Ms Thomas contributed to Daniel's death by failing to protect her son. Jacinta Heffey said Ms Thomas and Daniel moved into Ms Martyn's Myrtleford home about six weeks before he died and throughout the period, Daniel, was subject to horrific abuse. Ms Heffey said Ms Thomas failed her son by remaining in the home and allowing the abuse to continue. 'She remained under the same roof as someone who systematically mistreated her own son and she manifestly failed to protect or console him,' she said. 'She chose to do nothing and allow the abuse to Daniel to continue.' Ms Heffey found Daniel's death was possibly caused by strangulation, drowning or a head injury but did not make a ruling on a specific cause. Daniel was reported missing by Martyn in October 2003. His remains were found in 2008, buried under the Myrtleford home where he and his mother had previously lived. The women have denied involvement.

"'Filthy': Isabell Telford, pictured, said that her new flat, owned by East Lothian Council, was 'not fit for human habitation' when she moved in . A mother-of-three claimed a council official told her to 'find herself a man' when she complained that work needed to be done to her new home. Isabell Telford was appalled when she moved into a flat in Newbigging, Musselburgh, earlier this year, describing it as 'filthy' and 'not fit for human habitation'. The 40-year-old said that the property, owned by East Lothian Council, had exposed pipes in the bathroom, tiles ripped off the walls and peeling wallpaper. She added that nails sticking up from the floorboards and the broken fence in the roof garden made it a dangerous place for her one-year-old grandson. When she complained to the council, Ms Telford was told that she would have to carry out repairs herself. But after she pointed out that she was not physically able to complete all the work, the council official told her that she should 'go get herself a man'. Ms Telford, who works night shifts as a carer and is also a PA during the day, claimed she has also been told by council workers give up work and go on benefits in order to get charity white goods for her home. She said: 'There was a council worker here, I can't remember if he was surveyor or what but I was asking him how he expected me to physically do some of the repairs needed. 'He said I should go and get myself a man for a couple of months to get it done. 'He started laughing but I told him I didn't find it funny at all.' Ms Telford moved into the flat with her sons Jordan, 17, and Daniel, 16, in May and claims it has taken her five months and hundreds of phone calls to get the council to eventually carry out some of the repairs need. She said: 'When I first saw the flat, coming in the door I was in tears. I said I would rather sleep in a tent outside with my bairns than sleep in here. 'It was filthy, it was stinking, it was not fit for human habitation but I had no choice but to take it. Dingy: Ms Telford said that the wallpaper in her flat in Newbigging, Musselburgh, was peeling off the walls when she moved into the flat earlier this year. She claimed it has taken months to have the repairs made . Run-down: Paint was peeling off from the walls, left, and pipes in the bathroom had been left exposed. The mother-of-three, who moved in with two of her children, said she was left in 'tears' when she first saw the flat . 'Horrendous': Ms Telford said that tiles on the bathroom wall had fallen off and had not been fixed. When she told council officials that she could not carry out the repairs herself, they told her to 'get herself a man' 'It was horrendous.' She said she was unable to look after her grandson Kye for her daughter Sarah, 23, for two weeks after she moved in due to the nails sticking up from the floorboards. Ms Telford said when she was offered the house she and her family were homeless and living in temporary accommodation in Tranent, East Lothian, after being forced to move from their previous private let when it was sold. Squalid: Damp on the walls and uneven floorboards made the property 'dangerous' for Ms Telford's one-year-old grandson, she said. She claimed council bosses also told her to stop working and collect benefits . She said: 'I just felt because I was homeless I was treated like scum. That's how it made me feel. 'Just because I've been in homeless accommodation doesn't make me scum. I work and I work hard and I've never been on benefits. 'I always knew the council was bad but I didn't think it was this bad.' An East Lothian Council spokeswoman said she could not discuss individual cases.","Isabell Telford, 40, moved into East Lothian Council flat earlier this year .

"West Australian premier Colin Barnett has been labelled 'nasty' and 'ungracious' by state MPs after he said former prime minister Gough Whitlam was not a 'great prime minister'. Following news this morning that Whitlam had died aged 98, Mr Barnett told a Perth breakfast program that while Whitlam was a transformative leader and a towering figure, his government had ended in chaos. 'He was not able to run a competent government - I don't think anybody could suggest that,' Mr Barnett said. 'He ended up with a government in chaos. Scroll down for video . The West Australian premier (left) made the remarks about former Prime Minister Gough Whitlam on Perth radio station 96fm . Unlikely friends: One time arch-rivals Gough Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser became mates later in life, despite the controversy surrounding the 1975 dismissal . 'Thank you Gough!' A tribute left on the steps of Old Parliament House . 'It was a very tumultuous time. It was a time of government spending a lot of money and I think there was a fair bit of waste. 'I don't think Gough should really be remembered as a great prime minister.' 'I think he changed our thinking and he modernised Australia but a lot of the things that he set out to do didn't really work.' 'There were grand spending programs that didn't really come off. 'He didn't lead his government well but he certainly painted a big new modern picture for Australia. For that he deserves his place in history,' he said. 'He was physically and literally a towering figure in Australian politics. Many state Labor MPs responded furiously. Rita Saffioti, the state member for West Swan, tweeted: 'Premier's comments on Gough Whitlam today totally inappropriate and disrespectful. Shows what type of person Barnett is.' Ben Wyatt, the member for Victoria Park, tweeted: 'As far as I can tell, the only nasty ungracious commentary on the passing of Whitlam is from the Western Australian Premier.' Whitlam was lionised by many Federal MPs in tributes today. Senior Federal MPs on both sides of the aisle, including Tony Abbott, Malcolm Turnbull, Bill Shorten, Chris Bowen and Tanya Plibersek, praised his character and recounted amusing stories of his leadership. Australia mourns the passing of its 21st Prime Minister, the Honourable Edward Gough Whitlam AC QC. We remember his lifetime of service to Australia in the Royal Australian Air Force, as a parliamentarian, as Prime Minister and as an ambassador. Gough Whitlam was a giant of his time. He united the Australian Labor Party, won two elections and seemed, in so many ways, larger than life. In his own party, he inspired a legion of young people to get involved in public life. He established diplomatic relations with China and was the first Australian Prime Minister to visit China. China is our largest trading partner. That is an enduring legacy. Gough Whitlam recognised the journey that our country needed to take with indigenous Australians. The image of soil passing from Gough Whitlam's hand to Vincent Lingiari's is a reminder that all Australians share the same land and the same hopes. Gough Whitlam's life was inseparable from that of Margaret Whitlam. Margaret Whitlam was a leading light for women of her generation. Together they made a difference to our country. On this day we honour a life of service to our country. I have instructed all flags to fly at half-mast today and on the day of Mr Whitlam's State Memorial Service. Further details on how Australians can honour Mr Whitlam will be announced in coming days in consultation with the Whitlam family. On behalf of the Australian people, I extend my condolences to the Whitlam family on their loss. Sydney shock jock Alan Jones was critical of Whitlam's economic management . But Mr Barnett was not alone in his criticism of the Labor prime minister, who occupied the nation's top job from 1972 until his controversial dismissal in 1975. Sydney 2GB talkback radio host Alan Jones described Whitlam as the 'charismatic leader' of the Labor Party and a 'visionary in many ways' but criticised his economic management. He praised the Whitlams for their 'significant dignity' after they were unceremoniously dismissed from the role in 1975. 'One of the commendable features of it all is the dignity he and his wife accepted the indignity of being dismissed from office,' he said. But he told listeners the former Labor leader did not know much about the economy. 'He did in fact, in many ways damage the Australian economy by its absence of any prime-ministerial control over the direction of the economy,' Jones said.","WA Premier blasted for being critical of Gough Whitlam .

"Airline food is notoriously bad, with most passengers forcing it down because at 30,000 feet, there are simply no other culinary options. So the idea that some would actually want to consume it at ground level - where a huge variety of delicious, fresh, non-mystery meat options are available - is a surprising one. Nevertheless, German food delivery website Allyouneed.com has launched Air Food One in collaboration with Lufthansa Airlines' caterers, delivering an aeroplane meal once a week to customers. Airplane food on the ground: A new German delivery service provides meals from the plane in your home . A class above: Unlike the unidentifiable dishes in economy though, the meals are the same as those offered to Business Class passengers . But far from the unidentifiable meats, bland sauces and soggy vegetables the average economy flyer is begrudgingly accustomed too, the meals are actually from Business Class. Just like on the plane, you can choose from the regular or vegetarian option. Every Wednesday, customers will receive delivery of the same meal being served to passengers sitting up front on Lufthansa that week. Familiar:  This is the sort of meal the average flyer is usually faced with on flights . Options: Customers are given a choice of regular or vegetarian options . The full meal costs €9.99 (approximately £7.85) per week and €8.99 (approximately £7.05) for vegetarian. The food arrives cold and needs to be cooked in the oven before consuming. It is also suitable for freezing. On the menu next week is 'Chinese Shin of Beef', and 'Shak Navratan Indian Vegetables' for the vegetarian options. Cutting down on waste: Catering company LSG Sky Chefs reduces waste by using the surplus Business Class meals not ordered by passengers on board . Other upcoming dishes include 'Emperor Bream with Herb Risotto' or 'Panserotti with Ricotta', and 'Chicken Breast with Pepper' or 'Pumpkin Gnocchi with Ragout'. The service is much like any other ready meal delivery, except only one meal per week is currently available. The idea also cuts down on food waste for LSG Sky Chefs, the catering company behind the service, as the surplus meals not ordered by Business Class passengers are used to fill orders, rather than being thrown out.","Air Food One delivers one plane meal per week to customers for £7.85 .

"If a boy wrestling for a Catholic school in central Pennsylvania should find himself across from a female opponent on the mat, he'll have to forfeit under a new diocese policy.

Gainer outlined the new policy in a statement to the media. 'Preparation for Christian adulthood likewise involves  the development and encouragement of appropriate, dignified and respectful forms of contact between male and female students,' he said. 'The Diocese therefore believes that it is incompatible with its . religious mission and with its efforts to teach Gospel values to condone . competitions between young men and women in sports that involve . substantial and potentially immodest physical contact.'

That includes seven high schools. The move comes after several years of controversy over co-ed sports. The Archbishop of Philadelphia banned co-ed competition in Catholic Youth Organization football in 2013. The decision was reversed after an awareness campaign. Overall, female participation in high school wrestling is up. In the 2013-2014 school year there were 9,904 girls wrestling according to the National Federation of State High School Associations - up more than 2,000 from the 2010-2011 year.

Catholic school students are, however, allowed to face female opponents from opposing school's rugby teams and football teams.

"Ni Min, 14, suffers from the condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), or 'Stone Man Syndrome' A teenage girl with stiff joints has been told her tendons and muscles are turning to solid bone. Ni Min, 14, suffers from the condition fibrodysplasia ossificans progressiva (FOP), sometimes referred to as Stone Man Syndrome. It is so rare, there are fewer than 600 cases in the entire world - and Ni is one of the youngest. The teenager, from a village near the city of Yibin, in southern China's Sichuan Province, began showing symptoms at the age of eight - and saw a succession of doctors before being diagnosed. Her family had become concerned about the strange lumps that were appearing under her skin and her gaunt appearance. Finally, specialists at Tongji Hospital in Shanghai revealed she was suffering from Stone Man Syndrome. The disease, which has no cure, is considered one of the most disabling genetic conditions. It causes bone to form in muscles, tendons, ligaments and other connective tissues. Over time, this extra bone progressively restricts movement, forming a second skeleton that imprisons the body in bone. It eventually results in a gruesome death when the  cartilage holding the ribs together also solidifies, making it impossible to breathe. The patients eventually suffocate or suffer massive cardiac arrest as their bodies attempt to get enough oxygen. The most famous case of the syndrome was in a man called Harry Eastlack, who began to suffer at the age of 10. By the time he died at 39, his body had almost completely turned into bone, leaving only his lips intact. Mr Eastlack asked that his body be donated to researchers looking for a cure for the illness after his death. People with the syndrome need to be careful to avoid injury. Any swelling or inflammation will be quickly 'repaired' by the body by replacing the tissue with bone. If the extra bone growth is surgically removed, the body will replace the removed bone at a faster pace as well. Despite the poor prognosis, doctors treating Ni say they hope to delay the onset of her symptoms, in a bid to prolong her life. Scroll down for video .

'We will see how that goes over the next six months and will review it based on the way her body reacts.' The family have been given further hope now a new medicine for treating FOP is under trial in the U.S. It is expected to hit the market next year. Dr Zhang added: 'We hope this new drug will help. 'Patients usually die in their 40s when they can no longer breathe because of the pressure on their lungs.' Ni Min's grandmother, Li Yuanchao, 65, has been a tireless campaigner for her granddaughter, taking her to medical appointments across the country in the hope of a diagnosis - and a cure.

"The number of children adopted under four years old has gone up by 70 per cent since 2010. (File image) The number of children adopted from state care has risen by almost 60 per cent in four years to more than 5,000 – the highest level since modern records began. It is a triumph for former Education Secretary Michael Gove’s new rules sweeping away barriers blocking adoption on racial or bureaucratic grounds. Figures released yesterday showed 5,050 children were adopted in the year to the end of March, an increase of 26 per cent in a year and 58 per cent since 2010. The number of children adopted under four years old has gone up by 70 per cent since 2010. There are now more adoptions than at any time since comparable records began in 1992. The breakthrough follows years of decline in adoption as social workers insisted children in state care should only go to families of the same racial or cultural background. Adoptions were also blocked on the grounds that prospective parents were too old, or that they smoked, or even that they were too middle class. Critics said children were being damaged by being forced to live in care homes or with a succession of foster families because social workers had an ideological dislike of adoption. After the appointment in 2010 of Mr Gove – who was brought up by adoptive parents – guidance was changed to speed up adoption and remove barriers such as race, age or class. Adoption falls under children’s services covered by the Department for Education. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, who replaced Mr Gove in July, said the rise in adoptions – which had fallen to 3,100 in 2011 – meant thousands more vulnerable children were finding homes. She said: 'These figures show a significant and sustained rise in the number of adoptions – an increase of 26 per cent in the last twelve months. 'This means thousands more of our most vulnerable of children finding the loving and permanent homes they so desperately need. ‘We also promised to remove delay and frustration from the process for both children and adopters. Today’s figures show that we are delivering on that promise. Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, left, who replaced Mr Gove, right, in July, said the rise in adoptions – which had fallen to 3,100 in 2011 – meant thousands more vulnerable children were finding homes . 'The system is working more quickly, as well as providing more support to families after an adoption has taken place.’ On average a child entering the care system who is adopted waited two years of four months before becoming legally part of their new family. However, the waiting time has gone down by two months over the past year. The difficulties for children brought up in state care who do not win adoption can be highly damaging. In 2012 figures showed that a third of children living long-term in state care failed to learn to read by the time they were seven. Seven out of eight failed to reach the benchmark for a decent education, five A*-C passes at GCSE or equivalent including English and maths. One in five were not up to date with immunisations, and almost the same proportion had not been to a dentist in a year. Yesterday’s figures showed that among 27,220 young people who spent their childhood in the care system and are now aged 19,20, and 21, nearly four out of 10 are NEETs – not in education, employment or training. Figures also showed the number of children in care rose to 68,840 last year, up by seven per cent on 2010 levels.","Number adopted from state care at highest level since records began in 1992 .

"An American woman who was extradited from Australia after disappearing with her daughter 20 years ago has pleaded not guilty abduction in her first  appearance at a US court. Dorothy Lee Barnett, 54, was found and arrested in Queensland last year after she vanished with her 10-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994 after taking her to a birthday party. Ms Barnett was found by Australian and US police in November living on the Sunshine Coast with her daughter Savanna Todd, now aged 20, living under the name Samantha Geldenhuys. Dorothy Lee Barnett (left) was found by Australian and US police in November living on the Sunshine Coast with her daughter Savanna Todd (right) after allegedly abducting her 20 years ago. She denied the charges during her first court appearance in Charleston, South Carolina today . The Australian Federal Government said she be surrendered to US authorities and now faces a count of parental kidnapping and two counts of falsifying US passport applications. Authorities allege that she did not have custody of her daughter when she fled. She entered plea before U.S. Magistrate Bristow Marchant in Charleston, South Carolina, while her attorney requested a bond hearing be delayed. Russell W. Mace III said he needs time to contact Barnett's family and friends from outside the state and country to come vouch for his client. Mace told the judge his client had been back since Friday and he only met her for the first time Saturday. He told reporters later that he has been in contact with Barnett by telephone since she was arrested and jailed in Australia last November. He would not comment further. Ms Barnett allegedly did not have custody of Savanna when she took her from her American father to attend a birthday party and failed to return in 1994 . Barnett appeared before the judge in a gray-striped prison jumpsuit and there were shackles on her hands as she signed the court papers acknowledging her plea. She did not comment except to tell the judge she understood both the charges and that she would have to remain in jail at least until the bond hearing. Conviction on the charges carries a maximum penalty of 30 years. She was found in Australia last year where she had been living under several aliases. Ms Barnett and Savanna's father Benjamin Harris Todd separated in 1993, with the mother being granted two supervised weekend visits a month for their daughter. Ms Barnett (pictured left in the 90s and right in an artist impression) was located and arrested in Queensland last year after she disappeared with her 10-month-old baby from South Carolina in 1994 . It's alleged Ms Barnett abducted their daughter on the fifth visitation. When she was arrested Ms Barnett initially agreed to be extradited but she later backed down. Her lawyers asked the government to prevent the extradition, but Federal Justice Minister Michael Keenan ruled this week she had to be surrendered. 'The Minister arrived at his determination following careful consideration of the provisions of Australia’s extradition law and taking into account representations made by, and on behalf of, Ms Barnett,' a government spokesman said. Savanna (pictured left as a baby and right now) was by her mother's side during a court appearance last year when she was denied bail.

I got on a plane to visit their camp in Ibiza – it's only a two hour flight and a short car ride and there I was – at their luxury villa near Santa Eularia. The weigh in came as a shock on day one – 13 stone. Not good. This is ½ stone more than I weighed from my Men's Health challenge, and I've lost a lot of muscle mass and gained fat. But at least I know that with some hard work and determination I can turn it round with a week or two at boot camp. Taking the strain: Spencer says that he has gained half a stone since his Men's Health cover shoot last year . I work out: Spencer lifts some weights and works up a sweat . Taking in the view: Spencer goes for a jog on the scenic Ibiza beach . The next morning everything starts with a bang. Loud pumping dance music wakes you (well it is Ibiza after all) at 7am, and if the relentless thud of the bass doesn't get you up the dulcet tones of former RAF Physical Training Instructor (PTI) Andy Morris will. Andy motivates all the campers with a special mix of discipline and peer group pressure. He's clearly turned down the volume on what he would have handed out to wannabe fighter pilots in the RAF - his No 1 Boot Camp style is much more about encouragement and getting the best out of people. And breathe: Spencer looks worn out after an intensive work out . Taking the plunge: Spencer cools off in the villa pool after a day of intense exercise . Out and about: Spencer explores the island while out on a trek . At 7.30am there is a fitness test in the grounds of the luxurious villa – which is running for 15 minutes, and then a test to see how many sit ups, push ups and burpees you can do. Then back for breakfast which consists of eggs, mushrooms and spinach – absolutely no toast, bagels or cereals. The food is wheat-free, gluten-free, sugar-free and unprocessed. Keeping focus: Spencer says that too much partying has lead him to gain weight and he is prepared to concentrate on his fitness from now on . Working up a sweat: Spencer pushes himself to the limit during an exercising session . Mind, body, soul: Spencer wants to stays in tune with his body . At 9.30 we move on to an hour long beach run. It looks more effortless and fun in the photos than it is in real life. It's harder to run on sand than it is on road, and your thighs soon feel the difference. There is a quick half hour break for some frozen watermelon and nutty energy balls and then it's straight on to gruelling triathlon circuits and sea swimming. If that's not enough, we then have to run back to the villa. I was exhausted. Lunch is quinoa and stuffed peppers and is tasty and provides a nutrient dense low-carb diet. They don't starve you here, you are given enough to eat, around 1,200 calories a day, but you are probably burning at least 2,000 with the work-outs so you are going to lose weight. Clean and lean: Spencer's Ibiza diet is completely gluten-free, sugar-free and unprocessed . After lunch it's a weights session followed by all-over resistance circuits – by 3.30pm the most painful bits of the day are done, and then it's down to some games around the pool, and the other campers were really friendly and up for a laugh. There was time for a bit of lounging by the pool and catching some rays. The weather is still sunny and warm, even though it's not summer any more, and the location and scenery are breathtakingly beautiful. Making mates: Spencer gushes over a dog during a break from exercising . Chilling: Spencer takes a well-earned break on a sun lounger after a hard day's work . Dinner at 6pm was a delicious Cajun baked salmon with mango and avocado salsa and then we settled down for movie night and bed by 9.30pm. Yes, I know that doesn't sound like me but if you don't get a good night's sleep your body simply won't cope the next day. I've got another week of this to go – if I can stick it out - and then hopefully I will be ripped up and in top shape again. I'll show you next week how I get on. All the best, .

"Victoria Beckham was named Britain's top entrepreneur last week with her empire expanding so fast it could eclipse her husband's . She was the Spice Girl who just ‘couldn’t sing’, but in her new career as a fashion designer, it seems that Victoria Beckham can do no wrong. Just last week she was named Britain’s top entrepreneur for building a business empire expanding so fast that it is eclipsing her footballing husband. And the cash has followed fast. The Beckham family fortune is put at £210 million – with Victoria responsible for £100 million of that. And some analysts conclude that she is out-earning David, particularly now that his playing days are over. It is a fitting reward for the hard work that has seen the annual turnover of her company, Victora Beckham Ltd, grow from a modest £1 million to £30 million in less than a decade. It has jumped from employing three people to a hundred. Figures are projected to soar following the recent opening of her retail store in Mayfair. Another outlet is planned for New York next year. Her clothes and accessories are by no means cheap – one of her handbags costs £18,000 (though this is nothing compared to the £130,000 cost of one bag in her own private collection). But celebrity fans such as Kate Winslet, Beyonce, and Sarah-Jessica Parker have inadvertently helped create a non-stop, and highly successful, advertising campaign for her VB brand. So, how did ‘Posh Spice’ rise from being Queen of the WAGs to become one of Britain’s leading businesswomen? Here the Mail on Sunday analyses the secrets of how she built up her business empire, how it makes its fortune – and how she invests it... Entertainment: The Spice is still right... Wannabe rich: Victoria in the movie she made with the Spice Girls (right). She earned £750,000 in royalties last year from the band - where she was referred to as the 'one who couldn't sing' Her Spice Girls singing career is fast becoming a distant memory. Yet continuing royalties gave her £750,000 last year. To date she has sold 100 million records worldwide and in 2007 Victoria netted a reported £10million from the group’s wildly successful reunion tour. Her 2001 autobiography and two other fashion and style books earned her at least £1 million. There was also a six-figure sum for a 2007 reality TV show, Coming To America, about the family’s move to Los Angeles. Adverts & endorsements: Every little million helps . Taking part in adverts (above for Tesco) has earned her £1million a year and she is due to link up with H&M . Victoria Beckham is seen in a billboard advertising campaign for Samantha Thavasa at Omotesando in 2007 . Few have the clout of the Beckhams when it comes to promoting products – whether theirs or someone else’s. Now it is rumoured that Victoria is due to link up with H&M – famous for her husband’s underwear. In 2009, she signed a £12 million, three-year deal with Armani. Two years later she was paid a reported £1 million for an advert for Japanese handbag designer Samantha Thavasa. She received a six-figure sum for designing a Range Rover, while the 2007 advert for Tesco netted her and fellow Spice Girls £1 million each. Fashion: The dresses that impress... From rags to riches, Victoria poses inside her central London boutique - the first in a series of stores . A pair of Victoria Beckham brand white jeans, which retail at £289. She also stocks a range of bags and shoes . Victoria's fashion business turned over a reported £30 million last year and made an estimated £3 million in profit, almost double the year before. Alongside an eye-wateringly expensive ready-to-wear collection sits a more affordable Victoria by Victoria Beckham, a range of denim, sunglasses, handbags, and now shoes and key rings costing between £150 to £485, which are exclusive to Victoria’s recently opened shop in Mayfair. Business analysts predict her business will be worth about £200 million by 2019. ...with A list squeal of approval . Walking adverts: Rosamund Pike, Colleen Rooney and Gwyneth Paltrow wearing Victoria Beckham's designs . Part of Victoria’s success is down to the array of A-listers seen in her designs. Stars such as Gwyneth Paltrow, Michelle Dockery, Amanda Holden, Coleen Rooney and Rosamund Pike have all chosen Victoria’s frocks for red-carpet appearances, while Victoria herself has become a walking advert for her brand. Property: A suitably posh address . Des res: The Beckham's London four-storey mansion in Kensington, West London worth £30million . The power couple have sizeable property portfolio (£25 million is Victoria’s half share). They reportedly paid £30 million for their four-storey mansion in Kensington, West London. They also own a five-bedroom mansion in Beverly Hills and are thought to still own a beach hideaway on the island of Ko Samui, Thailand, and a winery in Napa, which David gave Victoria as a gift. ...and a swanky new HQ . Beckham central: The family are said to have bought a business base in Notting Hill, West London recently . The Beckhams are said to have just bought a grand townhouse in Notting Hill, West London, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. They plan to turn the mansion on Pembridge Square into headquarters large enough to house both Victoria’s fashion empire, currently based in Battersea, and David’s new ventures following his retirement from football. Branding: Sweet smells of success . David and Victoria Beckham in the advert for their Intimately Beckham night perfumes for men and women . Victoria's women's fragrance 'Intimately Beckham', which also comes in a men's fragrance . Beckham Brand Ltd, representing them both, pulls in a profit of more than £ 1million a year. Their most prominent joint product is their perfume. Since 2005, Victoria and David have produced a staggering 24 fragrances between them in a lucrative deal with perfume house Coty. Six were Victoria’s, 18 David’s. Now the couple have reduced the range to six lines: For men there’s Classic, The Essence, Instinct, and Homme, while Signature and Intimately come in both his and hers scents. Art: Well, she could do Hirst . Work of heart: The £600,000 Hirst piece commissioned by Victoria for daughter Harper's first birthday in 2012 . Victoria has developed a keen eye for modern art and has a half share in the the Beckhams’ estimated £30 million collection, including work by Damien Hirst, Tracey Emin, Banksy and the Chapman brothers. Many of the pieces have a love theme, and Victoria also commissioned Hirst to create Daddy’s Girl, a 7ft heart-shaped canvas adorned with butterflies for daughter Harper’s first birthday in 2012. It is said to be worth £600,000. Accessories & jewellery: 13 'engagement' rings, 100 bags . Mrs Beckham poses with her pink Hermes Birkin bag. She owns around 100 and they are worth £1.5million . Victoria certainly has a taste for the finer things in life. She is a devotee of the Hermes Birkin bag and owns around 100, including this one, above. The collection is thought to be worth a total £1.5 million, with one of the priciest – a gift from David – being a rare £80,000 ‘Silver Himalayan’ complete with a three-carat diamond on the lock. Victoria is also thought to own a rare Birkin bag in crocodile skin with gold metalwork. One of these set a record for the most expensive handbag when it sold at auction in 2011 for £129,865. Victoria also has a £3.8 million jewellery collection, including no fewer than 13 engagement-type rings. One, an enormous heart-shaped diamond, is thought to be worth at least £1 million. PS Lost your trousers, David? Victoria must be wearing them! David Beckham, pictured, has his own brand underwear line with fashion store H&M - but turnover is down . Since finishing his playing career, David has admitted feeling at a loose end. In contrast his wife has told friends she feels ‘fulfilled’ with her expanding empire. David is hardly skint and still has his H&M underwear deal and deals to endorse firms such as Adidas, Breitling and Sky Sports. But turnover is down and his earnings may soon be eclipsed by his wife’s.","Victoria Beckham, 40, was named Britain's top entrepreneur last week .

"Three beaches along coastal Vandenberg Air Force Base in California have been closed through the weekend following a nonfatal shark attack, authorities said Friday. The attack occurred about 4 pm Thursday, military officials said in a brief statement posted on Vandenberg's website. The attack happened Thursday about a quarter-mile north of Wall Beach, which will be closed along with Surf and Minuteman beaches until 4 pm Sunday. A bite from a great white shark killed a surfer at Surf Beach in October 2012, and a bodyboarder at the same beach died in October 2010 when an apparent great white nearly severed one of his legs. Scene: Three beaches that line the Vandenberg Air Force Base in Santa Barbara - Wall, Surf and Minuteman - will remain closed until 4pm Sunday following a shark attack near Wall Beach in 2012 . Closed: Surf Beach had only recently reopened after being closed for seven months . Tragedy: In 2012, Califonia bodyboarder Francisco Javier Solorio Jr, 39, was killed by a great white at Surf Beach. In 2010, Lucas Ransom, a 19-year-old student at the University of California, died when a shark nearly severed his leg as he bodyboarded at the same beach . Vandenberg's statement only described the latest attack as non-fatal. A base public information officer did not immediately respond to a message seeking additional details. Vandenberg is a missile and space-launch site in Santa Barbara County about 130 miles northwest of Los Angeles. Surf Beach, which had been closed for several months during the Western Snowy Plover's nesting season, only reopened earlier this week. All three beaches provide nesting habitat for the endangered bird.","Victim suffered minor injuries during the attack on Thursday, about a quarter-mile north of Wall Beach .

"A jeweller with a childhood dream of seeing diamonds floating in the sky has fulfilled his wish after flying a £1million stone above London. Denis Bellessort, founder of Bonds of Union, was inspired after spending hours gazing at stars as a boy. To celebrate his company's fifth anniversary, the 53-year-old attached the gem to a remote-controlled hexacopter - a six-bladed mini helicopter - to fly above Holland Park in west London. The diamond let off a stunning beam of white light while being lit up as it flew above trees in Holland Park, west London on October 3 to celebrate Bonds of Union's fifth anniversary . Attached to the expert-controlled hexacopter, the £1million stone was lit up by a fixed light rig which showcased its beauty. Mr Bellessort said he had the idea from staring at stars as a child . The 10-carat £1million diamond is among the exquisite jewels sold by Bond of Union in London. It was chosen for the flight as it reflected the best light . The 10-carat diamond was lit up by a fixed rig on the device, sending piercing beams of white light across the night sky. 'The idea with the flying of a diamond was first for me a child dream while gazing at the stars and reminded with stories like the Little Prince and songs like Lucy in the sky with diamonds,' he said. 'Now it is a great reason to deepen my understanding on how light affects diamonds at long distance and how I could play with lights and diamonds.' The jeweller now hopes to put on similar displays from the Eiffel Tower, over snow and at the in the desert to showcase the beauty of diamonds. 'My theory was confirmed and the experience reveals the immense power of diamonds, a power that has never been seen before. 'The quality of the light when filtered through a diamond and returned to people at floor level creates the finest light that any medium can create. 'For me, the light with its pure white and colour flashes represent the highest level of beauty. It gives me the same joy as art but amplified. The 53-year-old said the stunt helped him understand the stone's capabilities with reflecting light. He is pictured launching the diamond into the sky on October 3 . The brightness of the diamond is clearly visible as it lines up next to the moon. Mr Bellessort said he would now like to try the stunt at the Eiffel Tower and over snow . 'I have spent a few months studying and practising the most appropriate angles to get the light fully inside the diamond with a right balance of few reflections. 'For the first flight I wanted to show the inner beauty of diamonds. 'Once I had an effect similar to the northern lights in green colour and then in blue colour as I was walking towards the centre of the diamonds, far below. This is something I will also recreate later. 'It is like walking in the sparks and brilliance of a diamond.'","Denis Bellessort of Bonds of Union jewellers in London chose a 10-carat white diamond to fly .

"A prison guard is accused of hiding bags of weed inside hollowed out sandwiches and trying to smuggle them into prison. Jason Marek, 29,  a correctional officer who went by the nickname 'Murder', worked at Chicago's Cook County Jail. He was stopped by jail personnel as he reported to work in June 2013 carrying a plastic shopping bag. Inside the bag authorities found two Jim Shoe sandwiches that had been crammed with bags of marijuana, as well as a carton of menthol cigarettes, according to the charges. Jason Marek, 29, a correctional officer Chicago's Cook County Jail (pictured) is accused of hiding bags of weed inside hollowed out sandwiches and smuggling them into prison . He was allegedly carrying 'Jim Shoe' sandwiches -a classic Chicago sub stuffed with corned beef, Italian beef and gyro meat - but hollowed out so that baggies of marijuana could be hidden inside, reports MyFox Chicago. It was reported there were 18 bags of weed in one sandwich . The corrections officer was arrested on Tuesday and faces a federal criminal charge, federal authorities said. Three inmates, two civilian women and a police dispatcher have also been charged by the U.S. Department of Justice in the case. In June 2013, the inmates and their two women friends allegedly bribed Marek to smuggle three ounces of pot, along with tobacco, alcohol and other contraband, into the jail, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern District of Illinois said in a statement. He was allegedly carrying 'Jim Shoe' sandwiches (example pictured) — a classic Chicago sub stuffed with corned beef, Italian beef and gyro meat — hollowed out so that baggies of marijuana could be hidden inside (file photo) He took a $200 bribe to make the delivery, it's alleged. Marek packed the marijuana inside two sandwiches and the inmates planned to sell it inside the jail, where it can fetch up to five times its street price, the statement said. According to the FBI, Marek attempted to deliver the marijuana to three inmates but was intercepted by the FBI and the Sheriff's Department's Office of Professional Responsibility as he entered the jail. Marek was arrested on Tuesday and released on his own recognizance. The two women and the police dispatcher were also charged and released. The three inmates who face charges remain in state custody, the statement said. The police dispatcher was charged with one count of illegally accessing a law-enforcement computer. The other six were charged with conspiracy to possess with intent to distribute marijuana. The defendants face maximum penalties of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, the U.S. Attorney's statement said.","Jason Marek, 29, a correctional officer,went by the nickname 'Murder'

"Spoken out: Bristol Palin, 24, (pictured last year) has said on a blog post that accusations she punched someone in the face during the drunken family brawl are lies . Bristol Palin has finally spoken out about the drunken brawl that broke out between members of her family and friends at a birthday party. The 24-year-old explained her side of the fight the day after an expletive-ridden audio tape of her police interview following the scrap in Anchorage, Alaska, was released. Many of the clips, some released by police, involve people accusing Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter of striking someone during the incident on September 6. The former Dancing In The Stars contestant condemned the 'lies' that she had punched someone in the face, saying that her 'perfect manicure to all ten of her nails' was intact afterwards. Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter then began to describe how the debacle unfolded, saying it began when a family friend was hit by a 'cheap shot'. Writing on her blog on Wednesday night, she said: 'Why would anyone do this? Well, here's a hint. The guy was on social media during this incident, tweeting, 'about to get famous.' 'Most of the time, I let the lies pass. After all, the truth eventually comes out. But when people are selling 'scoop,' photos, and false information… sometimes the truth just isn't as profitable. After the first punch was thrown, according to Bristol, Willow, 20, said to the man's mom: 'Get a hold of your son.' But the other women allegedly pushed. 'A grown woman pushed my little sister', she said. 'After this incident, I still had a perfect manicure on all ten of my nails. 'Plus – I'm left handed. I wouldn't even begin to know how to begin 'swinging' at someone,' she wrote. The post continued: 'Next to God, family is the most important thing to me. In fact, that day, we'd had a surprise party for my dad. We all secretly gathered in garage and yelled ""surprise!"" when he walked in. The real surprise was that we'd gotten him a truck too. 'But the evening that began so well took a turn for the worse when this guy decided he wanted to 'get famous'. Before finishing her post Bristol criticized the 'liberal media'  pointing out that Vice President Joe Biden's son was kicked out of the Navy after testing positive for cocaine and that Chelsea Clinton's father-in-law, Ed Mezvinsky, is a convicted felon. She said they are being relatively ignored: 'Because the friends and family of the revered liberal elite are treated like delicate China Don't handle too roughly. They are precious. They are off limits. Don't push on them too hard. Scroll down for video . Aftermath: Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter was pictured after the incident in Anchorage, Alaska, with dirt all over her jacket, claiming she was dragged along the ground . Her own evidence: She also says her 'perfect manicure' on each of her ten nails in the aftermath is proof that she did not hit someone, even though reports from others have suggested she did . Revelation: The post, the first time she has spoken about the incident, said: 'Most of the time, I let the lies pass. After all, the truth eventually comes out' 'In the meantime, I was pushed and held down by some guy… and the media salivates like a dog that’s just been given a bone.' On the audio that has been released by police, Bristol can be heard saying that the host of the party, Korey Klingenmeyer, 'came out of nowhere and pushes me on the ground… takes me by my feet, in my dress… my thong dress in front of everybody. Come on you c**t, get the f**k outta here! Come on you s**t get the f**k outta here. Bristol said the incident occurred after she went to confront a woman who called her sister Willow a 'sl*t.' She can also be heard crying and getting short with the police, saying at one point, 'I have a 5-year-old in the car, so if you're going to question me, question me.' She then gets upset saying that someone took her '$300 sunglasses and her fuc*ing shoes,' and asks that photos of her not show her face, saying 'there's nothing on my face except for beer and makeup.' Reaction: The post written by Sarah Palin's second eldest daughter on Wednesday continued: 'Next to God, family is the most important thing to me. In fact, that day, we'd had a surprise party for my dad . Witnesses to the booze-soaked brawl involving nearly every member of Sarah's family told police that Bristol, 23, was 'out of control' and accused her of striking Klingenmeyer repeatedly before he pushed her to the ground in defense, sparking the 20-person fight. Willow says on the audio that her sister never punched the host in the face, eloquently telling an officer on the scene, 'She missed every f*cking time!' New photos show the aftermath of a brawl involving almost every member of the Palin family that happened in Anchorage, Alaska, in September. It includes photos of Bristol covered in dirt and pictures of her red nail-varnished hands in the aftermath. Police have also released audio of the Palin family giving a statement which features a very angry and frustrated Bristol, Willow and Sarah Palin. The police report which dates from the night of father Todd Palin's 50th birthday celebration on September 6, lists Bristol as a suspect, her brother Track, 26, as a victim and Sarah and her husband as witnesses. Family fun: Todd Palin, 50, with son Trig, six, Sarah, 50, Bristol, 23, with her son Tripp, six, Willow, 20 and Track, 26, with his daughter Kyla Grace, three . Birthday celebrations: Bristol's post continues by saying that the main reason the family were together was to surprise their father by giving him a truck . It also lists Willow, 20, as a 'person interviewed.' The Palins had been celebrating Todd's birthday in their home town of Wasilla and had decided to go to their friend Klingenmeyer's house afterwards as he was also having a party. Klingenmeyer, who has decided not to press charges in connection with the alcohol-inspired melee, claims that a fight started out front of his house and that Bristol came out the back where he was and began punching him repeatedly after crossed words. When he stopped her punching him again, pushing her to the floor - her brother and father ran over and began fighting, sparking a brawl involving at least four men.","The 24-year-old wrote on blog day after expletive-ridden tape was released .

"Midwives in England have voted to join other NHS staff in a four-hour strike - the first walkout by health workers in 32 years. Unions are in dispute over the Government's refusal to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS workers. Members of the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) voted in favour of the walkout on October 13. It is the first time the union has balloted for industrial action and will be the first walk out by members in their 133-year history. Midwives and maternity support workers of the Royal College of Midwives have voted in favour of strike action. Chief executive Cathy Warwick, pictured, said: 'It could not send a clearer signal about the level of discontent on this issue to those denying them a very modest one per cent pay increase' An industrial action ballot saw 82 per cent of members vote in favour of strike action, and 94 per cent opting for action short of a strike. It comes as Unison, which represents 300,000 NHS staff in England, announced last week their members have voted in favour of action. Several other unions are balloting  health staff - including midwives - for industrial action, with more expected to join in on October 13 from 7am to 11am. It is thought up to 500,000 NHS staff represented by nine unions could take part in the planned walk out. Cathy Warwick, chief executive of the RCM, said: 'This is a resounding yes from our members. 'It could not send a clearer signal about the level of discontent on this issue to those denying them a very modest one per cent pay increase. 'Our members have suffered three years of pay restraint and face the prospect that their pay in 2016 will only be one per cent higher than it was in 2010. Members have voted to walkout on October 13, followed by four days of industrial action. Union bosses have called on the health secretary Jeremy Hunt to accept a recommended one per cent pay rise for NHS staff . 'The recommendations from all public sector pay review bodies have been followed except those for health workers. This is not acceptable. 'There is still time to come back to the negotiating table and to take a more reasonable position on the PRB recommendation. 'The RCM will be meeting with employers to discuss our action and to ensure that mothers and babies are not put at any risk. 'I want to reassure women expecting a baby that midwives will continue to look after them and that they will be safe.' The RCM reassured women expecting a baby that midwives will continue to care for them and they will be safe . The Department of Health said they are 'disappointed' RCM has rejected proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent extra pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year. A spokesman said they are keen to speak with union representatives to work to make the NHS pay system 'fairer and more affordable'. Last week Unison general secretary Dave Prentis said: 'NHS members don't take action often or lightly. 'For many of our members, this will be the first time they walk out as the last action over pay was 32 years ago. 'The NHS runs on the goodwill of its workers, but this Government has shown utter contempt for them. 'We are working with NHS employers to minimise the impact on patients. 'But it's not too late for Jeremy Hunt  to act to avoid this and we repeat our offer to the Government to negotiate with us, despite him refusing to meet with health unions about pay.' The action will lead up to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) demonstrations in London and Glasgow on October 18. The Department of Health spokesman said: 'We are disappointed that RCM is planning industrial action and has rejected our proposals to give NHS staff at least one per cent additional pay this year and at least a further one per cent next year. 'NHS staff are our greatest asset, and we've increased the NHS budget to pay for thousands more clinical staff since 2010, including more than 1,700 more midwives since May 2010. 'We want to protect these increases and cannot afford a pay rise on top of increments - which disproportionately reward the highest earners - without risking frontline jobs. 'We remain keen to meet with the unions to discuss how we can work together to make the NHS pay system fairer.' Gill Bellord, director of employment relations and reward at the NHS employers organisation, said: 'It is regrettable that members of the RCM have agreed to take industrial action along with some of the other NHS trades unions. 'Employers will be concerned that this industrial action could worry pregnant women.

"It is meant to be the happiest day of a woman's life. But looking at Amy Guy's sour expression in wedding photos, you'd be forgiven for thinking the opposite. However rather than being miserable, the 34-year-old simply cannot smile - due to a rare, potentially deadly condition that destroys muscles. The mother-of-two suffers from a rare autoimmune condition called myasthenia gravis, which causes certain muscles - including those that control facial expressions - to become weak. Amy Guy suffers from a rare condition that means she struggles to smile - and  makes her look miserable . The condition means Ms Guy often thinks she is smiling - even when her face is pulled into a pained grimace . The condition means  Ms Guy often thinks she is smiling - even when her face is pulled into a pained grimace. Photos on both her wedding day and the day her daughter was born show her looking pained and miserable - even though she was anything but. 'Fortunately [despite my condition] my daughter Megan was born healthy,' said Ms Guy, an activities manager. 'It was one of the happiest days of my life, but in the pictures I look so miserable.' Ms Guy, from Totton, Southampton, was just 14 when she lost her ability to smile. For weeks before, she had been suffering from slurred speech and aching joints. Then one day, as a friend tickled her, she caught sight of her reflection in a mirror. Despite laughing heartily, her face was pulling an ugly, pained grimace, baring her teeth. 'I was really scared and began to cry,' she recalled. Doctors initially put her intermittent symptoms down to 'growing pains' but as the months passed, they became more frequent and debilitating. She said: 'One of my eyes started to droop occasionally and people in the street would ask if I was drunk. The mother-of-two suffers from a rare autoimmune condition called myasthenia gravis, which causes certain muscles - including those that control facial expression - to become weak . Ms Guy, from Southampton, was just 14 when she lost her ability to smile and her condition is incurable . 'I was just a schoolgirl and so embarrassed.' Then a few weeks later, at her Saturday job, she suddenly collapsed and was referred to hospital. It was there that she and her mother met a doctor who, by chance, had recently been on a course and heard of a rare condition called myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is a rare long-term condition. It mainly affects muscles that are controlled voluntarily – often those controlling eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing and talking. Sometimes, the muscles that control breathing, neck and limb movements are also affected. The muscle weakness associated with myasthenia gravis is usually worse during physical activity and improves with rest. Tests confirmed Ms Guy had the life-threatening condition, for which there is no cure. 'At last I had a diagnosis, but it was difficult to take in how it was going to affect my life,' she said. 'Three months later, I was too ill to go to school anymore. Five months after my diagnosis, I was in a wheelchair.' Myasthenia gravis is caused by the body's immune system attacking healthy cells. Antibodies then block and damage muscle receptor cells affecting the body's ability to control nerves and muscles. Those most affected are muscles that are controlled voluntarily – often those controlling eye and eyelid movement, facial expression, chewing, swallowing and talking. Due to the intermittent nature of the condition, there were days when Ms Guy could walk and smile, and others she could barely get out of bed. The mother-of-two said: 'Even if my face can't express it, my girls know I'm smiling on the inside' 'The medication didn't work very well at first,' she said. 'I had an operation and that helped a bit but sometimes I couldn't smile, my eyes drooped and I couldn't even use my arms and legs very well.' Despite being warned she might not have the strength to get through pregnancy, she longed for a family of her own and was overjoyed to discover she was expecting in her early 20's, before marrying at 23. But after her marriage broke down, she is now raising her daughters,  Megan, 14, and Teagan, four, alone. She said: 'They help around the house wherever possible and know that sometimes mum gets wobbly or can only smile with her words. 'We have a special way of communicating.' Ms Guy has fought hard over the last 20 years to raise the profile of the MG Association. She is now writing her autobiography and has already raised more than £2,500 for research into the condition. She said: 'I've always wanted to show my girls that, even with a disability, you can still achieve your goals. 'No-one can tell me exactly what will happen in the future, but I live for the moment.' 'Even if my face can't express it, my girls know I'm smiling on the inside.' For more information, visit her blog.","Amy Guy, 34, has myasthenia gravis, a rare, life-threatening condition .

"Trading blows and brawling in the grass, two brown bear cubs go paw-to-paw in a play fight - leaving their other sibling to play the role of referee.

"When a passenger arrives into London and promptly enquirers whether most people in England speak English, there requires a certain level of diplomacy (and a straight face) from whoever is answering the question. But this is the kind of head-scratching enquiry that employees at Heathrow   regularly face. As the airport unveils its next generation of passenger service, Heathrow Helpers, it has revealed the top ten most bizarre queries and requests from visitors. 'Where can I exchange currency for some Scottish dollars?' Heathrow airport has revealed the top ten strangest questions from passengers . The list includes requests ranging from wanting to try on the Crown Jewels to bungee jumping off of the Heathrow control tower. Some of the genuine questions from befuddled passengers must have Helpers biting their tongue, from 'where can I exchange currency for Scottish dollars?' to 'What's the difference between a toilet and a loo?' Other passengers have asked for Heathrow employees to mark every single ATM in central London on their map for them. Given this number is in the thousands, they might be there for a while. 1. Can I bungee jump from your control tower? 2. I am heading to Tower Hill; can I try the Crown Jewels on there? 3. What's the difference between a toilet and a loo? 4. Are there ATMs in central London? Can you mark them on my map? 5. Where can I exchange currency for some Scottish dollars? 6. Will most people speak English during my holiday in London? 7. Where can I see James Bond's house? 8. Will I be able to see Beefeaters in the street? 9. Can I drink the water here? 10. Do I need to change the time on my watch or will it change automatically when I fly?

"New pictures show the effects dredging and dumping has on Australia's  Great Barrier Reef Heritage Area, after a ship was photographed dredging in Cairns' waters, north-Queensland. Dredging removes sediments from the bottom of harbours, lakes and rivers. It is also used to avoid the spread of contamination that could pose as a risk to fish, wildlife and people. Lissa Schindler from the Australian Marine Conservation Society (AMCS) said these images reveal the impact dredging has on our waters, which is a problem that extends across the whole Great Barrier Reef Coastline. 'There are proposals for millions of cubic metres of dredging from new projects that could be dumped in Reef waters,' Ms Schindler said. She said the act of dredging needs to be maintained, therefore once it starts it can never stop. 'The current proposal to build a new cruise ship terminal in Cairns would involve 4.4 million cubic metres of capital dredging to establish a larger shipping channel, which would require a significant amount of maintenance dredging every year after that,' she said. Ms Schindler insists this type of activity destroys the environment and will eventually affect  tourism and the fishing industry. 'It’s vital we protect the 63,000 jobs and $6 billion the Reef brings to the QLD economy by creating a sustainable approach to the environment, jobs and the economy.' Ms Schindler pointed to the beauty of these areas like the Great Barrier Reef and said they were too 'precious' to be used as a dumping ground for rocks and muds.

"For nearly three decades the Berlin Wall divided a city, splitting the communist east from the western capitalist enclave deep inside East Germany. Built by the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, in 1961, the wall cut off West Berlin from the east, and stopped East Germans leaving for the Federal Republic of Germany, or West Germany, and other European countries. Now, almost 25 years to the day since the wall fell on November 9, 1989, the German capital's appearance has changed dramatically, with the widely-hated structure replaced by modern buildings and bustling streets. East Germany disappeared less than a year later when the country was reunited, and although a few sections of the wall remain at their original sites, as does the famous 'Checkpoint Charlie', most of it was quickly pulled down with demolition carried out between the summer of 1990 and 1992. A quarter of a century on, the city is almost unrecognisable, as this gallery comparing images of the Berlin Wall when it stood with the same locations in the reunified German capital today shows. Scroll down for video . Changes: People started to pull down the Berlin Wall all after the East German Government allowed people to visit the West of the city on November 9, 1989. The top picture shows people dancing on the wall at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin the day after the ruling, while the bottom image shows how the landmark looks 25 years on . Bustling: The Berlin Wall was built by East Germany in 1961, and the top image shows the wall around the Brandenburg Gate on Nov 19, 1961. Today the same area is filled with cars, buses and people moving freely around the German capital . Taste of freedom: East Berlin citizens push through the newly-created passage at Bernauer Strasse, where East German border police tore down segments of the wall on November 11, 1989. Almost 25 years later people walk over the crossing at Bernauer Strasse and Oderberger Strasse . Transformation: In August 1962 (top) the Potsdamer Platz was empty with the Wall cutting it in two. Today it is a busy public square and traffic intersection, visited by up to 100,000 people a day. On July 21, 1990, the Platz played host to a charity concert organised by Pink Floyd's Roger Waters to commemorate the end of the division between East and West Germany . Attraction: Checkpoint Charlie was the best-known crossing point along the Berlin Wall, and is seen here being visited by U.S. President John F Kennedy, seen walking past a cordon of saluting servicemen and the sentry post on June 26, 1963. Today, the rebuilt checkpoint is a tourist attraction, manned by actors wearing replica uniforms . Presidential visit: President Kennedy looks out across the Berlin Wall into East Germany during his visit on June 26, 1963. Now tourists can visit this attraction to get something of a sense of what living with the wall was like . Construction work at the Berlin Wall on Aug. 13, 1985 on Friedrichstrasse near checkpoint Charlie and  Friedrichstrasse Oct. 2, 2014 - 25 years after the fall of the wall. (AP Photo/Markus Schreiber) Building work:  The top image shows East German workers and troops building the wall in front of the historic Reichstag building on November 20, 1961. After German reunification in 1990, the building - which had fallen into disuse - was the subject of a major renovation by Sir Norman Foster and now houses the German parliament . Peeking over: A child looks out onto the other side of the Wall as she climbs a pile of sand at a playground in July 1981. Cars now park at the  same spot in Berlin's Kreuzberg district . Transport: On March 12, 1971, anyone wanting to cross the Berlin Wall had to pass through checkpoints, such as this one at Heinrich-Heine-Strasse, while today people are free to cycle, drive and walk through the area, which has completely transformed . Similarities: A few of the buildings visible in this photograph of U.S. President Richard Nixon looking across the communist wall into East Germany during his stay in the divided city on February 27, 1969 are still visible today, while others in the area surrounding Checkpoint  Heinrich-Heine-Strasse have been replaced with more modern versions . A river runs through it: A woman looks out across the Spree river at the Berlin Wall in 1980, with construction work taking place at the Charite hospital in background. Today a bridge links the two sides of the river, which has a number of modern buildings along its banks . Memorial: The words 'The wall must fall' has been scrawled across the Berlin Wall along Bernauer Strasse in the north of Berlin when the top picture was taken on March 8, 1973. Now a memorial marker, made out of metal rods stands at the same spot, where on the night of November 10, 1989, the first segments of the Wall were knocked down  to create a new crossing between East and West Berlin . Changing places: The buildings seen in this picture of East Berlin, taken from an observation platform in Bernauer Strasse in the West in 1980 still remain, although they have been painted. Trams now run along the site where the wall once stood . Cut off: A group of children play alongside the barbed wire-topped Berlin Wall at Sebastianstrasse near Heinrich-Heine-Strasse in 1968, where today a man walks over the once-divided street . Building work: East German policemen in work dress remove barbed wire from a brick wall while other officers in the background are raising the wall to 15 feet at the border between the French and Russian sector at Bernauer Strasse in Berlin on September 9, 1961. The line where the wall once stood can be seen in the pavement today . So near and yet so far: West Berliners wave to their relatives in East Berlin one year after the Berlin Wall was erected at Bernauer Strasse on August 13, 1962, where today people cross the busy street freely .","Berlin Wall was built by the German Democratic Republic, or East Germany, in 1961 .

"David Cameron's battle with Brussels  proves it is impossible to control immigration from the EU, France's far right leader Marine Le Pen has claimed. The National Front MEP, who is standing for President in 2017, held up Mr Cameron as an 'example' of how European freedom of movement rules were sacrosanct in Brussels. Ms Le Pen wrote on Twitter: ‘We are not free to decide our immigration policy – as the example of Mr Cameron recently proved.’ Scroll down for video . National Front leader Marine Le Pen has dismissed David Cameron's efforts to reform migration - claiming it was an example that the EU was impossible to reform . The intervention comes after German Chancellor Angela Merkel reportedly told Mr Cameron that she would rather see Britain leave the EU than rip up freedom of movement rules. Mrs Merkel warned the Prime Minister that he was reaching a ‘point of no return’ by pushing for reform of the bloc’s sacred free movement system. The threat has forced Mr Cameron to tone down his ambitions for any deal to curb EU immigration. Mr Cameron has reportedly ditched a plan to impose a cap on the number of migrants allowed into Britain from the EU. Ministers will instead focus on making the existing rules work better for Britain. A source said Mr Cameron’s plans – to be outlined before Christmas – would stretch EU rules ‘to their limits’. She wrote: 'We are not free to decide our immigration policy – as the example of Mr Cameron recently proved’ German Chancellor Angela Merkel has blocked proposals to cap the number of EU migrants allowed into Britian . One proposal would ban EU migrants coming to Britain unless they had a job to go to. Anyone unable to support themselves would be deported after three months. It is thought the Prime Minister will seek Mrs Merkel’s approval before announcing any changes. Critics said Mrs Merkel’s warning demonstrated the weakness of Mr Cameron’s position. Eurosceptic Tory MP Jacob Rees-Mogg said: ‘It is looking increasingly unlikely that it will be possible to get a successful renegotiation.' Ukip leader Nigel Farage said: ‘The only logical next step is to abandon the renegotiation and announce an immediate referendum.’ It came after a close ally of the PM warned that he may “never be able to control” immigration from within the European Union and voters will have to accept that “a very large” number of foreigners will come to the UK every year. Nick Boles, a business and education minister, said that freedom of movement is a “fundamental principle” of the EU. Calais Mayor Natacha Bouchart was joined by Philippe Mignonet, Deputy Mayor of Calais (right) and Emmanuel Aguis, First Deputy to the Mayor (left) to give evidence to Parliament last week where . Campaigners fear that a new planned camp in Calais could quickly turn into a 'ghetto' for migrants . Meanwhile, it emerged today that British taxpayers will be contributing to a new £2.35 million a year welcome centre for UK-bound illegal migrants in Calais. The bill will be added to the £12million the British government has already pledged to the French to improve security in the port town this year. During a visit to Calais on Monday, French Interior Minister Bernard Cazeneuve signed an agreement to ensure the new facility will be open by January. But aid groups warned the centre could turn into an expensive 'ghetto' that will become a magnet for thousands more asylum seekers who want to make the journey across the English Channel. Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will have 'a budget of more than three million euros a year, which the state will be asking the European Union for.' Britain pays more than £8bn a year to the EU, meaning UK money will certainly end up being used to welcome the migrants to Calais, who currently number around 2,500. Mr Cazeneuve said the centre will be housed in a collection of prefabricated buildings close to the docks, where migrants try to get on lorries every day. Spain, Romania, Greece and Italy have seen the biggest increases in NINOs in the last six years, according to official government figures . The facility will serve at least 1,500 meals a day, and provide heating toilets and showers as well as beds for the most vulnerable. Thousands of migrants are camped in Calais waiting for their chance to make it to Britain. The French port’s mayor told MPs last week that Britain was seen as an ‘El Dorado’ for migrants – and many were prepared to die to make the journey. Blaming the UK for the crisis, Natacha Bouchart said lavish benefits and the prospect of illegal work and accommodation were magnets for immigrants determined to get across the English Channel. She said illegal migrants, many fleeing humanitarian disasters in Africa and the Middle East, were ‘prepared to die’ to reach Britain, believing it to be like the mythical lost city of gold, El Dorado. Giving evidence to the Commons home affairs select committee, she said: ‘The real magnet is not the city of Calais but the benefits that are perceived in Great Britain. ‘The weekly benefits of £36 that are given to migrants or asylum seekers is a huge amount for people who have nothing in their lives. ‘They have no idea about the value of money … But they know from those people who have got through [to Britain] that … they can easily find work, don’t have to declare their work, they can find accommodation and can get some money every week. People who have got through call and say, “ … this is El Dorado and we’re staying here”.’","PM's battles with Brussels held up as an 'example' by Marine Le Pen .

"James Jones may have accidentally hanged himself with his school bag while swinging from branches in woodland near his home in Salford, Greater Manchester . A boy of 15 may have accidentally hanged himself with his school bag while climbing trees. James Jones is feared to have become tangled in the cord of the bag as he clambered through branches in woodland near his home. The teenager was playing truant from school and a note suggesting he was feeling depressed was found in his pocket, an inquest heard. But the coroner said his family were convinced James did not intend to take his life. He recorded a verdict of misadventure and blamed the tragedy on ‘youthful exuberance’. James, of Clifton, Salford, was said to be an ‘exemplary student’ at Harper Green High School in Farnworth, Bolton, excelling in art and also pursuing hobbies including chess, sailing and scuba-diving. He could read and write Japanese. His family said he had a ‘heart of gold’ and was a hard-working, polite, conscientious boy. But he was also a fearless tree climber and loved nothing better than to play, high up in the branches, his sister Ashleigh, 21, said. Tragedy struck on April 28, on James’s first day back at school after the Easter holiday. He left to go to school as normal only to slip away to Clifton Marina and Country Park. His mother, Wendy, 43, a care co-ordinator, had no idea James had skipped classes until he was not home by 6pm. Thinking James would be at his friend’s house, she and her husband Barry, 43, were preparing to go there to check when a policeman knocked on the door to say their son’s body had been found by a dog walker. Schoolbooks were strewn around the surrounding area and a note was found in James’s pocket which said he was ‘fed up’ and wanted to leave all of his possessions to his younger brother. But Mrs Jones told the hearing in Bolton: ‘I don’t think he tried to take his life. ‘James had also written “don’t be sad”, but he scribbled that out. ‘I think he was trying to swing up in the tree and got caught. He would never see any danger. ‘He used to jump into the river and say, “It’s not very deep”.’ The schoolboy is thought to have accidentally hanged himself from a tree in Clifton Country Park, Salford . The tragedy struck in the park on April 28, James' first day back at school after the Easter holidays . Coroner Alan Walsh said: ‘He feared no danger. He would climb trees to hide from his friends and surprise people and do what might be considered to be reckless as a method of surprise or performing pranks. ‘It is likely that in the course of that activity he died without the intention to cause death. 'I think something horrible has gone wrong and there was nobody there to help him.' His father, a service engineer, wept as he said: ‘He was a very happy boy and we miss him so much.’ Andrew Foster, headmaster at Harper Green School in Farnworth, said: 'James had no problems at school. James was a model pupil, he was conscientious, and polite, a lovely boy. He didn't present any issues with his behaviour or pastoral needs. It comes as a complete shock.'","James Jones may have got tangled in the cord of his bag, inquest hears .

"Former Labour minister Alan Milburn said young people were being left behind in the recovery . The next generation will stay poorer than their parents throughout their lives unless 'urgent action' is taken to boost wages and slash youth unemployment, the Government's social mobility Tsar has claimed. Former Labour minster Alan Milburn said the recession had condemned those in their twenties to 'the wrong side of the divide' between those with good jobs and their own homes and those stranded on low pay. He revealed wages for the under 30s had fallen by 10 per cent since the recession pricing people out of buying their own home. Wages for those in their twenties are back to where they were in 1998 – 16 years ago. Half a millions young Britons were still out of work six years after the recession hit, Mr Milburn added. He said the jobs crisis had even put an end to the traditional Saturday job for students. The proportion of 16 to 17-year-olds in full-time education who also work has fallen from 37 per cent to 18 per cent in a decade. Mr Milburn told The Observer: 'It is depressing. The current generation of young people are educated better and for longer than any previous one. But young people are losing out on jobs, earnings and housing. 'This recession has been particularly hard on young people. The ratio of youth to adult unemployment rates was just over two to one in 1996, compared to just under three to one today. 'On any definition we are nowhere near the chancellor's objective of 'full employment' for young people. Young people are the losers in the recovery to date.' The average pay of a 22-to-29-year-old is now £9.73 an hour, 10 per cent lower than it was in 2006. Eighteen to 21-year-olds meanwhile are on just £6.73, is 8.8 per cent lower than six years ago. Both are at the same wage level as they were in 1998. The Institute for Fiscal Studies has revealed that those aged between 22 and 30 are now earning 15 per cent less than before the recession. The proportion of 18- to 24-year-olds in work has fallen from 65 per cent at the start of 2007 to 60.8 per cent today. Chancellor George Osborne is failing to achieve his goal of full youth employment, the Government's social mobility advisor Alan Milburn said . Despite recent falls in unemployment, the real value of people's stagnant wages are being eroded by inflation . The Government claims its 'long term economic plan' is starting to work - with more than half a millions people finding work last year . Mr Milburn said: 'Youth unemployment is still higher than before the recession and by the time of the next election around half a million young people will still be without work, enough to fill Wembley stadium five times over. 'Urgent action is needed to prevent this generation of young people faring worse than their parents' generation. 'Social mobility relies on young people having better opportunities to progress. Investment in the skills and employment of young people today is money saved in social security and the costs of poverty tomorrow.'","Alan Milburn says slump has condemned under 30s to 'wrong side of divide'

"Mitt Romney is still in the 'maybe' category for the 2016 presidential sweepstakes, judging from an interview published  Tuesday. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 also-ran said his thinking on a third try for the White House has boiled down to a line from the Jim Carrey movie 'Dumb and Dumber.' In the movie, Carrey's goofy character Lloyd Christmas is spurned by a love interest who says there's a one-in-a-million chance she would be with him. 'So,' he replies hopefully: 'You're telling me there's a chance?' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEOS . Will he or won't he? Mitt Romney doesn't seem to know yet, and is playing the speculation game as well as he can . Romney trounces the Republcian field in early Iowa polling, but will he follow through? Romney is playing along with the media's relentless will-he-or-won't-he curiosity – he told radio host Hugh Hewitt last month that he's not planning to run but 'circumstances can change' – but he's keeping his cards close to his vest. Officially, he's not running. 'I love the country enough to know that I'm not as good a candidate this time around as I think the other guys would be,' he told Hewitt. 'I want the country to win. I do not want to see Hillary Clinton as our next president.' But unofficially, he's staying in touch with his 2012 team of aides and consultants. Asked if he identified personally with the Jim Carrey quote, Romney would only tell The New York Times, 'I have nothing to add to the story.' But then came the latest non-denial-denial: 'We've got a lot of people looking at the race. We’ll see what happens.' Jennifer Rubin . Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin assembled a list of 15 reasons why Mitt Romney should sit out 2016 and remain the GOP's elder statesman, including: . The long-time pol's wife Ann said during a Fox News Channel interview on Sept. 23 that 'Mitt and I are not making plans.' But when host Neil Cavuto pointed out that Ronald Reagan only won the presidency after failing twice, she smiled. 'Well, we will see, won't we, Neil?' Mrs. Romney said. If former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush were to throw his hat into the ring, she suggested, it might preclude a Mitt three-fer since the two men would compete for the same centrist, non-tea-party base. But in a late August poll of likely Republican voters in Iowa, Bush came in a disappointing fifth place out of a field of 13 potential candidates, with barely 7 per cent support. Placing ahead of him were Mike Huckabee, Chris Christie, Rick Perry and 'undecided.' When Romney's name was added as a 14th option in the poll, he crushed the competition with more than 35 per cent. Bush shrank to below a 5 per cent showing – 7th place. As his poll numbers go up, Romney is attracting a dedicated cadre of true believers who are eager to capitalize on the buyer's remorse of disaffected Obama voters. More than 120,000 of them have clicked the approval of a 'Draft Mitt' petition, but that support may be soft: The draft committee's Twitter account has just 173 followers. And for every die-hard Mitt backer, there seems to be an equal and opposite detractor. The naysayers tend to have the biggest megaphones. Tanned, rested and ready: More than 120,000 Americans have signed an online petition encouraging the 2012 also-ran to take a third plunge into presidential politics . Jennifer Rubin, The left-leaning Washington Post's resident center-right columnist, opined Monday night that Romney should stay away from the 2016 race for the good of the Republican Party. Romney 'was right about a host of issues, most especially on foreign policy,' she wrote. 'His obvious prowess as an executive is badly needed in the White House.' 'I find it nearly impossible to believe he wouldn’t have been a better choice for the country than President Obama has been. But he should not run for president a third time.' What followed was a list of 15 reasons Romney should retire gracefully, or perhaps tee himself up as a potential Treasury Secretary appointee. Chief among them: 'In promoting an anti-elitism message, the GOP has the upper hand against Hillary – unless Romney runs.'","Romney told a New York Times reporter that his thinking mirrors a line from the movie 'Dumb and Dumber'

"Liam Lyburd, 18, arriving at North Tyneside Magistrates Court today where he is accused of planning a bomb attack targeting Newcastle College . A teenager accused of planning a pipe bomb attack was allegedly targeting a further education college, police have revealed. Around 50 homes had to be evacuated in Newcastle after police received reports from concerned neighbours and sent in a bomb disposal squad to Hamilton Place. Liam Lyburd, of Hamilton Place, has been charged with possessing a firearm with intent to endanger life, possessing ammunition with intent to endanger life. The teenager has also been charged with five counts of possessing an explosive substance, namely a pipe bomb, with intent to endanger life. Police claim there was 'intent to cause serious harm' at Newcastle College. Officers said they believe their actions prevented an incident taking place. After they received a report from neighbours at about 11.30am on Monday they searched a property. The neighbour had become concerned after seeing posts of Facebook. Police then evacuated the area and people were housed in Westgate Community College overnight. Further searches were carried out at the premises overnight and officers found officers found pipe bombs, firearms and three cannisters containing 94 lots of live ammunition as well as a black 'killbag' including black balaclava, knee and elbow pads, nail covered pipe bombs and a lanyard for holding a firearm. The items are now being forensically examined. Following completion of the searches, residents returned home on Tuesday morning. Newcastle College worked  with police throughout their investigation. Carole Kitching, principal of the college, said students should attend the college as usual and that officers would be patrolling the campus. She said: 'I would like to reassure staff, students and their families that their safety has been paramount to us and the college remains a safe place to study. 'Officers will be on patrol around the campus to offer reassurance and anyone who is concerned can speak to an officer or contact the college's welfare team.

"A worried mother captured the moment one of the huge cannibal spiders invading Britain gobbled up an insect in her home. Michelle Midwinter was shocked to discover a tube spider had taken up residence in her house in North Bradley, Wiltshire. In a bid to catch the arachnid, she attempted to draw it out of its hole using a daddy long legs as bait. Scroll down for video . A mother in Wiltshire discovered this huge tube spider lurking in her garage and tried to catch it using an insect . Michelle Midwinter (pictured, right) eventually captured one of the spiders (left), which she then released . But - as her video shows - the creature leapt back into its hole moments after grabbing the stricken insect. Tube spiders - one of the largest types of spider in the UK - are known for their green fangs and are said to eat their own mothers. As summer gives way to autumn and winter, sightings of the creatures inside people's homes have increased over the last month. Telling of her encounter with the spider, mother-of-one Ms Midwinter said: 'I thought the spider might pounce on anything moving - it looked pretty menacing. 'So to lure it out, I thought I'd feed it a crane fly near its nest to see what would happen. As you can see, the spider popped straight out, dragging the prey back into its nest. 'I must admit it was actually much bigger than I thought it would be - previous to this you could only really see its front legs and head as it sat at the entrance to its nest. 'After talking to my friend - who's a spider expert - I found out it is more than likely that there are more of them about. 'They tend to stay in their nest and you can only see them sitting at the entrance at night so I doubt a lot of people would even notice them if they were outside.' She says she was shocked by the size of the creature, which she could only initially see lurking in its hole . Ms Midwinter discovered the creature after an identical spider, which she believes is another on lurking in her home, landed on her shoulder as she walked into her garage with her two-year-old daughter. After eventually capturing it, she said: 'I considered trying to get the spider back in its nest, I thought I had better put it out at the end of the garden. 'I admit that after I released it I ran away in case it chased me because it looked pretty angry when it was trapped in the wine glass.' It is the latest sighting of one of the spiders in Britain, which are believed to have moved to Britain from southern Europe due to the warmer weather. Segestria florentina is the largest European spider found and the bodies of females can reach lengths of 22mm. Originally from the Mediterranean, they can be found as far east as Georgia but are also commonly spotted in Britain - particularly in the later half of the year. They have a black or dark brown body, often with a green shine on their fangs. While their bite has no long lasting effects, it is described as feeling similar to a bee sting or injection and the pain can last for several hours. They are also known as a tube web spider or cellar spider because they create a web in a crack or gap and wait for prey to step into it. Sightings of the spider in Britain have in the past been confused with the deadly Australian funnel web spider as the two species use a similar hunting technique.","Mother discovered one of spiders invading Britain was in her garage .

"Since forging a friendship in 2001, Vladimir Putin and Silvio Berlusconi have racked up thousands of miles  jetting off to catch up with each other in a host of international locations. The Russian president has attended parties at the Italian's infamous villa in Sardinia while Mr Putin reciprocated with holidays at his 20-bedroom dacha on the Black Sea. Last night it was Mr Berlusconi's turn to host again, with a very late-night dinner at his Milan apartment. Old friends: Berlusconi  waves goodbye to Putin as he leaves his Milan home. The former Italian prime minister had to persuade the judge to allow him to break the rules of his house arrest in order to meet his friend . Late-night meal:  Vladimir Putin, pictured with Berlusconi, was invited for dinner at the former Italian prime minister's Milan apartment. He was collected in a limousine at around 3.30am . Mr Putin, who was in Italy for an EU summit, arrived at the apartment of the former Italian prime minister at 1.40am, where they dined on white truffle pasta and tiramisu. The leader put in the early morning call to his long-term ally just hours after he met with David Cameron and President Poroshenko  to discuss ending the conflict in the Ukraine. His diplomatic blitz in Milan got off to a rocky start when he kept Angela Merkel waiting for a meeting and arrived late for a dinner with European and Asian leaders. Mr Berlusconi, who was convicted of tax evasion last year, had to persuade the judge to allow him to break the rules of his house arrest in order to meet his old friend, according to the Times. The scandal-mired politician, who brought his five children with him to meet the Russian leader, is usually required to be at his mansion outside Milan by 11pm. But he was allowed to host Mr Putin at his city residence. Mr Putin was collected from the apartment in a limousine at around 3.30am. Rocky start: The Russian leader, who met with David Cameron yesterday to discuss ending the conflict in Ukraine, was late for a meeting with Angela Merkel, pictured, during the Asia-EU summit yesterday . Outspoken support: The pair, pictured on a yacht in 2003, have been public in their support of each other's political approaches. Last night they dined on white truffle pasta and tiramisu . Just four hours later, Putin arrived for a meeting with President Poroshenko of Ukraine, attended by David Cameron, to discuss the conflict in the Ukraine. Last year, Mr Putin visited Berlusconi at his residence in Rome and was photographed throwing a ball for Dudu, the poodle belonging to Berlusconi's girlfriend. They have also attended extreme fighting events together and Mr Putin even has a bed named after him at the 77-year-old billionaire’s mansion. Light-hearted: Putin and Berlusconi were pictured wearing enormous Russian fur hats in 2003. Putin has also hosted Mr Berlusconi at his 20-bedroom dacha on the Black Sea . And their firm friendship has translated to outspoken political support for each other. In 2009, the US ambassador to Italy wrote in a leaked memo that Berlusconi admired 'Putin's macho, decisive and authoritarian governing style'. For his part, Mr Putin defended Berlusconi when he was tried for paying a minor for sex, claiming he that he would have had fewer problems if he had been gay.","Vladimir Putin was invited for late-night dinner at Berlusconi's apartment .

"A woman who was the sole survivor of a serial killer who claimed the lives of at least eight victims is suing Lifetime and parent company A&E Television after the network portrayed her as a prostitute in a recent made for TV movie. Daun Richert-Slagle, from Chico, California, was a 21-year-old mother of three back in 1990 when she was assaulted for several hours by Keith Hunter Jesperson, the man who would eventually become known as the Happy Face Killer. According to Slagle, it was only because she had her young son with her at the time that he eventually agreed to let her go. Scroll down for video .

Creative license: In the made for TV movie Happy Face Killer (above), Slagle is also portrayed as a woman who willingly had sex in front of her young child . Horrible memories: Keith Hunter Jesperson, also known as the Happy Face Killer, sexually assaulted Slagle for three hours, and only let her go because she had her young son (above) with her . Now, in the new Lifetime film Happy Face Killer, Slagle is being portrayed not just as a prostitute, but as a woman who willingly had sex with the serial killer in front of her own child. Slagle has responded by filing a lawsuit against Lifetime and A&E Television. 'Some of these things could literally destroy my career,' the registered nurse said in an interview with KTLA. 'In this particular case, Lifetime took somebody who had an innocent involvement with a serial killer and turned her, for whatever creative license or entertainment value, into a prostitute, into somebody trying to extort money, into being an unfit mother, which is completely deplorable,' added her attorney Tre Lovell. Captured: Jesperson (left) killed at least eight women over a five-year span, and is portrayed by David Arquette (right) in the Lifetime film . Young mother: Slagle was a 21-year-old mother of three (above) when the horrible assault occurred . Slagle claims that she and her husband had been arguing on April 13,1990, when she stormed out of the house and walked to a nearby shopping center with their youngest child. It was there she struck up a conversation with Jesperson, eventually getting into his car as it was cold outside. From there, he drove her to a nearby lake and sexually assaulted her for three hours in front of her son. Jesperson, who at that point had killed at least one woman, would go on to claim the lives of at least seven more victims over a five-year span. Captured : Jesperson (seen above as portrayed by Arquette) was eventually arrested and is currently serving three consecutive life sentences . He earned his nickname for the smiley faces he would draw on letters he sent to taunt the media and local prosecutors. He was eventually arrested by authorities on March 30, 1995 and is currently serving three consecutive life sentences. Lifetime and A&E have yet to issue a statement on the lawsuit, and are still airing the film, which stars David Arquette as Jesperson.","Daun Richert-Slagle is suing Lifetime and A&E Television after they portrayed her as a prostitute in the film Happy Face Killer .

"Think how much easier life would be if, in a crowded and noisy bar, you could tune in to what your friend is saying on the other side of a room and block out all other conversations. This is what one designer is suggesting might be possible in just a year or two – and it could come in especially handy for spies operating in crowded public places. Mark Rolston of Argodesign, California, thinks we will one day be able to wear devices that give us ‘superpowers’ such as ultra-directional hearing, incredible motor skills and anonymity when we want it. LaLaLa looks like a futuristic hearing aid. It is currently just a concept, but its creator thinks it could allow users to hone in on specific noises and conversations  in busy spaces, by simply pointing at the person you would like to listen to - and he thinks this could happen in just a couple of years . He came up with a concept called LaLaLa, which looks like a futuristic hearing aid. ‘LaLaLa would allow you to hear life as you intend it, though selective hearing, sound filtering, voice modification and more,’ Renae Alsobrook, operations manager at the firm told MailOnline. The design for the device takes inspiration from noise cancelling headphones, which block out background sounds. But unlike the headphones, LaLaLa could amplify wanted sounds too, such as a conversation, Fast Company reported. If the concept becomes a reality, the gadget would be able to track movement to zone in on a particular person. The ultimate goal is for a wearer to point or nod in the direction of a person they would like to hone in on and amplify their what they are saying. The conceptual device (pictured) is designed to be the size of an ear bud and could contain an array of microphones for sound isolation. It would also incorporate a camera for object recognition and gesture control. Its creator thinks the device could one day replace smartphones and people would ear it constantly . The LaLaLa is currently just a concept but its inventors think it could become a reality in just two years. The gadget is designed to fit inside the ear and hook round over the tragus, curling behind the ear. It is intended to give people selective hearing so they can zone in on an interesting conversation in a noisy room, while cancelling out background noise so they can hear it clearly. It would do this by using an array of built-in microphones as well as a camera to track movement. LaLaLa's creators think it could replace the smartphone and that people would wear it constantly. Future iterations of the design could also allow people to translate other languages in real-time. ‘Utilising an advanced microphone array and motion sensing camera, LaLaLa allows you to point at a sound target in order to isolate and adjust the volume of everything else around you,’ Mr Alsobrook explained. ‘The device is as small as a Bluetooth earbud, and contains an array of microphones for sound isolation. It also provides object recognition and gesture control. 'Using a built-in camera, LaLaLa can take pictures, provide object recognition of things you look at and watch your hands for gestures which it interprets as commands.’ Mr Rolston believes such a device could replace smartphones and people would wear it all the time. It would contain all their contacts, could connect to a phone and allow a new hi-tech type of teleconferencing. ‘If this is the next-gen iPhone, the idea of spatially placing people could be phenomenal,’ he said. Mr Alsobrook added: ‘We expect that in the near future, many social media apps will break free from smartphones, and become their own form of wearables. ‘More than just umbrellas that tell you when rain is coming, these are the apps that reach deep into our digital lifestyles – and when they develop physical manifestations as wearables, their reach will extend into the real world and more deeply into your real life. He claims: ‘LaLaLa could completely redefine the human-aural experience. ‘With LaLaLa, you control what you hear; you can drown out the drone of your parents’ lecturing, translate a Spanish speaker as he’s talking to you, zero in on your friend at a loud party, or mute the loud talker seated nearby in a restaurant.’ ‘You’ll even have a recorded and transcribed history of everything you hear.’ He thinks this futuristic vision could become a reality in ‘a year or two’. LaLaLa could make it easier to eaves drop on conversations in public places, like a bar, and would be very useful for spies. Its inventors think it could replace smartphones and one day include a feature to translate a foreign language in real-time .","LaLaLa - a conceptual device - looks like a futuristic hearing aid .

"A Canadian National Railway Company freight train carrying flammable products derailed in central Saskatchewan Tuesday and became engulfed in flames, causing the evacuation of a nearby town. The Saskatchewan government said the accident happened near the small community of Clair. About 50 people were forced to leave their homes. Provincial officials said hazardous materials crews were en route. CN spokesman Jim Feeny said the fire is coming from petroleum distillate, which spilled from two of the derailed cars.

They spilled and that is the source of the fire,' Feeny said. Feeny said the crew is not injured. He said the train was made up of three locomotives pulling 100 cars and that 26 of them derailed Tuesday morning. Sixty of the cars were empty and forty were carrying goods including six carrying dangerous goods. Besides the two carrying petroleum distillate two were carrying hydrochloric acid and two were carrying caustic soda. The train originated in Winnipeg, Manitoba and was traveling to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. A witness told a local radio station that the flames are at least 100 feet high. Alison Squires, the publisher of the local Wadena News, visited the site of the derailment and told The Canadian Press that she has never seen anything like it. 'When I got there, there was a small explosion,' she recalled. 'The smoke is too thick to see what cars are involved.' Canada's Transportation Safety Board said it is deploying a team of investigators to the site. As of Tuesday evening, the petroleum fire has diminished but was still raging.

"A funeral home worker was arrested in Washington state after police said he pretended to be a retired officer for two decades and recently intervened in a fight. Authorities became aware of suspect Jim Bailey last month after he tried to break up a dispute between a couple in a car by identifying himself as a retired cop and telling a witness to call 911, Oak Harbor Police Chief Edgar Green said. Liar: Authorities became aware of suspect Jim Bailey last month after he tried to break up a dispute between a couple in a car by identifying himself as a retired cop and telling a witness to call 911 . An investigation determined the 69-year-old Bailey had been pretending to be a retired officer for more than 20 years, the chief said. Impersonating a police officer is a gross misdemeanor in Washington. 'We're very proud of what we do and work very hard at what we do,' Green said. 'So to find someone who comes along and just takes that for granted and pretends to be one of us, that's upsetting.' Green said Bailey gave himself away when he saw a couple fighting in their car at an intersection and stopped to help, telling them he was a 'retired cop.' He was also wearing a shirt that identified him as an Oak Harbor officer when he was arrested. Even longtime family friend Joan Waldron said she thought Bailey had been an officer. 'That's shocking to me because I thought he was somehow related to the police department,' she said of the arrest. 'He really seems to be from all accounts an outstanding citizen,' she added. At least two other neighbors said they thought Bailey had been connected to law enforcement. Bailey's attorney counters that Bailey never claimed to be a police officer, retired or otherwise. Bailey's attorney says the situation is a misunderstanding and Bailey, who was arrested last week, is a good Samaritan who tried to help, KOMO reported Tuesday. A message left Friday by The Associated Press for attorney Christon Skinner wasn't immediately returned. Bailey has refused to respond to interview requests. Bailey spent a few years as an Oak Harbor reserve officer in the late 1980s but did not graduate from the police academy or become an officer. Green believes the deception may have been going on since 1991. He may have even collected paychecks for providing training and lectures under the guise of being a former officer. 'It appears through our investigation this has been going on for a good 20 or 25 years or so,' Green told KOMO.","Jim Bailey was arrested after intervening in an argument and telling witnesses he was a former officer.

"Diana, Princess of Wales was as well known for philanthropy and kindness as she was for her unerring sense of style. And now, one of the late royal's favourite dressers has opened up about working with the style icon. Jacques Azagury was introduced to the princess by Anna Harvey, who was deputy editor of British Vogue and a style consultant to the royal. Scroll down for video . Style icon: One of Diana's favourite dressers, Jacques Azagury, whose dresses she can be seen wearing, left, on her 36th birthday and, right, on a trip to Venice, chatted to FEMAIL about all things fashion . They went on to develop a strong bond and became great friends, working together right up until her untimely death in 1997. 'My favourite memory of Princess Diana was her presence,' Jacques tells us. 'Another great memory was the sheer fun we had together, especially when it came to choosing her next look. 'Diana had such a modern look rather than being very formal.' Thanks to his expertise, Moroccan-born Azagury worked with Naomi Watts, who starred as Diana in the recent biopic. He created  dresses for the film and used the exact same material that he had left over from creating Diana's original pieces for some of the garments. 'Naomi was a delight to work with,' he said. 'From the moment she walked in, she just completely understood I was dressing her like Diana, we worked very fast together and it was such an easy and enjoyable job.' So would Jacques ever consider dressing the Duchess of Cambridge? 'Like any other designer, I would love to dress Kate,' he said. Azagury is famed for his red-carpet 'pret-a-couture' and currently dresses some of the most glamorous women in the world - everyone from rock stars to royalty, BAFTA winners to burlesque dancers. His current clients include Kelly Brook, Sheridan Smith, Elizabeth McGovern, and Naomi Watts to name just a few. So what's his secret formula? 'I just love making a woman look great. I would never send a women out on the red carpet looking like someone from the army or a Japanese soldier, she has to look glamorous and sexy. 'I love all of the women I dress, they are from all different backgrounds.' Royal team: Diana's butler Paul Burrell (left) with fashion designer Jacques Azagury . One of his clients, Dame Helen Mirren, has become a postergirl for mature style. 'My advice for looking that good is try not to look like your 15-year-old daughter. Dress age appropriate but not boring,' says the designer. And it isn't just in the design world that he's made waves; Azagury also has a fragrance range to boast, which he has just added six new scents to. The Azagury fragrances serve as an extension of his fashion range and aim to reflect the true design philosophy of the brand. Modern muses: Myleene Klass, left, and Kelly Brook love wearing Jacques's feminine designs to award shows and showbiz events . He has spent three years working on the range of fragrances and was inspired, in part, by his travels in France, Italy and Peru.

"Vladimir Putin blasted the West today over Ukraine after angering the German chancellor by turning up late for a summit in Milan with world leaders. Angela Merkel cancelled a session with the Kremlin strongman last night after Putin was delayed arriving at the talks, which include David Cameron. Putin had travelled from Belgrade where he was given a hero's welcome. German chancellor Angela Merkel initially cancelled talks with Vladimir Putin at a world leaders summit in Milan after the Russian president turned up late . Putin and Merkel at the 10th Asia-Europe Meeting; Putin made it clear there was little progress with Russia and the West sharply divided over solutions to the Ukraine crisis, which has cost more than 3,600 lives . A tense late night two and a half hour bilateral between Russian-speaking Merkel and German-speaking Putin was eventually rescheduled after a welcome dinner at the two-day ASEM summit of European and Asian leaders. Putin's spokesman made clear there was little progress with Russia and the West sharply divided over solutions to the Ukraine crisis, which has cost more than 3,600 lives in six months. Dmitry Peskov said: 'There are still serious differences concerning the origin of Ukraine's internal conflict, as well as the root causes of what is currently happening.' Mr Peskov said some Western leaders displayed 'incomprehension' over Ukraine and refused to accept 'reality'. He said: 'Unfortunately, some participants at breakfast demonstrated complete unwillingness to understand the reality in southeastern Ukraine. 'Indeed the talks are difficult, there are plenty of disagreements, plenty of incomprehension. Putin shakes hands with Ukraine's President Petro Poroshenko before the talks began . Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko speaks with Merkel and prime minister David Cameron . 'But at the same time they are going on, there is an exchange of opinion.' Merkel contends that Russia is holding back peace by failing in a promise to pull out its troops. A ceasefire agreement thrashed out last month in Minsk was 'first and foremost' Russia's responsibility to implement, she told the Russian leader. Putin was today meeting Ukrainian leader Petro Poroshenko over the crisis and said 'peace and stability in Ukraine, it is the only thing we expect'. Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov assured Czech leaders that Moscow had no intention of invading Ukraine, said Czech president Milos Zeman. It was the first time Cameron has met Putin since Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 was shot out of the skies above Ukraine, in an act the West blames on rebel fighters backed by Moscow. Putin was delayed after attending a military parade in Belgrade where he received a heroes welcome . Serbian onlookers wave the Russian flag as they cheer during the military parade . Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte admitted he had an 'emotional' confrontation with Putin over the tragedy. All 298 passengers on board were killed - 153 of them from the Netherlands. Rutte said: 'I have just spoken to President Putin in Milan and demanded maximum cooperation in resolving the MH17 disaster. 'It is an emotional subject and of course I am angry at all parties who have made it impossible to start work in at the crash site. 'But it's now up to us to reach our goal. I'll use every opportunity to highlight the issue.' A mass funeral was held in Ukraine yesterday for 21 unidentified soldiers killed during the conflict . On Monday four Dutch experts returned to the crash site in pro-Moscow rebel-held territory in eastern Ukraine, but Dutch officials, including Rutte, have lamented the lack of proper access to the wreck site. Dutch forensic experts called off their search of the area in early August because of the ongoing fighting between Kiev and pro-Russian separatists. The summit was also on edge over a Putin threat to cut gas supplies to the EU if energy-starved Ukraine is found to siphon off supplies from a pipeline transiting its territory. 'There are major transit risks,' Putin said ahead of the meeting. Meanwhile, a mass funeral was held in Dnepropetrovsk, Ukraine, yesterday for 21 unidentified soldiers killed during the conflict. After a brief service the deceased were taken out of town and buried in lines next to one another.","German chancellor Angela Merkel cancelled a meeting with Vladimir Putin .

"A schoolgirl who killed herself after she was sexually abused was let down by police who failed to investigate, her family said yesterday. Mary Stroman, 16, suffered years of mental torment over the abuse and told a friend she had been ‘raped and raped’ and had suffered several miscarriages. Her parents took her clothing, phone and computer to police, but said the inquiry was abandoned after the teenager refused to cooperate, saying the men who abused her would hurt her family if she spoke to the authorities. Scott and Sue Stroman (pictured) say that council 'failed' their daughter Mary after she was sexually abused . The coroner ruled that 16-year-old Mary took her own life after she was struck by a train in January of this year . Meanwhile her treatment for hallucinations, nightmares and flashbacks prompted by the abuse was disrupted by council funding delays, leaving her in ‘despair’, her family said. Mary threw herself in front of a train in January, two days after an inquest began into the suicide of former classmate Tallulah Wilson who killed herself the same way. Both attended St Marylebone School in Central London, where Mary was said to be a popular, straight-A pupil from an affluent family before the abuse started. Her family believe she was subjected to ‘a terrible sexual trauma’ starting when she was 12 or 13. She told them she had been assaulted in Finsbury Park, near their home in North London, and forced to have sex in a toilet in a shopping centre in Islington. She said she was ‘prostituted’ at a house where she was given vodka and where she eventually shot herself in the chest with a pellet gun. Her inquest heard she began binge drinking and tried cannabis, and self-harmed as a way of ‘coping’. Three psychiatrists said she was the victim of sexual abuse which had left her with post-traumatic stress disorder. The inquest heard Mary, pictured left and right, had a history of self-harming. At the time of her death, the teenager was living at a residential school for girls with emotional and behavioural difficulties . Mary, the youngest of five children, was admitted to The Priory three times and treated at a psychiatric unit. Her mother Sue Stroman, 59, and husband Scott, a jazz professor, said in a statement: ‘Mary would never reveal the details and without her cooperation the Metropolitan Police felt they could not pursue an investigation. ‘It was and is a cause of continuing frustration and sorrow to us that nothing could be done to try to identify the perpetrators both for Mary’s sake and for that of other children who could similarly be at risk.’ Mr Stroman said the Rotherham sex abuse involving 1,400 children had shown abusive men exploited police inertia to prey on vulnerable teenagers. Fighting back tears he said: ‘We have one daughter, to us she’s a huge part of our life. It seems incredible the number has to get up to 1,400.’ Mary Stroman, left, died after being hit by a train in January this year during the inquest of Tallulah Wilson, right. Tallulah, 15, killed herself at London's St Pancras station in October 2012 . The St Marylebone School, in London, which schoolgirls Tallulah Wilson and Mary Stroman both attended . She had to wait 13 months as Haringey Council – criticised over failures in the Baby P and Victoria Climbie deaths – approved funding for her to be admitted to Tumblewood care home in Wiltshire, the family said. They said: 'The continual delay seriously impacted her mental health, providing her with constant false hopes, repeated disappointments and a deterioration of trust - leading at times to despair. ‘In the meantime, Mary had suffered many further months of grief and mistrust, had been subjected to a further series of assessments and had been assigned a changing series of social workers, forcing her to “tell her story” over and over. She was tired and tormented and lost confidence in the fact there was a way forward for her. ‘Though we feel the individuals who dealt with Mary from Haringey social services were sympathetic and professional, we found the overall quality of service that we received was very seriously lacking. The workings of the machine and bureaucracy were insufficient.’ Recording a verdict of suicide, Wiltshire coroner David Ridley said he did not believe the police’s failure to investigate or the council delays had ‘directly contributed’ to her death. Haringey Council said Mary’s case was ‘complex and difficult’ and a serious case review had begun. The Metropolitan Police Service did not respond to requests for comment.

"Airbus has patented innovative technology to scare off fowl that gather in flocks near airports in an attempt to avoid costly and potentially devastating bird strikes. The proposed system would mimic bird noises and can be set up on the ground at an airport or its equipment can be fitted to front of an aircraft. It’s the latest example of the lengths that manufacturers, airlines and airports are reaching as bird strikes cost the world’s aviation industry nearly £1bn a year as a result of damage, delays for travellers or missed flight connections. The European Aviation Safety Agency says bird strikes cost the industry nearly £1bn a year . Patent: Airbus has patented a system that mimics the sounds of birds in an attempt to prevent bird strikes . Nearly 2,500 bird strikes were reported in the UK last year with an average of around six a day, according to the Civil Aviation Authority. A Federal Aviation Administration study suggests there are an average of nine bird strikes a day involving civil aircraft in the US alone. To repel birds, Airbus’ system mimics warning signals from birds of prey, natural distress calls from specific flocks, and the flapping of wings. The ‘acoustic scaring device’ would be located on a plane’s nose landing gear, according to a rough sketch submitted with the patent application. A study by a London consulting firm suggests each bird strike costs an average of £41,000 . Airbus patented the system as it expects a ‘considerable increase’ in the number of bird strikes due to a risk in air traffic in South America, Asia and Africa, and that potentially means more delays for passengers. But the manufacturer admits it may not have found the perfect solution because some bird species may become accustomed to the noise or it may have no effect at all. Last week, discount airline Fastjet announced that bird strikes had wreaked havoc on its operations. With four incidents in two weeks, the Gatwick-based airline had to delay or cancel flights because it had no replacement aircraft available. Miracle on the Hudson: There was no loss of life after a US Airways flight ditched into New York's Hudson River . Manufacturers, airlines and airports have been paying greater attention to the problem since arguably the most famous bird strike of all time. Known as the Miracle on the Hudson, a US Airways Airbus A320 was forced to ditch into the Hudson River in New York after hitting a flock of Canada geese on 29 January 2009. The incident was dubbed a ‘miracle’ because no one died. The largest loss of life resulting from a bird strike occurred in 1960, when an Eastern Air Lines flight struck a flock of European starlings during take-off. A sign at Manchester Airport warns people not to feed birds as a crow is perched behind the security fence . All four engines were damaged and the plane crashed in the Boston, Massachusetts, harbour, killing 62 people. Since 1912, there have been nearly 250 fatalities arising from bird strikes, according to the European Aviation Safety Agency. A study conducted by London consulting firm Insight SRI found that bird strikes occur 2.1 times per 10,000 aircraft movements, and roughly two-thirds cause no damage. The remainder cost roughly £41,000 per strike, according to the study.","System would mimic noises of predators and natural distress calls .

"A four-year-old autistic boy has lived out his dream of becoming a police officer, thanks to a San Diego police sergeant who organized for the little boy to take part in a motorcycle parade. Alexander Sanchez became Officer Xander for the day, when he rode into the Southern Division police substation  parking lot on his mini motorcycle. About 20 officers were out front to greet Xander and a handful of motorcycle cops followed him on their bikes, with lights flashing, in a police parade. Scroll down for video . Four-year-old Alexander Sanchez became Officer Xander for the day, when he rode into the Southern Division police substation parking lot on his mini motorcycle . The little boy's dreams were turned into a reality by Sergeant Lem Siansonoy, who met Xander when he was approached by him for a police sticker, UT San Diego reports. 'We were taking a walk and Xander saw (him) sitting in his car,' said the boy's aunt, Ana Villegas. 'He walked right up and knocked on the window and asked for a sticker.' The police sergeant didn't have any stickers on him, but he promised Xander he would stop by his home in the Otay Mesa West neighborhood in southern San Diego. Sergeant Siansonoy told the paper that he understood just how important these stickers could be to a boy like Xander. He was a young Cambodian refugee when his school, Sherman Elementary, was adopted by the San Diego Police Department. An officer gave him one of his stickers, and it made an impression on the young Siansonoy. 'I know it's just a paper sticker, but it was a symbolic thing for me,' he said. 'I wanted a real one and that's one of the reasons I'm a police officer today.' As promised, a couple of weeks later, the sergeant surprised Xander with an impromptu visit to the home with a bag of police-themed goodies including a ball, a key chain and stickers. Xander greeted the sergeant wearing his police Halloween costume, and he even had his miniature police motorcycle parked out front. 'Part of what makes him feel safe and secure is dressing up,' explained Ms Villegas, 25. 'He's dressed up as a firefighter and a soldier. He's been dressing as a police officer for almost two years.' Xander was diagnosed with autism aged 3, but he is much more positive after his day as a police officer . Sergeant Siansonoy the decided to invite the family to tour the Southern Division police substation, which is just a couple of blocks from Xander's home. Xander arrived in his little motorcycle to be grreted by officers on their own bikes who accompanied him on the mini parade. The little boy was also able to have his picture taken with the officers and the whole family was treated to a tour around the station. 'I don't think they realize just what they did for Xander and for us,' said Ms Villegas. 'This couldn't have come at a better time.' Xander was diagnosed with autism by the age of three and his aunt said that he has struggled to deal with the changes in his life. His uncle and his grandfather are the father figures, but his grandfather has been away for work and his uncle, who is in the Navy, was recently stationed on the East Coast. 'He's been moody from not having that male stability and his behavior has been really unpredictable,' his aunt said. Xander is cared for by his grandmother and Ms Villegas during the day, while his mother is at work. The positive change in Xander after the visit to the police station has been remarkable, his aunt said. 'This was so positive,' she added. 'They made him feel noticed, and most of all, important. That they would give so much after such a small request, it's really amazing.' The only down side, according to Ms Villegas, is that she and Xander's grandmother have been getting a lot of tickets since Xander visited the police station. 'They gave him a notepad to write tickets and he's been giving them to everyone,' she said. 'You're on grandma's driveway? You get a ticket.'","Alexander Sanchez was Officer Xander for the day riding his mini motorcycle .

"An engineer who was told by cyclists that they never wore a helmet because they were 'an inconvenience to carry' has come up with a solution - the folding helmet. Philippe Arrouart carried out his own study as to why urban cyclists and commuters felt the need to ditch helmets while cycling in cities. And his solution, the Plixi helmet, neatly folds away to a third of its size in small bags. Scroll down for video . A Paris-based inventor has designed a portable bike helmet (shown). Called Plixi the £60 ($95) product folds to a third of its size. It has a number of segments and hinges that let it be stored more easily. It also meets safety regulations and can be used by cyclists to BMX riders . The Plixi helmet, which costs about £79 ($126), was made by engineer Mr Arrouart, 40, from Paris, France. He began his study when he noticed increasing numbers of people were using the Velib bike sharing system in Paris - similar to the Boris Bikes in London. But he felt people were not sufficiently protecting themselves without a helmet. Volume is divided by 3 when folded. Size of the helmet when folded: 8.3 x 4.3 x 6.3 inches (21 x 11 x 16 cm). Weight: 490g (one pound). Outer shell is made of ABS plastic - inner shell is made of expanded polystyrene. The helmet has 14 vents. Sold with inner fitting pads of various thicknesses to adjust the comfort of the helmet . Adjustable straps with chin protection . 'Many people immediately used those bikes to commute when Velib came in,' he said. 'Drivers were not used to them and people started to say ""it is dangerous, we'll have many accidents"". 'I wondered why those people were not protecting themselves with a bike helmet. 'I asked urban cyclists why they didn't wear a helmet and the number one answer was the inconvenience of carrying your helmet with you when you're not on the bike. 'The other main reason was the look and style you have when wearing a bike helmet. 'So I got the idea to create a folding bike helmet which is much easier to carry and store while also being chic and trendy.' The helmet meets safety regulations and can be used by cyclists, BMX riders and other people on a bike. The product is available in black or white (shown) and will come in two sizes . The Plixi helmet, which costs about £79 ($126), was made by engineer Philippe Arrouart, 40, from Paris, France. He began his study when he noticed more and more people were starting to use the Velib bike sharing system in Paris - like Boris Bikes in London . He created the company Overade in December 2010 and began making prototypes, involving designers to improve its look and style. The result is a helmet which takes no longer than two or three seconds to stow away in a bag. It currently is available in one size, large/extra-large, which measures 23.2 to 24.4 inches (59 to 62 cm), although a smaller version is planned. The helmets are also open to customisation, with add-ons like covers and visors, and come in a range of colours. Plixi answers European certification on bike helmets, meaning that despite targeting commuters and urban cyclists, it can be used by road racers and BMX riders as well. Business partner Clement Cailleau, 31, added: 'People who have seen it really like the finishing quality of the product. 'They enjoy manipulating the Plixi and agree it is easy and simple to use. They realise in their everyday life that it truly brings a real value added.' The helmet takes no longer than two or three seconds to stow away in a bag.

"A new study has found that men who treat their sleep apnoea experience a better sex life. The study involved 61 men from Melbourne and Sydney who suffered from sleeping disorder and erectile difficulties and found that both conditions improved with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. Kerri Melehan, the leader of the study from Sydney's Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, told Daily Mail Australia that the treatment improved the 'overall sexual satisfaction' of the men involved as the two conditions often come hand in hand. The study involved 61 men from Melbourne and Sydney who suffered from both sleep apnoea and erectile difficulties . 'What normally happens during sleep is that men have erections during REM sleep around about every 90 minutes and when they wake up with erection that's because they woke up in the middle of REM,' Dr Melehan said. 'But, if you have sleep apnoea, that can interrupt your sleep and in particular it interrupts REM sleep and also the erections that's should be happening, so it doesn't get that practice overnight that's needed.' Dr Melehan said her study, which took place between 2010 and 2013, tested men who had never bene treated for sleep apnoea. Out of the 61 men, 30 received CPAP treatment and 31 received a placebo treatment. A different selection of 31 men were also given an erectile dysfunction drug while the remaining 30 received a placebo. 'Some guys got both, some got none and the rest got one,' Dr Melehan explained. 'Over the three months we asked them about their sexual activity and how their erections were going and we also measured their erections during their sleep and we found CPAP increased the number of those. 'We can report that if you are a man with sleep apnoea and erectile dysfunction you're better of being treated for sleep apnoea than using drugs to treat the erectile dysfunction, but for some men it doesn't necessarily work. Men receiving CPAP reported an improvement in their 'overall sexual satisfaction' and more erections during their sleep . The study's leader said men receiving CPAP reported an improvement in their 'overall sexual satisfaction' and more erections during their sleep . 'That's because there a lot of things that can be attributed to erectile dysfunction and for those guys, drugs do work. But even so, there are advantages in treating the sleep apnoea.' Dr Melehan said that she hopes the results of her study, which will be revealed at the 26th annual Australasian Sleep Conference in Perth this week, will encourage and motivate men to treat their sleeping disorders. The scientific conference will open at the Perth Convention Centre on Thursday, October 9 and wrap up on Saturday, October 11. Sleeping disorders and erectile difficulties can both be improved with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment.","The study involved 61 men from Melbourne and Sydney who suffered from both sleep apnoea and erectile difficulties .

"He might have been a bikie - but behind Randall 'Animal' Nelson's gruff beard and  leather exterior was a kind-hearted man who showered children in gifts and offered shelter to the homeless. Hundreds, including distinguished guests and close friends, filled Sydney's  Wayside Chapel on Saturday to mourn the decorated Kings Cross identity who was remembered as 'a bloke with a beard, a bike a banner and a big heart.' Rows of shiny motorcycles crowded entry points to the tiny  Kings Cross  church as well-wishers gathered by the side of their Harley-Davidson's before a path was cleared for colourful. Kings Cross Bikers revved their motors as the sound of loud engines, cheers and applause reverberated through the ears of all who attended. Everyone was encouraged to be as 'cheeky' as they wanted in sharing memorable stories of the 75-year-old. Pallbearers bring in the coffin on 'Animal' to the Wayside Chapel at Kings Cross in Sydney's inner city . Hundreds turned out for the memorial service as many shared jokes and laughed about the 75-year-old's colourful life . There were more smiles than tears during the ceremony as people were asked to remain positive and keep light hearted . One of the speakers who identified himself as 'Dave' told of how he almost committed suicide before his run in with Animal . Reverend Graham Long said that 'A good man has died...he traded in his OAM for an OMG at the pearly gates' Wayside Chaplain Graham Long made several jokes during the ceremony . There was no shortage of support at Sydney's Kings Cross on Saturday . Motorcycles were Animal's most prized possessions and it was said that he never washed his motorcycle . Children, pets, patches and flowers adorned the coffin before it was brought in to the Wayside Chapel . Over four decades Animal helped countless charities and individuals in need and it was in 2004 that the then NSW Governor was awarded him an Order of Australia. In 1989, along with fellow riders 'Steptoe' and 'Feral', Animal founded the Kings Cross Bikers club . 'Our club charter is clear,' Animal once said. 'We look after the elderly, we visit the jails, we counsel the sick and addicted...and we make sure no one gives their family up' Animal died of a long battle with lung cancer at age 75 . 'A bloke with a beard, a bike a banner and a big heart' Randall 'Animal' Nelson was loved by all . Former State Governor Marie Bashir declared she 'envied.' Animal, a man who over four decades helped countless charities and individuals in need and it was in 2004 that the then NSW Governor was awarded him an Order of Australia. 'I was the proudest girl in the world to have my photograph taken alongside him on his motorbike,' Ms Bashir said. 'It still sits on my desk in Governor House.' She said to her, Animal was a friend, and no  matter what status you held in society he treated everyone equally. 'He had an innate, incredible kindness and had the well-being of sick children in his mind,' she said. 'Bikies, if I can call them that, for what I can say I envied them for all their excursions.' The unlikely friendship was  one which many others shared with the 75-year-old including 'Dave' who was one of of Animal's many adopted children. They first met when he was 15-years-old. 'I was on my way to commit suicide,' Dave recalled. 'But then this guy came up to me in a leather jacket....it was the first Christmas present I'd been given.' Animal handed him a two-year-old Easy rider magazine and a pair of socks. 'I read that magazine until it fell apart and wore those socks until they wore themselves.' Before his death Animal described his childhood as 's***house'. Very little was actually known about his past, but It was generally agreed he spent years in state-run homes in Victoria and left school as young as 12 to work as a jackaroo. There might have been a serious horse-riding accident along the way, and it appeared he had ridden a motorcycle into Sydney in 1956. There was a stint in National Service and a couple of stints behind bars. Some media reports claim he has nine children. Close friends say they know of none. In 1989, along with fellow riders 'Steptoe' and 'Feral', he found the Kings Cross Bikers club. 'Our club charter is clear,' Animal once said. 'We look after the elderly, we visit the jails, we counsel the sick and addicted...and we make sure no one gives their family up.' Dame Marie Bashir presented Animal with an OAM in 2004 and said she 'envied' during the service on Saturday . Former Governor Marie Bashir shook hands with friends of Animal's during the almost two hour service at Kings Cross . One of Animal's adopted daughters, Eva spoke at the memorial service on Saturday . Animal! Dogs were on show throughout the two-hour service .

For two decades he spent part of every day in his sixth-floor public housing unit at Waterloo, in inner-city Sydney sorting, wrapping and packing presents for Sydney's sick and underprivileged until his death last month from cancer. To thousands of admirers he was the Kings Cross Santa Claus, and just like Santa's fabled North Pole workshop, the old biker's tiny inner-city home was packed year-round with Christmas gifts. An emotional President of Kings Cross Bikers club Rick 'Chips' Johnson said he was not a man of 'material' wealth, however he did hold one possession close to his heart more than any other - his 'trusty steed.' 'Material things didn't matter,' Chips said. 'But his trusty steed (motor-tricycle) was the one and only possession of importance.' St Vincent's Hospital chairman Peter Joseph said Animal was 'a bloke with a beard, a bike and a banner and a big heart.' 'As far as I was concerned he had a heart as big as Pharlap.' He was a champion for everyone doing it tough, including those holed up in a hospital  facing imminent closure in the mid 1990s by the then state Labor Government. Cost saving measures were being introduced and part of the hospital was preparing to be relocated to Kogarah, in Sydney's south. Mr Joseph said Animal was one of the driving forces which helped save the hospital from ruin. 'We were running full page advertisements in The Sydney Morning Herald,' he said. 'We needed names to put on this open letter, and we didn't want names from the big end of town we wanted people from all over.' A call to a man  named Animal had his signature on a piece of paper and today it means St Vincent's Hospital stands as one of the nation's fore-running health units. 'We won that battle and the rest was history.' Ron Brown, president of the National Servicemen's Association, said he was 'one in a million.' 'He always gave his time and energy.' For many, Animal played a major role in their lives . President of the Kings Cross Bikers club and pallbearer 'Chips' was emotional during the service .

"A Portland, Oregon chemistry teacher has been arrested and charged with making methamphetamine in a case drawing comparisons to television's gritty drug saga Breaking Bad. Alexander Rudine, 38, a community college instructor pursuing a doctorate in chemistry at Portland State University, pleaded not guilty on Wednesday to felony charges that he possessed, delivered and manufactured methamphetamine near a school, according to court documents. His neighborhood is nestled between two parks with an elementary school only 790 feet away, which is why he also has been charged with manufacturing meth near a school. He is  a former chemistry teacher at Mount Hood Community College. The real Walter White?: A Portland State University  chemistry student and former community college teacher, Alexander Rudine, is accused of possessing, manufacturing and delivering meth . In the lab: Former teacher Alexander Rudine, pictured here in a school laboratory, is accused of using his chemistry knowledge to produce and sell the drug meth . Uncanny similarity: Alexander Rudine's story is being compared to that of Walter White on Breaking Bad,  a chemistry teacher who makes meth to support his family after learning he has cancer . Look familiar?: If allegations are true, Rudine is a bit like Walter White who was a chemistry teacher who turned to making meth and selling it . In addition to finding methamphetamine and drug-using paraphernalia, police found 'notes on how to re-crystallize methamphetamine along with a hand-written scientific formula at the bottom of the page,' Multnomah County Deputy District Attorney Christopher Shull wrote in an affidavit. The saga has people drawing parallels on social media and in local news reports on Thursday to the television drama that chronicles the downward spiral of Walter White, a 50-something high school chemistry teacher in the throes of a mid-life crisis who is diagnosed with terminal lung cancer. To leave a nest egg for his wife and two children, White uses his chemistry knowledge to make and sell methamphetamine, an addictive street drug also known as crystal meth. Police searched Rudine's home on Tuesday after receiving a tip from a suspected drug-runner, Shull wrote in the affidavit, filed on Wednesday. Rudine told a court that he had taken leave from his teaching job and doctorate program to enter drug treatment. KPTV reports that Rudine was sitting on his porch when deputies approached him. In his pocket he was carrying $1,510 in cash along with 16 grams of meth in his waistband. Court documents show that 14 more grams of meth were discovered in the basement and Rudine admitted to police, without questioning, that they belonged to him. Also arrested on the scene was Morgan Amanda Clingings, 39, on a felony outstanding warrant for burglary charges, reports Fox. Also arrested: In Rudine's home was Morgan Amanda Clingings, 39, who was arrested on a felony outstanding warrant for burglary charges . Drug history: Alexander Rudine has two convictions for manufacture and delivery of a controlled substance in 1997 and possession of a controlled substance in 1998 . Seeking treatment: Rudine told police he left both school and work so that he could seek addiction treatment . Popular teacher: Alexander Rudine was graded a 4.1/5 of Rate My Professor, a site dedicated to evaluating college professors and their teaching styles . A third person was interviewed on the scene but released. The investigation is ongoing and more charges are expected. This isn't the first time Rudine has been arrested on drug charges. Rudine has two convictions for manufacture and delivery of a controlled substance in 1997 and possession of a controlled substance in 1998. He was arrested other times for similar drug charges but the cases were later dismissed. A pre-trial hearing is scheduled for October 23. According to Rudine's Rate My Professor profile online, he was a popular and 'energetic' teacher among students while employed at Mount Hood Community College. His numerical rating was a 4.1 out of 5. 'I took the 5 week Chem course. The amount of material covered in that short amount of time made it challenging. However, Alex was organized and expectations were clear. He stayed energetic and excited about the material even after hours of lecture. He was always very approachable and helpful. His study guides and practice exams helped, ' writes one student. Another student criticized Rudine's lessons as 'not making any sense' but it's unclear as to whether Rudine was using drugs while teaching at the college.","Alexander Rudine, 38, a community college instructor pursuing a doctorate in chemistry, pleaded not guilty on drug charges .
Police found Rudine with $1,510 of cash in his pocket along with a total of 30 grams of meth .

"A Queensland mother has received an anonymous note in her letterbox accusing her of being a negligent parent. Trish LaForty, 26, arrived to her home on the Sunshine Coast in Queensland after a family day at the beach with her son Will on Thursday to find the insulting letter in her mailbox. The note read: 'You may be able to ignore your baby crying but we are tired of listening to him crying non-stop all day.' Shocked: Mother Trish LaForty, 26, (pictured left with her 11-month-old son Will) was left stunned after a disgruntled neighbour left a letter (pictured right) in her mailbox accusing her of being a negligent parent . Ms LaForty says the letter left her 'shocked and emotional. No mum wants to hear that message, regardless of how true it is.' She has been living in the Coolum apartment block for six months, and had never had any bad blood with her neighbours before this. Ms LaForty soon after posted the following message on a sunshine community Facebook page. 'To whoever wrote this note: thanks. Like being a parent isn't tough enough... You didn't even have the guts to come knock on our door. 'Like being a parent isn't tough enough': Ms LaForty (pictured left with her son) posted a picture of the note online accompanied by her response (pictured right) 'FYI Our baby doesn't cry 'all day', he cries when he doesn't want do go to sleep, when he's getting his nappy changed and when I say 'no' because I refuse to let him be spoiled and run around like he owns the joint.

Positive response: Ms LaForty says she has been inundated with messages of support after her post . 'The message quickly had over 500 likes', she said. 'After that, my inbox was flooded with messages of support and encouragement.' After this, Ms LaForty decided to speak with her immediate neighbours. 'I wanted to clear the air, but also to find out if anyone had experienced any similar notes.' She said all of her neighbors were shocked, and had as little idea as her who was behind the note. 'I still have have no idea who it is. I guess it could be someone who sits at home all day with nothing better to do. 'Maybe they could have offered a helping hand rather than writing than writing a silly letter?' Ms LaForty says people should be more considerate of parents with young children. 'Every baby has good days and bad days. Parents should be able to have the support from their community,' she said. 'I think it's sad that there are still people out there who lack the true feel of what a community should be.'","Trish LaForty, 26, found the note in her mailbox on Thursday .

"A rail passenger was said to have 'almost fainted' after being presented with a £1,048 bill by ticket inspectors after mistakenly boarding the wrong train. The unnamed man, thought to be in his 40s, had been travelling from Birmingham New Street station to London Euston with a group of 38 family and friends. The group had bought tickets that only permitted them to travel on London Midland services. The man was travelling from Birmingham New Street to London Euston with a group of 38 family and friends . However, each member of the party unwittingly boarded a faster Virgin Trains service when they arrived on the platform. The mistake was spotted by ticket inspectors shortly after the 10.30am service had left Birmingham and was pulling in to Coventry station. It was then that they were told that their tickets were not valid, and that they would have to purchase new tickets for the entire 1hr 25min journey. They were told that the cost for the group to travel to the next stop - 100 miles away in Watford – would cost them a total of £800, while the price of completing their journey to London would be more than £1,000. The group were only permitted to travel on a London Midlands service from Birmingham to London Euston . They group each paid up after being told that they would face a large fine if they didn't buy the correct tickets. To make matters worse, they have since been told that had they booked in advance and taken advantage of Virgin's offers for groups, they would have paid of maximum of less than £300 for the entire party – more than £700 cheaper than what they eventually paid. A fellow passenger told the Birmingham Mail: 'It was a pretty heart-stopping moment. 'He looked a little faint and I'm not surprised really, I mean, it's such a lot of money. The party have since been told that had they booked in advance and taken advantage of Virgin's offers for groups, they would have paid of maximum of less than £300  – £700 cheaper than what they eventually paid . 'The inspector was very matter of fact about it all and I understand he was doing his job – but it was an honest mistake. 'I think allowances should be made when it does look like a genuine error.' The inspector told the party that he had clearly announced on board that tickets for any other operator would not be accepted on board the Virgin Trains Service. London Midland charges between £6 and £70 for a single adult ticket from Birmingham New Street to London Euston during weekdays, while Virgin Trains charges between £20 to £82 for an adult. The cost depends on whether passengers travel in standard class or first class. Virgin Trains states that it issues Unpaid Fare Notices (UFNs) to customers travelling without valid tickets who are unable to pay at the time. A spokesman for the operator said: 'If people are travelling in large groups we encourage them to make the most of our group offers; on our Birmingham to London route, fares would start at £7.50 for an adult single fare. 'That would mean all 39 could have travelled for a maximum price of less than £300. 'We run three trains an hour between Birmingham and London Euston, with journey times of 1 hour 25 minutes. 'Unfortunately, if passengers have booked to travel with another operator their tickets are not valid on Virgin Trains' services.'","Man was travelling with 38 friends when mistake was spotted by inspectors .

"Members of Alpha Epsilon Pi in Atlanta woke up the Sunday morning after Yom Kippur to discover the outside of their chapter house had been defaced by swastika graffiti. According to Business Insider, a photo appeared on social media showing the international Jewish fraternity's house at Emory University with two swastikas painted on the front. Emory police are investigating the graffiti and have stepped up patrols around the fraternity house, according to a statement released by Emory president James Wagner. Defaced: Dr Hugh Flax shared the photo on Twitter, saying it had been sent to him by a frat brother whose sons knew members of the fraternity. The individual in the photo is a member of the chapter house. 'It is an offense against a Jewish fraternity and the Jewish members of our community, and it is a repugnant, flagrant emblem of anti-Semitism,' Wagner said in a statement. 'Among the many pernicious things the swastika symbolizes, in the last century it represented the most egregious and determined undermining of intellectual freedom and truth-seeking,' Wagner added. In a statement released by the Emory chapter of AEPi, the fraternity said it is working with the university to 'ensure that intolerable acts of hate, such as this, will never occur again.' The photo was shared on Twitter by Dr Hugh Flax, who calls Emory his 'alma mater' and says the photo was sent to him by a frat brother whose sons know AEPi members . Swastika graffiti was also discovered in September at the university library, according to the Emory Wheel, though police have not said the incidents are connected. It is also not the first time that  AEPi has been targeted by vandals. In 2009, the Gainesville Sun reports that a chapter house at the University of Florida was painted with a swastika. Yom Kippur, considered to be the holiest day of the year in the Jewish faith, ended on Saturday evening.","Graffiti was painted on the Alpha Epsilon Pi chapter house and discovered the morning after Yom Kippur ended .

"Mama June has insisted that her children are her top priority in a new video released today - despite damning evidence that she has allowed them to be in contact with her daughter's molester. The 'Here Come Honey Boo Boo' star spoke out after she was pictured with Mark McDaniel, 53, who was jailed for 10 years for abusing her daughter, Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell, when she was eight. But in videos obtained exclusively by MailOnline on Wednesday, Mama June smiled as she maintained that she had not recently spoken to McDaniel. 'The protection of my kids is my number one priority,' she said outside her Georgia home. 'We are handling this as a family matter,' she said. 'We are doing it behind closed doors, that's how I am. I'm very quiet. I love my family... We're handling what happens privately.' Scroll down for videos . Unapologetic: Mama June is pictured speaking outside her house on Wednesday, just days after her show, Here Comes Honey Boo Boo, was canceled amid reports she was seeing a child molester . Denial: As she joked outside her house, she said that she has not spoken to the man, Mark McDaniel, recently . She added that she will grant a full interview soon - perhaps over the next few days - but would not give an exact date. It will come 'when the time is right', she said. 'I have to think about my family, my kids, I have a lot of things to think about,' she said on the video. 'My kids are my number one priority.' It comes just days after she posted an unapologetic video to Facebook insisting that reports of her having a relationship with McDaniel were false. 'The statement of me dating a sex offender is totally untrue,' she said. 'I would not ever, ever, ever, ever put my kids in danger.' 'Priorities': She said that she had recently spoken to her daughter Anna, who accused her former boyfriend of molesting her as a child. Anna has said that Mama June did not believe her when she told her . But photographs have emerged showing evidence to the contrary, including an image of them together in bed. Another photograph reveals Mama June sitting on a staircase with her nine-year-old daughter, Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson behind her. McDaniel sits behind Alana, with his hand on her shoulder. Despite Mama June's protests, TLC announced they are cancelling the series over how she has allowed contact between McDaniel and her children. The concerns come just months after McDaniel was released from his 10-year prison stint for aggravated child molestation - a charge relating to Mama June's oldest daughter, Anna. A sickening police report from 2003 shows how, after revealing the abuse to her elementary school teacher, Anna told the officer that McDaniel molested her in June's bedroom while she was at work. She told authorities that she had done the 'S word' with Mark McDaniel, the report shared by RadarOnline reveals. Back in her life: Mama June is pictured beside her nine-year-old daughter Alana, also known as Honey Boo Boo, and her former boyfriend Mark McDaniel (back), who was jailed for assaulting her older daughter . She also told police that her mother's boyfriend touched her inappropriately, made her touch him inappropriately and forced her to perform a sex act on him. When she told him to stop, he would not. The molestation was carried out multiple times between April and October 2002 but it took Anna months to speak out because McDaniel had threatened to kill her if she told,RadarOnline reported. 'Anna stated that Mark told her not to tell because he would not like her anymore,' the police report said. 'Anna advised she got tired of holding it in and had to tell.' Speaking to the National Enquirer in 2012, Anna's ex-boyfriend added: 'Anna told me that McDaniel threatened that if she ever told her grandparents what happened to her, he’d kill them and her.' According to Spalding County Superior Court documents obtained by RadarOnline, Anna's younger sister Lauryn - then just three - was beside her in the bed on at least one occasion. Sickening: Mark McDaniel, pictured, was sentenced to 10 years in prison for child molestation. Anna said he repeatedly abused her in 2002 and threatened to kill her and her family if she told anyone . Devastated: Anna 'Chickadee' Cardwell sobs in the arms of Entertainment Tonight correspondent Nischelle Turner as she talks about how hurt she is that her mother has been seen with her molester . In June 2003, McDaniel was indicted for child molestation, aggravated child molestation and aggravated sexual battery in Henry County but the case was soon dropped. He was then indicted in Spalding County for rape, child molestation, aggravated child molestation, enticing a child for indecent purposes and aggravated sexual battery. McDaniel was sentenced to 10 years behind bars after pleading guilty to child molestation. He left prison in March and has reportedly been seeing Mama June again. Earlier this week, Anna revealed to People magazine that when she told her mother what McDaniel had done to her, June did not believe her. 'A week or so after it happened, I talked to Mama and she was upset, crying and saying, ""I don't believe you, I don't believe you, why would you do this to me?""' she remembered. 'And I was like, ""Mama, he did that to me and I can't do anything about it. You were never there to see it. You were always at work"".' Out and about: Alana 'Honey Boo Boo' Thompson was seen out with her sister Lauryn on Tuesday . Moving on: Anna, left with her husband and right with their daughter, said she is hurt by reports that her mother could be back together with her abuser - and that they will not be allowed to come near her child . McDaniel is not the only sex offender Mama June has dated. She also went out with Michael Anthony Ford, 37, the father of her 17-year-old daughter Jessica 'Chubbs' Shannon. After the pair split, he served more than two years in prison for the sexual exploitation of a child over the internet in 2005 and remains on the sex offender registry. According to prison records, Ford is currently behind bars on a separate child abandonment charge. The fathers of Shannon’s other children also have criminal records but rather than being sex-related their crimes included arson and burglary.","Mama June has appeared in videos shared exclusively with MailOnline saying that she will give an interview about the scandal when the time is right .

"Sandwich restaurant chain Jimmy John's said there was a potential security breach involving customers' credit and debit card data at 216 of its stores and franchised locations on July 30. An intruder stole log-in credentials from the company's vendor and used the credentials to remotely access the point-of-sale systems at some corporate and franchised locations between June 16 and September 5, the company said. The chain is the latest victim in a series of security breaches among retailers such as Target Corp (TGT.N), Michaels Stores Inc and Neiman Marcus. More than 12 of the affected Jimmy John's stores are in Chicago area (but this store is not confirmed as being affected by the breach) Home Depot Inc (HD.N) said last week some 56 million payment cards were likely compromised in a cyberattack at its stores, suggesting the hacking attack at the home improvement chain was larger than the breach at Target Corp.

"New laws could give Russian courts the right to seize foreign-owned assets, in a move seen as a backlash against Western sanctions over the Ukraine crisis. A draft submitted to parliament on Wednesday by a pro-Kremlin deputy would also allow state compensation for individuals whose property is seized by overseas courts. Italian authorities this week seized property worth about £23million($40 million) belonging to companies controlled by Arkady Rotenberg, an ally of President Vladimir Putin. Scroll down for video . The Kremlin and St Basil's Cathedral, Moscow: A draft law submitted to parliament on Wednesday by a pro-Kremlin deputy would allow Russian courts to seize foreign-owned assets in the country . The draft law, published on a parliamentary database, would allow for compensation for Russian citizens who suffer because of an 'unlawful court act' in a foreign jurisdiction. It would also clear the way to foreign state assets in Russia being seized, even if they are subject to international immunity. Boris Nemtsov, a Kremlin critic who in the late 1990s was a senior member of government, said the bill was an attempt by Putin to shield Russian billionaires and officials from the impact of sanctions. 'What is a strongman's friendship like?' he asked rhetorically on his Facebook page. 'It is when your four villas, apartment and hotel are seized in Italy, and your accomplice in the Kremlin immediately introduces a bill to compensate for the losses from the Russian budget.' Boris Nemtsov, left, a Kremlin critic who in the late 1990s was a senior member of government, said the bill was an attempt by Vladimir Putin, right, to shield Russian billionaires and officials from the impact of sanctions . Russia and the West are locked in their worst standoff in decades over the Ukraine crisis. Western powers have introduced several sets of sanctions against Moscow, ranging from visa bans and asset freezes to caps on access to overseas capital markets for Russian firms. Russia responded by introducing food bans against EU agriculture producers and has threatened more retaliatory measures if the West presses ahead with sanctions. Russia's economy is set to stagnate in the next two years as the country pays the price for the Ukraine crisis, lack of structural reforms and uncertain economic policy, the World Bank said in a report this week. Russian laws require three readings in the lower house and the approval of the upper house before going to Putin to be signed into law.","Comes after Italian court seized £23million of property from Putin ally .

Crimea does not have a land connection with Russia and still relies on Ukraine - which does not recognise Russia's March annexation - for several key products and services, including water and electricity,The Moscow Times said. There have been reports of dairy and confectionery shortages in the region, but not meat - yet - the paper said. Apart from those bodies and that of a third person who was identified as a separatist fighter, Reuters correspondents saw a further six bodies in the burnt-out mini-van and on streets nearby. The regional administration said a total of 10 people had been killed in the shelling in the city, a stronghold of Russian-backed rebels waging a separatist rebellion against the pro-Western government in Kiev. Rebels put the number of dead at 12, saying two victims had been removed from the scene. Nine others were wounded, seven of whom were taken to hospital, the municipality said in a statement on its website. City authorities blamed the shelling on the rebels and the separatists blamed it on government forces. It interrupted a fragile ceasefire in a conflict in which about 3,500 people have been killed, according to U.N. figures. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said last week there were clear signs that the ceasefire that came into force on Sept. 5, the cornerstone of his peace plan to end six months of conflict, was working. But it has begun to fray with the deaths on Monday and Tuesday of nine Ukrainian servicemen in clashes with separatists. The school is in a city district a few kilometres from the city's main airport where separatists have been trying to dislodge government forces for some days. Since the rebellions erupted in eastern Ukraine in April and shelling began in Donetsk, authorities have introduced distance-learning courses for children to allow them to stay at home. School No. 57 has capacity for 400 children although only the 50-60 assembled for classes on Wednesday. There were pools of blood inside the school and the floor was strewn with broken glass and overturned school tables. Lidia Sheiko, who teaches Russian at the school, said: 'It was a nightmare. There was glass flying everywhere. The children got frightened and began to cry.' Near the shelled school, a Reuters team saw two charred bodies in the mini-van, two more on the pavement and another two on the street about 20 metres (yards) away. Pupils sit in their temporary classroom on the first day of school in the Gymnasium 33 school in Donetsk, eastern Ukraine. Students are using a nearby building as their school was damaged in shelling . According to Unicef, 74 schools and 44 kindergartens have been damaged in the Donetsk area in spite of the cease fire .

Parents and a pupil hide in a school basement used as a shelter after shelling in Donetsk on Wednesday . A car had also been hit and destroyed. Rebels at the scene said two people had been killed in it and their bodies had been taken away. A commander of a rebel unit, Viktor Khalyava, said the school was hit by five Uragan rockets fired by the Ukrainians. 'It was a targeted strike on the school,' he said. The municipal authorities however blamed the attack on the school and on the minibus on forces of the rebel 'Donetsk People's Republic.'

"Cancerous tumours may grow faster at night time, a new study has found. Israeli researchers found that cancer cells grow and spread around the body more quickly during sleep, because of the relationship between two receptors in cancer cells. They concluded that giving cancer treatment at night might be more effective than administering drugs in the day time. Tumours may grow and spread more quickly at night time, because of the relationship between two receptors in cancer cells, Israeli researchers found . The study looked at the activity of two receptors in cancer cells in mice. Receptors are protein molecules on the cell's surface or within cells which take in biochemical messages secreted by other cells and pass them on into the cell's interior. Scientists found that a receptor called the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) - which causes cancer cells to grow and migrate - is suppressed by the activity of another receptor. The second receptor binds to a steroid hormone called a glucocorticoid (GC). GC plays a role in maintaining the body's energy levels during the day. It is often called the stress hormone because levels of the GC steroid rise in stressful situations to make the body fully alert. With multiple receptors, the cell receives all sorts of messages at once, and some of these messages can take precedence over others. Scientists found that when the GC receptor is bound to the steroid hormone GC, the activity of the EGFR receptor in promoting the growth and migration of cancer cells is suppressed. They tested levels of EGFR in mice throughout the day and found that the receptor is much more active during sleep and inactive in the early morning waking hours. Researchers explained that levels of GC steroids peak in the day and tail off at night, meaning in the day time the body suppresses EGFR's activity in promoting cancer cell growth. However, in the night when levels of GC steroids are low, EGFR is not suppressed, and promotes growth and migration of cancer cells. The scientists then wanted to know how their findings affected treatment using drugs which fight cancer. It could be more efficient to give anti-cancer drugs at night, the study found . They gave Lapatnib - a drug used to treat breast cancer – to mice with cancer. Lapatnib is designed to inhibit EGFR and so to prevent the growth and migration of the cancer cells. In the experiment, they gave the mice the drug at different times of day. They found that there were significant differences between the sizes of tumours in the different groups of mice, depending on whether they had been given the drug during sleep or waking hours. These findings suggested that it is indeed the rise and fall in the levels of GC steroids over 24 hours that promotes or inhibits the growth of cancer. Researchers concluded that it could be more efficient to give anti-cancer drugs at night. Professor Yosef Yarden, of the Weizmann Institute in Israel, one of the study's researchers, said: 'It seems to be an issue of timing.' 'Cancer treatments are often administered in the daytime, just when the patient's body is suppressing the spread of the cancer on its own. 'What we propose is not a new treatment, but rather a new treatment schedule for some of the current drugs.' The study was published in the journal Nature Communications.","Cancer cells grow and spread at night because of the activity of receptors .

"Mary Kidson, 55, is accused of trying to harm her child by giving her medication that she did not need . A mother accused of poisoning her daughter with a cocktail of drugs went 'doctor shopping' for a diagnosis, a leading expert in children's medicine has said. Dr Neil Fraser, a specialist in treating hormonal disorders in children, also told jurors hearing the case against Mary Kidson it was 'vanishingly rare' for hormonal disease to develop in children, which had not already being diagnosed at birth. Ms Kidson is accused of three counts of unlawfully and maliciously administering drugs, endangering life or inflicting grievous bodily harm, with all the offences alleged to have happened between 2010 and March 2013. The 55-year-old was arrested in March last year after police searched her £475,000 home in Ledbury, Herefordshire, and found 'a very large amount' of medication. Her daughter, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was given thyroid extract and oestrogen tablets. On the second day of the trial today in Worcester Crown Court, Dr Fraser was asked by John Causer, for the prosecution, about Ms Kidson taking her daughter to various doctors and clinics for assessments. 'Normally, once a person has had the common opinion of two or three of the most respected doctors in different parts of the country one might accept the conclusion was genuine and correct but when it gets to eight or more opinions then clearly something is wrong,' Dr Fraser replied. He added: 'It's commonly known as doctor shopping, going around as many as you can until you get the answer you want.' The jury heard how Ms Kidson had, over the years, taken her daughter to several different doctors and put her through a number of assessments to test for an autistic spectrum disorder, speech and language issues and hormonal conditions. At one such assessment, it was concluded 'no significant learning difficulties' were identified, with staff stating that a complaint the girl suffered with 'sensory perception difficulty' was never directly observed, but only reported by Ms Kidson herself. Dr Fraser said Ms Kidson had then sought 'other opinions' from several doctors across the Midlands, and was eventually referred to Great Ormond Street Hospital. 'She (the daughter) was assessed and it was concluded that her formal test results were normal,' he said. Prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court, pictured, that Kidson had then gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear' He added: 'The important thing there is that the formal tests were normal, and it only identified there might be a problem in one small area of development (auditory processing).' Dr Fraser - whose expertise was called in for the serious case review into murdered toddler Daniel Pelka - said an autistic spectrum test was also later carried out, but concluded there was 'no diagnosis of an autistic spectrum disorder'. Asked to look at the case history by the Crown, Dr Fraser had compiled a report drawing on the experiences of three paediatricians and read from its pages during proceedings. He told jurors how at an early age Ms Kidson's daughter had been reported to have had 'delayed language development, but by the age of nine or ten, had none at all'. However he said he had 'insufficient information' to be able to conclude whether the severe language problems had been based on what Ms Kidson's mother may have told speech therapists. Dr Fraser also said that on another occasion, Ms Kidson had taken her daughter for a private MRI scan over regular headaches, and told clinicians her daughter was suffering with lethargy, and delayed puberty. However, he said the MRI scan had turned up 'minor changes', at the time put down to a possible stroke suffered in early childhood, while Ms Kidson's daughter had developed 'later than average, but not abnormally'. Turning to the function of the adrenal glands, which produce hormones, Mr Causer asked Dr Fraser about 'the way Ms Kidson has approached adrenal function' in relation to her daughter. Dr Fraser said the case history suggested Ms Kidson 'had concluded her daughter had a problem with the adrenal gland and treating it would be a good idea'. He added there was 'nothing in the history of examination to suggest this was a genuine medical diagnosis'. Dr Fraser said that in 27 years of service at Birmingham Children's Hospital he saw 'only a handful' of cases of children with hormone disease, which had developed after birth, describing it as 'extremely uncommon'. 'It is very unusual when it happens and there will usually be a specific cause for it, found upon investigation.' The medical history showed, he said, that when tested, Ms Kidson's daughter's results returned 'a normal response'. Opening the trial yesterday, prosecutor John Causer told Worcester Crown Court, that Kidson had gone from 'doctor to doctor' until she found one who 'told her what she wanted to hear'. 'The daughter's health and emotional well-being we're harmed by being shopped around and saddled with treatment which was harmful to her. 'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful. 'Mrs Kidson has taken her daughter from doctor to doctor until she found one who told her what she wanted to hear.' He said that other evidence will be given, noting that computer evidence and 'a very large amount' of medication was seized in a house search by police in March last year. Speaking of the risks posed by the medication, Mr Causer said that in the case of the hydrocortisone, Ms Kidson's daughter was given three times the recommended daily dose and that the effects of suddenly stopping taking the drug were 'extremely dangerous'. He said that the taking of oestrogen could 'result in various undesirable physical developments in the patient', while taking thyroid extract was 'undoubtedly harmful' and could lead to increased bone fractures and heart disease. Mr Causer said it had taken weeks for the victim's thyroid gland 'to recover from taking thyroid extract she did not need'. He also told the jury the matter was 'not an easy case - it's highly emotional', but he urged them to put that to one side as they heard the subsequent days of evidence. He said: 'We're not saying that Mary Kidson set out to harm her daughter or that she is not a loving mother but the consequences of these actions - even of a loving mother - can be very harmful.' Ms Kidson, appearing in custody but formerly of Dymock Road in Ledbury, Herefordshire, denies the charges. The trial, which is expected to last between two and three weeks, continues.

"Britain’s spending on legal aid dwarfs that of every other country in Europe, a report revealed yesterday. At £2billion a year, it is 20 times the European average and more than seven times the amount spent by France or Germany. The Government is pushing through controversial reforms to cut the bloated legal aid budget but the report, by the Council of Europe, warns that this could breach criminals’ human rights. Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is forcing defence barristers in the most expensive criminal trials to accept cuts of nearly a third in publicly-funded fees . The Council, which covers human rights in 47 countries and oversees the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, found that the average spending per nation on legal aid in 2012 was £96million. But for England and Wales the amount spent on providing free legal help was £2billion, way above the next highest, the Netherlands at £378million, France on £288million and Germany on £270million. The figure for England and Wales works out at £32.55 per head of population – only Norway and Northern Ireland spend more. It was five times the European average of £6.76. France spent £4.39, Germany £3.36 and Spain just 62p. The Council of Europe’s 545-page study commented: ‘Decisions have been taken to reduce the budget of legal aid in England and Wales as a consequence of the economic and financial crisis, though such legal aid systems continue to be among the most generous in Europe.’ But it warned that cuts may not be ‘consistent with the requirement and spirit of the European Convention on Human Rights.’ Last year the Coalition slashed annual legal aid spending on civil and family cases by £350million. Ministers have faced a wave of opposition from the legal profession over plans to strip a further £215million a year from criminal cases by 2018-19. People with more than £37,500 of disposable income a year will no longer qualify for legal aid and Justice Secretary Chris Grayling is forcing defence barristers in the most expensive criminal trials to accept cuts of nearly a third in publicly-funded fees. Lawyers have staged a series of strikes and protests at the reforms, claiming justice could be undermined. Campaigners argue they will lead to a shortage of qualified defence lawyers. Earlier this year, a £5million fraud trial was halted when the Prime Minister’s brother, Alex Cameron QC, claimed the defendants could not get a fair trial as barristers were not willing to take on their defence for lowered fees. In May, however, the Appeal Court ruled it must go ahead. The Bar Council, which represents barristers in England and Wales, said the total spending on the judicial system in 2012 – around £4.3billion – worked out at less than £1.57 per person per week. But Conservative MP Dominic Raab said: ‘With British taxpayers shelling out the highest amount of money on legal aid in Europe, the latest whinge from Strasbourg makes no sense. A cynic might say they are more worried about the gravy train of cases they feed off, than offering an accurate picture of our justice system.’ A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We have always said that we had one of the most expensive legal aid systems. ‘In the challenging financial climate, we had to find ways of reducing the burden on hardworking taxpayers whilst still ensuring those most in need of a legally aided lawyer have access to one. ‘Our plans achieve that, and even after reform we will still have a very generous system at around £1.5billion a year.’ Figures released by the Ministry of Justice showed more than 1,000 lawyers are paid over £100,000 a year by taxpayers to appear in criminal courts. The Council of Europe report found that the UK had one of the highest numbers of lawyers and questioned why our Supreme Court judges are among the highest paid. In 2012 they earned £201,000 a year, nearly eight times the average UK salary. The Council also pointed out a severe lack of women judges in the UK – in 2012 only Armenia and Azerbaijan had fewer. In Slovenia, women make up 78 per cent of the judiciary, in Latvia 77 per cent and France 64 per cent. In Britain is it less than 25 per cent.","Britain’s spending on legal aid dwarfs that of every other country in Europe .

"A young disabled boy was left smiling this afternoon, after getting a hug from the Countess of Wessex during her visit to his school. After laying a hand imploringly on her arm, the little boy, who attends the Royal School for Deaf Children in Margate, was treated to a warm embrace from the royal. Sophie then crouched down for a chat, much to the delight of the wheelchair-bound boy, school staff and his parents. Scroll down for video . Hello: Sophie Wessex bends down to greet the youngster during her tour of his school in Margate . All smiles: Both were left wreathed in smiles after the Countess gave the youngster a friendly hug . But the youngster wasn't the only one to get a hug from the Countess. One of his classmates also got a cuddle, leaving him, like his friend, with a face wreathed in smiles. Sophie, who is the school's patron, was there to open a new hydrotherapy pool, disability gym and cafe complex but spent most of the visit getting to know the children. Dressed in a chic cream suit teamed with a pair of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite L.K Bennett 'Sledge' heels, the 49-year-old was every inch the royal style icon as she toured the school. Admiring though the looks directed her way were, this was a visit that really was all about the children and a cause close to Sophie's heart. A long standing supporter of charities dedicated to disability, along with the school, she is also patron of Brainwave, which funds therapy for youngsters with physical difficulties, the Disability Initiative and Dyslexia Action. Earlier, the Countess had spent the morning raising the profile of another cause close to her heart, the plight of people suffering from cancer. In Tunbridge Wells, she visited the local hospital, being shown around the decontamination unit before officially unveiling a memorial to staff who perished during the First World War. Afterwards, she was driven to the nearby Pickering Cancer Drop-in Centre, which helps support anyone affected by the disease. Enjoying the day: Sophie, who also made another youngster smile, was pretty in a cream suit for the visit . Decontamination unit: Before arriving at the Margate school, Sophie visited Tunbridge Wells Hospital .

The visit came in the wake of a busy month for Sophie, who has spent most of it touring the country and hosting charity suppers at Buckingham Palace. Next month is also set to be an engagement-packed one, with a visit to Buckinghamshire, including a tour of the spinal injuries unit at Stoke Mandeville Hospital, among the highlights. Her husband, Prince Edward, also has plenty in his diary, starting with a trip to Birmingham early next week. Neither, however, can beat the Princess Royal when it comes to exotic visits, with the Queen's only daughter scheduled to spend two days travelling in Tanzania and Ethiopia next week on behalf of the Vine Trust and Save the Children.

"'Do you want to see something that will make you feel alive?’ whispers my girlfriend. It’s the middle of the night. Forgive me, but I think my luck could be in. I’m awake in a flash. Turns out I’ve misread the situation, but she’s right about feeling alive. A storm has swept in from the Caribbean Sea on to the Tulum coastline and it’s electric. Wind swirls; rain lashes; blue-white lightning fills the sky. The cabana where we’re staying is 20 yards from the sea, so we sit outside on the terrace and watch the show. Monty Halliday explores the off-the-beaten-path glamour of Mexico's Tulum Bay coastline . We’re on the Mexican coast, two hours south of Cancun. Tulum Bay is a three-mile stretch of sand. Once the preserve of backpackers and yoga nuts, it now attracts a more chic crowd and bohemian film stars such as Sienna Miller, who wander along the beach nibbling on coconuts, waxing surfboards and snapping photographs of one another. The vibe is Goa meets Jamaica with a few ancient ruins thrown in. We’ve booked through Mr and Mrs Smith, staying in three different places. First up is Papaya Playa, where 100 or so cabins line a private beach. By day, guests congregate at the bar or lounge by the sea. Primitive, but pristine, like an upmarket gap year. No sooner do I flop onto the sand than a wide-eyed Mexican introduces himself as Mariano and asks if I’d like a contest of bat and ball? Sure would. After much prancing and pirouetting to boost our rally count, he slaps me on the back. ‘Amigo, we’ve earned ourselves a beer.’ With that we stroll up to the bar. This sets the scene perfectly. Tulum is more relaxed than an iguana on a hot rock. Locals like to call it ‘off the grid’ because it’s funky. It’s also disconnected from the mainland power supply, so don’t pack anything more than a phone charger. At Papaya Playa, two hours south of Cancun, 100 or so cabins line a primitive, yet pristine private beach . Perhaps unsurprisingly, bohemian-chic celebrities, like Sienna Miller, are also fans of this lush paradise . The food’s not bad, either. If you’re after something authentically Mexican, try the aptly named Simple, down at the south end of the bay on the jungle side of the road. Whopping garlic butter lobsters and octopus with pea puree is the norm here, all accompanied by shots of mescal — tequila’s younger cousin. On route, we pass small gatherings of people looking for mother turtles hauling themselves out of the ocean to lay their eggs. There’s a strong conservation ethos here. If boutique hotels and New York bohemians aren’t your thing, then try the Grand Velas north of Tulum on the Riviera Maya, where we stop before heading inland. As you approach, it looks like a Roman fort. It has an array of suites across a vast acreage of jungle running towards to the sea. It’s so large the hotel has its own safari car to venture into the undergrowth, where you’ll find birdlife to satisfy even the most practised ornithologist. Don't love boutique hotels? Try the Grand Velas resort on the Riviera Maya . We drive inland to the hidden city of Vallodolid, a colonial outpost of Spanish arcades and spas. Here, the Yucatan peninsula was home to the Mayan civilisation, a society highly advanced in art, trade, and temple-building. Well worth a visit is the Coqui Coqui perfumery, near the city centre. Imagine an ancient townhouse where the Franciscan monks who colonised the Yucatan in the 16th century and concocted herbal remedies and perfumes. This is where Nicolas Malleville, who set up and runs Coqui Coqui with his wife Francesca Bonato, takes his inspiration. He spent years researching the monks’ techniques to create a vast range of room scents, aftershaves and perfumes. In Vallodolid, the Coqui Coqui perfumery creates a vast range of scents, inspired by the monks' techniques . Monty and his girlfriend stayed at the perfumery's sister establishment, located an hour away in Coba, Mexico . We actually stayed at a Coqui Coqui sister establishment about an hour away in Coba. The hotel overlooks a crocodile-laden lagoon and if there’s ever a time to sport your Indiana Jones hat, this is it. Coba was once home to 100,000 people. A scattering of old structures have been uncovered, but 6,500 more are thought to be below the surface. For all the man-made wonders of the world, our most exhilarating experience in Coba comes from a purely natural source. Cenotes, or sinkholes, are formed from the collapse of limestone bedrock to create wondrous cave lakes — we feel as if we are hunting for one of Lord Voldemort’s horcruxes as we descend 60ft. A deep pool greets us. As I dive in, the icy sensation shoots from head to toe. It’s an electric grand finale to a thrilling Mexican adventure. Mr and Mrs Smith (033 100 3180, mrandmrssmith.com) has doubles at Papaya Playa from £77 per night, room only; doubles at Coqui Coqui Tulum from £177 a night, and Coqui Coqui Coba from £140 a night, room only (including price-match pledge).

"A grandfather who previously spent every day eating junk food on the couch has shed three stone by becoming a bodybuilder. Roland Burton began exercising after piling on weight following his retirement so that he would be able to play with his 14 grandchildren. The 65-year-old from Wisbech, Cambridgeshire joined a gym in an effort to get fit, and within three years was crowned the best in his age category at a bodybuilding competition. Roland Burton shed three stone and 18 inches through training to become a bodybuilder after setting a goal to get fit so he could play with his grandchildren . Before losing weight, Mr Burton snacked on chocolate, crisps and biscuits while drinking endless of cups of sugary tea every day. 'I retired from my job as a car dealer and my days were spent on the sofa eating out of boredom,' he said. 'I could rest a cup of tea on my stomach as it stuck out so much. 'I didn't do any exercise but I wanted to be able to play with my grandchildren properly and see them grow up.' On a holiday in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk, the former car dealer became 'transfixed' with weightlifting after watching a bodybuilding competition. 'Once I lost some weight, I soon noticed a difference. For the first time in years, I could actually do my shoelaces up. 'We went to the competition at the Atlantis Arena and I was transfixed. I knew straight away that I fancied having a go at bodybuilding. The 65-year-old gave up his sugary diet and began training with a professional and his son in the gym every day . 'I’d really been enjoying myself at the gym and thought training for a competition would push me.' Despite his wife Margaret's concerns, Mr Burton began training with his trainer Paul and son Hal in preparation for a competition. 'The competitors had six packs and huge muscles, while I was an old man. 'I trained in the gym for two hours a day, five days a week mostly doing weights and a bit of cardio. I could curl 55 pounds and could press 240 kilos with my legs.' While Mr Burton enjoyed his time in the gym, his reformed diet was less enjoyable. 'To be honest, the food was boring. I was only eating steak, rice and vegetables. I wasn't allowed any of my favourite junk food that I'd previously gorged on, but it worked wonders for my self-control. 'For the last two months of the diet, I had to cut out carbs completely - which was really tough.' As the competition grew closer, Mrs Burton dismissed her concerns and began helping her husband prepare by applying his fake tan. 'I had to help Roland apply the fake tan. It was everywhere so we had to put old sheets on the bed to prevent orange streaks.' The grandfather's wife, Margaret, was concerned at first he may hurt himself but came around in time to help him apply fake tan before his first competition . After retiring from his job as a car dealer, Mr Burton sank into bad eating habits and a lazy daily routine. He would spend hours in front of the television gorging on biscuits, crisps and chocolate, with scampi and chips his favourite meal. Endless cups of sugary tea went along with his food intake, and he did no exercise. After vowing to get fit, Mr Burton gave up his  stuck to a diet of rice, steak and vegetables. Initially just running, the 65-year-old began spending longer amounts of time on other parts of his body. He soon spent two hours in the gym, five days a week, curling 55kgs and pressing 240kgs with his legs. In just six months, Roland’s gruelling fitness and diet regime led to him losing an incredible 3st 7lbs, and  18 inches from his waist. And in his first competition in June, the grandfather was top  in the over 50s category. 'For the first time in my life, I have a six pack. Initially, I was worried because I didn’t want to look silly in front of the other competitors. 'But even my grandchildren were impressed. I felt great.' 'My whole family watched me compete and cheered me on as I strutted my stuff on stage to my chosen song Rollin’ by Limp Bizkit. 'When I won, I couldn’t believe it - I didn’t think I’d have a chance.' 'Bodybuilding changed my life and my body - my muscles looked great - and I’m much happier now.'","Roland Burton piled on weight after retiring from his job as a car dealer .

"Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky won re-election to a sixth term, on Tuesday, fending off a challenge from Kentucky Secretary of State Grimes and boosting Republican hopes of taking control of the upper chamber. The win sets McConnell, 72, up as the likely majority leader of that body if Republicans pick off Democrats in a handful of other combative races tonight. In a victory speech McConnell said his reelection was proof positive that 'we can do better as a nation.' Tonight Kentuckians 'said we can have real change in Washington. Real change. And that's what I intend to deliver,' McConnell told a room full of cheering fans. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell,  joined by his wife, former Labor Secretary Elaine Chao, celebrated Tuesady with his supporters at an election night party in Louisville, Ky. Tough loss: Grimes ended up losing to McConnell by 15 points in what was expected to be a fairly close race . McConnell, who was first elected in 1984, defeated Grimes, a 35-year-old Democrat. Once a promising pick-up opportunity for Democrats, Grimes' numbers tanked after she refused to say during the campaign whether she voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012. McConnell has battled low approval ratings at home, but he successfully hammered away at Grimes, and her approval rating, over her lack of transparency and support for Obama. In their only debate, in mid-October, McConnell sought to wrap Grimes in Obama's weak approval ratings, while Grimes said McConnell represented Washington more than Kentucky after 30 years in office. McConnell said he would work to repeal Obamacare, the president's signature piece of legislation. It will most certainly be a main target for Republicans if the party wrestles control of the Senate from Democrats. National Democrats pulled ad buys from the state in a blow to Grimes after she serially declined to state her support for Obama but brought them back in the closing weeks as polls showed the race still tight. In the end McConnell pulled off a double-digit victory over Grimes, 56-41, when 91 percent of the votes had been tallied. In her speech Grimes acknowledged that 'tonight didn't bring us the result we had hoped to.' But 'this journey, the fight for you, it was worth it,' she told her supporters . At a much more somber party across town, Kentucky's Democratic Gov. Steve Beshear said he 'couldn't be prouder' of Grimes than he was tonight 'because she took every blow there was to take from millions and millions of dollars, and she's still standing straight up.' In a speech of her own Grimes acknowledged that 'tonight didn't bring us the result we had hoped to.' But 'this journey, the fight for you, it was worth it,' she told her supporters. 'My hope is the message has been sent to Congress' that it needs to increase the minimum wage, close the gender pay gap, and bring 'good paying' jobs to Kentucky, she added. 'This journey, this fight was for each and every one of you, and I will work my hardest to keep this amazing organization that we have built together intact to fight for a brighter and better future,' she promised. Serving as the opening act for McConnell was fellow Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who was not up for reelection this year. Paul told attendees of McConnell's event that President Barack Obama and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid had 'trampled on their liberties.' 'That ends tonight,' he said to cheers. 'Instead of maligning American business, we will cultivate american business and cultivate America's job making machine,' he told them, . 'We say to Hillary Clinton, yes businesses do create jobs,' the likely presidential candidate said, taking a jab at possible challenger Clinton. Sen. Rand Paul (left) stood with McConnell and Chao, calling the election a referendum on not just Barack Obama but also Hillary Clinton -- whom he will try to marginalize during a 2016 White House campaign . McConnell's wife, former Secretary of Labor Elaine Chao, lauded her her husband as he came on stage. 'In times like these, we've never needed a leader more like Mitch McConnell,' she said. 'Mitch is committed to restoring Americans' faith government. He's passionate about expanding opportunities for all Kentuckians. And he will never back down from defending what is right. 'He is incredibly dedicated to the people of this commonwealth, he has never forgotten his roots.' That's 'one of the reasons' Chao said she has always 'admired' her husband. Taking an opportunity to show her lighter side, Chao said there's another reason she's glad that her husband won his race tonight. 'Mitch couldn't be more grateful for your support, and I couldn't be more grateful that Mitch will have something to do that will keep him busy for the next six years,' she said to laughter. 'I mean I love the man, but I don't want him for lunch every day.' Joining his wife on stage McConnell said 'tonight turns a corner' in Kentucky, 'and the future I see tonight is a bright one.' 'It's time to go in a new direction. It's time to turn this country around. And I will not let you down,' he declared.","The win sets McConnell up as the likely majority leader of the Senate if Republicans pick off Democrats in a handful of other combative races .

"As an Olympic diver, there is no doubting he has a head for heights. But on this occasion, Tom Daley looked a little more apprehensive than usual. The 20-year-old diver was taking a ride on Falcon's Fury, the new ride at Florida's Busch Gardens theme park. The ride stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. And Tom's trepidation is probably understandable – it is ten-times higher than his usual diving board height. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee. Sophie starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global. Riders are seated upright and whisked to the top of the 335-foot tower before the seat pivots 90 degrees so the guest is looking straight down. The ride then plunges in a six-second free fall. Falcon's Fury stands at 335ft high (102 metres) with riders dropping 60 mph straight down, face first. It is the tallest freestanding rollercoaster structure in North America. Riders plunge down in a six-second free fall . Tom described the ride as 'awesome'. Jeff Hornick, director of design and engineering at Busch Gardens, said: 'It's a different kind of thrill ride than a roller coaster. 'It's really polarizing. You're either really going to want to ride it or not want to ride it at all.' Park officials say it's the tallest, free-standing drop tower in North America and the only one in the world to feature forward tilting seats. Tom was joined on the ride, opened in May, by his best friend Sophie Lee, who starred alongside him in TV show Tom Daley Goes Global . Hornick says guests can see downtown Tampa and even St. Petersburg, some 30 miles away from the top of the ride. Once riders get to the top of the tower, a computer program determines how long it stays at the peak before the gut-wrenching plunge. Hornick said the wait time at the top will be randomised, anywhere from one to five seconds. During the drop, riders will experience an estimated G-force of 3.5gs. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia . Engineers had to drive 105 steel support beams as deep as 205ft into the ground before fusing them together with a concrete cap to make it secure. A 4ft-thick base also secures the steel tower to the foundation. Falcon's Fury is the centerpiece of a newly designed section in the park called Pantopia that includes new retail and food areas. The park wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows. 'Drop towers have been popular at theme parks for many years, but what you see with Falcon's Fury is the industry's relentless drive for innovation,' said Jeremy Schoolfield, editor-in-chief of Funworld Magazine. Busch Gardens wanted more of a scary, thrill ride to debut this year following a few years of new family friendly rides and stage shows . 'Ride designers are always looking for new twists on classic attractions, and Fury's pivoting seats certainly fit that bill. 'Putting riders in a facedown position as they drop toward the ground is definitely a new take on this type of ride.' There are taller drop towers in the U.S., but they are integrated with other rides or buildings. Lex Luthor: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Magic Mountain in California has a 400-foot drop and the Zumanjaro: Drop of Doom at Six Flags Great Adventure in New Jersey will have a 415-foot drop when it's constructed later this year. Both of those are attached to other rides. A famous drop tower is the Big Shot, the ride atop the Stratosphere hotel and casino in Las Vegas that catapults riders 160 feet in the air.","Olympian was taking a ride on Falcon's Fury at  Busch Gardens theme park .

"The search continues for two teenage boys who were seen running into bushland on Monday night and survived a second night in the wilderness during the wild storms that hit NSW. An air and ground search has failed to locate the boys, 14-year-olds Deng Lual and Robert Whitfield, who were both last seen entering a reserve in Airds, southwest of Sydney at around 11.40am on Monday. One of the missing boys contacted his mother by phone at 8.50pm that day, telling her they were lost, according to NSW Police. Robert Whitfield, 14, has been missing since Monday. He was last seen running into bushland. That evening, phone contact was made location around seven kilometres away from the boys' last known location. The boys last message said they were lost . Police were able to track the call, completing a triangulation to narrow their search. The call led police to a location seven kilometres away from the original entry point to a location near Keith Longhurst Reserve off Georges River Gorge at Kentlyn. However, a large scale police search involving the local police, the Dog Unit and Polair has failed to locate the teens. Police were forced to halt their search on Tuesday at 3pm, as Sydney’s weather conditions escalated ahead of the major storm that evening. Crews recommenced their search on Wednesday. Deng Lual, 14, has been missing since Monday. Police are appealing to the public for information about the boys' wellbeing and welfare . Police are appealing for information about the welfare or whereabouts of the two boys, and have released photographs to help identify the teens. Robert Whitfield, aged 14, is described as being of Aboriginal/Torres Strait Island appearance, 150cm tall with a thin build, short brown shaved hair and brown eyes. His friend Deng Lual, also aged 14, is described as being of African appearance with a dark complexion, 155 – 160cm tall with a thin build, short dark hair and brown eyes. It’s is understood the boys are not local to the area, both living in Wollongong. Deng Lual, 14, is missing, last seen running into a reserve in Sydney's south-west. The search was halted on Tuesday evening due to the extreme storm that raged throughout Tuesday night . The police chase began when the boys were seen travelling in a black BMW in Bradbury, according to NSW Police. The boys abandoned the car to enter a reserve off Banooke Way. A woman, believed to be Robert Whitfield’s mother, took to Facebook to ask for help finding her son. ‘Were gonna find you today my boy I am not gonna stop till we find you ok (sic),’ she wrote. ‘Please, I’m begging you all, if ur truly my friends n family please come to Campbelltown and help me look for my son.’ ‘My nephew is out there lost, cold and scared. People need to grow up, they are still kids and kids make mistakes,’ another person, believed to be the uncle of one of the boys, wrote another relative. A wild storm on Tuesday night battered Sydney and outer Sydney regions, including the Campbelltown district where the boys were last seen. Winds reached up to 160 km/h, which is considered to be Category 2 cyclone strength and Sydney was pounded with torrential rain and lightning. Many regions of Sydney were affected by flash floods. The boys are thought to have last been in close proximity to Georges River Gorge.","Police continue to search for two teens, last seen on Monday at midday .

"A baby whose heart stopped fro 26 minutes has survived and is now home from hospital after just a month. Midwives at Burnley General Hospital had almost given up on little Isla Simpson when she was born on September 21 and they realised her heart was not beating. Her mother Becky Simpson, 20, had experienced a normal pregnancy and Isla was born after 39 weeks - but it was only during labour that problems began when she was not moving or crying. Becky Simpson, 20, kisses her daughter Isla for the first time after her heart stopped beating for 26 minutes . She was immediately given CPR and her heart finally started again after 26 minutes. Ms Simpson, from Clayton-le-Moors in Lancashire, said: 'They pulled the emergency cord and suddenly about 20 or 30 people were in the ward. 'I was watching them give her CPR and it was terrifying. It went on for 20 minutes, at which point they usually stop, but they kept going and luckily her heartbeat came back.' She continued: 'I saw her a few hours after the birth and it was heart-breaking because she was sedated and still really struggling to breathe. Isla, pictured in the incubator at Burnley General Hospital, was born at 39 weeks but wasn't moving or crying . 'She looked blue and her organs were starting to die from the lack of oxygen. 'The doctors thought she wasn't going to survive and that whole week was the hardest of my life. Every day we were told to prepare ourselves for the worst.' Following the birth, Isla spent a week on a ventilator in the neo-natal intensive care unit. Doctors were still unsure whether she would make it, but she kept breathing once the ventilator was removed. Ms Simpson added: 'I had decided that if she couldn't breathe without the machine I would let her go - it was causing her so much pain to have it down her throat.' Isla has suffered brain damage due to a lack of oxygen to the brain, but the extent of it is not yet known. It is also likely she will have cerebral palsy. After just a month in hospital Isla has been allowed home with her mother but she has suffered brain damage . Becky Simpson, pictured with almost five-week old baby Isla, says she feels like the 'luckiest mum in the world' The single mother says she feels like the luckiest in the world and added: 'I think she can still have a very good life. 'We'll try and do as much as we can for her by taking her to all sorts of different classes and not just sit her in front of the telly. 'When she's awake she's very alert and reacts when I talk to her. 'She's here and that's the main thing.' Doctors have not been able to explain why Isla's heart was not beating when she was born. Angela O'Toole, midwife matron at Burnley General Hospital, said: 'All the staff used their expertise and professionalism in ensuring Isla had safe, personal and effective care. 'The staff supported Becky through a difficult time and we are overwhelmed that she has taken the opportunity to publicise this. 'Everyone in the unit will miss Becky and Isla, but it's obviously brilliant that they are able to go home as a family and we wish them all the best for the future.' Her heart began beating again after 26 minutes of emergency CPR and stayed on a ventilator for a week .","Midwives at Burnley General Hospital had almost given up on Isla Simpson .

"A disabled former soldier said he felt 'like a dog' after being thrown out of a gastro-pub for trying to sell poppies. Patrick Tobin, who left service with a disability pension after fighting in Northern Ireland, was trying to raise money for Royal British Legion when he visited Garden Bar and Grill in Kensington, west London. The 76-year-old was about to approach customers when bar staff refused him entry, leaving him 'humiliated'. Humiliated: Patrick Tobin said he was made to feel 'like a dog' after being thrown out of the pub in Kensington where he was trying to raise money for the Royal British Legion Poppy Appeal . 'I was going into the garden, he barred my way. He didn't want me to go out there,' the veteran said. 'He boxed me off and wouldn't let me go down. I'm disgusted about it.' Mr Tobin, who has been selling poppies in the area every year for decades, was given no choice but to leave the pub in embarrassment. 'I was humiliated. I felt like a dog, I was absolutely gobsmacked.' Local residents who have seen Mr Tobin collecting on behalf of the charity for years were horrified by the exchange. Zohra Hussain, who works in a local shop near said: 'It is an important part of life here. They do it every year. It’s bad, we feel bad. 'It is unusual for an area like this.' One local serviceman who did not want to be named added: 'This is Britain, poppies are part and parcel of Britain. 'It’s a disgrace.' Outraged customers have taken to the pub's Facebook page in complaint. The pub's manager said the incident was down to a staff member's poor grasp of English and has donated £40 to the charity since . 'Most of the families living here had a family member go to war. I hope the company and all the staff have poppies on and make a large donation to the poppy appeal,' Tracey Anthony wrote. John Mitchell added: 'Shame on you. One of your staff has put shame on your company. 'Poppies are a part of UK heritage, and your company is in the UK so your staff should have respect.' Bardi Berisha, the bar's manager, put the incident down to staff members' poor grasp of English. 'To be clear the Garden bar has always proudly supported the poppy appeal every year and this year in no different. 'If Mr Poppy man would like to return, I will personally buy all his poppies,' he said. Mr Berisha added he had donated £40 to Royal British Legion since the incident.","Patrick Tobin thrown out of Garden Bar and Grill while collecting charity .

"An Arizona couple have tied the knot in a unique wedding ceremony held on the main stage at their local state fair. Dereck Mast and his new wife Rhonda, who attend the Arizona State Fair every year, exchanged vows in front of a group of friends, family members and several bemused fair-goers and even danced their way off the stage after saying 'I do', much to the amusement of their guests. 'We wanted a carnival theme so I thought I'd talk to the fair and see if we could do it here,' Rhonda told AZ Family shortly after the ceremony.

The couple, who have been together for ten years, spent two years planning the unique celebration and eagerly embraced all aspects of the carnival theme. Both Rhonda and Dereck came up with a number of personal touches to ensure that they would remember their day forever. While the bride carried a traditional bouquet, all 10 of her bridesmaids opted to forgo their flowers in favor 'bouquets' of traditional pink cotton candy.

"Since turning 35 earlier this month, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has decided to freeze her eggs. The TV star, who shot to fame after winning Alan Sugar's approval on the BBC reality show has made the tough decision after reaching her mid-thirties without finding The One. But the choice also centres around Michelle's successful career in business, which she believes would face a setback if she took time out right now to have children. Scroll down for video . Since turning 35 earlier this month, Apprentice winner Michelle Dewberry has decided to freeze her eggs. The Apprentice winner made the decision because of career ambitions, but also because she wants to find the right life partner without the pressure from her biological clock . She made the revelation after Google and Apple's announcement this week that they would be providing financial support to female employees who wanted to freeze their eggs. Michelle said: 'We live in this society now where it used to be that women stayed at home, the chap was the breadwinner, but times have now changed because we have a choice. 'Lots of women want to stay at home, but I’m in a position now where I want to focus on my career. 'I believe that I can achieve anything that I want in the workplace and the one thing that is restricting me is my biological clock . 'It’s a mixture of three things, I have an awful lot that I want to achieve in my career, I haven’t met the right guy yet that I want to settle down with and also I feel like I’m just not ready.' And the career woman is quick to dismiss any speculation that women who feel like this are lacking in maternal instinct. Michelle Dewberry with Alan Sugar after winning The Apprentice in 2006 . She told This Morning earlier today: 'I absolutely want to be a mum. 'When I think my future, it absolutely involves family - family means the world to me, but I’m just not ready to be a mum. 'What I want is the choice.' Now in her mid-thirties, Michelle and her friends have reached a common age where conversation on nights out inevitably turns to one thing - motherhood. She said: 'I turned 35 a couple of days ago and the topic of who is going to have kids, when we’re going to have kids -  there are so many cocktails that (my friends and I) have drunk while discussing that topic. 'You go round and round and it drives you mad. 'I don’t want that pressure in my life. I don’t want to meet a guy in a bar and instead of getting to know him, be trying to find out whether he wants kids, when he’d want them and his intentions for the future.' So Michelle is hoping that by freezing her eggs, she will manage to both alleviate the time pressures on her body clock, but also achieve all of her career ambitions before she finally settles down to have a family. She said: 'I want to be a mum when  I am still young enough to enjoy the kids, ideally for me it would be early forties. 'As a woman it’s really hard to decide when is the right time and who is the right person - freezing your eggs is almost an insurance policy. Michelle appeared on This Morning today to talk about her decision . 'But hopefully life will move on and nature will take it’s course and I’ll meet someone who is awesome, settle down with them, have a family and probably not even use these eggs.' Michelle believes that for these reasons, Apple and Google are right to offer to cover the procedure costs of up to £12,600 when it comes to freezing eggs. She said: 'There are so many people saying that they just want to control you as an employee, that’s ridiculous, this company asked what is important to their employees and this is what they came up with.

"An ex-marathon runner who piled on the pounds after getting married, going from a size 10 to a size 20, has finally beaten her demons by losing five stone. Nicola Meehan, 28, from Wilmslow, Cheshire, was fit and active, working out regularly and even competing in the London marathon. But after marrying her husband, Michael, 32, the newlywed began regularly eat takeaways and chocolate, going up to a size 20 and weighing in at 15st. Scroll down for video . Nicola Meehan was extremely fit in her early twenties, even taking part in the London marathon (left). But after getting married, she started to pile on the pounds and ended up tipping the scales at 15 stone (right) After being shocked by the number on the scales, Nicola finally decided to do something about her size. She joined Weight Watchers and now weighs 10st 1lb. Nicola, a mother-of-two, said: 'When I was younger I was always very active and I exercised a lot. 'Then when I was training for the marathon I was constantly running and burning off the calories. 'But the marathon was such hard work - it put me off running for life. 'I made sure I was slim for my wedding, but after that I just wasn't as bothered. 'I knew I was putting on weight, but I was very happy so it didn't really get me down. 'It wasn't until my friend asked me if I wanted to join Weight Watchers with her that I realised I was too big. 'Luckily, I found it really easy and lost weight really quickly. After getting married to her husband Michael Meehan, Nicola started to snack regularly on takeaways and chocolate . 'Now I'm even too skinny for my wedding dress.' Nicola had always been slim, but it was when she became settled into married life that she began to put on weight. Nicola said: 'After I got married my life consisted of working and eating. 'I always said I was going to start a diet, but I'd have a mars bar and then say I'd start tomorrow. 'I did know I was putting on weight but I wasn't depressed. 'My husband was very active but he never brought it up. 'It was just really gradual, and then I became pregnant - I thought it was marvelous that I could eat for two. After having two children, Nicola struggled to lose the weight and ended up wearing her maternity clothes long after giving birth . 'Looking back at pictures now, I look horrendous, but at the time I'd look in the mirror and think I looked good.' Despite Nicola's confidence, she slowly began to realise she was piling on the pounds. She said: 'I remember once I had a pair of size 16 maternity trousers and they wouldn't fit. 'I had to ask my sister to swap them for a size 20, but the shop didn't stock them. 'I stayed wearing my maternity clothes even when I wasn't pregnant - they were the only clothes that fit me. 'I couldn't go down the slide or on the swings with my daughter. 'Even my wedding rings were too tight, they were well and truly stuck on my fingers.' It was only when Nicola's best friend suggested they join Weight Watchers together, that Nicola finally started to change her ways. After joining WeightWatchers, Nicola quickly lost weight and is now the slimmest she has ever been . Nicola said: 'Someone I know at a baby group has asked me if I wanted to join a slimming club, and at the time I was a little insulted. 'But then my best friend, who was in a similar position to me, asked me if I wanted to go to Weight Watchers with her and I just thought I might as well. 'Before I went to my first meeting I decided to weigh myself - I hadn't for ages and wanted to know what I was letting myself in for. 'When I saw that I was 15 stone I just couldn't believe it. 'I used to run marathons - I didn't realise I'd got that big. 'It was a shock.' Luckily, Nicola found Weight Watchers easy, and the weight quickly melted off. Breakfast: Two pieces of toast . Snack: Mars bar . Lunch: Salad with cheese and lots of mayonnaise . Snack: Chocolate bar . Dinner: Chinese takeaway . Breakfast: Banana and porridge . Lunch: Two crumpets with half a tin of beans, fruit and yoghurt . Dinner: Salmon, baked potato, and salad . Snack: Curly Wurly and a digestive biscuit . She said: 'I got to my goal weight of 11st 1lbs pretty quickly, but I decided I wanted to lose more than that so I lost a bit more. 'There wasn't a day that went by that I wasn't motivated to lose the weight. 'It was great because I didn't feel like I was on a diet, it was a lifestyle change.' Now, Nicola weighs in at a healthy 10st 1lb, and is happier than ever. She said: 'I wish I joined Weight Watchers years ago. 'I just feel really happy and healthy. 'I'm even hoping to become a weight watchers leader one day - I want people to enjoy losing weight as much as I did. It has  changed my life.' Have YOU had a similar experience?

"They are an ancient tribal group  famed for creating beautifully ornate gold objects and then hiding rich hoards in times of enemy invasions and unrest. And it seems the Thracians, who were bordered by the Ancient Greeks to the south, were particularly skilled at making jewellery. Archaeologists have uncovered a haul of ancient artefacts ranging from gold earrings, delicate beads and ornaments to pottery at the Thracian Tomb of Sveshtari in Bulgaria. Dating back to the third century BC the well preserved tomb was discovered in 1982 and reveals that the culture was inspired by Hellenistic Greece, the period between the death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC and 146 BC. According to archaeologist Diana Gergova the relics date back to around the end of the fourth or beginning of the third century BC. The antiquity of Thrace dates back to ancient Greek legends and the first historical record of the group is found in the Iliad where they are described as allies of the Trojans in the Trojan War. They inhabited a large area in Southeastern Europe with the Bosphorus Strait, the Balkan Mountains, and the Rhodope Mountains as geographical boundaries. Modern-day Thrace consists of the southeastern regions of Bulgaria, northwestern Greece, and the parts of Turkey that separate the Black Sea from the Sea of Marmara.

"Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, again told reporters on Friday that he would recommend U.S. ground troops take on the Islamic State if he felt it was necessary. 'I stand by the statement,' he said when asked about testimony before a Senate committee last week in which he first made the assertion. ‘I will recommend… what it takes to destroy ISIS.' Dempsey reiterated that there isn't an 'air power alone solution' and it may take the use of force on the ground to eliminate the barbaric terrorist group. However, he indicated that ground troops 'would be comprised of Iraqis, Kurds and moderate Syrian opposition' and not necessarily American forces, as was intimated from his previous remarks. Dempsey had said last week that he may advice President Obama to boots on the ground in Iraq - something Obama has said he will not do - if the president's preferred strategy doesn't have the intended effect. Gen. Martin Dempsey indicated that ground troops 'would be comprised of Iraqis, Kurds and moderate Syrian opposition' and not necessarily American forces, as was intimated from his previous remarks . Kurds from Turkey and Syria break down the barbed wire at the Turkey-Syria border near Suruc, Turkey, today. About 1,000 Kurdish activists arrived at the border after a more than 750 mile overnight bus ride from Istanbul in response to a call for mass mobilization by the imprisoned leader of the PKK rebel group, Abdullah Ocalan . The four-star general told members of the Senate Armed Services Committee U.S. forces could engage in 'close combat advising' if the circumstances called for it. Hypothetically speaking, Dempsey said American troops could end up 'accompanying' the Iraqi army during a skirmish with ISIS while taking back city of Mosul. Dempsey revealed to the Senators that Obama told him privately 'to come back to him on a case-by-case basis' as far as boots on the ground are concerned. The following day Dempsey told reporters  that assessors sent into Iraq by the U.S. military found that 24 of the army's 50 brigades were incapable of putting their sectarian differences aside to effectively work together. The other 26 brigades would need additional training and more equipment, Dempsey said. That same day Obama denied that he was considering going back on his promise that he would not put American troops into combat situations. 'I want to be clear: The American forces that have been deployed to Iraq do not and will not have a combat mission,' he told an service men and women at MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Florida, during a speech. As of today, the U.S. had already dropped 272 bombs and missiles on Syria and 374 on Iraq. Here Kurdish protesters clash with Turkish police and soldiers at the Turkish-Syria border line near Kobane, Syria, during a protest against Islamic State. The Islamic State extremist group has stepped up efforts to capture the Kurdish town of Kobane in recent days . David Petraeus, a four-star general and former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, pictured here at the Aspen Ideas Festival in June, said he too believes ground troops may be needed in the fight against ISIS but he said not to underestimate the Iraqi army . Retired General David Petraeus said today that while he too believes ground troops could be needed to finish the job in Iraq and Syria, he thinks the Iraqi army may able to do it themselves, eventually. 'What we’re doing right now is disrupting. We are gradually chipping away at the strength' of ISIS, the former Bush and Obama administration said, according to Bloomberg. Petraeus told business executives at a Tokyo hotel that it could take 'many years' to resolve the situation in Syria. In terms of Iraq, he said, 'I do believe the Iraqis can be the ground forces that can deal with this over time, but again it will be months and years, not days or weeks.' Petraeus' opinion on the situation in Iraq is notable given his position overseeing the so-called surge in Iraq at the end of George W. Bush's second term in office. The four-star general went on to serve as head of U.S. Central Command and Commander of the U.S. forces in Afghanistan before being promoted to President Barack Obama's national security team in 2011. Petreaus served as director of the Central Intelligence Agency until it was revealed in late 2012 that he'd had an extra-marital affair with his biographer. Since then, he'd mostly stayed out of the public spotlight until the U.S. reinvolved itself in Iraq earlier this summer. 'We have invested a great deal in that country, we have given them hope on two different occasions and I think it’s very legitimate [that] United States officials are supporting a process that is led by Iraqi officials,' Petraeus said in June in remarks at the Aspen Ideas Festival reported on by The Washington Times. Petraeus said on Friday that past experience battling al Qaeda in western Pakistan proves that if the U.S. leaves Iraq to it's own devices now, terrorist threats will rise back up. 'We have seen this elsewhere,' he said. 'You have to keep on disrupting. If you let up the pressure, then al Qaeda senior leadership will come back.' The retired military officer said he thought the Iraqis would eventually be able to solve their own problems and indicated that leaders should have more faith in the Iraqi army's ability to ward off ISIS. 'I believe you should not underestimate the residual capacity of the Iraqi security forces and we should not overestimate the capabilities of ISIL,' he said.","Dempsey reiterated that there isn't an 'air power alone solution' and it may take the use of force on the ground to eliminate the terrorist group .

"Convicted killer Joran Van der Sloot broke down in tears and clutched his young bride's hand, pleading: 'Help me, please help me.' The once-swaggering Dutchman recently went on a hunger strike after he was moved from a relaxed jail to one of the most notorious prisons in Peru. He claims it is 'worse than Guantanamo Bay' and that he and other inmates are beaten. And in an interview with MailOnline his pregnant wife, Leidy Figueroa, 25, said he is close to the breaking point after becoming deeply depressed by his new living conditions. Many would find it hard to conjure up a scrap of sympathy for Van der Sloot after he was transferred to the feared Challapalca prison four weeks ago. The killer - serving 28 years for murdering a Peruvian student in 2010 - remains the prime suspect in the 2005 disappearance of 18-year-old American high school graduate Natalee Holloway in Aruba. Crying: Van der Sloot believes he was set up when he recorded a video in his former jail above on what authorities said was an 'illegal' cell phone. Van der Sloot then threatened to kill the prison director . Depressed: Van der Sloot's pregnant wife told MailOnline that hels 'been beaten by the guards and lost weight' Since his arrival at the jail, which sits at an altitude of 16,000 ft in a remote mountainous area of southern Peru, Van der Sloot's physical condition has deteriorated. Leidy, who is nine months pregnant with his daughter, fears he could die. She said: 'It makes me sad to see him like that, he's in very bad condition, he has been beaten by the guards and has lost a lot of weight and is very depressed, I am scared he will die in there.' After her last visit three weeks ago, Van der Sloot handed Leidy a scrawled letter and asked her to sneak it out of the prison and hand it to the Dutch Embassy. The letter, written in Dutch, is a cry for help asking the Dutch authorities to intervene and remove him from the 'inhumane' conditions at the prison. The handwriting is scruffy and disjointed – different to the neat love letters he would write to Leidy from his last jail. It reads: 'Help please. I am not allowed to have pen or paper, nothing. They beat us. There is no light, nothing... no pen and paper, help please.' It adds: 'Holland, please help. This is worse than Guantanamo. It is 5000m high, there is no light and no water, we are locked up 24 hours. It is cold, have no clothes and they are beating us.' Leidy added: 'When I saw him he cried in my arms, and he asked me to help him, I held him and we prayed.' The prison's conditions are in stark contrast to those under which Van der Sloot fell in love with Leidy in an unlikely prison romance four years ago. The couple were even allowed to marry behind bars earlier this summer. Lax prison rules also meant he was able to play online poker, use a cellphone, take drugs and have other women come and go as he pleased. And he enjoyed teaching English to other inmates and doing arts and crafts. Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca after he threatened to kill the warden of the Piedras Gordas penitentiary in Lima. He was found with an illegal cellphone which was confiscated, officials of the Inpe prisons administration said. Van der Sloot even recorded a video in which he showed the conditions in his cell, later saying that it was warden Sergio Haro who provided him with the cellphone. Privileges: Leidy said that Van der Sloot can't make the ceramic art he's been sending her at the new jail . Fears: Leidy, who is due to have Van der Sloot's child any day now said that the killer has been told he'll never see his baby daughter after she is born now he's been moved to maximum security jail 16,000ft up in the Andes . 'The warden himself gave it to me. I don't know why, but I suspect that it was to set a trap for me,' said Van der Sloot in a portion of the video. According to Leidy, Warden Haro was furious and told her husband he had never liked him. Van der Sloot was immediately thrown in the 'Hole' – solitary confinement – for six days. Leidy said: 'When he came out of the Hole the warden told Joran that he won't see his baby daughter when she's born. Joran didn't believe him but the warden is true to his word.' Weeks later Van der Sloot was transferred to Challapalca prison on August 23. 'I can't take our daughter to see him because it is so far and there is little oxygen which would make it very difficult for my baby to breath,' explained a distraught Leidy, speaking at her apartment in Lima. 'Now he is going to be a father he really wants to see his daughter, but he knows he can't and he is suffering a lot. People may say Joran deserves that and that he's a monster - but he has feelings. 'I believe this is God’s way of testing us, I have not been able to sleep.' Since Van der Sloot's transfer, visiting her husband has become very difficult for Leidy. Challapalca is in the Andes near the Bolivian border, about 211 kilometers from the nearest city of Puno - a six-hour ride down a dirt road, depending on conditions, according to a 2003 report on the facility by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights. The jail - known to house problem prisoners - is feared by criminals across Peru for its harsh regime and grinding conditions. It has been the focus of many investigations for human rights abuses. There is no regular electricity or running water, and temperatures most of the year hover around 33 degrees Fahrenheit in the day and as low as 20 degrees below zero at night. He and Leidy are no longer able to enjoy conjugal visits either. Harsh: The Challapalca prison is often cited in international human rights reports. It has no regular electricity or running water and temperatures hover around 33F most of the yera and -20F at night . Prime suspect: Van der Sloot gained notoriety when he became the prime suspect in the disappearance of Natalee Holloway (left) in 2005. He hasn't been charged over her disappearance. But he was sentenced to 28 years in hail for strangling a Peruvian student, Stephany Flores, to death in 2010 . Leidy, 25, said: 'There is no water, no electricity. There is no rehabilitation for Joran, no doctor no clinic. A doctor comes once every 15 days, that's it. There’s no internet like in the old prison, no workshops, so he can't paint or make his ceramics, that makes him very depressed. 'The guards are brutal and regularly beat the prisoners. I've heard some inmates have been beaten to death and their autopsy will say natural causes, I fear for Joran’s life.' Leidy said her husband's physical condition is very poor and his body bears the marks of a recent savage beating. 'When I saw him his body and back were badly bruised, his face and nose swollen, his trousers and his shoes were ripped and he was dirty,' she explained. 'He says the food is horrible and when I visit he is kept in chains. 'Before he arrived he knew the conditions would be bad, but he wasn't prepared for this nightmare. 'Joran told me he is in bad shape and asked me to help him, he asked me to get him out of there. He is very depressed and he was crying in my arms. We held each other and prayed, I am so upset for him.' The length of Van der Sloot's stay in Challapalca will depend on his behavior, Inpe officials said. If he behaves properly he could be transferred soon to another prison with better accommodations, such as are available at the cushy Piedras Gordas. Tears welling up in her eyes Leidy says that only God can now help her husband. 'It makes me feel bad that Joran is so depressed. I going to church a lot asking God to help me because he’s the only one who can make a difference. I once said to Joran, ""Everything we do we pay the consequences."" 'I know he has killed, but you pay for what you do and living in this hell-hole is God's punishment. 'Of course I understand what he did was wrong. I am a mother, I wouldn't want to lose a child and go through what Stephany Flores' parents went through. 'But I know in my heart Joran has changed. People who know him can see the difference, we are all human beings. God blessed us with a wedding and a daughter. 'He will always have me and will always have a daughter who loves him. All we have left is to fight through this struggle. My Joran is not a monster and I have forgiven him.' Leidy is confident that one day she and Van der Sloot will be together properly. 'Somehow one day he’s going to leave prison and we can be a family,' she said. Strip search: Footage emerged of Van der Sloot being patted down when he was transferred to the new jail . However, Van der Sloot is expected to remain in prison until 2038 and then be extradited to the United States to face charges of extortion and fraud for allegedly falsely promising to lead Natalee Holloway's mother to the girl's body in exchange for $25,000 payment. The murderer was the last person seen with Holloway, who vanished while on a high school graduation trip to Aruba. No charges were filed against Van der Sloot and the case remains unsolved. In 2010, he confessed to killing Stephany Flores, a 21-year-old business student, five years to the day after Holloway's disappearance.","Killer was moved to maximum security jail after threatening to kill warden .

"Just in time for spring, scientists hope to launch a 'Shazam for birds' that will help people identify the tweets that are waking them up in the morning. The app, dubbed Warblr, claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species, and could help track their migration patterns. Like Shazam, it works by recording nearby noises on smartphones to analyse it in real-time and identify the bird species according to its tweets. Scroll down for video . Just in time for spring, scientists hope to launch a 'Shazam for birds' that will help people find out which birds are waking you up in the morning. The app, dubbed Warblr, claims to be able to recognise the song of 88 bird species, and could help track their migration patterns . Whenever the app identifies a bird, geo-tracking allows it to map which species is being spotted where and when, with the information made public. The information will be made publicly available to allow zoologists and ecologists monitor species growth and decline, as well as patterns of migration. The app, developed by two scientists using a grant from Queen Mary University of London, is currently raising funding for development on Kickstarter. At the time of writing, the campaign has raised £3,290 ($5,300) towards its £50,000 ($80,570) goal. Whenever the app identifies a bird, geo-tracking allows it to map which species are being spotted where and when, with the information made public. Pictured on the left is a bluethroat and on the right a bee eater . After recording the bird song, the app returns a list of the most likely results, with percentage indicating their levels of likelihood. However, initial test with the BBC found that the app still needs to iron out some problems. For instance, Warblr struggled to distinguish between a canada goose and screaming child. It's not uncommon to see a pretty bird flit by when you are enjoying a walk or a picnic - even if you live in a built-up area. But if your knowledge of flying fauna isn't up to Bill Oddie's standards, it can be difficult to work out which creature you have spotted. But now an app, developed by computer scientists, can identify a bird from a single photo. A team of researchers led by Professor Peter Belhumeur at Columbia Engineering, New York City, have used computer vision and machine learning techniques to create Birdsnap. The free iPhone app claims to be an electronic field guide featuring 500 of the most common North American bird species. It lets users identify bird species by uploading photos and there is also a website, which includes 50,000 images as well as bird calls for each species. Beginners and experts can sort through species alphabetically, by their relationship in the Tree of Life and by the frequency with which they are sighted at a particular place and season. In the first test, the app recorded a canada goose, but interference from a 'screaming child' caused the app to misidentify the calls as those of a crow. The Kickstarter funding, according to the team, is to help address the app's problems which will be sold in the spring for £1.99 ($3.20). Creator, Florence Wilkinson says her goal is 'to bring people closer to the natural world through technology' and help protect the wildlife for the future.

"Disgruntled: Atlon Nolen was allegedly angry about not getting a raise at work before he attacked . The Muslim convert accused of beheading a colleague in Oklahoma has reportedly told cops he felt oppressed at work - particularly over not getting a raise. Alton Nolen, a 30-year-old production line employee for Vaughan Foods in Moore, was fired on Thursday after getting in trouble for his performance and for trying to convert colleagues to Islam, officials told CNN. On Monday, law enforcement officials were preparing to file a murder charge against Nolen for walking back into Vaughan Foods after being fired and allegedly beheading 54-year-old grandmother Colleen Hufford. He then allegedly began attacking 43-year-old Traci Johnson before being shot by Mark Vaughan, the company's chiefoperating officer who is also a sheriff's deputy. Johnson is expected to recover, while Nolen  underwent surgery and is also expected to survive. Authorities waited until he was coherent and could . understand the charges before placing him under arrest on Friday . afternoon, they said. He is also expected to face a charge of assault and battery with a deadly weapon for the stabbing of Johnson. The FBI is also looking into . Nolen's background for any  religious ties to the . attack after  colleagues said he had attempted to convert . them to Islam. Police said Nolen had recently become a Muslim.

The scene is pictured on Thursday . On Nolen's Facebook page, listed under the name Jah'Keem Yisrael, he posted photos of Osama bin Laden and Taliban fighters, along with posts condemning a variety of aspects of American life. Posts ranged from religious iconography to stock photography to even photos of supposed UFO activity. It also included a graphic photo of a beheading. On Sunday, a woman who said she was Nolen's mother took to social media . to apologize to the victims of the attack. 'My heart is just so heavy right now,' Joyce Nolen said in a . Facebook post. 'My son was raised up . believing in God. I want to apologize to both families, because this is not . Alton.'

Megan Nolen, the suspect's sister, said in the same video . that Alton was not a violent person. Nolen's family members have said also that they were surprised to learn of his conversion and never spoke about Islam explicitly with them. 'I spoke to him once he was released, and when we spoke, there was nothing of the sort,' said Nolen's cousin, James Fulsom, from Fort Worth, Texas. 'I don't believe he was converted (to Islam) in prison.' As recently as February, Fulsom said that when he talked to Nolen there was no mention of his conversion. 'He was just talking about what he was going to start doing, how he was going to get his life on track, and was ready to be focused on his future,' Fulsom told the Associated Press. Nolen had a non-violent criminal record, including drug-related arrests, a jail escape and resisting police,authorities said. But it emerged that Nolen  served less than two years of a six-year prison sentence for possession of cocaine with intent to distribute, reports News OK.

He began his six-year sentence for cocaine possession April 26, 2011, records show - but due to plea agreements with prosecutors, he was allowed to serve the three prison sentences at the same time. He was released on March 22, 2013, records show. 'Our intent was to incarcerate him much longer than a year and 11 months,' Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said Friday. 'This case perfectly illustrates the problem with the Department of Corrections.' Hufford, who had been married for 25 years, had lost her family home in the Moore tornado. Her neighbors described her as 'quick to smile' and said her husband picked her up from the food processing plant every night and he was outside when he found out she had been killed.","Alton Nolen, 30, 'walked into Vaughan Foods in Moore, Oklahoma after being fired on Thursday and attacked the first two people he came across'

"I was the man who had everything. I made a fortune, married a beautiful wife, had five children, and then fulfilled my lifelong ambition. Ever since my school days I wanted to be a politician. My election to represent my Essex constituency of Braintree in 2005 was one of the proudest moments of my life. So too was joining the Government as Minister for Civil Society. Now my political career is in ruins. I have traumatised my family and let down my constituents and my colleagues. Many will regard me as a failure. Tory MP Brooks Newmark said he has 'traumatised' his family after it emerged he sent explicit pictures to two women, pictured with his wife Lucy . And it is true: behind the outward facade of success and achievement, I have been battling demons – and losing to them. I craved adrenaline and risk. Stress at work drove me to increasingly erratic behaviour. My friends warned me that I was cracking up. I ignored them. Late at night, I began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media. Deep inside, I knew I was playing with fire. Now it has consumed me and my family. When a newspaper exposed one of these episodes – involving a male freelance reporter using stolen pictures to impersonate a young female Conservative Party activist – I stood down as a Minister. Now, in response to what seems to be a new text-and-tell story, I am standing down as an MP at the next Election. The MP began a series of flirtations in response to approaches from women on social media . I want to concentrate on slaying those demons – making me, I hope, a better husband and father, and giving me a chance to contribute in some way to the country in future. True, I made big sacrifices for my career, leaving a highly paid job in finance to dedicate myself to the day-to-day concerns of my constituents in Braintree. Many of my counterparts from Harvard and Oxford days mocked me for this. I tried to explain to them that I wanted to give back: using my privilege and education to help people solve their daily problems – helping them navigate the bureaucratic maze on issues such as welfare and housing, and ensuring that Braintree had its own community hospital. What is the point of making millions when you can change the lives of thousands? But a far greater price was paid by my family. All too often I was an absent dad, arriving home late at night when the children were in bed. I missed family meals, holidays and vital moments in their lives. I will never get those back. Worse, I was emotionally absent, seeking the buzz of achievement when I should have been dealing with the concerns of those nearest and dearest to me: my wife above all. The illusion of success in the Westminster bubble blinded me to reality. Exchanging flirty pictures online is no substitute for the love and companionship that a real marriage offers. I still look back with pride on my campaign to reduce youth unemployment, setting up an education charity in Rwanda and my efforts to encourage women into public life. Amid the wreckage of my political career, it is some comfort to know that this work was not in vain. These causes will remain close to my heart and I will do what I can to further them even when I am no longer in Parliament. I will continue to represent my constituents until the General Election in May. But I am seeking help now. I will be beginning residential psychiatric treatment for the next few weeks in the hope that professional help will enable me to salvage my life and my family. I would like to use this terrible moment in my life to appeal to others who are ashamed of their mental ill-health to seek help before it is too late. I have long argued in Parliament against the stigma which we too often attach to mental illness. But I did not practise what I preached. I talked about my anorexia as a teenager, yet I was never brave enough to admit first that I was suffering from depression, or that I was lapsing into episodes of behaviour that any normal person would regard as bizarre and abhorrent. I realise now – too late – that I need treatment. He stood down as a minister after the Daily Mirror revealed he had sent explicit pictures to a fake account . Many of my friends have advised me to ‘tough this out’. After all, they say, I have not broken any law. I have not stolen any money. Many other politicians have done far worse things to their families – and their careers have survived and even flourished. I have received countless messages of support – from all political quarters and none – along these lines in recent days, and I am profoundly grateful for them. But for me that is not the point. I do not want to be a battle-scarred veteran of Westminster politics. I want to be a person who brings happiness to those around me – and thus to myself. That can come only if I change. I do not blame the media for my downfall. It is for others to judge their behaviour and their ethics. The fault is mine alone. If I had sought help earlier, none of this would have happened. But I do hope that the media will leave me and my family alone as we try to rebuild our lives.","Brooks Newmark plans to step down at next election over graphic photos .

"Georgiana Hibberd (pictured) started out in the property industry almost 40 years ago, when everyday sexism was the norm. She has detailed her experiences in a blog . Georgiana Hibberd started out in the property industry almost 40 years ago, when everyday sexism was the norm. In the last four decades she has risen through the ranks to become Associate Director at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) and says the workplace is almost unrecognisable. She wrote about her experiences in a blog for the RICS, detailed here: . 'When I first started in the property business almost 40 years ago, things were very different for women. 'The whole workplace was very different; behaviours that are today a sackable offence were treated as the norm. 'When I first decided I would like a job in an estate agency, a ‘secretary’ post seemed to be the only place I could start. These days I would be called a sales administrator, though the job is very much the same. 'Everyday sexism was the norm: I remember one day a male property surveyor (as they all were back then) whom I had never met before, came into the office, sat down in front of me, put his feet on my desk and, without so much as a hello, said ‘mine is a coffee, black no sugar’! 'It was not a bad firm but in those days you just accepted that as a woman you were there to support the men. 'You put up with having your bottom pinched or being groped at the office party and there was no point in taking umbrage if you wanted to keep your job. 'It soon became apparent to the boss that my typing was appalling, so I was made a junior estate agent but that was as far as my promotion prospects went. 'I stayed with that particular firm, a good old fashioned partnership, for a couple of years, during which time a number of the male junior negotiators were promoted. 'I was told women didn’t need proper jobs as they could rely on their husbands – and I had children so it would be too risky to promote me. 'I therefore decided I had to be better-qualified than the men if I was to be taken seriously in the business, and obtained a place on a property course. 'Three years later I graduated. 'At that time, the most family friendly place to gain professional experience was in the public sector, so I applied. A meeting of female property surveyors in London in the late seventies . 'Getting an interview was difficult - there was one organisation where I was turned down because they thought I would have trouble ‘combining work with my family commitments’. 'My final interview was with the Civil Service, where I was offered a graduate post. 'Even then there was some wage discrimination: a fellow male graduate, with the same degree, age and estate agency experience was offered a similar graduate position, but with a higher starting salary. 'The office I started in had never had a female property valuer before and when I first arrived there was a big debate as to whether I should be excused from the ladies’ tea rota. 'Fortunately the boss put his foot down and said I had better things to do than make tea. 'Inappropriate behaviour was common - in one office there was a colleague who was an out and out lech who thought nothing of ‘rubbing past’ as you stood at the photocopier; sometimes groping you at the same time. 'Digging him in the ribs or getting annoyed only seemed to increase the pleasure it gave him, so you just avoided being cornered by him. 'Another colleague was also rather ‘hands on’ but not at all in the same way- he would always put his arm around females when explaining things to them. 'He was mortified when I told him that being ‘hands on’ made women uncomfortable, I genuinely believe he didn’t realise how he made us feel or even that he was doing it. In the sixties and seventies, women were often touched inappropriately by men in the workplace (picture posed by models) 'When I went to value property, some members of the public would say to my face that they ‘were expecting a man’ and look concerned as I got on with the job. 'It was not all bad. Dealing a lot of the time with inheritance tax, I used to particularly like negotiating with the gentlemanly land agents who treated me like a lady. 'I had some easy negotiations and think with hindsight they may have been slightly charmed dealing with a woman. Sexism can be double-edged. 'The women’s world of work has changed exponentially for the better over the last 40 years. 'However, I don’t think you can judge history against the standards of today; I just look back on it as if I was involved in a period drama, or maybe a comedy.' To read more go to www.rics.org/uk/ .

"A couple from California are petitioning Disney to create the first ever special needs princess so that their 15-month-old daughter Delaney - an avid animation fan who suffers from Down syndrome - might have a 'real' role model to look up to someday. In their petition, which has already gained the support of more than 62,000 people, Keston Ott-Dahl and her partner Andrea pay tribute to the work that Disney has already done in helping children to understand the difference between right and wrong through its popular animated classics. But they make clear that, in their eyes, the company 'comes up short in one critical area' - the representation of disabled people - and they ask that Disney start taking steps towards changing the lives of special needs children around the world by casting a Down syndrome princess in a future film. Scroll down for video . Doing everything for Delaney: Keston (L) and Andrea want Disney to create a 'real' role model for their 15-month-old daughter . Disney's biggest fan: Delaney is an avid animation fan and loves the company's popular princess flick Frozen . 'She is excluded': Keston and Andrea want their daughter to be able to relate to the characters in her favourite movies . 'Children with Down syndrome are princes and princesses, too!' Keston writes. 'Disney does a great job of depicting right from wrong. It has long provided wonderful moral lessons that teach our children to be good people - but sadly, the company comes up short in one critical area. 'Its movies have almost no representation of disabled people, those often bullied and looked down upon by their fellow children. 'What wonderful lessons of diversity, compassion, and acceptance Disney could teach our kids if they promoted disabled characters as heroes and heroines in their beloved movies!' The two women, who foundedThe Delaney Ott-Dahl Foundation, a charity aimed at providing support to families affected by Down syndrome, first began the campaign after Delaney's six-year-old sister Jules questioned whether her younger sibling would ever get the chance to be a real princess. 'My partner Andrea and I are already outspoken parent activists in the Down's syndrome community, but it took my six year old to recognize that her baby sister Delaney and people like her are excluded on even the most elementary level, even as children,' Keston told the Independent. 'Andrea and I knew we had to do something, not just for Delaney but also for Jules.' Parental support: The couple's petition has already received more than 62,000 signatures . Real role models: Delaney's parents want Disney to create films with disabled princesses so that the 15-month-old is able to see that she can be a hero too . Thus far the petition has received an overwhelming amount of support and is just a few signatures shy of the couple's target of 63,000 supporters. 'We started the Care2 petition with an initial goal of 1,000 signatures,' Keston added. 'We had that in an hour... We had the 10,000 signatures in less than a week.' The petition has attracted support from around the world, with many offering words of encouragement to the couple. 'I am so happy to support this cause! I think I would watch the movie a million times!' one anonymous supporter wrote, while another added: 'Children with Down syndrome are beautiful and innocent people who are full of love and affection and would enhance [Disney's] productions.' And while Keston plans to see the campaign through until the very end - she admits it is only the beginning as far as she and Andrea are concerned. 'My frying pan is just getting warmed up,' the author wrote on her website. 'I want to do everything in my power to make sure that Delaney knows she is included in society, that she has worth and is amazing.'","Keston Ott-Dahl and her partner Andrea are self-confessed Disney fans but believe the company needs to do more to represent disabled people .

"Classmates of Jaylen Fryberg have said the popular schoolboy and recently crowned homecoming prince seemed fine in the days and hours leading up to cafeteria shooting. One friend even described how he had a conversation with the shooter on the morning of the attack where he acted normally. Junior Nathan Heckendorf told CNN that Fryberg had just returned to school after being suspended following a fight during football practice. Scroll down for video . Acted normally beforehand: Classmates of Jaylen Fryberg have said the  recently crowned homecoming prince seemed fine in the days and hours leading up to cafeteria shooting . In an interview with the station, he said: 'His final words that he said to me were about the fight. He said ""It was an act of anger, and an act of aggression and I should have used words"".' Students who knew Fryberg described him as outgoing and unlike the loner personality that is often associated with school shootings. 'He seemed totally normal,' said Gladis Jimenez, 15. 'Yes, he had a lot of friends.' Another student told CNN: 'He seemed like the perfectly normal kid we all knew, everyone knew him. He was always a very nice kid.' At The Grove Church in Marysville, hundreds of parents, students and community members overflowed aisles during a vigil on Friday evening, holding flowers and crying audibly throughout a prayer service. Outside, 9th grader Bella Panjeli said she attended a different school but was friends with one of the female victims, calling her 'a beautiful girl and so, so sweet.' She also said Fryberg was in an ongoing dispute with his cousin over the victim's affections. 'I heard he asked her out and she rebuffed him and was with his cousin,' Panjeli said, adding that she learned of the connection after talking to the victim's family and friends. It was a fight over a girl.' Reputation: A witness to the shooting said Fryberg - who was a member of the school football and wrestling team - was popular and 'always a nice guy' There were no indications on Fryberg's social media accounts that he had been planning such a rampage, and was even seen smiling while posing for a photo after his homecoming dane. But on Tuesday he posted his feelings of despondency, apparently over a romantic split, on Twitter. 'It breaks me... It actually does... I know it seems like I'm sweating it off... But I'm not.. And I never will be able to,' he wrote. Photos uploaded to his Facebook profile also showed that he was a gun enthusiast and keen hunter. One of his posts on Instagram show him holding a 17HMR that he was given for his birthday. All of the victims of the shooting were under 18, and three of the wounded were in critical condition with gunshot wounds to the head, said Joanne Roberts, chief of medicine at Providence Regional Medical Center in Everett. The fourth wounded victim suffered less serious injuries. Describing the deadly attack, Jordan Luton told CNN: 'He came up from behind and had a gun in his hand and he fired about eight bullets ... They were his friends so it wasn't just random. 'Then he turned and looked at me and my girlfriend ... and kind of gave us a smirk and turned around and then shot more bullets outside.' Other witnesses said he had a blank face when he walked into the room full of hundreds of students. Hobbies: Recent photos downloaded onto his Facebook page suggested he enjoyed hunting and was a gun enthusiast. He took a photo posing with a rifle he was given for his birthday .","According to classmates Jaylen Fryberg was outgoing and not a loner .

"Hospitals could start charging patients up to £75-a-night for their 'bed and board' if the health service's looming financial crisis is not addressed, it has been claimed. Patients could be asked to pay 'hotel costs' if funding does not match increasing demand, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation warned. Rob Webster, of the confederation which represents NHS commissioners and providers, said the health service would have to make 'tough choices'. Scroll down for video . A senior NHS source claims the health service could charge patients up to £75-a-night for a bed (file picture) He told The Independent: 'If the NHS cannot afford to fund everything, then it will need to make tough choices about what it does fund. 'Do we think about increasing our tolerance for longer wait (for care), or do we say: ""NHS funding is only for the health aspects of care and treatment"", which means patients being asked to cover their hotel costs for bed and board?' 'Overall funding allocation for health and social care is a political choice. Flat funding in real terms is a choice. Funding that doesn't match an increase in demand is a choice. 'One-off 'lumps' of money, which gets newspaper headlines but don't allow health service leaders to plan effectively, are a choice.' He said plans to charge patients for accommodation had not been drawn up but an unnamed senior NHS source suggested to the newspaper that the fee could be £75 per night. However, a Department of Health spokesman denied that plans to charge for hospital stays were under consideration and said: 'The NHS will remain free at the point of use. 'We know that with an ageing population there's more pressure on the NHS, which is why we've increased the budget by £12.7billion over this parliament and are investing in community services to keep people living healthier at home for longer.' The spokesman added: 'These proposals are not under consideration.' The Department of Health denied the proposals were under consideration and said the NHS would remain free . It comes after a cohort of influential health bodies issued an open letter to the leaders of all three main parties stating the NHS was at 'breaking point'. The Conservatives, Labour and Liberal Democrats have all focused on the NHS and its funding during their respective party conferences. David Cameron vowed to protect NHS budgets until 2020, the Lib Dems said they would considering adding a further £1billion-a-year and Labour pledged an extra £2.5billion - although it later emerged that money would not be available in their first year of government. The British Medical Association and the Royal College of GPs, among others, have said a funding crisis threatens the core tenet of the public health service being free at the point of access. They cautioned: 'Savings have been made, and despite the best efforts of nurses, doctors and other staff, patients have not been insulated from these cuts. 'Too many staff feel undervalued and demoralised when all they want is to be able to care for patients. Rob Webster (left), of the confederation which represents NHS commissioners and providers, said hospitals could start charging for 'bed and board' after former health minister Lord Warner (right)  previously warned that the NHS is 'unaffordable', 'out-of-date' and unable to meet the needs of the population . 'The NHS and our social care services are at breaking point and things cannot go on like this. An NHS deficit of £30 billion is predicted by 2020 - a funding black hole that must be filled. 'While we welcome the fact that the NHS has risen to the top of the political agenda, and some new spending commitments have been made, we need a comprehensive, fully costed, long-term spending plan if an NHS true to its founding principles of universal healthcare, provided according to need not ability to pay, is secured for future generations.' It comes after former Labour health minister, Lord Warner, warned that the NHS was 'unaffordable', 'out-of-date' and unable to meet the needs of the population. In July, he said everyone should pay a £10-a-month fee to use the NHS, and he called for the levy to be paid before anyone could benefit from free treatment. He said the controversial measures would prevent a financial crisis in the health service, which is struggling to meet the needs of the increasingly ageing, unhealthy population. Members of the Royal College of Nursing also called for patients to pay up to £10 to see their family doctor to generate vital NHS funding while also deterring patients from making appointments and then failing to show up, but later voted against it. The NHS's annual budget currently stands at £114billion, up by more than £12.7billion on 2010. But bosses claim that, once inflation is taken into account, that works out at less than a 0.1 per cent annual increase. The NHS started in July 1948 to eradicate one of the five 'giants evils' identified by economist William Beveridge - 'want, disease, squalor, ignorance, idleness'. Health secretary Aneurin Bevan, the creator of the service, designed it to bring hospitals, pharmacists, opticians and dentists together under one organisation that would be free for all. Charges have since been brought in for prescriptions and dental procedures but medical treatment at doctors' surgeries and in hospitals has always been free – including overnight stays. From its beginning the health service has struggled to stay within budget, and the money set aside for free glasses for the organisation's first nine months was used up in just six weeks. Original estimates were that the service would cost taxpayers £140million a year by 1950, but its budget for that year was in fact £358million. Economists say the price of healthcare rises faster than the rate of inflation because of the spiraling costs of new drugs and the effects of  Britain's aging population and growing obesity problems. In the last ten years, NHS funding has risen from around £1,300 per person in England to more than £1,979 per person. Statistics released last year reveal the health service employs nearly 150,000 doctors, around 400,000 nurses, 150,000 scientists and more than 35,000 managers. Last year saw a rise in the number of staff by around 18,000, with the top performing trusts spending an extra £1.2billion, £660million more than planned. Chiefs had hoped to cut budgets by treating more patients in the community rather than in hospitals, but figures show emergency admissions and outpatient appointments have both risen. Hospitals are said to be running over budget to avoid a scandal like that at Stafford Hospital, where police investigated more than 300 deaths said to be due neglect or poor care.","Senior NHS source claims suggested fee could be set at about £75 per night .

"An elderly New York drug dealer who  jumped bail and fled from one of upstate New York’s biggest drug cases has been caught in Oregon after 20 years on the run. John Franklin Forbis, 72, was arrested on Thursday at his home on Deadwood Road west of Eugene in the Coast Range, Sergeant Carrie Carver of the Lane County sheriff’s office said. The elderly fugitive was caught after he  fell ill and applied for Social Security benefits using his true identity, according to the sheriff's office. Arrested: John Franklin Forbis, 72, was arrested on Thursday at his home on Deadwood Road west of Eugene in the Coast Range . Forbis appeared bald and grizzled after Lane County Sheriff’s Office caught the 72-year-old on the edge of the coastal Siuslaw National Forest where he’s been hiding out under a pseudonym. But in his younger days, he had  specialized in making marijuana-infused rum. In 1992, he vanished  from Hudson, New York after saying that he planned to flee to Turkey. Columbia County District Attorney Paul Czajka told the Daily News: 'He was the only defendant that I could remember essentially losing.' A judge's denial of Czajka’s request of a $2 million bail led to Forbis' escape. He posted part of his $150,000 bail shortly after New York State Police caught him with $1 million worth of marijuana which was hidden in a storage shed. That amount of pot would be worth more than $1.6 million today with the rate of inflation factored in.

Rum: Forbis, 72,  had specialized in making marijuana-infused rum in his younger days . At the time police raided his property they found 850 pounds of marijuana in trash bags which were thought to have come from  the Gallatin area, Czajka added. Even though he wasn’t in the courtroom, a jury in Columbia County, New York, convicted Forbis in 1992 of a drug charge. He was found guilty of first-degree possession of marijuana, a Class A felony, and convicted  to five to 15 years in prison. In 2012, the case was reopened. 'It’s the biggest pot case we’ve ever had' Czajka said. Forbis is due to be extradited back to New York and  taken to the Department of Corrections where he will finally serve his sentence.","John Franklin Forbis, 72, was arrested on Thursday at his home .

"A former magistrate who fractionally strayed over the white lines of a parking bay has condemned the 'petty' £75 fine he was given. Ron Wotherspoon, 65, found the ticket on his Mercedes Benz A-Class car after he left it marginally in a hatched area at a country train station. He claims he was forced to park slightly outside of the bay as a neighbouring Range Rover had left him with no room to get out of his car. 'Petty' fine: Ron Wotherspoon said he was forced to park outside the lines by a neighbouring Range Rover . He said he was not blocking any vehicles or exits and said the £75 penalty was 'petty'. Mr Wotherspoon said: 'While I am the first to criticise people who park badly in car parks, on this occasion the cross-hatched area was not on a right of way or emergency access. 'I could not see how I would be doing anything other than making use of a bay that would have otherwise been unusable. 'As can be seen the area is in front of a lamp post and I left plenty of access to that. 'It's just petty. It's not a good way to encourage people to respect the action they take.' Mr Wotherspoon, a business mentor from Cambridge, found himself booked at Audley End station in the village of Wendens Ambo, Essex. He successfully appealed against the penalty and car park operators have cancelled the fine. Ron Wotherspoon said parking fines for infractions like his don't encourage people to 'respect their actions' An NCP spokesman said: 'Our colleagues on the ground have the very clear brief that all cars parked outside of the bay lines must receive a penalty notice. 'The appeals process allows the management team to review the image provided when the offence has taken place and gives us a second opportunity to assess each situation on a case by case basis. 'With this in mind we have reviewed the image and are happy to cancel this penalty notice as a gesture of goodwill.'","Ron Wotherspoon said nearby Range Rover forced him to park wide .

"Fraud: The late Shinichi Suzuki, founder of the Suzuki method, has been lying about his training . A legendary music teacher behind a world-renowned method has been accused of being a fraud and lying about befriending Albert Einstein. Shinichi Suzuki, founder of the Suzuki method which has been used by millions, claimed he spent eight years studying in Germany and cited Einstein as his 'guardian'. It has now emerged that the Japanese musician was rejected from the prestigious Berlin music school at auditions, and only met Einstein once to sell him a violin. The Suzuki method has taught millions of children since it was launched by the Japanese violinist in the late 1950s. It sees children start playing an instrument as young as possible, preferably around the age of three, and learn by playing the same short pieces repeatedly from memory. To back up his credibility as a teacher Suzuki, who died in 1998 at the age of 99, claimed he spent eight years as a private student of Karl Klinger, a leading violinist and professor at Berlin Hochshule, in the 1920s, during which time he says he befriended Einstein. However a number of critics are now presenting evidence that Suzuki lied about his training and background, accusing him of being a fraud. The most recent includes proof that Suzuki, the son of a violin maker, was rejected by Klinger and the Berlin Hochshule when he auditioned there in 1923, aged 24. 'I think it is one of the biggest frauds in music history,' Mark O'Connor, a U.S. violin teacher and composer told The Telegraph. 'I don't believe anybody has properly checked his past.' Mr O'Connor has posted the list of auditions from the German music school on his blog, which includes Suzuki's and proves that he failed to get in and was never taught by Klinger. 'Shinichi Suzuki had no violin training from any serious violin teacher that we can find,' O'Connor writes on his blog. Scroll down for video . Fake credentials: Shinichi Suzuki,  pictured teaching Jimmy Carter's daughter Amy to play during a visit to the White House in 1979, never studied in Berlin and no evidence can be found that he had any training at all . 'He was basically self-taught, beginning the violin at the age of 18, and it showed. He was never allowed a position in any orchestra, never performed professionally or made a professional recording.' In Suzuki's biographies it is claimed that he was Klinger's 'only private pupil' from 1921, two years before he auditioned for the school. Mr O'Connor, himself the founder of a teaching method, claims Suzuki lied to be able to sell his training method around the globe. 'Looking at this single line entry of Shinichi Suzuki - we have a 24 year-old man who was not good enough to get lessons at this music conservatory with any professor there including Karl Klingler, and therefore did not seek violin training at the end of the day.' Although Suzuki himself once claimed he befriended Albert Einstein, a keen amateur violin player, and was under his 'guardianship' while in Berlin, there is no evidence of this, Mr O'Connor says, other than that Suzuki once delivered one of his father's violins to him. Following publication of this article, we were contacted by the International Suzuki Association and the British Suzuki Institute, who supplied the following statement prepared by the International Suzuki Association Board of Directors: . Shinichi Suzuki had violin lessons with the prominent German violinist Karl Klingler in Berlin in the 1920’s. Klingler’s daughter, Marianne Klingler, was a strong supporter of Suzuki’s teaching principles and became the first chairperson of the European Suzuki Association. Ms. Klingler confirmed many times that Suzuki had indeed studied with her father. Many honorary doctorates and awards were bestowed upon Shinichi Suzuki during his lifetime. Some of these include: Honorary Doctor of Music, New England Conservatory of Music (1966), Honorary Doctor of Music, University of Louisville (1967), Ysaye Award from Eugene Ysaye Foundatiion (1969), Order of the Rising Sun, Third Class (circa 1970), Honorary Doctor of Music, University of Rochester Eastman School of Music (1972), 6th Moil Music Award from Japan (1976), Honorary Distinguished Professor, North East Louisiana University (1982), PALMES ACADEIQUES from France (1982), Japan Foundation Award (1983), Honorary Doctor of Music, Oberlin College Conservatory of Music (1984), Bundesverdienstkreuz 1.Klasse from West Germany (1985), Venezia Award from Italy's Venezia Award Society (1985), Honorary Doctor of Music, Cleveland Institute of Music (1990), Honorary Doctor of Music, University of St. Andrews, Scotland (1990). Throughout his professional life, Shinichi Suzuki was open to new ideas and development in teaching aimed at improving the learning environment for children studying how to play a musical instrument. He strongly encouraged teachers to develop new ideas and share their ideas with one another. This continues to be central to Suzuki teaching throughout the world, implemented by the many teachers who today apply Suzuki’s teaching principles. In the end, however, it is not what Shinichi Suzuki did or did not do in the 1920s that is of importance. The important issue is the successful use of his teaching principles which have enriched the lives of students and has positively influenced music education worldwide for the past 70 years.","Millions have been taught to play the violin using the Suzuki method .

"The murder charge against AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd has been dropped, the Tauranga Crown Solicitor has confirmed. Rudd's lawyer Paul Mabey QC said Crown Solicitor Greg Hollister-Jones had made his decision because there was insufficient evidence to justify the charge. 'The charge alleging an Attempt to Procure Murder should never have been laid. The Crown Solicitor's opinion was not sought,' Mr Mabey said in a statement. 'The charge is now withdrawn - within 24 hours of Mr Rudd's first appearance in court.' On Thursday, the 60-year-old musician was charged with attempting to procure murder, threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis and appeared in court following a police raid on his North Island home in New Zealand. Scroll down for video . Phil Rudd appeared outside his Tauranga house and swore at the media as the news broke that he had been charged with threatening to kill and possession of methamphetamine and cannabis . AC/DC drummer Phil Rudd pictured stepping out of a police car without shoes on Thursday . Rudd's lawyer Paul Mabey QC said Crown Solicitor Greg Hollister-Jones had withdrawn the 'attemping to procure murder' charge because there was insufficient evidence . Mr Mabey said he would defend the threatening to kill charge and that the drugs charges were 'minor'. Mr Mabey added that Rudd had 'suffered unnecessary and extremely damaging publicity as a result of widespread and sensational reporting of a very serious allegation, which on any basis was never justified'. If found guilty of threatening to kill, Rudd could face a maximum seven-year prison sentence, The New Zealand Herald reported. He will reappear in court on November 27. Earlier, the man allegedly hired as a hitman by Rudd said he was asked to become his bodyguard after the rocker said he was threatened for not paying 'working girls'. The alleged hitman, whose name has been suppressed, told The Sydney Morning Herald in an exclusive interview, that Rudd was the 'Hugh Hefner of Tauranga' claiming that the amount he spent on 'company is like someone's yearly wage'. The man told Fairfax Media: 'The girls that he gets, working girls and that, they're p***ed off, he tells them ""Nah I'm not paying you"" and then the partners come and say they want their money.' Rudd allegedly attempted to hire a hitman to kill two people, a court heard. One charge was later dropped . Security stand guard outside of Rudd's house in Tauranga on the North Island in New Zealand . The Daily Telegraph reported that the man went on fishing and helicopter trips with Rudd who also allowed him to drive his flashy sports cars. He added that although Rudd was burning his bridges with those 'who care about him' he was still a 'good fella' with a 'big heart'. 'You’ve got to feel sorry for him – just the expectations everyone has of him,' he said. When Daily Mail Australia contacted the band's ex-manager, Michael Browning, he had only just heard the news and said it was a 'bit of a shock, but there you go'. A statement on the band's website said: 'We've only become aware of Phil's arrest as the news was breaking. 'We have no further comment. Phil’s absence will not affect the release of our new album Rock or Bust and upcoming tour next year.' Paul Rudd pictured leaving  Tauranga District Court on Thursday afternoon . The legendary drummer also faces drug charges and received bail and will reappear in court on November 27 . The ageing rocker was silent during a brief, shoeless appearance in Tauranga District Court that afternoon and has been released on bail until his next appearance on November 27. According to court documents, Rudd is accused of attempting to hire one person to kill two others between September 25 and September 26. He is also accused of threatening to kill a complainant on September 26. Details of the complaints and the names of the alleged intended targets and hitman were suppressed by Judge Louis Bidois. At the request of defence lawyer Tony Rickard-Simms, Rudd was remanded on bail until November 27 when he will reappear in court. His bail conditions include that he lives at his Bureta home on the North Island and not contact any of the complainants.

"Most cat owners concede that their pets have a killer instinct - even if they are sometimes content to cuddle on their laps. And in a TV show set to air this evening, cat behaviour experts have examined how domestic cats are as good at hunting as lions and tigers. In fact, they claim the common moggy is more powerful and agile than its larger, more exotic cousin. Scroll down for video . In a television programme set to air on BBC Two at 9pm, cat behaviour experts examine how domestic cats are better hunters than lions and tigers. Here, Sandwich - one of the cats tagged with a GPS tracker - is pictured hunting. Sandwich has the unusual method of mimicking birdsong to tempt them down from the trees . Tonight’s episode of Horizon is the second in a three-part series called Cat Watch 2014. In the show, Dr Liz Bonnin shares the results of a large scientific study where experts have followed 100 cats fitted with GPS trackers and cameras in three urban environments. In particular, the experts looked at what makes the domestic cat a fighting machine by examining a city cat called Ozzie. In the show, Ozzie is shown battling to defend his cramped territory. The findings also reveal how farm cats hunt small prey to survive. The tracking equipment revealed that farm cats spread out across a rural area the size of 15 football pitches, including fields and wooded areas to maximise their chances of catching prey. Unlike pampered cat that typically play with mice – because they do not need to eat prey to survive – the farm cats can kill a mouse in two seconds flat. Experts at the Royal Veterinary College placed sensors on a cat’s joints and analysed the pressure exerted by its paws with a special floor pad, to reveal that cats rarely straighten their legs when prowling. Experts at the Royal Veterinary College placed sensors on a pet cat’s joints and analysed the pressure exerted by its paws with a special floor pad, to reveal that cats rarely straighten their legs when prowling - just like a tiger (pictured). One cat specialist said their hunting methods were 'almost indistinguishable' They are almost always in a crouched posture, even when they run at full speed. Professor John Huntington explained that this position is why the cats are so agile and stealthy. He said domestic cats’ posture is ‘almost indistinguishable’ from that of a big cat. Domestic cats can jump almost five times their height and are incredibly flexible. This action has recently been captured on X-ray. It shows the fluid way the skeleton moves to give cats the perfect poise. One expert said that pound-for-pound, domestic cats are just as powerful as big cats - if not more so - and thanks to their flexibility they are in some ways better athletes. Rob the cat is pictured . Domestic cats can jump almost five times their height and are incredibly flexible. This action has recently been captured on X-ray. Here, a European wildcat snatches a bird in mid-air with its mouth . The programme shows how cats unleash more power than a racehorse and what happens millisenonds before they pounce. Cats first move their ears to locate their target and their pupils dilate seconds before they pounce, showing their heightened sensitivity and state of arousal. Their hind quarters also shake, which is perhaps to warm up their muscles. Pound for pound, domestic cats are just as powerful as big cats – if not more so - and thanks to their flexibility they are in some ways better athletes, he said. Domestic cats have retained their hunting instinct, even though most don’t have a need to hunt because they are fed at regular intervals by their owners. The programme shows that the village and city cats tracked with GPS collars still hunt in nearby woods, and bring home kills at least four times a week, including large birds such as seagulls. Sandwich, a village cat, is filmed mimicking the sounds of birds as an attempt to lure her prey down. Cat behaviour Dr Sarah Ellis, of the University of Lincoln, said that cats locate the prey, capture it, kill it and them shake the animal to loosen muscles before consuming it. But well-fed house cats play with prey before killing it because they are not dependent on the nutrients to survive, but they are still satisfying their hunting instinct.

On the farm, a tortoiseshell mother is shown fighting to retain a hunted dinner to survive. Cats can’t survive on plant protein and are locked into eating meat. They don’t waste any of a carcass in the wild, and crunch the bones for nutrients. They get most of their water from the meat, too. This hunting behaviour is present in all members of the cat family from tigers to tabbies. Because cat food now contains all essential nutrients, it is possible for cats to diminish their hunting instinct as their needs are catered to more and more, she said.

"An American man caught with almost 3kg of methamphetamine at Perth Airport has been found not guilty of drug smuggling. Robert Dewey Henson was arrested on November 7 last year after custom officials found the drugs hidden in the lining of a suitcase in his possession. The West Australian Supreme Court heard last week that Mr Henson had been tricked into smuggling the border controlled substance by purported British lawyer 'Roland Blair'. An American man has been found not guilty of drug smuggling after he was caught with almost 3kg of methamphetamine at Perth Airport . Mr Blair had emailed Mr Henson two years prior to the incident, claiming he was entitled to a $10.5 million inheritance but needed to courier packages to receive it. The court heard that prior to arriving in Perth, Mr Henson stopped over in Manila of the Philippines where he met 'Jana', who allegedly asked him to carry a suitcase of her personal belongings on the trip. Mr Henson claimed to have checked the suitcase but not the lining where the drugs were hidden. Robert Dewey Henson was arrested on November 7 last year after custom officials found the drugs hidden in the lining of a suitcase in his possession . He also said he knew someone would collect the suitcases at some time in Perth and he would be paid $1000. But despite his suspicions that he was being scammed, Mr Henson kept going because he was happy to travel. The street value of the methamphetamine was between $1.2 million and $4.3 million. After his trial, the jury rejected prosecutor Linda Black's argument Mr Henson would not have been trusted with such a valuable package without knowing what he was carrying. Defence lawyer Henry Sklarz had argued Mr Henson was groomed by Mr Blair and never intended to import drugs.","An American man has been found not guilty of drug smuggling .

"Leaker Edward Snowden says the US government failed to keep track of the Boston bombing suspects . National Security Agency leaker Edward Snowden says the Boston Marathon bombings are an example of how threats can be missed even under blanket surveillance. Snowden, who leaked millions of documents to journalists, talked to Harvard Law professor Lawrence Lessig on Monday online from Russia, where he is in exile. 'The reality is that we knew who these guys were and who they were associating with — but we didn't follow up or watch these guys,' he said, according to the Boston Globe. Snowden added that he comes from a family that believe 'fundamentally the government had noble aims and that it did good things.’' 'But what I was not aware of and have grown aware of, while the people in government largely are there for the right reasons, there is a culture that pervades the upper levels, the senior levels that has become less accountable to the public they serve,' he said, according to the Globe.

"Admit it, some days you just don't feel like going to work. And when those days come, whether we'd like to admit it or not, we call in sick -- even when we're not sick at all. The art of 'playing hooky' is a great way to get out of a day at the office, but with that comes one challenge: coming up with a credible excuse. And a survey for the online career site Careerbuilder.com has revealed that people have gotten creative, I mean really creative. The survey, carried out by Harris Poll, sampled more than 3,000 U.S. workers from Aug. 11 to Sept. 5  looking at how many of them faked being sick this year as well as their excuses for doing so. Creative: A survey commission by Careerbuilder.com and carried out by Harris Poll found that 28 percent of employees surveyed have faked being sick to get out of going to work (stock photo) The survey found that 28 percent of employees have called in to work sick over the past year when they were feeling fine, down 4 percent from last year. The excuses workers reportedly gave when taking a sick day ranged from one employee failing to come in to work because they 'just put a casserole in the oven' to another claiming they 'caught their uniform on fire by putting it in the microwave to dry.' But wait, there's more. Employers also reported hearing from employees that they couldn't come in to work because they 'accidently got on a plane' or 'had a lucky night and didn’t know where he was.' One employee also reportedly took the day off because their plastic surgery needed some 'tweaking.' The survey found that though 49 percent of the employees surveyed said they have Paid Time Programs which allows them to use their 'sick days' or 'vacation days' however they please, many felt obligated to give a reason for their absence -- even if that reason is a lie. Relax: Of those surveyed, 30 percent admitted that they simply did not feel like going to work and 29 percent said they called in sick because they just 'wanted to relax' (stock photo) Thirty percent admitted that they simply did not feel like going to work and 29 percent said they called in sick because they just 'wanted to relax.' A phone call and a good excuse isn't the end of the line for playing hooky anymore, 31 percent of the employers surveyed said they checked up on these 'sick' employees. Some employers said they've required doctor's notes from their employees, some called the employees, and others even drove past the home of the absent workers, according to Careerbuilder. In some cases, employers don't even have to investigate, the employees unknowingly rat themselves out. One in four employers said that they've caught employees who have lied about being sick by simply checking social media. Although some of these employers have fired the employees, more than half said they only reprimanded the employee for lying. Not all of the employees were 'playing hooky' though, 21 percent said they took the day off to actually attend a doctor's appointment. But the survey reports that 19 percent just wanted to catch up on sleep. The survey reports that employee absences seem to peak during the winter months with 11 percent of employees taking the day off due to bad weather or to spend time with friends and family during the holiday season. Despite the winter weather, phony excuses, and lethargy, the amount of employees that have called in sick has gone down. CNN reports that many refuse to call in sick because of the responsibilty of their work or because they can't afford to lose a day's pay. The survey found that employees in the IT, Hospitality, and Retail and Leisure industries were least likely to call in sick with percentages between 20 and 22. The survey sampled 3,103 workers and 2,203 human resouce professionals and hiring managers across various industries. The workers surveryed were fulltime, non-governent, and non self-employed U.S. employees.","A survey for online career site Careerbuilder.com has revealed that 28 percent of employees played hooky in the past year .

"Ten senior members of North Korea’s ruling party have been executed after they were caught watching soap operas. The officials were killed on the order of dictator Kim Jong-Un, taking the number of senior government and military members executed this year to 50, South Korea's intelligence agency have said. The ten were ‘executed by firing squad for watching South Korean soap operas, bribery or womanising’. Scroll down for video .

Pirate copies of South Korean and Chinese television programmes are widely available and traded on the black market, The Telegraph reports. Details on the executions were provided by the intelligence service in a report to the South Korean parliament on Tuesday, Yonhap News told the paper.

No time for fun for you, only me: Ten officials have been executed for watching South Korean soap operas . Last week, South Korean media reported that six officials - including the minister of mail and telecommunications, the commanding officer of North Korea's air force and a key official in the North's sport programmes - have not been present at a series of important events in recent months. An intelligence source told South Korea's renowned JoongAng Ilbo newspaper that 'six minister-level officials were executed'. If true, it would be the third major purge since the dictator Kim Jong-un assumed power in 2011. This comes a day after North Korea held talks with a UN human rights investigator for first the first time in ten years. The women's football game took place just weeks after a key official for 'sport programmes' went missing .

UN human rights chief Marzuki Darusman said he was surprised and gratified that North Korean officials had raised the possibility of allowing him to visit their country during their meeting. But he said the prospect of such a trip remains deeply uncertain because leader Kim Jong Un was insisting that he drop moves in a UN resolution to prosecute the country at the International Criminal Court.over its human rights record. A U.N. Commission of Inquiry report, published in February, detailed wide-ranging abuses, including the use of prison camps, torture, starvation and killings comparable to Nazi-era atrocities.","Kim Jong-Un said to have executed ten officials for watching soaps .

"The husband of the late Lisa Flynt-Fugate, the daughter of controversial Hustler publisher Larry Flynt who died recently after a car crash, has accused an unnamed family member of stealing three golden eggs that belonged to his wife. Glen Fugate called the police to his home in Dayton, Ohio, on Friday to investigate the theft of the eggs, valued at $2,000 each . Fugate told police that he believes one of sister-in-laws took the valued possessions while she was helping his mother-in-law Amanda Carson move out of the home. According to the police report, Fugate said he saw the unnamed sister remove the items from his wife’s glass display shelf. Fugate said he told the relative to put the eggs back and she did, but later he noticed that the eggs were again missing from the display. The sister denies taking the eggs. ‘It could have easily been one of the several family and friends that were in the house’ she told the cops when interviewed. Fugate has said he won’t press charges if the eggs are returned to him. Flynt-Fugate, 47, suffered critical injuries in an October 17 car crash and died seven days later after she was removed from life support . Flynt-Fugate had seven siblings - Tammy Carson, John (Nicole) Carson, Tonya Flynt, Kim Carson, Theresa Flynt, Ray (Rory) Carson, and Larry Flynt Jr plus six children of her own. Aged 47, she suffered critical injuries in an October 17 car crash. Flynt had left a local bar with 24-year-old friend Cierra Mallory before 5pm when she swerved in front of a semitrailer and rolled her Oldsmobile on Valley Pike in Riverside. The Huber Heights resident was ejected from the vehicle in the crash, and rushed to Miami Valley Hospital in Dayton. She was put on life-support but succumbed to her injuries after she was removed from life support seven days later on October 24 . Two  police officers stand near Flynt-Fugate's crashed Oldsmobile sedan, she was driving away from a bar at the time of the crash . Her father, Hustler publisher Larry Flynt, was on the phone with family at the hospital at the time of Lisa’s passing. Flynt Sr, 71, is the publisher of Hustler and the chairman of a large adult entertainment empire. He is best known for being part of the landmark Supreme Court Case Hustler Magazine v. Falwell. Flynt's magazine was sued by Evangelist Jerry Falwell after they published an ad which joked about the first time Falwell had sex. Falwell tried suing the magazine, but the Supreme Court ruled that since he was a famous person, he couldn't receive damages for emotional distress - strengthening the First Amendment right to free speech. The story about the infamous legal battle was turned into a movie called The People vs. Larry Flynt, starring Woody Harrelson as the pornographer.","Lisa Flynt-Fugate, 47, died last month a week after crashing her car .

"Blue light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been receiving positive attention after its inventors were awarded the Nobel Prize in physics last week. They use around 90 per cent less energy than incandescent bulbs and last for 100,000 hours compared with  1,000 hours for tungsten filament light bulbs. But while they may be good for the environment, a new study claims that the discovery may a problem for insects, which are more strongly attracted to the LED spectrum of light. Scroll down for video . While blue LEDs may be good for the environment, a new study claims that the discovery may a problem for insects, which are more strongly attracted to the LED spectrum of light . The research, by New Zealand-based institute Scion, found traps placed near LEDs captured 48 per cent more insects than traps near sodium-vapour lights. Sodium vapour bulbs, which emit yellow light, are commonly used in street lighting as they are more efficient than pre-LED lights. Insects are attracted to both white and yellow light, but it seems they are even more attracted to blue light which is generated by LED bulbs. Overall, the researchers caught and labelled more than 20,000 insects, with moths and flies  the most common group of bugs. They claim the attraction can be fatal, causing flies to be thrown off their usual path and into the jaws of predators, disrupting the food chain. Three Japanese-born scientists have won the Nobel Prize in physics for inventing blue-light emitting diodes (LEDs) that have revolutionised the lighting industry. Isamu Akasaki and Hiroshi Amano of Japan and U.S. scientist Shuji Nakamura won the award for their 1990s invention, which has led to the use of environmentally-friendly light sources worldwide. But when Nakamura invented the technology in 1993, the company he worked for at the time awarded him the equivalent of just £125 ($200) - despite the idea being worth a potential £50 billion ($80 billion) by 2020 according to estimates. Shuji Nakamura invented the blue light-emitting-diode while working for the Nichia Corporation in Tokushima, Japan in 1993. But when he first came up with Nichia rewarded him with just 20,000 yen (£125 or $200), as Japanese firms favoured the mentality that work for an employer was not a means for personal glory. However Nakamura quit and moved to the US in 2000, before counter-suing in 2001 after Nichia attempted to sue him for infringing trade secrets. He was ultimately awarded £5.04 million ($8.1 million) for the idea, reported as the largest payout ever made to an employee for an invention. Shuji Nakamura (left), Isamu Akasaki (centre) and Hiroshi Amano (right), all born in Japan, have won the 2014  Nobel Physics Prize, for their  environmentally-friendly blue LEDs. The lighting breakthrough creates more energy-efficient home lighting, and can improve keyhole surgery techniques . Another concern is that LED lights near ports could attract flying pests, such as the gypsy moth, that are accidentally transported by ships. 'The behavior of many animals is influenced by light in the blue portion of the spectrum. For example, insects have specific photoreceptors for blue light,' Stephen Pawson, an entomologist at the New Zealand research institute Scion, told Smithsonian. 'Thus large-scale adoption of 'white' lighting is likely to increase the impacts of nighttime lighting on all species sensitive to 'blue' light. The tests showed that simply changing the spectrum of LEDs did not reduce their attractiveness to insects. The use of LED lighting is set to increase. Estimates suggest the technology, used in everything from homes to billboards today, will be worth £50 billion ($80 billion) in 2020. The research, by New Zealand-based institute Scion, found traps placed near LEDs captured 48 per cent more insects than traps near sodium-vapour lights .

"More racist and misogynistic emails that were allegedly sent and received by Sydney University poetry and poetics professor Barry Spurr have emerged since he was suspended from work on Friday. The new emails have been leaked by online news website New Matilda in response to Mr Spurr's claims that he was quoted out of context and his defence that they had been sent during a 'whimsical linguistic game' largely to one other recipient. However the emails, which include slurs against Indigenous AFL player and Australian Of The Year recipient Adam Goodes, appear to be sent to numerous friends and colleagues of Mr Spurr over two years. 'An Aborigine, a sportsman [footballer], his mother one of the ""Stolen Generation"",' Mr Spurr allegedly wrote of Mr Goodes. 'Ticking all the correct boxes. Now all we need to know is that he suffers from 'depression' and has a disability, and he becomes the complete role model for Australians today. Scroll down for video . A number of racist and sexist emails allegedly sent by suspended University of Sydney Professor Barry Spurr have been leaked by news website New Matilda . In one email, Mr Spurr allegedly mocks Indigenous AFL player and Australian Of The Year recipient Adam Goodes by writing: 'Now all we need to know is that he suffers from 'depression' and has a disability, and he becomes the complete role model for Australians today' 'In his acceptance speech, all he talked about was racism and every time he said ""Australia"" he mispronounced it.' 'Abbott wants this so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year… to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all.' New Matilda said they released the string of edited transcripts in response to Mr Spurr's previous claims that the emails quoted him out of context. He told Fairfax last week that the exchange was a pastime 'that mocked extreme language', saying the comments were 'largely to one recipient with whom I have had a whimsical linguistic game for many years of trying to outdo one another in extreme statements'. The email continues: 'Abbott wants this [for Goodes to be titled Australian Of The Year]  so he can combine it with the inclusion of Abos in the Constitution later this year… to show that he really is a sensitive guy after all' However, New Matilda says the emails, which were allegedly sent between late 2012 and 2014, had been sent between Mr Spurr and numerous colleagues and friends. In another email referring to a woman who was sexually assaulted by a colleague who 'put his penis in her mouth' while she slept, Mr Spurr allegedly responded with 'Ye gods. I think she needs a lot put in her mouth, permanently, and then stitched up'. Two separate emails, one sent in February2013 and the other in January 2014, include the following comments from Mr Spurr's on various video links: 'no fatties, darkies or chinky-poos' and 'No Abos, Chinky-poos, Mussies, graffiti, piercings, jeans, tattoos. BCP in all Anglican chruches; Latin Mass in all Roman ones. Not a woman to be seen in a sanctuary anywhere. And no obese fatsoes' Another email allegedly shows Mr Spurr calling a house in which an Aboriginal family live 'a rubbish tip: human and material'. New Matilda disputed claims by Mr Spurr that the emails were a 'whimsical linguistic game' between himself and one recipient by releasing almost 20 of the emails that were sent between late 2012 and 2014 to numerous colleagues and friends . He wrote: '...it is now utterly destroyed, with its contents and smashed up fabric vomited out onto [a street], the pile impregnated with empty booze bottles, awaiting the Council special garbage collection for trashed housing. 'These are the people whose 'ancient wisdom', our V-C says, we should respect, and to whom we apologise on every possible occasion and whose rich culture we bow down before, confessing our wickedness in our mistreatment of them.' Another email, it is alleged Professor Spurr called the Chancellor of Sydney University as an 'appalling minx'.. Professor Spurr was employed at The University of Sydney as Personal Chair in Poetry and Poetics but was suspended by the university on Friday . The allegations against Professor Spurr, who took charge of examining nationwide English courses, came just days after results of the National Curriculum Review were released. Despite claims from the Labor party that the review is 'tainted', education minister Christopher Pyne has refused to review the new curriculum for bias, according to the ABC. However, a spokesperson for Mr Pyne told Fairfax Media: 'the minister utterly rejects and finds repugnant the denigration of any minority on the basis of their sex, race, sexual orientation or beliefs'. As part of his role in reviewing the national curriculum, Professor Spurr made the recommendation to reduce study into the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander language. Sydney University students rallied outside the city campus on Friday calling for the sacking of Professor Spurr for the racist, sexist and derogatory comments in the email exchange . In one of the emails released by New Matilda on Sunday, sent on April 19 2014, Mr Spurr is alleged to complain about being sent 300 pages to read by Mr Pyne for the completion of the review. 'And whereas the local curriculuim has the phrase 'Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander' on virtually every one of its 300 pages, the Californian curriculum does not ONCE mention native Americans and has only a very slight representation of African-American literature (which, unlike Abo literature, actually exists and has some distinguished productions),' Mr Spurr apparently wrote. '[A fellow University academic] tells me that at her grand-daughter's school – [in Sydney] - every day begins with an acknowledgement of the orignal [sic] owners of the land. No flag-raising or national anthem - just this, every day. On the school's website, it proclaims that it prides itself on its 'atheletics' [sic] program. 'If ever an education system needed a bomb under it, it's ours.' They also attached a note to the Professor's office door which dubbed him the 'professor of bigotry' Mr Spurr told the New Matilda his recommendations in the review were made with his 'considered professional view and not in any way influenced by these email exchanges which are linguistic play'. Professor Spurr said he was shocked that anyone would take the language used in the emails seriously as he always treated his students - no matter what background they are from - equally. The University of Sydney  suspended Professor  Spurr's employment on Friday after initial reports that offensive emails, including one which referred to Prime Minister Tony Abbott as an 'abo lover', had been sent from his university account. Christopher Pyne had responded to the claims and said he was disgusted by the alleged slurs but will not review the new curriculum for bias . 'Professor Spurr is suspended, effective immediately, from teaching and engaging in any other University business and is precluded from attending any University campus, while the matter is investigated and dealt with in accordance with the terms of the University’s Enterprise Agreement,' the university said in a statement. 'Racist, sexist or offensive language is not tolerated at the University of Sydney. The expectations for our staff and affiliates in respect of their professional and personal conduct are clearly set out in the University’s Code of Conduct.'

"A rare 109-year-old French steam-powered car bought by a farmer for £450 is set to fetch around £350,000 when it goes on sale. The Gardner-Serpollet 18HP Type L Phaeton Steamer was built in 1905 and still boasts its early Norwich number plate. It was bought in 1957 by George Milligen, of Stalham in Norfolk, for £450 from Suffolk harpsichord maker and steam car enthusiast, Alec Hodsdon. But when it goes up for auction at Bonhams at the end of this month, the Gardner-Serpollet is expected to go for between £340,000 and £360,000. Built in 1905, the vintage car is expected to go for between £340,000 and £360,000 at Bonhams on October 31 . Norfolk farmer George Milligen bought the Gardner-Serpollet in 1957. Pictured, Mr Milligen taking part in the famous London to Brighton run . The average weekly wage at the time was £12 and Mr Milligen, then in his late 40s, paid around £9,467 for the car in today's money. But the vintage vehicle's value has since rocketed and it went for £238,000 at Bonhams in April 2009. A Bonhams spokesman said Mr Milligen, who died in 2004, had realised it was the car, not the horse, that was the future in rural East Anglia. He said: 'The late George Milligen was no ordinary Norfolk farmer. 'Born into a privileged family, his father being a successful industrialist, George's decision to embark on a farming career was a bold one and from the outset he saw the advantages of mechanised farming at a time when the horse was still a most frequent sight on Norfolk farms. 'This foresight undoubtedly contributed to George's success in his farming career and this in turn enabled him to indulge his passion for all things mechanical, provided that they intrigued his inquisitive mind. Farmer Mr Milligen, pictured here with a vintage Vauxhall car, bought the Gardner-Serpollet for £450 in 1957 . George Milligen, pictured seated in his first family car behind his mother in the driving seat, in a 1915 6 cylinder 16hp Delage at Martello Towers, in Bournemouth . The 1905 Gardner-Serpollet 18hp Type L Phaeton Steamer was voted the historically most important car at the London to Brighton Veteran Car Run in 2010 . 'Around his East Ruston Manor Farm, at Stalham, the mildly eccentric Milligen was a familiar sight in any one of his amazing collection of early motor cars, whether at high speed at the wheel of his 1929 supercharged Mercedes-Benz SSK, tootling along in his 1909 AX Renault, or more spectacularly keeping the pressure up on one of his steam vehicles.' Nearly 60 years after Mr Milligen bought the Steamer, it's still going strong and is due to compete in the iconic London to Brighton Veteran Car Run on November 2. It was also voted the historically most important car in the event four years ago. Frenchman Léon Serpollet had invented and perfected the multi-tube flash boiler in 1888 - which made steam a more practical source of power for a car. He then began building steam automobiles under his own name in Paris from 1897. Serpollet joined forces with wealthy American industrialist Frank Gardner, who built his own petrol-engined cars between 1898 and 1900, and Gardner-Serpollet spearheaded steam car production in Europe from 1900 until 1907. In the 1902 Paris to Vienna race in, all five of the Serpollet cars entered finished the 615 mile race and in that same year Serpollet took the World Land Speed Record at just over 75mph. High quality, expert engineering, and excellent performances in competition put Gardner-Serpollet's cars at the top of the market. In 1904, the 18HP Type L model was introduced, which uses a rear-mounted boiler and a front-mounted straight-four engine, and was more in line with the current conventions of cars. Only seven Gardner-Serpollet steam cars are believed to exist. Milligen's Gardner-Serpollet is the only shaft-driven Serpollet left in existence and one of only two Type Ls in the world.","Norfolk farmer George Milligen bought Gardner-Serpollet steamer in 1957 .

"President Barack Obama will remain at the White House on both Monday and Tuesday as voters head to the polls to determine whether to oust his political party from power in the Senate. A copy of his public schedule reveals the president's plans to return to Washington, D.C. on Sunday after campaign events in Connecticut and Pennsylvania and stay there through Election Day. On Monday Obama will sit down with Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen. The following day he'll take other meetings at the White House instead of barnstorming the country, campaigning for endangered Democrats. While the president will be out of sight this week, Republicans, who have framed the off-year elections as a 'referendum' on Obama, hope he will not be out of mind. A final pre-election survey conducted by ABC News and the Washington Post shows that the second-term president's approval rating is still down in the dumps. Election forecasts now give his party a 74 percent chance of losing the Senate to Republicans. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . President Barack Obama stopped by a campaign rally for Michigan Senate candidate Gary Peters and Michigan gubernatorial candidate Mark Schauer yesterday in Detroit, Michigan. Today he'll stump for Democrats in Connecticut and Pennsylvania, but tonight he'll head back to the White House . MIA: President Obama is participating in get out the vote activities this weekend for Democrats but he'll stay out of sight at the White House on Monday and Tuesday as his party barrells toward defeat in the midterm elections . The percentage of Americans who disapprove of the job Obama's doing has stayed steady at 51 percent over the last month and a half, data released by the Post shows. His net approval rating is only slightly better than it was in early October, up from 40 percent to 43 percent. The president's inability to win over the electorate before Tuesday's elections was the overriding theme during the final round of weekend prognosticating. 'This is really the last chance for America to pass judgment on the Obama administration and on its policies,' 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace. 'And the president himself said he's not on the ballot, but his policies are - that includes hesitancy and weakness abroad, which has led to a certain degree, to the rise of ISIS. It also includes the violation of the most fundamental promise of Obamacare, to let people to keep their doctor and their insurance if they wanted to keep it. 'It's a policy of basic amnesty for those that come to the country illegally,' Romney said, pointing to Obama's promise that he would take immigration reform into his own hands before the end of the year if Congress doesn't make changes of it's own to the flawed system. Romney, a top GOP surrogate this election cycle, said his party wants to 'take a different direction.' 'We're to break the blockade in Washington by having a Republican Senate. We'll have an energy policy, which means we're gonna have the Keystone pipeline. We're going to secure the border. We're jump-start the economy,' he said, adding that the GOP would 'help get people out of poverty' and ensure 'their kids will have better schools.' Another favorite campaign buddy of Republican challengers this year, Republican Sen. Rand Paul, also cast Tuesday as a 'repudiation of the president's policies.' 'This is a referendum on the president. So no question, this is a big message to the president,' Paul told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd during an appearance on NBC. After Todd asked him if a GOP victory this week would serve as a 'mandate' in favor of Republican policies, Paul said it's a 'combination' of unhappiness with Obama and a desire to see an end to the 'gridlock' in Congress. 'It's a message that people are tired of nothing getting done,' he said. 'So I think if we win, you will see legislation passed, and you will see legislation sent to the desk of the president.' Despite Obama's efforts this weekend, Democrats are have a 74 percent chance of losing the Senate on Tuesday, forecasts show . FiveThirtyEight founder and statistician Nate Silver gave Republicans on Sunday a 73-74 percent chance of taking of winning the majority in the Senate. The Huffington Post's analysts came to roughly the same conclusion, putting the number a tick higher at 75 percent. Polling site Real Clear Politics now gives Republicans a two-seat advantage over Democrats in the Senate, though the status of eight contested races is still in flux - two of which may take additional run-off elections to decide. If key elections and Georgia and Louisiana both go to a run-off, it could be two months before the fate of the Senate is decided. Republicans may win enough competitions to take control of the Senate outright, however, regardless of what happens in either run-off scenario. Although Republicans are widely predicted to retire several of her colleagues on Tuesday, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar said Sunday morning she still has hope for her comrades. She acknowledged that the president is better liked in some areas of the country than others, then argued that Democratic Senate candidates were able to win statewide in 2012, when Obama was last on the ballot, in parts of the country that voted for Romney. 'I think a lot of that has to do with the fact that we have candidates that are independent of whatever the administration's policies are,' she told Face the Nation host Bob Schieffer. 'You certainly see them disagreeing with him on number of policy issues. 'These are moderate Democrats,' she said, who 'for the most part who have shown that kind of civility that we want in Washington.' Taking a jab at outspoken conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and his filibuster last year, she said, 'courage isn't just standing by yourself giving speech on Green Eggs and Ham. Courage is whether or not you're willing to stand next to someone you don't always agree with.' Democratic Senators fighting for their political lives this year are willing to do that, she added. Klobuchar rejected the narrative that President Obama has not stuck his neck out to save his party this year because of his own political problems. 'I think first of all we have to acknowledge that the president has helped these candidates in terms of fundraising for the Senate campaign committee,' she said. 'He's been out there. He's done a lot of work.' President Obama will not be out there, standing arm in arm with his party, win or lose, on Tuesday, however. In fact, if Democrats do keep control of the Senate, Obama won't be around to celebrate their success when they triumphantly return to Washington, D.C. The president will embark on a trip to China next Sunday evening and won't return for nine days. Congress, on the other hand, is schedule to reconvene next Wednesday. Political parties traditionally hold new member orientation that week, as well, to help the newest additions of the rank and file get settled in before they take the oath of office in January. Because of his trip, Obama will not be on hand to meet and greet new Democratic lawmakers if and when they first arrive.","Obama will take meetings in Washington, D.C. on Monday and Tuesday instead of barnstorming the country for his political party .

"This is the dramatic moment tourists on a safari stood their ground against a charging African Bull Elephant. Rather than flee, these hikers at Kruger National Park in South Africa put aside their fears and faced down the raging mammal after they stumbled upon the creature in the bush. And the onlookers kept their cool while one of the tourists captured the moment on a video camera when the beast squared-up to the group. A tour guide gets ready to aim his weapon at the beast as it took a run at the group with the tourists looking on . The elephant then let out a roar while a guide aimed a rifle at its head to presumably keep the holidaymaker group from running away into the wild. After, the Bull Elephant - which can weigh up to 5.5 tons - turned away in the stand-off over a number of seconds, and the amateur filmmaker can be heard whispering: 'Everyone's able to breathe now.' Cornel Rademeyer, the group's walking safari guide, in a supposed respect for the raging mammal, said to the tour group: 'We don't hunt elephants – he came to us.' After the animal squared-off and beat back into the bush, the tourists can be later seen smiling and breathing a sigh of relief at the frightening moment which put them in a head-to-head with the beast. Luckily for all involved they walked away with their lives and have the terrifying moment on film to look back on in the years ahead. Now the safari leader points and aims his rifle as the raging mammal roars as it gets closer to the vacationers . Earlier, the onlookers in the park had  been watching the African Bull Elephant from a safe distance in the bush . And unlike most tourists who come away from safaris with only snaps from wild animals at a distance, this group have a video to show their family and friends that show they got 'the real' experience. But German tourists last year at Kruger National Park had a more violent stand-off with an elephant. The rampaging mammal reacted with fury to a car the group was travelling in. The wild beast stormed on to the dust track the holidaymakers were driving on and charged straight at their vehicle. Here the tour groups laughs and smiles and enjoy looking at each other's photos from the hair-raising moment . Video footage captured the moment the five-tonne bull elephant smashed its way in to the car using only one of its dagger-sharp tusks. Wildlife watchers inside the vehicle yelled 'Drive, drive, drive!' and fled the elephant, which had just fought off a rival at Kruger National Park in South Africa. A young boy among the tourists smiles as the coast is clear and the wild beast has headed back to the bush . One of the Germans quipped as they sped away: 'I think we lost the deposit.' Nobody was injured in the incident, despite broken glass showering the interior of the vehicle. Bull elephants have tusks up to 5ft long which are often used for goring rivals in battles for supremacy of Africa's vast plains and savannahs. Male elephants grow up to 13ft in height and often over females.","Raging mammal approached group in Kruger National Park in South Africa .

"Jailed: Melissa Reid will appear in a TV campaign to warm about the risks of drug smuggling . Drug mule Melissa Reid is set to be the face of a national television campaign to warn young people against getting caught up in crime abroad. The Foreign and Commonwealth Office is joining forces with the 21-year-old Scot’s family to highlight the risks of smuggling illegal substances, The Mail on Sunday can reveal. Miss Reid’s story will be used as a cautionary tale as part of the multi-million pound nationwide campaign to be launched next month. It will include hardhitting billboard posters, TV and cinema adverts, as well as Facebook and Twitter. Miss Reid, from Lenzie, Dunbartonshire, was convicted of trying to smuggle £1.5 million of cocaine out of Peru in August last year with Michaella McCollum, 20, from County Tyrone. The pair had been staying on the holiday island of Ibiza when they became involved with a drug cartel and travelled to Lima, where they were caught with the Class A drug in their suitcases. They were jailed there in December for eight years each, reduced to six years and eight months because of their guilty pleas. Miss Reid is waiting to transfer to a prison in her home country. Last week Miss Reid’s father Billy said he was unable to comment on his involvement in the FCO campaign. However the 54-year-old told The Mail on Sunday earlier this year of his plans to visit airports to speak to young travellers face-to-face, saying: ‘I have to do something – I can’t sit at home knowing vulnerable teenagers are heading to these destinations unaware they may be targeted. ‘Young people need to know there may be people out there actively looking to recruit and entrap them. When you’re on holiday your guard is down.’ According to the 2014 British Behaviour Abroad report, drug arrests involving British nationals abroad rose by six per cent to more than 700 last year. The FCO said: ‘The focus of the campaign is to reduce the number of drug related consular cases and raise awareness of the risks.’","Her story will be used to highlight risks of getting involved in crime abroad .

"Kevin O'Connell was killed on Saturday after he was hit by a car when he tried to intervene in a fight . A Good Samaritan was run over and killed in front of his children after he stepped in to help when an argument broke out on the streets. Father-of-three Kevin O'Connell pulled over while driving to step in and help the victim of an alleged assault when he gave chase and was hit by a car in Derby. Witnesses said one of the 33-year-old's daughters, who was waiting in the car with her two siblings, called for an ambulance following the incident at around 1pm on Saturday. Derbyshire Police said Mr O'Connell was hit by a passing car when he tried to intervene in a fight between two men. East Midlands Ambulance service said he was taken to the Royal Derby Hospital, but were unable to confirm whether he died on arrival. Sergeant Darren Muggleton, who is investigating the incident, said: 'We are in the early stages of the investigation but it appears that Mr O'Connell had stopped his car to try to break up a disagreement between two men. 'One man ran off and Mr O'Connell was chasing him when he fell into the path of a car that was passing. This tragic incident was witnessed by his three children. He died a hero trying to help a member of the public he thought was being victimised.' Two men, aged 27 and 34, who were involved in the argument were arrested on suspicion of assault on each other and were bailed after being questioned. The driver of the car was not arrested but was spoken to by officers at the scene. A woman who lived close to where the crash happened told how she was alerted to the tragedy by someone screaming. She said: 'It was a terrible accident. We could hear screaming outside and knew something was wrong from that. 'I was crying and upset. I think of the poor kids - this will stay with them for the rest of their lives. 'I walked to help them because it is just natural. You do feel a little useless afterwards, but we could not have done more. 'He must have been a special person to pull over and he obviously had something about him. If I saw what he saw, I don't know if I would get out of my car. It takes guts. He stopped his car to help and is a hero. I'm sure he was a genuinely nice guy.' The incident happened on Burton Road in Derby close to the Car Parts Direct store on Saturday afternoon . Family friend Tracey Bricknell, 50, from Findern in Derby, said: 'My heart and thoughts go out to all the family. It is a tragic accident - Kevin was loved by everybody. He was very friendly and outgoing and has been taken too young. 'He has a very strong family unit, they are all together. His mum talks about the family all the time. 'They are a lovely and down-to-earth family and I know the funeral will be huge, absolutely huge.' Social media was flooded with messages paying tribute to Mr O'Connell. Martin Edwards wrote: 'RIP Kev. My heart goes out to all your family. Never forgotten.' Richard Yeomans added: 'My thoughts go out to you and your family. I'm really sorry to hear about it.' The father-of-three has been described by family friends as a 'hero' who was 'very friendly and outgoing' Gary Woolley wrote: 'What can one say? A fantastic lad, a fantastic family. 'I just cannot believe it. My thoughts are with you all. God bless you all.' Officers have spoken to several witnesses and are conducting house to house enquiries to gather information about exactly what happened. Witnesses or anyone else with information about the incident have been asked to contact Derbyshire Police.","Kevin O'Connell pulled over while driving after seeing a fight break out .

"Authorities say the first known fatal bear attack in New Jersey was unprovoked and the bear was acting in a 'predatory' manner. Officials attribute the death of a 22-year-old Rutgers University student from Edison to 'mauling.' Darsh Patel was hiking with four friends in the Apshawa Preserve last month when they noticed the bear following them. Scroll down for video... Unprovoked: Darsh Patel, 22, is confirmed as the first person in New Jersey history to be killed by a bear, according to authorities (file photo) Attacks: Northern New Jersey locals captured this black bear looking for food in their garbage in September. Just a day after the footage was shot,  a black bear mauled a 22-year-old student to death in the woods nearby . Locals: Residents in northern New Jersey often spot bears in and around their yards. There are as many 2,400 bruins in the area's dense forests, but until now had never been a fatal human-bear attack . The group scattered, and Patel's friends, who were not injured, called police when they realized he was missing. A search team found Patel's body, which showed signs of a bear attack. His body sustained numerous bites and claw marks..A nearby bear was later destroyed. West Milford police and the Environmental Protection Department issued a statement saying the bear did not seem interested in food. Officials said the bear exhibited 'stalking type behavior. When authorities found the bear, it was about 30 yards from the body and circling, Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said. It wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones. Mr Patel is confirmed as the first person in New Jersey history to be killed by a bear, according to authorities. At the time, locals believed they had filmed the same black bear hunting for food hours before Mr Patel was mauled to death in nearby woods. Preserve: The Apshawa Preserve is a 526-acre park with hiking trails . Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food. State and local officials stressed that bear attacks are rare even in a region of the state that may have as many as 2,400 bruins in its dense forests. 'This is a rare occurrence,' West Milford police Chief Timothy Storbeck said, noting that his department receives six to 12 calls per week regarding bears, usually involving them breaking into trash cans. Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run. The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said. New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.' Idyllic: The wooded preserve provides hiking trails and a peaceful setting for visitors to the northern New Jersey site . 'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesman for the Department of Environmental Protection. 'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they're obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.' Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted. In 2006, a tabby cat scared a black bear up a tree in West Milford. The bear only climbed down and left after the cat's owner had called it back into the house.","Darsh Patel, 22, was hiking with friends in the Apshawa Preserve in West Milford in September when a bear started following them .

"The man behind a hoax phone call, impersonating Aussie rapper 360 in an interview with 3AW has been confirmed as 'battle rapper' BK Ultra. Talkback host Tom Elliott, whose integrity was questioned on social media over the incident, was led to believe he was talking to 360 on his radio show on Monday, but instead was being pranked. 360 filmed himself listening to the impersonator be interviewed and then posted the footage on his Facebook page. It is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August.

Elliott admits on Twitter that he finally realised he was not speaking with the real 360 . This is the second time Elliott has been caught with egg on his face after a Kurdish man, living in Scandinavia, pretended to be ISIS commander Omar al-Shishani during a phone interview in August . Speaking to music blog Project U, BK Ultra confirmed he was the prankster behind the call, who spoke for several minutes  before Elliott's team cottoned on. The Melbourne radio host thought he was talking to 360 about his controversial remarks on ABC TV show Q & A on October 20 where he said he identified the Australian flag with racism. 360, whose real name is Matt Colwell, took great delight in filming himself listening to the show where the impersonator told Elliott that he had joined the Illuminati – an historical secret society. ‘I was inducted because I am enlightened,’ the caller said when Elliott questioned that calling himself enlightened being was racist. ‘It has nothing to (do with) race it’s a mind frame,’ the fake 360 said. The conversation then became even more bizarre when the prankster declared himself as a unicorn. ‘Who are you to say I’m not a unicorn?’ he said. ‘All I’m trying to do is open everyone’s minds up to these racist ideals and you are just trying to stomp them out.’ It wasn’t until the caller mentioned the previous prank that Elliott began to question his identity. ‘Last few weeks didn’t you interview an Isis fighter who turned out not to be an Isis fighter at all?’ he asked. ‘Yeah, we did and we acknowledged that, are you sure you’re Matt Colwell here?’ Elliot replied. BK Ultra (pictured) says he wanted to catch out 3AW's Tom Elliott who was recently pretending to do an interview with an ISIS fighter .

A Tweeter incredulous as to how the studio didn't check who the caller was before going to air . Although the impersonator never admitted to the hoax, he went on to ask about the show’s screening process. ‘How much research goes into who you actually interview? Or do they just ring up and say “Hi I’m 360” and I come on?’ he said. After almost nine minutes, Elliott ended the interview and then conceded on Twitter that his guest was in fact an impersonator. 'Spoke to someone on-air and off-air who said that he was rapper 360. Turns out he wasn't. We shut the interview down immediately,' he posted. The interview which was posted to social media went viral to delight of BK Ultra who posted on facebook, 'I think 360 and I almost broke the internet today.' The 'battle rapper', who has actually majored in journalism, told Project U the reason for the prank was to make an example of Elliott, who was recently caught out pretending to interview a ISIS fighter. 'didn't pursue it as a career because of sensationalist nonsense like these so called 'reporters' are responsible for.' On Wednesday BK Ultra again took to social media to post more comments and a rap about his time on 3AW. He said, 'penned a couple quick bars touching on the 360 / 3AW Drive with Tom Elliott stunt. If you like it, share it, if you hate it, tell me I'm a d******d, cheers #iPhonequalityswag.' The prank also received several comments from the authentic 360, who took to Twitter, posting his support of BK Ultra. '1 thing I hope everyone takes tonight is DONT believe eveything the media tells you,' one said. This prompted many fellow Tweeters to ridicule Elliott for falling for the stunt a second time. It was suggested Elliott was also about to interview Elvis, Jesus, 2PAC and Martin Luther King. Some posted saying they had lost all credibility for the talk back host. 'It literally took me 30 seconds to find 3ree6ixty's manger's contact info. Do you even know what research is? Clown.' RocknRollJoe. said.

"Almost three quarters of us use the same password for multiple accounts, meaning if one set of login credentials are stolen they can be used to access a wealth of private data. To tackle this, and to keep Facebook accounts safe, the social network has begun scouring the web for stolen email addresses and passwords. It then checks these credentials with those used to access the site, and if it finds a match, warns the affected user their account is at risk. Facebook has created an automated service that monitors sites for stolen credentials. It checks credentials to see if they match those being used on Facebook, and the site assured users the process is automated, meaning it doesn't know or store a user’s actual Facebook password . ‘The Facebook Security team has always kept a close eye on data breach announcements from other organisations,’ said the social network’s security engineer, Chris Long. In a blog post, he explained: ‘Theft of personal data like email addresses and passwords can have larger consequences because people often use the same password on multiple websites. ‘Unfortunately, it's common for attackers to publicly post the email addresses and passwords they steal on public 'paste' sites. ‘Our team wanted to do something to improve this situation, so we built a system dedicated to further securing people's Facebook accounts by actively looking for these public postings, analysing them, and then notifying people when we discover that their credentials have shown up elsewhere on the Internet.’ Once Facebook finds a set of stolen credentials, it passes the data into a program that 'parses' it into a standardised format. Parsing is the process of analysing a string of symbols in computer language. After the data has been downloaded and ‘parsed’, an automated system checks it against the Facebook database to see if any of the email addresses and hashed passwords match login information on Facebook. The site ‘hashes’ each password using its internal password hashing algorithm. Hashing takes each user's plain text password and runs it through a one-way mathematical function, to create a unique string of numbers and letters called the hash. Hashing makes it difficult for an attacker to move from hash back to password and it lets sites keep a list of hashes, rather than plain text passwords. This means if a list is stolen, the plain text passwords can't be obtained easily. Since Facebook stores passwords securely as hashes, it can't compare a password directly to the database. Instead, it hashes it, and compares the hashes. If the email and hash combination doesn't match, the site doesn’t take any action. If the email address and hash combination does match, Facebook notifies the user next time they log in. To do this, the site created an automated service that monitors different 'paste' sites for stolen credentials, and watches for reports of large scale data breaches. It collects the stolen credentials that have been publicly posted and checks them to see if the stolen email and password combination match the same email and password being used on Facebook. If it finds a match, Facebook notifies the affected user the next time they log in, and guides them through a process to change their password. An example message is pictured . To protect users, Facebook offers Login Approvals (pictured), which adds an extra layer of security to an account. When enabled, users must enter a code from their phone when logging in from a new browser . Last year, security experts uncovered a cache of 2 million stolen passwords to popular sites including Facebook, Google, Twitter and Yahoo. Researchers at Trustwave's SpiderLabs said they discovered the credentials while investigating a server in the Netherlands that cyber criminals use to control a massive network of hacked computers known as the ‘Pony botnet.’ The firm reported its findings to the largest of more than 90,000 websites and internet service providers whose customers' credentials it had found on the server. Representatives for Facebook and Twitter reset the passwords of affected users. Mr Long assured users that because this is an automated process,  the site doesn't know or store a user’s actual Facebook password. Instead, to check for matches, it takes the email address and password and runs them through the same secure code used to check a password each time a member logs in. If it finds a match, Facebook notifies the affected user the next time they log in. It also guides them through a process to change their password. ‘This system has worked very well for us in the past,’ continued Mr Long. ‘But we recognise that preventing stolen credentials is also important. ‘The risks are also clear: if you use the same password on lots of websites, an attacker only has to get your password once to be able to access all of those accounts.’ To protect users, Facebook offers Login Approvals, which adds an extra layer of security to an account. When enabled, users must enter a security code from their phone when logging in from a new browser.","Facebook created an automated service that monitors for stolen credentials .

"Sandra Byrnes and Jeni Winkels' friendship is one that flourished out of both tragedy and a miracle. The two women first met 13 years ago after being offered a rare opportunity to meet through a special program which connected organ donors with their transplant recipients. Almost 20 years ago, Sandra's life took an unexpected and terrible turn when her 18-year-old son Allen died after being hit by a car on the highway. Sandra Byrnes (right) and Jeni Winkels (left) became best friends when they first met 13 years ago . Describing her son as a popular and happy young man who loved sport, she was left devastated after the horrific accident. But the 60-year-old Sydney mother took solace in the fact that her son's organs would help save the lives of six other people, hoping that one day she would be given the chance to meet them. One of those people was  Jeni from Newcastle who was in dire need  of a kidney and pancreas transplant at the age of 33. Jeni had suffered from diabetes since she was only 10-years-old, and was on dialysis when she was told that doctors had found her a donor. Jeni received a kidney and pancreas transplant from Sandra's son Allen, who died after being hit by a car. They met via a special program which connected donors with their transplant recipients . 'The day I got the phone call, the first thing I thought was that somebody had died for me,' Jeni told Yours magazine. 'I thought a lot about what that person's family was going through.' Jeni began writing thank-you letters to Sandra, which were anonymously delivered by the Red Cross, until the two women were finally given the opportunity to meet. 'I died when my son died,' Sandra (left) said, 'When I met Jeni, we talked and laughed for five hours' Jeni and Sandra's story was first published in Yours . The duo had an instant connection and became the closest of friends after their initial meeting. 'I died when my son died,' Sandra told Yours magazine,'When I met Jeni, we talked and laughed for five hours.' Sandra and Jeni continued to keep in touch with Jeni always thanking her new friend for the life experiences that the young teen had given her. For Sandra, Jeni is a constant reminder or her brave son who she believes would have loved the woman whom his organs gave a second chance at life. 'She was sitting at our table [at my wedding] and when my father told everyone who she was, they gave her standing ovation,' Jeni said. 'She said in a way, it felt like Allen was the one getting married.' But the women have also been there for each other through the harder moments of life. As Jeni's transplant kidney has finally come to the end of its life, leaving her on dialysis once more and awaiting for her husband's donor status to be approved, Sandra has stood by her friend's side as a constant pillar of support.","Sandra Byrnes' son Allen, 18, died 18 years ago after being hit by a car .

"Strictly's Claudia Winkleman has been targeted by an internet troll who set up a fake Twitter account pretending to be her badly burned daughter. The troll used the name Matilda Winkleman and handle HotWinkle to mock the eight-year-old's accident on Twitter after her witch costume caught fire during an evening of trick-or-treat. Direct messages have been sent to the TV presenter, with one saying: '@ClaudiaWinkle what's your daughter's favourite dance? I'm guessing the #HotStep.' Scroll down for video . Strictly's Claudia Winkleman has been targeted by an internet troll who set up a fake Twitter account pretending to be her badly burned daughter Matilda Thykier (right) Another said: 'I was eating some monster munch at the time of story - Flamin' Hot flavour.' At least five tasteless tweets were sent from the same account, including: '@ClaudiaWinkle I fancy a bacon sarnie, extra crispy' and '@ClaudiaWinkle is it hot today or is it just me.' Matilda Thykier is being treated for severe burns after a candle on a doorstep of a house she was visiting set light to the cape of her witch's outfit last Friday. Her mother is expected to miss the second weekend of Strictly shows to look after her daughter in hospital. At least five offensive tweets were sent from a fake Twitter account using the name Matilda Winkleman . The eight-year-old (right) played a bridesmaid in the 2013 film I Give It a Year with Minnie Driver (left) Several other Twitter users have exchanged offensive tweets about the accident which shocked the presenter and her husband Kris Thykier, both 42. Maximus Spacticus under the Twitter handle ‏@CSpacula said: 'At least she won't have to fork out for a Halloween costume next year....#ClaudiaWinkleman.' Another Twitter user with the name Biggie Halls and handle @Loubmeupscotty said: 'Claudia Winkleman isn't presenting Film 2014 tonight. I don't want to suggest her daughter being burned was a good thing, but...' Last night  a source close to the couple told The Sun: 'This is the last thing they need at this difficult time and they will be devastated and stunned that anyone would sink so low and mock a badly injured child.' An expert has said the the presenter and her daughter have been targeted by a 'professional' troll who set up an account specifically to attack them. Restaurant owner Jamie Poulton said he was just feet away when he saw Matilda’s black ‘wizard’s costume’ turn into a ‘crackling ball of flame’. Ms Winkleman (left) pictured with Tess Daly, is at her daughter's bedside and it is unclear when she will return to the BBC show . He suffered second-degree burns when he plucked the eight-year-old from a group of children and put out the flames with his bare hands. To his horror, the synthetic fabric melted in his hands as he tried to tear it from the screaming child. Zoya Bacolv, seven, was out trick-or-treating with her two sisters Isla, five, and Laila, eight, and a group of adults when the accident happened. Zoya said of Matilda: 'She was outside a house when her cape caught fire, I think she was dressed as a witch. I think it was a candle outside a house that set her cape on fire. 'I saw her when the ambulance came, they had to wrap her up to put out the fire. 'She burnt her leg. They put her in a cast thing and put lots of plasters on her leg. She's going to be hospital for a week. It was really scary.' In a statement, the couple said: 'Our daughter was involved in an accident on Friday night while celebrating Halloween. She is having the best care possible and we are hopeful of a full recovery. 'We would like to thank everyone who has been so supportive and particularly the NHS doctors, nurses and staff who have been absolutely incredible.

"Christopher Barlow, 22, has been jailed for 12 years after he pleaded guilty to rape and two charges of assault with intent to commit rape at Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court on Thursday . A 22-year-old who raped a woman at knifepoint and forced her to perform a sex act before throwing a 50p coin at her feet,  has been jailed for 12 years. Christopher Barlow attacked the victim as she walked home from Hanley, Stoke-on-Trent, and attempted to rape two other women over a four week period. He took the woman to Northwood Park in January this year where he pushed a knife towards her face, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard. She vomited at the end of the ordeal and said Barlow threw the 50p coin at her feet. The warehouse worker from Birches Head, Stoke-on-Trent, pleaded guilty to rape and two charges of assault with intent to commit rape. Judge David Fletcher said: 'You pose a high risk of serious harm to the public, specifically females. 'You were growing in confidence as you continued to commit these offences. 'You utilised a weapon on three occasions and targeted lone females who were vulnerable. 'Had you not been disturbed you would have in all likelihood gone on to rape the third victim.' He was also made the subject of a sexual offences prevention order. Weeks earlier, Barlow had approached another woman with a knife in Hanley, and told her: 'Do what I say, or face the consequences.' He told the woman to perform a sex act on him or he would stab her, but she managed to run to a taxi and get away. Barlow also grabbed hold of another woman in February and tried to rape her at Central Forest Park, Hanley. He took the woman to Northwood Park in January this year where he pushed a knife towards her face . But the victim was saved when a couple in a car saw him trying to bundle her into a park and used their car headlights and horn to scare him away and he fled. The couple dialled 999 and police found Barlow hiding in a park. When officers seized his phone they discovered he had searched for 'forced sex' on the internet. Barlow's DNA was matched to samples taken from the woman in the January rape and all three victims identified him during an identity parade. The woman vomited at the end of the ordeal and said Barlow threw the 50p coin at her feet, Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard . Anis Ali, defending, said Barlow was making positive changes to his life. Speaking after the sentence, Detective Sergeant Lindon Evans, of Staffordshire Police, said: 'We are glad Barlow is off the streets. 'There is no doubt the couple in the car potentially prevented a second rape. 'These three women have suffered shocking, terrible ordeals. Thankfully this type of offence is rare.'","Christopher Barlow has been jailed for 12 years after pleading guilty to rape .

"A second DNA test will be conducted on two Burmese men accused of killing a pair of British tourists in Thailand amid fears the suspects may have been framed, the Thai premier said today. Zaw Lin and Win Zaw Tun were charged with the murder of David Miller, 24, and the rape and murder of Hannah Witheridge, 23. The pair's battered bodies were found on the southern island of Koh Tao on September 15. Thai police claimed a breakthrough in their investigation of the double murder when they said DNA from the accused migrant workers matched samples taken from the body of one of the victims. Were they framed? Burmese migrants Zaw Lin and Win Zaw TunThai participate in a crime re-enactment of the murders of two British tourists in Koh Tao, but later recanted their confessions.

Raped and murdered: The battered bodies of British backpackers Hannah Witheridge (left) and David Miller (right) were found on the southern Thai island of Koh Tao on September 15 . They said both men had also confessed and forced them to re-enact the killings in bizarre scenes before the world's media. But last week the men, both in their 20s, retracted their confessions alleging they were obtained under duress. Criticism of the police handling of the case has swirled both in Thailand and overseas. 'We will allow suspects to take another DNA test,' Prime Minister Prayut Chan-O-Cha told reporters after a weekly cabinet meeting. 'If they think that the previous tests were unfair we will conduct a second test.' It was not immediately clear if the accused had requested a second DNA test.

Thai authorities have strongly denied using the pair as scapegoats, insisting the case is built on solid evidence showing the DNA of the accused from initial tests matches samples taken from Witheridge's body. British police have been allowed to observe the investigation after the UK expressed concerns and offered to help with the probe. Before the murders, Thailand was already struggling to restore its tarnished image as a tourist haven after a May coup saw martial law imposed across the country. The murders have dented tourism, which accounts for nearly 10 per cent of gross domestic product, at a time when Thailand is still under martial law after a May military coup that had already kept some tourists away.","Thai police claimed breakthrough after saying DNA matched migrant workers .

"The NFL could be on the verge of yet another scandal with allegations emerging that one still unidentified player was allowed on the field less than a day after being accused of rape. Noted civil rights attorney Gloria Allred gave details of the rape to NFL Commissioner in a letter delivered on Friday as well as asking what the league was aware of. Allred released a press release stating that she represents 'a young woman who made a police report last Saturday alleging that an NFL player on an NFL team had raped her that morning.' Noted civil rights attorney Gloria Allred gave details of an alleged rape to NFL Commissioner Friday, claiming the unidentified player and assailant was playing less than 24 hours after the asault . 'Thereafter,' she continued, 'the accused was then allowed by his team to play the next day.' The New York Daily News reports that Allred personally delivered the letter at the NFL's Park Ave. offices. She said that she was told the package would 'be taken upstairs to (Goodell's) office and delivered to the commissioner immediately.' She would not detail the letter's exact contents but said she requested a response by Monday. Allred said she was told the letter would be immediately sent to NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, and said she wanted a response by Monday . 'Because the criminal investigation is pending and because we want to protect the privacy of our client, we have no comment on the name of the team or the name of the NFL player,' she said. The Daily News noted that neither the Jets, Bears, Falcons, or Bucs played on the day in question. Allred said both the alleged victim and player - the latter with a team representative at his side - met with police hours after the attack. 'We have asked . the NFL whether or not this alleged rape was reported to them and if . they approved this accused individual’s playing in the game . notwithstanding the allegations that had been made against him,' she wrote in the release. Timing couldn't be worse for another scandal as Goodell has already been criticized for his handling of the now infamous Ray Rice elevator assault video . The NFL Players Association did not respond to interview requests. The allegations could not come at a worse time for the league, which is still reeling from criticism over their mismanagement of ex-Baltimore Ravens player Ray Rice and the now infamous video of his violent assault of then-fiancee Janay Palmer. An NFL spokesman said Allred's letter was the first time they were told about the alleged rape. 'We have no information on this alleged incident other than her letter,' Greg Aiello, league spokesman, said.","Allred has declined to release the player's name or team affiliation as the investigation continues .

"A Lithuanian man who squirted three neighbours in the face with CS spray for playing loud music insisted such behaviour was ‘normal’ in his home country. Arunas Kastentinavicius, 26, approached the two women and one man in Hanley, Staffordshire, to complain about the volume of their music. They agreed to turn it down, but he returned to their door an hour later to make the same demand. The father-of-one said he used the gas because he ‘didn’t want to hit a woman’. Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court (pictured) heard how the man sprayed the two women and man in the face with gas after asking them to turn their music down . Stoke-on-Trent Crown Court heard the three victims suffered burning and choking sensations and one of the women was taken to hospital. Kastentinavicius pleaded guilty to possessing a prohibited weapon and to three charges of assault. Heather Chamberlin, prosecuting, said he defended his actions, telling police it was ‘normal’ behaviour in his home country. ‘Kastentinavicius said he knocked on the door and the women were shouting at him, so he sprayed them with CS spray. It is normal in Lithuania,’ she said. The man said he did not know the gas was illegal in the UK (file image) ‘The cylinder … had an 11 per cent harmful content, as opposed to spray used by police which has 5 per cent … He had asked his mother to send the spray over from Lithuania. 'He didn’t realise it was illegal.’ Kastentinavicius was given a six-month suspended sentence with 100 hours’ unpaid work and ordered to pay each victim £200. Kevin Moorlock, defending, told the court: 'The victims still live in the same block of flats and there has been no further incidents. 'He has one son. He had worked a long day and became emotional. 'In terms of the pepper spray, he says the cannister is available to buy in normal stores in Lithuania. 'It is recognised as forbidden in Germany, but he didn’t think to research if it was banned here. He has learned a harsh lesson.' Sentencing him, Judge David Mason said: 'This was a very unpleasant incident. 'You went to the door of these three people and deliberately sprayed in their faces, causing a very unpleasant injury.'","Arunas Kastentinavicius sprayed two women and man in face with gas .

"'Just friends'. With those two words, Foreign Minister Julie Bishop has tried to end suggestions that she and businessman David Panton are an item. A spokeswoman told Daily Mail Australia on Friday that 'no, no they are just friends, as soon as the stories (about them being in a relationship) appeared the Minister made it clear that they are friends'.

She may be the farm girl with a Harvard education that left a high-flying law career to embark on a life in politics. But on Tuesday the focus was on Foreign Minister Julie Bishop's apparent new relationship, rather than her policies. By her side at the Melbourne Cup Carnival was businessman David Panton, and the pair are said to have been dating for about six months, the Daily Telegraph reported. 'The Minister had never said that (they were in a relationship) it’s not true, and it’s not true that she said that they were together,' claimed the spokeswoman. Mr Panton's two adult daughters Sally and Laura also accompanied him to Flemington for day two of the Cup Carnival.

A Fairfax-Ipsos nationwide poll found Ms Bishop is now level with Prime Minister Tony Abbott in the preferred leadership stakes, both with 20 per cent support. This has been attributed to her strong showing on the international stage - particularly throughout the MH17 crisis in Ukraine - and her calm handling of government affairs in Australia.

But it appears Ms Bishop has no plans of taking the country's top job as she told Daily Mail Australia on Tuesday that she is 'living the dream and loving the job'. 'I am in the best job I could ever wish for,' she said. 'It's the job I wanted to do when I went into politics.'

"So close: Anni, on the left, with her cousin and best friend Sneha Hindochna - who was in daily contact with Anni throughout the honeymoon . The woman who holds the key to the secrets of Anni Dewani’s turbulent relationship with her husband told police she believed he was lying about the sequence of events surrounding her murder. Sneha Hindocha, Anni’s cousin and best friend, said she was suspicious of millionaire businessman Shrien Dewani’s claim that his bride wanted to visit a township in South Africa late at night on their honeymoon. In a sensational witness statement, Sneha – who was in daily contact with Anni throughout the honeymoon – insisted Anni thought the wedding was a sham and Dewani was controlling and refused to have sex. At the opening of his murder trial last week, Dewani, 34, denied having his wife – who was found dead in a black cocktail dress and diamante-encrusted high heels – shot in a staged carjacking in Cape Town four years ago. Sneha’s testimony forms the mainstay of the prosecution case. In her statement, seen by The Mail on Sunday, Sneha, 30, claims that: . A year apart in age, strikingly similar in looks, Anni and Sneha, who last week flew to Cape Town where she will give evidence at the trial, grew up together and shared a flat at university. Both were close to their siblings but the bond between the two women ran deeper than any other in their lives. ‘I knew absolutely everything, no matter how intimate or private, about Anni and she in turn knew absolutely everything about me,’ said Sneha. ‘We shared things that no other person knew or knows about.’ Denial: Shrien Dewani in Cape Town's High Court earlier this week. Sneha claims that he scolded his new bride for leaving clothes unfolded in their honeymoon suite . While upset by Dewani’s personal criticisms, it was, claimed Sneha, the lack of intimacy in their 18-month relationship that troubled Anni most. ‘She told me she had tried to be intimate but Dewani had pushed her away,’ said Sneha. ‘Anni felt embarrassed and hurt by his reaction and we felt it was weird.’ Two weeks later, while staying at Stockholm’s Hilton Hotel, he was similarly distant, leaving Anni and her cousin to conclude ‘maybe he was a virgin’ or being ‘proper’ and not wanting sex before marriage. Dewani offered an explanation later. He said he was tired from ‘hormone treatment for his infertility’. This revelation, according to Sneha, prompted Anni to break off the relationship ‘because she wanted to have children in the future but also because she did not want to be pushed away from intimacy’. Following assurances from Dewani that his treatment was now working, the couple got back together in January 2010. ‘In other words he could have children and that his now raised hormone levels would allow him to be intimate,’ said Sneha. Around this time Anni and Sneha moved to Britain from their native Sweden and shared a flat in Luton, Bedfordshire. For a while Anni’s relationship with Dewani improved but it deteriorated after he ‘travelled alone to Thailand to complete a Thai boxing course which he claimed would raise his hormone level’ apparently further. What neither Anni nor Sneha suspected at this stage was that Shrien’s sexual interests often lay elsewhere. Acting: Anni's cousin Sneha claims that Anni told her that the couple were ‘acting’ all the way through their wedding ceremony, pictured above. She also claims Dewani told his bride that her sari was not 'proper' In a dramatic opening to his long-awaited trial, Dewani pleaded his innocence but revealed he is bisexual and saw male prostitutes. It was designed to pre-empt the forthcoming appearance of Leopold Leisser, a male prostitute who claims Dewani paid him £400 a session for sex. In court he came face to face with the man he allegedly hired to murder his wife for the first time since the night of the shooting. Mziwamadoda Qwabe, 29, is one of two prosecution witnesses who have claimed that Dewani paid them to kill Anni. Dewani denied any involvement in the murder of his 28-year-old wife, who died from a gunshot wound to the neck in a rough township of Cape Town in November 2010. And he said, despite visiting male prostitutes, he was still attracted to Anni and had no reason to kill her. Throughout the spring and summer of 2010 their relationship, according to Sneha’s statement, was characterised by arguments. ‘During this time Anni told me through daily text messages, telephone calls and emails that she was not comfortable with Dewani,’ said Sneha. And in May that year, she claims, Anni was effectively ambushed into an engagement. The statement says: ‘Anni’s parents came to the UK for a visit with the intention of Anni introducing them to Dewani’s family.’ The families met and ‘the following morning Dewani’s sister-in-law Kripa came down the stairs holding a silver tray with a holy relic to bless the relationship. This came as a complete surprise to Anni, her parents and me because Anni’s parents explained that this blessing is a sign of an engagement which they were not expecting.’ According to Sneha, her cousin was ‘aware that she had about a week’ before the engagement was due to be officially announced on May 27. Two days before, she sent Dewani an email, which Sneha helped compose, calling off the engagement. But Dewani urged her to reconsider, professed his love and ‘promised to change his ways’. The engagement went ahead. In the statement, Sneha said Dewani ‘was always very controlling and very critical of Anni’s appearance’. Once he called Sneha to ask her to help him buy clothes for Anni ‘because he wanted to change, as he said, “the ugly duckling into a swan before the engagement”.’ Further emails from July 2010 describe more doubts, yet the wedding preparations continued apace. Sneha said: ‘During this time Anni sent me disturbing text messages explaining that there was a huge amount of animosity between them.’ Shooting: Prosecution witness Mziwamadoda Qwabe covers his face with his jacket as he sits  in the dock in court in 2012 . It resulted, said the statement, in Anni ‘throwing her engagement ring at Dewani... Anni explained her sadness at the fact they were fighting all the time and not sharing a bed... as he chose to sleep on the sofa.’ But once again, they got back together, and the wedding, due to last two days, was set for October 27. ‘After the first ceremony, Anni returned to our hotel room and I noticed she was upset,’ said Sneha. ‘I asked what was bothering her. She replied by asking me if I thought she looked beautiful because... Dewani’s first words to Anni as she approached him on the red carpet was “Your sari is not proper”.’ Later, while helping Anni with her make-up, Sneha says her cousin asked ‘if we looked in love’. Sneha goes on: ‘I then asked, “Why would you ask me that?” and Anni replied that she and Dewani had agreed to “act out the rest of the wedding ceremonies”.’ Doubts: Within days of the wedding Anni was talking again of leaving Dewani ‘and asked me to help her’, claimed Sneha . Within days of the wedding Anni was talking again of leaving Dewani ‘and asked me to help her’, claimed Sneha. Then Anni found out she was going to South Africa on honeymoon. Sneha said: ‘Anni was calling me on a daily basis explaining she did not want to go anywhere with Dewani, to South Africa or anywhere else, as she wanted a divorce. ‘...She also said they were not legally married as they had not had the registry marriage in the UK.’ The last time Sneha saw her cousin was on November 7 ‘when Anni, Dewani and others met up and went out to dinner so that I could introduce them to my boyfriend. The mood was very tense as Dewani was criticising Anni about her hair colour.’ The following day they left on honeymoon and five days later Sneha was told her cousin had been murdered. ‘Dewani called me, crying, as I was, so I can’t really remember much about this call.’ In court last week Dewani pleaded not guilty to five charges, including murder, kidnapping and robbery, conspiracy to commit all three, and obstructing the adminstration of justice. The trial is expected to last at least two months.","Sneha Hindocha, Anni's cousin, told police she believed Dewani was lying .

"Ade Djajamihardja was just 42 when he suffered a debilitating brain haemorrhage stroke that saw him  hospital-bound for seven months as he tried to recover. He underwent two major brain surgeries and spent weeks in an induced coma at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital. Doctors told his wife Kate Stephens he would be lucky to survive and if he did he could kiss walking, talking and even eating by himself goodbye. But that was two years ago. Ade Djajamihardja and his wife Kate returned to their Brighton home in Melbourne two years ago after a seven month stint in hospital . 'I chose to live and I chose a positive outcome,' Ade told Daily Mail Australia. While Ade is still confined to a wheelchair and has little sight and movement on his left side, he says his whole outlook on life has changed and he is healthier now than before the stroke. 'Before the stroke I lost my way with my health because I convinced myself KFC was a food group. I was smoking four packets of cigarettes a day,' he said. 'Now I meditate everyday, eat whole foods  and even though I'm in a wheelchair I exercise - I've lost 10 kg. 'Just until recently I was walking 500 metres a day, which takes about an hour. I believe that's just outside Olympic qualifying time,' he joked. Ade was just 42 when he suffered a debilitating brain haemorrhage stroke. He underwent two major brain surgeries and spent weeks in an induced coma at Melbourne's Alfred Hospital . Doctors told his wife Kate Stephens he would be lucky to survive and if he did he could kiss walking, talking and even eating by himself goodbye . But his wife Kate, who ran a film and television production company with Ade, said it was a long road for him to be positive about his situation. 'Four months after his stroke they put him in front of a mirror for the first time. During the surgery they took a large part of his skull out - he had to wear a helmet because he had a big dent in his head,' she said. 'When he looked in the mirror he found it quite upsetting. He asked the pathologist if he would ever drive again and when the doctor said no he started crying.' Ade had a section of his skull removed to relieve pressure on his brain. He had to wear a helmet most days to protest the visible hole in his head . After six months, doctors operated again to put the piece of his skull back in place. A few weeks later, Kate was able to take Ade home for the first time . Ade told Kate he didn't want to be a burden on her and said he would throw himself down the hospital stairs in his wheelchair. 'But then the nurse reminded us we were on the ground floor so I couldn't even if I tried,' Ade said. 'That's when I made the big decision and started focusing on my goal of full optimal health.' During his gruelling six months in rehabilitation, Ade had to learn to breathe, sit up, talk and read again. 'I kept saying, ""I’m not stupid, I’m just injured"",' he said. 'We would have little ways of coping to make us laugh. I was feeding him like a baby and taking him to the toilet. Ade would always joke, even when he had his skull bone put back in,' Kate said. While Ade is still confined to a wheelchair and has little sight and movement on his left side, he says his whole outlook on life has changed and he is healthier now than before the stroke . Ade has started walking for the first time since his stroke. Up until recently he could walk 500 metres a day in one hour . After six months, doctors operated again to put the piece of his skull back in place. 'I briefed the medical team when they put the skull bone back and said if you let me die I’m going to come and haunt you all – it was my way of coping,' Ade said. Just a few weeks later, Ade was allowed to go back to his Brighton home for the first time. The couple have since released a book about Ade's survival tools in hospital and how he was able to stay positive and happy throughout the rough period in his life. During his gruelling six months in rehabilitation, Ade had to learn to breathe, sit up, talk and read again . Ade has lost 10kg from eating better, giving up smoking and exercising daily with the help of Kate . 'I'm very much focused on achieving full health and I wanted to inspire others,' he said. 'I would like to be financially independent in the next year or so. 'We also haven’t given up the idea of having a child.'

"Smooth jazz star Kenny G has angered Chinese authorities by visiting a pro-democracy rally in Hong Kong and posing with the protesters. The American musician caused a stir when he tweeted about his visit to the semi-autonomous city, where thousands of student-led demonstrators have occupied the streets for the past three weeks. Having posed with the protesters' tents and taking selfies with their placards, the Chinese Foreign Ministry - which has claimed the protests are fueled by outside agents – publicly declared that Kenny G had been participating in an 'illegal activity.' Kenny G has now deleted the selfie and issued an apology on Twitter, insisting he is not a foreign provocateur, does not support the protests and knows nothing of the situation in Hong Kong. Not a supporter: This selfie - uploaded to Twitter by Kenny G - was captioned: 'In Hong Kong at the sight of the demonstration. I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation'. The tweet is now deleted . Kenny G made his apology after after Beijing signaled its displeasure over his inharmonious visit and repeated concerns about meddling by external forces. In the caption of one image he uploaded to Twitter, the musician wrote: 'In Hong Kong at the sight of the demonstration. I wish everyone a peaceful and positive conclusion to this situation.' He took to social media again later to declare that he was not trying to defy the Chinese government, but rather had just happened to come across the protest zone while walking around as a tourist. 'I am not supporting the demonstrators as I don't really know anything about the situation,' he wrote on his Twitter and Facebook accounts.

The musician's  soprano saxophone are wildly popular in China, especially his song 'Going Home.' The laidback track is regularly heard at closing time at train stations, department stores, airports, hotel lobbies and over loudspeakers in public parks. He completed a four-concert tour of the country in September. Demonstrations: Beijing has warned repeatedly that unspecified foreign forces are influencing the protesters in Hong Kong, without spelling out who exactly is involved . Protesters stand in the rain and listen to speeches at the main Hong Kong protest site yesterday evening . When asked about the appearance, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying paused and noted Kenny G's popularity - and then warned foreigners not to get involved. 'I think Kenny G's music is popular in China, though regarding the illegal protest in Hong Kong, the Chinese government has a clear position. We think that is an illegal campaign,' Hua said. 'We support the government of Hong Kong to handle it in accordance with the law to maintain stability in Hong Kong. Thus we hope all foreign countries and individuals could be discreet in words and deeds and not support the illegal protest in any forms,' she said. Beijing has warned repeatedly that unspecified foreign forces are influencing the protesters in Hong Kong, without spelling out who exactly is involved. Hong Kong's Beijing-backed leader, Leung Chun-ying, has also recently taken up the claims.","American musician visited Hong Kong protests tweeting several photos .

"Healthy food is three times more expensive than less nutritious alternatives, a study has found. And the cost of eating well is rising much faster than that of eating poorly. Researchers found that in 2012, the average price for 1,000 calories of healthy food was £7.49. This compared to £5.65 in 2002. However, the same amount of unhealthy food was just £2.50 in 2012, compared to £1.77 a decade earlier. Researchers found that 1,000 calories of unhealthy food was £2.50 compared to £7.49 for healthy food . The ‘cost per calorie’ of 94 key foods and drinks was tracked by a team from Cambridge University, who used government criteria to define what was ‘healthy’. They suggested that more could be done to take into account the cost of living well when making decisions about public health. Dr Pablo Monsivais, from the university’s Centre for Diet and Activity Research, said: ‘To help achieve long-term improvements in eating habits, we need to address the high and rising prices of healthier foods. ‘This is likely to be influenced by a number of factors including agricultural policy, food distribution and retail pricing strategies. ‘Additionally, there is growing evidence that targeted subsidies can promote healthy eating for people on low incomes.’ Diet-related illness costs the NHS an estimated £5.8billion annually, the researchers said. A quarter of adults and a fifth of children are obese, with the rate almost doubling over the last 20 years. Researchers discovered that unhealthy, fatty food was far cheaper than the healthy alternative . The chief executive of the NHS Simon Stevens warned last month ‘obesity is the new smoking’ in terms of avoidable illness. He said: ‘If, as a nation, we keep piling on the pounds around the waistline, we’ll be piling on the pounds in terms of taxes needed just to keep the NHS afloat.’ He is expected to unveil a five-year plan for the NHS this month including proposals on how to tackle the country’s obesity epidemic. The warning came after England’s chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies told MPs in March that a ‘sugar tax’ may be necessary to curb expanding waistlines. NHS chief executive Simon Stevens warned that month that the obesity epidemic is the new smoking . A report from Public Health England also suggested that putting a 20 per cent tax on fizzy drinks would cut the number of overweight Britons by quarter of a million. The document was released earlier this year, and identifies six possible ways of reducing sugar intake: higher tax, foods being reformulated, tighter advertising rules, warnings on packaging and encouraging farmers to grow healthier produce. Lead author of the latest Cambridge research, Nicholas Jones, agreed that people need to be encouraged to eat the right things. ‘Food poverty and the rise of food banks have recently been an issue of public concern in the UK,’ he said. ‘But as well as making sure people don’t go hungry it is also important that a healthy diet is affordable.’ He added: ‘The increase in the price difference between more and less healthy foods is a factor that may contribute towards growing food insecurity, increasing health inequalities, and a deterioration in the health of the population.’ In 2013 a survey revealed that price was the most important factor to UK consumers when buying food. More than a third said it was the most important factor and 91 per cent said it was one of their top five. By contrast, just 9 per cent of UK consumers considered nutritional value to be the most important factor when buying food, and only 49 per cent placed it among their top five criteria.","Scientists compared the price of healthy and unhealthy foods for 10 years .
Healthy food costs increased from £5.65 for 1,000 calories to £7.49 in 2012 .

"The bloody battle for Kobane has become a spectacle  for local Turks who are being sold snacks by local vendors while they watch the fighting from nearby hills. The battle for the Syrian border city has taken a dramatic turn  with 700 Kurdish residents left trapped inside the city after ISIS jihadists cut off its only escape route. While the fighting continues, Turkish locals are gathering to watch the Kurds' last stand from the safety of distant hilltops, where they sit with binoculars and bagels delivered to them by local food sellers. A breadseller caters to groups of Turks who have gathered to watch the fall of Kobane . A man purchases a bagel to snack on while he watches the battle  in the distance . A group of men, armed with binoculars, watch the fighting from the safety of a  hill near the Turkish border . The battle for the city has raged for several weeks, but jihadists have now encircled the town to trap residents who haven't fled, as well as to stop ground support arriving. Concerns are now being raised for 700 mainly elderly citizens who remain inside Kobane and  face massacre at the militants' hands. Meanwhile, the UN has appealed to Turkey to allow any willing volunteers to cross the border into Syria to assist the massively outgunned Kurdish forces battling ISIS. The situation has evoked memories of the breakup of Yugoslavia when Bosnian Serb forces marched into the town of Srebrenica, which was supposed to be under U.N. protection, and gunned down more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys at execution sites. Staffan de Mistura, the United Nations' envoy to Syria, appealed to Turkey to let ""volunteers"" cross the frontier so that they can reinforce Kurdish militias defending the town that lies within sight of Turkish territory. He revived memories of the breakup of Yugoslavia when Bosnian Serb forces marched into the town of Srebrenica, which was supposed to be under U.N. protection, and gunned down more than 8,000 Muslim men and boys at execution sites. 'Do you remember Srebrenica? We do. We never forgot and probably we never forgave ourselves,' de Mistura said. Turkey has stationed tanks on hills overlooking Kobani but so far refused to intervene without a comprehensive deal with the United States and other allies on the Syrian civil war. It has also prevented Turkish Kurds from crossing the frontier to reinforce their fellow Kurds defending the town. He added: 'We would like to appeal to the Turkish authorities... to allow the flow of volunteers at least and their own equipment in order to be able to enter the city and contribute to a self-defence action.' While much of the population has already fled the Islamic State offensive, 500-700 mostly elderly people were still sheltering in the mainly Kurdish town, while 10,000-13,000 were also trapped nearby in a border area between Syria and Turkey. They were all likely to be massacred if the last remaining exit point from Kobani fell, de Mistura said.

"A 104-year-old woman received 6,000 birthday cards after a social media campaign became an internet sensation. Betty Musker was sent cards and gifts sent from all over the world - including Australia, Singapore and China - ahead of her milestone birthday yesterday. The Liverpool FC fan even had a very special visit from former star Ian Rush yesterday and was given a personalised Liverpool strip and a card signed by the current squad. Mrs Musker was overwhelmed and surprised all of the cards were for her and said it was 'lovely people had taken the time out the send them' The avid Liverpool FC fan even had a very special visit from former striker Ian Rush . Due to the overwhelming amount, Mrs Musker's cards had their own designated space at the local post office . Betty's family and staff at Golborn House care home in Warrington, Cheshire, launched the Facebook campaign last month. They invited people to send cards to the popular great-great-grandmother. Lorraine Marshall, one of Betty's carers, said: 'I can't bear football, but she's Reds mad. 'She watches every game, she even watched the whole world cup. She's football crazy. 'She's a lovely, lovely lady, and she loves her hometown of Liverpool. 'Betty has made cards all her life, and when I asked her what she wanted for her birthday, she said 'just a nice card, I love cards', and that's how the seed was planted. 'She's completely with it, she knows everything that's going on. But she'll be very surprised when she gets all these cards on her birthday.' Mrs Musker was born in Liverpool in 1910 and began working for the Dunlop plimsoll company before she married. She then worked at St Paul's Eye Hospital in Liverpool as a nurse before working as a clipper who checked bus tickets. As she got older Mrs Musker became a cleaner for a private company . Mrs Musker told her great-granddaughter Alison Whittle she wanted 'a nice card' for her birthday . Cards have been posted for her from countries including the US, Japan, New Zealand and Australia .

"Google Glass has already been labelled as being ‘as dangerous as texting’ when worn while driving, and now new research claims it also causes significant problems with vision. A study of Glass users found that the headset obstructs the wearer’s peripheral view, meaning it creates a far larger blind spot, compared to standard glasses. Experts have now warned against wearing the device while performing tasks that require peripheral vision, such as driving and cycling, as it may be dangerous. Scroll down for video . Researchers from the University of California San Francisco found Google Glass (shown being worn by Google founder Sergey Brin pictured) obstructs the wearer’s peripheral view, in particular, an area known as the ‘superior-temporal quadrant’. This means the device creates a far larger blind spot than standard glasses . Motorists and pedestrians both rely heavily on peripheral vision to spot other vehicles, particularly at dusk or at night when light levels are low. Dr Edward Koo, a clinical ophthalmologist at the University of California San Francisco, said the position of the prism that Google Glass uses to project its images to the eye was what caused the blind spots. He said the obstruction created by the prism poses a particular risk to motorists  as it could obscure oncoming traffic. 'Google Glass produces a significant blocking effect of the right peripheral vision', Dr Koo continued. ‘The defect would not be compensated by the left eye and thus may negatively impact daily activities such as driving, cycling and running.’ The researchers analysed the vision field of three different volunteers wearing Google Glass, and compared it to them wearing normal spectacles. Texting with Google Glass is just as distracting and dangerous for drivers as using a smartphone. Research has discovered that using the tech giant’s hands-free headset makes motorist delay slamming on their brakes to avoid a collision. And this delay is similar to that caused when drivers use more traditional mobile devices. However, the Glass wearers were able to recover control of their cars faster and more effectively afterwards. The study, carried out by the University of Central Florida, asked 40 people in their 20s to drive in a car simulator either using Glass or smartphones. Their reactions were recorded when a ‘vehicle’ ahead stalled. The researchers compared text-messaging participants’ reactions on each device to times when they were just driving without multitasking. They found the prism of the Google Glass impeded vision in the upper right hand corner of their vision, also known as the ‘superior-temporal quadrant’, while the normal glasses had little impact. Dr Koo said: ‘The superior-temporal quadrant is particularly important in driving as the location of the rear-view mirror as well as the right-side mirror in all US cars is monitored by the right visual field. ‘Motion detected in these mirrors by a normal peripheral visual field is what frequently alerts a driver to possible dangerous situations. ‘In the UK, where the driving position is reversed, the potential blockage of right peripheral vision for on-coming traffic may be even more of a public safety hazard. ‘The right peripheral field is also essential for many other activities such as providing the ability to perceive obstacles and hazards when cycling or jogging on the roadway.’ The researchers, whose findings are published in the journal Jama, also analysed more than 100 images from the internet of people wearing Google Glass to look for variations in the position over the eye. They found that many people wore the devices so the prisms overlapped the centre of their pupil, which they warn could cause further blind spots. The study will be a blow to Google, which has seen its Google Glass devices banned in a growing number of locations due to concerns over privacy. Cinemas in the US banned the use of Google Glass in movie theatres last month, while the Department for Transport in the UK has warned that the device could distract motorists. It is expected to fall foul of similar legislation that bans the use of mobile phones while behind the wheel. Dr Edward Koo, a clinical ophthalmologist at the university, said the position of the prism that Google Glass (pictured) uses to project its images to the eye was what caused the blind spots. He said that the obstruction created by the prism would pose a particular risk to motorists in the UK as it could obscure oncoming traffic . A spokesman for Google Glass (diagram pictured) insisted there were no safety issues when the device is used correctly. He said: ‘Put on your shades, glasses, baseball hat, or hoodie, and you’ll quickly see this study tells us what we already know - wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision' Google has been working with companies such as Mercedes-Benz to integrate Google Glass into their cars. This, warned Dr Koo, would not be a good idea. However, he and his team are now working with Google to help them develop Google Glass so that it can be used more safely. He said: ‘Our findings in this initial study show that the Google Glass device can potentially have a negative impact on the right peripheral vision of wearers. This can present safety issues not only to the wearers but for those around them as well. ‘Due to these possible public safety implications, we are planning on doing a significantly larger study to further assess the impact these types of devices have on visual function and attentiveness. ‘We reached out to Google prior to release of the study and it was clear that user safety was of utmost importance to them as well. ‘We are looking forward to working closely with them as we develop our next study as this would be a great opportunity for them to be involved and help drive improvement of their device.’ A spokesman for Google Glass insisted there were no safety issues when the device is used correctly. He said: ‘Put on your favourite shades, glasses, baseball hat, or hoodie, and you’ll quickly see that this study tells us what we already know- wearing something on your face or head may affect your peripheral vision. ‘From the beginning, the Glass team has worked closely with a range of experts to develop a device that is safe for use, and after extensive study they have not found any safety issues when it’s used correctly.’","Study of Glass users found headset obstructs the wearer’s peripheral view .

"With a $700,000 advance and a first run of 200,000 copies, Gov. Cuomo's book turned in dismal first-week figures with less than 1,000 copies sold – but the Ebola quarantines could pick up hisnumbers . Governor Andrew Cuomo is so sure New York health care workers won't mind mandatory Ebola quarantines that he's giving them reading lists – starting with his own poorly selling memoir. 'All Things Possible: Setbacks and Success in Politics and Life' sold just 945 hardcover copies during its first week, despite a $700,000 advance from Harper Collins and a first print run of 200,000. Cuomo, well aware the book has quickly become a punch-line bookstore remainder, worked it into his remarks about Ebola quarantines on Monday – as a joke to soothe the tempers of New York doctors and nurses who have returned from west Africa only to find themselves confined to their apartments for three weeks. 'I'm asking those people who were in contact with infected people – stay at home for 21 days,' he said. 'We will pay. Enjoy your family. Enjoy your kids. Enjoy your friends. Read a book. Read my book.' 'You don't have to read my book,' Cuomo added after a comic beat. 'But stay at home for 21 days.' 'All things Possible' has performed so abysmally at the cash register that Amazon.com until Sunday didn't have it listed as a top seller in any of its thousands of book categories. One accolade emerged Monday morning: The Cuomo volume is ranked #36 among books on leadership. But ranked ahead of him are a two-year-old tome titled 'The Anti-Obama Book'; a three-year old remembrance of Chinese dictator Deng Xiaopeng; and a four-year-old treatise by Peggy Noonan titled 'The Case Against Hillary Clinton.' Cuomo (left) and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie (right) have both run afoul of the CDC by instituting state-level quarantines for people who came into contact with Ebola patients in Africa . Science lesson: Cuomo was at a Long Island middle school on Monday to ceremonially receive a statewide report on progress toward education goals . Guffaws aside, Cuomo said he's deadly serious about enforcing a quarantine policy that's more sweeping than what the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the federal government's public health pronouncer, requires. 'I disagree with the CDC,' he told reporters Monday after an appearance at a Long Island middle school. 'At the end of the day, I am the governor of the state of New York. I would rather be, in this situation, a little over-cautious.' And inconveniencing health care workers for three weeks, he said, 'is greatly outweighed, in my opinion, by the potential risk.' The policy Gov. Cuomo defended is the same one that got Chris Christie, his counterpart in New Jersey, in hot water over the weekend. Kaci Hickox, a Maine nurse who returned to the U.S. from western Africa by way of Newark Liberty International Airport found herself in a hospital isolation tent for several days while CDC officials evaluated her symptoms. She had volunteered to treat Ebola patients there, triggering the first of several conditions that made her subject to increased scrutiny upon her return. Hickox was released Monday and sent home to Maine at New Jersey taxpayers' expense. But Christie insisted he hadn't backed down. 'I didn't reverse any decision,' he told reporters in Florida, where he was campaigning with Gov. Rick Scott. 'If she was continuing to be ill she would have to stay,' Christie said. 'She hadn't had any symptoms for 24 hours and she tested negative for Ebola so there's no reason to keep her.' If Hickox had been a New Jerseyan, she would have been permitted to quarantine herself at home. The same policy is now in place in New York, Illinois, and – with some nuanced differences – in Maryland. 'This is going to become a national policy eventually,' Christie said Monday. 'Eventually the CDC will come around.' Kaci Hickox, a Maine nurse who returned to the U.S. from western Africa by way of Newark, New Jersey, was kept in isolation against her will for several days . No regrets: Christie said Monday in Florida that he put the right policy in place, and denied reports that he took a U-turn to satisfy the White House . Cuomo, too, said he's enforcing the same policy he started out with on Friday. And he denied the Obama administration was leaning on him to come in line with the CDC's more relaxed, voluntary, guidelines. 'There was no pressure from the White House,' he said, 'and as a matter of fact I am in disagreement with the CDC's policy – and I still am in disagreement with the CDC's policy.' Cuomo also said that public health workers check up on quarantined New Yorkers twice every day at random times. 'You'd better be home when they come,' he warned. 'If you're not home then you've violated the quarantine.' The governor insisted that for New Yorkers who fall in that category, there are legal measures at his disposal. 'If – if people didn't comply,' he said, 'by law we can mandate it.'","Empire State guv's new book is gathering dust on shelves, selling just 945 copies in its first week despite a $700,000 publisher's advance .
'Enjoy your family. Enjoy your kids. Enjoy your friends. Read a book. Read MY book,' Cuomo said, warning that quarantines are mandatory for some .

"A teenage girl with 'tremendous promise' as a footballer has died after suddenly collapsing at her home just days after scoring her first goal at a top women's team. Lydia Bennett died 'within an hour' of taking ill at her family home in Tamworth, Staffordshire, on November 4. Today her family paid tribute to the 'beautiful' teenager who had been planning a future in sports. Tragic: Lydia Bennett died this week after collapsing at her home in Tamworth, Staffordshire. The 17-year-old was described as a 'bubbly' teenager by her football team mates . 'We have three beautiful children, of which Lydia is one,' Paul and Carole Bennett said in a statement with their daughters, Rachel and Charlotte. 'We are all missing her so deeply, it is hurting so much.' Lydia, who had been playing for Burton Ladies FC at the time of her death, fell ill at home on Tuesday and rapidly deteriorated, her father said. 'It was roughly about an hour afterwards, it was so sudden. We don't know what the cause is.' The teenager, described as 'adored by everyone' at her football club, had been planning a career in sports. 'She wanted a career in sports either as a teacher or player. That's what she was studying towards,' Mr Bennett added. 'As her family we would like to thank her friends, colleagues and team mates for their support and such kind words. 'Adored by everyone': Friends and family today paid tribute to the teenager who was loved by 'all' at her football club . Burton Albion cancelled this weekend's games in memory of the teenager. The cause of Lydia's death is not yet known . 'She was beautiful, lovely, wonderful, just the best daughter anyone could wish to have. I don't know what we can do without her.' Just days before her tragic death the 17-year-old scored her first goal for Burton Ladies FC. Adam Smallman, head of football at the club, said the teenager's death had come as a shock to all who knew her. 'It looks like its just one of those tragic things that came out of the blue with no warning. 'She was fighting fit and trained four times a week, she was proving a real talent who I'm sure would have gone on to have a successful career. 'Lydia was showing tremendous promise and was over the moon to score her first goal for the team at the weekend.' A statement previously published on the club's website described her as a 'popular and proud' team member. 'Lydia was a very popular and proud member of Burton Albion and her family, team mates and coaching staff will be supported through this difficult period. 'The thoughts of the whole Brewers family are with Lydia’s family and friends at this sad time. 'As a mark of respect this Sunday’s games have been cancelled for our women’s first and development teams,' it said. Nicola Mellor, female football lead at Burton Albion Community Trust added 'Lydia was a very bubbly person who was adored by every member of the girls football and education programme. 'Lydia always put 100 per cent effort into everything she did with the club.' It is understood the teenager died in Good Hope hospital  after collapsing at the home she shared with her sisters and parents. Her older sister Rachel paid tribute to the schoolgirl on Facebook, writing: 'I love u baby sister. Im so proud of all u have achieved in the past 17 years. I adore u n wish that u didnt have to leave me. I love n miss u every second (sic).' A spokesman for Staffordshire Police confirmed the death was not being treated as suspicious.","Lydia Bennett died on November 4 after collapsing at her home .

"The parents of the model shot dead by Oscar Pistorius say they do 'not feel that justice has been done' but insisted they 'have to accept' the sentence imposed by the judge. Pistorius, 27, known as the Blade Runner, was yesterday jailed for five years for killing his girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp, 29, but could be out of prison in just 10 months. The sentence has been criticised by some as too lenient and sparked calls for it to be increased. Scroll down for video . 'Disappointed': Reeva Steenkamp's parents, June and Barry, do not believe justice has been served after Oscar Pistorius was handed a five-year jail term for killing their daughter - meaning he could be out in just 10 months . Miss Steenkamp's parents told ITV's Good Morning Britain they accepted the sentence and 'don't want revenge' or for the double-amputee to 'suffer with his disabilities' while prison. But they said their daughter's death in the early hours of Valentine's Day last year remained shrouded in mystery, adding that 'only Oscar knows' the truth. Miss Steenkamp's mother June told the programme: 'I think the law must take its course, we have to accept what has happened. 'If there is an appeal, well, there is an appeal. There is nothing we can change about that. But it will be difficult to go on even further, again. 'We may not feel that justice has been done, but we have just got to accept what the judge decided.

'That's the law, although it could have been completely different if her decision was different. 'Not everyone is entirely happy. But ... the facts that she had before her maybe weren't enough. But we have to live.' Mrs Steenkamp said the family had been 'disappointed in her (the judge's) judgment', but felt the judge was left with few options because 'she only had certain facts before her'.

"A wrought-iron gate bearing the Nazis' infamous 'Work sets you free' slogan has been stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany. Security guards at the site, near Munich, discovered the gate bearing the words 'Arbeit macht frei' was missing yesterday morning. The slogan was meant to convey to the prisoners who passed under it that they could attain spiritual freedom through hard work for the Fatherland. However, for many it marked their entrance to a living hell. Scroll down for video . Stolen: This wrought-iron gate bearing the Nazis' infamous 'Work sets you free' slogan has been stolen from the former Dachau concentration camp in Germany . The gate, which measures 75 by 37 inches, was set into a larger iron structure, and police said the thieves would have had to climb over another gate in order to reach it. Police said they found nothing in the immediate vicinity of the camp and appealed for anyone who noticed any suspicious people or vehicles to come forward. Dachau, near Munich, was the first concentration camp set up by the Nazis in 1933. More than 200,000 people from across Europe were held at the camp and more than 40,000 prisoners died there before it was liberated by U.S. forces on April 29, 1945. Forced labour: Dachau inmates manufacturing weapons at the camp, which was opened in 1933 . Freedom: French prisoners sing their national anthem as U.S. troops liberate the camp in April 1945 . The camp is now open to the public as a memorial. Memorial director Gabriele Hammermann has condemned the theft of the gate, which she described as 'the central symbol for the prisoners' ordeal,' according to German news agency dpa. She said a private security service supervises the site but officials had decided against surveillance of the former camp with video cameras because they didn't want to turn it into a 'maximum-security unit.' Ms Hammermann said that decision may now have to be reviewed. Similarity: In December 2009, the infamous 'Arbeit macht frei' sign that spanned the main gate of the Auschwitz death camp, built by the Nazis in occupied Poland, was stolen . A blog posting by Israel's Yad Vashem Holocaust memorial wrote that 'while we do not know who is behind the theft of the sign, the theft of such a symbolic object is an offensive attack on the memory of the Holocaust.' In December 2009, the infamous 'Arbeit macht frei' sign that spanned the main gate of the Auschwitz death camp, built by the Nazis in occupied Poland, was stolen. Police found it three days later cut into pieces in a forest on the other side of Poland. Anders Högström, a Swedish former neo-Nazi leader, was found guilty of instigating that theft and jailed in his homeland. Five Poles also were convicted of involvement and imprisoned. The sign was replaced with a replica and the original is now behind glass in a museum. Located on the grounds of a former munitions factory close to the medieval town of the same name, Dachau concentration camp was established in March 1933, just a few weeks after Adolf Hilter was appointed Reich Chancellor. The camp was intended to house political prisoners, and served as a model for all concentration camps that would follow, as well as a 'school for violence' for the SS commanders who ran it. As the Nazi reign continued, the purpose of the camp was extended to include forced labour, and began to take in Jews, ordinary criminals and foreign prisoners from countries Germany invaded. Prisoners were under the constant threat of punishment including beatings as well as forced labour. Scientific experiments also took place at the camp, including testing of new medications, attempts to make seawater drinkable, and methods to stop excessive bleeding. Hundreds of inmates died or were left disabled by these experiments. In 1942 a new crematorium was built at the site which included a gas chamber, although there is no evidence this was used to murder prisoners. Instead those who were judged too sick or weak to work were sent to the Hartheim euthanasia centre. In a final act of cruelty, guards at the camp forced more than 7,000 prisoners, most of them Jewish, on a death march as American troops drew close in April 1945. Many of the starved and weak prisoners who struggled to keep up were shot dead. By the time it was liberated by U.S. forces on April 29, 1945, more than 200,000 people had been held in Dachau and its subsidiary camps, 41,500 of whom died there. After the war, SS soldiers awaiting trial were held at Dachau, and it was also used as a U.S. military base during the occupation of Germany. Dachau is now open to the public as a memorial.","Wrought iron gate measuring 75 by 37 inches taken from site near Munich .

"An ex-prosecutor and his wife in Pittsburgh have been sentenced for endangering the welfare of two adopted Ethiopian children after county welfare officials found the boy had been underfed and the girl physically abused. Douglas Barbour, 35, who resigned from the state attorney general's office last year, pleaded no contest to misdemeanor counts in June and was sentenced to five years' probation on Monday. Kristen Barbour, a 32-year-old stay-at-home mother who was the children's primary caretaker, was sentenced to six to 12 months in alternative housing followed by four years' probation. Pennsylvania attorney Douglas Barbour and his wife Kristen seen leaving court on Monday . The Franklin Park couple was charged in October 2012, when the boy was six and found to be malnourished, and the girl was 18 months old and had multiple head fractures in various stages of healing. 'It was like they were breaking a horse, not raising a child,' said Assistant Allegheny County District Attorney Jennifer DiGiovanni. 'It was unconscionable that this went on. The very minute (the boy) was taken out of their care he began to thrive.' Kristen Barbour told the court she decided to adopt the children in March 2012 after making church missions trips to developing countries. Doctors found evidence of abuse when the boy was treated for an infection in September 2012. The boy weighed 37.5 pounds, nearly 10 pounds less than when he had been adopted, and told investigators he was forced to eat meals in the bathroom or stand alone in there whenever he urinated or defecated in his pants. The girl's injuries have never been explained. The Barbours have regained custody of two biological children, ages two and five, who were found not to be abused. Another couple has since adopted the Ethiopian children. The boy told his new adoptive mother, Alison Patterson, that it hurt when Kristen Barbour 'scribbled my face in the carpet when I peed,' Patterson testified Monday. Kristen Barbour told the court, 'I'm not a monster as some have portrayed me.' She added: 'I wish the children a good life. I hope they find it in their heart to forgive.'","Douglas Barbour, 35,was sentenced to five years' probation .

"Justice: Carmen Montelongo, 54, of California, has been convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Samuel Wiggins, 62, in May 2011 . A 54-year-old California woman was sentenced to 26 years to life this week after being convicted of stabbing to death her boyfriend, dismembering his body and burying some of the remains in potted plants. Carmen Montelongo, of Riverside, was found guilty in late August of first-degree murder in connection to the grisly 2011 slaying of 62-year-old Samuel Wiggins. ‘We are pleased that the jury saw the case for what it was — a heinous crime — and that justice was served for the victim and his family,’ said Deputy District Attorney Erica Gallegos in a press release. Ms Montelongo, who also goes by the alias Montenegro, was arrested in late May 2011 after she was spotted wheeling a barrel in San Bernadino, California, reeking of decomposing flesh. Police officers who became suspicious of the malodorous container looked inside and found a man's torso and two legs mingled with soil. The rest of the victim’s remains, including the head, were discovered hidden inside two flower pots at a home in the Los Angeles suburb of Bell Gardens, NBC Los Angeles reported. Mr Wiggins was reported missing by his relatives in early May 2011 - about a month after he was last seen alive . According to the prosecutors, Montelongo killed him a short time later by stabbing her boyfriend twice in the chest and 22 times in the back.

Cover-up: The woman lied to police about being in contact with the missing man so she could clean up the crime scene and withdraw money from his bank accounts . She then tried to cover up the crime by telling police that she was in regular contact with Wiggins. By the time detectives arrived at his home, the crime scene had been cleaned up and the carpet and floor tiles removed, according to Los Angeles Times. The woman lived in her slain boyfriend's house and used his bank accounts until May 29, 2011, when she was caught by detectives looking into her possible involvement in Wiggins' disappearance carting away his body parts in a bin. Two of Montelongo's grown children, Daniel and Chanel Ortiz, were initially arrested on suspicion of helping their mother dispose of the body, but they were never charged.","Carmen Montelongo, 54, of California, has been convicted of first-degree murder in the death of Samuel Wiggins, 62, in May 2011 .
