"By . Rebecca Seales . Updated: . 08:32 EST, 20 January 2012 . A woman driver has said she is 'thankful to be alive' after she drove her car onto a level crossing. Sarah Frampton, 28, failed to spot any of the flashing lights, claxons and warning signs as she drove towards the crossing in Trencreek, Cornwall. She pulled onto the tracks and suddenly spotted a single carriage First Great Western train hurtling down the local branch line towards her. Near-death experience: Driver Sarah Frampton of St Newlyn East, Cornwall, said she felt 'lucky to be alive' after driving onto a level crossing in Trencreek, Cornwall . Wrecked: The train sliced the front off Miss Frampton's Peugeot 406 and span it around on its axis - but she managed to walk away without a scratch . The train ripped the front off her Peugeot 406 and span it around on its axis - but Miss Frampton managed to walk away without a scratch. There were just two passengers on the 19.25 Newquay to Par service, who were uninjured as the train was not derailed. Miss Frampton, from nearby St Newlyn East, Cornwall, said she desperately tried to brake her car when she saw the train but could not stop before the impact. She said: 'I'd been rushed off my feet all day and was not aware that there was a warning at the crossing. 'I don't often come down that road. I was travelling fairly slowly and out of the blue saw the train. 'I slammed on the brakes, but it was coming too fast and hit me. It was quite overwhelming how close I was. I am very thankful to be alive.' Police were immediately called after the incident, which happened at 7.40pm yesterday, and officers arrived at the scene in just six minutes. Crash site: Trencreek Road level Crossing in Cornwall. Miss Frampton failed to spot a First Great Western passenger train before she pulled onto the tracks. Shocked but unhurt: Police arrived at the scene of the crash within 6 minutes, but Miss Frampton will now face questions to establish whether she committed any offences under the Road Traffic Act . The accident happened at the Trencreek Road level crossing on the Newquay to Par branch line, a 21-mile route which links the popular tourist town to the mainline through Cornwall. A spokesman for Network Rail said the crossing did not have barriers but was controlled automatically. He said: 'The crossing has no physical barriers but there are flashing lights, signs and an audible klaxon to warn drivers that a train is approaching. 'Tests are currently being carried out but there is no indication that there was any problem with the equipment. It seemed to be in full working order.' A spokesman for the British Transport Police said Miss Framton will now face questioning by officers to ascertain whether any laws were broken. He said: 'Officers are investigating the incident and enquiries are on-going today to establish the full circumstances which led up to the collision. 'No one suffered any injuries at the scene. 'The single-carriage train was travelling at low speed and remained upright on the tracks. Only two passengers were on board the train at the time of the collision. 'The driver of the car, a 28-year-old woman, will be spoken to by BTP officers to establish whether any offences have occurred under the Road Traffic Act. 'The Rail Accident Investigation Branch (RAIB) has been informed.'","Driver will be questioned by British Transport Police .
Says of horror crash: 'I'd been rushed off my feet all day and was not aware there was a warning'"
"By . Sam Webb . Parents are furious that a firm is selling cans of an energy drink called 'Cocaine' in a busy shopping centre. Jeb Kenneth, 51, is selling the drink in Freshney Place in the Lincolnshire town of Grimsby - with the tagline 'Get high on life, not on drugs'. Mr Kenneth, who describes himself as the director and brand originator of the drink, owns Cocaine Ltd and says the drink has been given the name to 'shock in order to grab people's attention'. Can of coke? An energy drink called 'Cocaine' was on sale at a shopping centre in Grimsby, drawing an angry reaction from parents. The entrepreneur behinf the drink, Jeb Kenneth, has defended the name . The Lincoln man has been selling it from a temporary stall in the shopping centre for the past few weeks. He claimed the company had successfully sold the product at the Clothes Show in Birmingham and said he had received 'plenty of support' from customers in Grimsby . However, one parent, who did not wish to be named, said: 'If my 10-year-old came home from town telling me she had bought this drink, I don't know what I'd do. 'It's disgusting that somebody has authorised them to sell it.' 'Kids are going to see the name. It is obviously not cocaine but it is misleading for young people,' she added. She has made a formal complaint to the Freshney Place and the centre now says Mr Kenneth's temporary trading licence would not be renewed. Centre director Amanda Austin said: 'We can confirm that Cocaine Ltd is trading here on a trial basis and this will come to an end on June 22. A picture taken from the energy drink's website. The company claims the product has an anti-drugs message . 'Customer satisfaction is very important to us. The team at Freshney Place has listened to customer feedback regarding Cocaine Ltd, and have therefore decided not to renew the company's temporary trading licence at the centre.' 'Although the brand name is Cocaine Ltd, the company's intention is to promote a positive message about the dangers of taking illegal substances and of anti-social behaviour, by retailing quality products including an energy drink. Following a complaint, the shopping centre decided not to renew the company's temporary trading licence . 'They aim to deliver positive awareness and equip the new generation with knowledge about these issues. 'Whilst we appreciate this, we are also aware that the brand name has caused concern amongst some of our shoppers and we'd like to reassure customers that this was not the intention of the centre, and also extend our apologies for any concern caused.' Mr Kenneth said that far from glorifying the drug cocaine, the product was trying to push people away from the social pressures behind illegal substances. He said his firm did not sell the drink to anyone under 16. 'The point of the name is using the brand to create awareness of not dying young, but getting high on life, rather than glamourising drugs,' he said. He said he wanted to raise awareness of the dangers of substances as well as of unprotected sex, the consequences of unplanned pregnancies and the dangers of anti-social behaviour and crime. 'The more you become aware of the dangers, the less likely you are to get yourself into difficulties. 'The name is what we need to grab people's attention. I have no concerns at all and people have been understanding. 'Drugs are taken because of social pressures and we are raising awareness of playing it safe because of the dangers of illegal substances.'","The drink was on sale at a busy shopping centre in a Lincolnshire town .

"By . Sean Poulter . Millions of GM insects developed by British scientists could be released into food crop fields without proper safety checks, it is claimed. The British company Oxitec is working on genetically modified insects that are designed to kill off pests that feed on crops such as cabbages, broccoli, tomatoes and fruit. The firm insists the technology is a green alternative to the use of chemical sprays, which have their own dangers for human health and the countryside. The Diamondback Moth could be the first first insect to be genetically modified then released into the wild in Britain . Oxitec has already developed a number of GM insects, including moths and mosquitoes. Its technology involves inserting a . lethal gene into male insects which are then released in large numbers . to mate with their wild female counterparts. This gene is passed on to any . resulting offspring, such as caterpillars, which die quickly before . attacking vegetable crops, so boosting farm yields and profits. It accused critics of scaremongering and said there is zero chance of its insects being used on farms without thorough checks on all aspects of their safety. However, a new report from GM critics and public interest groups argues food watchdogs in Britain, Europe and beyond are failing to put in place a thorough testing and safety regime. They warn, for example, that the larvae of these GM insects could get in to human food on vegetables and fruit without any checks on the risk to health. Oxitec has already developed a number of GM insects, including moths and mosquitoes. Its technology involves inserting a lethal gene into male insects which are then released in large numbers to mate with their wild female counterparts. This gene is passed on to any resulting offspring, such as caterpillars, which die quickly before attacking vegetable crops, so boosting farm yields and profits. The firm has had talks with the food and farming department DEFRA and Britain’s Health and Safety Executive(HSE) about trials with GM diamondback moths, which are designed to kill off pests that feed on cabbages. The company has already run trials in the Cayman Islands, Brazil and Malaysia where millions of its GM mosquitoes have been released in an effort to reduce the wild population which is responsible for spreading Dengue fever to humans. The coalition of public interest groups challenging the effectiveness of the safety regime includes GeneWatch UK, TestBiotech, SwissAid, Berne Declaration, and Corporate Europe Observatory. The group complained: ‘Plans to commercialise GM insects would result in many millions of GM insects being released in fields of crops, including olives, tomatoes, citrus fruits, cabbages and cotton. 'In future, any insect species might be genetically modified.’ They claim that Oxitec has lobbied to ensure that experts who support the use of GM insects have been appointed to . key committees set up by the European Food Safety Authority(EFSA). Up close: The diamondback moth's eye. Researchers hope to genetically modify it to kill wild moths which attack crops . These committees are responsible for designing the policing regime for the controversial technology. As a result, they fear that the system will not be sufficiently rigorous to protect public health and the environment. Dr Helen Wallace, the director of GeneWatch UK said: ‘The public will be shocked to learn that GM insects can be released into the environment without any proper oversight. 'Conflicts-of-interest should be removed from all decision-making processes to ensure the public have a proper say about these plans.’ Christoph Then(correct), Executive Director, Testbiotech, said: ‘Risk assessment of genetically engineered animals touches many areas where there is lack of knowledge. 'We are concerned that EFSA will apply a biased and selective protocol to safety without really sorting out potential hazards.’ Tina Goethe, SwissAid, said: ‘The development of GM-insects for agriculture implies unforeseeable risks for human health and environment. In order to meet the challenges of small scale agriculture in poor countries, we do not need expensive and high risk technologies, but agro-ecological solutions.’ Oxitec chief executive, Hadyn Parry, accused the groups of scaremongering. ‘To assert that a small company of our size can bias and subvert regulatory processes around the world in some kind of Machiavellian way is pure conspiracy theory nonsense,’ he said. ‘We are a company with a high scientific reputation and we hope people will see what we are doing in terms of the protection of human health. There are also huge environmental benefits in terms of the reduction of pesticide use.’ The researchers have also created GM Mosquitos . He said Oxitec’s safety testing is very similar to the controlled clinical trials used to test and approve new medicines. ‘It is complete nonsense to suggest that GM insects could be released without a proper safety assessment,’ he said. ‘Decisions on whether, when and how to introduce new technological advances - of whatever type - should go through the proper channels and regulatory systems. Each product should be judged on its merits and the benefits and risks assessed.’ DEFRA insists it has made no decisions on whether to allow GM insect field trials and that it will be guided by experts who sit on ACRE, the Advisory Committee on Releases to the Environment. However, the department has a record of supporting biotechnology and is lobbying in the EU for a speeding up of the approval system for GM crops.","British company Oxitec is working on .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A sprawling waterfront Greenwich, Connecticut estate sold for an astonishing $120 million on Friday, the largest sum ever paid for a home in America. That means its 12 bedrooms come in at $10 million each, but the anonymous buyer also gets two of his or her own islands in the Long Island Sound to sweeten the deal. The 13,000-square-foot mansion called Copper Beech Farm also features a 75-foot pool, grass tennis court and stone carriage house. $10M per bedroom: A 12-bedroom Greenwich mansion sold Friday for the record-breaking sum of $120 million--apparently enough dough to buy palm trees even in chilly Connecticut . Posh: The 50-acre waterfront estate features a 75-foot pool, two islands in Long Island Sound, a stone carriage house and a grass tennis court . Seaside: The home once belonged to Andrew Carnegie's niece and originally listed last May for an even more jaw-dropping $190 million . While it's original listing price was . an even more astonishing $190 million, real estate agent David Ogilvy . tells the Greenwich Time he believes the sum is the most ever paid for a . residential property in the United States. 'I'll . tell you a secret,' he said after the historic closing Friday. 'This is . also the most expensive property sold in America. The . next-most-expensive sold for $117 million in California.' That 9-acre Silicon Valley estate featuring an 8,900-square-foot mansion sold in January 2013. Copper Beech Farm was built in 1896 and was once owned by Andrew Carnegie's niece Harriet Lauder Greenway. Like many homes in tony Greenwich, Copper Beech was purchased through a limited liability corporation to protect the privacy of its new owner. Ogilvy would say only that the buyer is not local. Video Source YouTube . Outdated: The house maintains much of its 1896 charm, from speaking tubes to sleeping porches . Re-decorating: Buyers should have enough money in reserve to bring in an interior designer to update the dated decor . According to a July 2013 New York Times . report, the $120 million selling price is actually less than the . mountains of mortgages previous owner John Rudey had on the property. Mr Rudey owns timber companies, and when some of his lands ran into problems producing timber, Copper Beech suffered. Mr Rudey bought the property with his . wife Laurie in 1982 for 7.55million and took out mortgages every so often to . finance the estate. But in 2006 the amounts drastically shot up. Mrs . Rudey took out a $59 million mortgage on the estate in 2006 with Bank . of America, and the loan was personally guaranteed by both Rudeys. Before that mortgage, there was already a $41 million mortgage with M&T Bank. It was around this time that Mr Rudey's timber companies started to hit hot water. Estate: Much of the home's value is in the fifty acres of land and more than a mile of waterfront property . Staff quarters: The main kitchen is located in the basement - an inconvenience for modern families who might want to cook for themselves . Luxury lifestyle: Other amenities include a heated pool, tennis court, solarium and a formal garden . At . the start of the 2000s one of Mr Rudey's companies purchased $60 million . in forest land in Kittias County, Washington, but the area ended up not . producing much timber because of the presence of the endangered Spotted . Owl and an infestation of spruce budworm. The area has become a popular second-home destination, but plans to develop the area into neighborhoods never happened. In 2006 Mr Rudey was hit with another obstacle - one of his companies in Oregon went bankrupt. At . the end of 2010 the Rudey family's $59 million mortgage on a part of . Copper Beech was cross-collateralized with a $79 million mortgage on the . Washington forestland, both with Bank of America. If . the Rudeys fell behind on payments it meant the bank could sell either . property and if they came up short, the Rudey's would be liable. In . addition to that mortgage, they had $65 million in mortgages on another . part of Copper Beech through M&T Bank, bringing the total debt on . the estate to $203 million. Foreclosure . proceedings on Bank of America's portion of Copper Beech started in . 2011, but the Rudey's filed a suit against the bank claiming 'predatory . lending practices,' and the following summer the suits were dropped. Fixer upper: The house was put on the market for a record-breaking $190million, but the interiors could do with an update . Lots of room: The house includes 15,000 feet of living space and 12 bedrooms . Proper garden: The land is maintained by a horticulturalist with the New York Botanical Garden . Privacy: The house is set back from the road and accessed by a 1,800 foot-long driveway .","The Greenwich home called Copper Beech Farm sits on 50 acres and originally listed for $190 million .

"By . Mark Prigg . Driven by exceptionally warm ocean waters, Earth smashed a record for heat in May and is likely to keep on breaking high temperature marks, experts say. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Monday said May's average temperature on Earth of 59.93 degrees Fahrenheit (15.54 degrees Celsius) beat the old record set four years ago. However, California is having a record hot first five months of the year, a full 5 degrees above normal. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Monday said May's average temperature on Earth of 59.93 degrees Fahrenheit (15.54 degrees Celsius) beat the old record set four years ago. El Niño refers to a set of conditions when the surface of the sea in an area along the Equator in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean becomes hotter than usual. The average water temperature in that area is typically between 1 and 3°C (approximately 2 and 5°F) warmer than normal during this event. This has the effect of adding huge amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere, ultimately affecting patterns of air pressure and rainfall across the Pacific and globally. Strong El Niño events occur every 20 years or so, but researchers recently said this could drop to 10 years thanks to global warming. At the opposite end of the scale, La Niña is the climatological counterpart to El Niño. La Niña refers to periods when sea-surface temperatures around the Equator are cooler than normal. This has a similar affect on air pressure and rainfall because it suppresses how much heat and moisture enters the atmosphere. May was especially hot in parts of Kazakhstan, Indonesia, Spain, South Korea and Australia, while the United States was not close to a record, just 1 degree warmer than the 20th century average. In April, the globe tied the 2010 record for that month. Records go back to 1880. Georgia Tech climate scientist Kim Cobb and other experts say there's a good chance global heat records will keep falling, especially next year because an El Nino weather event is brewing on top of man-made global warming. An El Nino is a warming of the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean that alters climate worldwide and usually spikes global temperatures. Ocean temperatures in May also set a record for the month. But an El Nino isn't considered in effect till the warm water changes the air and that hasn't happened yet, NOAA said. With the El Nino on top of higher temperatures from heat-trapping greenhouse gases, 'we will see temperature records fall all over the world,' wrote Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann in an email . A mahout and his elephant heading towards the River Tawi on a hot day in Jammu:Large regions across north India have been experiencing a heat wave for days. May was 1.33 degrees (0.74 degrees Celsius) warmer than the 20th century world average. The last month that was cooler than normal was February 1985, marking 351 hotter than average months in a row. This possibly could quiet people claiming global warming has stopped, but more importantly it 'should remind everyone that global warming is a long-term trend,' Princeton University climate scientist Michael Oppenheimer said. Setting or tying monthly global heat records has happened frequently in recent years. The last global monthly cold record was set in December 1916. Spring, which is March through May, was the second warmest on record globally, behind only 2010. Thijs Talluto, 3, of Los Angeles, cooling-off in a fountain at Grand Park in downtown Los Angeles.

"By . Sam Webb . A paedophile suspected of abducting Madeleine McCann has been linked with attacks on another five British girls. They include a ten-year-old who was sexually assaulted in Praia da Luz two years before three-year-old Madeleine vanished from the resort in the Algarve, British police revealed yesterday. The attack took place in the ‘heart of the resort’ in 2005 but the victim, now thought to be 19, did not tell her parents at the time. Scroll down for video . She only came forward following an appeal by Scotland Yard last month about a lone sex offender already thought to have targeted 12 British families holidaying in the region between 2004 and 2010. Their apartments were broken into and five young girls were assaulted in their beds by a predator who police believe may be a local binman described as ‘smelly and pot-bellied’. Since the appeal six other British families have come forward to report that their children aged six to 12 fell victim to the offender over the same period. Five of those children – including the ten-year-old molested in Praia da Luz – were sexually assaulted and there was one ‘near miss’ when the intruder was disturbed in neighbouring resorts. Police have received 500 calls about the mystery man said to have ‘a vile interest in young, white, female children’. The latest development comes as police . announced that they are about to begin ‘operational activity’ on the . ground in Portugal, raising hopes that arrests could be imminent. Detectives . are preparing to fly out to Portugal in the next fortnight in a move . which will coincide with the anniversary of Madeleine’s disappearance. The investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann may have taken a step forward after British police announced they expect to start a new operation in Portugal soon . They . hope to be able to arrest and quiz suspects but any formal interviews . will be conducted by Portuguese police with Met officers sitting in. After months of stalling, the Portuguese authorities are set to give the go-ahead by the end of the week on three letters of request from Scotland Yard which are thought to include the questioning and arrest of suspects. Detectives hope the breakthrough will mean British and Portuguese officers can act within days. Three incidents took place in Praia de Luz - between 2005 and 2010 . Five incidents took place in Carvoeiro between 2004 and 2006 . Nine incidents took place in the Praia de Gale, Vale de Parra, Sao Rafeal (Albuferia district) between 2004 and 2008 . One incident took place in Vilamoura in 2005, a new offence which has come to light since the March appeal . But they have still to agree a timescale with the Portuguese authorities which have refused to mount a joint investigation with their British counterparts, preventing Scotland Yard detectives from carrying out their own activities in Portugal. It emerged yesterday that the Portuguese have already snubbed a number of requests from Scotland Yard’s Operation Grange set up in 2011 to investigate the toddler’s disappearance. One key thing detectives want to establish is if there are any local police files on the break-ins, now totalling 18, of British tourists’ apartments around the Algarve. Astonishingly, local police knew about 14 of them at the time of Madeleine’s disappearance, but dismissed any link as they were spread over a wide area and there were no attempts to abduct the children targeted. Detective Chief Inspector Andy Redwood said the attack on the ten-year-old girl was particularly significant because it ‘now takes us into’ Praia da Luz. Madeleine disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment on May 3, 2007, as her parents Kate and Gerry dined at a nearby restaurant.

When Christopher Alvelo's step-father blacked out while driving Saturday, he unbuckled his seat belt and grabbed the wheel, steering the SUV clear of a tanker truck full of jet fuel it was about to hit. The 17-year-old's actions saved the lives of his step-father, the two other Boy Scouts in the back of the SUV and the driver of the fuel truck, his family says. Scroll down for video . Bright future: Christopher Alvelo, 17, wanted to join the Air Force after high school and had just completed his final project to become an Eagle Scout . This is the mangled Ford SUV that Alvelo was riding in when he took the wheel and steered it away from a fuel truck . Hard work: Alvelo is seen here working at the park that was his final service project before he became an Eagle Scout . Because he wasn't wearing a seat belt, he was killed on impact after the SUV smashed into a hanger at the Northeast Philadelphia Airport. Alvelo was a beloved student at New Foundations Charter School in Philadelphia with a promising future ahead of him. He planned to join the Air Force after he graduated this spring. And no one was surprised he used his final moments on Earth to save lives. 'That's Chris. That's all I can say, that's Chris. He saved lives and he was a hero,' his aunt Susie Formeski told WCAU-TV.

Alvelo's step-father Joseph Snyder, 51, . was taken to the hospital in critical condition, but is expected to . survive. The two other Scouts were treated for minor injuries. Foremski told the Philadelphia Inquirer that Snyder was driving Alvelo and two other Scouts home from a morning of cleaning up a city park. It was the last project Alvelo needed to complete before he could be promoted to Eagle Scout - the highest rank in scouting. It was an achievement was the result of years of hard work and dedication to the Boy Scouts. And it was just another outstanding aspect of Alevelo's short life, his friends and family say. 'He was a gentleman's gentleman. If you have a son, you wanted him to be your son, and if you had a daughter, you wanted him to date your daughter,' his principal Bill Schilling said.","Christopher Alvelo, 17, grabbed the steering wheel and narrowly avoided a jet fuel tanker truck after his step-father passed out while driving .

"By . Hayley Peterson . Celeste Corcoran says she prayed for death as excruciating pain ripped through her body in the first chaotic seconds after the initial bomb went off at the Boston Marathon. But Celeste's husband, Kevin Corcoran, refused to let her go. He tore off his belt and wrapped it around one of her legs, making a tourniquet, then asked a stranger for his belt to stop the bleeding from her other leg. 'I just wanted to die,' Celeste, 47, recalled in an interview with Natalie Morales of NBC's Today Show. 'The thought was there  because I was in so much pain. And then I just remember thinking - I can’t. I can’t. I don’t wanna leave my family... There’s still too much to do.' Scroll down for video . Hero: Kevin Corcoran, right, saved the life of his wife, second right, by tying his belt around her leg and using a stranger's belt on her other leg. Also pictured are the couple's daughter, Sydney, and son . Recovery: Mother Celeste, left, and daughter Sydney, right, have been recovering together in the hospital. They said they couldn't stop crying when they were reunited . Meanwhile, Celeste and Kevin's daughter, 18-year-old Sydney Corcoran, was lying on the ground with dire wounds to her leg. She had become separated from her parents in the blasts. Two strangers rushed to help her - one created a tourniquet around her injured leg that ended up saving her life while the other tried to keep her alert as the color drained from her face. 'From the moment I got in the ambulance I wanted to know where they were,' Sydney said of parents, her eyes welling with tears. 'I thought I was going to wake up and have no one left but my brother.' Celeste, who lost both her legs, and Sydney, who suffered severe nerve damage, are now recovering in the same hospital room. When they were reunited after the blasts, they said they couldn't stop crying. 'I couldnt get close enough to her,' Celeste said. Fears: Sydney Corcoran said she thought she was going to wake up afte surgery and find out that her parents were dead . Family: Sydney Corcoran and her mother Celeste comfort each other in their hospital beds . Comforting her daughter in this time of healing has been difficult because she feels physically limited, she said. 'Normally I'm hugging her and not being able to physically get up and go to her has been really hard,' she said. Sydney explained how the doctors prepared her for seeing her mother's injuries just before their reunion. 'Right before they brought her in they made sure they told me [about her injuries] so I wouldn't be in shock more than I already was,' she said. 'So I was a little prepared and honestly, the shock wasn't bad at all because I knew I at least had my mother.' Sydney, who celebrated her 18th birthday in the hospital this week, also talked about reunited with the man who kept her alert as another stranger dressed her wounds. Long road ahead: Celeste said comforting her daughter in this time of healing has been difficult because she feels physically limited . Tragedy: Sydney Corcoran, 18, left, suffered shrapnel wounds, including a torn femoral artery. Sydney's mother, Celeste, right, lost both her legs below the knee . Sydney Corcoran meets with the man who kept her alert as she lost massive amounts of blood in the terrifying moments after the blasts . 'I wanted to find him and meet him and thank him,' she said. 'He was just holding my gaze the entire time, getting right up in my face, he kept calling me ""buddy"" and kept saying I would be okay and to stay with him and keep my eyes open. It was really difficult, just feeling so tired because all of the blood. My lips turned blue.' The man who saved her visited her in the hospital and she said it was a very emotional moment. 'The moment I saw him walk through that door and just, I just looked at him and I knew it was him, I just started crying, and he got teary-eyed and came over and hugged me and he was grabbing my hand.' Since the moments she prayed for death to relieve her pain, Celeste said she has adopted a much more positive outlook on her injuries. 'There's times when everything just kind of overwhelms you but... I know in my heart that I'm going to be okay,' Celeste said. 'As long as I'm strong enough or want it enough, I will have a different life, a different reality... you really have to dig down deep inside and just be like, ""I can do this."" It’s going to be hard, but I can do this.' Recovery: Both Sydney (right) and her mother Celeste (center) are still recovering . Looking up: Since the moments she prayed for death to relieve her pain, Celeste said she has adopted a much more positive outlook on her injuries .

Eight people have been hospitalised in the past week in Darwin after ingesting the drug SnapChat . Police warn the pill, sold in either pink or blue with green speckles, is popular with teenagers . Named after the smartphone photo-messaging app, Snapchat, the pill is sold in either pink or blue with green speckles and has the app’s ghost logo pressed on the top of the tablet, which has become popular with teenagers. Police are expressing grave concern about the drug, which is causing people to behave in an erratic and irrational manner and causing aggressive and disoriented behaviour. Drug and Organised Crime Division Superintendent Clint Sims said taking any illicit drug is dangerous and potentially deadly. ‘These drugs are not produced under pharmaceutical conditions and the reality is people have no idea what they are taking or worse, what affect it will have on them,’ he told MailOnline. ‘The adverse and aggressive reactions people experience also places enormous pressure on emergency services.’ Police urge anyone who may have ingested the drug to seek medical treatment.

The trench, the work of the Kurdistan Regional Government, is thought to be 11 miles (17 kilometres) long, two yards deep and three yards wide. It has been reported that smugglers have started to operate in the border areas as they became insecure with Syrian authorities losing control of them.

"By . Mia De Graaf . Police have been taught to speak Roma in a bid to control tensions in a community flooded by thousands of Eastern European migrants. Page Hall in Sheffield has been the scene of violent clashes between rival groups of immigrants and locals for months. Last month, former Home Secretary David Blunkett called for urgent and tough police action in the borough - part of his constituency - to avoid riots. Scroll down for video . Integration: A team of nine police officers in Page Hall, Sheffield, have been deployed to help handle tensions between Roma and Slovak migrants. They are patrolling streets and learning to speak Roma . Now, a nine-strong team of officers has been enrolled in Roma lessons in the first of many integration measures. In a bespoke five-week language learning camp, the team went through basic phrases, verb conjugations, and key vocabulary. They also covered cultural references to help them connect with the district's newer residents. Operating from a new permanent base in the community, they will also be patrolling the streets seven days a week in a bid to engage with the community. A spokesman for South Yorkshire Police . said: 'The community in Page Hall is made up of diverse residents, some . of which do not speak English. 'A . key part of a police team's job is to engage and work with the . community it serves to discuss any concerns they have and to work with . them to tackle any issues that arise. Page Hall started to see an influx of Roma migrants when Slovakia joined the EU in 2004. Last year, the council estimated 1,500 eastern European Roma residents live in Sheffield . Around 500-900 live in the small Page Hall area. That figure has been revised up by hundreds since the Government relaxed immigration rules in January, joining the EU's move to allow all European citizens free movement. 'In order to do this, we must be able to speak to local residents - which can be a challenge when a person cannot speak English. 'To help stregthen our relationship with the Roma community in Page Hall, the dedicated police team there have learned the basics of their language so that issues can be dealt with more quickly and to allow our officers to better engage with residents. 'The impact this has had has been overwhelming. Simply being able to speak directly with people in a language they understand has allowed us to build trust and relationships between police and those who live and work in in the area.' Tensions in the district came to a head last month when more than 25 Roma and Slovak residents got into a street fight. A 17-year-old boy broke his arm in the brawl, watched by dozens of residents lining the streets. Mr . Blunkett said at the time: 'We were all very apprehensive about the . emergence of the long warmer nights, and recognise this was going to be a . moment of pressure. 'The . police have devoted sufficient manpower and expertise, but what is . required is a clear, visible presence in the evening, so there’s no . doubt in anyone’s mind about the determination to clamp down on any kind . of unacceptable behaviour. Outbursts: Police were called to a street fight in Page Hall involving at least 25 people last month . 'It’s . fine having the numbers but they have to be there at the right time. Those who perpetrate unacceptable behaviour need to understand the . police mean business. 'The cause of the problem is believing they can behave in this fashion.' Since, Eric . Pickles, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government, haspledged to support the community and work with the local police in integration measures. Residents welcomed the government support. Gail Sharrod, 45, who has lived in . Page Hall for six years, said: 'The area has changed over recent years . and we now have people hanging around on the streets. 'But I think it is turning a corner with the police here all the time now. Action: David Blunkett (left), MP for Sheffield, said urgent and tough police action is needed to avoid riots in the district, which Eric Pickles (right), Local Communities Secretary, has now pledged to deliver . 'There used to be big groups hanging around, and young kids on the streets at all times of the day and night, but it’s not as bad these days. I hope that continues.' Inspector Chris Lewis, who runs the new policing team, said: 'The police are working in partnership in Page Hall to address underlying issues, deemed necessary to alleviate any problems or difficulties. 'Very few of the issues are police related - crime is actually very low - but everyone working here appreciates we need a joined-up approach to get to the root cause of issues if we are to address and resolve them. 'Everything is about raising standards - improving housing, cleaning up the streets, creating more open space, providing more recreational opportunities - helping people to take pride in the area.'","Nine-strong team in Page Hall, Sheffield, have been enrolled in Roma lessons .

"By . Meghan Keneally . It has been revealed that the Census Department may have faked the jobs report in the final month of the 2012 presidential campaign. Unnamed Census employees are said to have inflated their reports for the national employment figures for last September, which would have attributed to why the unemployment rate dropped from 8.1 per cent in August to 7.8 per cent in September. A columnist for The New York Post claims that he spoke with an unidentified source who says that there are a number of Census employee who falsifying the monthly numbers. Working for him: There are new reports that Census Bureau employees may have inflated their findings in surveys about the national unemployment rates, which could have helped President Obama in 2012 . The way that the closely-watched unemployment rate is determined is by having members of the Census Bureau interview 60,000 households from across the country about their job status. The Labor Department requires that in order to submit a set of results for one of the six regions of the country that are surveyed, they have to have a 90 per cent success rate, meaning that for every 10 numbers dialed, they need to speak to someone about their job status on nine of those calls. Julius Buckmon was named as a Census Department employee who was fired in 2010 for bolstering the numbers by saying that he spoke to more people than he actually did. Mr Buckmon, who was working specifically in the New York and Philadelphia region, had not been hitting the 90 per cent mark but he reportedly had a conversation with a superior who said it was not a problem. Final days: The most dramatic instance is said to be in September 2012 which came at a critical point in Mitt Romney's presidential campaign (seen here with his wife Ann before giving his concession speech) 'It was a phone conversation — I forget the exact words — but it was, ""Go ahead and fabricate it"" to make it what it was,' Mr Buckmon told The Post's John Crudele. Mr Buckmon had been fired by the time President Obama was facing re-election, but The Post columnist says that he spoke to a source who told him the inflation of reports remained a problem long after he left. 'He's not the only one,' the source told Mr Crudele. He goes on to claim that the problem 'escalated' towards the end of the campaign, but gives not specific reasons why the September 2012 figures have been singled out. That shift- from 8.1 per cent to 7.8 per cent- was the most dramatic drop through all of 2012. It undoubtedly helped President Obama during the final weeks of the campaign against former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney.","There has been a history of Census Bureau employees inflating the numbers that they report when surveying Americans .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Online dating can be a virtual minefield sprinkled with piranhas, so in order to avoid the pitfalls and heartbreak, Chinese singles are now drawing their perfect partners. The new trend, called ViFriends, sees lonely hearts create an online relationship that exist only on the photographs that they create to show how they imagine their perfect partner to be. Using ViFriends, young single Chinese men and women take snaps in situations where they can imagine they would like to be seen with their other half. Made(up) for each other: A young Chinese woman and her pretend partner hold hands in the street . Movie night: A bachelor hoping his lonely days are over creates a girlfriend to hold his hand through the horror flick . Dinner for two: To avoid the humiliation of eating alone, this Chinese single has made up a lunch companion . They then simply add their virtual boyfriend to the pictures later on, creating images that they share on social network sites and with pals. The craze started in southeast China’s Fujian province when Hsin Hsu and Cai Lu, both single, came up with the idea of sending images of their dream partner in romantic situations. Cai said: ‘It was somehow really comforting to have these images of a strongman by my side and to share some special moments together even if it was only virtually. 'I showed them with friends and we chat about them for ages and it just kind of took off from there.’ Happy birthday to me: One Chinese man never has to celebrate his special day alone again after 'meeting' a ViFriend . For(n)ever alone: The new ViFriends trend sees young Chinese 'add' their partners on photographs . Fake boyfriend: A young Chinese woman goes shopping with her gentleman boyfriend, who even - somehow - holds an umbrella for her to keep her dry . Datenight: The girl then has a romantic dinner with her 'boyfriend' Bedtime story: One person has drawn a 'girlfriend' with tired eyes in a bedroom . Although there has been criticism of the ViFriends idea, users say sending snaps with ViFriends is much healthier than sending intimate photographs or any of the other unhealthy practices that people use on the Internet. And in some way it's really comforting to have a partner even if it's only one in a virtual photograph illustrating how the dream relationship should really be. Cai said: ‘We are fans of cartoons and the photos are real, we just pose as if we are there with a lover and then use the computer to draw the  lover into the photos. ‘We eat, walk, shop, and do everything with our imagined lovers, it's almost as good as the real thing and brings a lot of pleasure.’ 'Lol, bae caught me': A selfie becomes a 'couplie' after a few moments on the drawing board . The other side of love: Another ViFriend appears to have a girlfriend trapped inside a mobile phone . 'Sad girlfriend': A man appears to be trying to cheer up his sad ViFriend with a dumpling . Bathtime: Had she been a real girlfriend that bathtub would probably have been a bit cramped - fortunately for the lonely single she is just a drawing!","Lonely Chinese men and women are drawing their perfect partner .

"By . Talal Musa . Published: . 11:30 EST, 16 January 2013 . | . Updated: . 15:33 EST, 16 January 2013 . Aliens: Colonial Marines is fast-approaching, so MailOnline caught up with Brian Burleson, Senior Producer for the game, to see what fans can expect. Tell us about the game? What is the story and what can we expect? Brian: 'Aliens: Colonial Marines is the canonical video game sequel of the Aliens films which that takes place 17 weeks after the events of Aliens. 'The United States Colonial Marines are investigating a distress signal that was sent out from the Sulaco, the original ship from the film which was reported missing between the events of Aliens and Alien 3. They're coming through the ceiling! Aliens will work in packs to try and take down your team . 'They find it in orbit over LV-426, the last place it should be since it’s the very planet that it was supposed to have left at the end of Aliens. Something horrible is on that ship. 'The game starts here with Corporal Winter, one the last marines woken from hypersleep, boarding the Sulaco to find out what happened on the ship as well as what happened to the marines who had boarded the ship prior to him. 'At this point, all hell breaks loose and the player is faced with all the horrors and action seen in the Aliens films with some new twists.' It’s obviously a first-person shooter, but have you incorporated many set-pieces? Are there any vehicles to drive? Brian: 'The Aliens universe is very rich with amazing sets, vehicles, weapons, and more. When we started working on ACM we talked about what would be the most exciting things to include from the universe and got to work. 'When you play the game you will fight through the iconic areas seen in Aliens such as the Sulaco, Hadley’s Hope, the surface of LV-426, the iconic Derelict, and more, as wells as explore parts of these locations you never got to see in the films. 'One of the designers we worked with who worked on the original Aliens, Syd Mead, helped us take the original set designs of the film and expand them out. 'When you start working on and Aliens game, and you want to do it right, you have to talk with the people who started it all! 'As far as vehicles go, you’ll have to play the game to see. You’ll be pleasantly surprised.' New faces: Gearbox have developed the new breeds of Xenomorph carefully as to not jar with the universe . What is your favourite moment from Aliens? Have you tried to incorporate this into the game? Brian: 'I have a lot of favorite moments. Mine has to be when the marines are in Hadley’s Hope’s Operations setting up the defenses and the power gets cut by the Xenomorphs.  The suspense, horror and action of that scene is amazing. These three things pretty much sum up ACM. Aliens boasted some strong female characters. Will we see this in Colonial Marines? Brian: 'Most certainly. One of the characters in the player’s squad, Bella, is a pivotal character in the story of ACM. I don’t want to spoil too much, but when the player finds her, she is terminal.  Where that goes from there and how she handles it is very much keeping with the strong female characters of the Aliens universe. There are new aliens on show in the game. What steps did you take to ensure  fans of the films were happy with the designs? Brian: 'ACM does feature some new Xenomorphs that we haven’t seen before in the Aliens universe. Since ACM is canonical, we had to be very careful with how we handled that. 'Fans have always been very interested in knowing how Xenos work and how ours fit into the whole scheme of things. When we were creating them we stuck with Cameron’s view on the Aliens species, which is that of a hive hierarchy. Short, controlled bursts: The Pulse Rife is effective at most ranges, but accuracy is affected if you simply hold down the trigger . 'In Aliens we saw the Queen, soldiers, praetorians, and in Alien we saw what we call a scout. These are the Xenomorphs we started with. 'So when gameplay dictated the need for a new type of combat challenge for the player, we designed the new Xenomorphs with the hive hierarchy in mind. 'When we look at ant hives, bee hives, or termite nests, they have a lot more roles than just these.  Looking at nature, you realize how scary it can be, so we started there. 'When players play the game, they will learn how our Xenomorphs fit into this hive, but we don’t want to give away all the secrets of the Aliens universe. We have to leave some things a mystery.'

"By . David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor . Less than a day after former IRS official Lois Lerner was found in criminal contempt of Congress, her old agency has agreed to turn over copies of all her emails and other correspondence to one of the Republican-led House committees investigating the scandal that led to her retirement. The agency's quick concession came after Wednesday night's 231-178 contempt vote, which closely followed the passage of a second resolution demanding the appointment of a nonpartisan 'special counsel' at the Department of Justice. Lerner has twice refused to answer questions in congressional hearings after lawmakers issued a subpoena for her appearance. 'This is ALL Lerner documents,' a House Ways and Means Committee official confirmed to MailOnline. All stick, no carrot: House Ways and Means Chairman Dave Camp warned the IRS he would start firing off subpoenas if it didn't cough up every Lois Lerner-related document it had . Angry tea partiers have rallied at IRS headquarters in Washington with stern warnings about what would happen if the agency doesn't 'produce all the documents'; 'Appeal to Heaven' was a Revolutionary War slogan . Lois Lerner, the former IRS Director of Exempt Organizations, angered Republicans during a 2013 House hearing by offering a self-serving opening statement about her role in the tea party targeting scandal, and then refusing to answer members' questions . 'While it . is good that we are finally getting these emails, it should never have . taken this long,' committee chairman Dave Camp, a Michigan Republican, . said Thursday in a statement. 'The agency is finally doing what is right and . hopefully this is the last of the delays.' 'It . is almost a year to the day since Lois Lerner ""apologized"" for the . IRS’s targeting of conservative groups, and we need to get to the bottom . of this.' Lerner is accused of executing a plan to . hamstring right-leaning nonprofit groups by slow-walking their . applications for tax-exempt status. She ran the Exempt Organizations section of the IRS until her retirement in late 2013. Ways and Means referred her case to the Justice Department for prosecution on April 9, charging that she 'used her position to improperly influence agency action against only conservative organizations, denying these groups due process and equal protection rights under the law.' If she were convicted, Lerner would face a possible 1-year jail term and a fine of up to $100,000. While the politically lopsided scheme was underway, hundreds of tea-party and other like-minded groups were delayed for three years or more, beginning in the run-up to the 2010 midterm congressional elections. Liberal groups, meanwhile, were generally green-lighted quickly. The full House of Representatives voted Wednesday evening to hold Lois Lerner in criminal contempt, in a move led by House Oversight chairman Darrell Issa (C) Conservative activists have urged right-leaning members of Congress to find out who gave the order to target their organizations based on their political beliefs . 'The fish stinks from the head': Tea party activists told MailOnline in 2013 that they blame President Barack Obama for whatever level of corruption is uncovered at the IRS . Camp's Ways and Means Committee and the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform have been probing whether the politically calibrated targeting was ordered from inside the White House. They have already established that the cases of some groups denied tax exemptions were managed in Washington, not in the Cincinnati office where Lerner's subagency was based. Camp warned the IRS in a February 24 letter that he would start issuing subpoenas if the agency didn't turn over the documents he wanted. Weeks later the agency promised it would start delivering – but Thursday's decision covers more Lerner-related documents than Congress has seen to date. Meanwhile, the IRS has proposed a rewrite of its regulations governing communications restrictions on 'public benefit' organizations, like many tea party groups, which are exempt from paying federal income taxes. Republicans have complained that the move merely seeks to cement in regulations what the Obama administration was allegedly doing outside public view.","It's been nearly a year since Congress began investigating allegations that the IRS played political favorites when it vetted nonprofit groups .

Should Andy Murray’s defence of his Wimbledon title this coming fortnight be disappointingly brief then blame should not be laid at the door of his new coach Amelie Mauresmo. The reigning champion discovered on Friday that Belgium’s David Goffin, a neat striker of the ball who looks like he might be  the shy one in a boyband, will be his opponent when he steps out on to Centre Court at 1pm on Monday. And in the unlikely event of the worst happening, he warned against using his mentor  Mauresmo as a scapegoat. ‘I could lose in the first round and it  certainly wouldn’t be her fault,’ said Murray. Scroll down for video... Practice: Defending Wimbledon champion Andy Murray trained with new coach Amelie Mauresmo on Friday . No scapegoat: Andy Murray insists it won't be his new coach's fault if he crashes out early . Taking a breather: Murray looks up at new coach Mauresmo as she chats with him in between practice . ‘You cannot, as a coach, change anything in five or six days. It is silly to suggest otherwise. But what I can sense is whether I feel like things we are working on in practice are the right things, whether I feel like we communicate well, tactics and the way we talk after a match. ‘I have enjoyed the last few days. I don’t think the first few (at Queen’s where he lost in the third round) were the perfect place to start. ‘Every time we were on the practice court and she stood  anywhere near me there were the clicks of a hundred cameras. It is normal to be a bit uptight in those circumstances, especially as we did not know each other well at that stage. ‘Since Queen’s we have managed to get away from everything and spend some time together on court. I had dinner with her on Wednesday night. I suppose the thing that has surprised me is that she has fitted in with the team very quickly.’ Unlike what initially seemed  to be the case 12 months ago, Murray’s early draw looks relatively kind, although 23-year-old Goffin is someone whose natural talent exceeds that of his ranking of 104. He reached Wimbledon’s third round two years ago and defeated Bernard Tomic, who had made the last eight at SW19 12 months before. Goffin will not blast Murray off the court but is a skilled opponent who is attractive to watch — it is to be hoped he does not become this year’s Steve Darcis, the little-known Belgian who took out Rafael Nadal in the 2013 first round.

"By . Julian Robinson . An England fan had his ear bitten off in a vicious attack by another supporter after the national side's World Cup loss to Uruguay. The victim, believed to be England fan Robert Farquharson, was left with blood pouring down his neck after having half of his left ear lobe ripped off by a racist thug in the Arena Corinthians stadium in Sao Paulo, Brazil. The savage attack happened a week before Uruguay and Liverpool striker Luis Suarez was banned from the competition for biting an Italian player - but details of the attack have only just emerged. Scroll down for video . An England fan shows the injuries he suffered when a fellow supporter bit off his left ear lobe . The attack happened after England fans, pictured, had watched Uruguay beat Roy Hodgson's men . A video which appeared on the Sunday People website shows the victim's neck covered in blood after he was set upon by a fellow England fan following the team's 2-1 defeat to Uruguay. With his left ear horrifically injured, he turns and tells the camera: 'He bit my ear off and called me a black ****.' Footage shows a scuffle unfolding in front of shocked supporters in the upper tier block 614 of the stadium. Before long the argument descends into a fierce fight as stewards desperately try to intervene. A man wrapped in England-themed fancy dress clothing tries to move out of the way as the brawl escalates next to him. The frightened victim, who was wearing a white England top and red backpack, was held by one attacker while another appears to repeatedly punch him. Seconds later a man can bee seen sinking his teeth in to the victim's ear as he desperately tries to wriggle free. The video then shows onlookers and stewards trying to push the attackers away. The incident happened before Luis Suarez, pictured left, was banned from the World Cup for biting an Italian player . A voice . can be heard behind the camera saying: 'He's an idiot, take him out' in . reference to the man who carried out the assault. Amongst the confusion, the cameraman then approaches the victim and asks: 'What happened, what happened?' Asking . the victim to display his blood-soaked ear, the cameraman then says: . 'Come here, turn around. That's what he's done to you, man.' Bizarrely, . and despite his injuries, the victim manages a smile as he explains . how his ear was brutally bitten off just seconds earlier. The Sunday People reports that north London-based fan Billy Grant filmed the incident and quote him as saying: 'Everyone who witnessed what happened to the kid was absolutely disgusted. 'The guy who attacked him was an idiot. 'He attacked another England fan, racially abused him and then bit his ear off. It was appalling.' Former . Liverpool striker Stan Collymore tweeted that he had seen footage of . the fan attack and claimed it would be 'the biggest story in the UK, . especially who did it'. Six British police officers travelled to Brazil for the tournament to offer support and advice to local police. Chief . Superintendent Rachel Barber said: 'We were made aware during the . England vs Uruguay match in Sao Paulo that an incident had taken place . which resulted in an England fan having a portion of his ear bitten off . by another England fan.

"By . Ashley Collman . Text messages reveal the bitter row a Pennsylvania couple had just hours before the husband returned home to murder his wife. The text messages were used in the trial of 44-year-old David Stahl, who was found guilty on Friday of first-degree murder for strangling to death wife Rebecca, 37, in February 2012. While Stahl confessed to killing Rebecca, he argued he was just trying to defend himself in a physical fight instigated by his knife-wielding wife. Bad love: David Stahl (right) was found guilty on Friday of murdering his wife Rebecca (left) after a fight in 2012 . Too late: Stahl said he was sorry for killing his wife as he left court on Friday . On February 18, the night of the murder, Rebecca sent her husband a string of angry text messages while recovering at their Greensburg home from a hysterectomy three weeks prior. At 10:38pm on Friday, Rebecca sent a text message reading: 'You must be at the bar now. You can't just be married when you feel like it.' 'I will not be second to the bar,' she wrote five minutes later. Rebecca, a math teacher, continued to send text messages until 11:18pm. 'Don't bother walking in here,' she wrote at one point. 'When you do come for your things, don't be nasty.' A few hours later, Stahl returned home and the two allegedly got into a physical fight when he confronted her about smoking marijuana. Broken home: The deadly fight happened the night of February 18, when Stahl returned home and confronted his wife for smoking marijuana . 'My wife had been smoking marijuana and she was bitter, and I didn't wanna deal with it,' Stahl said in his audio-tapped confession. Stahl says he was walking downstairs when he saw his wife waiting at the bottom, holding a knife. 'I grabbed her arm. I got the knife out of her hand, and we both fell over,' he told police. Stahl ended up strangling his wife by trying to keep her away. 'I didn’t do this intentionally. My hands were around her neck, trying to keep her away from me. I thought she just passed out,' Stahl said. After she died, Stahl says he lay next to Rebecca's body all night. 'I'm sorry it happened. I miss my lovebird,' he said. But prosecutors say Stahl showed no remorse, sadness or grief at losing his wife and instead 'went to play pool and hit the bars'. An autopsy revealed he strangled Rebecca so hard he broke a bone in her neck. At first, Stahl hid his wife's body in a shed, before moving her to abandoned nursery. Over the next few days, Stahl also burned his wife's belongings. On February 24, he dumped Rebecca's naked body in a field near the Arnold Palmer regional airport where it was soon found by police. Thrown out: Stahl dumped his wife's naked body in a field near a local airport in 2012 . State Police Trooper Brian Kendgia testified during the trial, saying he found Stahl wandering the streets in distress shortly after his wife's body was recovered. An accident: Stahl's defense team tried to convince the jury that he killed his wife in self-defense . 'He was muddy and looked discheveled. There were cuts on his wrists.' Police say Stahl tried and failed to commit suicide, and was taken to the hospital for treatment. In his trial last week, Stahl's defense attorney Donna McClelland argued he did not commit murder, but voluntary manslaughter. McClelland also painted Rebecca as a 'pistol' who was capable of getting into a fight with her husband. 'You don't have to like David Stahl, you don't have to respect David Stahl...but you must give him a fair trial,' she told the 12-woman jury. However, after a few hours of deliberation, the jury found Stahl guilty of first degree murder handing down a life sentence without the possibility of parole. Following the decision, Rebecca's brother Tom Anderson issued a statement on behalf of the family, saying his sister was 'treated like garbage at the end of her life'. 'She unfortunately gave her heart to a horrible man who apparently was not taught that a man should never hit a woman under any circumstances.' The couple also had a history of violence. Stahl spent nine to 23 months in prison for a 2007 attack on Rebecca, who was his fiancee at the time. The attack left her with a black eye and a clump of hair pulled from her head.","A Pennsylvania jury found 44-year-old David Stahl guilty of first-degree murder on Friday .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Miss Thomas had died after 'serious failings' by paramedics, and heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections . Two paramedics have been struck off after they told a dying woman to stay at home because she only had a ‘tummy bug’. Hours later Sarah Thomas, 30, was dead because her symptoms were not taken seriously by the pair of ‘incompetent’ ambulance workers who refused to take her to hospital. Paramedic David Glover told her she just had stomach bug even though she was barely conscious and struggling to breathe. Miss Thomas would have survived if she was taken to hospital and given a simple injection, an inquest has already been told. Now a disciplinary hearing has heard that Glover and his colleague Michael Davies then tried to cover up their mistake by fabricating her clinical record. The pair were banned from working as paramedics by a disciplinary panel of the Health and Care Professions Council. Panel chair Ian Crookall said: ‘The public would be appalled at the lack of competence. ‘The facts of the case would undermine public confidence in the profession in the eyes of any member of the public who was aware of the circumstances.’ He went on: ‘When there is a case of proven dishonesty it is necessary to uphold regulatory standards by demonstrating that such behaviour is not acceptable.’ Miss Thomas was visited at her home in Port Talbot, South Wales, by the two paramedics following a 999 call. Glover and Davies, (not pictured) who were working for the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, 'colluded to fabricate a patient record' (picture posed by models) But a Health and Care Professions Council hearing was told how Glover failed check her vital signs including pulse, breathing and blood oxygenation. The dental nurse had diabetes and her pituitary gland had been removed after surgery for a brain tumour. An inquest earlier this year found that Miss Thomas had died after ‘serious failings’ by paramedics, and heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections. But the hearing in Cardiff was told that Glover failed to ask suitable questions about her medical history before her death in May 2007. He told her: ‘You just have a stomach bug. You are better off here Sarah, this is the best place for you.’ But the patient died just six hours later of adrenal insufficiency - when her body stopped producing the necessary steroid hormones. Glover and Davies, who were working for the Welsh Ambulance Service NHS Trust, then ‘colluded to fabricate a patient record’ the hearing was told. The pair added information they got later from another paramedic in an attempt to cover up their failures. Mr Crookall added: ‘The panel was of the view that the established failure to conduct a proper assessment. ‘The subsequent dishonest fabrication and collusion are very serious, representing a disregard for fundamental and core duties. ‘It had the potential of causing very significant degree of harm - including death.’ The inquest in February this year heard Miss Thomas was battling the after-effects of a brain tumour when an ambulance was called. Coroner Philip Rogers said then: ‘There were serious failings in the way in which the crew went about their assessment and recording her condition that night.’ He added: ‘If Sarah had been taken to hospital it was likely she would have received intravenous hydrocortisone injections and fluids, and her death would not have occurred. ‘But given the crew’s lack of knowledge and the rarity of Sarah’s condition, this cannot be labelled as gross failings.’","Sarah Thomas called ambulance after she struggled to breathe .

"By . Hugo Gye . A teenage girl who was tricked into having sex with a woman who pretended to be a schoolboy today spoke of her outrage after learning her abuser had avoided prison. Christine Wilson, 26, seduced two 15-year-olds - but a judge ruled that she deserved a lenient sentence because she genuinely believed that she was in fact male. One of the victims, Megan Adie, said she was 'devastated' by the judgement, and warned that Wilson could prey on others now that she is walking free. She was given three months of probation as well of community service during sentencing at the High Court in Edinburgh. Fury: Megan Adie is outraged after 26-year-old Christine Wilson escaped jail for tricking her into sex by pretending to be a teenage boy . Megan, now 18, regarded Wilson as her 'first love' when they met, and allow the person she thought was a 16-year-old boy to take her virginity. The victim, who has waived her right to anonymity in order to speak out, today said: 'I'm absolutely devastated with the sentence Christine has been given. 'She will be able to go back to her own house and lie in her own bed again. I will also be lying in mine, still trying to deal with what she has done to me. 'I really hope the judge has really thought this sentence through because if Christine does this again, I hope he knows it's on his conscience.' Walking free: Christine Wilson, pictured outside court today, has been sentenced to probation for obtaining sexual intimacy by fraud . Wilson, from Aberdeen, had previously pleaded guilty to two charges of obtaining sexual intimacy by fraud. In 2008, she posed as a 17-year-old boy named Chris and had sexual relations with a teenage girl. 'The complainer believed Wilson to be a . boy aged 17 years old,' a lawyer said at a previous hearing. 'There was sexual contact - initially, kissing and . cuddling but things progressed over the course of the three months.' The girl broke off contact with Wilson after seeing her passport, which was emailed to her by another girl. When Wilson was later interviewed by police, she admitted having a relationship with the girl and . presenting herself as a boy throughout, and accepted that she did not . allow the girl to do anything to her that might disclose her gender. In 2010, the defendant started a relationship with Megan, using a sex toy to persuade her she was a boy aged 16. ‘This was the complainer’s first . experience of what she thought had been sexual intercourse and both . declared their love for each other,' the lawyer said. 'The complainer felt having had sex . with the accused made their relationship stronger. ‘The . complainer had what she believed to be sexual intercourse on one . further conviction. Again this intimacy was described to be under the . covers so they did not see each other naked.’ Megan was devastated to be told by police that her 'boyfriend' was actually an older woman. The court heard today that . the 26-year-old suffers from gender identity disorder, causing her to . feel that she was born in the wrong body. Fraud: She was sentenced at the High Court in Edinburgh, but the judge expressed sympathy with her . 'These are very unusual offences,' Lord Bannatyne said during sentencing. 'The case is clearly an exceptional one.' On . Wilson's disorder, he said: 'I accept that this leads you to genuinely . feel you are male rather than female. This significantly lowers your . culpability.' The judge . added that although the offences were serious, 'having had regard to all . the circumstances I believe they can be dealt with by an non-custodial . sentence'. Lord Bannatyne acknowledged that there was no violence involved in the offences. He also accepted that Wilson had not dressed as a boy solely to seduce the young girls, as she always wears masculine clothing. Wilson was sentenced to a three-year probation order with an additional 240 hours' community service. The Scottish Transgender Alliance argued that people should not be prosecuted for concealing their gender. A spokesman said that criminalising gender fraud threatened the privacy of transgendered people and 'seriously undermined trans people's trust in the Scottish criminal justice system'. Nathan Gale, an STA development worker, said: 'We understand that some people may be distressed when they become aware of the trans status of a partner or former partner. 'But just in the same way that people aren't obliged to share other personal information with potential partners, for example that they are married or have criminal convictions, trans people shouldn't be forced to share private information about their gender history under fear of prosecution.'","Christine Wilson had sex with two girls who thought she was male teen .

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Shortbread is not normally a source of sibling tension. Nor is it an internationally-recognised sign of complacency but, with her son closing in on a historic first Wimbledon title, Judy Murray's mind was on biscuits. 'I remember my brother getting this tin of shortbread out at the end of the second set and starting to pass it round,' said Judy. 'My mum's famous for her shortbread but I was so angry with him because you never relax until the last ball is hit and I felt he thought Andy had got it in the bag.' No one knew better than Judy by July 7 2013 that absolutely nothing should be taken for granted when it came to Andy and grand slam finals. Making history: Andy Murray was under huge pressure en route to becoming the first British man to be crowned Wimbledon champion for 77 years . Twelve months earlier she had watched on from almost the same spot as he took the lead against Roger Federer only to lose in four sets and then sob his way through an on-court speech. She had also been in New York in September 2012 when Andy appeared on course to ease to a first grand slam title as he led Novak Djokovic by two sets to love at the US Open. But back came Djokovic to level the match and, by the time Andy finally clinched victory in the fifth set after six minutes short of five hours, all in the Murray camp were so emotionally spent that a glorious numbness was all they had left. Now here was Andy again, one set away from becoming the first British man in 77 years to win one of the holy grails of sport. Djokovic took the lead in the third set, as he had in the second, but back roared Andy and suddenly he was serving for the match. 'Normally when I watch him I can remember the sequence of the match, the big points and notable things that happened but I can't remember anything about that match apart from the final game,' said Judy. And what a final game it was - 12 minutes of torture. Hugging it out: But Andy Murray almost forgot to thank his mum after securing dramatic Wimbledon win . 'At 40-0 I remember being able to hear my heart beating. I thought it was just one good point, one big serve that doesn't come back,' she said. 'But then it was deuce and Djokovic had a break point. I remember Djokovic had a net cord at one point and I swore under my breath. 'Some of his supporters were sitting across the aisle from me, literally no more than arm's length away. 'One of them was like a Serbian Buster Bloodvessel. He was getting really noisy and pumping his fist and I was determined not to take any notice because I knew he was just trying to wind me up. 'The whole thing is an absolute blur. I'm surprised I'm still alive.' Having saved three break points, an explosion of noise greeted the moment of victory when Djokovic netted a backhand. The new champion himself let out a long yell of delight and pumped his fists, celebrating with the crowd before making the customary climb up to join his supporters. He would have missed Judy, who was sitting behind the player box, but for the cries of 15,000 people urging him not to forget his mum. Andy turned back for a brief hug - not that Judy minded either way. 'I wasn't bothered at all,' she said. 'I was more concerned that he was going to fall through the flimsy roof he was standing on.' So proud: Judy Murray poses with her superstar son at Wimbledon winners ball . Plenty of accolades have come Andy's way since that scorching day in July - BBC Sports Personality of the Year, an honorary degree and freedom of the city of Stirling among them - and perhaps a knighthood will follow at some point. But for Judy it is the effect Andy and his brother Jamie, a Wimbledon champion in mixed doubles, have had on children in Scotland that pleases her most. 'Where I feel it the most is when I go to the tennis club in Dunblane where Andy and Jamie played when they were just little boys who enjoyed the game,' said Judy, who also provides guidance to up-and-coming young players through her role as a HEAD ambassador. 'It's just a four-court club in a small town in a country where tennis is very much a minority sport, the facilities are limited and the weather's terrible. 'What they've managed to achieve, when I see all the kids out on the courts, I just think it shows that you never know where they're going to end up. 'Anything is possible if you have a talent and the opportunity to fulfil it.'","Star's mother was angry when her brother handed her a shortbread biscuit two sets into such a crucial match .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A mother-of-four left on the brink of death after a devastating stroke was woken from a coma by her husband playing their favourite wedding songs. Maria Neal, 48, suddenly collapsed on her husband Steve's 46th birthday in March and suffered a stroke on the way to hospital. She was put on a life-support machine and doctors told her family to prepare for the worst. Maria Neal (centre) suffered a stroke while celebrating her husband Steve's 46th birthday (pictured, clockwise from left, Krystie, Kieran, Krystie's boyfriend, Kurtis, husband Steve and Kameron) Medics sent scans of her brain to experts at King's College Hospital and warned she would die if she could not be transferred. The London hospital agreed to admit Maria and she was airlifted for last-ditch brain surgery and then put in an induced coma after the two-hour op. Doctors weaned off her sedatives over five days but after another two days she was still unconscious and showing little signs of life. Steve, daughter Kyrstie, 20, and their three sons Kurtis, 18, Keiran, 16 and Kameron, 14, spent hours at her bedside vainly trying to coax her out of her coma. On the seventh day devoted Steve then decided to play their two favourite songs, Unchained Melody by the Righteous Brothers and Simply Red's If You Don't Know Me By Now, which they danced to at their wedding 21 years ago. To his delight within an hour of Maria showed the first sign of response, moving her arm and gently nodding. Over the next two days she began to respond more and opened her eyes on the eighth day of her coma. After that she was able to hold a pen and communicate by writing odd words, such as 'H2O' when she wanteda glass of water. Two weeks after the operation Maria started speaking again with her family. Daughter . Kyrstie, 20, said: 'We spent hours talking to her and trying to find . anything that we thought would stimulate a response. 'Dad downloaded their wedding songs onto his phone and played them to mum with tears rolling from his face onto hers. 'This broke my heart but she started to move her right arm and a couple of days after this she started nodding.' Despite Maria's progress doctors have warned her family that she will never fully recover from the crippling stroke. Steve, a cabbie, said: 'I wanted to try and get some response. If anything was going to wake her up then it would be that. After seven days doctors told Steve to expect the worst, but after he played Maria her two favourite wedding songs she showed signs of response and woke up a day later . While he was playing the songs Mrs Neal began moving her arm and then gently nodding, regained consciousness a day later and is now able to write and speak . 'After about an hour of playing the song she showed signs of movement. I was absolutely delighted, you're on cloud nine. 'The doctors then bring you back down to earth when they say that's as good as it's going to get. 'It is life-changing for her and it is life-changing for me. To what degree? I don't know that at the moment. 'I can't really put into words how I feel. She is my life partner, we have had a very close relationship and we have always been together.' Maria spent two weeks recovering at King's before being returned to Darent Valley Hospital near her home in Kent for a further two weeks. She is now an in-patient on a specialist stroke rehab unit at Gravesham Community Hospital and is allowed to return home occasionally for an hour or so. However, doctors say Maria will now have to live with a disability for the rest of her life. She . will have limited movement but it is hoped she will be able to walk . around her home in Gravesend and retain some of her independence. Her . family are now desperately trying to raise £30,000 to convert their . home by turning the ground floor into a living space for her with wet . room, suitable kitchen and wheelchair access to the garden. Steve said: 'She gets to see the kids, stroke the dog and see her personal things. It really helps her. 'Her . progress is very, very good. A few weeks ago she couldn't tell the time . or remember what I had said to her five minutes earlier. While Maria is now out of her coma, the stoke has left her disabled and the family are in the process of fining £30,000 to covert the bottom floor of their house for her to use . 'Now she can do that and physically she is getting there, although her left side is very weak. 'No one has actually said what the prognosis is long term but three medical professionals have each said she is a miracle.' He added: ''When she was first taken ill I took the kids in to say goodbye. It was one of the worst moments of my life. 'Doctors literally told us to plan for the worst and hope for the best"".' Kyrstie said : 'The long term goal is that mum will return back where she belongs so that our house once again becomes a home. 'Any donation will be received with true heartfelt thanks and appreciation. Every day my dad would say to my mum ""if you win your battle, then we will win the war"". 'My mum has done her part in winning the battle so please help us win the war and get her back home where she belongs.' A Darent Valley Hospital spokesman said: 'We are delighted to hear that Mrs Neal has recovered from her coma and is now doing so well. 'When she initially came to Darent Valley we were very concerned for her welfare and immediately transferred her to Kings. We wish her the very best for the future."" A King's College Hospital spokesman added: 'For Maria to awake from her coma after Steven played her their wedding songs is a wonderful outcome.

"By . Travelmail Reporter . Bungling . pub bosses have irritated locals and history buffs by replacing a pub . sign for the Duke of York with a picture of the wrong duke.

The pub first opened in around 1770 in memory of Prince Edward, the Duke of York and Albany, after he died in 1767. Local . Sam Tredgold, 41, a history graduate, said: ‘The Duke of York is a . great pub, but why do they keep screwing around with the name? ‘This . has got to be the most embarrassing of the lot, getting the wrong Duke . of York and sticking up a daft pub sign showing the Grand Old Duke of . York leading his men up a hill. Outrage: Locals aren't happy with the sign which includes an image of the wrong Duke of York . ‘Why bother having a pub with so much history if you go and get the very basic historical facts about the pub wrong? ‘You might as well build a new pub and called it the Prince William, Duke of Cambridge.’ Robert . Lindley, an ex-regular, said: ‘I think it's pretty lazy of Fuller's to . have just overturned the pub's history - it's another bit of tradition . lost in the town. ‘The Duke of York - the correct one - was a colourful character, a ladies' man, and I understand a bit of a lad.’ Former . landlord Dan Lambert said: ‘The history behind the original name goes . back to the 18th century during the reign of George III who opened a . tavern on the Pantiles in remembrance of his brother Edward, the Duke of . York who had died in Monaco. 'Bit of fun': Fuller's, which bought the pub, said there was no real reason behind the sign change . ‘It . was said that the brothers would frequent establishments on The .

Shayne Wood, joint owner of the Pier Road venue, created the new range of chip shop-inspired ice cream. Using fresh ingredients from Russell's takeaway next door, Shayne created Whitby's newest local delicacy. To complete the look, Shayne rolls the fish ice cream in batter and topped the whole lot off with a chip in the place of a flake. ‘The guys at the chippy thought I was mad,’ Shayne said. ‘But it was really easy.

The task was made all the more difficult as last week one of the Jersey cows which supplies milk to the ice cream parlour was killed after being struck by lightning in a storm. It isn't the first time the parlour - which has been open for four years - has experimented with unusual flavours, having previously produced corned beef, coconut korma and roasted garlic flavoured ice cream. ‘Garlic was horrible, really bad,’ said Shayne. ‘But it turns out you can make pretty much anything into ice cream.

Norwegian heavy metal rocker Kristian Vikernes, 40, arrives at a Paris courthouse to answer charges of allegedly inciting racial hatred and other charges linked to his alleged anti-Semitic and xenophobic messages . Kristian Vikernes, a well-known black metal musician in Norway, was arrested with his French wife Marie Chachet at their home in Salon-la-Tour, in Corrèze, last year. The 41-year-old, who is a convicted murderer from Norway, had in the past received a copy of a manifesto from Breivik, the far-right militant who killed 77 people in 2011. France's Interior Minister Manuel Valls said in a statement at the time: 'Having received the manifesto before (Breivik) committed his crimes and having been sentenced in Norway in the past for murder, this individual, who was close to a neo-Nazi movement, was likely to prepare a large terrorist act.'

"By . Kate Lyons . A heartbreaking picture has emerged of a little boy wandering in the desert, separated from his family while fleeing war-torn Syria. Marwan, four, was found by UN workers near the border of Jordan and Syria, lagging behind his relatives. The boy was photographed carrying a plastic bag full of his possessions on Monday by Andrew Harper, Jordan’s representative to the UN’s High Commissioner for Refugees. Scroll down for video . Desert walk: In the picture that was tweeted, Marwan, four, was helped by aid workers close to the border of Jordan and Syria . Marwan was helped to cross the border into Jordan by UN aid workers after he became temporarily separated from his family. The little boy was reunited with his mother once he reached the refugee camp . Marwan is one of more than one million children who have been forced to flee Syria as a result of the country's devastating civil war . Aid workers helped the boy cross the border into Jordan and a follow-up tweet from Mr Harper today let the world know that Marwan's family had been found. ‘Just to let you know that Marwan was safely reunited [with] his mother soon after being carried across the Jordan border,’ he shared on Twitter, along with a second picture of the boy being carried by an aid worker. It is unclear how long the boy was separated from his family. A reporter tweeted on Monday evening that a UNHCR official said Marwan was only 20 steps behind his family after he became lost during the confusion of the crossing. Nonetheless, the picture of the isolated boy has struck a chord, perhaps because it serves as a reminder of the many young children who have lost or become separated from their families due to the conflict. The picture of Marwan was one in a series of pictures posted by Mr Harper in the last few months, as the aid worker documents the ‘endless tide’ of refugees fleeing Syria into Jordan. This week, Mr Harper has also published photos of Malala Yousafzai, the young education activist shot by Taliban gunmen while on a school bus in 2012, who has been at the Jordanian refugee camp, meeting with refugees and helping them to cross the border. Last year, Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees called the conflict in Syria ‘a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history’. The Syrian civil war started with popular protests across the country in 2011 during the Arab Spring, which turned into an armed conflict after the Syrian army fired on demonstrators across the country. Different areas of the country are under government or opposition control and skirmishes take place across the country. More than 130,000 people have been killed since the conflict began and  2.5 million people, including an estimated one million children, have been forced to flee the country. An additional 5 million people are internally displaced in Syria. Most of these refugees have fled to camps in the neighbouring countries of Jordan, Lebanon, Iraq, and Turkey. Jordan, to the south of Syria, has taken in more refugees than any other country, with 613,104 refugees residing there at time of writing, according to UNHCR reports. More than 160,000 refugees currently live in the Zataari refugee camp, just south of the Jordanian border with Syria. It is now Jordan's fifth largest city. 16-year-old education activist Malala Yousafzai was in Jordan to witness life in the refugee caps and offer a hand to those coming across the border from Syria . Malala reached out to greet one young refugee, one of the many children forced from their homeland of Syria by the conflict . Syrian refugees walk across the desert to get to Zaatari refugee camp, the largest refugee camp in Jordan. Approximately 2.5 million people have been forced to flee Syria since the civil conflict began three years ago . An aerial shot of the Zataari camp shows the sprawling refugee city. Antonio Guterres, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees called the conflict in Syria 'a disgraceful humanitarian calamity with suffering and displacement unparalleled in recent history' The Zaatari refugee camp is home to more than 160,000 people who have fled from Syria in the north. The refugee camp, which is now the fifth largest city in Jordan, has seen an increased rate of arrivals in the last few months . The refugees have set up 3,000 shops and restaurants in the  camp, as well as a taxi service, schools, soccer fields and hospitals. In a demonstration of the refugees' resilience, the camp even has wedding dress boutiques, which rent out wedding dresses, and provides facials and hairdressing services to Syrian brides. Refugee arrivals into the Zataari camp peaked between January and April 2013, with 4,000 refugees arriving in one day. The rate of arrivals, which slowed in the second half of the year, picked up again in December 2013, with approximately 5,000 refugees entering the camp in the last week of the year, according to a report published jointly by the WFP, UNICEF and UNHCR. Earlier this month a ceasefire was ordered, meaning that civilians in the Syrian city of Homs, which is currently held by opposition troops, could be evacuated. Several thousand people were evacuated during the period of truce, which was mediated by the UN. Humanitarian aid was also permitted to enter the city. The United Nations halted the evacuation early after reports that dozens of men aged 15 to 55 who attempted to leave Homs during the evacuation had been detained by Syrian authorities. The UN said it would halt the ceasefire until they knew the fate of the men, reported CBS news.","Marwan, four, was found by UN workers near the border of Syria and Jordan after he was separated from his family .

He also saw evidence of her rendezvous plans. In a bid to catch her red-handed, Da Jun phoned his wife and told her he had to leave again for work. Not suspecting the ruse, Lili dropped their son off at her parent’s house and travelled to the hotel. When Wang opened the door, Lili was shocked to find that the man was in fact her father-in-law. In shock, she said, ‘this was a misunderstanding,’ and turned to leave the hotel when Da Jun revealed himself and confronted the pair. Da Jun said: ‘I’m out there working my ass off to earn money, half-dead with fatigue, and all the while you two are messing around.’ As he beat his father, hotel staff called the police who detained all three. Officers from the Bamiantong Town Muling City police station questioned Wang and Lili while Da Jun was detained for five days for assaulting his father.","Wang, 57, met Lili online, not knowing the woman was his son's wife .

"By . Lydia Warren . A senator's daughter has passed away suddenly from a blood clot a month after she suffered injuries in a hit-and-run on Capitol Hill. Lisa Radogno, the daughter of Illinois Senate Republican leader Christine Radogno and herself a senate staffer in Washington, D.C., died from the blood clot in her lung in hospital on Wednesday. The 31-year-old had returned to work as an executive assistant in the office of Illinois Senator Mark Kirk following a hit-and-run on May 8, in which she suffered injuries to her wrist and knee. An autopsy will determine if the blood clot stemmed from the crash, but an aide for her mother said they believed the two incidents were connected. Loss: Lisa Radogno, 31, passed away on Wednesday after she suffered a massive pulmonary embolism . 'My understanding is the embolism . was the result, a complication, following the hit-and-run accident,' Radogno spokeswoman . Patty Schuh told NBC Chicago. Police are still looking for the driver, who was behind the wheel of a white, four-door 2011 Nissan Maxima with Maryland tags when Radogno was hit as she crossed the street at East Capitol Street. The driver didn't stop and Radogno sought treatment for her injuries, before returning to her mother's home in Illinois to recuperate and 'get her life back'. After the break, Radogno, who was single, returned to work and to her home in D.C. She had worked in the role for seven years. Heartbroken: Her mother, Illinois Republican Senate Leader Christine Radogno (pictured earlier this month), said on Wednesday that the loss of her middle daughter was 'beyond painful' Radogno shared this photo of her daughter, with her visible hit and run injuries, holding one of her newborn twin nieces . Loved: Lisa, a staffer to an Illinois senator in Washington D.C., was knocked over in a hit-and-run last month and suffered injuries.

The person called 911 and paramedics broke down the door of her condo to reach her. Her parents flew to Washington D.C. on Wednesday morning and headed to the hospital, where they were joined by Senator Kirk. But on Wednesday, her mother shared the terrible news on Facebook. 'To . all my friends: Late today, my beautiful middle daughter, Lisa Marie . Radogno, was called home,' she wrote. 'Her death was sudden due to a massive . pulmonary embolism. 'We knew the news was not good all day but the . finality is beyond painful. Her Washington, D.C. friends have been fantastic. So great to see how much she was loved.' Scene: Lisa Radogno was crossing this road near Capitol Hill last month when she was struck by a white Nissan . Tragic: She was on the phone when she fell ill last week and the person she was talking to contacted 911. Paramedics had to break down her door at her apartment, pictured, to get inside . Following her death, her colleagues also paid tribute to her as a great member of the team. 'She was the one who sat right outside of Senator Kirk's office, so she was the one who said, ""Hey, it’s time to go, hey, we got to get moving"",' Lance Trover, one of Radogno's co-workers, told NBC.

"By . Associated Press . A California truck driver pulled into the Blue Beacon Truck Wash in central Pennsylvania and spotted an advertisement for low-cost health exams for truckers. Needing one for his commercial driver's license, he called the number on the sign and was picked up by a woman in an old Ford Tempo. She drove him to her town house, where she performed the $65 physical, had him provide a urine sample and faxed the required forms to the California Department of Transportation. It all seemed a bit odd to trucker Todd Wakefield, whose suspicions were heightened when California authorities told him about irregularities in the paperwork. Trickster: Pennsylvania state police are charging Joann Wingate who allegedly gave illegal physical exams to commercial truck drivers. Police said she advertised her services to truckers, who require regular medical exams to maintain their commercial driver's licenses . After some clever sleuthing of his own, . Wakefield turned his findings over to Pennsylvania State Police — who . say they uncovered a scam that snagged at least 16 commercial drivers . they know about, and probably more they don't. Police were looking for more possible . victims Tuesday after charging Joann Wingate, a 56-year-old chiropractor . from Carlisle whose license was suspended, with swiping the identity of . a psychiatrist with the same last name to perform bogus exams on . commercial truck drivers who needed them to maintain their licenses. Wingate was charged Friday, posted $10,000 bail and was released Monday from Cumberland County Prison. She faces a preliminary hearing July 16 on charges of forgery, identity theft, impersonation, fraud and related offenses. The phone number that state police said she used to advertise was still in service Tuesday. It answered with a recorded message that promoted services ranging from physical exams for truckers to drug testing for bath salts, oxycodone and other substances. Revealed: A driver finally gave the game away after he called Wingate about the forms. He said the ones he received were from 2012 and not valid and some of the information was wrong. He then went to the police . The recording offered a ""free five-minute shuttle from all Carlisle truck stops,"" and gave another number to call for 24-hour service. A woman who answered the phone at that number identified herself as Wingate but declined to comment. State records show that Wingate's chiropractic license was suspended indefinitely in the fall after regulators found she had been offering trucker physicals at least since 2009. It wasn't clear Tuesday whether regulators made a criminal referral to police as a result of their investigation, and a spokesman for the Pennsylvania Department of State declined to comment. Wingate continued to advertise after her suspension and, since Jan. 1, performed physicals on 16 drivers licensed in Pennsylvania, police said. She examined Wakefield, the California trucker, on June 1. After talking to authorities in that state and researching Wingate on the Internet, Wakefield concluded she wasn't who she seemed to be, police said. The trucker contacted the ersatz physician the day after his exam, and she agreed to refund his money. While meeting with her, Wakefield managed to snap a picture of her medical examiner's certificate. He later shared it with state police, who noted it bore the license number of a psychiatrist from the Philadelphia area. The psychiatrist told police she didn't perform physicals and had never been to Carlisle, a town about 20 miles from the state capital of Harrisburg. State police searched Wingate's home last week and said they found 'a large quantity of medical documents and forms related to DOT physicals,' as well as signs and brochures. They also found a small quantity of marijuana and a marijuana pipe, court documents said. State police said that truckers who believe they were victimized should contact them.","Police were looking for more possible victims Tuesday after charging Joann Wingate, 56, with forgery .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . NFL football player Michael Sam celebrated the wedding of his boyfriend's sister on the weekend - and treated his love to a brand new suit for the occasion. Sam, the NFL's first openly gay player who signed a rookie contract with the St. Louis Rams earlier this month, posted happy snaps of the Kansas City, Missouri, nuptials on his Instagram account this afternoon. In one picture, a smartly dressed Sam poses with his boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, at the lavish-looking event which friends dubbed a 'big fat Italian wedding.' 'Had a great time at @vitcamm sister's wedding this past weekend,' reads the caption, which is complete with a rainbow of hearts, presumably acknowledging that the event took place during Gay Pride. Big smiles: In a picture posted on Instagram, a smartly dressed Sam, right, poses with his boyfriend, Vito Cammisano, left at the lavish-looking event which friends dubbed a 'big fat Italian wedding' Another image shows the defensive end, 24, with the bride, 'Congratulations to the new Mrs. Meiners #meetthemeiners' A week ago, Vito Cammisano posted a picture on his own Instagram of a handsome blue suit, with the caption 'Ahhh.YES! So this arrived at my at my house today. Thank you so much babe!! Can't wait to wear this!!! @mikeysam52' In the comments, the football player responded, 'You are so welcome.' The happy event must have topped off a pretty exciting month for the 24-year-old player. It was just June 14 that Sam inked his historic multimillion dollar deal with the St. Louis Rams, a month after the team made him the 249th overall pick in the 2014 NFL Player Draft. Sam said on Twitter at the time that he . was 'grateful [and] humbled' by the opportunity to sign with the team's . other 10 draft picks and play in the NFL. Happy day: One image shows the defensive end Michael Sam, right, with the bride, 'Congratulations to the new Mrs. Meiners #meetthemeiners,' says the caption . The Rams will pay Sam $2.65 million during the four-year contract, with $46,000 guaranteed, Fox Sports reported. The players were put through team-mandated financial planning education prior to being signed, according to the network. All picks agreed to deals within the slots mandated by the league for draft picks, virtually eliminating contract negotiations that led to current Rams quarterback Sam Bradford receiving a six-year, $78million contract with a nearly $18million signing bonus and $50million guaranteed after the team drafted him in 2010. Sam said on Twitter at the time that he . was 'grateful [and] humbled' by the opportunity to sign with the team's . other 10 draft picks and play in the NFL. 'With the new rookie cap and everything it's really not difficult to get the deals done,' coach Jeff Fisher explained. GIft: A week ago, Vito Cammisano posted a picture on his own Instagram of a handsome blue suit, with the caption 'Ahhh.YES! So this arrived at my at my house today. Thank you so much babe!! Can't wait to wear this!!! @mikeysam52' 'So we just felt like this time would be better served, putting them in the situations from an educational standpoint, financial planning and those kinds of things. We've done a lot of that.' The organization announced all the players signed in a tweet with a picture of their 11-man rookie class. Sam followed that up by also tweeting out the same picture and writing: 'Grateful, humbled, and motivated after officially signing with all my Rams rookie brothers. Let's do this!!' The 2013 SEC Co-Defensive Player of the Year is believed by many to have fallen all the way to the final round of the draft because he came out during a series of interviews earlier this year.

'Thank you to the St. Louis Rams and the whole city of St. Louis. I'm using every ounce of this to achieve greatness!!' he wrote in a tweet that day. Despite having a dominant senior season at the University of Missouri, many scouts panned Sam's NFL potential prior to the draft. They said the six-foot-two-inch, 261-pound player was too small to play his natural defensive end was too small to play on the line, and that he was too slow to play linebacker. If comments made during his first press conference were any indication, the criticism did little to dent Sam's confidence. 'I'm determined to be great,' he said.","The St. Louis Rams defensive end posted snaps of the happy occasion on his Instagram account on Monday .

North Korea admitted snatching the Japanese citizens from the street before smuggling them to special espionage camps in the dictatorship. Pyongyang wanted to train the victims as spies and return them to Japan as agents.

Five of the victims have already been returned to their families in Japan. North Korea claimed that eight of the victims had died although Japan suspects there were additional victims who have not yet been acknowledged. North Korea has appointed a 'special investigations committee' to probe the abductions. Family members of the missing people met over the weekend to discuss their reaction to the course. Victims' spokesman Shigeo Lizuka told The Japan Times: 'This time, I think, North Korea will not cheat us.' The talks come as North Korea inspected test launches of missiles and rockets.

"By . Ashley Collman . Robert Downey Jr's son Indio was arrested yesterday after cops found him with cocaine, echoing his father's very public struggle with drug addiction in the 90s. The 20-year-old was riding in a car in West Hollywood Sunday afternoon when an L.A. County Sheriff's deputy conducted a search of the vehicle and found the illicit drugs. Law enforcement officials told TMZ that Indio was riding in the car around 2pm, near the intersection of Santa Monica Boulevard and La Cienega, when a police officer drove up alongside the vehicle and noticed a passenger smoking something out of a pipe. Scroll down for video . Bad inheritance: Robert Downey Jr's son Indio (left) was arrested Sunday afternoon after L.A. cops found him in possession of cocaine. Father and son pictured above in August 2011 . The Sheriff's deputy pulled the car over and conducted a search, finding Indio in possession of cocaine. The Iron Man star's son was booked in L.A. County jail and released early Monday morning on $10,250 bail. Downey has since issued a statement, thanking the police for their intervention, while expressing the belief that his son can be a 'recovery success story instead of a cautionary tale.' 'Unfortunately there’s a genetic component to addiction and Indio has likely inherited it. Also, there is a lot of family support and understanding, and we’re all determined to rally behind him and help him become the man he’s capable of being,' the 49-year-old actor said. This isn't the first time Indio has gotten in trouble for drug abuse. In October 2013, the National Enquirer reported that Indio had been admitted to a rehab facility for prescription pill abuse. At the time, Indio's mother Deborah Falconer, told the magazine that her son's problem was not that bad. 'He was not addicted,' she said. 'He was taking one pill a day.' Sources close to the family told TMZ that Indio has been in and out of treatment facilities for years, and that his father  has been deeply involved in getting him help. 'Because of Robert's own struggle he's very much in tune with his son's sobriety. And that has really helped Indio,' one source said told the outlet. The sources said Downey partly feels guilty for his son's suffering, since he too knows what it's like to be an addict. Downey and Falconer had their son in September 1993, and Indio grew up as his father struggled to stay away from marijuana, cocaine, heroin and prescription pills. Falconer and Downey split in 2001, after she became frustrated with his multiple trips to rehab and jail. Drug addict father: Indio is the son of Downey and ex-wife Deborah Falconer (left). He was born in September 1993, just before his father's drug use spiraled out of control. Downey and Falconer split in 2001. Pictured above in June 2007 . Rehab: Indio is pictured above performing at a book store in Venice, California in 2011. Two years later, his parents admitted him to a rehab program for abusing prescription pills . Family business: A 12-year-old Indio appeared with his father in the 2005 film Kiss Kiss Bang Bang . Downey abused drugs for most of the 90s, and was even jailed in 1999 for missing a court-ordered drug test. During one court hearing in 1999, Downey told a judge that he had been a drug addict since age 8, when his fellow addict father started supplying him with marijuana. In a 1988 interview, Downey said he grew up in a house where there was 'always a lot of pot and coke around'. 'When my dad and I would do drugs together, it was like him trying to express his love for me in the only way he knew how,' Downey said. Downey finally got clean in 2003, when he dramatically threw all of his drugs into the ocean following a life-changing trip to Burger King. He told Empire magazine that he was driving in a car full of 'tons of f***** dope' when he stopped at the fast-food chain to get a bite to eat. 'I have to thank Burger King,' he said. 'It was such a disgusting burger I ordered. I had that, and this big soda, and I thought something really bad was going to happen.' So he drove to the beach and unloaded his stash, vowing to end the dangerous habit. Rock bottom: Robert Downey Jr is pictured leaving court in 2001, after pleading no contest to charges of being under the influence and in possession of cocaine. Two years later, Downey got sober for good after a life-changing trip to Burger King . It was also around that time that he met future-wife Susan Levin, who was producing his film Gothika. Downey proposed to her in November 2003, but Levin only agreed to go through with the marriage if the actor became sober for good. Downey then started therapy, entered a 12-step program, took up meditation and started the martial art Wing Chun Kung Fu and described kicking drugs as like coming out of a '20-year coma'. 'The old saying is true – behind every good man there's an incredible woman. I owe a huge amount – if not all – of my success to Susan. We make a great team, and all that luck I spoke about, that's Susan,' he said. Since getting clean, Downey has experienced a career comeback, starring in such films as Iron Man, Sherlock Holmes and Tropic Thunder.

"By . Alexandra Williams . A British cyclist has been killed on one of the best known roads in the Alps after a collision with a motorist, who was also British. Joe Pether, 53, was cycling down the steep descent from the French mountain resort of Alpe d’Huez on a stretch of road famed for its 21 hairpin bends and is often part of the Tour de France route. Mr Pether, from Lower Sunbury, Surrey, collided head-on with the car at one of the road's sharp turns on Sunday evening. Sharp turns: Joe Pether, 53, from Surrey was killed while cycling down from Alpe d'Huez on a stretch of road  famous for its hairpin bends (pictured). He collided head-on with a motorist, who was also a British tourist . Police carried out a breath test on the motorist but it was negative. A local police spokeswoman from said: 'An investigation has been opened. We heard from witnesses on Monday morning but the inquiry is ongoing. 'Tragically the victim died at the scene. 'He was a British tourist, as was the driver of the vehicle. They were both tourists.' Police are investigating Sunday’s crash and examining a theory that the driver, 50, approached the turn too widely. The road attracts both cyclists and motorcyclists in large numbers, seeking to conquer the steep 13km stretch. Well-known: The stretch of road is often included as part of the Tour de France route. Last year a British bus driver was killed and three passengers injured after their bus crashed on the same part of the road . Last year a British driver of a coach carrying resort staff back to the UK was killed on the same stretch of road and three people were critically injured. The bus, with 53 people on board, was on the descent when it careered off a hairpin bend and erupted in flames.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . This is the moment a group of teens in school uniform celebrated the end of their time at school - with a drink down the local pub. The youths were spotted this afternoon in their blazers and ties at the Cheshire Midland Pub in Hale, Cheshire. In high spirits, the crowd of boys trooped down to the establishment on Friday afternoon, and sat outside the pub with schoolbags at their feet. Down the pub: The youths were spotted at the Cheshire Midland Pub in Hale, Cheshire . Day out: The pupils are thought to have just left their leavers' day celebrations at Altrincham Grammar School . The teenagers are thought to be pupils from the nearby Altrincham Grammar School, whose pupils sport green blazers. Altrincham's year 13 students - who will be facing A-level exams from this month - had their leavers' event today at school. The selective academy school is one of the best-performing in Britain, and came in the top 30 for A-level results this year, ahead of public schools such as Eton College, Westminster and St Paul's. Leavers' day hijinks have raised eyebrows elsewhere across the country this week. At another boys' grammar school - Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire - the headteacher was forced to apologise after he tweeted a photograph of students who had 'blacked up' for fancy dress. The headteacher at Aylesbury Grammar School tweeted this picture of four year 11 pupils wearing dark face paint during a fancy dress event held at the top boys' school . Year 11 pupils - three white and one mixed-race - had come to school dressed as the Jamaican bobsleigh team in a tribute to the film Cool Runnings. After an outcry, head Stephen Lehec removed the picture and said: 'It was not the intention of either the students or the school to cause offence and the school unreservedly apologises for any offence that was caused. 'The school accepts that it exercised poor judgement in not acting swiftly when it saw the boys concerned and it has taken steps to ensure that this does not happen at future school events.' MailOnline contacted the Cheshire Midland Pub, where a member of staff said that everybody's ID had been checked before they were served and that they had caused 'no trouble'. Altrincham Grammar School was not available for comment.","Pupils are thought to be from Altrincham Grammar School for Boys .

"By . Associated Press . North Korea said on Monday it is preparing to try two Americans who entered the country as tourists for carrying out what it says were hostile acts against the country. Though a small number of U.S. citizens visit North Korea each year as tourists, the State Department strongly advises against it. Investigations into Americans Matthew Todd Miller and Jeffrey Edward Fowle concluded that suspicions about their hostile acts have been confirmed by evidence and their testimonies, Pyongyang's official Korean Central News Agency said in a short report. KCNA said North Korea is making preparations to bring them before a court. It did not specify what the two did that was considered hostile or illegal, or what kind of punishment they might face. It also did not say when the trial would begin. Jeffrey Edward Fowle wil face trial for charges including 'perpetrating hostile acts' and he allegedly left a bible in a hotel room . Fowle arrived in the county on April 29. North Korea's state media said in June that authorities were investigating him for committing acts inconsistent with the purpose of a tourist visit. Diplomatic sources said Fowle was detained for leaving the Bible in his hotel room. But a spokesman for Fowle's family said the 56-year-old from Ohio was not on a mission for his church. His wife and three children said they miss him very much and 'are anxious for his return home,' according to a statement after his detention that was provided by a spokesman for the family. KCNA said Miller, 24, entered the country April 10 with a tourist visa, but tore it up at the airport and shouted that he wanted to seek asylum. One Austrian named Justin Short, 75, was detained in North Korea for distributing religious pamphlets in Pyongyang but was later deported after issuing an apology. Historically, North Korea has been harsher on U.S. Citizens and some experts believe they are using prisoners as a bargaining chip with the United States. A large number of Western tourists visited Pyongyang in April to run in the annual Pyongyang Marathon or attend related events. Miller came at that time, but tour organizers say he was not planning to join the marathon. North Korea has also been separately holding Korean-American missionary Kenneth Bae since November 2012. He was convicted by a North Korean court and is serving 15 years of hard labor, also for what the North says were hostile acts against the state. Kenneth Bae, a Korean-American Christian missionary has been detained in North Korea for more than a year . Kenneth Bae ia a Korean-American Christian missionary who has been detained in North Korea for more than a year for his religious expression . The latest arrests present a conundrum for Washington, which has no diplomatic ties with the North and no embassy in Pyongyang. Instead, the Swedish Embassy takes responsibility for U.S. consular affairs in the North. State Department officials say they cannot release details about the cases because they need a privacy waiver to do so. Pyongyang has been strongly pushing tourism lately in an effort to bring in foreign cash. The tourism push has been directed at Chinese, who by far are the most common visitors to the North, but the still small number of Western tourists to North Korea has been growing. Despite its efforts to bring in more tourists, the North remains highly sensitive to any actions it considers political and is particularly wary of anything it deems to be Christian proselytizing. After Miller's detention, Washington updated its travel warning to the North to note that over the past 18 months, 'North Korea detained several U.S. citizens who were part of organized tours. Do not assume that joining a group tour or use of a tour guide will prevent your arrest or detention by North Korean authorities.' It added that efforts by private tour operators to prevent or resolve past detentions of U.S. citizens in the DPRK have not succeeded in gaining their release. The Korean Peninsula is still in a technical state of war because the 1950-53 Korean War ended with an armistice, not a peace treaty. About 28,500 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea.","Americans Matthew .

"By . Dan Bloom . The thought of flying a high-speed plane in close formation 500ft above the sea would fill most people with dread. But it wasn't enough for a trio of British pilots - who've thrown wing-mounted explosives into the bargain. Dubbed the Flying Comets, Oxfordshire trio Twister Aerobatics are believed to be Europe's first 'pyrotechnic air display team', dazzling crowds all over the world with the stream of sparks which burst out of their wings. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Sparks will fly! The thought of flying a high-speed plane in close formation 500ft above the sea would fill most people with dread, but it wasn't enough for a trio of British pilots - who've thrown wing-mounted explosives into the bargain. Oxfordshire trio Twister Aerobatics have dazzled crowds across the world, with strict safety rules . Adrenalin: The team perform their routines of loop-the-loops and nose-dives at the Barcelona Air Festival. In built up areas they fly at 1,000ft for safety reasons . Breathtaking: The trio of British pilots who make up the Twister aerobatics team perform their pyrotechnic aerial display over Sanicol, Belgium, last year . Flashes of light: Team leader Peter Wells said it can take some time for a pilot's eyes to adjust when flying in close formation, rotating as they go to the awe of the crowd . Skilled: The Twister aerobatics team perform at the Royal Bahrain International Air Show - and this picture shows just how close the planes fly to each other . Awe: A display by the team last year over Salagalia, Italy. The team has performed in Dubai, Bahrain, Poland and Italy among other foreign countries . Pilots Peter Wells, Jon Gowdy and Guy Westgate came together after searching for 'something new' having flown for years in other teams or individually. After obtaining a display rating Mr Wells flew as a solo glider before meeting Guy Westgate at an air show. Years . later they were joined by Jon Gowdy, a British Airways pilot, and began . putting together their jaw-dropping routines of loop-the-loops and . nose-dives while sparks pour from their aircraft’s wing tips. Team leader Mr Wells, 48, said: 'It’s just so different and it is amazing to watch - when I first saw it I was stunned. I suppose we look a bit like flying comets.' Back on the ground: The planes pictured at their Oxfordshire base. The men fly in Silent Twisters developed and built by Mr Wells after he spotted a prototype in Germany . Experienced: Lead pilot Peter Wells has flown all over the desert in . the Middle East and over Mont Blanc in the Alps in his tiny plane. Inside the cockpit, right, is pictured . The team has performed in Dubai, . Bahrain, Poland and Italy among other foreign countries, at corporate . functions and even weddings. 'One . bride once phoned us after the show in tears saying it was the most . incredible thing,' said Mr Wells. 'She was so grateful she invited us to . her reception.' The men fly in Silent Twisters developed and built by Mr Wells after he spotted a prototype in Germany. Sometimes they rotate in formation, which requires extra practice. Skies at sunset: A stunning airborne picture taken from the wing of one of the planes during a display at the Bournemouth Air Festival . Upside down: The ride would be enough to make anyone feel queasy, but luckily the pilots have years of experience. They say they look like flying comets . Say cheese! One of the trio pulls a face over Andorra, Italy - though whether it's due to G-forces for for his own amusement will be known only to him . At its lowest, the team can fly 500ft above the sea to be in accordance with licensing laws - but crowds will be thankful to know that figure is usually much higher . 'It takes an awful lot of work,' he said. 'Even though we’ll all know one display, each pilot might do something slightly differently so it takes a lot of effort because we need to know exactly what we’re doing when we’re up there. 'Though it’s heavily regulated, there isn’t really much room for error. Once those pyros are on, they’re on.' In accordance with licensing laws the aircraft have to be at least 500ft above ground to perform with the wing-tip pyrotechnics. However, the team doubles this figure when flying above land to be extra-cautious, and they don't fly above crowds due to safety regulations. During a display, the second pilot must rely almost entirely on the leader to know where he is going, said Mr Wells, who keeps the planes on his farm near Thame, Oxfordshire. 'I’m always the leader when I fly so when Guy or Jon is flying behind me they’ve got to follow exactly what I’m doing,' he said. 'If their engine broke or for whatever reason they have to break from the routine it would take their eyes a good 10 seconds to adjust and regain full function. 'Though it’s heavily regulated, there isn’t really much room for error,' said Mr Wells, who has flown stunts for several years. 'Once those pyros are on, they’re on' Dizzy heights: The Twister aerobatics team perform a loop-the-loop during their unique pyrotechnic aerial display over London . Home safe and sound: Mr Wells admits there's no room for error once the pilots are in the sky and the pyros are on - but the display is heavily regulated . 'They’re in the wake of the brightest lights you can imagine.' Pyrotechnic air displays are certainly not unheard of - they were being done in the U.S. in the 1940s - but they're certainly a special sight for the thousands of people entertained by them. Mr Wells added: 'We are lucky, we’ve been able to see some absolutely incredible things because of the team. 'We’ve flown ourselves over the desert in the Middle East and over Mont Blanc in the Alps, it’s an amazing way to see the world.'","Twister Aerobatics, based in Thame, Oxfordshire, are believed to be Europe's first pyrotechnic air display team .

"By . Richard Spillett . Dee St Phorose was bundled into a police van and charged with a public order offence after shouting at a pedestrian who jumped in front of her car . A mother was bundled into a police van by four officers after she shouted at a pedestrian who walked out in front of her car. Dee St Phorose, 50, who had never been in trouble with police before, was handcuffed in front of her disabled son before being charged with a public order offence. But magistrates have now thrown out the case against her because of a lack of evidence she offended anyone. Speaking after the case, Ms St Phorose slammed the 'heavy-handed' actions of the police and is now taking her case to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC). The mother-of-two, from Islington, north London, said: 'It has been six months of . having to deal with the humiliation and the fear of prosecution. 'This was a complete waste of taxpayers' money and police resources to have four officers attending to a middle-aged woman.' The incident happened on Boxing Day last year when Ms St Phorose was travelling through Shepherd's Bush, west London with her fiance Russell Shrimplin and their son Oliver, eight. Mr Shrimplin, 51, a TV cameraman, was driving their Audi A6 when the couple say a man ignored a red light at a pedestrian crossing and stepped in front of them with a buggy. Mr Shrimplin was forced to make an emergency stop and Oliver was thrown forward and hurt his neck. Ms St Phorose shouted 't**t' at the man through her open window and her comments were overheard by two policemen standing nearby. She then was surprised when the officers told Mr Shrimplin to pull into a nearby petrol station 'for a chat'. Ms St Phorose, a full-time carer for Oliver, said: 'I was very offended when [the officer] leaned into the car and told me it wasn't Christmassy behaviour.' Ms St Phorose was travelling with her eight-year-old son Oliver when the incident happened . She added: 'I'm a Christian and he was telling me it wasn't Christian behaviour. 'We had a dispute about the word 't**t' and whether it . was a swear word. If they had just issued me with a fine, that would've . been the end of the matter but they didn't. 'Four police officers came in total and I was handcuffed in front of my son, he was extremely distressed, especially when [I was] dragged further away. 'The handcuffs were too tight and I got bruising - the pain was excruciating and I was screaming. The whole thing was disgusting. I feel extremely violated.' Ms St Phorose was taken to Hammersmith Police Station in a van where she says she was left outside for 20 minutes. After finally seeing the custody sergeant, Ms St Phorose was given a £90 fine but refused to pay it and instead was charged with a Section 5 public order offence of causing alarm or distress. Justices at the City of London Magistrates Court have thrown out the case against the mother-of-two . Six months . later, the case has now been thrown out by City of London Magistrates, . who ruled that she had not caused alarm or distress. Pc . Richard Harvey told the court he arrested Ms St Phorose because she . refused to give him her details, but she and her fiance dispute that. Pc Harvey said: 'She was very angry and kept saying she called the man a t**t because he was pushing a child into the road and repeatedly said the word t**t very loudly and there were pedestrians around. 'I asked Ms St Phorose for her name and address because I thought it could be dealt with sensibly but she refused. 'In the end, I arrested her and explained why - saying it was for a section 5 public order act because she was causing distress and alarm to passersby. I put her in handcuffs because of our failure to communicate.' Ms St Phorose represented herself because the offence was so minor she didn't qualify for legal aid. The incident happened in Shepherd's Bush, west London on Boxing Day last year . When she challenged the officer in court, he said he may have told her the situation was 'not Christmassy'. He . said: 'There might have been similar words - it was the day after . Christmas and I might have said words of that kind because it was the . festive period.' Chair of the bench Jan Carr said: 'Ms St Phorose was clearly upset by what she had witnessed and aggravated by the police. The situation escalated resulting in arrest. 'However, I have to find beyond reasonable doubt that we are certain that Ms St Phorose's behaviour caused alarm and distress. We are not satisfied this is the case.' Speaking after the case, Ms St Phorose said: 'I finally had my day in court and common sense prevails and I can now pursue my complaint for the way I had been violated.' She has now lodged a complaint with the IPCC and is awaiting a further response.","Dee St Phorose shouted at man who walked out in front of car with buggy .

"By . Mark Duell . This is the moment a husband found guilty of murdering his wife’s lover was caught on CCTV buying bin bags to wrap his victim’s blood soaked head. Heteny Tarsoly, 38, armed himself with a 2ft 6in metal crowbar and waited for victim David Hunter, 54, to return home from a night shift before beating him more than 10 times round the head. CCTV captured him on the night of the murder in Derby on January 9 buying black bin bags at a Tesco Express store in which he wrapped his victim’s head. Caught on camera: Henteny Tarsoly pictured on CCTV earlier this year in January buying bin liners at a Tesco Express store in Stenson, near Derby. He used them to wrap the blood-soaked head of his victim . It was eight days after he discovered that his wife Timea and Mr Hunter had been having an affair. Mrs Tarsoly arrived at 6.30am the next morning to celebrate her birthday with Mr Hunter, having told her husband she was going to work. Instead she found his bloody lifeless body on the grass underneath his Kawasaki 600cc motorbike at his home and tried to give him first aid. Tarsoly admitted manslaughter but was found guilty of murder with a majority verdict at Derby Crown Court yesterday. Bus driver David Hunter’s injuries were so bad that police initially thought he had been shot. They found killer Tarsoly baking a cake at home for his wife’s birthday. He repeatedly denied having anything to do with the murder before blood was found in his car and he broke down saying he had momentarily lost control. Tarsoly said he knew about the affair and had gone to Mr Hunter’s home to talk to him about his fear of losing his children. He admitted taking a crowbar with him, for protection, because he believed Mr Hunter to be ‘volatile and sometimes violent’. Attack: Heteny Tarsoly (left), 38, armed himself with a 2ft 6in metal crowbar and waited for victim David Hunter (right), 54, to return home from a night shift before beating him more than 10 times round the head in Derby . He claimed he had lost control after Mr Hunter told him: ‘She’s now my baby and they are now my children.’ Mr Hunter met Mrs Tarsoly when she found a job as a bus driver for Arriva after her husband was injured working in a chicken factory. 'It was a savage attack - such were the extent of the injuries to Mr Hunter’s head, we initially questioned whether he had been shot' Detective Chief Inspector Phil Cox, Derbyshire Police . Due to nerve damage he was left unable to work but despite the £25,000 compensation payment he received, within a year the couple were suffering money problems and it was necessary for Mrs Tarsoly to start earning. After they became friends, Mr Hunter became a regular visitor to the house and had dinner with the couple. Mr Tarsoly even admitted he liked Mr Hunter. He said: ‘Many times he was invited to our house for dinner or supper and after sometime he moved into the house for a month or so. And yes, I was happy (about this).’ But Mr Hunter and Mrs Tarsoly’s friendship developed into a love affair and in September last year she asked her husband for a divorce. The day after his murder, she let herself into his house, only to be surprised to find he was not there, realising he had not even been to bed. Investigation: Police at the scene of Mr Hunter's murder. The bus driver's injuries were so bad that police initially thought he had been shot . Police discovered Mr Tarsoly had worn an extra layer of clothing, which he had also wrapped in the bin bags bought from the Tesco Express in Stenson, near Derby, and then burnt on the family barbecue the following day, before dumping the ash in a litter bin. Traces of Mr Hunter’s blood were also found on shoes discovered at Tarsoly’s address. He had cleaned the crowbar and put it back in its usual place in his garage. 'His untimely death means that the family have been deprived of a loving father, grandfather, brother, uncle and nephew' Spokesman for David Hunter's family . A spokesman for Mr Hunter’s family said: ‘His untimely death means that the family have been deprived of a loving father, grandfather, brother, uncle and nephew. ‘Two families have been devastated because of the actions of this man.’ Detective Chief Inspector Phil Cox, of Derbyshire Police, said: ‘It was a savage attack - such were the extent of the injuries to Mr Hunter’s head, we initially questioned whether he had been shot. ‘The police and prosecution believed this was murder, in the fact that Heteny Tarsoly planned to kill David Hunter that night. I’m just pleased now the family feel they have got justice for David but this is just the beginning of the mourning process for them. ‘Tarsoly’s actions have destroyed not just David’s family but his own and they will have to live with the consequences for a long time.’","Heteny Tarsoly beat David Hunter around head with 2ft 6in metal crowbar .

"By . Mark Duell . A 'slip-shod' tradesman who fitted a stone mantelpiece that collapsed and crushed a six-year-old girl to death wept in a court dock today as he was jailed for eight months. Isabella Pritchard - known as Bella - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by Christopher Elmer, 39, of Greenford, west London, crashed on top of her. The girl, who attended £10,000-a-year Maltman’s Green School in Gerrards Cross, Buckinghamshire, was taken to hospital where she died from her catastrophic injuries. Crushed to death: Isabella Pritchard (left) - known as Bella - suffered massive head injuries after the heavy stone fireplace installed by Christopher Elmer (right), 39, of Greenford, west London, crashed on top of her . Bella was believed to have been swinging from the mantelpiece when it came away from the wall. Elmer was jailed after a judge branded his work ‘slip-shod’ and said he was ‘guilty of carelessness.’ He had taken shortcuts and only sparingly used adhesive to attach the 13st 8lb (86kg) limestones to the wall, Reading Crown Court in Berkshire heard. Iain Wicks, prosecuting, said: ‘She [Bella] suffered catastrophic and non-survivable head injuries when a limestone fireplace surround collapsed on top of her, probably as a result of her having swung on it in play. ‘The fatal incident occurred on July 7, 2012, just over eight months after the fire surround had been fitted by this defendant who at the time was a self-employed fireplace fitter. ‘The subsequent investigation into his work on this installation showed a number of shortcomings, amongst which was a reliance purely on adhesive only sparingly applied as the sole means to secure the two uppermost and heaviest stones to the wall. ‘It was these stones, with a combined weight of some 86kg, which fell on Bella Pritchard and which killed her almost instantly.’ Elmer had been employed by fireplace manufacturers Chesneys Ltd as a warehouse operative and driver between 2005 and 2007, the court heard. In 2007 he handed in his notice and became a self-employed fireplace fitter after shadowing others for just three months. The court heard that there were no instructional courses available in fireplace fitting. Hearing: Reading Crown Court (pictured) in Berkshire was told he had taken shortcuts and only sparingly used adhesive to attach the limestones to the wall . Mr Wicks explained that Beejay Enterprises started building a new home for the Pritchard family in January 2011 in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire. Bella’s father visited Beacon Fireplaces in Beaconsfield, and chose the Clandon Bolection limestone fireplace for the ground floor formal living room - and Beejay’s contracted Elmer to fit it. The judge heard that the Clandon Bolection had a substantial mantle shelf and was made from extremely heavy limestone. Mr . Wicks said that there were no specific instructions tailored to the . particular mantelpiece and the workman would have been expected to use . his own fittings, knowledge and experience. 'Slip-shod' tradesman: Elmer hanged his head and cried as details of the case were outlined . He added: ‘It is self-evident that the fitting of such heavy items requires some expertise and considerable care on the part of the fitter. This is not a task for the unsupervised DIY enthusiast to have a go at.’ Mr Wicks explained that despite there being no industry guidelines or standards as to how a stone fireplace should be fitted, a competent installer should be able to approach each job with ‘sufficient skill and judgement to adopt to the requirements.’ ‘In the case of the Clarendon Bolection it should have been self-evident to a competent and careful fitter that the mantelpiece required more that high strength adhesive to ensure a fail-safe bound,’ he said. The court heard that this would have been achievable by drilling into the back of the mantle so that mechanical fittings could be applied to the fire surround and wall. Elmer had only used Ardurit, a high strength adhesive, to the mantle and even that was applied sparingly, the court was told. Laboratory tests carried out at Imperial College London following the tragedy found that if mechanical fixings had been applied to the same mantelpiece it would have required a downforce of 2,290kg to move it, but not cause the collapse. The prosecution contacted a number of experts as they built up the case against Elmer and they unanimously said that they would not have solely relied on adhesive to secure the mantle in place. Elmer, who appeared in court wearing a smart grey suit, grey tie and white shirt, hanged his head and cried as details of the case were outlined. Elmer admitted a Health and Safety Regulation breach on what should have been the first day of his trial earlier this year. Giuseppina Silvo, defending, said: ‘This is a 39-year-old man who thought he had learned a trade, a trade which was going to be the career for the rest of his life. ‘He will never fit another fireplace again... He understands this has destroyed the Pritchard family’s life and not a day goes by he doesn’t himself think about what happened. ‘The sense of guilt he feels is immense. This is a tragedy of unimaginable proportion.’ The court heard that as a result of the accident Elmer had recently been working as an LGV driver. Judge John Reddihough told him: ‘This is a dreadful tragedy. ‘Your failure to properly and safely to fix a very heavy stone fireplace in the Pritchard family home led to it coming away from the wall and falling on Bella Pritchard, a six year old little girl, killing her. 'The effect of the dreadful events upon her parents and three brothers will last the rest of their lives. There will be a void in their lives' Judge John Reddihough . ‘The effect of the dreadful events upon her parents and three brothers will last the rest of their lives. There will be a void in their lives. ‘As has been said the loss of a life, particularly that of a child, cannot possibly be measured in terms of a sentence that the court imposes upon the person deemed responsible.’ Judge Reddihough branded Elmer’s work ‘slip-shod’ and said he gave no thought to the risks. On jailing Elmer for eight months and ordering him to pay £1,000 towards costs, he added: ‘It must be made clear to persons that go into homes professing to be a skilled workman and carry out slip-shod and unsafe work that result in death, that they must be punished.’ Bella’s father attended the hearing but did not comment after Elmer had been jailed. At the time of her death, her headmistress said: ‘She was a very special little girl with an infectious love of life. She will be remembered for her wonderful smile, her laughter and her caring gentle nature.’","Isabella Pritchard suffered massive head injuries and later died in hospital .

"By . Jonathan McEvoy . Roger Federer did not so much wield a racket as wave a wand on the sunlit grass of Wimbledon on Tuesday. It was another masterclass in a tournament of masterclasses from the seven-time champion, in this instance against Tommy Robredo, the usually stubborn Spaniard who was dismissed from the premises in 94 minutes of imperious precision. Comfortable: Roger Federer is through to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon after demolishing Tommy Robredo . Unstoppable: Federer took just 21 minutes to take the first set, and didn't lose a point on serve in the second . It was almost as if time had stood . still and a young Federer in his first bloom was with us again. At 32, . he is no more likely to shrivel away and disappear from the All England . Club than its famous ivy. His . accumulation of statistics is phenomenal; he is the only competitor in . the men’s singles not to have lost a service game in four rounds. None . of his matches has lasted longer. ‘It’s like being a footballer,’ he . said. His serve was . dominant, his net play clean and incisive. Poor Robredo made the fatal . mistake of starting poorly, winning just 13 points in the first set and . committing a horrific series of unforced errors. By the time he was up . and running in the third set, it was way too late. That . was the story of one Swiss victory on Tuesday. The other was unfolding . on Court Two: a fractious contest won 7-6, 7-6, 6-3 by Federer’s . countryman and close friend Stan Wawrinka against Feliciano Lopez. Experienced: But it wasn't Tommy Robredo's day on Court No 1 . The . two men were locked in heated dispute as the match ended, tension having . built as the match developed, but they shook hands in the end and . claimed that everything was mended when they came to speak to the press . afterwards. The upshot is a . Swiss-Swiss quarter-final: Wawrinka versus Federer. Never before has . that country had two men reach the last eight here. More . intriguingly, set against Federer’s long period of success, Wawrinka . outranks Federer – third versus fourth – in the world standings. He is . also the player more recently to have won a Grand Slam tournament, this . year’s Australian Open. Yes they are buddies, but has Wawrinka’s recent success not changed the dynamic between them? ‘Which . dynamic?’ said Federer, leaning on 17 Grand Slam titles. ‘Well, I think . for him the dynamic has changed a lot. Definitely in terms of showing . up for the big moments, believing he can come through them after . previously losing a lot of close matches against many of the top guys. Sunny day: Fans packed into to watch the match at SW19 on Tuesday . ‘People clearly marked him out after the Australian Open, but it started at the US Open and just prior to that. ‘So . I am really happy for him that he’s been able to keep it going strong, . even though he had had some ups and downs that are inevitable after a . big win like the Australian Open.’ These . are heady sporting days for neutral Switzerland. A few hours after the . wins of Wawrinka and Federer, they scuttled back to their TVs – separate . screens, different locations – to watch the World Cup match between . Argentina and Switzerland. A loss, though it lasted a good deal longer than Federer’s match. Well, you can’t have everything. Just . before the match, the big-serving Wawrinka was wearing a t-shirt with . the slogan ‘Stan the Man’. When questioned, he said he wasn’t . necessarily the man – that sounded a bit boastful, he thought. It this . was just a nickname. I suppose a ‘Stan Not the Man’ t-shirt would be . ludicrous. Classy: Federer could be set for a semi-final clash with Rafael Nadal . But can he be the . man against Federer on Wednesday, just as he was in the final of the . Masters 1000 in Monte Carlo? On the negative side, due to the weather . delays on Saturday, will be playing his third match in as many days. ‘That win in Monaco will give me a lot of confidence,’ he said, ‘knowing that I can beat him on the big stage. ‘But . tomorrow it’s going to be a different experience. First time on grass. First time at Wimbledon. Five-set match. Yeah, it’s going to be tough.’ Did that not sound a touch defeatist? He . added: ‘You know when you play Roger at Wimbledon, when he’s fit and . confident and feeling well, it’s one of the biggest challenges in . tennis. It’s like playing Rafa in the French Open. These guys are . playing their best tennis for many years.’ Tommy Robredo will most certainly attest to that in the case of Mr Federer.","Federer took first set in just 21 minutes, and didn't lose a point on serve in the second .

'It's hard to get over the death of anybody and I'm still seeing specialists because they are still trying to work out the correct medication. So it's work in progress.' Dee also renewed her claims that the system was to blame for how much she is paid by the state and insisted she has not scammed any benefits and has only claimed what she is entitled to. She added: 'I seem to be the person that is to blame for the whole of the benefits system. But it's the government that needs to look at it. If people want to blame me than, by all means, give me the Prime Minister's job.' Photos of Dee downing shots and cocktails at a 'Carnage Magaluf' night earlier this year sparked fury in the UK .

The 35-year-old was even treated to a massage by one of his companions as he soaked up the sun with pals at the Spanish resort's Ocean Club. Surrounded! Ricky Hatton looked to be enjoying himself as he soaked up the sun at the Ocean Club in Marbella . Sangria time: The boxer appeared to be enjoying a tipple during his break in the Spanish resort . There was no sign of his other half as he reclined on a lounger, while sipping on a drink and flashing his numerous tattoos. The father-of-three opted for a simple, long pair of black trunks, complete with red logos, which he teamed with a chunky gold watch and bracelets. He kept his dark aviators firmly on as he sat next to the swimming pool, however didn't appear to feel the need to take a dip despite the sunny weather. Ricky . appeared to be oblivious to the topless female sat next to him as he . chatted to a brunette, who was sporting a pink two-piece.

"By . Matt Chorley . and Tom Mctague . The Conservatives have surged ahead of Labour in a new opinion poll, as voters backed David Cameron in his battle with Brussels. The Tories are backed by 33 per cent of voters, according to the latest Ashcroft survey, two points more than Ed Miliband's party on 31 per cent. It comes after a separate poll showed Mr Cameron is the most intelligent political leader in Britain - and UKIP leader Nigel Farage is the  weirdest and most stupid. Scroll down to see video . The Conservatives have jumped to five points ahead of Labour in the latest Lord Ashcroft poll. 1,006 adults were  interviewed by telephone between 27–29 June 2014 . David Cameron was all smiles in the Commons this afternoon after Tory MPs read out the results of the Ashcroft poll showing the Tories ahead of Labour . The survey will send shockwaves through the Labour party, which has become embroiled in a fresh bout of infighting over its ability to win the next election. The Ashcroft poll, carried out from Friday to Sunday, suggests Mr Cameron has been boosted by his hardline stance against arch-federalist Jean-Claude Juncker becoming President of the European Commission. The Prime Minister was defeated by all but one of the EU's 28 leaders on Friday. In the Commons today, Mr Miliband suffered 'utter humiliation'. He told MPs: 'You returned to Britain on Friday having failed. 'Not some mild small failure, but an appalling failure of relationship building, winning support and delivering for Britain.' But Mr Cameron defended his strategy of continuing to make his case, despite being in a minority. 'Facing the prospect of being outvoted, some might have swallowed their misgivings and gone with the flow but I believe it was important to push the principle and our deep misgivings about this issue right to the end. 'I at least wanted to put Britain's opposition to this decision firmly on the record.' The approach appears to have resonated with voters, putting the Tories two points ahead in the Ashcroft poll, with the Lib Dems on 9 per cent and UKIP down two points on 15 per cent. Despite the Conservatives being ahead in the voting intention, 32 per cent want a Labour government against 25 per cent favouring a Tory government in 2015 . Lord Ashcroft, a former Tory donor and now pollster, said: 'The boost in the Tory share may well be largely thanks to Mr Juncker: the poll was taken between Friday afternoon and Sunday evening, when political news was dominated by David Cameron’s stance against the appointment of the new European Commission president. 'We will see in the coming weeks whether this support can be sustained.' Mr Cameron was last ahead in a poll in May, when two polls showed the first Tory lead for two years. However, more voters would prefer to see a Labour government after the 2015 election. Almost a third (32 per cent) would most like to see a Labour government, compared to 25 per cent backing a Conservative administration. A further 9 per cent back a Tory-Lib Dem coalition, while just 8 per cent support a Labour-Lib Dem power-sharing deal. However, just 80 per cent of Labour supporters wanted to see Mr Miliband governing alone and only 77 per cent of Tory voters favoured a Conservative-only government. Surprisingly, 3 per cent of Labour voters want to see a Tory government, while one per cent of Tories prefer a Labour government. The Ashcroft survey emerged after a poll of the 40 most marginal seats in the country revealed what voters think of our political leaders. Mr Cameron is seen by four out of 10 voters as smarter than Mr Miliband,  Clegg and Mr Farage. He is also considered by far the least 'weird'. Pollsters ComRes interviewed 1,008 adults living in the 40 most marginal constituencies where the Conservatives and Labour shared first and second place at the last General Election in 2010 . The interviews were carried out online between June 18 and 25. Of the 40 constituencies, 25 currently have a Conservative MP and 15 a Labour MP . However, the ComRes survey suggested Mr Cameron is still on course to lose the next election, putting Labour ahead by five points in the constituencies which will decide May's crunch poll. Labour are backed by 36 per cent of the public in the 40 most marginal Labour-Tory constituencies - ahead of the Tories on 31 per cent. The Lib Dems sit on just seven per cent, 10 points behind UKIP on 17 per cent. Some two thirds of the public in the marginal seats say they will decide who to vote for based on which party has the best policies on the issues important to them. Just one in seven say the party with the leader who will make the best Prime Minister will get their vote. ComRes chairman Andrew Hawkins said the Tories needed to convince voters they were on their side to stand a chance at the next election. He said: 'Despite talk of the polls narrowing in favour of the Conservatives, this poll shows that in the seats which really matter Labour remain stubbornly in front. 'To have any prospect of staying in power David Cameron has to persuade voters that he and his Party understand the needs and concerns of ordinary people. He certainly cannot afford weeks like the one he has just had.' Mr Cameron is also seen as the 'most competent' political leader - and the one most likely 'to get things done'. The Prime Minister even outscores Mr Miliband when voters are asked which leader has the 'right policies for Britain'. But Mr Cameron remains hampered by his privileged background. Half of voters in the 40 crunch constituency battles rate the Prime Minister as 'the most out of touch with ordinary people'. And despite voters considering Mr Farage the 'weirdest' political leader, he is also seen as the least out of touch. Around a third of voters meanwhile see the  Mr Miliband and Lib Dem leader Nick Clegg as out of touch.","Ashcroft poll reveals Tory bounce after stand-off over Jean-Claude Juncker .

"By . Laurie Whitwell . Follow @@lauriewhitwell . Australian Open champion Stan Wawrinka has heavily criticised Wimbledon officials for their curious planning which leaves him with a ‘terrible’ schedule of three matches in three days. The world No 3 beat Denis Istomin 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in their third round match today that was delayed from Saturday when rain wiped nearly five hours from play. The pair were due to be third on No 1 Court but were told their match would be postponed for the weekend despite Wawrinka pointing out they could have been fitted onto an outside court, replacing a junior or doubles match, once the weather got better. In a hurry: Stan Wawrinka beat Denis Istomin in straight sets to reach the fourth round . Outclassed: Denis Istomin was beaten in straight sets by Stan Wawrinka . He said . the referees’ office claimed it would be a security risk to place his . match on a smaller court and suggested officials look after their own . interests rather than the players’. Wawrinka, 29, now faces a tiring . programme of a fourth round match against either Feliciano Lopez or . John Isner on Tuesday, before a potential quarter-final clash on . Wednesday. ‘For . sure I was disappointed,’ Wawrinka said. ‘If you look for this week, me . or Lopez or Isner have to play three matches in three days. Five-set . matches. It’s terrible for the body. ‘I . was expecting them to move matches, move maybe juniors or doubles, to . make my match or the Isner-Lopez match first on when they started again . at 5.00pm or 6.00pm when it stopped raining. ‘They . played doubles five-set match on Saturday on many courts.

Deep in thought: The upcoming race at Silverstone will be Button's first since his father John passed away . Close: Button will have his fiancee Jessica Michibata by his side ahead of an emotional race at Silverstone . One reason is McLaren have again handed Button a car that is off the pace of their main rivals. McLaren boss Ron Dennis, however, has stirred the pot by insisting Button should be 'trying harder' following the impressive arrival of rookie team-mate Kevin Magnussen who will have served as 'a wake-up call'. For Button, though, the primary reason behind his potentially tough weekend is it will be his first at Silverstone without father John, who passed away in January this year. To that end, Sunday has been designated as 'Pink for Papa' day, with pink t-shirts on sale in aid of the Henry Surtees Foundation. The charity was set up by John Surtees, a world champion on two and four wheels, in memory of son Henry that assists and supports people with injuries caused by accidents. The pink t-shirt is a reminder of the 'lucky' pink shirts worn every grand prix Sunday by John Button, who only missed one of his son's grands prix in 14 seasons prior to his death. In the driving seat: Button during qualifying for the Austrian Grand Prix last month . Fans: Button signs autographs at the Goodwood Festival of Speed at Goodwood House on June 28 . 'This year will be extra special for me, and probably a little more emotional than normal - it's normally very emotional anyway because of the support, but it will be more so this year,' said Button. 'We're trying to get as many people wearing pink as we can, which is going very well, and I will be wearing a pink helmet, so there will be a lot of pink at Silverstone in support of my old boy. 'I'm really excited about it, but it is going to be very emotional.' Need for speed: Button driving his McLaren MP4/26 during the Goodwood Festival of Speed on June 28 . Unfortunately for Button, approaching his 15th British Grand Prix, the chances of him ending his wretched podium hoodoo are slim. Button is haunted by the fact that not once in 14 previous attempts in his home race as he managed to finish in the top three and soak up the acclaim of an often fervent support. 'We won't get on the podium at Silverstone. No chance!' said a forlorn Button. 'As it's my home race I'll get an extra lift, but it won't make us go any quicker - I wish it would.' Home advantage: Fans of Button and Lewis Hamilton at the post-race concert in 2012 . Despite that the event will still be one to savour for Button, thanks to the home support, with over 300,000 expected at the circuit over the course of the three days. 'For every driver the British GP is a good grand prix,' added Button. 'It's one of the old-school tracks, and one of the races where the grandstands are packed, with the British fans very good as they support everyone. Motivation: McLaren boss Ron Dennis has had some strong words for Button ahead of the British Grand Prix . 'I think they support their home-grown a little bit more, but they still support everyone, which is really good to see. 'So I think every driver likes and enjoys the British Grand Prix, in terms of a sporting event. 'But for a British driver, yeah, it's very special, as it is for any driver racing in their home country. 'A lot of people that work in Formula One are British, and there are a lot of British fans who understand the sport and don't just see cars whizzing around. 'So it's great going home to race and seeing the support from the British public who, for me, really understand the sport a lot.'","It will be first time British driver has raced at Silverstone since his father passed away .

"By . Phil Duncan . Follow @@PhilDuncanF1 . McLaren chief Ron Dennis has urged Jenson Button to 'try harder' ahead of this week's British Grand Prix. The Woking outfit are in the midst of another disappointing campaign following on from last year's disastrous season where they failed to register a single podium finish. McLaren appeared to have turned a corner over the winter after rookie driver Kevin Magnussen and Button finished second and third respectively at the season opener in Australia in March. Signed, sealed, delivered: McLaren driver Jenson Button greets fans at the Goodwood Festival on Saturday . But the British team have failed to visit the rostrum since, with Button recording a best result of only fourth at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier this month, while Magnussen's seventh place last time out in Austria is his best finish since Melbourne. Button has scored 14 points more than his rookie team-mate, but the pair are evenly matched over one lap this term, with the McLaren duo tied at 4-4 ahead of Button's home race this weekend at Silverstone. 'I'm sure Kevin is giving a big wake-up call for Jenson, and in some ways you say: ""Great, we've made a great choice with Kevin"", but in other ways you say, ""Come on, Jenson, you are a world champion and one thing you can do on a consistent basis - and you should be doing it - is beating your team-mate"". In action: Button wows the crowds at the Goodwood Festival of Speed on Saturday . Speaking his mind: McLaren boss Ron Dennis . 'Do I want him to try harder? Of course I do - he's a highly-paid grand prix driver. 'Yes, we are not giving him the best car and, yes, it would be challenging for him to win in it, to say the least, but he could do his bit and Kevin has to make it as difficult for him as possible.' Button is out of contract at the end of this season and McLaren have already made contact with Ferrari's unsettled Fernando Alonso about a return to the British team. Dennis has also targeted a sensational reunion with another of his former drivers, in Lewis Hamilton, and the McLaren chief refused to deny that the British star, whose deal at Mercedes runs until the end of 2015, is on his radar. 'We would always hope that the best available drivers would wish to drive our cars,' added Dennis. 'The . key word is ""available"" because people have contracts and we respect . those contracts, but if Lewis was in a position to drive for us next . year, as with many of the other top drivers if they were in that . position, we'd love to have them on board. 'No . one should ever feel threatened, either drivers or engineers, all we . want to do is win and we have to take considered positions and . considered decisions on that process.'","Jenson Button is eighth in the drivers' standings with 43 points .

"By . John Greechan . He doesn’t really have to dance a jig. A choreographer’s fee is almost certainly not included in his contract for the Glasgow Grand Prix. And the idea of using the Commonwealth Games to reprise his double act with Usain Bolt is, as Mo Farah himself suggests, a little dated. To be honest, the sporting public will just be happy to see Mo – our Mo – doing what he does best at Hampden. National hero: Farah has won Olympic, European and World titles running for Team GB . That means possibly going for one of the longest standing British records in this month’s glittering Diamond League event. And then delivering double gold at Glasgow 2014. No need for whistles, bells … or crazy celebrations. Yet Farah, asked if he and the world’s fastest man might go for a repeat of their London 2012 smash hit, when Usain did the Mobot and Mo struck the sprinter’s famous Lightning Bolt pose, laughed as he declared: ‘Nah, it’s been done already. You’ve got to come up with something new. Maybe a Scottish dance!’ Oh Mo, don’t give the promoters any ideas. They’ll have you done up in a kilt and spearing a haggis before you can say ‘photo opportunity’. That fact that both Bolt and Farah are now scheduled to compete at the Commonwealth Games is, of course, a boost to an athletics public about to feast on a double helping of track and field. Embraced: Despite running for England in Glasgow, Mo will be cheered by the Scottish crowds . Farah’s appearance in a special two-mile race at the Glasgow Grand Prix, partly to help readjust to life back on the track following his short-lived excursions into marathon running, will undoubtedly be the biggest draw in a two-day festival bringing many of the world’s best to Scotland. Might Britain’s greatest distance runner, a man who admits that world records over 5k and 10k are part of his long-term ambition, be tempted to have a crack at Steve Ovett’s British record for the rarely-run two-mile race – a record that has stood since 1978? ‘I haven’t thought too much about it but, at the same time, Steve Ovett did it pretty well,’ he said. ‘We will have a think as we get closer to it. Winning is more important. ‘It would be nice to run good times and go fast but I don’t know how close it would be to get to the world record of 12:37mins for 5k or the 10k at 26:17mins. ‘Realistically, I can get closer but it all depends on what happens after the Commonwealths, with the worlds next year and then the Olympics. You have to plan, sit down with your team and see what’s what. ‘It’s hard to say exactly where I am at the minute. The 5k I ran a few weeks ago was just to test myself. But it seems to be going in the right direction. Champions: Farah celebrated with Usain Bolt after they each won Gold at London 2012 . ‘Coming off the marathon, it wasn’t easy. I came off the marathon and took a break. But it’s quite exciting, the way things are going. ‘The marathon was great fun. I wouldn’t change anything in terms of how I prepared. But it’s hard. A lot of people talk about the marathon but, unless you give it a go, you’ll never know. ‘I’m glad I gave it a go. I did everything, prepared well, but it was my first marathon. Hopefully I will improve because of the experience. ‘After the marathon, I took it all quite slowly but, when things started going the right way, I decided to do the Commonwealths. Now I’m trying to peak for the Commonwealths, that is the aim. ‘The Grand Prix will let us see what I can do, see what kind of shape I’m in. This will let me see how I’m going, then I can head into the Commonwealth Games, which will be quite exciting. ‘Any competition at this level will be hard. In the Commonwealths, it’s going to be hard because of the guys running against me. Backing: The Londoner is hoping to repeat his 2012 double in front of another supportive stadium . ‘But that’s what I need, to race against the Kenyans, the Ugandans … it’s tense but it should be exciting.’ Farah is still based in Oregon for the most of the year, embracing the notoriously low profile of track and field in the States – a far cry from the kind of commotion he’d cause trying to wander through the streets of his home town of London. Still, he misses plenty about Britain, listing football, big breakfasts and cups of tea – in that order – before admitting that he’s regularly up early to watch his beloved Arsenal on TV, while he’s currently tuning into World Cup even while running on his treadmill. As for Scotland’s national football stadium, well, he’s never even been to Hampden. Not so much as seen a picture of the new track, nor spoken to a soul who has. World Champion: Since London Farah has added European and World double Golds to his CV . Memories of running at the Kelvin Hall in January 2012 linger still, though, with the reception he got from the crowd that day inspiring hope for more of the same this summer. He is likely, then, to join a very select band of England superstars to have received a standing ovation at the grand old ground. Twice in the space of two weeks, too. ‘When it comes to athletics, we tend to come together as the UK,’ he said. ‘Even though I’m going to be competing for England, I think the Scottish people will still be behind me.’ That’s a pretty safe bet. Even if you don’t throw in a fling, a burl or a leading role in a 40,000-some reel.

A son whose father was given a life sentence for arranging his mother’s murder to avoid the cost of divorce told the court that he forgave him and urged him to ‘confess and repent’. Magdi Girgis, 62, from Westminster, California, was sentenced on Friday to life without parole for his part in a plot to have his wife, Ariet, 55, killed. She was stabbed to death and nearly decapitated by men who entered the family home and bound and gagged Magdi’s youngest son, Ryan, 17, during the September 2004 attack, the trial heard. Scroll down for video . Astonishing message: Richard, the son of Magdi Girgis, who was jailed for plotting to kill his wife, said that he forgave his father . During sentencing, the couple’s other son, Richard, said ‘I forgive you dad for all that you have done to me and Ryan. Confess, repent’, according to KCBS-TV Channel 2. However, Magdi maintains his innocence. He told the judge that he had ‘nothing to do with the killing of my wife’. His sons said that they live in constant fear of their lives, worried that their father will have them killed for speaking out against him. Richard told the court: ‘I sleep with a gun under my pillow. I have an alarm, dogs and cameras around my house.’ Plea: Magdi Girgis told a hearing that he was not responsible for his wife's murder . Fear: Magdi's youngest son, Ryan, said that he was bound and gagged during the 2004 attack . Prosecutors claim that Anthony Edward Bridget, who is due to stand trial in July, was responsible for the murder of Ariet. They allege that he, and other suspects still at large, bound and gagged Ryan and killed Ariet with a sharp object. After the attack Ryan broke free and alerted the authorities. He said his mother’s last words – ‘take anything you want’ –have left him distraught. Brutal: Ariet Girgis was nearly decapitated in the 2004 attack at her Westminster home . Magdi, a respiratory therapist, told the trial: ‘I’m not a bad father. Maybe I am strict. But I love them. I love my kids.’ Prosecutors say that Ariet was killed days before she was due to testify in a domestic violence case against Magdi, according to the LA Times. They argued that Magdi hired the killer to avoid a costly divorce and a conviction that would harm his career.","Magdi Girgis, 62, has been given life for arranging his wife's brutal murder .

"By . Australian Associated Press . Australian frigate HMAS Darwin has struck again, this time relieving drug smugglers of more than six tonnes of hash in a high seas bust off the coast of Africa. The operation follows a succession of major seizures of hashish and heroin and other drugs, now totalling more than 12 tonnes, since Darwin deployed to the Middle East in March. In the latest bust, Darwin's boarding parties located 315 bags, each containing around 20 kilograms of hashish, hidden aboard a smuggling dhow intercepted in international waters in the Indian Ocean. Over six tons of hashish seized during a recent boarding placed on the flight deck of HMAS Darwin, prior to destruction . Australian warship HMAS Darwin has continued its mission success with another drug seizure . The total haul came to 6248 kilograms, with an estimated street value of some $250 million.

Darwin is operating a part of Combined Task Force 150 whose commander, Royal Navy Commodore Jeremy Blunden said this was another outstanding result. ""My congratulations to Commander Morrison and his very fine ship's company who have set new standards for professionalism and teamwork in counter narcotics activity in the Indian Ocean,"" he said in a statement.

'Somebody put the photograph on a story to do with a soldier being killed in Iraq. 'The story was complete rubbish, but it the picture went massive - I tried to correct the mistake, but you can’t control something like that.' But the response to the picture encouraged him to develop his interest in photography. He sold prints of the labrador picture to local pubs and it has been so successful that his primary business of running holiday accommodation in the . Peak District is now being overtaken by the interest in his images of animals and nature scenes. He said: 'I would go to the pub on a Friday night for a quiet pint and then the landlord would constantly be pointing tourists in my direction, saying that I was the guy that took the labrador picture.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . Earth's magnetic field is a protective shield for our planet from cosmic radiation, but it's also somewhat of a mystery - scientists aren't sure why it moves and changes in intensity. And now the first set of high-resolution results from Esa’s three-satellite Swarm constellation reveal that the field is actually getting weaker, albeit by a small amount. Measurements . made over the past six months confirm the general trend of the field’s . weakening, with the most dramatic declines over the Western Hemisphere. Scroll down for video . Esa's Swarm constellation of satellites have measured changes in Earth's magnetic field from January to June 2014. These changes are based on the magnetic signals that stem from Earth's core. Shades of red represent areas of strengthening, while blues show areas of weakening, measured in nanoteslas . Launched in November 2013, Swarm is providing unprecedented insights into the complex workings of Earth’s magnetic field, which safeguards us from the bombarding cosmic radiation and charged particles. The magnetic North pole has been moving for at least 100 years since measurements began. It is near the Geographic North Pole but, unlike the latter, does not stay in the same place. Having recently departed the Canadian Arctic it is now moving towards Siberia. It can move as much as 37 miles (60 kilometres) a year, but in recent times it has begun to slow down, suggesting it may double back on itself. The reason for its movement, however, is unknown. In some areas, such as the southern Indian Ocean, the magnetic field has strengthened since January - although the overall trend is a weakening. The latest measurements also confirm the movement of magnetic North towards Siberia. These changes are based on the magnetic signals stemming from Earth’s core. Over the coming months, scientists will analyse the data to unravel the magnetic contributions from other sources, namely the mantle, crust, oceans, ionosphere and magnetosphere. This will provide new insight into many natural processes, from those occurring deep inside our planet, to space weather triggered by solar activity. In turn, this information will yield a better understanding of why the magnetic field is weakening. 'These initial results demonstrate the excellent performance of Swarm,' said Rune Floberghagen, Esa’s Swarm Mission Manager. 'With unprecedented resolution, the data also exhibit Swarm’s capability to map fine-scale features of the magnetic field.' The results were presented at the Third Swarm Science Meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark. The data collected by the Swarm satellites will help scientists better grasp how our magnetic field works, how it is affected by solar activity, and why large tracts of it are weakening. Esa says the field can be thought of as a huge bubble, protecting us from cosmic radiation and charged particles that bombard Earth in ‘solar winds’. Without it, those particles would hammer away at the atmosphere, leaving Earth much like Mars. Swarm is a ESA satellite mission that launched on 22nd November 2013 (illustrated right). The . mission consists of three identical satellites that are precisely measuring the strength and direction of Earth's magnetic field. The new . data is being processed by the British Geological Survey to produce an . accurate map of this field. In . order to best measure the field, the satellites orbit in a unique . configuration. Two satellites will fly side-by-side at height of 280 miles (450km), . while the third satellite will fly at an altitude of 330 miles (530km). The . lower two satellites allow very fine measurements of the magnetic . field generated by the rocks in the Earth's crust, which are difficult . to detect otherwise. The upper satellite gives a simultaneous . measurement at a different location. Swarm (illustration shown) is Esa's first Earth observation constellation of satellites. The three identical satellites were launched together on one rocket. The satellites' orbits drift, which will result in the upper satellite crossing the path of the lower two at an angle of 90° in 2016 . This 'snapshot' of the main magnetic field at Earth's surface as of June 2014 is based on Swarm data. The measurements are dominated by the contribution from Earth's core (about 95%) while the contributions from other sources (the mantle, crust, oceans, ionosphere and magnetosphere) make up the rest . The agency said the field is particularly weak over the South Atlantic Ocean - known as the South Atlantic Anomaly. Many glitches or ‘hiccups’ are caused by this anomaly, as satellites are exposed to strong radiation over this area. Some experts believe the overall weakening heralds the reversal of Earth’s magnetic field, where the north becomes south and south becomes north - a process that is thought to take several hundred thousand years to complete. Almost all of the observed changes are based on the magnetic signals that originate in Earth’s core. Over the coming months, scientists will analyse the data to better understand the magnetic contributions from other sources. Apart from understanding our world better, scientists believe measurements obtained by Swarm will have a number of real world applications, including improving the accuracy of navigation systems, advanced earthquake prediction and better efficiency in drilling for natural resources. The magnetic field and electric currents near Earth generate complex forces that have immeasurable impact on our everyday lives. Although we know that the magnetic field originates from several sources, exactly how it is generated and why it changes is not yet fully understood .","Esa's Swarm satellite constellation reveals data on Earth's magnetic field .
The results, presented in Denmark, show the field is weakening in places .
The Western Hemisphere, in particular, is dramatically getting weaker .

"By . Paul Bentley . Forensic teams were yesterday scouring a concealed shaft and sewers yards from the spot where Madeleine McCann vanished. After sniffer dogs found the pit on Tuesday, detectives from Scotland Yard moved in to seal off the area with large white tents. Five forensic officers were called in to start excavating the shaft and were seen removing several bags of evidence. Scroll down for video . Investigation: Forensic police officers have been pictured preparing to . examine a hole (left) in an area of wasteland 1,000ft from Portugal's Ocean . Club resort where Madeleine McCann (right) went missing in 2007 . Development: Scotland Yard officers can be seen moving a white gazebo over the hole in the ground . Detectives were also scouring sewers . in Praia da Luz, but a spokesman from Scotland Yard refused to provide . ‘a running commentary’ on whether any leads have so far been found. British police have been combing scrubland 300 yards away from the villa where three-year-old Madeleine disappeared in 2007. The . area is the size of three football pitches and is thought to contain at . least 12 key areas of interest which officers are planning to examine. It was chosen because a suspect who was carrying a young girl was seen . walking in the direction of the site on the night that Madeleine was . last seen alive. More equipment: As evening approached, detectives brought in more equipment to examine the area . Search: Scotland Yard detectives will reportedly search sewers this afternoon as the team continue to use radar equipment (pictured) to explore the coastal scrubland of Praia da Luz in Portugal's Algarve region . Examining the scene: British police officers discuss how best to progress earlier today . Aerial surveillance: A drone is employed to help examine the site from the sky . The scrubland is one of three separate locations which will form part of the extensive search operation. On . Tuesday sniffer dogs led their police handlers to a pit concealed by . bushes. The shaft had an opening measuring around 5ft by 3ft which was . covered with wooden planks, a large corrugated iron sheet and mounds of . earth. The thick . surrounding overgrowth was cleared with chainsaws and mowers before . spades were used to raise the cover, which is thought to have been in . place for years. Officers could be seen removing evidence in a wheelbarrow before carrying several closed bags away for further tests. Area: The force has identified 41 areas of work in the region seven years after Madeleine disappeared . Police continue to dig and patrol with dogs in a bid to find clues connected to Madeleine's disappearance . Search: The advanced radar detection equipment has been flown in to scour the plot of land . Map: The search site is 300 metres from the apartment at the Ocean Club resort in Praia da Luz and the tapas bar her parents were dining at and close to where a suspect was seen with a girl in his arms on the night she was abducted in May 2007 . A . local source said: ‘The discovery of the hole came as a surprise. Police are meant to be here for five to seven days but this may delay . things.’ Elsewhere on the site, sewers are being analysed by British . detectives using micro cameras and fibreoptic cables. Kate and Gerry McCann (pictured speaking to press shortly after Madeleine's disappearance) are bracing themselves for 'significant news' but are not in Portugal, reports claim . The . complex system of unused piping was installed as part of failed plans . to build a hotel on the land before Madeleine disappeared. Detectives . are also using ground-penetrating radar equipment and have so far found . the bones of pigs and cattle – which were photographed and analysed . before being ruled out as evidence. Yesterday . two cadaver dogs who were used in the search for murdered Welsh . five-year-old April Jones in 2012 were helping to search the scrubland. The seven-year-old English springer spaniels – Tito and Muzzy – can cover a far larger area than humans in much less time. In the past they have uncovered bodies more than 20 years after they disappeared. And . a British company whose experts have in the past worked to identify . bodies after the 9/11 and 7/7 terrorist attacks has sent some of their . forensic archaeologists and anthropologists to Portugal to help with the . case. The work is due to . run at least until the weekend, and last night local sources said that . Scotland Yard has applied for a seven-day extension to the dig. The search comes after David Cameron ordered a reinvestigation of the Madeleine case in 2011. As part of Operation Grange, Scotland Yard has made 287 requests for action, which identify 41 priority areas of work. Madeleine’s parents Kate, 46, and 45-year-old Gerry McCann have not travelled to Portugal but are being kept closely informed.","Forensic tents erected at spot of interest in Praia da Luz on the Algarve .

"By . Mark Prigg . A New York firm has revealed ambitious plans to send a spacecraft to Mars to bring back dust from the atmosphere in 2018. The BoldlyGo Institute - a new, privately funded, not-for-profit organization, is hoping to attract a billion dollars from donors to fund the mission - beating Nasa to the red planet in the process. It also plans to launch a space telescope to hunt for alien life. Scroll down for video . The mission could launch in 2018, and will involve a daring high-speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude. Once in the Martian atmosphere, 'ears' will appear, giving the craft solar power. One contains the gel it will use to capture particles from 40km above the surface. The mission could launch in 2018, and will involve a daring high-speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude. The mission is timed to coincide with seasonal Martian dust storms, collecting thousands of precious Martian dust particles from the atmosphere. Particles will be collected in a gel, similar to the one recently used to capture particles from a comet. After the sample collection pass at Mars, the spacecraft returns directly to Earth, where its precious, sterilized samples descend by parachute to the ground. The first of the missions BoldlyGo intends to pursue is Sample Collection for Investigation of Mars (SCIM), a Mars flyby mission that would dive deep into the martian atmosphere. The spacecraft would collect atmospheric dust during that flyby and return it to Earth after skimming just 40km form the surface of the red planet during a dust storm. The SCIM mission concept dates back more than a decade to when it was a finalist for NASA’s first Mars Scout mission, a competition won by the Phoenix Mars Lander. The mission could launch in 2018, and will involve a daring high-speed atmospheric pass down to below 40 km altitude. The mission is timed to coincide with seasonal Martian dust storms, collecting thousands of precious Martian dust particles from the atmosphere. After the sample collection pass at Mars, the spacecraft returns directly to Earth, where its precious, sterilized samples descend by parachute to the ground. Laurie Leshin, the principal investigator for the original SCIM proposal, said at a recent meeting that the organization was working with industry partner Lockheed Martin to update the mission concept. 'The Sample Collection to Investigate Mars will return the first samples of Martian materials to Earth without the complexity and risk of landing, and at a fraction of the cost,' the firm said. 'As the first round trip mission to Mars, SCIM will break new ground, and set the stage for future visits to Mars by humans. 'SCIM will fundamentally advance our knowledge of the geology, climate and habitability of Mars, a terrestrial planet that may have been similar to Earth in its early history. 'As the first sample return from another terrestrial planet, SCIM will provide a unique data set and a comparative basis for understanding how the rocky inner planets formed and why they have evolved so differently from each other.' The craft will make its way back to Earth with the sterilised samples on board . It will use a parachute to touch down - and samples from the Martian atmosphere will then be distributed to labs around the world . The second project is a novel space telescope for the post-Hubble era called Astro-1. Dr. Jon Morse, chief executive officer of BGI, said: 'The future of space science is at a critical juncture in the United States and around the globe. 'We know how important and exciting this kind of research is, but the unfortunate reality is that government funding for space science is falling, even while public interest in space remains high. 'BoldlyGo Institute will play a leading role in advancing this NewSpace Science movement, aimed at nothing less than incredible discoveries.' The organisation cited cuts in Nasa funding for its existence. 'This is a challenging yet exciting time in the planetary and space sciences, with limited government funding for space missions but also some new opportunities through private and commercial avenues,' said Dr Meenakshi Wadhwa, Director of the Center for Meteorite Studies at Arizona State University and a BGI board member. 'The current model leaves a tremendous amount of frontier science on the cutting room floor.We are compelled to explore new ways to advance our scientific goals, and I believe that the model we have created with BoldlyGo Institute will do just that.""","Craft will pass 40km above the Martian surface .

A woman has been found stabbed to death after a sobbing schoolboy turned up on a neighbour's door covered in blood. A man was also discovered with injuries and is in hospital in a critical condition after the double stabbing earlier today in Wolverhampton. The child, believed to be of secondary school age and the son of the couple, fled the bloody scene to raise the alarm. The man in his 30s and woman, 36, were discovered at the address at about 7.47am after police arrived at the gruesome scene. A forensic officer leaves an investigation tent erected at the back of the house where a woman was found dead and a man was found suffering from critical injuries . Gathering evidence: Officers were called to reports of disorder at the house in Newhampton Road West, Wolverhampton, this morning . One neighbour said: 'We heard the . little lad was covered in blood and crying uncontrollably when he . knocked on a neighbour's door, that's when police were called. Carol O'Mahoney, another resident who . lives nearby, said: 'Neighbours said they had a five-year-old boy and . that the little one was seen running from the house for help this . morning covered in blood.' Another neighbour, a woman in her 20’s who lives behind the block of flats said: 'I know the old lady who lives next door and I went round to see if she was okay earlier. 'She said the couple have a boy and he knocked on her door first but it was quiet so she didn’t hear him. 'By the time he knocked on the next door he was hysterical and crying ‘help me’ so the guy opened and saw him covered in blood so rang the police. Another neighbour who also did not wish to be named said at the scene: 'It’s shocking, she was a very pretty, slim lady. She was very quiet and he was very quiet too. 'I don’t know if their child is a boy or girl but it is only young, I would see them putting him or her in the car.' Police have said they are not looking . for anyone else in connection with the incident which happened in a . house that is used as temporary accommodation in the Whitmore Reans area . of the city. The scene of the murder in Wolverhampton . The family is believed to be of Iranian origin and West Midlands Police have launched a murder inquiry.

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . They are two titans of technology, locked in a bitter gadget war for the coveted title of the world's best smartphone. But Apple's iPhone and Google's Android software appear to be neck and neck, according to an incredible set of satellite pictures that chart their use across America's biggest cities. The maps, which use geo-located tweets and the cell phone metadata attached to them, show who is using iPhones and who is using Androids. Scientists analyzed around three billion geo-tagged tweets over a period of two years and plotted the maps, using red dots for iPhones and green dots for Android. New York: The red dots represent iPhones, the green dots represent Android and the purple dots represent Blackberries . Washington DC: The maps, which use geo-located tweets and the cell phone metadata attached to them, show who is using iPhones and who is using Androids . Chicago: The maps reveal that the iPhone are overwhelmingly used in the most densely-populated urban areas while the Android is more popular in the suburbs . Developed by Gnip, MapBox and tech-data expert Eric Fischer, the maps reveal that the iPhone are overwhelmingly used in the most densely-populated urban areas while the Android is more popular in the suburbs. Mapbox CEO Eric Gundersen said: 'The patterns of usage in each city often reflect economic . stratification. 'For example iPhones, in red, are predominantly in . wealthy sections of the city while Android phones, in green, have more . coverage in poorer sections. 'On a global level, national trends reveal a . complicated set of cultural preferences.' It comes two years after late Apple boss Steve Jobs pledged to use his 'last dying breath' to destroy Google's Android phone because he believed it was based on stolen iPhone technology. Revealed in an advanced copy of the Apple co-founder's authorised biography, he branded it 'grand theft Android' and promised to spend all his company's money to wreck them.

Houston: Mapbox CEO Eric Gundersen said iPhones, in red, are 'predominantly in wealthy sections of the city' while Android phones, in green, have 'more coverage in poorer sections' Mr Jobs, who died earlier this month, vowed 'thermonuclear war' and said that he would not accept any compensation because all he wanted was the company ruined. Apple has embarked on a war against Android, suing companies who have adopted the software for their phones or tablets. 'I will spend my last dying breath if I need to, and I will spend every penny of Apple's $40 billion in the bank, to right this wrong,' he said. 'I'm going to destroy Android, because it's a stolen product. I'm willing to go thermonuclear war on this.' Atlanta: Gundersen said the patterns of usage in each city 'often reflect economic stratification' Jakarta: But it is a different story in other countries around the world such as in Jakarta, India, where people prefer to use Blackberries . The rant in the book provides insight into the unravelling of Jobs' relationship with Eric Schmidt, the former CEO of Google and an Apple board member from 2006 to 2009. Jobs was livid in January 2010 when HTC introduced an Android phone that boasted many of the popular features of the iPhone. Apple sued, and Jobs went on an expletive-filled rant at Google's actions. In a subsequent meeting with Schmidt at a Palo Alto cafe, Jobs told Schmidt that he wasn't interested in settling the lawsuit, the book says. 'I don't want your money. If you offer me $5 billion, I won't want it. I've got plenty of money.

But . due to the T5 debacle in March 2008, when one in five flights were cancelled . and 28,000 suitcases went missing, Heathrow development director John . Holland-Kaye and his team are opening T2 in stages. United will be the only carrier to begin with and, for the first few days, T2 will only operate at 10 per cent of its total capacity. Scroll down for video . Taking off slowly: The new terminal will operate to just 10 per cent of its capacity . Taking no chances: Volunteer passengers wait at a check in desk in the departures hall during a test day . Spacious: British artist Richard Wilson's sculpture Slipstream dominates this view of the new Terminal 2 . There will be just 34 flights on the first day, with T2 having only to deal with 6,000 passengers. By October, United will be joined by more than 20 other airlines, including Air China, Singapore Airlines and Lufthansa. Virgin’s domestic operation, Little Red, will also be using the new terminal. When fully occupied, T2 will be home to 26 airlines and will have more than 330 flights a day to more than 50 destinations. Mr Holland-Kaye said, 'Opening a new terminal is one of the most complex challenges that any airport can undertake.' 'We can't guarantee that opening day will be perfect. There is a very high risk of things happening (on the first day) when . you carry out a live operation for the first time.' Gavin . Hayes, director of the Let Britain Fly campaign, said: 'The opening of .

Officially . named Terminal 2, The Queen’s Terminal, . the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will officially open T2 on June 23. heathrow . bosses said that this time around they had 'sought advice from other . airports around the world and learnt lessons from opening T5'. Under the managership of the west London . airport's development director John Holland-Kaye, the creation of T2 has . been accompanied by numerous test runs involving thousands of . volunteers. More than 180 trials for T2 have taken place over the last six months involving 14,000 volunteers. Extensive trials of the systems were carried out, with everything tested - from . individual aspects of terminal operations, such as the check-in process, . to large-scale trials that test the complete passenger journey . T2 replaces the old Terminal 2 at Heathrow which closed in 2009 after 54 years of service. New look: Inside Heathrow Airport's Terminal 2 which is due to open to passengers next week . It . boasts 60 check-in gates and 66 self-check-in kiosks, 29 security . lanes, 33 shops, 17 restaurants, more than 7,000 seats, 634 toilets and . 42 water fountains. Facilities also include a John Lewis store and a Heston Blumenthal restaurant. By . the end of the year it will be handling passengers at the rate of 15.8 . million a year and it has been built to take up to 20 million a year. shafts of natural light and high quality acoustics should make the building a calm space for travellers accustomed to high anxiety at dark, noisy airports, said lead architect Luis Vidal. 'You can never completely erase your memory of the former Terminal 2, because it was a dreadful experience. This will be completely the opposite. This will be a destination. People will want to come here,' he said. The . completion of the £2.5billion project is part of an £11billion . refurbishment designed to keep London's biggest airport competitive with . other major European hubs including Amsterdam, Frankfurt and Paris. Causing a debate: The BBC's Question Time was broadcast from new terminal last week . Striking: The Slipstream sculpture is the centrepiece of the development, hanging 18m above the ground with a design intended to evoke the path of a plane in flight . Home to 25,000 staff, T2 is part of an . overall project that includes not only the terminal building but also a . 1,712ft satellite pier, a 1,340-space car park, an energy centre and a . cooling station. It will host 26 airlines, including United, Air Canada, Singapore Airlines and others that are part of the global Star Alliance, and offer flights to 51 destinations. Check-in will be large enough to . accommodate 3,000 passengers an hour and an average of 55,000 passengers . will arrive and depart a day. There will be more than 50 shops, as well . as 17 bars and restaurants. Officials say the terminal will be the . first in the world to offer a 'complimentary personal shopping lounge . where trained stylists will present a curated range of products for each . client.' The . interior of the new terminal is dominated by a huge aluminium sculpture . hanging 18m above the ground that is inspired by the flight path of a . stunt place. British . artist Richard Wilson's 'Slipstream' weighs 77 tonnes and is 78m in . length, its vast bulk looming above the terminal's main lobby and . escalators, evoking the journeys that those who see it are set to embark . on. One of the features of the new terminal . will be the ability of passengers to check in at any desk regardless of . which airline they are travelling with. Passengers will be able to . take their meal on board from all the T2 restaurants and travellers are . also being promised that there will be a selection of dishes guaranteed . to be ready in 15 minutes. Royal approval: The official name for the new site is Terminal 2 The Queen's Terminal . Future of travel: An average of 55,000 passengers will arrive and depart at the new terminal per day . Passengers have been warned to expect teething troubles at T2 this summer and the airport's bosses said the challenge of opening a new terminal should not be underestimated. During the . T5 fiasco in 2008, thousands of bags were sent astray while passengers . faced long queues after problems delayed staff from getting to work. 'The chance of a completely smooth opening for any airport terminal in the world is low,' Heathrow's development director John Holland-Kaye said. He added that even with immense pre-planning, there was the chance of a passenger 'turning left instead of turning right' on the terminal's opening day tomorrow.","First flight will touch down early tomorrow morning .

Artist impression of the The coldest, faintest white dwarf star ever detected, that is so cool that its carbon has crystallized, forming the Earth-size diamond in space. White dwarfs are the extremely dense end-states of stars like our Sun that have collapsed to form an object approximately the size of the Earth. Composed mostly of carbon and oxygen, white dwarfs slowly cool and fade over billions of years. The object in this new study is likely the same age as the Milky Way, approximately 11 billion years old. It is 900 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Aquarius. 'It’s a really remarkable object,' said David Kaplan, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. 'These things should be out there, but because they are so dim they are very hard to find.' Kaplan and his colleagues found this stellar gem using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory’s (NRAO) Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and Very Long Baseline Array (VLBA), as well as other observatories.White dwarfs are the extremely dense end-states of stars like our Sun that have collapsed to form an object approximately the size of the Earth.

The object in this new study is likely the same age as the Milky Way, approximately 11 billion years old. Pulsars are rapidly spinning neutron stars, the superdense remains of massive stars that have exploded as supernovas. As neutron stars spin, lighthouse-like beams of radio waves, streaming from the poles of its powerful magnetic field, sweep through space. When one of these beams sweeps across the Earth, radio telescopes can capture the pulse of radio waves. The pulsar companion to this white dwarf, dubbed PSR J2222-0137, was the first object in this system to be detected. It was found using the GBT by Jason Boyles, then a graduate student at West Virginia University in Morgantown. conditions on the star are so cool that its carbon has crystallized, forming the Earth-size diamond in space. The pulsar was then observed over a two-year period with the VLBA by Adam Deller, an astronomer at the Netherlands Institute for Radio Astronomy (ASTRON). These observations pinpointed its location and distance from the Earth -- approximately 900 light-years away in the direction of the constellation Aquarius. The researchers calculated that the white dwarf would be no more than a comparatively cool 3,000 degrees Kelvin (2,700 degrees Celsius). Our Sun at its center is about 5,000 times hotter. Astronomers believe that such a cool, collapsed star would be largely crystallized carbon, not unlike a diamond. Other such stars have been identified and they are theoretically not that rare, but with a low intrinsic brightness, they can be deucedly difficult to detect. Its fortuitous location in a binary system with a neutron star enabled the team to identify this one.","Coldest, faintest white dwarf star ever detected .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . The woman who police say viciously attacked a New Jersey mother in front of her two-year-old son has turned herself into authorities. Latia Harris, 25, surrendered to police on Monday night in relation to last week's brutal that was captured on video. Authorities say they were 'close to capturing' the fugitive over the weekend in Philadelphia. Surrendered: Latia Harris, a South Jersey woman who police say attacked a mother in a field in Salem County turned herself in on Monday evening. Harris had been eluding capture for six days . Caught: According to New Jersey State Police, the attorney for Latia Harris called them on Monday saying Harris would surrender within an hour . Harris faces two counts of aggravated assault and two counts of making terroristic threats. The 4'9"" tall, 100 pound Ferreira says the attack left her with a broken nose and a mild concussion. Police say Harris is the attacker seen in the video wearing a red McDonald's uniform. The fight began because investigators believe Harris thought Ferreira, a one-time coworker, had spread rumors about a romantic relationship between Harris and a work supervisor. Horrifying aftermath: Catherine Ferreira, 27, suffered a broken nose, two . black eyes and a mild concussion, but she said she could have been dead . had her assailant struck her in the right spot . Team effort: Salem City Police Department partnered with the New Jersey State Police Fugitive Unit and the United States Marshall¿s New Jersey/New York Regional Fugitive Task-force in an effort to locate Harris . Bystanders: The attack was even more shocking given that many people simply stood around and videoed the fight with their cellphones instead of trying to prevent it from escalating . Harris thought the revelations could jeopardize her job. On the video the Harris is seen kicking Ferreira while she is laying on the ground and spitting at her. Police managed to obtained a copy of the video depicting the attack before it was removed from Facebook. The . graphic footage showed the McDonald's employee pounding Ferreira and being punched and kick her at least 20 times. Incredibly, Ferreira's two-year-old son was in the middle of it all, trying to intervene by kicking and screaming at Harris. ‘Mommy!’ the little boy cried out. You better get your son before I kick him in the [expletive] face too,’ she screams. The beating ends with the McDonald's staffer spitting on Ferreira lying bleeding on the ground. Before . she walks away, the woman warns the brutalized young mother: 'It's not . over... you almost made me lose my job… stupid tramp.' Police officers were called to the scene just after 7pm after receiving reports of a woman covered in blood. They found the 27-year-old bleeding . profusely from her face and acting disoriented and confused. She was . taken to The Memorial Hospital of Salem County to be treated for injuries to her face. What has caused uproar is that fact several people witnessed the attack but did nothing except record it on their cell phones. The video of the brutal beating went . viral, yet none of the bystanders . seen in the footage came to Ferreira’s aid as she was being brutalized . by the much larger woman. Little hero: Ferreira said her sole protector during the beating was her 2-year-old son, Xzavion, who threw himself on Latia Harris . Caught: Latia Harris, 25, is in jail and now facing charges of assault and making terroristic threats . '[It's outrageous] that it occurred . in front of a 2-year-old and because people didn't intervene. The video . is clear, you can see people not looking at the fight itself but looking . at their camera looking at the fight,' said Chief John Pelura, Salem Police. Meanwhile, Jim Burlaga, the owner and operators of the McDonald's where Harris worked, released the following statement: . 'I . am aware of the incident involving one of my employees earlier this . week. I am extremely disturbed by this kind of behavior and it goes . against the values and standards that I expect from my employees in my . restaurants. This employee will . not be serving customers pending this important police investigation and . I'm fully cooperating with the local police in this matter.' Harris has not shown up for work following the incident. Last week, just days after the assault, Ms Ferreira said she was shocked that no one besides her toddler came to her rescue. Appearing before the cameras last Friday she could be seen with a badly swollen face and two black eyes. The video shows her being thrown to the ground like a rag doll and repeatedly being punched in the face. 'I think it’s messed up no one came to my rescue,' Ferreira told NBC Philadelphia. The only person to intervene on behalf of the woman was her 2-year-old, Xzavion Ortiz. ‘I became so much closer to my son . because he didn't care what was going on,’ she said. ‘He wasn't afraid. He just wanted to defend his mom.’ Idle gossip: Ferreira (left) said her feud with Harris (right) started a couple of weeks ago when she dropped by the McDonald's where she once worked to chat with her friends and mentioned that Harris had a relationship with a manager . Different persona: Harris also goes by the name Alima Zawjatul Abdul Sabur . Family matters: The 25-year-old has two young children (pictured) and a large family in Philadelphia . Ms Ferreira explained to NJ.com that she used to work at the same Salem McDonald’s as Harris. Two . or three weeks ago, she stopped by the eatery to chat with some of her . former colleagues, and at one point Ferreira made an off-hand remark . about Latia Harris' alleged romantic relationship with her supervisor. According to Ferreira, the 25-year-old . overheard her comment and became upset. In the weeks that followed, . Harris kept calling her and saying that she could get fired over the bit . of gossip. Last Tuesday, . Ferreira said she was walking home with her son at around 7pm when . Harris ambushed her in a clearing behind the McDonald’s and smacked her. Face-off: Police in New Jersey have obtained this cell phone video showing a female McDonald's worker dressed in a burgundy uniform confronting a young mother in a wooded area in Salem . Pummeled: The attacker, identified as Latia Harris, pulled the 27-year-old woman to the ground in front of her 2-year-old son and proceeded to punch her in the face about 20 times . 'Monstrous': The victim's son tried to intervene by repeatedly kicking her attacker in the legs until Harris threatened to kick the 2-year-old in the face (right) No mercy: The assailant kicked the mother in the back as she lay on the grass in a fetal position with witnesses standing around her . The 4-foot-9, 10-pound . mother tried to reason with Harris and informed her that she did not . want to fight, but the woman ignored her pleas, hurling Ferreira' to the . ground. ‘I could have been . dead right now, had she hit me in the right spot it would have been . over, over nothing,’ Ferreira tearfully said. ‘McDonald’s isn’t worth . it, a guy isn’t worth it.’ The . people who witnessed the attack and did nothing to stop it have been . condemned by local police and the media, but Ferreira cautioned against . demonizing them, stressing in the interview that they should not be seen . as ‘monsters.’ At the time, when speaking of her attacker, Ferreira broke down . in tears, saying she felt sorry for her because the woman has two . children. Ominous warning: The 25-year-old allegedly threatened to shoot the victim as payback for nearly getting her fired from McDonald's before she spat on her and walked away .","Latia Harris, 25, turned herself in around on Monday evening .

"By . Mark Prigg . If you've ever been caught in a rainstorm, you may have thought there is nothing worse. However, researchers have revealed a major new insight into rain on the sun - and say it puts our own into perspective. Just like on Earth, the Sun has spells of bad weather, with high winds and showers of rain. Scroll down for video . A mosaic of images obtained using the Swedish Solar Telescope (SST), revealed evidence of a rain shower pouring relentlessly into the dark sunspot on the surface of the Sun. The coronal rain shower appears as the labelled giant arching water-fall-like flow. At the top left the Earth is depicted on the same scale. Rain on the Sun is made of electrically charged gas (plasma). It falls at around 200,000 kilometres an hour from the outer solar atmosphere, the corona, to the Sun's surface. The thousands of droplets that make up a 'coronal rain' shower are themselves each as big as Ireland. But unlike the all-too-frequent storms on Earth, rain on the Sun is made of electrically charged gas (plasma) and falls at around 200,000 kilometres an hour from the outer solar atmosphere, the corona, to the Sun's surface. And the thousands of droplets that make up a 'coronal rain' shower are themselves each as big as Ireland. A team of solar physicists, led by Dr Eamon Scullion of Trinity College Dublin, have pieced together an explanation for this intriguing phenomenon, with imagery that shows a 'waterfall' in the atmosphere of the Sun. Discovered almost 40 years ago, solar physicists are now able to study coronal rain in great detail thanks to state-of-the-art satellites like the NASA Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) and ground-based observatories like the Swedish 1-m Solar Telescope (SST). The scientists see regular and massive shifts in the solar 'climate', but despite decades of research have until now been unable to understand the physics of coronal rain. It turns out that the process through which hot rain forms on the Sun is surprisingly similar to how rain happens on Earth. If the conditions in the solar atmosphere are just right, then clouds of hot, dense plasma can naturally cool and condense and eventually fall back to the solar surface as droplets of coronal rain. In another parallel with terrestrial weather, the material that makes up the hot rain clouds reaches the corona through a rapid evaporation process. But here the evaporation is caused by solar flares, the most powerful explosions in the Solar system that are thought to help heat the Sun's outer atmosphere. The origins of solar coronal heating nonetheless remain one of the longest standing puzzles in solar physics. The torrential rain storms, driven by solar flares, may play a fundamental role in controlling the mass cycling of the solar atmosphere and act as a kind of 'solar-scale' thermostat in regulating the temperature fluctuations of the solar corona. Dr Scullion and his team have now developed a new insight into how coronal rain forms. Together with collaborators in Trinity College Dublin and the University of Oslo in Norway, he suggests a model of 'catastrophic cooling', where an exceptionally rapid fall in temperature causes material to change from rarefied coronal gas to 'raindrops'. The team used images from the Swedish Solar Telescope based on La Palma in the Canary Islands, a telescope that produces some of the sharpest images of the Sun available. In June 2012 they observed a giant 'waterfall' of solar material pouring down from the outer atmosphere of the Sun into a dark sunspot on its surface. Another set of images have been assembled into a movie and show how a solar flare precedes a 'rain shower'. Dr Scullion comments: 'Showers of 'rain' and waterfalls on the Sun are quite something, though I wouldn't recommend taking a stroll there anytime soon. 'But the parallels with weather on Earth are both striking and surprising.'","Each droplet that makes up a 'coronal rain' shower is as big as Ireland .

"By . Steven Wright . Progress: Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe has admitted that there has been movements in the McCann case, suggesting that officers are closing in on the person that abducted her . Britain's most senior police officer has suggested his officers are closing in on the people who abducted Madeleine McCann. Scotland Yard boss Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe admitted his officers have the names of suspects and that ‘some progress’ is being made in the inquiry. But he declined to be drawn on when the suspects would be quizzed over her disappearance in Portugal seven years ago. He told BBC’s Radio 5 Live: ‘We have sent three letters of request for international assistance to the Portuguese judiciary, because that is the way their system works. ‘We have got lines of inquiry which are different to the Portuguese Police’s and we are working with them to try to resolve that. 'We are making some progress.’ Asked by presenter Nicky Campbell whether his officers had the names of suspects, he replied: ‘That is correct’. He declined to comment further. Sir Bernard’s comments came after the Mail revealed exclusively last month that the Met has identified three burglars as prime suspects for Madeleine’s disappearance. Analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction, at the time she went missing, and that they were in close contact with each other in the hours that followed. Following our revelations, Portuguese newspapers reported that three former Ocean Club workers are Scotland Yard’s prime suspects over her disappearance. Details of the men’s alleged links to the Mark Warner-run resort in the Algarve, where Maddie vanished from in 2007, were revealed in a number of Portuguese newspapers with close links to local police. They were disclosed two days after . Portuguese police had a high-level meeting with a visiting Scotland Yard . delegation late last month. At . the meeting, Met detectives are reported to have requested bank details . of the men, who are thought to have carried out a series of break-ins . at the Ocean Club in the run up to Maddie’s disappearance. Although . local media reported the men had been employed at the Ocean Club . complex in Praia da Luz, it was not clear whether they were working . there at the time Madeleine went missing in May 2007. Nor was it clear whether they were directly employed by Mark Warner, or through a contractor. Madeleine McCann went missing in 2007, and local media have reported that certain people of interest in the case had links to where she vanished from . Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family’s holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. It is now known that between January and May 2007 there had been a four-fold increase in the number of burglaries in the area.","Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe said there has been 'progress' in McCann case .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Carefully stacked on a quayside, this is the huge cocaine haul that has landed one of Britain’s most notorious criminals with a jail sentence of  28 years. Bags of the drug were pulled from the sea after the yacht delivering the £150million  haul to this country capsized in a storm. The man behind the failed smuggling operation was John Allen Brooks, 61, nicknamed ‘the Fixer’. Yesterday his lawyers said he has a heart condition and may die behind bars. Piled high: Bags of cocaine are unloaded from a yacht off the west coast of Ireland, in the harbour at Castletown Bere . Haul: The massive stash of 1.5 tonnes of cocaine that was found on Brooks' boat Dances With Waves . Custody: Brooks was arrested in 2008 after his boat, . Dances With Waves, pictured, which was carrying the drugs haul, was intercepted by . Irish authorities 170 miles (274km) off the south west coast of Ireland . Prison: . John Alan Brooks, 61 was jailed for 28 years after being found guilty . of masterminding a plot to smuggle £134million of cocaine into Britain . Brooks, who has a long history of . involvement in drug crime  and was one of the first British criminals to . flee to the Costa del Sol, tried to smuggle 1.5 tons  of cocaine across . the Atlantic  in 2008. Officers . from the Serious Organised Crime Agency (Soca) tracked the yacht – . Dances With Waves – as it made its way from Venezuela towards the Welsh . coast. They believed that once ashore the cocaine would be distributed from Liverpool. However, the Royal Navy stopped the yacht 170 miles off Ireland after it capsized during a gale-force storm which sent dozens of bags overboard. Brooks, who was not on the yacht, was found guilty of conspiracy to import a class-A  drug and was yesterday jailed for 28 years at Birmingham Crown Court. Recorder Pal Sanghera told him he was a ‘centre point’ for all drug trafficking into this country. ‘You conspired to bring a horrifyingly large amount of cocaine, worth between £140million and £150million on the streets, into the country for no other reason than your own greed. ‘While you were not on the boat, your role was far greater, therefore your crime falls way outside the sentencing guidelines.’ Brooks, who was living in the Benahavis area on the Costa del Sol, was arrested on November 5 last year as he travelled to his native Blackpool to visit relatives.

"By . Sara Malm . and Harriet Arkell . Pictured: Convicted paedophile David Reid, from Belfast, was living in the Algarve, Portugal at the time of the disappearance of Madeleine McCann . A convicted British paedophile was . living in the same area on the Portuguese coast at the time of Madeleine . McCann's disappearance seven years ago, it has been revealed. David Reid moved to Carvoeiro on the Algarve in 2004, after he was released from prison for sexually abusing young girls. He . was still living in the area  in 2007, when three-year-old Maddie was . snatched from her family's holiday apartment while her parents were . having dinner nearby. The . same year Reid arrived on the Algarve, several British families on . holiday suffered break-ins and five young girls were abused in their . beds. Chillingly, just . months before Maddie McCann's disappearance, one of his victims had . warned that Reid remained a threat to young girls and would offend . again. 'It's part of his being. He'll never change,' the victim said, according to The Mirror. 'Get your kids and your family away from him, Never out temptation in front of him. He just won't be able to resist it. Reid, . from Northern Ireland, was living just 30 miles from Praia da Luz, the . holiday resort where the McCann family were staying, in 2007. He . was convicted and jailed for gross indecency and indecent assault in . Belfast in 1995, but was able to move freely and unmonitored in Portugal . as the sex offenders' register was not set up at the time of his . release. According to locals . in Carvoeiro, Reid died last year aged 61 or 62, but his family in . Britain has not been informed of his death, The Mirror reports. The . police investigation into the disappearance of Madeleine McCann took a . step forward last week when detective announced that they . are looking for a prolific paedophile who sexually abused five girls at . holiday homes in the Algarve before the British toddler went missing. The . man, described as tanned, dark-haired and speaking English with an . accent,  is suspected of breaking into holiday properties where British . families were staying and sexually abusing five white British girls aged . between seven and ten, . Still missing: Three-year-old Madeleine McCann disappeared from a Portuguese resort in 2007, close to where Northern Irish paedophile David Reid, pictured playing in The Roundup Bar in Carvoeiro in November  2006, lived . Hideout: David Reid's apartment on the cliffs in Carvoeiro, just 30 miles from Praia da Luz where the McCanns holidayed in 2007 . Reid, who died last year, moved from Belfast to Portugal after he was released from prison where he had served time for sexually assaulting young girls and a boy . The sex attacks took place between 2004-2006, shortly before Madeleine vanished in 2007, and are among a series of 12 break-ins to holiday homes in the Algarve that police believe were committed by the same man. In six of the break-ins, the man sat . on or got into bed with young girls.  On one occasion, he abused two . young girls in the same villa. Two . of the attacks were in the resort of Praia da Luz, where Madeleine was . staying in a holiday apartment with her family when she was taken. There were also four in Carvoeiro, where Reid was living, and six in the Vale da Parra, Praia da Gale district. Most of the attacks took place in low season, police said. They . had previously been discounted by Portuguese investigators because they . are spread over a wide geographical area and there were no apparent . attempts at abduction. Nine . of the 12 incidents were reported to Portuguese police at the time they . happened, and details of three of those became known to British . investigators only after they made televised appeals last autumn. Witnesses . describe the man as having dark, tanned skin with short dark unkempt . hair. He spoke in English with a foreign accent, his voice was described . as slow, or possibly slurred. He was sometimes bare chested, some describe him as having a pot belly, and three victims said that he had a noticeable odour. New clue: Detectives on the Madeleine case say the man they are looking for wore a distinctive burgundy top . Still looking: Madeleine's parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, pictured with an image of how she might look now, were having dinner with friends when 'Maddie' disappeared in Praia da Luz . On . two occasions in Vale de Parra and Praia da Gale he was wearing a . distinctive burgundy long sleeve top, on one of those occasions it was . described as having a white circle on the back. DCI . Redwood said: 'This is an offender who has got a very, very unhealthy . interest in young, white, female children whom he is attacking whilst . they are on holiday in their beds.' Police said the suspect may have been . in the villa or looking round the villa for some time before committing . the offences or being disturbed either by a parent, or the child waking . up, and said he remained calm, even when disturbed. On two occasions, they said, the noise of a bin collection lorry could be heard nearby. DCI . Redwood said today that tracing the man is one of his priority lines . of inquiry. He said: 'We . need to establish the identity of this man - these offences are very . serious and no-one has been charged in connection with them.' He . said some of the offences were previously known about, but three of . them, including what is believed to be the first in the series of 12 . break-ins, were new reports to police and came about as a result of . their appeal for more information last October. Resort: Madeleine went missing from this holiday apartment at the Ocean Club in Praia da Luz in May 2007 . Mr . Redwood's team currently have 38 people classed as 'persons of . interest' to the inquiry, and are also sifting through details of 530 . known sex offenders whose whereabouts they cannot account for.Of those 59 are classed as high priority, and some of those are British. British . investigators have so far sent three international letters of request . to Portuguese authorities over the investigation, covering 41 priority . areas for the team, involving 287 separate requests. Deputy . Assistant Commissioner Martin Hewitt showed his anger at the slow pace . of the legal process, saying: 'That's causing us frustration because we . know what we want to do and we are ready to go with that. But the . process is the process.' Another 30 letters have been written to other European countries, but the force would not reveal where. Madeleine, who was then nearly four, disappeared from her family's holiday apartment in Praia da Luz in the Algarve on May 3 2007 as her parents dined at a nearby restaurant with friends. British detectives launched a fresh investigation into the youngster's disappearance in July last year - two years into a review of the case - and made renewed appeals on television in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany. After shelving their inquiry into Madeleine's disappearance in 2008, Portuguese authorities said last October that a review had uncovered enough new information to justify reopening it.","Convicted paedophile David Reid lived in the area at the time of abduction .

"By . Ruth Styles . Fathers who have a good relationship with their children and are happy to help out with household chores have happier marriages, a new study has revealed. But the survey, conducted by researchers from the University of Missouri and Utah State University, also warned of the pitfalls of divvying up chores between husband and wife, finding that marriages were happier when couples worked together on each job. Men, traditionally, are made responsible for heavier jobs such as taking out the dustbin, while women tend to take on chores such as washing up and hoovering. This, say researchers, is a mistake. Happy: Couples who do the housework together are more likely to have a good relationship . 'We found that it didn't matter who did what, but how satisfied . people were with the division of labour,' said Brigham Young University . professor Erin Holmes. 'We found that when wives are doing work together . with their husbands, they are more satisfied with the division of . labor.' The study, which was published in the Journal of Family Issues, looked at how 160 couples handled housework and child-rearing . duties in an attempt to discover what contributed to the . quality of a married relationship. The quality of the fathers' relationship with their children was found to be the single most important factor, followed by willingness to do the housework alongside their wives. 'For women, their husband having a good relationship with the kids means that the parents are probably going to have a better relationship,' Holmes . said. The study measured fatherly involvement in a number of ways including playing . with children, engaging in shared interests and providing teaching moments. Pitfall: Those who split chores or who don't divide them equally will find marriage harder to cope with . Quality time: Fathers who have a good relationship with their children have happier marriages . 'Something as simple as reading a book with your children every . night and talking with them about their day can really go a long way,"" said Adam Galovan, a graduate of Utah's Brigham Young University who co-authored the study. Most of the parents were between the ages of 25 and 30 and all of the couples had a child age 5 or younger. 'This stage of life, where couples have young children, is potentially really challenging for couples,' Holmes said. Previous research by Holmes showed that both husbands and . wives dramatically increase their household tasks during the transition . to parenthood. Typically fathers do twice as much housework after the first . baby arrives. Mothers, however, do about five times more housework than . before. 'When wives are satisfied with the division of labor, both spouses report higher marital quality,' Holmes said. In other words, couples who clean together, stay together.

"By . Associated Press . A former leader of the Black Panthers has been released from prison more than four decades after being convicted of killing a Baltimore police officer. Marshall 'Eddie' Conway, 67, was freed from the prison in Jessup, Maryland on Tuesday. The decision came after state prosecutors agreed to change his life sentence to time served and probation. Conway is one of dozens of inmates who have been released after Maryland's Court of Appeals ruled in 2012 that judges had given improper instructions to juries before 1980. Scroll down for video . Marshall 'Eddie' Conway, 67, was freed from the prison in Jessup, Maryland on Tuesday after serving four decades for killing a police officer . Marshall 'Eddie' Conway photographed on May 11, 1995, while serving his four decade sentence for murdering police officer Donald Sager in 1970 . Conway was convicted in 1971 of fatally shooting 35-year-old Donald Sager as Sager and another officer sat in a marked patrol car in April 1970. Conway has always denied any participation in the attack, citing the lack of hard evidence in his conviction that was reliant on testimonies of former Black Panthers associate Jack Ivory Johnson, jailhouse informant Charles Reynolds, and Officer Roger Nolan. The Black Panther Party was originally formed in 1966 to protect black neighborhoods from police infringing on their rights. The group strove to empower black communities politically and socially, but was often associated with violence and political discourse. The original Black Panther members were Elbert ""Big Man"" Howard, Huey P. Newton, Sherwin Forte, Bobby Seale,  Little Bobby Hutton, and Reggie Forte. The Black Panther Party expanded to chapters in major cities such as  Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Detroit, Los Angeles, and New York. At the height of the Panthers' notoriety, membership is believed to have peaked at nearly 10,000. The party all but dissolved in 1982 amidst philosophical differences and legal issues. Nolan claimed he had exchanged gunfire with Conway at the time of Sager's slaying. Over the years, Conway received support from the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and local officials. While in prison, Conway founded the Friend of a Friend mentoring program put in place in a number of Maryland prisons to help mentor inmates. Morgan State University even opened the Eddie Conway Liberation Institute last year for students to learn about policy debate while he was still incarcerated. Not everyone is for Conway's early release, most notably Sager's family and police union officials. David Sager, son of the fallen officer, told The Baltimore Sun: 'He rolled over,' in reference to Baltimore's State Attorney Gregg L. Bernstein. 'He didn't up put a fight. I can't stress it enough. Today is a dark day.' At the time of Conway's arrest, he officially served the Baltimore Black Panthers as the Minister of Defense and had suspicions that the group had undercover National Security Agency officials spying on him.

"By . Arthur Martin . Denied: Nicola Edgington, 32, has pleaded not guilty to the murder of Sally Hodkin, 58, and the attempted murder of Kerry Clark, 22 . A schizophrenic patient who stabbed a passer-by to death with a 12in butcher's knife had been released from a secure mental hospital just two years earlier after killing her mother, the Old Bailey heard today. Law firm accounts manager Sally Hodkin, 58, was on her way to work when she suffered a fatal cut to her neck from a butcher’s knife during the attack by Nicola Edgington, who was being treated in the community. Minutes earlier Edgington, who was being monitored by a psychiatrist, nurse and social worker, had attacked another woman, Kerry Clark, but the 22-year-old was able to fight her off. Edgington, 32, had spent just three years in a secure hospital after admitting the manslaughter of her mother Marion, who she stabbed to death in November 2005. The following year she was given an indefinite hospital order and treated as an inpatient before being released in 2009. In October last year, Edgington, of Greenwich, south east London, went on the knife rampage in Bexleyheath, London, after she stopped taking her medication. Her condition had deteriorated and just hours earlier, she was taken to hospital - but walked out before she could be admitted as a voluntary inpatient. She denies murdering Mrs Hodkin, a grandmother, and attempting to murder Miss Clark, now 24. Mark Heywood QC, prosecuting, said: 'She approached and deliberately and viciously attacked each of them without warning, without any provocation. 'She used the weapon forcefully and purposefully in each attack. She was controlled and she was rational.’ Mr Heywood added: 'This case concerns two murderous attacks in the street with large knives. Attack: Meat Market in Bexleyheath where Edgington is alleged to have taken the knife . 'In each case the intention was to kill. The first victim survived because she fought her attacker off and took the knife away. 'The second person attacked, although she tried to defend herself with her bare hands, was unable to achieve that. ‘She was overwhelmed. She died almost immediately from the catastrophic injuries inflicted on her.’ Edgington had earlier made a series of 999 phone calls warning that she was 'dangerous' and wanted to kill someone in the hours before the attacks, the court heard. 'The content of these calls demonstrates that she said repeatedly that she might harm someone,' Mr Hewyood said. Stabbed: Sally Hodkin suffered a fatal cut to the death when she was attack on her way to work . Edgington had been taken to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Woolwich by police at 4.29am after a row with a cab driver in Greenwich. She told a nurse she had ‘not slept for weeks’, was worried about her children, and was hearing voices. Edgington was referred to the psychiatric team at Oxleas House in Greenwich and made the 999 calls while awaiting her transfer. Mr Heywood added: ‘She said she had a mental breakdown. She said she was scared she was dangerous and worried she might kill someone.’ At around 5.30am Edgington also told a psychiatric nurse she needed to be sectioned and an hour later she was taken to the Oxleas unit. She appeared calm but at around 7.05am she said: ‘I’m going to call my care coordinator’ and left the building, jurors heard. Edgington then took a bus to Bexleyheath and went into an Asda store to buy a large knife. At 9.29am she walked out of the store onto the Broadway where people were walking past on their way to work and children were heading to school. Kerry Clark was waiting for a bus to Dartford Heath while listening to music when Edgington confronted her, shouting: ‘You f****** bitch! You f****** bitch!’ Miss Clark fell backwards to avoid the knife and Edgington got on top of her on the ground. ‘The manner of her actions was described by one witness as ferocious,’ said Mr Heywood. ‘Her face was set and angry. ‘There was a struggle. Miss Clark was screaming 'What are you doing?' In a desperate attempt to save her own life, Miss Clark grabbed the blade of the knife firmly with her bare right hand as she wrestled with her attacker. Killed: The house in East Sussex where Marion Edgington's body was found in 2005 . ‘Had she not done so she would surely not have survived. After a few moments she somehow managed to loosen the other’s grip, taking the knife from her grasp and by sheer effort managed to free herself from underneath.’ Miss Clark then stood up and shouted: ‘What the f***’s wrong with you, you crazy b****?’ Edgington replied: ‘I’m not the crazy one - you’re the one with the knife in your hand.’ She demanded her knife back but after a short standoff walked away across the road. She then went into The British Meat Market at 195 Broadway and grabbed a 12-inch knife from a block. Mr Heywood said: ‘With it, she went on until she found another lady. She set upon her with the bigger knife, attacking her with such sustained force that her neck was cut completely open.” Manslaughter: Nicola Edgington stabbed her mother Marion, pictured, to death in 2005 . Edgington says her responsibility was diminished because of her mental state. But the prosecution reject the claim, saying she acted deliberately, intending to kill. Mr Heywood said she was treated as an inpatient for schizophrenia with emotionally unstable personality traits. The prosecution now says she suffers from a borderline personality disorder and her mental state is variable. From September 2009, she was living in a supported flat and, by October 2011, she was under the care of the Bracton Centre in Dartford and was reviewed regularly by a consultant psychiatrist, social supervisor and community psychiatric nurse. Mr Heywood told jurors: ‘The reason that the defendant was being treated as an inpatient between 2006 and 2009 is this - on November 4 2005 she returned from a night out with her brother and sister to their mother’s house. ‘Their mother was there alone. Once there she stabbed her mother and killed her, leaving the property and disappearing for three weeks.’ He said the jury will have ‘to consider the whole history in due course when you analyse her responsibility for her acts on this occasion. ‘One factor is that she has been through it all before. She therefore knew what to expect, what might happen should she kill again.” The trial continues.

Earlier this month the Mail exclusively revealed Scotland Yard had identified three burglars as prime suspects. Scroll down for video . Police investigating the disappearance of Madeleine McCann are understood to be investigating a traveller site not far from the holiday resort from where she disappeared . One theory is that the burglars raided the McCanns’ flat and were panicked into snatching the youngster when she woke up. Analysis of mobile phone data suggests the men were close to the scene of her abduction, at the time she went missing, and were in close contact in the hours that followed. Last week it was reported the three suspects had worked at the resort where Madeleine disappeared. Details of the men’s alleged links to the Ocean Club resort in the Algarve were revealed in Portuguese newspapers with close contacts with local police.

"By . Corey Charlton . This set of pictures shows the incredible interaction between alligators and a group of sanctuary daredevils who swim, wrestle and hand feed the reptiles underwater. Massive alligators are not only wild in the state of Florida but are also considered to be a nuisance - meaning they can be legally killed. But the kind-hearted and fearless staff at the Everglades Outpost in the town of Homestead have taken in all the nuisance alligators they can, averaging around 200 a year. To make money to feed the huge beasts the staff put on daily shows, where they wrestle and hand feed the animals in front of a paying crowd. Scroll down for video . Christopher Gillette works at the alligator sanctuary and has no fear when swimming with the gators. During the shows the reptiles are wrestled and hand fed . Staff such as Mr Gillette capture alligators reported as a nuisance before they are legally killed, saving the animal and then attempting to re-home it . Photographer's assistant Adriana Canargo also felt safe enough to take a swim, pictured here getting up close with a gator and even rubbing the reptile's throat . Wildlife photographer John Chapa, 41 had never before swum with an alligator when he took the plunge and jumped into the 50ft pool. 'The guys at the farm invited me down to take some pictures of them with the gators and said I could get in with them and keep all the pictures I liked. 'For the first ten or 15 minutes I had to acclimatise myself with them but then I figured they didn't want to hurt me so I felt much more comfortable. 'I would swim towards them and they would swim away. Gators only eat once a week and depending on the time of day. They can be quite placid animals. 'They know what is and is not food but they are in no regard tame - you cannot tame a gator.' Mr Gillette posing for a picture with one of his adopted gators - which can grow to be bigger than 3 metres in length depending on their age and sex . Photographer John Chapa said he had never swum with an alligator prior to the photo shoot, but he had dived with sharks for many years and understood wild animals . Staff member Ashley Lawrence, left, pictured with Adriana Canargo, undertakes the hair raising wrestling routine daily for paying crowds at the Florida sanctuary . Christopher Gillette and Ashley Lawrence work at the farm and attempt to re-home each and every alligator in a neighbouring farm or sanctuary - as nuisance gators can never be released back into the wild. They invited Mr Chapa, who lives in Miami Beach, Florida, to the farm to photograph their up-close and personal encounters with the large reptiles. 'It was a really fun day but you can't forget these people do some fantastic work,' he said. 'If a gator shows up at somebody's house or at a BBQ or anywhere else in the state of Florida more than a couple of times then the state will deem it a nuisance. 'There are around 7,000 nuisance alligators reported each year and legally people can then just go out and kill that animal. 'Chris and Ashley will then try to rescue it by hand to avoid hurting it. 'It's a completely non-profit organisation - they do it all just to save the animals.' Photographer John Chapa said he had to spend the first 10 or 15 minutes in the water acclimatising himself to swimming in the presence of the alligators . Staff member and alligator wrestler Christopher Gillette is pictured holding two alligators at once as a less brave looking Adriana Canargo watches on from a distance . He added: 'They allowed us to swim with the animals but that's not normal at the farm. I have dived with sharks for many years so I understand wild animals and it was a great experience. 'My girlfriend was also very comfortable - I think it's just about how you handle gators and you've got to be calm. 'They don't just attack, they need to be hungry or agitated.

"By . Chris Greenwood . Status symbol? Stun guns up to 20 times more powerful are being illegally imported into Britain . Stun guns up to 20 times more powerful than police Tasers are being illegally imported into Britain. The weapons, which can discharge up to one million volts, are highly prized by members of the criminal underworld. An investigation found they can be easily imported into the country via overseas mail order websites. For as little as £60 one German security specialist sold a potentially deadly stun gun without asking any questions about the age or status of the customer. Several days later, the illegal weapon arrived by post. It came with a free can of pepper spray, which is also illegal. Another more powerful weapon, which packs a million-volt punch, cost just £90. Police suspect the stun guns were among hundreds which slip through Customs checks undetected every year. Up to 10,000 such weapons are believed to be in the hands of criminals who use them as a ‘status symbol’, for protection and to enforce debt payments. Electric stun guns are prohibited under the Firearms Act and the maximum penalty for possessing one is ten years’ imprisonment. One police source said: ‘Stun guns are often found during raids on drug dealers. The evidence is that criminals want to own them but they rarely use them. ‘The attraction is they fit in a pocket and can immobilise someone without leaving a permanent injury. Also, even though they are classified as a firearm, the courts sometimes treat people caught with them more leniently than if they had a gun or knife.’ The trade was highlighted in an investigation by the BBC’s Inside Out programme which purchased two devices by mail order. Both weapons, made legally abroad, sailed through specialist Customs checks at Britain’s parcel hubs. At one million volts, one of the guns was 20 times more powerful than the 50,000-volt weapons carried by police. Police issue Taser guns (pictured) fire 50,000 volts, 20 times less powerful than the ones available online and shipped to criminals in Britain for as little as £60 . Metropolitan Police figures  reveal . more than 200 crimes involving the weapons over the past three years in . London alone. They include 139 robberies and more than 50 offences where . people were assaulted or harassed with the weapons. During that period . police in the capital seized 498 stun guns. Eran . Bauer, safety adviser with Civil Defence Supply, which trains police in the use of Tasers,, described the million-volt stun gun as ‘one heck of a brute’. He . said: ‘That’s lightning – horrendous tool. I don’t believe you managed . to get one of these. That is seriously dangerous. ‘You are going to end up with skin burns for a start, and subcutaneous [under the skin] damage. ‘If . it goes into the neck across the nerves you can just imagine the . damage. Hit across the chest then anything could happen – [it could] end . up killing someone.’ The . investigation comes less than 18 months after the Serious Organised . Crime Agency shut down the overseas operation of a US company selling . stun guns and pepper sprays. It was found to be behind almost . three-quarters of all stun guns sent by post to Britain. Former Detective Chief Inspector Pete Kirkham said stun guns  have become the weapon of choice for many criminals. Keith . Vaz MP, chairman of the home affairs select committee, said: ‘How is it . possible to go online and get a gun into this country through what we . are told is one of the most sophisticated borders in the world? ‘I intend to raise the matter with the head of the Border Agency and the Home Secretary.’","Border Agency has no up-to-date figures on number of stun guns stopped .

"By . Sophie Borland . Most GPs think that NHS treatment for migrants is ‘too generous’ and are refusing to register some patients who are in this country illegally. Some doctors warn that surgeries ‘can’t cope’ with the rising numbers of overseas patients coming in for free care, a poll has found. Last year new NHS guidelines told GPs they had to register all foreigners including tourists on short holidays, students and illegal immigrants. Welcome? Most GPs think that NHS treatment for migrants is 'too generous' and refuse to register some patients who are in this country illegally . Once signed up, they would be entitled to the same NHS care as all other patients and can receive free blood tests, jabs and - in some cases - free prescription drugs. But a poll of 229 family doctors by Pulse magazine found that 58 per cent believe these rules are too generous. And 36 per cent will refuse to register patients they suspect are living here illegally - even though they are breaching these new guidelines. One unnamed doctor warned the health service would come under increasing strain next year when thousands of Bulgarians and Romanians arrive to find jobs. It is estimated that as many as 70,000 migrants from these two countries will come to Britain when temporary controls on their numbers expire. The senior GP said: ‘There is an increasing burden of patients coming to the UK who are entitled to treatment - but whether we can afford an open-ended system in the future is a matter for debate. ‘The UK has got to decide what it can and can’t afford and who is eligible. The problem is that everyone tiptoes around the issue. ‘I treat a lot of migrants and asylum seekers, quite happily, but I think there needs to be a public debate. Migration: Bulgarian nationals queuing up outside the British Embassy in Sofia for visa applications in 2006. Up to 70,000 Bulgarians and Romanians are expected to arrive in the country . ‘It’s going to become an increasing issue as we get people from countries like Bulgaria and Romania becoming eligible for NHS treatment in 2014.’ Dr Paul Roblin, a GP who practises in Botley, near Oxford said: ‘You could argue whether it is fair for visitors and migrants to have entitlement to NHS treatment when that is not reciprocated.’ ‘GPs are expected to practise with limited healthcare funding and if we are using that money for treating visitors, the taxpayer loses out. It may be more appropriate to have a system where we say that if you can’t provide proof of residence, you have to pay for treatment.’ The rules regarding overseas patients are extremely complex and even doctors struggle to understand them. By law, such patients are not allowed free hospital treatment - unless urgent -and should be made to pay for x-rays, operations and appointments. But there is concern that once foreign patients are registered with a GP, they can easily access free hospital care as staff rarely check their backgrounds. Figures show that foreign patients owe the NHS £40 million in unpaid hospital bills. Last year nearly 3,600 ‘overseas visitors’ have had hospital operations or treatment worth at least £1,000 a time. The Department of Health is currently reviewing the provision of NHS treatment for foreigners and may decide to charge them for ‘primary care,’ or GP services. A spokesman said: ‘The review is looking at whether we could introduce charges into primary care and how that would work.’","They warn surgeries 'can't cope' with rising numbers of overseas patients .

"By . Sam Webb . Updated: . 13:49 EST, 9 January 2013 . A blushing bride who left her employers' business with 'life-threatening injuries' has been ordered to pay back less than a tenth of the money she stole to pay for her wedding. Kirsty Lane, 30, put 25 jobs at risk when she used her position to siphon off almost £200,000 from the business to pay for the sumptuous ceremony at The Great Hall at Mains. Now, Peter Sutton, company director of Pure AV in Walton Summit, near Preston, said the order to repay just £17, 831 was 'extremely disappointing', adding: 'I hope she has learnt her lesson.' Indulgent: Kirsty Lane, pictured with husband Graham, planned her dream wedding at a Tudor-built hall and laid on a free bar for guests along with two bands and a fireworks display . With magicians, a harpist and a spectacular firework display, no expense was spared for the lavish wedding of Kirsty and Graham Lane. Smiling for the photographer, Lane, looked every bit the happy bride as she tied the knot at the lavish ceremony. But Lane’s smiles hid a secret which was soon to be uncovered - this spectacular celebration was to cost two of her colleagues their jobs and put her employers’ business under threat. She has now been ordered to pay back less than a tenth of the money she stole from the business, which boss Mr Sutton said was left in a difficult position following the fraud. Lane's former boss Peter Sutton (pictured) said that her 'unbridled greed' had almost ruined his audio visual business . He said: 'At the time it had a huge bearing on the operation of the company. 'A few people lost their jobs but we are flourishing now, despite having life-threatening injuries a few years ago. 'It is very disappointing considering she has gained so much and had to pay back so little. 'Her guilt has put at risk 25 people that were involved in this business. 'Thankfully the team that was involved has pulled together and pulled the organisation out of it. 'It hasn’t been easy and that theft in reality cost us around £300,000 but fortunately we are now flourishing.' Lane, of Adlington, was jailed for 20 months after her scam was uncovered within days of her wedding in January 2011. Using her role as a financial administrator, Lane siphoned almost £200,000 from her employers, splashing out on a free bar for her guests, home improvements and even jewel-encrusted iPhone covers for her bridesmaids. But suspicions were aroused when a customer queried an invoice and Lane was suspended pending an investigation. Lane made 122 payments to herself between December 2008 and January 2011, with around £122,000 went into her own account. A further £70,000 went into her husband’s account and a further £6,000 was paid into a third account. Mr Lane was acquitted of any wrongdoing after a retrial in May and Lane herself had 'exonerated' her husband of any wrongdoing. The couple met in 2007 and Mr Lane had travelled up from his home in Luton to move in with the single parent and her daughter in August 2010. At her trial last year Lane pleaded guilty to 10 counts of fraud by abuse of position and asked for a further 112 similar offences to be taken into consideration.

This shadowy street art in Stockholm, Sweden, has turned Snow White into Snow Fright, Sleeping Beauty into Creeping Beauty and Cinderella into Cinder-hell-a. An anonymous Swedish artist, who goes by the name of Herr. Nilsson, has managed to turn some of Disney's best-loved characters into pure evil. Scroll down for video . Deadly Disney: Cinderella has become Cinder-hell-a in this piece of street art by Herr. Nilsson which shows the popular children's character clutching a large knife behind her back . Snow Fright:  An anonymous Swedish artist who goes by the name Herr. Nilsson has turned some of Disney's best-loved characters such as Snow White, pictured, into evil killers in his street art around Stockholm, Sweden . 'There is a lot of creativity in the toy and entertainment industry for children,' said Herr. Nilsson. 'But I've found that most of the cartoon characters, females in particular, are very stereotypical and predictable. 'Everybody expects that a fairy princess will always look good and behave well. 'If I was one of them I would revolt after a couple of days and in my world - they do so.' Each piece of work only takes Herr. Nilsson a few hours each week to complete so he spends most of his time thinking about new ideas for different characters. Herr. Nilsson added: 'Because of my children I'm surrounded by toys, games and movies all the time at the moment. Creeping Beauty: She's known for being a pacifist, but in this image painted on a Stockholm street Sleeping Beauty looks anything but, lurking around a corner holding a large gun . Chill out: Mickey Mouse makes a peace symbol to Osama Bin Laden in the sketch by Herr. Nilsson . 'The characters in these are always so innocent, fair and harmless, and so I set about to create this project of the Dark Disney characters to look at how we see good and bad in the world. 'One of the reasons that I decided to get this across via street art is that I am able to stage a scene in the real world where the piece can interact with the people and the environment. 'I have found this is impossible to do in a traditional art gallery or museum, as the audience know what to expect before they even reach the artwork. 'When you put up a piece of art in the streets, you talk directly to the audience without that prepared shield. 'Most people laugh at the art, some get abuse sprawled on them, and some like to write about them. 'I like this as to me, I think it's good to get a mix of reactions.'

"By . David Martosko In Washington . In an eight-and-a-half minute video message posted on YouTube, House Tea Party Caucus founder and right-wing luminary Michele Bachmann announced Wednesday morning that her career in Congress will end after the 2014 elections. Bachmann, a four-term House member, has represented Minnesota's 6th Congressional District since 2007. 'The law limits anyone from serving as president of the United States for more than eight years,' Bachmann said in her videotaped message. 'And in my opinion - well, eight years is also long enough for an individual to serve as a representative for a specific Congressional district.' SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Bachmann founded the House Tea Party Caucus, and is a stalwart defender of pro-life, anti-gay-marriage and anti-Obamacare initiatives . Bachmann's marathon video sounded at times like a series of disclaimers. She insisted that campaign finance probes and her barely-there victory margin in 2012 were not factors in her decision to forgo a re-election bid in 2014 . Bachmann has been dogged by allegations that she improperly spent money from a Congress-related political action committee to help with her 2012 campaign for the Republican presidential nomination. Former campaign aides first leveled that accusation, and both the Office of Congressional Ethics and the federal Election Commission are investigating. The FBI has also made inquiries into charges that Bachmann's presidential campaign made secret payments to Iowa Republican state Senator Kent Sorenson for help in the run-up to the 2012 Iowa Caucuses. Former Bachmann chief of staff Andy Parrish said in a sworn statement that the congresswoman 'knew and approved' of unethical payments to Sorenson. But Bachmann insisted in her YouTube video that her presidential campaign did nothing wrong. Bachmann was a candidate for the GOP presidential nomination in 2012, but faltered when news surfaced that chronic Migraine headaches limited her ability to manage her day-to-day responsibilities. She bowed out in February 2012 and ran for re-election to Congress with just nine months to campaign . 'It was clearly understood that compliance with all rules and regulations was an absolute necessity for my presidential campaign,' she said, 'and I have no reason to believe that that was not the case.' Bachmann narrowly won re-election last year, beating Democrat Jim Graves by just 4,200 votes, a margin of 1.1 per cent. Graves recently announced that he would run again next year. Bachmann downplayed concerns that she might not be re-elected if she were to run again in 2014. 'My decision was not in any way influenced by any concerns about my being re-elected to Congress,' she said. 'If I ran I would again defeat the individual who I defeated last year.' A Republican strategist told MailOnline early Wednesday morning that the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee would be hard pressed to put resources into a 2014 Bachmann campaign, and suggested that her pre-emptive withdrawal was at least in part related to fears that she couldn't win again without resources from her party. HAPPIER TIMES: Bachmann appeared on 'Late Night With Jimmy Fallon' in November 2011, during the Republican presidential primary season. Former campaign aides have since accused her of making unethical payments to an Iowa state legislator for help with her failed Iowa Caucus effort . 'Bachmann has a less than 50-50 chance of winning again, and she knows it,' that GOP strategist said. 'She's probably bowing out gracefully so the RNC has plenty of time to find another candidate. That way if she ever runs for office again - say, for governor of Minnesota - she won't have to worry about bridges she burned.' Bachmann did leave open that possibility in her video. 'There is no future option or opportunity- be it directly in the political area or otherwise - that I won’t be giving serious consideration if it can help save and protect our great nation for future generations,' she said.","Bachmann is being investigated for misusing congressional campaign funds to aid her failed presidential bid .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Charged: Alicia D Brown was arrested for child abuse after her little girl was found alone in a car . A Maryland mother who left her four-year-old child in a casino parking lot for eight hours has been charged with child abuse. Alicia D Brown was spotted on security camera footage arriving in the parking garage at 10am on December 1. Security guards found the little girl after hearing her crying at about 6.30pm. She was alone in the car, which had blankets taped up around the windows. As police prepared to remove the child, who was cold and hungry, the mother returned and was arrested. She had been seen entering the casino area on cameras shortly after parking her car on the fourth level of the garage. Temperatures were close to freezing on Tuesday but apart from being cold, the child appeared to be healthy and there were no signs of physical abuse. The girl was taken to a medical center for a check up after being found in a state of distress. Brown was not working at the casino, but it was unclear if she had returned to check on the child during the day, according to the Baltimore Sun. The 24-year-old, from Baltimore, has been charged with child abuse, confining an unattended child and neglect of a minor. She was being held on a $150,000 bond and her daughter has been handed over to a relative. Police spokesman Lieutenant TJ Smith told WBalTV: 'I don't care if they had that whole car set up like a day care center. That child should not be left alone in a car by herself.' Alone: The four-year-old girl was found in a parking garage of Maryland Live! casino on December 31 . He added: '[This is] parental selfishness, absolute stupidity, just a reckless, reckless abandonment.' Casino president Rob Norton told News4: 'Incidents of parental neglect and lack . of personal responsibility are disturbing.' He added: 'We are thankful that our . security team was able to intervene and get the appropriate authorities . involved and that we found the child unharmed.'","Alicia Brown was seen arriving in parking garage at 10am .

"By . Rachel Reilly . Sarah Thomas died at home because her symptoms were not taken seriously by paramedics . A dental nurse died after 'serious failings' by paramedics called to her home, a coroner ruled today. Sarah Thomas, 30, was found dead just six hours after ambulancemen told her she didn't need to go to hospital, despite being 'barely conscious'. An inquest heard she would have survived if she had been taken to hospital - and been given simple injections. Her father, Kenneth Thomas, told the hearing he was with her when she was examined by paramedics David Glover and Michael Davies. 'Sarah looked very distressed and could hardly speak - she was conscious but was not with it totally,' he said. 'There was a discussion about hospitals, but the paramedics said: ""You are better off here Sarah, this is the best place for you"",' he added. 'We were persuaded in their arguments that she was in the best place and she did not need to be sitting in an ambulance. We accepted the situation as it was.' The . inquest heard the paramedics left Sarah's home in Port Talbot at 1.40am . on 5 May 2007. She was found dead in the bathroom at 7.30am. The inquest in Neath, South Wales, heard Sarah was battling the after-effects of a brain tumour when an ambulance was called. Coroner Philip Rogers said there was conflicting evidence by the paramedics and Sarah's parents Kenneth and Madeline. He said: 'There were serious failings in the way in which the crew went about their assessment and recording her condition that night.' These included an inappropriate . method used to assess respiratory rate, no attempt to listen to Sarah's . chest with a stethoscope and no assessment of her abdomen. 'The blood pressure is likely to have . been inaccurate and there was a failure to get details of the long-term . medication Sarah was taking. Guilty: The inquest found that paramedics were responsible for Sarah's death . 'If Sarah had been taken to hospital . it was likely she would have received intravenous hydrocortisone . injections and fluids, and her death would not have occurred.' 'But given the crew's lack of knowledge and the rarity of Sarah's condition, this cannot be labelled as gross failings.' A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesman said: 'We will be giving full and urgent consideration to the coroner's narrative verdict to ensure that all opportunities are taken to continuously improve our service.'","Sarah Thomas, 30, was barely conscious when paramedics arrived .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . You may think that people living 100 years ago in cities of smog and steam-powered machinery could scarcely imagine our modern world today. And yet old postcards drawn by artists reveal scarily accurate predictions of 21st century gadgets from the vacuum cleaner and FaceTime, to large submarines. The intriguing colour sketches, called En L’An 2000 (In the Year 2000), look strangely familiar despite being created between 1899 and 1910. The future is calling: Over 100 years ago, French artists drawing scenes for cigar boxes dreamed up futuristic gadgets such as this cine-phono-telegraph, which allows people to speak over the telephone and see each other on a screen at the same time - much like Skype and Apple's FaceTime . The quirky cards show a host of recognisable scenes including one picture, called Correspondance Cinema-Phono-Telegraphique, which depicts a man relaxing in a chair while he makes a video phone call - akin to Skype or Apple's FaceTime, which people rely on today. The mechanical forerunner to the iPod – an automated orchestra - is included in the scenes, as well as a futuristic dictation machine designed to allow important businessmen to dictate notes and letters without the need for a secretary. Face to face: The old postcards drawn by artists over 100 years ago reveal scarily accurate predictions of 21st century gadgets - including video phone calls, such as FaceTime (pictured) Skating on thin ice? The French artists envisioned a snowmobile which would allow people to explore Antarctica and see the penguins (pictured). Today, numerous vehicles can traverse the hostile icy terrain and holidays are even offered for tourists to see the wildlife and vast icebergs . Music to our ears: The mechanical forerunner to the iPod - an automated orchestra, is pictured. Automatons and music boxes were popular in the 19th century, but a system to provide enough volume for a theatre (pictured) was a dream . Meals on wheels: As soon as the weather is warm enough, a stream of RVs and caravans can be found trundling down to the seaside and scenic spots. But this was a novel idea 100 years ago and the artists imagined a literal mobile home, complete with a chimney, fine dining on a balcony and a mobile garden . Another image, entitled A bord d’un Paquebot sous-marin, shows a couple observing marine life through a giant window which bears more than a slight resemblance to the aquariums we have today – or perhaps the underwater observatory which is currently home to Fabien Cousteau who is living underwater for a month. Dreaming of another age of exploration, . the artists also penned scenes of people living in a submarine, . travelling from Paris to Peking by train and using a snowmobile to see . the penguins of the South Pole. All at sea: Shipwrecks and accidents still happen today, but the artists envisioned a specially-equipped flying machine that could reach sailors in peril in even the worst weather conditions (pictured) A high flier: Today, search and rescue helicopters patrol remote coastlines and can swoop down and hover close to the water's surface to rescue marooned sailors, as well as people stuck on rocky headland (pictured) Back to the future: This postcard shows a couple waterskiing - or even using skis that work a little like Back to the Future's hover boards. Interestingly, while the leisure equipment is futuristic, the people are still wearing traditional clothing of the 19th century . Great Scott! Scientists are still working on creating technology that flies like the hover board seen in Back to the Future 2 (pictured) and they can now levitate and tiny particles . Take this down: No important businessman or industrialist would be without his own mechanical Dictaphone in the year 2,000, according to the artists. Here, a high flier talks to a machine to record his thoughts instead of using a secretary - a process we have been familiar with for several decades . Another drawing, entitled Les Patins Cloches a Eau, shows a couple water-skiing in an image, which wouldn’t look entirely out of place today if it wasn’t for the vintage clothing. They even resemble the hoverboards from the film Back to the Future. In a different scene, called Un Frotteur electrique, a happy maid watches as an electronically-powered broom sweeps the floor in a historic vision of the vacuum cleaner. Life aquatic: This image, entitled A bord d'un Paquebot sous-marin, shows a couple observing marine life through a giant window, which bears more than a slight resemblance to the aquariums we have today, or even underwater laboratories used for studying marine animals . Getting their skates on: This image, entitled Auto-Patins a Roues, is a vision of futuristic powered roller skating, where each skate has a motor attached. The artist who drew the scene even foresaw accidents - as seen when wearing similar gadgets that exist today . Wheely great: They may not look like the powered roller skates in the 19th century picture, but these modern skates let people glide along with no effort at all as they are battery powered . How illuminating: This scene, Un Palais oceanien, shows a futuristic exploration of the underwater world by means of a submarine shining beams of light in the darkness. Today, navies around the world use submarines that can stay under water for months and personal vessels allow individuals to explore the sea floor . Sketches of gadgets designed to make womens’ lives easier, also include a kitchen full of machines, some of which we take for granted. For example, most modern kitchens have ovens, blenders and drinks makers, and soon we could be doing our grocery shopping directly from a smart fridge or using a smart cooker. The postcards were originally published in France and distributed inside cigar boxes. Interestingly, while the artists dreamed up whimsical machines, there were more conservative when it came to people's clothes, as the figures in the drawings are dressed in their 19th century finest. The dream clean machine: This  postcard shows a happy maid watching as an electronically powered broom sweep the floor. It would appear that the artists predicted the invention of the modern vacuum cleaner - although did not foresee that most families would be cleaning their houses themselves . All abroad for the year 2,000: Dreaming of an age of exploration, the artists penned scenes of people living in a submarine and travelling from Paris to Peking by train (pictured). The engine has a nose that resembles a fighter jet . Full steam ahead: The 19th century may be regarded by some as the golden age of rail travel, when steam engines meant that more people could travel longer distances more comfortably. But today, trains can cross continents and Russian Railways offers a journey from Paris to Beijing (formerly known as Peking).  We are even working on concepts like Hyperloop which could travel at 760 mph (1,220 km/h) Voila! Artists seem to have predicted the voicemail. A Missive phonographique - or futuristic recorded message, is brought on a tray by a servant (pictured). Today the service comes neatly built in to most phones . They were created by a variety of artists including Jean Marc Côté, and were designed to show  visions of the world 100 years into the future. At least 87 different cards were produced with sets being printed in 1899, 1900 and finally in 1910. This is the news: In the future, French artists imagined that people could listen to the newspaper - much like a radio news bulletin. They did not predict the television or MailOnline though for keeping people up to date with what's going on in the world . Floating like a butterfly: Un Hydroplane - a futuristic hydroplane, can be seen skimming along the surface of the sea. Today, we still use this method of transportation and it has been adapted for land too . A kitchen fit for Heston Blumenthal? The French artists imagined a world where people did less of the chores themselves and kitchen were packed with gadgets. Most modern kitchens have ovens and drinks makers (pictured) and soon we could be doing our grocery shopping directly from a smart fridge . The appliance of science: Our kitchens are getting smarter all the time with ovens (pictured) able to be turned on using phone apps, or able to offer recipes, while fridges can use Wi-Fi connections to order groceries .","Sketches called En L’An 2000 were drawn between 1899 and 1910 in France .

"By . Sam Webb . Up to 70,000 Bulgarians and Romanians will travel to Britain each year when they finally gain open access to the jobs  market, a report claims today. Almost 29million people from the two countries will be free to work in Britain from the end of this year when temporary controls on new EU migrants expire. But although ministers have their own estimate of the scale of the influx, they refuse to reveal it. The figure is likely to be the crucial factor in deciding whether the Government will hit the Prime Minister’s goal of cutting net migration – the difference between those arriving and leaving each year – to ‘tens of thousands’ A Roma community in Bulgaria. Both Bulgaria and Romania are relatively poor, rendering employment in the UK an attractive prospect . The report by the pressure group MigrationWatch says Romanians and Bulgarians will add between 30,000 and 70,000 to our population in each of the next five years. This is partly based on the events of 2004 when immigration soared after Poland and seven other nations joined the EU. The report estimates an average of 50,000 Romanians and Bulgarians will arrive here each year, a total of 250,000. But it warns the figure could soar if Roma gipsies or the nearly 1million Romanians already in other EU countries also come. Romania and Bulgaria joined the EU in 2007, but the number who could take jobs here was capped at 25,000 for low-skilled workers. That limit expires this year. Migration: Bulgarian nationals queuing up outside the British Embassy in Sofia for visa applications in 2006 . The study explains why Britain is likely to be attractive to Romanians and Bulgarians. Both are relatively poor with a minimum wage of around £1 an hour, compared to £6.19 here, and income per head of about a fifth of Britain’s. In addition, destinations such as Spain, Italy and France have high youth unemployment. The UK also offers full benefits when immigrants find work, including housing and child benefit and child tax credit. MigrationWatch chairman Sir Andrew Green said: ‘It is not good enough to duck making an estimate of immigration. It is likely to have significant consequences for housing and services. It will also add to the competition young workers face.’ David Cameron indicated he did not have confidence in Government figures, saying the estimated influx of around 14,000 Poles in 2004 turned out to be ‘ridiculously low’. The Home Office said it was looking at ‘factors that may encourage EU nationals to come to the UK’.","Migration watchdog says workers will be attracted by higher wages and benefits .

"By . Jill Reilly . Madeleine McCann's mother has ploughed £1million from book sales back into the search for her missing daughter. The bestseller, entitled Madeleine by Kate McCann, was published in 2011 on the day of her eighth birthday. Madeleine, who was three, disappeared from her bed in the family’s apartment in Praia da Luz on the evening of May 3, 2007, while her parents were eating at a nearby tapas restaurant – as they did every night of the holiday.

After tax the book netted £738,487 providing a much-need boost to the fund set up by the McCanns, reported the Mirror. Madeleine’s Fund hit £1.8million shortly after the three-year-old . vanished from her family’s holiday. But by 2011, after four years of searching, it had dwindled to £125,000. Official papers filed with Companies House show all the money raised from the 384-page book went to the fund. The fund’s directors said: 'Income from the book has significantly improved the position.

The photo on the right was used in the campaign to find her . 'This will continue as a result of publication in other countries and the release of the paperback.' The continuing search and costly advertising campaigns means the remaining total now stands at £474,86. In the searingly honest book Kate McCann explains she thought it would be 'unwise' to leave her three children with a babysitter on the night they dined at the resort restaurant. Explaining why they did not make use . of the babysitting service offered by the Ocean Club, she said the . couple never even thought about it. She said: 'I could argue that leaving . my children alone with someone neither we nor they knew would have been . unwise, and it's certainly not something we'd do  at home, but we . didn't even consider it. 'We felt so secure we simply didn't think it was necessary.'

However British police later told the . couple their holiday apartment, being a corner flat on the ground . floor, next to two roads and with secluded entrances, made it a perfect . target for criminals.

"By . Martin Robinson . Probe: Tory MP Nadine Dorries's travel and accommodation expenses are to be probed by The Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority . Controversial Tory politician Nadine Dorries is being investigated over her MP's expenses. The Tory, who is MP for Mid-Bedfordshire, is being probed for claims made for accommodation and travel, watchdog the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (Ipsa) announced today . Ms Dorries had previously been investigated in 2010 where she agreed to pay back £1,000. She was also threatened with expulsion from the Conservative party last year after deciding to go on I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here! in the Australian jungle. Ipsa's compliance officer Peter Davis said he had reason to believe Ms Dorries may have been paid travel and accommodation costs she was not entitled to. 'An investigation will be conducted into claims submitted under the following areas of the third and fourth editions of the MPs’ scheme of business costs and expense - accommodation expenditure, travel and subsistence,' he said in a statement. Just this morning Ms Dorries tweeted that she was taking some holiday as Parliament broke for its half term recess. 'I'm taking a break from Twitter for the half term week and spending some time getting some fresh air with my three girls. #bonding', she wrote. A defiant Ms Dorries vowed to 'go after' Ipsa, claiming the expenses body had simply targeted a high-profile MP to justify its funding. She insisted she was 'totally relaxed' about the allegations, saying they were completely unfounded. One relates to a travel ticket claim that was submitted twice in error by a member of staff who had accidentally 'pressed the button twice', she said. 'Ipsa was asleep on the bloody job not filtering out claims like that,' she added. Centre of probe: Nadine Dorries, pictured leaving her home yesterday, will have to answer the expenses watchdog's questions . Tweet: Ms Dorries said this morning she was taking a break to spend time with her family over half term . Furious: Backbencher Nadine Dorries, pictured in the Commons, has pledged to 'go after' Ipsa and accused them of pursuing her . Ms Dorries said Ipsa was also accusing her of subletting her flat because an electricity bill for a three-month period when her daughter was home from university was higher than her normal bills. 'I have never misclaimed one penny on my expenses,' she said. Ms Dorries remains suspended from the Tory whip following her appearance last year on ITV's I'm A Celebrity Get Me Out of Here!. She added: 'They need a high-profile MP to go after to justify their millions in funding. Well I'm going to go after them. 'All they want to do is get attention to show Ipsa is doing its job.' Controversial: Ms Dorries went into the jungle to talk about abortion issues and life as an MP but she also took part in several grim challanges . Ms Dorries claimed to have had permission to take time off from Westminster to go to Australia from then-Chief Whip Andrew Mitchell but admitted she did not tell him it was to take part in the show. She also claimed that other MPs have also taken long spells away from Westminster. She attacked Labour MP Stephen McCabe on Twitter for reporting her to the standards commissioner, telling him his own attendance rate was just 63 per cent. But he responded, pointing out that he had taken time off to recover from having open heart surgery. Mr McCabe wrote on Twitter: 'Imagine equating time off for open heart surgery with a paid for holiday on a reality TV show. Says all we need to know.' But Ms Dorries was unrepentant, replying: 'I think with your 63% attendance record, you should be quiet. Obvioulsy been taking a few holidays of your own!' The Mid Bedfordshire MP claimed she wanted to use her appearance on I'm A Celebrity to discuss political issues, including lowering the abortion limit, in front of a TV audience of millions. But none of the political conversations were aired. Instead she was seen eating an ostrich anus and camel toe in a Bushtucker Trial and performing a series of bad jokes with Linda Robson from Birds of a Feather.","Watchdog Ipsa has 'reason to believe' Ms Dorries 'may have been paid travel and .

"By . Ian Drury . and Tim Shipman . David Cameron refused to rule out military action yesterday as he rebuked Argentina over its grab for the Falkland Islands. The Prime Minister vowed the UK would ‘do everything’ to protect the interests of the territory after Buenos Aires demanded he hand power to them.

The remarks came after Argentina’s president Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner launched a fresh attack by insisting her nation was ‘forcibly stripped’ of the Falklands in a ‘blatant exercise of 19th century colonialism’ – a claim branded ‘crazy’ by Whitehall officials. In an open letter to Mr Cameron, published as an advert in Left-wing newspapers on the 180th anniversary of the alleged January 1833 takeover, she accused the UK of defying United Nations resolutions by refusing negotiations over the Falklands. But in a strong message which risked angering Buenos Aires, Number 10 made clear Britain would respond with force if threats to the islands emerged. A source said: ‘This is not a military situation but there is no doubt that we can defend the islands. The people of the Falkland Islands should be just left alone.’ Falkland Islanders last night issued their own open letter addressed to the Argentinean president. In . the 1830s Britain was arguably at the height of its colonial power. The . jewel in the crown was India while Canada, Australia as well as key . parts of Africa including Egypt and the Cape Colony were all under the . Union Flag. In . South America, Britain captured three colonies from the Dutch in 1796 . which were officially ceded in 1814, and consolidated into a single . colony, known as British Guiana in 1831. The . period between 1815 and 1914, is often referred to as Britain's . 'imperial century' with around 10,000,000 square miles of territory and . roughly 400 million people were added to the British Empire. After the defeat of Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815, Britain's only serious international rival was Russia. Overwhelming . naval supremacy led to a state of affairs known as 'Pax Britannica', . with Britain adopting the role of global policeman and enjoying a . foreign policy dubbed 'splendid isolation'. Because . Britain exerted such influence in world trade, the economies of . countries such as China and Argentina were effectively controlled from . London. The term 'informal empire', is used by historians to describe . this state of affairs. A group labelling themselves Falklands United said: ‘We look forward to our referendum in March and failure on your part to accept the outcome will prove to the world that there is only one colonial power in the region.’ The letter added: ‘We have never been prouder of our association with the United Kingdom and our unique relationship. Any decision to change that would be OUR and not YOUR choice.’ Britain has four warships, four RAF fighter-bombers and a 1,000-strong garrison on the Falklands, which are still claimed by Argentina despite their crushing defeat in the 1982 war which cost 255 British lives. Mr Cameron insisted the islanders should be granted the right to self-determination under the UN. He said: ‘They’re holding a referendum this year and I hope the president of Argentina will listen to that referendum and recognise it is for the Falkland Islanders to choose their future.’ Dick Sawle, a member of the Falklands’ Legislative Assembly, said: ‘The letter sent by president Kirchner is not only historically inaccurate but fails to mention the most significant aspect of our recent history – the attempt by Argentina to take away our home by military force when they invaded.’ Diplomatic friction between Britain and Argentina has increased since 2010, when the Government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands. Last year Buenos Aires accused the UK of ‘militarising’ the South Atlantic after Prince William’s posting as an RAF search-and-rescue helicopter pilot. Diplomats believe president Kirchner is using sovereignty claims to deflect attention from unpopular social and economic policies. The International Monetary Fund has also threatened to expel the country for cloaking in secrecy its inflation and growth data. Britain's Foreign Office rejected . Fernandez's call for negotiations, sticking to London's long-established . stance that the approximately 3,000 people of the Falkland Islands had . chosen to be British. 'There are three parties to this . debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders can't . just be written out of history,' the Foreign Office said. 'As such, there can be no . negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falkland Islands unless and until . such time as the islanders so wish.' The British Task force reached the South . Atlantic in May 1982 and retook South Georgia before preparing to . retake the main Islands. The Argentinean Air force sank several British ships, and Exocet . missiles sank the destroyer HMS Sheffield and the Atlantic Conveyor. A copy of Argentine President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner's letter to David Cameron . The Falklands: Diplomatic friction between Britain and Argentina has intensified since 2010, when the Government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands . Many other ships were damaged, some badly with considerable loss of . life, but the sinking of Argentinean Cruiser the General Belgrano by  a . British Submarine was considered a turning point. The British fought . their way across the island with an Argentine surrender on June  14, . 1982. The British lost 250 men and  took more than 10,000 prisoners of war, . while the Argentines lost 746, of which 368 had been on the Belgrano . when it sank. Fernandez said her open letter was . timed to coincide with the 180th anniversary of the day when Argentina . was 'forcibly stripped' of the islands in what she called a 'blatant . exercise of 19th century colonialism'. Noting that the islands were located . 14,000 km (8,700 miles) from London, Fernandez accused Britain of . expelling Argentines from the islands and carrying out a 'population . implantation process'. Britain disputes that version of . history. It says no civilian population was expelled from the Falklands . on or after Jan. 3, 1833. Fernandez's allegations were made in an open letter addressed to David Cameron and UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon. They are the latest in a string of . inflammatory rants over the islands’ future and come less than ten weeks . before around 1,500 eligible islanders hold the first ever vote on . whether they want to remain British. The referendum set for March  10-11, . overseen by international observers, is widely expected to send a clear . message to Argentina to keep its hands off. That . would be a humiliation for President Kirchner who has used sovereignty . claims to deflect attention from unpopular social and economic policies.

President  Fernandez shows a plaque with the name 'Islas Malvinas' (left) and a  man sets fire to an effigy of Prince William during a commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the Falklands War in April last year . It would also underpin the UN principle of ‘self-determination’ for the people of the Falklands. In . the letter, President Kirchner said Argentina was ‘forcibly stripped’ of the islands it calls Las Malvinas in a ‘blatant exercise of 19th . century colonialism’. She added that ‘Argentines on the islands were . expelled and the UK began a population implementation process similar to . that applied to other territories under colonial rule’. Recipient: The President's letter was also addressed to UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon . She added: ‘Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic.’ The Foreign Office ‘strenuously denied’ the claims and accused Argentina of trying to ‘write the Falkland islanders out of history’. Whitehall sources said the Government could order Sir Mark Lyall Grant, Britain’s ambassador to the UN, to rebut the ‘crazy’ allegations. In a speech to the UN last year, Sir Mark criticised Argentina’s ‘aggressive territorial aspirations’ over the Falklands and said its claims were ‘without foundation’. He said: ‘No civilian population was expelled on 3 January 1833 and the United Kingdom has never implanted any civilian population.’ Diplomatic friction between Britain and Argentina has intensified since 2010, when the Government authorised oil exploration in the waters near the islands. The letter was published in the Guardian and the Independent newspapers. It appears to have provoked an angry reaction from some islanders. Several messages have appeared on Twitter purporting to be from islanders condemning the papers' decision to publish them. One message to the Guardian read: 'Any particular reason why you continue to publish literature from someone that refuses to accept our existence?'","Open letter appears in the Guardian and Independent newspapers .

"By . Kerry Mcdermott . The new Archbishop of Canterbury has indicated his support for a professional standards body to help clean up the banking industry. The Rt Rev Justin Welby made the remarks as he described the 'culture of entitlement' affecting parts of the City of London and disconnecting it from 'what people saw as reasonable in the rest of the world'. The archbishop, a member of the cross-party Banking Standards Commission, also hinted that the Government may need to recapitalise at least one major bank, and called for the creation of regional banks to help parts of the country outside of London flourish. Scroll down for audio . 'Culture of entitlement': The Archbishop of Canterbury hinted at his support for a professional banking body to enforce standards in the financial industry . The spiritual leader of the world's Anglicans said on BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster that 'serious consideration' should be given to the creation of a professional banking body similar to the General Medical Council to enforce standards. Describing banks as 'incredibly complicated things', the archbishop told the Financial Times' political editor George Parker: 'The idea that people can hold hugely responsible positions in them without any kind of formal training seems to a number of us to be quite surprising.' Asked whether he . saw it as part of his mission to try to inject more morality into . British financial life, the archbishop said: 'My key mission is to lead the church in worshipping Jesus Christ . and encouraging people to believe in him and follow him. That's my . mission. '... Issues of how the City of London, which is . so important and so full of very gifted people, how that behaves in . relation to the common good is very key,' he added. Bankers: The archbishop said it seemed 'surprising' that people could hold hugely responsible positions in banks without any formal training . The archbishop returned to the theme of the country's . financial woes in the radio interview following his warning on Monday that . Britain is in an economic depression and could take a generation to . recover. He said then . that it would take something 'very major' to restore confidence and drag . the country out of the mire. Asked whether he minded ruffling a few feathers, he said: 'I don't know if it annoyed people in Number 10. They haven't said anything here. I mean they probably would have preferred it not said. 'Historically depressions have been recognised as lengthy periods in which the economy did not get back to its previous level of activity before a recession set in. So 1929 to 1932 is the great example. 'We are still significantly below where we were in 2007 in terms of economic activity, of GDP, and that's quite a long time of being below. 'Now, I'm not pointing any fingers at anyone in particular and saying it's so and so's fault or so and so's fault, it's simply a measurable fact coming from the national statistics.' The Archbishop denied a suggestion that he meant that the bank to be recapitalised was the Royal Bank of Scotland, saying he would not name a bank. He added: 'I think the principle is that we need more regional banking. The appeal of regional banking is first that you have slightly smaller banks. I'm not talking about mini banks. 'Again, the evidence we've heard is that once you go over about a hundred billion pounds of balance sheet there are no economies of scale. If any there are diseconomies of being too big and the costs of that. And secondly, as a regional bank, inevitably you get a commitment to your local region to making it flourish. If you're a long way away from somewhere you have less emotional commitment to that area. 'The idea that has been suggested recently that that will result in sort of crony banking where, you know, regions just look after their own in a modern regulated environment, is completely absurd,' the archbishop said.","Archbishop said bankers should have to pass exams to raise standards .

"By . Sara Malm . Iran’s oil and gas revenues have dropped by a dramatic 45 per cent since sanctions were imposed by the West over it’s nuclear development programme. The restrictions came into force in July under which the EU put a complete embargo on oil and gas from Iran, which eliminated 18 per cent of Iran’s export, and has led to financial collapse. The result of these and further banking and trade sanction over the refusal to halt uranium enrichment, has seen oil exports drop 40 per cent in the last nine months, compared to the corresponding period last year, a senior lawmaker said. Losing trade: Iranian oil workers work at one of Tehran's oil refineries which have been hit badly by the 45 per cent drop in sales revenues and 40 per cent drop in total exports . The financial crisis has led to an inflation in the rial, which in October last year had lost over half of its value against the U.S. dollar. Iran's June oil exports of 1.74 million barrels a day plunged to 1 million barrels a day in July when the sanctions were imposed, The International Energy Agency said. The IEA said exports picked up to about 1.3 million barrels a day in November, but the future is still grim for a nation where crude oil exports account for nearly 80 percent of its foreign revenue. Gholam Reza Kateb, head of the parliament's budget committee, confirmed the total reduction in oil and gas revenue. He said: ‘On the basis of the report, oil sales are down 40 per cent and income has dropped 45 per cent in the last nine months.’ Mr Kateb said details of the steep . revenue drop emerged Monday in a report by Oil Minister Rostam Qasemi to . the parliament on the status of crude oil and liquid gas sales. Mr . Kateb added that Iranian experts are predicting that the country will . be able to export 1.5 million barrels of oil a day over the next year and hope to increase the country's export of oil byproducts as a way of bypassing the sanctions. Oil dependents: An oil refinery and petrochemical complex is seen in the port of Mahshahr, Iran, a country where 80 per cent of foreign revenue comes from crude oil exports . Barreling down: Iran's sales of oil plummeted last summer but has yet to make a full recovery as sanctions are still imposed on the nation . Restricting power: The sanctions were imposed as a result of Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad's refusal to halt his nuclear programme . The Iranian government is preparing to . present an austerity budget to parliament for the next Iranian calendar . year, begining March 21, which would substantially increase income taxes . as a way of avoiding a budget deficit. Iran is under U.N. sanctions and Western oil, banking and trade restrictions as the U.S. and its allies believe Iran might be on a path toward producing nuclear bombs. Iran insists its nuclear program is peaceful, aimed at generating electricity and producing radioisotopes to treat about 1 million cancer patients a year.","Drop in oil revenues for Iran since Western sanctions were imposed in July .

"By . David Mccormack . Pakistani national Abid Naseer has finally been extradited to the U.S. on terrorism charges after a two year legal fight . Police in Britain have extradited a terror suspect to the United States to face charges that he took part in an alleged al-Qaeda plot to detonate explosives on the New York City subway system in the biggest plot since the September 11 attacks. Authorities handed Abid Naseer, 26, over to U.S. authorities on Thursday. Prosecutors want Naseer to stand trial in the U.S. for his alleged role in a terror campaign that would have struck targets in Britain and Norway as well as New York. Pakistani-national Naseer was arrested . in the U.K. in 2010 after being indicted in the U.S. on terrorism . charges. He has been fighting his extradition since then. U.S. prosecutors told a British court hearing his extradition case two years . ago that they plan to prove that Naseer collected bomb ingredients, . conducted reconnaissance and communicated with al-Qaeda operatives. The . alleged activities were part of the foiled New York plot and another . plot to bomb a shopping area in the northern English city of Manchester. Naseer . had been originally arrested on suspicion of terrorism in 2009. He was . one of 12 men held in Manchester, but the men were later released . because of a lack of evidence and a severely compromised investigation. Naseer is expected to appear in Federal District Court in Brooklyn on Monday. The indictment came as part of a larger case involving three men from Queens - Najibullah Zazi, Adis Medunjanin and Zarein Ahmedzay - who were convicted of meeting with al-Qaeda operatives in Pakistan in September 2008 and returning to the United States and plotting to bomb New York subways. U.S. authorities believe that Naseer was involved in a plot to blow up the New York City subway . Naseer is believed to have been in touch with the same senior al-Qaeda commanders. The cases were linked by what court . papers described as a common 'Qaeda facilitator' in Peshawar, Pakistan, . who prosecutors said used the same e-mail account to send coded messages . to Zazi in the U.S. and to Naseer in Britain. Like the three men from Queens, Naseer spent time in Peshawar in late 2008. Naseer, who originally came to Britain on a student visa, took his fight to remain in the UK to the European Court of Human Rights after exhausting his appeal options. His extradition comes not long after the radical cleric Abu Hamza and four other suspects were deported to the US to face terrorism charges. Najibullah Zazi, left, and Adis Medunjanin have already been convicted of plotting to bomb New York subways .",After a two-year legal battle Abid Naseer was handed over to U.S. authorities on Thursday .
"By . Jason Groves . Planning Minister Nick Boles is locked in a furious row with the head of the National Trust - after accusing him of selfishly campaigning against new housing while owning ‘at least’ two homes himself. In a highly personal clash on BBC Two’s Newsnight programme, Mr Boles repeatedly challenged Sir Simon Jenkins to say how many properties he owns. It comes as the government stepped up its rhetoric on the need to accelerate housebuilding on green fields. During a heated debate on Newsnight, Nick Boles (left) asked Simon Jenkins (right) how many properties he owns . Sir Simon, chairman of the National Trust, ducked the question and angrily pointed out that he was helping to contribute towards the cost of Mr Boles’s taxpayer-funded second home in Lincolnshire. ‘Simon, how many houses do you own?’ Mr Boles demanded. ‘I’m paying for your houses, bloody hell,’ Sir Simon responded. During a heated debate Sir Simon accused the minister of adopting a policy of ‘let’s let rip and let money determine it - let’s bribe anyone we can to build houses’. He added: ‘That’s not the way to do planning.’ Sir Simon said there were already enough sites to build two million new homes ‘right now’. He went on: ‘Selling planning permissions through bribes is just not the way to plan in this country. We should plan appropriate development, protecting the beautiful places which are fast disappearing.’ He suggested ministers should focus on building flats in towns rather than developing a ‘a few homes in meadows’. The two men clashed over the need to build more homes on greenfield sites as ministers warned grandparents not to oppose housebuilding for their children and grandchildren . Mr Boles hit back: ‘I have two homes - one I own with a huge mortgage, and one the taxpayer thankfully rents for me in my constituency. Simon, I know, has at least two homes because I have been to two of them. ‘Those of us who have two homes or more need to be very careful about telling people to go and live in a top floor flat when they are trying to bring up two kids and want a house with a garden.’ Mr Boles, whose father Sir Jack Boles is a former director-general of the National Trust, defended his comments yesterday, saying Sir Simon was ‘profoundly wrong’ about the need for new housing on green field sites. He declined to say which side of the argument his father was on, saying; ‘He’s entitled to his own opinions.’ He declined to say which side of the argument his father was on, saying; ‘He’s entitled to his own opinions.’ The row cam ahead of a major speech by Mr Boles today when he dramatically raised . the stakes over the housing crisis, saying the Government has a ‘moral’ duty to force councils to find land for development to defend Margaret . Thatcher’s dream of a ‘property owning democracy’. And he has warned grandparents who oppose new housebuilding risk 'propping up their kids and their grandkids' who cannot afford to buy their home own. He has unveiled plans to bribe local communities with hundreds of thousands of pounds in cash to accept new house building. In . future, neighbourhood groups who back plans for estates will be handed . money to build community centres, save a pub or re-roof the local . church. Mr Boles will also deliver a threat to town hall chiefs, warning those who refuse to find land to build on will be overruled. Ministers have given council bosses until March to come up with land to build 270,000 homes for each of the next five years.","Tory Nick Boles clashes with Sir Simon Jenkins over the need to build on greenfield sites .

It is used for billiard balls, piano keys, carved art and jewelry. The number of elephants killed by poacher has doubled in the last decade. Today, eight out of every ten elephant deaths is the result of poaching, compared with four out of ten deaths six years ago, the prosecutor's office said.

A British soldier has been killed and six others wounded by a member of the Afghan National Army. The attacker opened fire with an M16 semi-automatic rifle after a row broke out at the fortified Patrol Base Hazrat in Nahr-e Saraj, Helmand Province. The killer, named locally as Mohammad Qasim Faroq, was said to have often led prayers. He attacked his Afghan colleagues before turning the weapon on British forces, and was shot dead at the scene.

"By . Leon Watson . A mountain of binbags has built up in a block of flats after council binmen made  just one rubbish collection in eight weeks because of an EU law. Residents in a block of flats in Colchester, Essex, were told red tape means the binmen can't collect rubbish there when it's too dark for them to see it. As a result, the massive pile of 70 stinking black binbags has built up and is now overspilling the bin store with rats spotted sniffing around the pile. Overflowing: Flats resident Jill Bowyer with the rubbish bin men refused to collect piled up in the bin area . Furious residents stepped in to demand the binmen take away the black bags. But they were stunned when the binmen told them that the EU regulations mean they can't put their hands where they can't see them for health and safety reasons. The binmen have now refused to collect any more rubbish from the flats, saying they can't be seen to be breaking the rules. Many of the bags now spilling out of the store are split and rats have already been spotted in the area just yards from people's front doors. Too dark: The heaps of rubbish at the flats in Colchester, Essex . The block of flats in Colchester where a massive pile of 70 stinking black bin bags has built up and is now overspilling the bin store . Health and safety rules have left residents of the block of flats in Colchester with eight weeks of rubbish . Block resident Jill Mawby said: 'We . thought the binmen had forget to come into the flats so we waited . around to have a word with them. 'But . when we spoke to them about it, they said if they cannot see where they . are putting their hands, then they can't pick up the bags because of EU . law. 'There were 12 binmen, yet they could not collect our rubbish. It's utter madness.' Residents from the block of flats use the communal store for their bins which should be picked up on a weekly basis by workers from Colchester Borough Council. Miss Mawby, a mother of two, added: 'All we can smell is weeks' worth of bins - it really is disgusting. 'Colchester Council promised me a collection would be made yet I just don't think it is going to happen.' A spokesman for Colchester Borough Council said: 'The crews have identified an issue with the accessibility of collection in a bin store at this location which is now to be investigated. 'We will ensure that all the rubbish at this location is removed as part of this visit and liaise with the property management company to ensure that any future problems are prevented.","Massive pile of 70 bags has built up in block of flats in Colchester, Essex .

"By . Charles Sale . Follow @@charliesale . Brazil World Cup chiefs are jubilant at the end of the group stage as to how well the tournament has gone, on and off the pitch. But despite the triumphant attitude of sports minister Aldo Rebelo and Ricardo Trade, CEO of the organising committee, at the FIFA briefing, there are serious concerns within the IOC at Rio’s behind-schedule preparations for the 2016 Olympics. The fear is that rushing to complete a huge construction project — temporary and permanent — will lead to safety issues, with Brazil’s building and planning controls not nearly as rigorous as London 2012’s. A roaring success: Aldo Rebelo (right) celebrates alongside Prince Harry as Neymar scores for Brazil against Cameroon... but will the Olympics be such a success? Volunteers are also seen as a big problem, with worries inside the IOC over ensuring that the 70,000 temporary workforce turn up every day. Then there is the problem of traffic chaos in Rio that will be even worse when the obligatory Olympic lanes are installed. Rio has coped with the traffic issue during the World Cup by making every match day in the city a public holiday. But that cannot be done for 16 successive days of Olympic sport. The biggest panic is among international sport federations — many of whom are due to hold test events in Rio next year, with facilities nowhere near complete. A Rio 2016 spokesman said they are looking forward to giving a full update on progress to the IOC Coordination Commission on their next visit at the end of September. And they have promised to give a million Brazilians the opportunity to learn a second language. This will include all those who apply to be volunteers, whether or not they are accepted. Complaints: Phil Neville was slammed for his co-commentary debut . Phil Neville has been given no opportunity by the BBC to remedy his nightmare, monotone debut as co-commentator in the England v Italy match in Manaus, for which he was widely castigated and which saw the Beeb swamped with 445 complaints. Neville, who is going home tomorrow, is a studio pundit for the Brazil v Chile first-pick, last-16 game, with Martin Keown in the co-commentator role. The BBC would not commit to whether Neville would have remained as co-com if England had stayed in the tournament. Probably not. The fall-out from the Luis Suarez biting incident is set to run for the rest of the summer. The Uruguayan FA are not likely to receive any reduction in the Suarez sentence from the FIFA appeals committee. But the next step will be to go to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, who temporarily overturned Mohamed bin Hammam’s lifetime ban from football for lack of evidence. After that, there is the Swiss Federal Tribunal, who called FIFA’s banning of Brazilian midfielder Matuzalem following a breach-of-contract row with Shakhtar Donetsk ‘fundamentally unlawful.’ Sepp Blatter’s unilateral decision to spend £16million on his FIFA history film United Passions has not been reflected in box-office interest. It is understood only Portugal and Serbia have taken up Blatter’s vanity project, which FIFA say will get another airing at the Zurich film festival. Vanity Project: Sepp Blatter's film has not received universal popularity . Meanwhile, FIFA somehow deny that Blatter is purposely being kept away from appearing on the big screen during matches to avoid being booed. When asked why the cameras focused only on German Chancellor Angela Merkel when she was sitting next to Blatter during the Germany v Portugal match, FIFA secretary Jerome Valcke replied: ‘Maybe the guy on the camera had a preference for Angela Merkel.’ Cruise control: Shane Warne was on a boat around Greece as England lost to Sri Lanka . Shane Warne, the rent-a-quote former Aussie cricketer, has laid into Alastair Cook over his woeful captaincy during England’s defeat by  Sri Lanka at Headingley. But it emerges that Sky Sports pundit Warne wasn’t at the game at any stage — and was instead on holiday on a boat around Greece for most of the match. It is also claimed that bon viveur Warne needed to set an alarm to wake him up to do his commentary stints at Lord’s during the first Test against Sri Lanka. Sky claim Warne had not been partying too hard, is always highly professional and, if he had set an alarm, it would be to remind himself about his commentary slots.","There are serious concerns within the IOC at Rio’s behind-schedule preparations for the 2016 Olympics .

"By . Chris Pleasance . A man born with no arms of legs has fulfilled his dream of being a pro fisherman and now competes in one of the world’s top tours. Clay Dyer, 36, has caught more than 7,000 fish weighing up to 44lb during the Bassmaster Open Series, a bass fishing tour across America. Grasping the rod between his neck and shoulder to cast, he then uses his partial right arm to operate the reel, snapping the rod with his neck and shoulder to haul the fish into the boat. Scroll down for video . Clay Dyer, 36, competes in fishing tours around America despite being born without arms or legs . Clay holds the rod between his neck and shoulder to cast, controls the reel with his partial right arm, and snaps the rod with his shoulder to flick the fish into his boat . He even refuses to use a specially adapted rod because he believes they give him an unfair advantage over the other competitors. The unique method has never hindered his chances of bagging a prize catch, winning up to £5,650 ($9,500) in competitions.The largest fish he ever caught was a 44lb mackerel. Clay, from Fayetteville in Tennessee, USA, caught his first fish when he was eight. Clay refuses to use a specially adapted rod, because he believes it would give him an unfair advantage . Clay started fishing with his family and caught his first fish aged eight. The largest he has ever landed was a mackerel weighing 44lb . He said: 'I’ve been competitive my whole life - I was a three-sport athlete in school. 'I played baseball, American football and basketball. I used my right shoulder and right jaw to hold/swing the bat in baseball. 'I used my right arm and right side of my face to aim and throw and hold the basketball and football. 'But I chose fishing because it gave me the best opportunity to get to the top. 'There are modified rods and reels I could use but I’ve never looked into them. Other anglers don’t use anything special - I want it to be an even playing field.' Growing up Clay was surrounded by fishing-mad family who would take him with them. His unorthodox technique has never stopped Clay from landing a winning catch, and he has previously scooped $9,500 (£5,650) in prize money . Clay says he tried different kinds of fishing before settling on bass fishing because it is the most lucrative . He added: 'My family was always fishing - I caught my first fish in my grandparents pond. 'I loved all kinds of fishing from catfishing to browns but bass fishing is a lot more lucrative so that’s why I chose it. 'The competitive fishing circuit is like a great big family. We all compete but at the end of the day we all respect each other.'

"By . James Slack . Brussels is demanding that 26 police forces across the EU should have access to the personal details of every motorist in Britain. So far Home Secretary Theresa May is yet to implement the diktat . Brussels is demanding that 26 police forces across the EU should have access to the personal details of every motorist in Britain. The Government is being threatened with fines totalling millions of pounds unless it obeys the ‘Orwellian’ edict. Foreign police also want open access to the UK’s national DNA database and fingerprint records so they can check them against crime scenes and camera footage. MPs and civil liberties groups fear identity mistakes will lead to Britons being accused of crimes they have not committed. But there is particular alarm at the idea of overseas police having access to information about every registered driver in the UK. The Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency database contains details of 38million drivers. If foreign police give the British authorities a single wrong digit from a number plate – or if criminals have cloned a UK registration – then the officers would be given names, addresses, purchase details and a wealth of other personal information on the wrong suspect. Motorists could then face a lengthy ordeal to prove their innocence. There are fears that, once a foreign force has the DVLA data, it could fall into the wrong hands or be ‘lost’. Concerns have also been raised about checks against Britain’s DNA database, which is the largest in the world. Some EU countries have worryingly high error rates when it comes to checking DNA samples. European rules allow police to conduct tests of a lower quality than are permitted in Britain. Academics in the Netherlands, which has been running the scheme for four years, found that two-thirds of ‘matches’ at the lowest level wrongly identified an innocent person as a genetic match. The nightmare scenario could see a Briton placed under a European Arrest Warrant and bundled off to another country before they can prove mistaken identity. Labour quietly signed Britain up to the regime, known as the Prum Treaty, in 2008, and it was supposed to come into force at least two years ago. Foreign police also want open access to the UK's national DNA database and fingerprint records so they can check them against crime scenes and camera footage . But Home Secretary Theresa May – concerned about civil liberties and handing too much power to Brussels – is yet to implement the diktat. According to European Commission papers seen by the Mail, this has angered the Eurocrats, who are now threatening to issue Britain with ‘infringement proceedings’ if it does not obey by the end of 2014. The ultimate sanction is a fine issued by the European Court of Justice. The minimum is £7.5million for each ruling against the UK. The Commission report admits: ‘A considerable number of member states consider that the matching rules, in particular for DNA data, are not fully satisfactory and should be designed in a better way so as to avoid matches that are identified as false upon subsequent verification.’ But it then goes on to say there should be no excuse for Britain and a small number of other member states who are resisting implementing the regime. Last night Tory MP Dominic Raab, who unearthed the Commission’s report, called the scheme ‘Orwellian’. He said: ‘It beggars belief that in the same report that acknowledges the vulnerability of the regime to mistakes and serious risks of overloading national systems, the Commission is threatening to fine Britain and other member states for not doing its bidding. This reckless scheme is a disaster waiting to happen. ‘The risks of data-sharing on such a massive scale have not been addressed, especially given the potential for innocent people to be caught up in the investigations of foreign authorities, and the risk of criminals gaining fraudulent access to such information.’ Supporters of the treaty argue that it will help to fight cross-border crime. They say British police will get access to information on foreign suspects living in the UK. Innocent Britons may suffer because of errors by foreign police .","Foreign police also want open access to the UK’s national DNA database .

"By . Dan Bloom . Founder: Prince Charles is 'well aware' of up to 100 potential job losses at The Prince's Trust . Prince Charles' charity for deprived youngsters is axing up to 100 jobs to save on administration costs. The move comes after The Prince's Trust suffered a £2.8million funding shortfall last year which forced it to dig into its reserves. Chief executive Martina Milburn said the Prince of Wales, who founded the charity in 1976 and is still its president, was 'well aware' of the proposed cuts and had backed them to focus on the front line. All 1,300 of the charity's staff are being consulted on the redundancies, which are mostly expected to happen at the charity’s London headquarters. Ms Milburn told BBC Radio 4's The World At One: 'Our head office has become a little too complicated and a bit too top heavy so we are basically slimming down head office and protecting our frontline delivery in order to get ourselves back to sort of break-even budget. 'We are looking at how, as a charity, our admin costs are as low as possible and our money going directly to young people is as much as possible. 'We are currently undergoing a period of consultation but we think it will be between 50 and 100 jobs so we will be going down from 1,300 to about 1,200.' Ms Milburn said the heir to the throne was 'very well aware' of the use of reserve funds and of the move to slim down the staff. 'We felt it was very important to invest in young people in the recession,' she said. 'We have the reserves in the bank to do that and the trustees took the view, along with the executive, that reserves are there for a rainy day and that for young people all around the United Kingdom it was certainly raining. 'The Prince understands basic finances and how you need to make sure that you spend as small amount as you can on administration when you are a charity.' A spokesman said the staff cuts may affect one 'small' element of the trust’s work with young people, but she could not confirm what that element would be because the plans are still out to consultation. However, she said: 'We expect the number of young people we help to remain broadly the same.' President: Prince Charles on a visit to a Prince's Trust centre in Dundee last year. It helps thousands of youths . The trust still has £22 million in reserves and is not in debt, she added. The Prince's Trust was founded to help 13 to 30-year-olds who are unemployed or have dropped out of school. It now has centres throughout Britain which offer enterprise courses, team challenges for people lacking social skills and cash grants of up to £500. The charity has more than 6,000 volunteers and helped a record 55,801 young people in 2012/13, up almost 2,000 on the year before and almost 10,000 on 2010/11. In that time its income rocketed from £40million to £58million - but so did its spending. The charity, whose top executive is paid almost £150,000, spent £80,000 more than it earned in 2012-13. The amount of ready cash it held also dropped by more than £2million in a year.","All of 38-year-old charity's 1,300 staff are being consulted on redundancies .

"By . Emma Reynolds . This is the shocking moment a furious mixed-race teenager tried to hit a woman on the Tube after she made a racist remark. The mobile phone footage posted on YouTube yesterday is entitled 'Racist Woman On London Train Gets What She Deserves!' It begins a short way into their argument - after the 19-year-old aspiring recording artist had apparently stepped on the woman's shoe. Scroll down for videos . Violence: The female passengers, left, makes racist comments until the boy is so angry he lunges at her . Furious reaction: The 19-year-old is dragged away from the woman and told to 'relax' by fellow passengers, while the driver asks what is going on over the intercom . Race row: The pair trade insults in the run-up to the violence, with her calling him a 'smelly Nigerian' and him calling her a 'white princess' The pair trade insults, with the boy shouting that the woman has been racist, and her then calling him a 'smelly Nigerian', before he compares her to an 'escort'. Their . expletive-littered argument then descends into violence, with the . teenager lunging at the woman after accusing her of having hit him with a . bottle. Eventually, the Tube . driver asks what is happening over the intercom, and the three-minute . video comes to an end as the fight is broken up.

He later added: 'Calling me a smelly african... Then having the audacity is hit me with a bottle.' And yesterday he posted: 'Remember Racism is Disgusting and Totally Unacceptable'. He later deleted the tweets. British Transport Police believe the video was filmed on Tuesday and posted online the next day. War of words: She accuses him of stepping on her toe and he asks if she thinks she is in America, before she apparently hits him with a bottle as the row escalates . A BTP spokesman said: 'There is an . allegation of abusive behaviour by the woman towards the man, but that . doesn’t justify a violent response. 'The . man and woman pictured in the images are seen arguing with each other . on the video and we’re keen to speak to both of them to get their . version of events. 'We urge them or anyone who knows . them, as well as passengers who were on the train at the time, to come . forward so we can begin to build a full picture of what exactly took . place.' They are appealing for information . about the incident, believed to have taken place on a southbound . Northern line service between Old Street and Moorgate. The footage begins with the woman, who appears to be in her 20s, saying: 'I . wouldn't f***ing touch you. You are f***ing s*** on my shoe' and adding . that her boyfriend is black, suggesting that this shows she was not . being racist. 'He respects me,' she continues, after the boy had apparently insulted her appearance. The teenager replies: 'OK white princess, queen, Kate Middleton!' Tempers flare: The boy is seen apparently throwing punches, while other passengers look on in horror . He criticises her 'lunatic antics' and calls her a 'smelly p**** b****', adding: 'How old are you, 28? I'm only 19.' She expresses concern that 'b******s like you will steal from me' and calls him a 'smelly f***ing Nigerian.'

"By . Peter Allen In Paris . Nicolas Sarkozy was plunged into yet another corruption scandal today following allegations that he tried to interfere in an arms sales enquiry while president of France. The 57-year-old is said to have violated a confidentiality law when dealing with the so-called 'Karachi Affair'. It involves a 2002 terrorist bombing in the Pakistani city that killed 11 French engineers - allegedly because kickbacks over submarine sales by France to Pakistan had not been paid. Probe: Nicolas Sarkozy is to be investigated over allegations that he tried to interfere in an arms sales enquiry while president of France . Money linked to the arms deals is said to have been used to help fund the 1995 presidential election campaign of former French prime minister Édouard Balladur - a campaign for which Mr Sarkozy was spokesman. In September 2011, the then President Sarkozy issued a statement saying that he was not being investigated in relation to the Karachi Affair. Money linked to the arms deals is said to have been used to help fund the . 1995 presidential election campaign of former French prime minister . Édouard Balladur (pictured) The engineers' families sued Mr Sarkozy over the press release, saying it violated laws that prohibit the publication of information about on-going investigations. Mr Sarkozy enjoyed presidential immunity from prosecution at the time, but three judges have now ruled that he should be investigated for allegedly interfering in the Karachi probe. 'The act of permitting the release of information concerning on-going investigations does not enter into the functions of the president,' the three judges said in their own official ruling. Two former close aides to Sarkozy have already been charged by judges investigating the alleged Karachi kickbacks. Mr Sarkozy allegedly authorised the creation of a shell company used to channel kickbacks to Mr Balladur. It is the latest legal headache for Mr Sarkozy, who has already been made an assisted witness in the so-called Bettencourt Affair - in which he is accused of accepting illegal cash from France's richest women to fund his 2007 election as president. Mr Sarkozy is said to have accepted brown envelopes full of cash from Liliane Bettencourt, the l'Oreal heiress. The home Sarkozy shares with his third wife, supermodel Carla Bruni, was raided by anti-corruption police within weeks of him losing the presidency to Socialist Francois Hollande in May.

"By . Steve Robson . and Chris Greenwood . A high-rolling poker player dubbed ‘The Don’ was jailed for seven years yesterday for duping two banks in a £750million fraud during the property boom. Flamboyant fraudster Achilleas Kallakis, 44, conned lenders into advancing enormous loans to buy 16 landmark properties across the UK. The nephew of a Greek shipping magnate teamed up with ‘prolific forger’ Alexander Williams, also 44, to swindle the Allied Irish Bank and the Bank of Scotland. From 2003 to 2008 the pair used forged documents, sham legal letters and bogus guarantees to mislead the banks, which eventually lost £60million when the scam collapsed. Jailed: Fraudsters Achilleas Kallakis, left, and Alex Williams, right, were sentenced to seven years and five years in prison respectively at Southwark Crown Court after being found guilty of a £750million mortgage con . Among the buildings was Lunar House, . the Home Office’s asylum processing centre in Croydon, bought for . £100million, the headquarters of the Daily Telegraph in Central London . for £225million, and a 23-storey building in Vauxhall, South London, for . £75million. Jailing the pair at Southwark Crown . Court, Judge Andrew Goymer said it ‘beggars belief’ senior bank managers . ignored warnings from lawyers over the men. He said the two institutions ‘acted carelessly and imprudently’. The pair’s fake guarantees led to . increased valuations and generated a £77million surplus, while a further . £114million was put up by AIB. They also duped the Bank of Scotland into parting with £26million in 2007 for the conversion of a ferry into a luxury yacht. Kallakis, of Chelsea, was jailed for seven years and Williams, of Fulham, for five. They were found guilty of 21 charges including conspiracy to defraud, forgery and money laundering. Kallakis, a father of four, claimed to be a San Marino ambassador. As a poker player in the US, he once won a million dollars in a game. He also owned property in Greece and Monaco. The pair were convicted in the 1990s . of selling bogus peerage titles to wealthy Americans. Williams was also . convicted in 1993 of using the names of dead people to obtain British . passports. Jailing Kallakis for seven years and Williams for five years, Judge Andrew Goymer said: 'Achilleas Kallakis I regard you as the prime mover in this fraud you had the experience of the property market and you also had the accumulated wealth. 'Alexander Williams you had a lesser role but by no means an insignificant one. 'You were involved in the production and control of the documents that allowed it.' Both men were disqualified from acting as company directors for six years. Achilleas Kallakis gave himself the nickname 'The Don' and enjoyed high-stakes poker games . Fraud: Achillieas Kallakis, far left, pictured on holiday in Borneo with with Prince Albert of Monaco, far right . Kallakis, the nephew of Greek shipping . magnate Pantelis 'Lou' Kollakis, said he wanted to turn property worth . £120m, between Piccadilly and Pall Mall in St James Square, into the . world's most expensive penthouse. Father-of-four . Kallakis, who called himself 'his excellency' and claimed to be a San . Marino ambassador, bought a private jet for £27m, a helicopter for . £5.2m, a luxury yacht moored in Monaco harbour and a collection of high . value art works. He owned a fleet of chauffer driven Bentleys, a villa in Mykonos and property in Brompton Square, Chelsea, and Monaco, where he is said to have been a member of Prince Albert's charitable foundation. Kallakis . and Williams used forged documents including bogus guarantees from Hong . Kong based property developer SHKP and sham letters attesting to their . wealth to rip off the banks. The Home Office building, Lunar House, in Croydon, south London, was one of the commercial properties Kallakis bought through fraudulent bank loans . The . fake guarantees, said to cover the rental income from the buildings, . led to increased valuations and generated a £77m surplus. A . further £114m put up by AIB and due to be paid in in reverse premiums - . incentives for SHKP - was also plundered by Kallakis and Williams. When the scam collapsed the banks lost a total of nearly £60m. Following a retrial lasting almost four months both men were found guilty of two charges of conspiracy to defraud. Kallakis and Williams were convicted in 1995 of selling bogus titles to wealthy Americans including current US congressman for the Louisiana 7th District, Charles Boustany. Their victims were attracted by the ultimate step in upward mobility and believed they would receive priority on the Queen's social list. Police then tracked the pair, who travelled by Concorde, through their BA Airmiles. They were fined and sentenced to 160 hours of community service. Both Kallakis and Williams changed their names after the peerage fraud - Kallakis was formerly known as Stefanos Kollakis, while Alexander was previously called Martin Lewis. Williams had also been convicted in February 1993 of using the names of dead people to obtain British passports. Prosecutor Victor Temple QC said the two men - with Swiss lawyer Michael Becker, who was not before the court, targeted AIB and the Bank of Scotland in a 'large scale financial fraud'. He said they had persuaded AIB by 'dishonest means, which included the production of forged documents' to advance monies in respect of the purchase the 16 properties between 2003 and 2008'. 'In all cases the money, some £740m in total, was advanced by AIB to companies directly or indirectly under the defendants' control,' he said. 'The ultimate loss to AIB was in excess of £56m.' The Telegraph Media Group headquarters on Buckingham Palace Road was bought for a reported £225million by Kallakis . Kallakis and Williams duped the Bank of Scotland into parting with millions in 2007 for the proposed conversion of an ex-passenger ferry into a luxury yacht. 'Dishonest means, again involving forged documentation, were used by the three to secure a loan in the sum of £26m,' said Mr Temple. 'The ultimate loss to the bank was approximately £5.8m.' 'The two men used forged deeds of guarantee they claimed had been signed by the bosses of Sun Hung Kai Properties coupled with forged board minutes to convince AIB to loan the money. They also provided sham accounts for a company called Oregon Finance Corporation which 'purported to show profit on a massive scale'. Mr Temple said: 'Oregon was worthless, built on straw.' They . used a similar deception to trick Bank of Scotland, providing a . worthless guarantee from Oregon, based on forged account sheets and a . death certificate of Kallakis's mother in which her surname had been . altered to hide Kallakis's name change. Kallakis . had been the 'frontman' in negotiations with the Bank of Scotland and . used his 'forceful' personality to steamroller the bank into paying out . the loan. He said: . 'Kallakis knew very well that just like AIB the Bank of Scotland were . keen to do a deal and, in particular, he knew very well that just as AIB . wanted to develop their property book so to the Bank of Scotland wished . to develop their marine book.' Judge Andrew Goymer jailed Achilleas Kallakis for seven years at Southwark Crown Court today describing him as 'the primer mover' in the fraud . Kallakis claimed he had run a 'genuine business' and had never misled the banks. He blasted AIB, branding the bank 'greedy rats' and claiming its forced sale of his property portfolio to Stephen Vernon's Green Property group a ploy to steal his assets. He said: 'They manipulated the situation and they took the assets knowing they were going to not pay us what we were rightfully due.' George Carter-Stephenson QC, defending Kallakis, said: 'One has to wonder whether there was ever an intended loss, i.e. whether the defendants ever thought there would be a loss to the bank, given that these transactions were taking place during the course of what may be described as a major property boom when nobody saw an end to it and the events of 2008 took many bankers as well as ordinary people by surprise.' Kallakis, of Brompton Square, Chelsea, and Williams of Epirus Road, Fulham, both south west London, were convicted of two counts of conspiracy to defraud. The jury were discharged from returning verdicts on 19 further counts including forgery, fraud, money laundering and obtaining a money transfer by deception. After the case, Serious Fraud Office case manager Ronan Duff said: 'This was an audacious, persistent fraud that enabled these defendants, Mr Kallakis in particular, to lead the lifestyle of the super-rich. 'The SFO have been equally persistent in investigating this elaborate scam and in ensuring that justice has been delivered'. Both will now face confiscation proceedings to try and recover some of the money lost.","Achilleas Kallakis, 44, fooled bankers into giving him loans to buy a string of London properties including a Home Office building in Croydon .

More than 45,000 rank and file police officers have demanded the right to go on strike. In a ballot, one in three members of the Police Federation voted to claim the same industrial rights as other public sector workers. Currently, police officers are banned by law from taking industrial action. But some – furious at Home Office cuts to pay, pensions and overtime – want to be able to walk out in the same way as teachers, nurses and Tube workers. Of those who voted, 80 per cent were in favour of the Federation campaigning for striking rights. Around 56,333 voted, of whom 45,651 voted in favour.  Some 10,681 were opposed. But because fewer than half the Federation’s 130,000 members took part in the vote, it is not binding on the staff association’s leaders. This has led to further controversy. Members of the Metropolitan branch, representing officers in London, said it was ‘appalled’ by the 50 per cent rule. They claimed this meant a clear mandate from members was ‘simply being ignored’. A spokesman said: ‘The Police Federation of England and Wales decided to impose an unachievable threshold of 50 per cent plus one of the entire membership to achieve a result. PFEW has no rules that  justify this decision. Lost: A ballot of police officers held on the right to take industrial action has failed to reach a high enough majority, even though thousands voted in favour . ‘In effect, it ruled that officers who . chose to abstain would be deemed to have voted “no”.’ The Federation . represents more than 130,000 officers from the rank of constable to . chief inspector. Pleased: Home Office minister Damian Green welcomed news that the Police Federation failed in its attempt to overturn a ban on strikes . Officers are banned from forming trade unions and taking strike action under the Police Act 1919. The Federation has loudly opposed cuts . to police funding of around one fifth, and members marched on Whitehall . to show their fury at changes to police pay and perks. Steve Williams, chairman of the PFEW, . said: ‘Our members value their unique employment status as servants of . the Crown and I believe the vast majority of them would view industrial . action as a last resort.’ Police Minister Damian Green said: ‘I . am pleased the vast majority of police officers do not want the  right . to strike. Their work is too important.’ Earlier this year the Home Office . announced starting salaries for officers with no experience would be cut . by nearly a fifth to  £19,000 a year – less than a trainee manager at . McDonald’s. Home Secretary Theresa May is yet to . decide whether to accept a recommendation from Tom Winsor – the former . rail regulator commissioned by the Government to  examine police pay and . conditions – to allow chiefs to sack under- performing officers.","Police Federation needed half their 133,000 members to turnout for vote .

"By . Stuart Woledge . We've all heard the nursery rhyme hickory dickory dock and the cheeky mouse who ran up the clock. But few will have heard the lesser-known tale of the Ford Focus, an RAC mechanic and a rat - until now. Martin Payn, 32, was given a surprise when he opened the bonnet of the car to find a brown and white rodent starring back at him. Rats! This furry fellow caused havoc when it sneaked into a car engine and bit through wiring . Can't catch me: Martin Payn spent nearly an hour prodding and poking the engine to catch the rodent . He had been called out by the owner when the windscreen wipers on the vehicle stopped working. The rogue rodent had found its way into the engine and then proceeded to chew through the wiring. During a bizarre 45-minute escapade that would have been more suited to the environmental health department's pest control team, Mr Payn, from Yeovil in Somerset set about trying to coax the creature out. He even called upon the talents of a neighbour's cat, but the fickle feline showed little interest in catching her quarry. He said: ""I was just fixing the damaged wire when the customer screamed because he'd spotted a rat. 'It was easy to fix the breakdown, . but pretty difficult to catch the rat as I think it might have been . living on the road for a while. We called for the help of a cat but it wasn't interested. 'After a bit of prodding and poking with a rod I have for unlocking car doors, the rat came out of its hiding place. The customer then picked it up by its tail and let it go.' Seizing its chance, the rat took off and disappeared under Mr Payn's van. Can't catch me: Martin Payn spent nearly an hour prodding and poking the engine to catch the rodent . He added: 'The joke at the scene was that he would now be travelling with me as we couldn't find it anywhere.' There is many a true word spoken in jest, or so the saying goes, and the story did not end there. Four days later Mr Payn received a call from wife Charlotte, 25, to tell him their Staffordshire Bull . Terrier Ollie had snared a rat a bearing similar markings to the one he had fished from underneath his customer's bonnet. But, in a tragic twist, Ollie showed considerably more interest in the furry fellow, and duly dispatched him without a second thought. Mr Payn said: 'Little did I know that was what must . have happened because four days later my wife rang me at work to say . our dog had just caught a rat in the garden. 'When I got home I knew it was the . same one. I could tell because it had distinctive markings and looked . like a house rat rather than a wild one. 'This is definitely the strangest breakdown I've been too. 'I've seen evidence of rodent damage . in cars before, but I've never come face to face with a rat before, and I . hope it's a while before I do again.'","RAC mechanic's surprise at 'strangest breakdown' he has ever been to .

"By . Peter Allen . Witness: British cyclist Brett Martin has told police he passed a motorbike driving away from the scene a few minutes before he arrived at the layby . A mystery motorcyclist seen around the Alpine beauty spot where four people were blasted to death is now the prime suspect for the murders, it emerged today. The breakthrough in the baffling case came thanks to Brett Martin, a British cyclist who discovered the bodies close to Lake Annecy, in eastern France. The 53-year-old ex RAF serviceman has told French police that he passed a motorbike driving away from the isolated lay-by where the slaughter took place on September 5th last year. Between three and five minutes later he discovered a BMW containing the bodies of Surrey engineer Saad al-Hilli, 50, his wife Iqbal, 47, and her mother Suhaila al-Allaf, 74. Lying next to the car was the murdered French cyclist Sylvain Mollier, 45, while the al-Hilli’s daughter, seven-year-old Zainab, was stumbling around outside having been shot in the shoulder and pistol whipped. French police today confirmed that - despite numerous appeals - neither the motorcycle nor its rider has been traced. 'It passed me three, four or five minutes’ before Mr Martin arrived, the Englishman told detectives during a number of meetings. Mr . Martin said the rider was wearing a full-face helmet, possibly white, . and black clothing, and that the motorbike’s engine may have been white . with a top case on the back. The . description is similar to that of a motorbike seen around the time of . the murders on a stretch of private road at Col de Cherel, four miles . further up the mountain. A dairy farmer recalled seeing a white motorcycle with a top case and possibly with saddlebags. 'The farmer thought he [the motorcyclist] was acting suspiciously and looked lost as he stopped to check his route,’ a police source told the Sunday Times. Baffling: Police are still trying the solve the murder of Saad al-Hilli and his family in the French Alps . The source confirmed that the motorcyclist seen by Mr Martin was the 'prime suspect’ for the killings. Neither the farmer nor Martin could identify the make or model of the motorbike, nor provide further details about its rider. Murdered: Saad al-Hilli, was found dead alongside three others, including his wife and mother . Eric Maillaud, the prosecutor in the case, confirmed his appeal to the motorcyclist to 'make himself known as soon as possible’. Mr Martin had been riding his mountain bike up a steep road above the French village of Chevaline when he arrived at Le Martinet car park at about 3.30pm. As he turned the corner, he saw the small, frail figure of Zainab collapse face down in front of him and wrongly thought she was 'pranking around'. He put Zainab in the recovery position - a move which may well have saved her life - and then switched the BMW’s engine off. Mr Martin did not spot the Al-Hilli’s second daughter, four year old Zeena, who had escaped the killer by hiding under her mother’s clothing and was not found by French police until around eight hours later. Unable to get a phone signal, Martin began to cycle back down the road and met a car carrying three hitchhikers who alerted the authorities. As a routine part of their inquiry, police examined Mr Martin’s own background but found nothing to arouse suspicion. While the rider of the motorbike has been firmly established as the prime suspect, the motive for the massacre remains a mystery. Speculation has ranged from a feud within the al-Hilli family or a random shooting by a psychopath to the suggestion that Mollier was the intended target.

"By . Corey Charlton . The theft of an American flag from the family of a firefighter killed in September 11 is causing heartache as they desperately plead for its return. The flag stolen from the front of Melissa Brengel's Long Island property was flown over the World Trade Center during the recovery and cleanup and was later gifted to her from the September 11 Families Association. Her brother Jonathan Ielpi was a New York firefighter killed in the . terrorist attacks on the morning of September 11, 2001. Firefighter Jonathan Ielpi, left, was killed in the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center. His sister, Melissa Brengel is now pleading for the return of the flag that was given to her in his memory . NBC New York reported Mrs Brengel said the flag was still at the front of her property when she returned home about 10.30pm on Monday, but it had disappeared some time during the night. 'We put it out during certain times of the year just to remember,' she said. 'I don't think there's a way [the thief] could have known, but at the same time, they're coming onto my property and taking something that means so much to me and so many Americans.' Jonathan Ielpi, 29, phoned his father Lee on the day of the attack to tell him he was en route to the site. He did not make it out of the south tower. His father is also a firefighter and is a co-founder of Tribute WTC, which pays homage to the victims of the attack. It is not the first time the insensitive handling of her brother's passing and his memory has caused heartache. Last year Brengel was outraged after the cast member of a reality TV show was depicted in a photo shoot acting flippantly around her brother's memorial. She was watching the Bravo reality TV show ‘Princesses: Long Island’ when she saw one of the cast members began to act imprudently around the statue of the firefighter who was her brother. She later said she felt her blood boil: 'It may not be against the law to do it, but it is the most disrespectful and disgusting that I think you can do,' she said. She now hopes the flag thief will hear of its significance, have a change of heart and return it.","Family pleads for return of stolen flag that was a gift in memory of family member killed at the World Trade Center September 11 attack .

"By . Tamara Cohen . 'Deluded': David Jones MP faced a deluge of criticism for his views on gay parenting . Gay couples are incapable of bringing up children safely, a Cabinet minister claimed yesterday. Same-sex partnerships could not provide a ‘warm and safe environment’ to raise a family, said Welsh Secretary David Jones. The Tory MP, who voted against this month’s gay marriage Bill, added: ‘I regard marriage as an institution that has developed over many centuries, essentially for the provision of a warm and safe environment for the upbringing of children, which is clearly something that two same-sex partners can’t do. ‘Which is not to say that I’m in any sense opposed to stable and committed same-sex partnerships.’ The married father of two later insisted he was not homophobic and had gay people  in his life ‘who are important to me’. In a statement, Mr Jones said he was not opposed to gay couples adopting children and added: ‘I simply sought to point out that, since same-sex partners could not biologically procreate children, the institution of marriage was one that, in my opinion, should be reserved to opposite sex partners.’ His comments drew a storm of protests from politicians and gay rights groups. Andrew White, the director of Stonewall in Wales, called the remarks ‘offensive and inaccurate’.‘There are many different types of family in Wales today, including many same-sex couples raising children,’ he said. ‘It’s deeply undermining to families and children when they hear this sort of ill-informed comment.’ Labour’s Welsh spokesman Owen Smith said it showed the Tories were ‘out of touch’ with modern Britain. Scroll down for video . 'It's insulting and absurd to make a distinction like that': Angela Eagle MP branded David Jones 'deluded' A recent study showed that children brought up by gay couples suffered no disadvantage (stock image) ‘David Jones’s comments are profoundly . offensive and he should apologise immediately,’ he added. Downing Street . last night said David Cameron rejected Mr Jones’ claims. ‘The Prime . Minister believes gay families can provide a warm and loving home for . children and has campaigned for more children in care to be adopted, by . same sex couples and heterosexual couples,’ said a spokesman for No 10. Mr Jones was one of two Cabinet members and among the 136 Tory MPs who voted against the Equal Marriage Bill earlier this month. He claimed his Clwyd West constituents were opposed to same-sex weddings – and to civil partnerships being converted to marriages. 'We're saddened that the Secretary of State for Wales should make such an offensive and inaccurate remark' Environment Secretary Owen Paterson also . rejected the legislation, which was eventually voted through in the . House of Commons despite opposition by more than half of his party’s . backbenchers, who were allowed a free vote. In 2011, there were 8,000 same-sex families with dependent children in . the UK, of which 5,000 were in a civil partnership and 3,000 cohabiting, . according to official figures.

"By . Ryan Kisiel . and Rebecca Camber . and Wills Robinson . Dozens of people charged out of a West End nightclub after a man was shot dead in the early hours of Boxing Day. The 31-year-old was shot several times . at a private function at the Avalon nightclub in Shaftesbury Avenue, . Soho, at 3am. A bloodied shirt was found on the street outside the club on Boxing Day. Revellers - some with blood covering their clothes - fled to nearby Leicester Square after the shooting. Crime scene: A shirt covered in blood outside the Avalon club, which is in Shaftesbury Avenue, Soho . Cordoned off: Police closed Shaftesbury Avenue in London as they continued their investigation . The victim was rushed to hospital but died from multiple gunshot wounds. Scotland Yard detectives arrested a man on suspicion of murder and were last night continuing to question him. Yesterday broken glass covered the pavement and a bloodstained shirt lay outside the club, which is in the heart of London’s Theatreland. The venue is next door to the Queen’s Theatre – currently showing Les Miserables. It is also yards from the Apollo Theatre, which last week saw  audience members flee in terror after its ceiling collapsed during a live performance. One of the revellers said: ‘I was walking nearby when suddenly there was a loud crack of shots which was followed by screaming. ‘People . came pouring out of the door shouting and totally hysterical. Some had . blood on their clothes and I guessed they tried to help the man who had . been shot. Investigation: Officers search the pavement outside the venue in Soho, Central London . Probe: Forensic teams were carrying out a search of Avalon nightclub in Central London this morning . ‘Most ran away into Leicester Square through Chinatown.  Others mulled about shouting on their mobile phones saying someone had been shot and killed.’ Another witness, who was outside the nightclub, said: ‘The paramedics were trying to resuscitate the guy on the stretcher outside the club. He was covered in blood and looked naked. I think the guy was dead when they got him into the ambulance, he looked in a bad way. Armed police were standing outside the venue. It is unbelievable this could happen on Christmas night.’ Carla Protain was at the Christmas party, which was broken up early on Boxing Day. Yesterday she wrote on Twitter: ‘I don’t even know how to describe how I feel after last night. ‘It keeps playing on my mind. His family, how do they cope every Christmas from now on?’ She added: ‘I’m worried for my safety, I’d rather just not take the risk with certain raves now. Doesn’t feel worth it.’ Scene: A police officer stands guard at the entrance to the club after the shooting in the early hours of this morning . Venue: The shooting happened at Avalon nightclub in London's West End at around 3am . Investigation: Police closed the road in Central London after the incident in the early hours of the morning . Another club-goer posted: ‘Anyone could have got caught up in crossfire. Any one of us. They just had no regard. ‘I was a little teary earlier. So many thoughts of how differently that could have gone.’ And a local DJ who was working at the event tweeted: ‘RIP to the person who lost his life last night in front of me. I don’t know who you are but I wish God has taken you into his hands. ‘A stray bullet could have hit anyone and taken them! I can’t imagine his family right now.’ The Avalon is a nightclub, but also has a bar and a cocktail lounge in its basement. Their website describes the club as ‘a revitalised venue that oozes creativity and class’ which brings ‘a unique and stylish vibe to the heart of the West End’s party scene’. Yesterday Shaftesbury Avenue and a section of Wardour Street were still closed off as police and forensic officers investigated. A police spokesman said: ‘Police and London ambulance service attended to find a man suffering from multiple gunshot wounds. ‘He was taken to hospital but died from his injuries. We believe we know the identity of the deceased but await formal identification. Next of kin are aware.’","Man shot at several times at the private function at the Avalon nightclub .

"By . Sam Webb . Disappointment: The best-selling fantasy novelist Terry Pratchett has pulled out of a convention dedicated to his books because of poor health . Novelist Terry Pratchett has been forced to withdraw from an appearance at a convention celebrating his works because of health troubles. The top-selling author, 66, was due to meet his fans at the Ankh-Morpork Grand Exhibition - named for the city in his Discworld series of books - next month in Manchester. In 2011 Sir Terry announced his diagnosis with posterior cortical atrophy (PCA), a rare variant of Alzheimer’s disease primarily affecting vision. His struggle with the condition - which he has dubbed his 'Embuggerance' - has now forced him to cancel his Q&A session, the first time he has had to do so. In a statement on the event's website, he said: 'I have been putting off writing this announcement for quite some time and on good days thought I wouldn’t have to write it at all. 'However, it is with great reluctance that I have to tell you all that I will not be able to attend the upcoming Discworld Convention in Manchester. 'I am very sorry about this, but I have been dodging the effects of PCA and have been able to write for much longer than any of us ever thought possible, but now The Embuggerance is finally catching up with me, along with other age-related ailments.' He told fans he had been looking forward to meeting them and added: 'They say time marches on, and it does, even though I have been running very fast to keep one step ahead of it.' Pratchett, who has sold over 85million books worldwide in 37 languages, will be represented at the convention by one of his famous black hats and will also answer questions sent to him by attendees over e-mail in a video segment. The chairman of the convention, John Hicks, said: 'While it is not going to be the same without Sir Terry, we wish him all the best. Rob Wilkins, his business manager, will be bringing The Black Hat to the Convention to represent Terry in absentia and we will, of course, welcome it with all due honours. Imagination: Discworld, the setting of many of Sir Terry's books. The flat planet is held aloft by elephants, who in turn stand on the bag of a giant turtle that is swimming through space . 'We thought it would be a humorous way of saying thank you. We'll make sure the hat has a good time.' He added that the author has enjoyed mingling with the crowd in previous years and said: 'He loves walking around and chatting with fans.' Sir Terry became a patron of Alzheimer’s Research UK in 2008 and donated the charity £1m. Research shows there are hundreds of thousands of people in the UK living with dementia, and more than 40 per cent of the UK population know someone close with the disease.

I know people will have already made plans far in advance and some will be travelling a long way, but this is the first time ever that I have been unable to attend a UK convention and I really am very sorry. They say time marches on, and it does, even though I have been running very fast to keep one step ahead of it. I really was looking forward to seeing your smiley, happy faces. Have fun everyone. Yes, on this occasion, have lots of fun. Advocate: Terry Pratchett in front of brain imagery, taken from a programme he hosted about Alzheimer's . In recent years, author Sir Terry Pratchett, who was diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease in 2007, has become a vocal advocate of assisted dying being legalised and regulated in the UK - saying: 'I live in hope I can jump before I am pushed.' In 2011 he appeared in a documentary, Choosing To Die, which showed his journey to the Dignitas clinic in Switzerland to follow two British men who had decided to end their lives. One of them, Peter Smedley, a millionaire hotelier who had motor neurone disease, later invited Pratchett and the cameras back to record his last moments. This was the first time an actual suicide has been filmed and broadcast in the UK - and the distressing scenes provoked strong reactions. In the documentary, he said: 'I know the time will come when words will fail me. Then, I don’t want to go on living.' He added: 'My life, my death, my choice.'","The best-selling author was diagnosed with the condition in 2011 .

"By . Andrew Marr . Recovery: Andrew Marr said he is not pushing to reshoot the title sequence because it would be out of date by Christmas . Dominic Lawson made a characteristically reasonable suggestion in his column in Monday’s Mail: he thought the Andrew Marr Show on BBC1 would be improved, and more honest, if its title sequence showed me as I really am, limping with a stick and with my left arm dangling — rather than striding in confidently, as I used to do. He made the quite correct point that there is nothing wrong with being disabled, and that those who seek to hide disability do no favours to those who are disabled; perhaps suggesting there is something wrong or to be ashamed of. So why, then, am I not pressing for us to reshoot the titles of the show to reflect how I really am just at the moment? The real answer is that I am changing. Many people recovering from a stroke don’t like the word ‘disabled’ at all, on the grounds that it suggests a static condition from which one cannot recover. And the truth is I’m not disabled in the same way that somebody who has lost a leg, or is born with a disability, might be disabled. I’m more in the position of somebody involved in a bad accident, and recovering. Doing lots of physiotherapy means that I am seeing small improvements all the time. I don’t think I am ever going to be 100 per cent again, or run a marathon again; but I do very much hope that in a year’s time I will be walking far more fluently, and without a stick. I have already discarded a lot of the orthotic and electronic aids I used to need in order to walk at all. I’m getting tiny amounts of use back in my left hand and arm. It’s very slow, and there are times when I despair, but the general direction is still forward. Nothing is certain, and it’s possible that I remain stuck where I am for a long time to come. But just as a title sequence showing me as I was six months ago would not be accurate in portraying me as I am today, so I think a new title sequence shot now (and it is an expensive, time-consuming business) would be badly out of date by Christmas. It isn’t true, however, as Dominic suggests, that huge efforts go into hiding my condition on air. In my first few appearances back on the programme, I stood with my stick. I don’t need to, any more. It’s perfectly obvious to everyone that I have a semi-paralysed hand. The only thing I don’t do is make much of it all. But why should I? The show is not about me, but about our guests and what they have to say. I don’t want people focusing on changes I am going through: I want them to sit and listen to Ed Miliband, or the Prime Minister, or whoever we have on. It’s very much the same calculation when I’m filming documentaries. I’ve just finished making three films about the Scots and the English, seen through the stories of famous writers. Journey: The title sequence shows him riding through parts of London, including Westminster, on a moped . Mostly, in these films, you won’t see me visibly struggling or disabled because I want you to listen to what I’m saying. But where I am filmed walking, I am obviously using a stick and limping. It’s the difference between hiding something, and not emphasising it. In my ordinary life, meanwhile, I don’t try in any way to hide what’s happened to me. I talk about it, far more than I really want to, and I’m constantly photographed or filmed in the street, sometimes doing physiotherapy exercises, and sometimes doing things like riding the tricycle I’ve had to use to replace bicycling. People at the Stroke Association have told me that my very public stroke, and my decision to get back to work quickly, despite the difficulties, has been good in raising awareness — and, indeed, money. I’m very pleased. Focus Mr Marr, who suffered a stroke 18 months ago, says viewers will not see him struggling or disabled in new projects because: 'I want you to listen to what I am saying' Campaign: The broadcaster says he does not want to be made a 'poster boy'. Instead he believes it is important to work for better physiotherapy treatments for stroke sufferers outside of London . But there is no obligation on anybody, me included, to be a poster boy. What is, I think, important, is to work for better physiotherapy services for those hundreds of thousands of people who have also suffered from a stroke but don’t have the luck to live in Central London, where so much of the best rehabilitation is; and who don’t perhaps have the money to pay for it, as I do. I am merely one of a million people in Britain who are recovering from neurological damage. Some of us can’t speak or see and are in wheelchairs; others appear almost entirely undamaged. Most of us, however, face a long and hard struggle to improve. There is a tiny number of people who have so much determination and energy that they can effectively rehabilitate themselves. Focus: The presenter also says that his show is about the guests and not about him . Most of us aren’t like that — and I certainly am not. We need the help of patient, skilled and understanding physiotherapists and trainers. They cost money — money which the NHS doesn’t have. And yet without that help, few of us can get back to work at all. It’s a terrible waste of human lives, and an economic waste as well. All those people stuck at home, dependent on carers, who could be out there earning, paying taxes and contributing to the country. So I believe we need some kind of big reorganisation and financial rethink to help people in my condition help ourselves — a sort of ‘national rehabilitation service’. If you’re getting bored watching my title sequence, think about that instead!","The broadcaster says he does not want to film the title sequence again .

"By . Jack Doyle . Pressure: ‘Red’ Len McCluskey, told Labour leader Ed Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for union members on Monday . The union bankrolling Labour’s general election campaign wants a new Ministry of Labour to represent the interests of trade unionists if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street. Unite is in talks with the party about creating a powerful department headed by a secretary of state, whose role would be ‘batting for 30million working people’, a senior union figure has revealed. In secret recordings passed to the Daily Mail, Steve Turner said Unite would also press for the repeal of trade union laws including the rule that unions can only call strikes after holding a postal ballot. His remarks will heap further pressure on the Labour leader to distance himself from Unite. On Monday, its general secretary, ‘Red’ Len McCluskey, told Mr Miliband to ‘bring home the bacon’ for union members as Unite pledged to donate up to £12million to Labour’s election campaign on top of the £12million given to the party since 2010. But in return the union is drawing up a list of demands for an incoming Labour government – including higher taxes, spending increases, an end to ‘austerity’ and a ditching of all anti-union laws passed in the 1980s and 1990s. Mr Turner, Unite’s assistant general secretary, revealed that the union was also in talks with Labour about new powers for trade union representatives within private companies. Speaking at a fringe event at Unite’s policy conference in Liverpool, he said: ‘[There are] a whole host of trade union freedoms we’re looking to secure from an incoming Labour administration, whether that’s internal governance within the union, or of course the right to strike and the right to ballot our members outside of postal ballots. You need corporate governance and… a real say at work. ‘Corporate governance and a secretary of state for a Ministry of Labour. You’ve got to have someone at the table batting for 30million working people. And that’s a key fundamental element of any… new deal we want to secure within our party.’ Mr Turner said the spread of wealth in society was ‘obscene’. He said: ‘Oxfam put in a report… on global wealth inequality. There are 85 people who have a combined wealth on this planet equivalent to the poorest 50 per cent on this planet. 'I was accused of [wanting to] put them all on a London bus and wanting to kill them when I was talking in the House of Commons recently. 'Of course that wasn’t the objective, if I was going to do that I would use a train carriage. You can’t get enough people on a bus.’ Tory MP Henry Smith said: ‘Weak Ed Miliband is now so deep in the union barons’ pockets he can barely look out. ‘In return for millions more in cash, Labour’s union paymasters are now even buying future Cabinet ministers.’ A Labour Party spokesman said: ‘Unite’s job is to stand up for its members. The Labour Party’s job is to put forward the right policies for the country.’ Future: The new Ministry of Labour would be set up if Ed Miliband was to make it into Downing Street .","Want a new Ministry of Labour if Ed Miliband gets into Downing Street .

"By . Lizzie Edmonds . This is the moment a giraffe gives birth to her calf under the watchful eye of a concerned father. In remarkable pictures, the giraffe Eura can be seen giving birth to her newborn at the GaiaZOO in Kerkrade, Netherlands. She then rather touchingly tends to the calf as it lies looking startled on the floor of the enclosure. The birth, which took place on June 20, followed a 15-month pregnancy. Scroll down for video . Giraffe Eura gives birth to her calf at the GaiaZOO in Kerkrade, Netherlands, earlier this week under the watchful eye of its concerned father . The calf, pictured, would have dropped two metres during the birth. Giraffes are usually born feet first - breaking the foetal membranes before falling to the ground - severing the umbilical cord . As the giraffe is the tallest living animal on earth - the newborn would have fallen about 6ft 6ins (two metres) during the birth. Luckily, this calf looks to have survived its fall without any major incident - although it does appear to be a little shell shocked. The birth comes as another gave birth in front of a jubilant crowd at San Diego Zoo in California. Spectators waited for two and a half hours for the mother to deliver the creature - with one person even capturing the moment on their camera. Onlookers are said to have cheered when the calf finally arrived covered in slime moment before a sack of fluid followed. The giraffe - full name Giraffa camelopardalis - is an African even-toed mammal and is the tallest living creature on earth. The species name of the animal refers to its camel-like appearance and the patches of colour on its fur. The newborn's mum and dad look at their calf - who appears a little startled while sitting on the floor of the enclosure. The parents would have tended the calf before helping it to walk . A giraffe pregnancy usually lasts between 400 and 460 days. Usually, the mother only births one calf - althought twins have been recorded on rare occasion. The mother gives birth standing up - with the calf usually emerging head and front legs first. This means the calf breaks through the fetal membranes before falling to the ground and severing the umbilical cord. The mother will then usually tend to her calf before helping it stand. Most can run within a couple of hours. Newborns are usually about 5ft 10 in (1.8 metres) tall.","Giraffe gives birth after 15-month pregnancy at GaiaZoo, Netherlands .

"By . Luke Garratt . Bitcoin's value has fallen 22 per cent after its most important business Mt. Gox went offline after rumours that $375 million-worth has been stolen. The rumoured theft and subsequent shutdown has caused problems for the online currency's public and financial image, as it still struggles for legitimacy. Visitors to the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox site now see only a blank page, and the shutdown of the page follows the resignation of Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles from the board of the Bitcoin Foundation. Scroll down for video . Bitcoin has been majorly set back by the most recent theft and disappearance of Mt. Gox, known as the most important business in the Bitcoin economy . Furious: Bitcoin trader Kolin Burges, right, of London and American Aaron (only his first name was given) hold protest signs as they conduct a sit-in in front of the office tower housing Mt. Gox in Tokyo . Bitcoin trader Kolin Burgess said he had . picketed the Tokyo headquarters of Mt. Gox since Feb. 14 after flying in from London, having lost $320,000 that he has tied up with the company. Burgess said: 'I may have lost all of my . money...it hasn't shaken my trust in Bitcoin, but it has shaken my trust in Bitcoin exchanges.' A 'crisis strategy' report shared widely online that claims to be an . internal Mt. Gox document says more than 740,000 bitcoins are missing . from the exchange, around 6 per cent of all Bitcoins currently in existence. Protester Aaron holds a placard during a demonstration against Mt. Gox, in front of the building where the digital marketplace operator is housed, in Tokyo . The Mt. Gox exchange froze withdrawals this month after reports from traders of increased delays trying to withdraw funds, with some waiting three months before being told they couldn't withdraw anything. It says . the theft went unnoticed for several years and turned on disguised . withdrawals. The theft is equal to losses of $350 million at current bitcoin . prices, but in reality, such a figure is highly uncertain because of . Bitcoin's extreme fluctuations in value and its lack of acceptance . as a currency. Bitcoin is a piece of data confined to an internet network by an algorithm. Once . released it can be traded and used like money online and can be . purchased with real cash. Many websites are now taking Bitcoins as a . form of currency. As well as digital currency, Bitcoin miners enjoy the competitive nature of unlocking the coins. It . has been dismissed by some as a Ponzi Scheme and touted by others as . the future of money. It is not centrally controlled and it's unique and . complex set up means the market cannot be altered or hacked, according . to the developers. There . are 21 million coins predicted to last until 2140 and their finite . nature means they perform more like a commodity, such as gold. The coins first emerged in 2008 and launched as a network in 2009. Users . choose a virtual wallet from one of the various providers which enables . them to receive, give and trade coins from other users. Bitcoins can be bought from specialist currency exchanges and online marketplaces . Financial speculators are saying the problems with Mt. Gox are hindering Bitcoin, which was . started in 2009 as a currency free from government controls. Meanwhile, supporters of the virtual currency have said its cryptography makes it . immune to theft or counterfeiting. Because of Mt. Gox's recent disappearance, Bitcoin currency's value has fallen from $550 to $418 in the past few hours. The six major Bitcoin exchanges and related organizations have released a joint statement that said they are working to 're-establish the trust squandered' by the failings of Mt. Gox. They said funds under their control are held securely, and Mt. Gox should not be considered a reflection of the value of Bitcoin or the digital currency industry. The joint statement insisted that Mt. Gox doesn't reflect the practices of the digital currency industry or the denigrate the value of Bitcoin itself. The statement said: 'This tragic violation of the trust of users of Mt. Gox was the result of one company's actions. 'As with any new industry, there are certain bad actors that need to be weeded out, and that is what we are seeing. 'Mt. Gox has confirmed its issues in private discussions with other members of the Bitcoin community. 'There are hundreds of trustworthy and responsible companies involved in Bitcoin. 'These . companies will continue to build the future of money by making Bitcoin . more secure and easy to use for consumers and merchants.' Crash: The value of the online currency has fallen fast in the time since Mt. Gox disappeared from the internet, sparking fears among Bitcoin investors and enthusiasts. Bitcoin is an attempt to create a currency that is free of government influence, and it is one the public have been slow to accept . Mt. Gox was founded in 2009 as a trading card exchange website by Jed McCaleb, specifically for the use of buying and selling Magic: The Gathering trading cards. In 2010 it changed to a Bitcoin exchange, and when Bitcoin started to dramatically rise in value in 2011, McCaleb sold the business to the now former Bitcoin Foundation board member Mark Karpeles, who became the CEO. Following Karpeles takeover, the company became one of the biggest Bitcoin exchanges in the world, managing over 70 per cent of Bitcoin exchanges by April 2013. Mt. Gox proceeded to have several troubles over the years, with examples including: . Despite there being no trace of Mt. Gox at their Tokyo offices, their name is still listed in the building directory, and people continue to picket outside. Burgess said: 'I have no idea where they are. 'I'm both annoyed and worried.' Before Mt. Gox's disappearance, Bitcoin . had been heading toward broader acceptance in spite of wild swings in value . in the past year. For most of the currency's history, each digital coin . had been worth less than $10. New Bitcoins are 'mined' or generated by computers, and they get harder to . generate all the time, which means the inflow of fresh Bitcoins keeps . falling. Today, there are about . 12.4 million Bitcoins in circulation, according to Blockchain, a . public registry of Bitcoin transactions. The maximum number of Bitcoins . that can be generated is 21 million, and it is estimated that by 2032, 99 per cent of those . will have been created.

"By . John Drayton . Barcelona president Josep Bartomeu has said the club are in the market for 'a forward and defenders' as they continue their efforts to sign Luis Suarez from Liverpool. The Catalan giants are looking to rebuild after finishing last season without a major trophy, the first time that has happened in six years. And, as Liverpool and Barcelona officials meet to discuss a deal for Suarez, Bartomeu has confirmed that the club are looking to add a striker to their side. Arrival: Josep Bartomeu, pictured at the unveiling of Ivan Rakitic, confirmed Barcelona want a new striker . The Barcelona president said: 'We have the names and the players, but sometimes there are clubs who speculate over possible signings by Barca to manipulate the price. All I can say is that they are names that have been agreed with (new coach) Luis Enrique and they excite us.' Bartomeu added: 'For example, (sporting director Andoni) Zubizarreta already has the names of the centre backs although they are not signed yet as there are clubs who think their value will go up after the World Cup.' Barca hired Luis Enrique, a former player with the club, to replace Gerardo Martino, who stepped down after a disappointing debut season in 2013-14. On the move? Liverpool and Barcelona will open negotiations over the transfer of Luis Suarez . Controversial: Suarez has been linked with a move to Barcelona after being banned for four months . The team often looked toothless in attack, despite the presence of Lionel Messi and Neymar, and the defence was shambolic at times, conceding far too often from set pieces. Not only have the Catalans been linked with Suarez, centre-back Jeremy Mathieu is said to be pushing to join from La Liga rivals Valencia. Bartomeu said some players would have to leave to make way for new arrivals but left open whether midfielder Xavi, who at 34 is coming to the end of a glittering career, would play on for another campaign. Gone: Suarez (right) has been sent home from the World Cup for biting Italy's Giorgio Chiellini . All smiles: This is what Suarez would like if Barcelona managed to seal his signature from Liverpool . Swap deal? Barcelona's Alexis Sanchez could be moving in the opposite direction to Suarez . 'He has won the right to decide what he thinks is right and we will help him however he wants,' Bartomeu said. 'If it was another player we would be the ones saying what he had to do but seeing as it's Xavi we are giving him time. The day he leaves he will pass into history as the most successful player we have ever had.' Chilean Alexis Sanchez is one man who has been linked with a move away from the Nou Camp, but Bartomeu said that Barcelona were 'counting on him' for next season.","Josep Bartomeu confirms club are looking for a forward and defenders .

Labour MP Helen Goodman described the village on the edge of her constituency as being famous for its beautiful waterfalls and deep caves during a speech at the Village Fayre and Classic Vehicle Show.

Today, Ms Goodman - who is accused of . basing her speech from the Wikipedia entry for the other Ingleton - . laughed off the mistake by calling it 'a simple accident'. Nick Biggin, a local resident who works at The Black Horse pub in Ingleton said: 'I think it’s definitely arrogance.

'But as an MP for this constituency she should know better, you should know the area that you are serving.'

High street: Ingleton in Yorkshire is much larger - and has a bustling centre with shops and pubs, pictured . Neil Flowers, a member of the show’s organising committee said: 'She obviously does not know the place and whoever had done the research for the speech had not got it right. 'A lot of what she said is mentioned in the first part of the Wikipedia entry for that Ingleton. 'She spoke about our links with Sir Arthur Conan Doyle who was a regular visitor and got married at the other Ingleton, but doesn't mean much in this one. 'It didn’t make her look very good. I spoke to one or two people who had realised what she’d done. 'I think that if it had being pointed out to her it would have made it more embarrassing. Attractions: St John's Church in County Durham, pictured, is one of the few attractions in the village - which is a short distance from Darlington and is on the edge of the MP's constituency . Impressive: St Marys Parish Church in the North Yorkshire village - which was visited regularly by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle as his mother lived in the region .

"By . Anthony Bond . A prisoner has admitted disembowelling and murdering a child rapist during a brutal attack at a top-security jail. Mitchell Harrison, 23, was serving an indefinite sentence at Frankland Prison, Durham, for raping a 13-year-old girl when he was brutally killed last October. He was attacked with makeshift weapons, thought to be razor blades melted into toothbrush handles. His bloodied body was found in his cell by warders. Attack: Michael Parr, right, pleaded guilty in Newcastle Crown Court yesterday to murdering Mitchell Harrison, left, at Frankland Prison in Durham last year . Speaking shortly after his . murder, a source close to the prison said: ‘To all intents and purposes . he had been disembowelled. There was blood everywhere.' Michael Parr, 32, pleaded guilty to murder during a brief hearing at Newcastle Crown Court yesterday via videolink from prison. Nathan Mann, 23, is also charged with Harrison’s murder but he did not appear before the court. Harrison, from Wolverhampton, was jailed in January 2010 for raping a girl in Cumbria. He was jailed at Carlisle Crown Court indefinitely and was put on the sex offenders’ register for life. Violent: Harrison was killed with makeshift weapons, thought to be razor blades melted into toothbrush handles at Frankland Prison, Durham, last year . A pathologist found that he had died of 'multiple injuries' and his death led to the prison being criticised. Criminology expert Professor David Wilson, of Birmingham City . University, said the extremely violent nature of the attack was . significant. Accused: Nathan Mann, 23, is also charged with Harrison's murder but did not appear before the court yesterday . He said: ‘The question is how can something like this take place in Frankland and why didn’t the staff protect him?’ The judge who sent Harrison to prison said he posed a ‘substantial risk’ to young girls. He lured his teenage victim to his flat in Kendal, Cumbria, in 2009. Once inside he ordered her to strip before raping her twice. It was the third time Harrison had been in trouble for sexually assaulting girls. When he was 13 he was given a formal warning for indecently assaulting a . seven-year-old and when he was 15 he was taken to court for threatening . to rape a 15-year-old classmate. After his murder, Harrison’s family released a statement saying: 'Although we never condoned his past actions, he was serving his time and was by all accounts a model, trusted prisoner who did not deserve to die in this horrific way.' Parr will be sentenced on July 12. Charged with murder: A prison van transports Nathan Mann, 23, and Michael Parr, 32, into Peterlee Magistrates Court in County Durham .

Not only did he come face-to-face with a fully-grown lion, he washed the big cat with a soapy sponge like it was a car. The incredible viral footage shows the man, reportedly a Yemeni lion breeder, forcefully scrubbing the animal's head, belly and even genitals - and the lion generally didn't seem to mind.

At one point, the giant creature jumped up in protest but the fearless man yelled and pushed its head down before resuming the wash. The man later dragged the lion by its leg when it tried to edge away. El Arabiya News reported the scene may not be unusual in Yemen, known as a breeding hub for wildlife animals which are sold to rich collectors in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and the Emirates. According to a 2013 Guardian report, animal husbandry has become popular and profitable in Yemen, where the price of lion cabs can reach more than $13,000 (50,000 Saudi riyals) each. 'Animal trafficking represents an enormous opportunity to people in one of Yemen's poorest regions,' the reporter Joe Sheffer wrote.

"By . Eleanor Crooks, Press Association . Amelie Mauresmo will leave thoughts of the future until after Andy Murray completes the defence of his Wimbledon title. Murray has not dropped a set on his way to the quarter-finals, where he is likely to face his stiffest test against 11th seed Grigor Dimitrov on Wednesday. The defending champion's excellence means Mauresmo's first experience of being Murray's coach at a grand slam has been largely stress-free. Short term: Amelie Mauresmo (right) is focusing on Andy Murray's (left) Wimbledon title defence . Future: Murray's coach says she will see after the grass court season finishes where she stands . Decision: The relationship was originally agreed just for the grass court season but could be extended . VIDEO Murray training with Mauresmo . Murray and Mauresmo's partnership is initially just for the grass-court season, although the idea from the start was for it to develop into something long term provided both are happy with how things go. The pair have not had any discussions about the future yet, with Mauresmo saying: 'I think we are both focusing on what's going on here and we'll see for that later.' Mauresmo was thrust into the limelight immediately when Murray announced her as his new coach after losing in the semi-finals of the French Open. They have had to do their bonding largely in front of the cameras but both have seemed happy and relaxed on the practice courts and Mauresmo is delighted with how things are going. 'Things are smooth,' she said. 'Everyone has really made me welcome in the team and I've got to know them all much better now. Things are smoother and smoother, I would say.' Dimitrov has been hyped since he was a junior and that only increased when his then coach Peter Lundgren rated him as better than Roger Federer at 18. High flyer: Murray has yet to drop a set on his way to the quarter-finals at Wimbledon . Watching brief: Mauresmo watches her new charge Murray on Centre Court in the fourth round . The nickname of Baby Fed has proved hard to shake off but Dimitrov is starting to become a force in his own right. Since linking up with tough Australian coach Roger Rasheed last October, the 23-year-old has won titles on all surfaces and reached his first grand slam quarter-final at the Australian Open. He is now through to that stage for a second time and is on an eight-match winning streak after succeeding Murray as Queen's Club champion two weeks ago. Murray, who came close to hiring Rasheed as his coach in 2011 before plumping for Ivan Lendl, said: 'He's a more mature player now, I think. 'He makes better decisions on the court than he used to. Watching him play, his strokes and stuff, technically he hasn't made many changes to his game. Form: Murray has won his last 11 straight matches at Wimbledon and is the defending champion . On the move: Murray's bid to reach defend his Wimbledon title sees his face Grigory Dimitrov in the last eight . 'But he's playing higher-percentage tennis, making better decisions. That adds up to winning many more matches. 'He can obviously hit a lot of different shots. He has a lot of variety in his game. Sometimes it takes time to know how to use that properly. He's starting to do that now. 'He's starting to come into his prime. He's won a lot of matches this year. He's a tough player. It will be a hard match for me.' Hello sirs!

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A 65-year-old man photographed following the terror attack at the Boston Marathon in a wheel chair, his face covered in blood and screaming in agony as a medical worker cares for his wounded leg, may lose his sight and suffer brain damage as his wife remains on a respirator. Eric Whalley was at the race with his wife, Ann, when the two bombs went off near the finish line. Their son, Richard, saw the now iconic picture of his father posted on the internet and frantically tried to find out whether his parents were alive. Horror: Eric Whalley, 65, is treated by medics after being caught up in the Boston bombings . Childhood sweethearts: Eric and Ann Whalley, both 65, moved to the US with their two sons in 1989 after growing up in Cockermouth . 'There was a possibility my mom was dead,' Whalley, who lives in Cambridge, Mass., told ABC News. 'I knew she was older and pretty close to the blast.' Whalley turned to Facebook for answers. 'This is my dad in the picture in this link: I have no idea where my mum is. They were both bombed. I'm trying to figure out what hospital they are at. Can you help? 'They look pretty severely injured and I'm worried my Mum is dead.' His friends began making calls to hospitals in the area and soon found his parents, who were taken to different locations. 'It was amazing,' said Whalley. The Whalleys, who are hikers and like to walk around the city, have had nearly a dozen surgeries between them to remove multiple ball bearings and nails. Eric Whalley was struck in the skull and eye and may lose his sight. There is also the chance he will suffer brain damage. Ann Whalley has a badly mangled right foot. His father had a blood clot on one side of his brain. He also had orthopedic surgery on his right leg. 'The feet are in especially bad shape,' said Whalley. 'Part of the right foot was blown off.' His parents, who came from England to Colorado in 1990, eventually got U.S. citizenship. This is the frantic Facebook message posted by Richard Whalley when he was unsure what had happened to his parents . Retirement: Mr Whalley is a retired pharmacologist while his wife Ann is an ex-teacher. The couple have two sons Richard, 25, and Chris, 34 . Brutality of the bombings: Caked in dirt and debris and covered in blood, Mr Whalley is wheeled away into an ambulance after the terror attack . On Wednesday night, Whalley had a conversation with his father, who gained consciousness for the first time. 'He was just barely talking, but he was understanding what we said,' according to his son. 'I told him his photo was on the front page of the Daily Mail. He started laughing.' Ann remains on a respirator with more damage to tissue than to bone. 'She is out of shock now,' he said. 'Most of the damage is to her foot. They had to do reconstruction and it's unclear whether or not she'll have mobility. She has to have another surgery.' Richard Whalley and his brother have set up a website to help pay for their parents' medical expenses . Soon after the bombings, Whalley's friends from his alma mater, MIT, created a website to help his parents with their medical expenses. They both will require at least two more weeks of hospitalization and extensive rehabilitation.","Eric Whalley seen being wheeled from scene of carnage with blood covered face and screaming in pain .

"By . Darren Boyle . Mr Murphy, pictured, said he now wanted to take a case to the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons to make a formal complaint against Gunner's treatment . A much-loved pet dog was accidentally given a lethal injection by a vet – who then told its owner: ‘Mistakes do happen.’ Nicholas Murphy, 22, took his Jack Russell, Gunner, to the veterinary practice after a persistent cough failed to go away. Staff told Mr Murphy they would give the 14-year-old dog an injection, which he believed to be a dose of antibiotics. But what should have been a routine visit took a tragic turn when it emerged the injection had in fact been a lethal cocktail to put the dog down – not medicine to help with his cough. The mistake only emerged when the vet asked the family if they wanted to bury Gunner at home or at the surgery. And when Mr Murphy – an animal welfare worker himself – questioned the vet about the error, he simply replied: ‘Mistakes do happen.’ The incident at the DJB Denny practice, in  Worcester, left Mr Murphy and his family ‘shellshocked’ and ‘confused’, he said. Mr Murphy, who lives in Worcester with his mother Karen Wood, 48, sister Hannah, 17, and brother Paul, 14, added: ‘He asked us if Gunner had had enough, I just thought he meant of the cough, then he gave him an injection. ‘He never asked us anything about the injection, he just put the needle in Gunner. There was no consent form, and no permission. He admitted he was wrong to me and said he was very sorry.’ Mr Murphy, who has lodged a complaint against the vet, said the lethal injection had been carried out in front of his brother. Gunner, pictured, was taken to the vet in Worcester when the claimed error occurred . Mr Murphy said all Gunner needed was 'stronger tablets' instead of the lethal jab . He added: ‘I never got a chance to say goodbye to Gunner. We had to bring him home and bury him, the whole time we were just in shock, I was numb.’ Vet David Denny yesterday explained how the tragedy had happened. ‘I was told by my receptionist they wanted the dog put down. It was a mistake, an accident, a breakdown of trust. ‘It was a very old dog, but the whole thing was a genuine mistake and I have apologised.’ Ian Holloway, a spokesman for the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons, said it could not  comment on individual cases. He added that it would investigate all complaints received. The Jack Russell was buried at the end of the Murphy's garden in Worcester after his unexpected demise . Gunner's owner, Nicholas Murphy, pictured, said he only brought his dog to the vet to receive treatment for a persistent cough .","Nicholas Murphy said he brought Gunner to the vet because of a cough .

"By . Helen Pow . Nancy Kerrigan has opened up for the . first time about the figure skating scandal that shook the Olympic world . 20 years ago, and said she was shocked to think Tonya Harding could be behind it because the pair 'were friendly.' In . 1994, Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee at the US Figure Skating . Championships by Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and a hit squad to . try to keep her from skating against her rival in the Lillehammer . Olympics. Kerrigan, who recovered and went on to win a silver medal at the games, said she really wanted to believe Harding wasn't involved in the bizarre plot that made worldwide headlines. 'I truly wanted to believe that she had nothing to do with it at all,' the 44-year-old said on Morning Joe Monday. 'Because how could that seem possible that someone you know, I mean we were competitors, but... we were friendly. So to think that anyone you know would deliberately try to hurt you, yeah, it's too bizarre to understand.' Scroll down for video . First interviews: Nancy Kerrigan, pictured Monday, has opened up for the first time about the figure skating scandal that shook the Olympic world 20 years ago . She described a new documentary 'Nancy & Tonya,' which will air on NBC on Sunday, as being 'surreal' to watch. Voice . quivering and hands fidgeting, Kerrigan first watched the one-hour retrospective at a press screening in Sochi. Many entertained . the idea that Harding was linked to the clumsy attack. And even after Gillooly and two associates were arrested, Kerrigan gave Harding the benefit of the doubt. 'I can remember saying even to the FBI, ""Well, maybe Tonya really didn't know. Maybe they did it for her.""' she recalls. 'And they're like, ""Nancy, we can't prove it, but we think she was the mastermind of the whole thing.""' At that point, she said she felt 'disappointment, sadness.' And while Harding still denies having any role, Kerrigan said she doesn't believe her. 'Why would the people around her want to hurt me?' she said on Morning Joe. 'What did they have to gain? I guess she's the only one who really had anything to gain. And I was told ""I know we can't prove it but we're telling you. She did."" I hated hearing it. It stinks. It's sad on so many levels.' When asked if she has forgiven Harding for what happened, she said she doesn't think about it, being a busy mom-of-three. But forgiven, she hasn't. 'I don't know. I don't think about it really. When I read transcripts from the FBI, they planned to kill me at one point. That was one of the options. To kill me over a sporting event. That's crazy,' she said. 'There were all these other brutal options that they were thinking about doing to me. I've moved on i don't think about it as forgiveness. I just hope she's happy... and can be able to move on.

'It . made me think about everything all over again,' Kerrigan said after the . screening of 'Nancy & Tonya.' 'It's . surprising how this whole event and being attacked, it's changed not . just skating, it changed my life. It changed tabloid journalism, reality . television. That whole other aspect that I had no part of. It just . moved the world, almost, in a different direction. Whether it's for the . better or not, who knows? It just changed everything.'

It touched off a staggering scandal that pushed figure skating into the mainstream and made the camera-shy Kerrigan the uncomfortable subject of international fascination. Kerrigan recovered in time to win a silver medal in Lillehammer, while Harding spun out of control. 'It's a little surreal to watch your life and to think, ""That's me,""' Kerrigan, who works for NBC as a skating analyst for the Sochi Games, said after watching the show. 'It's almost like a whole other person at this point. I've changed. Well, I haven't changed really much, just moved on. Things in my life are different. I'm basically the same sort of competitive person, but it's just things move on.' Over it: 'I've apologized so many times,' Harding, pictured here in 1994, said dismissively in the documentary. 'She is not worth my time anymore.' He ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, right, was arrested after the attack . Not forgiven: Kerrigan said she hardly thinks about Tonya Harding, pictured in the documentary, these days but she doesn't forgive her . Attack: Former Olympic figure skater Nancy Kerrigan speaks after a screening of a new documentary about the 1994 attack on her . As Harding parlayed the incident into . a circus sideshow sort of celebrity that included televised boxing . matches and guest commentary spots on hockey TV shows, Kerrigan, a . married mom of three, retreated to the cocoon of family life. She almost never spoke publicly about her experience until just recently as the 20th anniversary approached. During . the screening, a dozen or so people sat near the front of the room. But . Kerrigan sat near the back, out of sight while she watched the show . recap her rise from modest means to skating stardom; the 'whack heard . 'round the world' that jeopardized her Olympic chances; and Harding talk . about a hard-scrabble upbringing while continuing to deny she had any . role in the attack on Kerrigan. 'I've apologized so many times,' Harding said dismissively in the show. 'She is not worth my time anymore.' 'When you see someone struggle from the beginning, that's hard and I feel for her,' Kerrigan said. 'It doesn't excuse poor judgment. I hope now, after all this, for not just my sake but her sake, too. She has a family. Let's move on. You've got to allow people that chance to get on with their lives and try to be better and learn from mistakes.' As much as she expressed a desire to move past it Friday, there were times when it was clear that there is still some lingering pain and resentment for Kerrigan. When journalist Mary Carillo, who interviewed both Kerrigan and Harding for the piece, was asked about Harding's persistent denial of involvement in the assault, Kerrigan interjected with an exasperated chuckle. 'Wouldn't it be weird to change it now?' Kerrigan said. One of the toughest parts for Kerrigan was to see how some portrayed her as 'an ice princess,' a robotic, occasionally snarky competitor who was mocked for her cries of 'Why? Why?' when she was struck on the knee and when microphones caught her calling a parade at Walt Disney World 'corny.' 'I remember how that felt,' Kerrigan said. 'So watching it, it's upsetting. Why are people like that? I don't understand.' She said she's always been a private person, so when the world turned its camera lens on her in 1994, the harsh light that shined with it was difficult for her to handle. She felt the picture that was painted was unfair and unflattering, a feeling that hasn't faded over time. 'I always wanted to be understood. Who doesn't want to be liked, right?' Kerrigan said, her voice trailing off as she concluded the interview. 'That's all. I'm sorry.'","In 1994, Kerrigan was clubbed in the knee at the US Figure Skating Championships by Harding's ex-husband Jeff Gillooly and a hit squad to try to keep her from skating against Harding in the Lillehammer Olympics .

It would be the start of what would be 17 victims he confessed to killing in all. 'Some people are not going to want any part of it. Some people want a part of it. But there have been families that have lived here since that happened,' real estate agent Gregory Greco told Fox 8 Cleveland during a tour of the home. Scroll down for video .

Former occupant: Serial killer Jeffrey Dahmer is pictured during his trial in the murder of 17 men he confessed to having killed with the first in 1978 . 'Perfect for entertaining,' he said guiding a Fox8 reporter around the roughly 2,200 square-feet home. 'The rooms flow, this room could be a library or office space.

"By . Louise Boyle . Making enemies: Alec Baldwin called movie producer Arki Busson a 'pockmarked toady' in a recent interview . Alec Baldwin has doled out yet another tongue lashing and this time the target of his ire is millionaire investor Arpad Busson. The 30 Rock actor has taken umbrage with Busson, who recently announced a move into movie producing, after he claimed Baldwin was 'only a TV star'. Baldwin told TV Guide: 'He’s a pockmarked toady who hops from . yacht to yacht and bed to bed. 'So when some bloated little toad like . Busson labels me a certain way, I say to myself, ''Consider the source.'' 'If movie stardom meant being trapped on a yacht with Busson, I’d rather . be a weatherman for Ch. 4 in New York.' It appears that Baldwin crossed paths with Busson, who is the partner of Uma Thurman, in Cannes earlier this year. Baldwin, 55, who is launching his own MSNBC talk show, also used the interview as an opportunity to air his grievances against Hollywood movie bosses, saying that they were clueless when it came to making films. The actor said: 'They’re all factotums of multilateral corporations. It’s all money, money, money.' However Baldwin did express admiration for Steven Spierlberg, adding: 'He doesn’t have to go to one of the douchebags from Warner Bros. and explain to them why his movie is marketable.' Baldwin has been given his own Friday night TV talk show called Up Late With Alec Baldwin. It begins next month. New target: Millionaire investor Arpad Busson (pictured with his partner Uma Thurman, left, and ex Elle Macpherson, right) has attracted the ire of Alec Baldwin after announcing a move into movie producing . The rant is the latest from Baldwin, who recently became a father again to daughter Carmen with second wife, 29-year-old Hilaria. The actor also has a 17-year-old daughter Ireland with ex-wife Kim Basinger. Baldwin is known for his fiery outbursts. Last month he tackled a photographer in New York City who he believed had come too close to him and Hilaria while they were out for a stroll. The couple did not have their baby daughter with them at the time. Photos of the scene appear to show the angry actor first warning off the male photographer then manhandling him over the hood of a parked car. No charges were made against Baldwin or the photographer following the incident. Age: 55 . Origins: Born in Amityville, New York, he has three brothers and two sisters. Relationship status: He is currently married to Hilaria, a 29-year-old yoga instructor. The couple married in 2012 and she gave birth to their first child, a daughter Carmen, in August. He was previously married to Kim Basinger who he split from in an acrimonious divorce in 2002 after being married for nine years. The couple had a bitter custody battle over daughter Ireland, now a 17-year-old model. Wealth: Estimated at $65million. Baldwin reportedly takes home $150,000 an episode for 30 Rock. He is the face of Capital One Bank for which he has publicly donated $10.5 million fees to various charities. Controversy: The reputation of Baldwin's fiery temper often precedes him. He has had several run-ins with photographers, some ending in physical altercations. In 2011, he was removed from a flight in LA because he would not stop playing a game on his phone for take-off. In 2007, during his divorce battle with Kim Basinger, Baldwin left a voicemail for his daughter, calling her a 'rude, thoughtless little pig'. He later apologized. Age: 50 . Origins: Boulogne-Billancourt, France. He served as a medic in the French army before delving into the world of hedge funds in 1986. He is also known for his involvement in philanthropic causes around the world. Relationship status: He is currently in a relationship with Uma Thurman, who gave birth to the couple's first child Rosalind Arusha Arkadina Altalune Florence Thurman-Busson, (known as Luna) in July 2012. He was previously in a relationship with model Elle Macpherson from 1996 until 2005. The couple have two sons Arpad Flynn and Aurelius Cy Andrea. Wealth: Busson had an estimated wealth of $200million this year, according to a French investment magazine. Controversy: Arpad Busson reportedly made his first money as a toothpick salesman, a claim which the multimillionaire vehemently denies. As a young man, he dated actress Farrah Fawcett, who was 16 years older than him, after meeting her on the French Riviera. The financier's EIM Group is believed to have been a victim of Bernie Madoff's Ponzi scheme in 2008. Looking mellow: Baldwin took a break from his fiery outbursts on Friday as he accompanied wife Hilaria and their newborn daughter to breakfast . Fatherhood: Alec Baldwin and Arpad Busson have both embraced fatherhood again in their fifties . The actor has previously been involved in altercations with both . reporters and photographers, and admits he struggles to deal with the . interest in his private life. Earlier this year the 30 Rock star told Gothamist: ‘The one element of . culpability I have is I did let it get to me, and I have been . confrontational with them [the press].’ Back in February he allegedly told a . reporter to 'choke to death' after she questioned him about a lawsuit . involving his wife Hilaria's work as a yoga instructor.","The 30 Rock actor had a tongue-lashing for Busson after he told Baldwin he is 'only a TV star'

"By . Associated Press . and Daily Mail Reporter . The death of a leader: Stephen Gaskin, founder of The Farm, died on Tuesday at his home on the commune, surrounded by family. Pictured above attending a New Zealand festival in 1981 . Stephen Gaskin, a visionary who established one of the country's oldest surviving communes, located in rural Middle Tennessee, died Tuesday at the age of 79. Gretchen Bates, who grew up on the 'The Farm' and is close to Gaskin's family, told The Associated Press that Gaskin died of natural causes at his home on the Summertown commune. A message on The Farm's website reads: 'We mourn the passing of Stephen Gaskin, our founder and friend. Our community would not exist, were it not for his bravery and free spirit.' Gaskin was a Korean War veteran who became a hippie guru in the late 60s, teaching English at San Francisco State College. In . 1970, Gaskin led a caravan of 60 school buses carrying about 320 . hippies to 1,750 acres of rough ridge country where they founded the . back-to-basics collective. The collective bought the land from a local moonshiner who sold it to them for the cheap price of $70 an acre. According . to their website, the group's mission was: 'To live a . ""back-to-the-land"" lifestyle while still remaining engaged in social . change to make the world a better place.' They . pooled their money and started making decisions by consensus. Within . four years the original settlers had bought the land, erected buildings . with salvaged wood, found water supplies and became agriculturally . self-sufficient. Those who . joined The Farm had to accept Gaskin as their spiritual guru but he . preferred being known as a teacher and not a leader. A teacher: Gaskin became a hippie guru in the 1960s when he started teaching at San Francisco State College. Pictured above lecturing at one of his weekly classes before the founding of the Farm . Back to basics: In 1970, Gaskin and a group of 320 hippies moved to a plot of land in Middle Tennessee to start The Farm . He . described the difference in an early 1970s essay, saying: 'I'm a . teacher, not a leader. If you lost your leader, you're leaderless and . lost, but if you lose your teacher there's a chance that he taught you . something and you can navigate on your own.' Gaskin . personally ran into problems though in 1976 when it was discovered that . marijuana was being grown on the commune during a raid. Gaskin denied knowing about the weed, but took responsibility and went to prison. Working the land: Within four years, the settlers had bought the land, erected buildings with salvaged wood, found water supplies and were agriculturally self-sufficient. Above, workers on the farm pictures in December 1971 . Spiritual guide: In order to live on The Farm you had to accept Gaskin as spiritual leader, but he preferred to be known as a teacher . All together: Members of the commune pooled resources and worked jobs to keep The Farm running . 'The . cops said, ""Whose pot is this?""' Mr. Gaskin recalled to The Tennessean . in 2013. 'And I said, ""We're a collective. What's here is part mine.""' He . served one year of a three-year sentence, and after being released . successfully fought in the Tennessee Supreme Court to have his voting . rights restored. When he returned to the farm, he married wife Ina May Middleton, a nationally-recognized midwife. By . 1980, The Farm's population soared to more than 1,200 and they were . finally breaking even. They even branched out of farming and into . printing, construction and solar power. Early years: When the hippies first arrived in Tennessee, they lived out of tents until they could finish building homes . Gathering place: The Farm members gather in one of the commune's buildings in 1976, when about 800 lived in the community . Farm children: An unidentified member of The Farm poses with her child on September 2, 1976 . But a financial crisis a few years later led to a reorganization in which members began paying monthly dues. Currently, . The Farm has about 200 residents. Most of them work in nearby towns, . while others work within the community for homegrown industries like a . book publishing company and soy dairy. In a 1997 interview with NewsChannel5, Gaskin laughed as he described The Farm was a 'gated community of not-rich people'. In . addition to his work on The Farm, Gaskin ran an unsuccessful campaign . in 2000 to become presidential nominee for the Green Party. Four years later, his work on The Farm was recognized when he was inducted into the Counterculture Hall of Fame. For the past few years, Gaskin has remained out of the public eye due to vision and health problems. He died at home on Tuesday, surrounded by family. The Farm community members have not yet announced plans for Gaskin's funeral. Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","Gaskin died Tuesday at his home on The Farm, surrounded by family .

"By . Luke Salkeld . Quick! Somebody fetch the nachos. Well. Make that several bags of nachos. Meet the Avozilla –  a monster avocado that is  five times heavier than its rather more modestly proportioned cousin. At 3lb, it could make enough guacamole to feed an army. Or at least a very hungry family. Super-sized: Tesco buyer Emma Bonny shows how large an avozilla is compared to a standard avocado . And once you have scooped out the flesh, the extra thick skin can be used as a bowl for all that dip. The Avozilla is grown only on  trees belonging to one of the world’s biggest suppliers of  avocados in South Africa. The fruit is double the length and five times the weight of the standard variety, measuring seven-and-a-half inches. It goes on sale today at Tesco, for £3. The supermarket’s salad buyer, Emma . Bonny, said: ‘The Avozilla has a fantastic taste with a rich, juicy, . buttery texture, and creamy flavour. Feed the family: The avozilla costs £3 and dwarves this egg and standard avocado . The avozilla is almost five inches long and weighs about 1.3 kilograms on average and will go on sale for £3 . ‘The ripe fruit is an attractive . vivid green colour – different from the darker-coloured smaller variety – . and its thick skin can actually be used as a serving bowl for . guacamole. ‘Avocados are full of nutrients and . vitamins, and by stocking these big varieties, we’re making it easier . than ever before for our customers to eat healthily. ‘We believe the Avozilla will appeal to shoppers who are looking for value for money, but especially large families.’ Once a comparatively niche food, . avocados have become an everyday shopping basket favourite. She . explained: ‘Avocados are one of our fastest-growing areas in produce, . with a staggering 30 per cent growth so far this year.’ Deputy Femail Editor Toni Jones taste-tested the giant fruit at a summer barbeque in Sydenham. She said: 'I surprised my foodie friends with the monster fruit and, after over-analysing the possible calorie content, we all decided that he is a must-have BBQ accessory.

An air and ground search failed to locate her. . According to Sheriff's spokeswoman Cindy Bachman, ‘suspicious circumstances’ surround the woman's disappearance and foul play hasn't been ruled out. Homicide detectives reportedly have been involved in the investigation. Corwin is three months' pregnant. She and her husband, Marine Cpl. Jonathan Corwin, are from Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and live at the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center in Twentynine Palms.

"By . Joshua Gardner . An Oregon couple were arrested Tuesday after a year during which they allegedly stalked and threatened mountain bike riders and their unleashed dogs on a Portland area hiking trail. Victims say that David Gathwright, 60, and his wife Pamela Gathwright, 57, would angrily confront them and their dogs on the Sandy Ridge trail while brandishing mace and stun guns. One mountain biker said Mr. Gathwright even threatened to shoot him with a handgun. Must hate dogs: Victims say that David Gathwright, 60, and his wife Pamela Gathwright, 57, would angrily confront them and their dogs on the Sandy Ridge trail while brandishing mace and stun guns . Their arrest comes after a year of reports cropping up about their bizarre antics. Authorities told KOIN in May that the investigation was taking so long in part because many victims took their stories to social media rather than to police. But if those posts are any indication, many people had dangerous and downright weird encounters with the Gathwrights over the last year. 'Last night the crazy gun toting, bear mace your dog couple struck again to my friend m*****,' wrote Brian F. on the Sandy Ridge Trailhead Mountain bikers Facebook page. Brian wrote that the couple maced his friend's dog and that the man had pulled his gun on two people he knows. 'They don't like dogs or bikers and hike the trails,' he wrote. While some say the couple was motivated by an intense fear of dogs, others say they were also angered by mountain bikers in general on the trail. Chris Hess encountered the Gathwrights along with his wife Angela, their daughters and dogs. The alleged encounters occurred at the Portland area's Sandy Ridge trail, which is made for mountain biking. Dogs are required to be on a leash on the trail . 'I remember staring down the barrel of the gun': Chris Hess encountered the Gathwrights along with his wife Angela, their daughters and dogs . 'The lady leaned down with something in her hand and the dogs were interested, but it was a stun gun and she was sparking it, trying to shock them,' Angela told KOIN about a March 2013 encounter.Things escalated after their daughter tried defending the dogs. 'We didn’t see the gun until it came out,' Angela said. 'The guy drew down right on Chris, right in his face.' Chris remembered the moment well. 'I remember staring down the barrel of the gun,' he said. After the Clackamas authorities spent a year or longer tracking down victims and thanks to some victims who followed the couple after an encounter to get their address for police, the Gathwrights have been charged. Charges against Mr. Gathwright include unlawful use of a weapon, menacing and pointing a firearm at another. His bail was set at $50,000. Mrs. Gathwright is charged with attempted harassment and attempted animal abuse, with bail set at $25,000.","David and Pamela Gathwright were charged with attempted harassment and attempted animal abuse after a year-long investigation with multiple victims .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . Police in Minnesota arrested a man Tuesday after he wrecked his family's van and then left his badly injured children behind as he fled the scene following an argument with the children's mother. Doctors say there's a chance that one of Earl Lionell Ward's children might never walk again. Authorities say Ward had driven off with the children sleeping in the back of the van after their mother got out of the vehicle after she says Ward threatened her while driving home from a drive-in movie near St. Paul.

Injured: The family fears Amarya West (right) will never walk again, while Almond (left) underwent surgery for a broken femur and a severed artery in his leg . Wreck: Police say Ward ran into this construction hole at a high rate of speed throwing his children to the front of the van . Ward, who has an extensive criminal history including charges of domestic assault and drug violations, already has been charged with assaulting the woman, Della Svenningsen, on a previous occasion. According to TwinCities.com, Svenningsen said she was planning to leave Ward with the children because he had started using drugs. After the movie, Svenningsen says she went to the bathroom, and when she returned it smelled like someone had been smoking either crack or heroin. Her son, 20, confirmed that he had seen Ward smoking something while she was in the restroom. The couple fought as they left the drive-in, until Svenningsen says she felt threatened so she got out of the vehicle. After getting out, she says she soon heard a crash and could her children screaming from a block away. When she found her children they very seriously injured. Fourteen-year-old Amarya West's neck was broken, and the family has been told she might not walk again. Almond West, 8, had a broken femur and a severed artery in that leg. He and his sister both underwent surgery Tuesday, their aunt said. Acting on a tip, police found the 45-year-old father at a relative's home in St. Paul and arrested him without incident Tuesday evening. Scared: The children's mother, Della Svenningsen, got out of the van after she says Ward threatened her . Tragic: Almond West fractured his femur and severed an artery in his leg in the crash . Caution: Police have since put up more caution tape around the construction hole, which they say is about eight inches deep . Ward, who has a long criminal history, had warrants for his arrest in two cases he's been charged in -- domestic assault and violation of domestic-abuse no-contact order. Svenningsen was the victim in both, the charges say. The family was coming from Lake Elmo's Vali-Hi Drive In early Tuesday. They'd just seen the current Transformers movie and 22 Jump Street, said Tracie Svenningsen, Della's sister. 'They had a nice, fun family day, and it ended in tragedy,' she said. Della Svenningsen said she didn't expect Ward to drive off when she got out of the minivan's driver's seat Tuesday. She said she didn't think he would hurt his kids because he never had before. The accident happened when Ward drove into a large construction hole in the road, Paulos said. He was driving fast enough that his children, sleeping in the back of the vehicle, were thrown forward, Paulos said.","Police say Earl Ward and his family were leaving a drive-in movie when he began to fight with his children's mother .

Officers pulled over the mother-of-two's vehicle earlier this month and violated her freedom of speech, the group representing her said on Monday. Pamela Konchinsky (pictured) is suing the Indianapolis Police for pulling her over for the 'joke' bumper sticker . 'We . contend that the police officers who detained and interrogated our . client without legal grounds to do so violated her constitutional . rights,' ACLU attorney Kelly Eskew said in a statement. 'The promise of our Constitution is that these lines cannot be crossed.' Konchinsky . was on her way to work on June 17 when she was pulled over in Downtown . Indianapolis and and told: 'With that bumper sticker, someone could . think you're impersonating a police officer', The Indy Star reported. Konchinsky works three jobs and has two children - one an adult, and one a child in school. She . was late for work on the day of the incident and her lawsuit is seeking . unspecified damages, payment for lost wages and legal costs. According to the complaint, Indianapolis police officers told Konchinsky the bumper sticker would make people think she was impersonating a police officer and could get her shot, before demanding that she remove it from her rear window. The bumper stickers are sold for $2.50 online and are intended as a joke. The suit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department spokesman Lieutenant Chris Bailey said the department did not comment on pending litigation.","Pamela Konchinsky, 56, claims the police violated her freedom of speech .

"By . John Drayton . Neymar is fully fit and ready to lead Brazil one step closer to their first World Cup on home soil. Neymar scored the winning penalty against Chile last week, but was battered and bruised by the end of the second-round clash in Belo Horizonte. The Barcelona forward had to leave the pitch for treatment on two occasions after taking knocks to his knee and thigh. Thumbs up: Neymar confirms he is fit to face Colombia . Looking sharp: Ramires (centre) holds off Oscar (left) and Neymar . But Neymar is making good progress in his recovery and says he will be fit to take part in Brazil's quarter-final clash against Colombia in Fortaleza on Friday. Speaking after participating in Brazil's training session at their Teresopolis base, Neymar said: 'I am able to play against Colombia. I have no pain. I feel very well trained and rest assured, I'm fine.' Saturday's penalty shootout win over Chile also took its toll on the players psychologically too. Several of the Brazil squad broke down in tears after the 3-2 shootout win at the Estadio Mineirao. As . a result, coach Luiz Felipe Scolari decided to summon the team's . psychologist to the training ground at the start of the week. Golden touch: Neymar is just one goal behind James Rodriguez in the World Cup scoring charts . Pointing the way: Neymar in training on Wednesday . 'The game against Chile was exciting for everyone,' Neymar was quoted as saying on the Brazilian Football Association's website. But the team does not have any emotional problem in the group.' Brazil may still be favourites to win the World Cup, but the deficiencies in their team are clear for all to see. Their defence looked incredibly creaky against Chile and up front they lack a top class striker to play alongside Neymar. So far, Fred and former Manchester City striker Jo have been far from impressive. All that means more pressure on Neymar, but he has no doubts about his ability nor that of his team-mates. Looking on: Luiz Felipe Scolari casts his eye over training . Helping hand: Luiz Gusta pulls Neymar back to his feet . 'I do not . feel burdened with the obligation to be the highlight,' Neymar said. 'I . have colleagues who help me. Some win the ball, others give passes, . others score goals. We are a team. 'It's not about one player. Here the important thing is that Brazil is champion.' Neymar has certainly dealt with the pressure of being Brazil's top man at this tournament so far. On your bike! Neymar and Marcelo go for a leisurely bike ride before training . The . 22-year-old, who is nothing short of a phenomenon in his homeland, has . scored four goals. Only Colombian sensation James Rodriguez has scored . more. Only . an outstanding team performance will give Brazilians confidence that . their team can win their sixth World Cup this summer, but Neymar does . not care if he and his team-mates scrape another win against Colombia. 'The . last thing we're worried about is putting on a show,' the former Santos . player said. 'If we have to defend all the time to win, then let's do . that. The most important thing is the team qualifying.' Talking tactics: Head coach Scolari speaks to his players .

"By . Associated Press . A member of a prominent western New York family is charged with stealing guns and priceless heirlooms and selling them to fuel her heroin addiction. Elbert Hubbard was a late-19th century writer and artist who founded the Roycroft arts and crafts community near Buffalo, New York - a village that is today on a National Historic Landmark. His great-granddaughter Megan Hubbard-Riley, 22, is a Juggalo and, police say, a drug addict who looted her mother's East Aurora, New York, house four six months and sold off at least $50,000 in journals, papers and furniture that her famous ancestor had made by hand. Arrested: Megan Hubbard-Riley, 22, is facing multiple felony charges, along with her boyfriend, 35-year-old John Lawandus . Write caption here . The Buffalo News reports that Hubbard-Riley and her boyfriend John Lawandus, 35, are accused of swiping at least 13 handguns, including several modern weapons that Hubbard-Riley's mother kept in the house. Lawandus, whose Facebook page prominently announces that he is a Juggalo (a fan of the hip hop group Insane Clown Posse), is accused of helping orchestrate the sale of the weapons to two alleged Buffalo gun runners. Daniel Quinn, 19, and Scott Weed, 27, allegedly bought the guns and sold them on the streets. One of the weapons was used in a June 26 shooting that left an innocent bystander in critical condition. Police tracked the handgun used in the shooting back to Hubbard-Riley's mother, who had reported the weapon stolen. Hubbard founded the Roycroft community in western New York, which made arts and crafts, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . Detectives say Hubbard-Riley and her boyfriend sold off the priceless items from her mother's house to local pawn shops for a fraction of what they were worth. 'It is sad to see something so important to the Hubbard family and people invested in the Roycroft in general lose such valuable items because of a drug habit,' East Aurora, New York, Detectives Patrick Welch told the News. Hubbard-Riley and Lawandus both face multiple felony charges, both from the sale of the weapons and the thefts from Mrs Hubbard's home.","Megan Hubbard-Riley, 22, is the great-granddaughter of Elbert Hubbard, the writer who founded the Roycroft crafts community in western New York .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . A funeral home in a small town in Pennsylvania has added a motorcycle hearse to its lineup last month in hopes of better serving bereaved bikers by bearing their deceased loved ones to the afterlife with a thunderous roar. Heintzelman Funeral Home six months ago tapped Orange County Chopper in Newburgh, New York, to craft a one-of-a-kind two-wheeled hearse with all the trimmings, including an S&S V111 engine and a reverse gear that allows it to back up, according to a press release on the company's website. 'The last thing they want is to be in a four-wheel drive vehicle,' said David Heintzelman, co-owner of the Hellertown-based funeral home. 'They want noise and they want speed.' Heintzelman Funeral Home of Hellertown, Pennsylvania, ordered this custom-built motorcycle hearse to better serve its biker clientele . Paul Teutel Sr, a co-founder of Orange County Chopper who earned television notoriety on the reality series American Chopper, designed the stretch motorcycle, according to WFMZ.com. 'It is a chopper, and it is class,' Heintzelman, who declined to specify the price he paid, told WFMZ. 'The paint is second-to-none. I am so . proud of the paint job. It is a black metal flake with some ghosting of . gold and metal gray,' The hearse can be detached from the motorcycle so that it can be ridden independently of the carriage . Paul Teutel Sr, co-founder of Orange County Chopper and a star of the reality TV series American Chopper, helped design the motorcycle hearse . The toughest part, he said, was figuring out how to attach the casket-carriage to the bike because of the weight distribution, a process that took weeks of preparation. In the end, Orange County designed it with a 'quick disconnect' that allows the motorcycle to be used separately from the casket. The funeral home charges $395 to $595, depending on distance, for the service, for the 'Harley Davidson Hearse with a licensed funeral director as its driver' and wearing the 'attire of all Harley riders.' As for why he did it, Heintzelman said it only makes sense to let people who spent their lives on a motorcycle take their final journey on one as well. The funeral home also offers clients the option of using a horse-drawn coach , in addition to the more conventional Cadillac and Lincoln hearses. 'Those who are bikers, understand and know, they live and breathe the . road,' he said. But the motorcycle hearse doesn't appeal only to bikers, Heintzelman said. 'I actually had a person who had died, a female who was never on a . motorcycle, that was in her late 80s,' he said. Her children 'saw a picture of [the motorcycle hearse] in my arrangement conference room, and they thought this was so cute and . unique, they wanted to have that for their mom.' The roaring motorcycle hearse is driven into a graveyard in Hellertown, Pennsylvania, where David Heintzelman's funeral home is based .

"By . Tamara Cohen, Political Correspondent . Stinging attack: Liberal Democrat diehard Susan Gaszczak wrote a furious open letter to Nick Clegg . A Liberal Democrat activist who accused Lord Rennard of molesting her quit the party in disgust last night after it decided not to censure him. In a stinging open letter to Nick Clegg, Susan Gaszczak said she and four members of her family would be tearing up their membership cards. The former county councillor revealed that a disciplinary review held by the party had ruled earlier this week that there was insufficient evidence the peer broke any rules. This is despite an earlier report by Alistair Webster QC which found broadly credible evidence that he had ‘violated the personal space’ of a string of women. Miss Gaszczak wrote: ‘I can no longer remain a member of a party that feels it is acceptable for the then chief executive to invite me to his hotel room to advance my political career. ‘Even though I have complained, and raised this for over seven years, the party still do not see the complaint as an issue.’ Miss Gaszczak is one of four female activists who spoke out to claim the party’s powerful chief executive had inappropriately touched and propositioned them. In May, Lord Rennard, who had defied Mr Clegg’s advice to say sorry to the women for four months, finally issued a statement admitting he ‘may well have encroached upon personal space’. Although he made a grovelling apology for any harm or embarrassment caused to them, he claimed any such behaviour would have been ‘inadvertent’. Miss Gaszczak’s resignation will pile more pressure on Mr Clegg to throw the peer out of the party – because Lord Rennard’s allies have suggested he is keen to make a comeback as their election strategist. He is still suspended from his post pending an inquiry over the handling of the case brought by Miss Gaszczak, Alison Goldsworthy, Bridget Harris and Alison Smith. Miss Gaszczak added in the letter, published on the Lib Dem Voice website: ‘This week the appeals panel met and threw out our appeal to an unfair process. I have been called credible more than once. Yet still no one feels it is appropriate to deal with the issue.’ She said other alleged victims had come forward since the media storm over the issue, and accused Mr Clegg of failing to take the claims seriously. Comeback: Lord Rennard released a grovelling apology admitting he 'may well have . encroached upon personal space' - but maintained any behaviour would have been . 'inadvertent' ‘Only four of us were brave enough to go public – how many more do you need on public record?’ she wrote. ‘You . have a serious thorn in your side. He claims to have built the party, . but actually I see him destroying it. I wish you the very best for the . future but your personal apology is not enough to keep my membership . current.’ A former . parliamentary candidate for the Liberal Democrats, Miss Gaszczak said . she had put ‘love, effort, sweat and tears’ as well as much of her own . money into helping the party over the years. Both her mother and father – himself a councillor for 24 years – and her son and daughter have also resigned their Lib Dem membership in protest. A party spokesman said: ‘We are saddened that Susan Gaszczak has made this decision which was clearly very difficult for her. She has been a devoted and passionate campaigner for the Liberal Democrat cause over many years and will be sorely missed by many in the party. ‘The Liberal Democrats recognise the seriousness of these complaints and that there was a failure in our processes which meant action was not taken sooner.’ Mr Clegg is also accused of being slow to respond to claims of serious sexual misconduct by Mike Hancock, the Portsmouth MP, who made unwanted advances toward a vulnerable female constituent. The Webster report concluded it was ‘unlikely that it could be established beyond reasonable doubt that Lord Rennard had intended to act in an indecent or sexually inappropriate way’.","Susan Gaszczak said party still do not see Rennard complaint 'as an issue'

"By . Alan Simpson . It may have traditionalists spluttering into their drams. But a German supermarket chain is offering Scots cut-price kilts and a set of bagpipes for less than £33. The poly viscose kilt retails at a penny under £20, while the bagpipes are only £12.99. Those who want to add a polyester ghillie shirt can do so for £12.99 – along with a no-frills leather sporran and chain at £9.99 and socks for £3.99. Canny Scot: German supermarket chain Lidl is offering Scots cut-price kilts and a set of bagpipes for less than £33 in the run up to the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games . The £46.96 Highland Dress outfit will go on sale in all Lidl stores in Scotland in the run-up to the start of the Glasgow 2014 Commonwealth Games on July 23. Three tartans are on offer – Black Watch, Royal Stewart and Granite Grey – and they are the cheapest kilts ever to go on sale. The kilt has a 24in drop and, unravelled, measures five yards – three yards short of traditional specifications. Music to your ears? Traditional bagpipes start at £1,200, whereas this Lidl version of the instrument is on sale for just £12.99 . SLANJ Kilts uses only traditional handwoven material – and owner Brian Halley is in no doubt he would lose customers quickly if he introduced poly viscose versions manufactured in the Far East. Yesterday, we took the Lidl kilt to Mr Halley’s shop in Glasgow city centre for his expert verdict. He said: ‘You get what you pay for. This is a £20 kilt and it is worth that. It is not a bad kilt. 'I’m not going to criticise shops that would sell them as they bring in a lot of money for the country from tourists, but our shop would lose customers. ‘They are very popular with stag weekenders who buy them for trips abroad. They can also be put in the washing machine, which is not a bad thing after a stag weekend. ‘But we wouldn’t be able to even buy the material for £20. You can see the difference immediately when you see a poly viscose kilt beside a traditional one. ‘They look and feel completely different and most Scots would rather have a traditional one, despite our standard Black Watch kilt starting off at £350. ‘You get what you pay for – and the vast majority of Scots would rather pay the extra knowing they will have a kilt for life.’ But Scottish kiltmakers are not . impressed, claiming cheap and cheerful kilts produced overseas from . man-made fibres are affecting their trade. Ken MacDonald, a governor of the Scottish . Tartans Authority and owner of Houston Kiltmakers in Paisley, . Renfrewshire, said: ‘A lot of imported stuff is from places such as . India and China. ‘However, the majority of folk want to buy something that is high quality and will last a lifetime. The problem is that when someone goes online and sees a kilt for sale at £20 and then a real one at £300, they just assume a kilt is a kilt and go for the cheaper one. ‘Kilts are symbolic of Scotland, but tourists are probably unaware they are buying a garment made in the Far East which is not Scottish.’ Lidl spokesman Alasdair Fowle was unable to confirm in which country its kilts were manufactured, but said the supplier was a Scottish firm. He added: ‘This fantastic range at unbelievably low prices will allow the people of Scotland to not only showcase Scotland’s proud heritage and traditions, but will give everyone the chance to really get behind Team Scotland. ‘Traditionally, Highland wear can be quite expensive, which prevents a lot of people from purchasing it, so it’s great to be able to offer everyone in Scotland the chance to buy a kilt for under £20.’ Standard traditional kilts retail for around £350 and are made from wool. A Jacobite shirt is about £65, a sporran can cost £300 and a top-of-the-range dress kilt can be as much as £700. Traditional bagpipes start at £1,200. Also for sale as part of the Scotland at Lidl range are junior ‘playable’ bagpipes in Black Watch, Royal Stewart or Mackenzie tartan for £12.99, along with a tartan hip flask at £6.99. Ladies can buy Royal Stewart mini-kilts for only £16.99.

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Roger Federer strolled on to a Centre Court that felt more like the venue for a  wake than a rocking sports arena, the crowd still reeling from seeing Andy Murray’s demise. It was a more muted  reception than the seven-time  champion has become accustomed to and he offered little to immediately restore order, dropping the first set to fellow Swiss Stanislas Wawrinka in 30 minutes. But Federer was unruffled, smoothing a crease from his shirt and running a hand through his hair before grinding out the second set and  powering to a 3-6, 7-6, 6-4, 6-4 victory. At the net he embraced his good friend and stopped to sign autographs as he left. Dominant: Roger Federer celebrates after beating Stanislas Wawrinka in the quarter-finals at Wimbledon . On form: Federer fist pumps in front of a roaring crowd after taking the third set on Centre Court . Frustration: Wawrinka slammed his racket to the ground after losing the crucial set . Tough day: After losing the second set, the Swiss Australian Open winner receives treatment from the physio . Down but not out: Federer is floored during a rally against his Swiss compatriot . Federer looked more like a man who had enjoyed a brisk walk in the park than a 2hr 55min slog on the lawn. He now faces his 35th Grand Slam semi-final and his ninth at SW19. Rather ominously for Friday’s opponent, 23-year-old Milos Raonic, he has gone on to reach the final on all but one of those occasions and the only time he has lost on the second Sunday at the All England Club was to Rafael Nadal in a 2008 epic. ‘It’s a comfortable place to be,’ said Federer. ‘You know there is a chance now to go a step further because you trust your game and you’ve been there before so many times.’ The 32-year-old has won all  four confrontations with big-serving Canadian Raonic, most recently at the Australian Open this year. Raonic is one of an emerging group challenging the Big Four along with Grigor Dimitrov,  Kei Nishikori and Nick Kyrgios. Nadal and Murray have already fallen to this thrusting talent. ‘It’s exciting to see new faces,’ said Federer. ‘We still don’t have enough teenagers. It’s just hard breaking through for a youngster to win or be consistent over five matches in a row and get those ranking points.’ Classy: He lost the first set, but the king of grass looked his usual self thereafter . Federer’s progress has been so imperious that it was not until the fourth game of yesterday’s match — 6hr 9min into his title challenge — that his serve was broken for the first time. Wawrinka converted the second and sealed the first set with a supersonic forehand. He maintained his level in the second set, taking Federer to a tiebreak. But even as he ages Federer retains a magic touch and a beautiful volley set him up to take the set. Wawrinka was reduced to a shell of a man thereafter and later admitted to being exhausted after playing for the third consecutive day. Controversial scheduling meant his third-round match against Denis Istomin was held over from Friday to Monday. ‘It was tough to play three days in a row, especially when I played the third against Roger,’ said Wawrinka. ‘It cost me a lot of energy but Roger deserved to win.’ Out of reach: Warwinka stretches to return against the number four seed . Support: Mirka Federer watches on from the box on Centre Court . Federer does not only have a youngster to deal with on court tomorrow but four more at home. He admitted to struggling to balance looking after his two sets of twins — five-year-old girls Myla Rose and Charlene Riva and two-month-old boys Leo and Lenny. ‘I need to be on the same wavelength with my wife (Mirka) on how we raise our kids,’ Federer said. ‘They sleep much better now (but) the daytimes are very busy.’ Federer’s only real grumble was directed at the All England Club, who rigorously enforced their all-white outfit rule. ‘It’s too strict,’ he said. ‘If you look at the pictures of Edberg, Becker ... there was some  colours. But I respect. Maybe one day they’ll loosen the grip.’","Roger Federer advanced to the 2014 Wimbledon semi-final, bouncing back from a set down against Stanislas Warwinka to win in four .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Beavers living in the Devon countryside are to be rounded up by minsters and sent to live in a zoo, it can be revealed. Environment Secretary Owen Paterson, who once complained about badgers ‘moving goalposts’ when carrying out a cull, has now turned his attention to the first family of wild beavers seen for 800 years. Instead of ordering them to be killed, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is trying to find a home for them in captivity, to the anger of wildlife campaigners. At least three beavers are living in Devon, and have been filmed grooming themselves, gnawing the base of trees and playing together . The wild beavers have been filmed gnawing on trees in the dead of night on the River Otter, near Ottery St Mary. Three were seen on camera, but experts suspect there could be several more. Ministers have ruled out culling them, amid fears of another animal rights backlash after carrying killing badgers as part of efforts to reduce TB in cattle. Defra is now drawing up plans to ‘recapture and rehome’ the beavers, and officials are desperately trying to find a zoo or animal sanctuary willing to give them a home. However, the plan has angered wildlife campaigners, who want the beavers left in their natural habitat to allow them to be properly studied. In comments slipped out in a parliamentary answer, environment minister George Eustice said: ‘We intend to recapture and rehome the wild beavers in Devon and are currently working out plans for the best way to do so. ‘All decisions will be made with the welfare of the beavers in mind. There are no plans to cull beavers.’ Beavers were hunted to extinction in England and Wales during the 12th Century and disappeared from the rest of the UK 400 years later . DEFRA, Natural England and the Animal Health and Veterinary Laboratories Agency are now working on exactly how to catch the animals, and where to send them. In January rare footage emerged of the beavers after a retired scientist used an infrared camera to capture them in their natural habitat. The animal was pictured in a sequence of shots sinking its teeth into a tree. Beavers were once native to England but were hunted to extinction during the reign of Henry VIII in the 16th century. Conservationists have introduced several small groups of beavers back into captivity in the UK, but this is thought to be the first one found living in the wild. Scotland piloted reintroduction of the beaver in 2009 and Wales is considering the issue now. But the decision to rule out allowing the beavers to stay in England has been condemned by countryside groups. An online petition has been set up calling for the beavers to be left alone. Peter Burgess, conservation manager at the Devon Wildlife Trust, said: ‘We would like to see the beavers remain on the River Otter. ‘The one thing we need to make absolutely clear is we do not want to see reintroduction of species happen in this way bit now they are here and on the river, we want them to remain. ‘It is only acceptable if it is proven that they are disease-free, the community need to agree if they want to have these animals on their doorstep. ‘And there needs to be an organisation or affiliated group which has got the responsibility to look after them and learn as much as possible about them. ‘We have got a huge amount to learn about what these beavers could do for us.’ The animalsare living beside the River Otter, in Ottery St Mary, near Exeter, Devon . Experts think the beavers most likely escaped from a private collection, rather than being released deliberately. ‘Beavers are very hard to keep the right side of a fence,’ Mr Burgess said . Derek Gow, a wildlife consultant, also opposed the plan to catch the beavers. ‘At the moment they are ringing all the zoos and asking them if they will take the beavers. ‘What Defra should do is look at a more informative project where by the beavers are left and studied – it becomes an English beaver trial.’ He blamed angling groups for demanding the beavers be removed. ‘Why should three beavers be three beavers too many? ‘This will be the first time in history that we have exterminated a native mammal twice, setting an extraordinary historical precedent.’ A Defra spokesman said: 'We intend to recapture, and rehome these beavers and are currently working out plans for the best way to do so. All decisions will be made with the welfare of the beavers in mind. 'Depending on the source of the animals, they could be carrying a disease not currently present in the UK. In addition, beavers have not been an established part of our wildlife for the last 500 years. Our landscape and habitats have changed since then and we need to assess the impact they could have.'","Ministers draw up plan to 'recapture and rehome' wild beavers .

"By . Richard Spillett . Richard Otunga is accused of murdering his wife Shamin Gabriel by stabbing her 32 times . A jealous Royal Mail worker stabbed his wife 32 times and then called her father round to show him the corpse, the Old Bailey has heard. Richard Otunga, 37, is accused of repeatedly knifing Shamin Gabriel, 33, after confronting her about text messages she was receiving from other men. The court heard Miss Gabriel's father Gabby went to the couple's flat in Northolt, west London, last December and found his daughter lying in a pool of blood on the kitchen floor,. Otunga, who had a history of domestic violence, claimed he 'lost consciousness' during an argument with his wife. The court heard he later told officers: 'I killed her. She was getting text messages from men at work, we both work for Royal Mail. 'We argued and she went to the kitchen and picked up a knife and said she would kill herself, so I took it and killed her.' Prosecutor Timothy Cray told jurors that the attack was 'brutal, unnecessary and beyond any excuse that the law may provide'. He said: 'The allegation against Richard Otunga is that he murdered his wife, a lady called Shamin Gabriel. They married in 2003 and had a daughter in 2005. 'Shortly before 5am on Sunday, 29 December 2013 the defendant made a telephone call to his father-in-law Gabby Gabriel. 'He said that he had argued and fought with Shamin but there were no serious injuries. 'Mr Gabriel, getting a call like that, perhaps like any father would, caught a taxi to Northolt, arriving at 6.40am. 'He found the defendant in the hallway and noted two things - that all the internal doors were closed and that a mobile phone had been smashed into pieces in the hallway.' Ms Gabriel's father found her in a pool of blood in the kitchen of her home in Northolt, west London . He added: 'The defendant told Mr Gabriel that . Shamin had been talking to another man and was always being praised for . her beauty by other men. 'He said that he had lost consciousness and control, that he was very sorry about what he had done and what had happened to Shamin. 'Otunga opened the kitchen door and Mr Gabriel saw that his daughter was lying on the floor. She had been stabbed many times and the kitchen was covered in blood.' Mr Gabriel asked Otunga: 'Is this what you called me for, to show me the body of my daughter?' but Otunga made no reply, repeating that he was 'very sorry', the court heard. The jury heard Otunga later told police officers his wife came at him with a knife and he was trying to defend himself. The postmortem revealed she had been stabbed 32 times. Mr Cray described Otunga as a controlling and possessive husband who regularly checked his wife's phone. 'There had been previous incidents of domestic violence by the defendant,' he said. Otunga admits manslaughter at London's Old Bailey (pictured) but denies murder . 'They show a pattern of controlling and jealous behaviour on his part. 'They also suggest that the fatal attack was not some sudden or unusual event but rather a culmination of violent behaviour on the part of the defendant towards his wife, including previous threats to kill her - he had thought about it before.' Ms Gabriel had repeatedly complained to her family about his jealous behaviour, the court heard. In one allegedly incident in July 2013 Otunga held a knife to her throat and threatened to kill her, Mr Cray said. A few months later he threatened to run the man who was texting his wife over with his car and murder Ms Gabriel as well, it is claimed. Otunga, of Northolt, west London admits manslaughter but denies murder. The trial continues.

"By . Brian Marjoribanks . At Sporting Lisbon's campus in Alcohete, south of the River Tagus, images of Figo and Cristiano Ronaldo decorate the walls. For now, at least, they serve as a reminder that success in football does not always have to be measured in league titles. When Real Madrid's Ronaldo secured his second Ballon d'Or earlier this year, it was the third time since 2000 that the World Player of the Year had been a graduate of the Portuguese club's fabled academy. Of all of Europe's talent factories, only Barcelona's famed La Masia can beat Sporting's record. Yet while the senior side have not won a Primera Liga title since 2002, there was progress last season at the Estadio Jose Alvalade, Sporting's impressive, modern 50,000-capacity stadium.  A second-place finish in the league represented a fair improvement on seventh the previous season. Scroll down to see Gauld's man of the match display for Dundee United . Done deal: Sporting Lisbon and Dundee United have reached an agreement on player Ryan Gauld . Costly: Gauld has a £48m release clause in his Sporting Lisbon contract . Promise: Sporting Lisbon signed talented teenager Gauld from Dundee United on a six-year contract . VIDEO Gauld inspiring Dundee United assisting all four goals . But at a club that so values its own production line, further optimism was to be found in the rise of the new generation of Alcohete academy graduates, continuing the trend set by illustrious predecessors such as Ronaldo, Figo, Joao Moutinho, Nani, Simao Sabrosa and Ricardo Quaresma. Last season, William Carvalho, 22, was Portugal's Player of the Season and Manchester United are currently pondering a £37.5million move. Carlos Mane is merely the latest electric winger in green and white to roll off the Sporting conveyor belt. Another 20-year-old, the versatile Eric Dier, may be English but he has been attached to Sporting since the age of nine and wore the name Eric, rather than Dier, on his back in a nod to his Iberian surroundings. Dier captained each of Sporting's age-group XIs before breaking through, at 19, into the senior side and became a stand-out. Esteemed company then, for young Ryan Gauld, following his stunning £3million move from Dundee United that was finally announced on the Tannadice club's website at 5.30am on Tuesday. According to former Falkirk attacker Pedro Moutinho, there could be no better place for the 18-year-old from Laurencekirk to turn his huge potential into stardom than at a club whose faith in youth has rendered them Portugal's fame academy. Pretender to the throne: Gauld has been nicknamed 'Baby Messi' due to similarities in playing style . Next in line: Gauld will hope to follow in the footsteps of Cristiano Ronaldo at Sporting Lisbon . As a highly-rated Portugal Under-21 player in his early days, Moutinho starred alongside kids with big futures like Paulo Ferreira, later of Porto and Chelsea, and former Stamford Bridge and Juventus star Tiago Mendes. And from 34-year-old Moutinho's local knowledge, the former Maritimo attacker expects Gauld - who was scouted by Aurelio Pereira, the talent spotter who found Ronaldo - to be stuck straight in centre stage from the very minute the new Portuguese season kicks off. 'Just like anywhere, money is tight in Portugal and it's very rare for a team to spend £3million on a teenager,' former SPL striker Moutinho told Sportsmail. 'Sporting would simply not do that then stick him in their feeder team. They will have done their homework thoroughly on Ryan and I think you'll see him at No 10 next season. Sporting will play a 4-3-3 with Ryan just off the striker and I think he will flourish there because, from what I've seen, it's his best position. 'It's a terrific move for Ryan because, at Benfica and Porto, the pressure would be huge. They are massive clubs that win a lot but Sporting haven't won the title for a long time and while they are a huge club, too, expectations are higher elsewhere. 'Not so long ago Sporting had financial problems but they changed their president and last season they did very well, finishing second to reach the Champions League. Their last manager, Leonardo Jardim, left for Monaco at the end of the season and they've brought in a young Portuguese coach, Marco Silva, who is 36. 'Sporting will be looking to improve next season - and they will see Ryan Gauld as a key part of that. He will have a lot of the ball and the time to create. Apart from against the big two, teams will largely be defending against Sporting.  'It's also the perfect club because of the way they develop their young players, both home-grown and bought in. Sporting are renowned as having the best academy in the country, one of the finest in Europe. 'They have a good name after developing players like Figo, Ronaldo and Quaresma. But the development does not stop after the youth team. It continues right up until they sell players.' That brings Moutinho on to the staggering £48m release clause in Gauld's contract with Sporting Lisbon, which could see United quadruple their £3m transfer fee. 'That's a common practice in Portugal, to protect your investment,' said Moutinho. 'If you look at James Rodriguez (Colombia's World Cup star striker), he was brought from Argentina by Porto and sold for £35m (to Monaco), and Axel Witsel of Belgium was brought in (by Benfica) and sold for a similar big fee to Zenit St Petersburg. 'But for each of those success stories, there are players who come in with a clause and then leave for far less, or drop out of the game. I suspect Sporting will have a four-year plan for Ryan to improve him then sell him on for a big profit.  'I don't think Gauld will be the last big export out of Scotland. I work as a coach in the Forth Valley Under-14 academy and I am seeing a huge difference in the quality of local players to when I first arrived in Scotland 10 years ago. 'As a result of clubs having less money, young local players are getting more of a chance and it's definitely for the good of the Scottish game. Ryan's move will also benefit Scottish football because nobody in Portugal knows a lot about Scottish football. But £3m for a Scottish teenager will make everyone sit up and notice. 'It will be hard for Ryan, adjusting to the culture and the language, and when the league kicks off next month it will be roasting hot. But I think Ryan will succeed because he's got the skill and, it seems, the temperament, too. He's a terrific player, very technical.' The last Scot to sign for a Portuguese club was Stephen McPhee when he left Port Vale for Beira Mar in 2004. The Glaswegian, who had spells at St Mirren, Hull City and Blackpool but is now retired, last night warned Gauld to expect a culture shock. But the 33-year-old also believes Gauld's first taste of the Sporting v Benfica derby will remind him of Scotland. 'When any of the big three - Benfica, Sporting and Porto - meet each other, everything grinds to a halt,' McPhee told Sportsmail. 'But the biggest game in the country is Benfica against Sporting because they are both from Lisbon. It is similar to the Rangers v Celtic rivalry. It's fiercely passionate and there are three daily newspapers devoted solely to football. 'It's going to be very different to what Ryan is used to. He will find the training more intense but the lifestyle more laid back. There's never a rush to do anything. 'I remember when I moved over to Beira Mar we were doing morning sessions and going for a sleep and then doing afternoon sessions. 'I thought it was just pre-season training because back home I was used to training in the mornings. But then it continued through the season and I was like, ""what's going on here?"" 'But I learned a lot as a footballer. The game over there is more relaxed, more counter-attack focused. It should improve Ryan's all-round game. 'I didn't get the chance to play at the Alvalade but I did play against Sporting Lisbon at home. They've a great reputation for producing young players - but also for giving young players a chance in their first team. 'My advice to Ryan would be to enjoy the challenge and the opportunity but also try to learn the language. It's something I wish I had put more time into when I was in Portugal. 'I found the whole experience a change in culture but I loved my time there. Sadly, at the end of the season we were relegated and Hull City came in for me. I would have stayed out in Portugal but I didn't fancy playing in the second tier there. 'I hope Ryan does well at Sporting and I wish him all the best on his adventures.'","Ryan Gauld moved to Sporting Lisbon on a six-year contract .

"By . James Chapman . David Cameron has asked Boris Johnson to help ‘reach parts of the electorate other Tories can’t’ in secret talks on the general election campaign. The London Mayor – who yesterday appeared with Darcey Bussell on the South Bank in yet another slightly absurd photo opportunity – is understood to have agreed to play a leading role next year. The two men, seen as the Conservative Party’s biggest rivals, made their peace over lunch at the Prime Minister’s country residence, Chequers. Here goes: Boris Johnson grabs Darcey for a dance on the South Bank in London yesterday . Mr Johnson will focus his campaigning efforts in London, which he has won twice as Mayor in the face of a strong Labour challenge, and in northern marginal seats. He will also target first-time voters, aged between 18 and 22, among whom he is popular, according to party strategists. Mr Johnson has yet to make up his mind about whether to return to Parliament in 2015, as Mr Cameron and Chancellor George Osborne have urged – publicly at least. But his agreement to return to the national political scene, regardless of whether or not he runs for a seat in Westminster, will electrify next year’s election race. One step at a time: Boris copies Darcey Bussell's moves during the photoshoot . Despite their rivalry, Mr Johnson’s skills as a frontman are highly rated by both Mr Cameron and the Tories’ Australian campaign chief Lynton Crosby, who helped him win in London. The Mayor demonstrated his ability to get away with the most unorthodox campaigning techniques yesterday in an appearance with Strictly Come Dancing star Darcey Bussell and a group of Bolivian folk dancers. London Mayor Boris Johnson boards one of the first trains of the new London Overground extension connecting Clapham Junction with Canada Water in December 2012 .

The London Mayor enthusiastically joined in Miss Bussell’s moves on the South Bank to promote an initiative called the Big Dance, which aims to get people fit through dancing. Mr Johnson’s ability to emerge from even the most outlandish photo opportunity with his reputation intact – or even enhanced – is seen as crucial to his appeal by Tory strategists. In their Chequers meeting, thought to have taken place two weekends ago, Mr Cameron and Mr Johnson also agreed that they should make more joint appearances.","London Mayor has 'agreed to play a leading role in the general election'

Tulisa Contostavlos and her assistant Gareth Varey arrive at court today. A celebrity blogger who accused the former X-Factor judge of assaulting him at a music festival has been accused of lying to police about photographic evidence . Mr Morgan told the court today that a picture showing the swollen eye he claims he was given by Contostavlos had existed. But he then went on to say that it had been deleted by Legore, who told him he was worried about his future in the music industry if he went against the 25-year-old star. Miss Contostavlos . is standing trial accused of assault alongside her assistant Gareth . Varey, 28, who is accused of threatening behaviour. The pair, both of north London, deny the charges against them. Her barrister, Jeremy Dein QC, asked Mr Morgan: 'You have misled police throughout regarding the existence of a photo showing injuries to you, haven’t you? That is why Mr Legore has not come forward, because there never was a photograph?' Mr Morgan denied the claim, replying: 'I don’t need to mislead the police about a picture. If there was no photo, I would have said. 'I was honest from the start and I will keep being honest. If you don’t think there was a photo then that’s the end of it.' Savvas Morgan claims the N-Dubz star hit him at the the V-Festival in Essex in August last year . The singer had earlier told the court that Mr Morgan conducted a 'vendetta' against her since an incident in which she asked security to remove him . from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London’s Mayfair. She also said she believed Mr Morgan was  involved in the release of a sex tape of her online. But added that she had no grudge against him, saying: 'He was one of many.' In his closing speech today, prosecutor Matthew McNiff said Contostavlos was a 'good actress' and several witnesses had testified against her. Today Miss Contostavlos's lawyer confronted him over a 'lost' photograph showing his injuries, which Mr Morgan claimed earlier in the trial had been taken after the attack . The singer had earlier told the court that Mr Morgan conducted a 'vendetta' against her since an incident in which she asked security to remove him from a VIP area at the Whisky Mist nightclub in London¿s Mayfair . He said: 'We say that she wanted to deal with Mr Morgan. It was personal, very personal. 'She may regret it but that is something different.' Contostavlos could be seen gently shaking her head at one point during Mr McNiff’s speech. The trial sat for three days in June before being adjourned to today to allow more witnesses to be heard. Mr Dein said Mr Morgan was not a person to be believed, saying there had been a 'sinister' undercurrent about the way he acted, including blogging about 'building a case' against Contostavlos. Mr Morgan was called back to the trial at Chelmsford Magistrates Court after witness Jonathan Shalit made a statement claiming that Royston Gooden Legore, who Mr Morgan says took a picture of his alleged injuries, told him in a phone call that it never existed . He suggested that Mr Morgan made the claim after being publicly 'embarrassed' by the star, potentially damaging his professional reputation. Mr Dein said: 'There is no indication from anyone anywhere that she is a lady disposed to violence or temper. 'The proposition that this can be dismissed on the basis that she is a good actress is not only offensive but contrary to the evidence the court has heard.' Mr Dein also raised 335 abusive comments from readers about Contostavlos under Mr Morgan’s blog posts. Along with a copy of Contostavlos’s well-publicised sex tape, they were removed from the website only after the singer obtained a court order, the trial heard. Mr Dein also questioned the reliability of prosecution witnesses, several of whom were friends of Mr Morgan. The singer will face a fifth day in court and a wait of three weeks to find out her fate after the judge adjourned the hearing after a day lengthened by extensive legal argument. He will hand down his verdict at Stratford Magistrates' Court in east London on July 25. The trial continues.

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . Ed Miliband was ridiculed today for spending his teens campaigning for Britain to leave Europe. The Labour leader delivered leaflets in the 1983 general election campaign, in which left-wing leader Michael Foot vowed to withdraw the UK from the European Community. David Cameron joked about it being ‘his idea of fun’ as a Tory MP claimed it was ‘strange’ that Mr Miliband now opposes holding an in-out referendum on Britain’s membership of the EU. Labour leader Ed Miliband was mocked in the Commons for delivering leaflets in the 1983 election campaign as a teenager which called for Britain to leave the European Community. Pressure has mounted on Mr Miliband, with the Unite union warning denying people a chance to vote on Britain's membership of the EU would be an ‘electoral millstone’. Mr Cameron has promised to claw powers back from Brussels before staging an in-out referendum before the end of 2017. But Labour has refused to match the pledge, with senior figures privately admitting that being pro-Europe is one of the party’s few policies which business likes. Mr Miliband has said he would only allow a referendum if more powers are transferred from Westminster to Brussels during the next Parliament – something which even Labour figures admit is highly unlikely. In the Commons today, Tory MP Tony Baldry recalled how as a 13-year-old boy Mr Miliband had campaigned for Mr Foot in the 1983 general election. According to a biography  by Mehdi Hasan and James Macintyre, Mr Miliband joined the Labour party as a teenager and accompanied his father Ralph in campaigning for Mr Foot ahead of the 1983 general election. At Prime Minister's Questions today, Mr Baldry said: ‘In the ‘83 general election, a 13-year-old boy delivered leaflets around my constituency pledging that Michael Foot would take Labour out of the European Union. Ed Balls and Ed Miliband in the Commons today . Having to listen to Ed Balls every day would be a 'miserable existence', David Cameron claimed today. In an extraordinary attack on the shadow chancellor, Mr Cameron said spending time with Mr Balls was not his idea of fun. The remarks came as Mr Cameron teased Ed Miliband for spending his teens delivering leaflets for the Labour party. Asked by Mr Balls what the Prime Minister's idea of fun was, Mr Cameron replied: 'It is not hanging out with the shadow chancellor. That is not my idea of fun. 'So I feel sorry for the leader of the Opposition because he has to hang out with him all of the time. 'What a miserable existence it must be to have sitting next to you the person who wrecks the British economy and have to listen to them day after day, day after day, as they say to the British people ""We are the people who crashed the car, give us the keys back"".' ‘Do you find it strange that that same boy - now leader of the Labour Party - isn't willing either to support the re-negotiation of Britain's terms of membership of the EU or to pledge to support to trust the people of Britain in a referendum on our membership of Europe?’ To raucous laughter, Mr Cameron appeared to come to the defence of the young Miliband. ‘I’ve always thought it is terribly unfair to hold against people things they might have done in their youth,’ the Prime Minister said. ‘Really… if, as a 14-year-old that was his idea of fun then obviously, you know, we have to make room for everybody.' He insisted that it is 'in the interests of the British people' to have a renegotiation before a referendum. Tory MP Bob Neill is to try to force an in-out referendum into law using a backbench bill. Conservative ministers will be forced to support the law, but Labour has refused to support it. But the Unite union, which has given Labour £12million since Mr Miliband became leader, warned the party risks being ‘boxed in’ without addressing the European issue. Unite general secretary Len McCluskey told the union's national conference in Liverpool that staying silent on the EU left the field open for Ukip and others to 'exploit' people's concerns to win votes. He said Unite believed that the advantages of EU membership outweighed the disadvantages, especially in terms of social protections and supporting manufacturing investment. Mr McCluskey said: 'This issue has bedevilled British politics for decades. For much of that time it has been the Tories who have had to deal with divisions in their ranks over Europe. 'But the next general election will be different. Both Ukip and the Tories will be offering a referendum on the issue of Britain's membership. As things stand, Labour won't, because ducking this question is seen as part of Labour's commitment to business. 'That is a vast hostage to fortune. I would not like to be Ed Miliband explaining why he is not joining other parties in offering the British people a vote on something that is clearly a growing source of public concern. 'It is time that Labour's leadership took a new look at the referendum question. We do not seek a referendum to take Britain out of the EU, we seek a referendum rethink in order to help Labour into power. 'Without such a pledge, our party will stand exposed, Ukip will be strengthened in some key constituencies and the Tories will hypocritically charge Labour with being anti-democratic. In a tight election, this can make the difference.' Prime Minister David Cameron it is 'in the interests of the British people' to have a renegotiation before a referendum . Mr McCluskey said denying a referendum would suggest that Labour was part of a 'political elite' that did not trust the electorate. Delegates at the conference approved a statement from Unite's executive urging Labour to 'urgently reconsider' its approach to a referendum, and making it clear that the union would argue for a vote for Britain to stay in the EU. In the 1983 Labour manifesto – dubbed the longest suicide note in history – Mr Foot pledged: ‘British withdrawal from the Community is the right policy for Britain - to be completed well within the lifetime of the parliament. That is our commitment. ‘But we are also committed to bring about withdrawal in an amicable and orderly way, so that we do not prejudice employment or the prospect of increased political and economic co-operation with the whole of Europe.’","Miliband delivered leaflets for Michael Foot in 1983, the Commons is told .

"Brazilian playmaker Kaka set his sights on helping football become the No 1 sport in America after signing for the newly-formed Orlando City. The 32-year-old said the American League could exploit the interest created by the United States' memorable run at the World Cup in Brazil. 'My expectation is that soccer is going to be the first sport in America,' Kaka said on Wednesday, adding that he wanted to help the MLS become one of the five biggest leagues in the world and attract more international players. Hero's welcome: Kaka is mobbed by Orlando City fans after arriving at the international airport . Where's the band? Kaka's arrival has been likened to that of a rockstar by the club . American boy: Kaka walks through the airport wearing an Orlando City scarf . 'In Europe the players speak a lot to come to play in America,' Kaka said. 'To other players I think I can show that the American league is a nice place to play.' Kaka and team owner Flavio Augusto da Silva repeatedly cited as a deciding factor in his move the seriousness of the Orlando City franchise's vision as a global brand capable of attracting international talent to a growing US market. Orlando City have refused to reveal the salary of Kaka, the 2007 world player of the year award and the team's first designated player. MLS allows three high-priced designated players per team for whom only a portion of their salaries are included in the cap. 'Yes, they're paying me good. I had to say this. But I had another opportunity to earn more than they are paying me here. So my decision is not about money,' Kaka said.

Despite talks with Orlando over the past year, Kaka said he made his decision only recently to leave AC Milan where he spent seven years and had another year remaining on his contract. 'I always think about long-term projects ... I hope I can stay here in Orlando for a long while,' Kaka said. Da Silva posted on Facebook that the contract is for three years. At 32, Kaka, an attacking midfielder, said the timing was right for him. 'This is the right moment for me because I'm not too old and not too young but I have the experience to come and give a lot of things to the league,' Kaka said. Da Silva said the team has other unnamed players in mind. Club president and owner Phil Rawlins said new players must fit the distinctive style of play of the three-year-old Orlando City minor league team which he described as very open and high scoring. Kaka will play on loan through the end of 2014 for his home club Sao Paulo.","Kaka is leaving AC Milan following mutual termination of his contract .

Cheteshwar Pujara demonstrated his well-being for next week's first Test as India recovered well from early losses on day two of their final warm-up match against Derbyshire. Two wickets in five balls for Mark Turner and first-team debutant Ben Cotton left India 18 for two, in reply to 326 for five declared at the County Ground. But a characteristically unhurried Pujara (81) gradually took control in stands of 63 with Virat Kohli and then 119 with Mahendra Singh Dhoni in a teatime 217 for five. Nice knock! Cheteshwar Pujara scored 81 to save India from a batting embarrassment against Derbyshire . Unflustered: Pujara was in characteristically unhurried style as the tourists warm-up for the England series . The tourists appeared to show their hand for the five-Test Investec series against England, with no place for Gautam Gambhir in the top six. Turner was significantly the most experienced of the home seam attack on the middle day here, and he was the first wicket-taker too - trapping Murali Vijay (six) lbw on the back foot. Turner's new-ball partner Cotton made an impressive start and was rewarded in a spell of 8-4-6-1 with the wicket of India's other opener Shikhar Dhawan - who pushed forward and edged behind to also exit for six. It took Kohli 10 balls to get off the mark, with a single to cover off Cotton. India's poster boy had a moment of concern on 18 when - in the first over from Greg Cork, teenage son of former England bowler Dominic - he edged low but marginally short of Chesney Hughes at slip. There were no further concerns as India's third-wicket pair closed out the session, but Kohli did not last long in the afternoon. Helping hand: MS Dhoni engineered a century partnership with the man of the day at the County Ground . Twenty-year-old Cotton, back for more, struck again and bagged a highly-prized scalp too as Kohli (36) tried to leave a tight line but instead chopped the ball down on to off-stump. Dhoni surprisingly promoted himself to number five, to good effect, as his unorthodox attack proved an ideal complement to Pujara. The India number three's tried-and-trusted method is to take few risks and wait for bowlers to tire.Cotton duly did so as, having bowled 11 overs for eight runs, he conceded three off-side fours in his 12th to Pujara - who brought up his 98-ball half-century soon afterwards. Dhoni (46) took one liberty too many with David Wainwright, who deceived the India captain in the flight to bowl him leg-stump on the charge. Pujara then promptly retired himself out, for the second match in succession after doing so for 57 at Leicester - leaving Ravindra Jadeja and Stuart Binny to push for a first-innings lead.","England face India in the first Test on Wednesday in Nottingham .

"By . Martha Kelner . Follow @@marthakelner . Eugenie Bouchard is the new sweetheart of SW19, and with the biggest names in the women’s game falling quicker than sales of Saltires outside Wimbledon station, she is taking centre stage. The Canadian swats away opponents with a firecracker forehand on the court and charms away from the lawns with a ready wit on subjects ranging from the Royal Family to what makes her blood boil. The two collided on Wednesday when she was forced to wait for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge before taking apart quarter-final opponent Angelique Kerber. Match point: Eugenie Bouchard beat Angelique Kerber in straight sets on Wednesday . Up and coming: She is into her third successive semi-final at a Grand Slam . Royal appointment: Bouchard revealed how players were made to wait for Royals to take their seats . Love match: William and Kate, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, enjoyed watching play on Centre Court .

So we were just waiting, and then suddenly  William and Kate walk by to go on Centre Court,’ she recounted. ‘It was funny because we actually walked to our court late because Kate and William used that hallway.  It’s funny how Wimbledon does it. Waiting for people usually makes me angry as I’m an impatient person —particularly when I’m waiting for family members for dinner — but I was OK to wait that one time.’ There are not many people  to whom Bouchard is happy to play second fiddle, as Kerber soon discovered. With their blonde hair in neat plaits and both wearing matching white visors, it was as though they had co-ordinated their outfits. But when it came down to business, Bouchard smashed her mirror image, leaping on to the German’s woefully weak second serve and putting away overhead volleys like a prize fighter delivering a knockout punch. On form: The Canadian celebreates taking the first set on day nine at SW19 . Hammer blow: Kerber fights hard but is eventually broken in the first set . The 20-year-old Canadian is no flash in the pan. Her relatively straightforward 6-3, 6-4 victory over Kerber, No 9 in the world and a former semi-finalist here, takes her into the top 10 for the first time. Bouchard is the only player to reach the semi-finals of all three Grand Slams this year and No 3 seed Simona Halep today stands in the way of a spot in Saturday’s final. They are the two most consistent players on the women’s tour with 15 wins at this year’s majors. Halep crushed Sabine Lisicki, last year’s beaten finalist, 6-4, 6-0 on Centre Court, partly owing to the German’s incredible implosion. Lisicki fell apart from 4-1 up in the first set, losing 11 games in a row. Halep smelt blood and ripped her to shreds. Bouchard has fallen at this hurdle in the Australian Open and Roland Garros but is determined to go further this time. As evidence of her determination, she has eschewed sightseeing trips with her mother Julie Leclair and brother William. ‘I don’t want to waste energy and get distracted,’ she said. ‘My mum and brother have gone visiting quite a bit. They went to Windsor Castle, the Parliament, all these things, while I’m practising or playing matches. Maybe I’ll do that after the tournament or next year. It’s something I do when I lose early, so I hope to not do it at all.’ Bouchard was named after  Princess Eugenie, and her twin  sister, who was named after  Princess Beatrice, attends university in Canada. ‘She is my own Princess Beatrice,’ said Bouchard. ‘We are opposite but very close. It’s interesting, because I think her normal university life is really cool because I don’t do it and I’m a huge  supporter of her. I get on her about her grades and things like that.’ Power: Bouchard strikes through the ball in the first match on Court No 1 on Wednesday . A TV view: Genie serves in the distance of a ball girl on Wednesday afternoon . If Bouchard was being assessed at Wimbledon, she would be  getting straight As so far. While her one-time idol Maria Sharapova and world No 1 Serena Williams have fallen by the wayside,  Bouchard is yet to drop a set. Just two years ago she was  winning the junior girls’ title here and this is only her sixth Grand Slam, but it is indicative of her self-belief that she is not really  surprised at her surge up the rankings. ‘I felt last year that I belonged here so I don’t think it is surprising,’ she said. ‘I’ve played for 15 years now. I’ve put in a lot of hard work. So, results that come for me, in the back of my mind I expected them because I’ve put in so much time and effort. ‘I decided I was going to be a professional player at nine years old and the more I played I really had concrete dreams of winning a Grand Slam.’ Bouchard quickly dismissed a light-hearted suggestion that she might follow Greg Rusedski in switching allegiance from Canada to England, but the flag sellers outside the station might consider stocking more Maple Leaf flags for the remainder of the tournament.","Bouchard wins 6-3, 6-4 on Court No 1 at Wimbledon on Wednesday .

The 25-year-old Brazilian made just 25 appearances for Spurs in an injury hit campaign last season but he has attracted interest from Rafa Benitez's side. The former Chelsea and Liverpool boss sees Sandro as the perfect midfield addition to help Napoli build on their third place finish in Serie A last season. Wanted: But Sandro's price tag of £20million could price Napoli out of any deal . While new Spurs coach Mauricio Pochettino is not keen on letting the Brazilian leave, the club would listen to bids starting at the £20million mark. Napoli president Aurelio De Laurentiis seems unlikely to offer that kind of money though which could see Sandro extend his four-year stay at White Hart Lane.

The ghost van was caught in action at the Alison Road and Botany Street intersection at Randwick on video by Lee Henderson who uploaded the footage on YouTube. In the 22-second video, which so far has attracted more than 300 views, the van cuts in front of a motorbike while travelling down Alison Rd. Scroll down for video . About a week ago a white van - that seemed to have no driver - interrupted traffic at a busy Randwick intersection, in Sydney's inner city . The van rolled backwards across five lanes of traffic . As it passes in front of camera lens, no-one is spotted driving the white van as it makes its way from one side of the road to the other. A pedestrian crossing the road appears unfazed by the incident while the motorcyclist continues watching it as it crosses their path. The van is finally stopped after it runs into at least one car parked on Alison Rd. It is believed the incident happened about a week ago. A 22-second video uploaded to YouTube shows the 'ghost van' in action . Bizarrely, the traffic interruption was not been reported to New South Wales Police. A police spokesman said enquiries to eastern Local Command Area stations had turned up no reports of the ghost van. He said it was believed no one was injured during the incident.

"By . Louise Cheer . An Australian businessman has been charged with attempted fraud in New Zealand after he allegedly tried to rort $22 million from insurance company IAG by falsely claiming two submersibles. Corey Hinds, 24, appeared in Manukau District Court - south of Auckland - on Tuesday and did not enter into a plea, The New Zealand Herald reported. New Zealand police arrested the businessman - who heads submersibles manufacturer Hinds Systems Limited - at Auckland Airport on the same day after returning from an interview with IAG in Australia. Corey Hinds - whose company makes the pictured submersible - allegedly tried to falsely claim $22 million for two of them from an insurance company . In May, Hinds reported two of his remote-controlled submersibles - made exclusively by his company - were stolen. Each were insured for $11 million. But later police found them concealed at a rural property in Coromandel - west of Auckland - and charged Hinds with attempted fraud. Stuff.co.nz reported court documents listed Hinds' address as in Caboolture - north of Brisbane - in Queensland. The Hinds Systems Limited website said the submersibles were built in New Zealand and were designed by Shane Corsen of Corsen Manufacturing. The submersibles are made of carbon fibre and are 'fairly undetectable' when underwater and was sought after by the United States Navy, according to the site. 'It can live in the ocean for up to three hundred days, down to one thousand metres, while it scans and photographs its environment,' it said. The website also described Hinds as 'an exceptionally talented man with an entrepreneurial flair'.

"By . Jonathan O'Callaghan . American Science and Engineering (AS&E) has revealed its portable X-ray detection system that can be used by security enforcement on the go. Dubbed the Mini Z, the Massachusetts-based company said the handheld device can be used for fast, real-time detection of potential threats inside objects such as backpacks, tyres and more. The device reveals the interior of its target on a screen using backscatter technology, which detects radiation that reflects from a target. Scroll down for video . Massachusetts-based AS&E have unveiled their Z Backscatter X-ray scanner called the Mini Z. It will retail for £30,000 ($50,000) and is apparently able to detect potential threats in locations other scanners cannot reach, such as airplane seats and in bags at events . The Mini Z, which costs £30,000 ($50,000), can detect a range of ‘hidden organic threats’ according to AS&E. Length: 11.5 in (29.2 cm) Width: 9.8 in (24.9 cm) Height: 7.6 in (19.3 cm) Weight: 9 lbs (4 kg) Operating Time: 4 hrs per battery charge . Scan Speed: 6 in (15 cm) per second (typical) Ambient Operating Temperature: 0°C to 45°C (32°F to 113°F) Screen: Windows 8.1 Tablet PC . These include drugs, explosives and even plastic guns that would otherwise be missed by more 'traditional' X-ray systems. They also claim it is the world’s first handheld Z Backscatter handheld imaging system. The device works by having a single-sided imager on the front. When the user presses a button on the top it begins scanning in front of it and procures a real-time image of the target on a tablet, which acts as the screen. This can spot materials that more traditional systems such as transmission X-ray can miss including explosives, currency, and drugs. The system also does not require any set-up and can be used immediately. And, the company added, the system is safe for operators, bystanders and the environment because the X-ray dose is within radiation safety standards, although it is not designed to scan people. ‘Leveraging the breakthrough capabilities of our Z Backscatter detection technology, the Mini Z system is AS&E's initial offering of what will be a family of portable backscatter products,’ said Chuck Dougherty, AS&E's President and CEO. When the user presses a button on the top, it begins scanning items and procures a real-time image of the target on a tablet, which acts as the screen (demonstration shown). This can spot materials that more traditional systems such as transmission X-ray can miss such as explosives, currency and drugs . The device reveals the interior of its target on a screen using backscatter technology, which detects radiation that reflects from a target. And, the company adds, the system is safe for operators, bystanders and the environment.  The X-ray dose is within radiation safety standards . The product is a miniaturisation of the technology used in the Z Backscatter Van [ZBV] already manufactured by the company, which is used to scan much larger objects like trucks and containers. This, said Dougherty, makes it ‘more affordable and accessible to a broader range of customers.’ He adds: ‘The Mini Z system is a game-changer for law enforcement and border security officials who are constantly challenged to quickly and accurately detect potential threats in hard-to-reach environments as they work to ensure the highest level of public safety.’ Such hard-to-reach places include vehicle bumpers, tyres, panels and interiors at border and security checkpoints. It can also be used to scan hand baggage at events, perform security sweeps of meeting rooms and inspect the seats of planes for hidden contraband.","Massachusetts-based company has revealed its portable X-ray scanner .

"By . Victoria Woollaston . Imagine a home where if you asked your thermostat to change temperature it would, or one that could text your neighbours if an alarm went off while you were on holiday. These scenarios are all now a reality after Google-owned thermostat firm Nest opened up its software for developers to use for the first time. It means that other companies will now be able to take advantage of the smart thermostat’s software - which can be controlled remotely. Nest has opened up its software for third-party developers to use for the first time so that companies will now . be able to take advantage of the smart thermostat's (pictured) software - which can be controlled remotely . Nest Labs was formed in 2011, but earlier this year was purchased by Google for $3.2 billion (£1.8 billion). Co-founders Tony Fadell and Matt Rodgers had both previously worked at Apple, including on the iPod and original iPhone. The company has two central products so far - a smart thermostat that can be controlled via a mobile device, and an alarm system that also monitors carbon monoxide levels. The announcement confirmed the first partners have linked up with Nest to use Google voice recognition and the phrase ‘OK Google’ in order to verbally change temperature on the thermostat. Rodgers, vice president of engineering at Nest, said: ‘The Nest Learning Thermostat and Nest Protect alarm are already helping people save energy, stay comfortable and improve home safety - but that’s only the beginning. The smart LiFx lights (pictured left) were funded by a Kickstarter campaign. They start at $89 . (£53) each and an individual light can be customised to be any colour on . the spectrum using an app (right). When connected to the Nest alarm, the smart light bulbs can be used to warn of carbon monoxide leaks, for example . Qualcomm presented its vision for a connected home at Mobile World Congress in February, and showed how almost anything in the home can be controlled by a smartphone or linked together electronically. From smartlocks and security lights to fridges, all the devices in its conceptual dwelling are sold by individual companies, but all of them run AllJoyn software. AllJoyn is an open source project set up by chipmaker Qualcomm in 2011. It is a programme that can be added to smart devices to make them ‘talk’ to other devices running AllJoyn. The company has since partnered with a number of companies that have developed smart household devices to help develop the software further. For example, an August smartlock can be linked to lights that flash if they sense an intruder, using the system. ‘Our goal has always been to bring this kind of thoughtfulness to the rest of your home and life - and that’s what the Nest Developer Programme is all about. ‘To kick off the programme, we’ve worked with iconic brands like Mercedes-Benz and Whirlpool, as well as new industry leaders like Jawbone and LiFx, to build seamless, secure and practical ‘Works with Nest’ experiences for the home.’ The Mercedes-Benz set-up will enable a car to send a message when a driver begins their journey home so the thermostat can start heating or cooling accordingly, in time for their arrival. The Jawbone activity monitor wristband communicates with Nest to set the temperature as a person wakes up and it can do this because the Jawbone UP24 wristband tracks a wearer's sleep. ‘We’re trying to invent experiences you’ll use everyday with products that you’ll use everyday’, said Rodgers. ‘We want to build an experience, not something just for the sake of it.’ The Mercedes-Benz set-up will enable a car (pictured) to send a message when a driver begins their journey home so their thermostat can start heating or cooling accordingly . The Jawbone wristband and sleep monitor (pictured) communicates with Nest to set the temperature as a person wakes up . Nest said that more than 5,000 developers have already registered an interest in working with the software, including light bulb manufacturer LiFx, which has developed a system to turn the internal lighting of your home red should the Nest carbon monoxide monitor detect a leak. Phil Bosua, founder and chief executive of LiFx, said: ‘When we first heard about the Nest Developer Programme, we knew we wanted to be a part of it. ‘Nest brings a whole other dimension to LiFx. Who would have thought by combining Nest products and LiFx products, we could help save lives?’ The launch will further fuel talk of a movement towards the ‘internet of things’ - an ever-growing idea that soon all of the devices we use will be connected together, much like computers when using the web. Technology giant Samsung has confirmed in the past that the company believes that this trend will be the key development of the next decade in the technology sector, with UK president Andy Griffiths saying he believes the future is all about the ‘connected home’. Chipmaker Qualcomm has also unveiled a concept of the connected home where its AllJoyn software connects various smart devices from smartlocks and security lights to the fridge and TV. AllJoyn works in a similar way to Works with Nest, by making it possible for smart gadgets from various manufacturers to 'talk' to each other, however, AllJoyn doesn't need a single product at its centre to function, like Nest does.","Nest has already partnered with Mercedes-Benz, Whirlpool and Jawbone .

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . Archaeologists have discovered a set of 25 well-preserved Inca quipus, an ancient string device thought to be used for record-keeping. The discovery was made in the ruins of Incahuasi, just south of Lima, among ancient warehouses known as kallancas. The 600-year-old strings reveal just how advanced the Inca civilisation became, despite not having a known written language of its own. A set of twenty-five well-preserved quipus (pictured) were found in the archaeological complex of Incahuasi, south of Lima. The 600-year-old strings reveal just how advanced the Inca civilisation became, despite not having a known written language of its own . Quipu - also called 'khipus' or 'talking knots' – are made up of coloured spun thread, and sometimes, strings from llama or alpaca hair. As they weren’t uncovered in a funeral context, as is the case with other quipus, researchers believe that these may have been used for administrative purposes, according to a report in Peru This Week. The belief is they helped in record-keeping, when authorities wanted to monitor items such as tax, military strategy or the population’s health. A quipu has one main cord, called a primary cord, from which a number of other pendant cords hang. Quipu - also called 'khipus' or 'talking knots' – are made up of coloured spun thread, and sometimes, strings from llama or alpaca hair. A quipu has one main cord, called a primary cord, from which a number of other pendant cords hang . The Inca Empire stretched from Ecuador through central Chile, with its centre in Cuzco, a city in the southern Peru. The Incas called their empire Tawantinsuyu, the 'Land of the Four Corners,' and its official language was Quechua. When the Spanish conquered the Inca in 1532, they were a small ethnic group based in Cusco. Despite their short rule, they controlled more than 12 million from 100 different cultures and speaking at least 20 languages. To support this empire, a system of roads stretched for almost 25,000 miles (40,000 km), which is around three times the diameter of the Earth. While the Inca did not develop a formal system of writing, they did use  devices such as the quipu. Researchers today are unable to read them, but they believe they would have been used for creating records such as a census. Attached to these pendant cords are up to 12 additional cords, which are called subsidiaries. Each quipu cord may have several knots, which researchers believe the Incan empire used as a decimal system of counting. The knot type, researchers believe, may indicate the magnitude of a number in units of one, 10, 100 or more. Their positions and colours likely revealed what was being counted such as gold, corn, or other products. Incahuasi, where the latest discovery was made, was one of the most important strategic cities built by the Incas in the valley of Lunahuana. Their empire stretched from Ecuador through central Chile, with its centre in Cuzco, a city in the southern Peru. There are currently around 600 khipus held in museums and private collections throughout the world which date from 1400 – 1532 CE. Many quipus were destroyed by the Spanish conquistadors in the 16th century, making this recent find all the more significant.

"By . Ellie Zolfagharifard . The Hey Joe mug can keep a freshly-brewed coffee at exactly the right temperature . Bleary-eyed workers up and down the country know the power of a freshly-brewed cup of coffee to get them through the start of the week. Now, to prevent queues of drowsy people lining coffee shop pavements, a group of Atlanta-based entrepreneurs has developed a device that can brew coffee on the go. Not only that, but the system prepares the coffee to exactly the right temperature helping to prevent accidental burns as exhausted workers rush to get their caffeine fix. This 0.9lb (408g) ‘Hey Joe’ device makes the coffee using small 30p (50 cents) pods that are placed into a tray at the bottom of the mug. Water is poured into the upper compartment at any temperature where it is warmed by a battery-operated heating plate. Once the water reaches a certain temperature, it drips onto the pod and fills the bottom reservoir with coffee. The hot plate continues to regulate the temperature based on a user’s preference. One push of the button will see coffee . brewed at 60°C (140° F), two pushes heats the coffee up to 68° C (155° . F), while three pushes will prepare and serve a cold drip coffee. ‘We believe it is better to heat coffee up . to the exact right temperature from the beginning rather than try to . cool it down after the fact,’ co-found Jordan Warren wrote on the mug's website. Scroll down for video . For non-coffee drinks, the mug (pictured) can also brew tea. A USB connection recharges the mug, and this will need to be done every three brews . This 0.9 lb (408 g) ‘Hey Joe’ device makes the coffee using small 30p (50 cents) pods (pictured) that are placed into a small tray at the bottom of the mug. The process takes a minute and a half for a cold drip, and around three minutes for hot, depending on how much liquid goes into the system. ‘Because your coffee is kept in a separate tray and encased by a coffee pod, there is little to no residue and it is only in the tray itself,’ said Warren. The Hey Joe mug, which is currently in the middle of a Kickstarter campaign, can brew 0.4 litres of coffee in one go. The team even made their pods out of biodegradable material with flowers seeds weaved into the fabric. Once the water reaches a certain temperature, it drips onto the pod and fills the bottom reservoir with coffee. The hot plate continues to regulate the temperature based on a user’s preference . For non-coffee drinks, the mug can also brew tea. A USB connection recharges the mug, and this will need to be done every three brews. ‘Whether you're a working professional or a student, there is nothing worse than taking a sip from your travel thermos, only to find the coffee is lukewarm or cold,’ said Mr Warren. ‘Now there is a travel-sized coffee mug that can brew your coffee for you anytime, anywhere to the perfect drinking temperature.’ A pledge of £29 ($49) on Kickstarter will get you the mug, while (£40) $69 will also send 40 pods of Hey Joe coffee. The team hopes to begin shipping in November this year. Health-related gadgets are all the rage these days, from smart wristbands to apps that track what you consume. But a new device from San Francisco-based Mark One, called Vessyl, claims to be able to streamline the process by putting all the technology you need in a cup. The product can accurately identify your drink, tell you how many calories you are consuming, let you know how hydrated you are, and alert you when it’s time to drink again. Under the surface is the computing power that givers the device its ‘smart’ functionality - although how it works exactly is being kept a closely-guarded secret by makers Mark One. The technology enables the cup to recognise what liquid is poured inside from a catalogue of thousands. It knows the content and make-up of the drink, and is therefore able to let you know exactly what you are putting into your body. The cup can then be asked to display a particular set of data to aid you achieve certain goals, such as losing weight or regulating caffeine.","The ‘Hey Joe’ device makes coffee using small 30p (50 cents) pods .

"A two-metre stingray weighing more than 100 kilograms has been set free after being trapped for four days in a rock pool south of Sydney. The large female was released on Wednesday following alleged attempts to gas and even spear the stingray by members of the public to get the animal out of the North Cronulla pool which she became trapped in on Saturday. Manly Sea Life Sanctuary staff organised the 45-minute rescue, with help from Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and Sutherland Shire Council lifeguards. Trapping the stingray in the net only took about 10 minutes at the North Cronulla rock pool . The stingray was at least 100kg with six people struggling to lift the animal onto the rock pool edge . The stingray was too large to swim back over the ledge without assistance from the rescuers . Manly Sea Life sciences manager Rob Townsend told MailOnline that although he had conducted similar rescues of stingrays in a rock pool, none had been as large as this one. ‘It would have to be at least 100 kilos because six of us struggled to lift her,’ he said. The team tried to persuade the creature to swim over the edge of the pool but after numerous attempts it seemed she was too large for the task. 'She was too big to manipulate herself to swim over,' Mr Townsend explained. The only option left was to capture the stingray in a big net and take over to the pool’s edge. It was alleged that members of the public attempted to gas and even spear the large female during the four days before she was freed . Manly Sea Life Sanctuary staff organised the 45-minute rescue, with help from Sea Life Sydney Aquarium and Sutherland Shire Council lifeguards . The stringray needed encouragement by the rescue team to swim off the rock platform . 'We waited for large waves and floated her over the crest of the wave,' he said . Mr Townsend said it took another 5-10 minutes to persuade the stingray to swim off the rock platform. 'We had to stand in her way if she was heading in the wrong direction to encourage her to swim further because they have sophisticated sensory organs,' he said. He heard that there were attempts from members of the public to gas, and even spear the stingray during the four days before she was freed. 'It's not protected species so people are perfectly well within their rights to chop it up for flake although the action is questionable,' he said.

"By . Australian Associated Press . A babysitter killed a toddler she was supposed to be caring for five years before the two year old's body was found buried beneath a house, a coroner has ruled. Mandy Martyn tied Daniel to his bed, locked him in cupboards, gagged and beat him and held his head under water during six weeks of torture in the lead-up to his death, Victorian coroner Jacinta Heffey ruled. Daniel Thomas's mother Donna was also implicated in the tragic case for not doing enough to protect the boy in the Victorian town of Myrtleford, northeast of Melbourne. Scroll down for video . Donna Thomas has been blamed by a coroner for not doing enough to protect her son Daniel, who was found buried under a house five years after he went missing . The two-year-old died on or about October 13, 2003, from the abuse suffered at the hands of his babysitter Ms Martyn, Ms Heffey said. 'His death was caused by Mandy Martyn, who inflicted the injuries that led to his death,' she told the Victorian Coroners Court on Thursday. 'Donna Thomas contributed to his death by her inaction and her failure to protect her son.' Ms Thomas wept in Victorian Coroners Court on Thursday as Ms Heffey delivered her findings . She and Daniel moved into Ms Martyn's Myrtleford home about six weeks before he died, and throughout the period, Daniel was subjected to horrific abuse, Ms Heffey said. 'Daniel was exposed to cruelty amounting to torture,' she said in her findings. Ms Heffey said Ms Thomas failed her son by remaining in the home and allowing the abuse to continue. 'She remained under the same roof as someone who systematically mistreated her own son and she manifestly failed to protect or console him,' she said. 'She chose to do nothing and allow the abuse to Daniel to continue.' Ms Heffey found Daniel's death was possibly caused by strangulation, drowning or a head injury but did not make a ruling on a specific cause. A coroner has blamed Donna Thomas for her role in Daniel Thomas's death in 2003. She has not been charged. Police have never charged a killer but Detective Senior Sergeant Stuart Bailey told reporters after the discovery of Daniel's body the investigation was ongoing. Daniel's father, Kevin Ruffels, hugged family members after the finding was delivered. After the hearing Mr Ruffels said he had always blamed Martyn, who has never been charged over the the boy's death more than a decade ago. 'She was obviously the one all along we thought was the main suspect so I hope she goes to hell,' he said outside court. 'There's no closure until Mandy gets her right whack, she gets charged hopefully, and sentenced to many years in prison.' Mr Ruffels said he was shocked Donna Thomas was also named as a contributor to Daniel's death. Daniel was reported missing by Martyn in October 2003. His remains were found in 2008, buried under the Myrtleford home where he and his mother had previously lived. Ms Martyn was not in court and was excused from giving evidence at the inquest. Kevin Ruffels told Martyn to 'go to hell' after she was named by a coroner as the woman responsible for his son's death .
