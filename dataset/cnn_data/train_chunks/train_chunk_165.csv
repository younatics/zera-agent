"(CNN)  -- Vice President Joe Biden announced Wednesday that a deal has been reached with hospitals to help fund health care reform. Vice President Biden says ""we can't wait"" for health care reform. ""We're here today to make our health care system healthy again,"" Biden said in announcing the agreement. Biden said the hospital industry has pledged to contribute $155 billion in Medicare and Medicaid savings in the next decade. ""Hospitals have acknowledged that significant health care savings can be achieved by improving efficiencies, realigning incentives to emphasize quality care instead of quantity of procedures,"" Biden said. ""In the last several weeks, they've been working with [Senate Finance Committee] Chairman [Max] Baucus and are coming forward with a proposal that produces real savings in federal health care spending. Savings that will be applied toward the president's firm goal ... of enacting health care reform that is deficit neutral."" As the health care system becomes more efficient through technology and innovation, Biden said, increases in Medicare and Medicaid payments to hospital will slow and, as more people are insured, hospitals will bear less of the financial burden in caring for those without adequate coverage. ""Today's announcement, I believe, represents the essential role hospitals play in making reform a reality. And the reality will be we must enact this reform this year,"" Biden said. ""We must, and we will, enact reform by the end of August, and we can't wait."" Biden was joined by Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and representatives of the hospital industry. The hospital deal follows Obama's announcement last month of an agreement reached with the nation's pharmaceutical industry to cut drug costs for elderly Americans, calling it an example of the kind of compromise required for successful national health care reform. That agreement discounts medications for Medicare beneficiaries facing high out-of-pocket expenses when their benefits reach a gap in coverage. Following Biden's announcement, House Minority Leader John Boehner accused the administration and Democrats of ""bullying health care groups into cutting backroom deals to fund a government takeover of health care."" ""Democrats, Republicans, and health care stakeholders must work together on real reform to give Americans better access to affordable health care, but that's not happening in Washington,"" Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. ""It's time for Washington Democrats to abandon their 'go it alone' approach and work with Republicans on true reform that expands Americans' access to affordable health care,"" he said.","Deal with hospital industry will lead to $155 billion in savings, Biden says .

"Washington (CNN) -- I am pretty sure I met the next leader of the conservative movement during a three-day confab of activists that wrapped up Saturday here in the nation's capital. I definitely shook hands with a future congressman or maybe even a governor. Maybe it was the 14-year-old conservative wonder-kid Jonathan Krohn, who champions ""conservatism based on reality"" and was a prominent speaker at the Conservative Political Action Conference. Seriously, 14 years old and he is talking about ""conservatism based on reality."" He has even written a book about it: ""Defining Conservatism."" When I was 14, I was trying to learn how to hit a fastball. If you follow baseball, you know that spring training has started in Arizona and Florida, and I am writing this column from Washington. Oh well. I wonder if Krohn can hit a fastball? Perhaps it was the 18-year-old freshman from Wake Forest University, the 27-year-old senior from Goucher College, or the 24-year-old recent graduate of Bridgewater College who now helps conservative and libertarian students maintain their rights on largely liberal college campuses. Without a question, it was the youth, the next generation of conservatives, who emerged from the CPAC meeting as the Big Winner. The American Conservative Union, which put on this exhaustive three-day program, estimates that more than 10,000 people attended and 60 to 70 percent were under the age of 30. It was like Spring Break for College Republicans. I even got a bottle opener and a keg cup from the College Republican booth. The slogan on the bottle opener: ""The Best Party on Campus."" Full coverage of CPAC meeting on CNN political ticker . The future looks bright, or at the very least, there is hope in the future for the conservative movement. But unlike in my household, it wasn't all about the kids. There were other winners and losers in my mind, so I thought I would share them with you. Winner: Ron Paul Revolution . Texas Rep. Ron Paul was the overwhelming choice of attendees to be the 2012 Republican presidential nominee in the nonscientific, yet much discussed, CPAC Straw Poll. Paul's supporters were out in force each day of the conference, handing out leaflets and emphasizing the Texas congressman's disdain for the Federal Reserve. He received huge applause during his late Friday afternoon speech, but when he was announced as the winner of the Straw Poll the audience erupted in boos. Why? Well, let's take a look at a loser. Loser: CPAC straw poll . Admittedly, for political junkies like me, you can be tempted to put too much emphasis on a straw poll. But when there is a chance to survey 10,000 -- that's right, 10,000 -- political activists, it is hard not to get a little excited to see the results. Alas, that is not what happened this weekend. Sure, there were 10,000 attendees, but only 2,395 participated in this unscientific survey. You do the math. Not quite the snapshot I was looking for. What we learned this past weekend -- OK, we already knew it -- is that Paul has a very loyal following. The Texas congressman has already proven that he can run a national campaign, but can he win the Republican presidential nomination? I'm not sure all of his views resonate with GOP primary voters. But I have to admit, I will be there again next year when the results are announced. Winner: Marco Rubio . He was the belle of the ball at CPAC. The former Florida House speaker was praised for challenging Gov. Charlie Crist, who is popular with the party establishment, for the Republican Senate nomination and refusing to bow to pressure to abandon his bid. Rubio kicked off the conference with a speech that hit all of the boilerplate conservative themes, which drew the audience to its feet several times. Rubio's wisest move was placing a form soliciting volunteers and donations on every seat in the ballroom before people took their seats. Loser: Sarah Palin . A tough decision to tag the former Alaska governor with this brand, but CPAC was her crowd and she wasn't present. Will it hurt her politically? No. But she missed out on an opportunity to appear before a very large and very friendly audience. Instead, she allowed a half dozen or so other potential candidates the opportunity to try to convince attendees they have the best chance of defeating President Obama in 2012, without ever having to explicitly say it. And there is no doubt in my mind, the adults who forked out $750 for the all-inclusive three-day pass and students who paid $25 for the conference would have bought another copy of Palin's book, even if they already had one on their bedside table. Winner: Newt Gingrich . The former House speaker entered the CPAC conference from a distant door up a staircase, halfway across the cavernous room from the podium. The ""Rocky"" anthem, ""Eye of the Tiger,"" bellowed from the sound system as Gingrich made his way through the electrified crowd. It was almost one of those ""Wow!"" moments. Definitely memorable. Winner: Rick Santorum . The former Pennsylvania senator is being singled out for his decision to shake it up a little bit during his speech. How did he do it? Simply. Santorum delivered an abbreviated speech and then took questions from the audience. He didn't exactly have the best time slot, Saturday at 8:30 a.m. Even I was bleary-eyed. Yet the former Pennsylvania senator had a pretty good showing and offered up a mea culpa to the attendees for supporting Sen. Arlen Specter's re-election in 2004. Longtime Republican Specter switched to the Democratic Party last year. And Santorum didn't dance around the fact that he is considering a White House bid. Loser: Social conservatives . This still influential wing of the conservative movement was well represented at CPAC this year, but the immediacy of some of their top issues -- abortion, same-sex marriage and ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" in the military -- just wasn't a major part of the larger discussion. Instead, these activists were primarily talking about fiscal discipline, lower taxes and limited government. And GOProud, a gay conservative organization, was one of the cosponsors of CPAC. Winner: Republican Party . There has been much speculation that Tea Party activists will actually hurt the Republican Party because this new, decentralized political movement will field candidates to run in the midterm elections. A third-party conservative candidate introduced into a race will actually help the Democrats, because it will split the Republican vote. Remember the New York special congressional election won by a Democrat in 2009, because of a third-party conservative candidate? While that may happen on a scattered basis in 2010, there was widespread acknowledgment that this is not in the conservative movement's best interests. These activists want to see conservative candidates such as Rubio run in the primaries, but come November, I don't think you are going to see a slew of formidable third-party candidates. Winner: Democratic Party . Huh? What? Are you crazy? Well, I am definitely a little crazy, but this was an easy call. Why? Democrats got to see firsthand that conservatives are no longer lying flat on their backs after what was then thought to be a knockout blow that Obama delivered in the 2008 elections.","Young conservatives were big winner at weekend confab, says CNN's Mark Preston .

"(CNN) -- Travelers are getting back on the move Wednesday, a day after heavy snowfall caused cancellations and delays across much of northern Europe. Eurostar, the high-speed passenger rail service that connects London, Paris, Brussels and other cities, resumed a limited schedule on Wednesday. Journey times will be about two hours longer than usual on the trains that are running, the company said. ""Disruption on the high-speed line continues, and we anticipate speed restrictions remaining in place throughout the day,"" a statement on its website said. Eurostar has urged passengers not to travel Wednesday unless their journey is essential, saying they can request an exchange or refund. Eurostar services on Thursday will also be affected by continuing freezing conditions, the company said. Eight trains are already canceled, while others may take up to an hour longer than usual to reach their destination. Almost all Eurostar services were canceled Tuesday because of snow, ice and high winds, affecting around 10,000 passengers. French train operator SNCF said it had put up more than 1,000 customers in hotel rooms near train stations overnight and had made sleeper cabins available on some trains. Motorists in northern France have also been badly affected by the snow and black ice, including many in the capital, Paris. ""The situation is particularly difficult at the moment with so many trucks stuck on the road, we must respect that this is the information we have and it is not easy,"" French Interior Minister Manuel Valls told BFM-TV. ""We are working very hard to relieve the situation and to help the people who are currently stuck."" Some 2,000 stranded motorists had to be given shelter overnight, an Interior Ministry statement said. Emergency workers have given food and drink to others who chose to stay in their vehicles. Nearly 34,700 homes in northern France were without electricity on Wednesday, down from 80,000 as of Tuesday evening, the ministry said. Flights backlog . All four runways are in operation Wednesday at Germany's Frankfurt Airport -- a major European hub -- but about 100 flights will be canceled over the course of the day. The situation is easing but the backlog of canceled flights has to be reduced, spokesman Dieter Hulick told CNN. The airport canceled 800 of a total 1,238 flights on Tuesday as it grappled with heavy, drifting snow that closed all four runways for several hours. Cots were put up in the airport overnight for stranded passengers, Hulick said. Travel was also disrupted by heavy snowfall in Moscow on Wednesday morning, with some flights delayed and roads gridlocked. Worse weather is forecast for the Russian capital in the coming days. Gusting wind . Late-winter blasts like these are nothing new for central Europe, according to CNN meteorologist Brandon Miller. In fact, Germany refers to it as Marzwinter, or ""March winter,"" Miller said. The phenomenon occurs in mid-March when, after a period of spring-like warmth early in the month that often coaxes trees and flowers to begin to bloom, cold northerly winds bring mid-winter type weather back to the country. True to form, last week there were seven consecutive days of above-average temperatures in Frankfurt. The mercury peaked Saturday with a high of 17 degrees Celsius (about 62 degrees Fahrenheit), the kind of temperature usually expected in mid-May. On Tuesday, however, winter returned with a vengeance, dropping 12 centimeters (4.7 inches) of snow on the city by noon. In addition to the snow, winds have gusted to 50 and 60 kph (31 to 37 mph), creating whiteout conditions and making travel even more difficult. Northern France took the brunt of the storm, with some locations seeing up to 40 centimeters (nearly 16 inches) of snow. Gusty winds have created snow drifts a meter deep or more in places. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: Disruption to Eurostar trains will continue into Thursday, the operator says .

"Washington (CNN) -- Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, indicated Wednesday that the GOP-controlled House of Representatives will not back a resolution sponsored by Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, expressing congressional support for limited American involvement in the NATO-led military campaign in Libya. ""I don't think that's where the House is,"" Boehner told reporters on Capitol Hill.  ""The fact is the president has not made his case to the members of Congress.  He has not made his case to the American people."" McCain's resolution, introduced Tuesday along with Massachusetts Democrat John Kerry, authorizes the commitment of U.S. forces for one year while stressing the lack of support for any use of American ground troops. McCain, the GOP's 2008 presidential nominee, said Tuesday he believes President Obama ""did the right thing by intervening (in Libya) to stop a looming humanitarian disaster."" House leaders are preparing to hold a vote on the McCain-Kerry measure, but are also considering another resolution that would strictly limit U.S. involvement in Libya to a noncombat role. House Republicans will meet behind closed doors Wednesday afternoon to discuss the issue. The allied military effort, which already has formal United Nations support, was launched to protect Libyan civilians from violence stemming from a crackdown launched by the North African country's longtime ruler, Moammar Gadhafi.  Western leaders have made clear, however, that they believe the mission cannot be successfully completed without Gadhafi's ouster. The Obama administration has already promised not to use U.S. ground troops, but bipartisan congressional opposition to the military campaign has been mounting. An unusual coalition has formed between traditionally anti-war Democrats and conservative Republicans worried about the cost of the conflict and skeptical of its national security importance. Support for the war has also been shaken by evidence presented by Gadhafi's government of several noncombatant deaths caused by recent NATO airstrikes.  NATO officials admitted over the weekend that aircraft from countries in the alliance had mistakenly struck vehicles aligned with the Libyan opposition. In addition, critics contend the administration has violated the 1973 War Powers Resolution, which gives the president 60 days to get congressional approval for sending U.S. forces to war, followed by a 30-day extension to end hostilities.  The combined 90-day period ended Sunday. The White House argues the president didn't need congressional authorization because U.S. forces are playing only a supporting role in Libya and haven't engaged in what the law defines as hostilities. Obama, however, personally overruled contrary legal opinions put forward by both the Pentagon and the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, according to a Saturday report in The New York Times. Boehner indicated Tuesday the House proposal seeking to limit U.S. forces to a noncombat role reflects growing frustration over Obama's alleged failure to inadequately consult Congress. ""If the commander-in-chief believes that intervention in Libya is important for our national security, he has a responsibility to make a case for it -- clearly and publicly -- and seek authorization,"" the speaker said in a written statement. ""In the three months since military action in Libya began, none of this has occurred. ... Congress has a responsibility to hold the White House accountable."" In the Senate, however, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, have resisted holding a vote on the war because of divisions within their respective caucuses. Reid said Tuesday that there is bipartisan support for the McCain-Kerry resolution in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, but that he was still in discussion with the two sponsors on when to bring the measure from the panel to the Senate floor. He indicated it could be brought to the floor as early as this week. McConnell, meanwhile, told reporters that ""we all anticipate that there will be some kind of Libya debate in the Senate in the near future."" McCain has expressed anger that the White House didn't push for an earlier congressional vote on the war. The veteran senator, considered a leading voice on military matters, contends that a resolution of support would have passed easily when NATO first intervened. ""The administration's disregard for the elected representatives of the American people on this matter has been troubling and counterproductive,"" McCain said Tuesday. ""The unfortunate result of this failure of leadership is plain to see in the full-scale revolt ... that is occurring in the House of Representatives."" The House is also planning to take up the 2012 defense spending bill later this week, and liberal Rep. Dennis Kucinich, D-Ohio, intends to propose an amendment cutting off funding for the mission. However, that amendment is likely to only come up next month after the House returns from its Fourth of July recess. To prevent a similar resolution from Kucinich from passing earlier, Boehner pushed through a resolution giving the president two weeks to send Congress information justifying the U.S. strategy in Libya. Obama responded with a 32-page report arguing in part that he has not violated the War Powers Resolution. Even if the Republican-controlled House passes measures intended to limit funding for the Libya mission, it is unlikely the Senate would do the same. ""The president's done a lousy job of communicating and managing our involvement in Libya, but I will be no part of an effort to defund Libya or to try to cut off our efforts to bring Gadhafi down,"" conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told NBC's ""Meet the Press"" on Sunday. Obama ""needs to step up his game with Libya, but Congress should sort of shut up and not empower Gadhafi,"" Graham argued. In March, the Senate unanimously passed a nonbinding resolution supporting the no-fly zone over Libya. Some Republicans, however, have now expressed opposition to that effort, citing growing concerns about its cost. In its report on the mission, the administration said the cost of military and humanitarian operations through June 3 was about $800 million. It estimated the total cost through September 30 would be $1.1 billion. Questions about the war's financial and other costs have also been raised in the United Kingdom, which has played a leading role in the NATO effort. British Prime Minister David Cameron insists that Britain's military involvement in the North African country can continue ""as long as we need."" CNN's Dana Bash, Deirdre Walsh, Dan Lothian, Alan Silverleib and Tom Cohen contributed to this report.","NEW: Speaker Boehner says the House won't back the McCain/Kerry resolution .

"WASHINGTON (CNN) -- Washington lobbyist Vicki Iseman has dropped her libel suit against The New York Times, the paper announced Thursday. Lobbyist Vicki Iseman has dropped her libel suit against The New York Times. The Times said the paper did not retract the article and that the lawsuit was settled without payment. Instead, the paper will allow Iseman's lawyers to ""give their views on the suit"" on the paper's Web site. The lawyers wrote that the negotiation process with the newspaper was ""rational"" and led to ""a civilized resolution."" The defamation suit contended that the Times improperly suggested in a lengthy February 2008 article that Iseman had begun an affair with John McCain in 1999, before McCain undertook his first presidential run. Iseman's lawyers also said the article implied that she unethically profited from her relationship with McCain. McCain and his advisers used the article and its use of unnamed sources to blast the Times as biased against the then-presidential candidate as he cruised to the Republican nomination. The two sides issued a joint statement on the paper's Web site stating that ""Ms. Iseman has accepted The Times' explanation, which will appear in a Note to Readers to be published in the newspaper on Feb. 20, that the article did not state, and The Times did not intend to conclude, that Ms. Iseman had engaged in a romantic affair with Senator McCain or an unethical relationship on behalf of her clients in breach of the public trust.""

"Washington (CNN) -- A formal investiture ceremony will take place Friday for Elena Kagan during a special sitting of the Supreme Court. Kagan was sworn in as the 112th justice of the court in August. The 2 p.m. event on Friday is a formal affair where the authority of the office is conferred. The Senate confirmed Kagan 63-37 on August 5 on a mostly party-line vote. She joins a closely divided court that often splits in favor of a shaky 5-4 conservative majority. Despite no judicial record to draw clues on the kind of justice she would become, White House officials had quietly assured allies Kagan would be a ""reliable"" liberal vote similar to John Paul Stevens, whom Kagan replaces on the bench. She is, therefore, not expected to tilt the current ideological balance on the high court. Among the cases she will confront in her first term will be disputes over noisy protests at military funerals, state bans on violent video games and the death penalty. High-profile appeals that may reach the court in the next couple of years include Arizona's sweeping immigration reform law; California's ban on same-sex marriage; and a challenge to health care mandates passed by Congress this spring.

"(CNN) -- With a contentious runoff election less than three weeks away, a Peruvian presidential candidate is hitting the campaign trail with former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani at her side. Wearing an American-flag lapel pin, Giuliani stood behind candidate Keiko Fujimori as she spoke to reporters this week about her proposed security program for Peru. ""We have invited Mr. Giuliani so that he strengthens this program, so that he gives us ideas about how we can better fight crime,"" Fujimori said. Giuliani's proposals for Peru include building more jails and creating a system to better track crime statistics, she said. Fujimori praised Giuliani's tough stance on crime and his track record turning around New York City, signaling that Giuliani would be her security adviser if she wins the June 5 presidential election, Peruvian state media reported. On Tuesday Fujimori's running mate denied Giuliani's presence was part of the campaign's electoral strategy, saying that the former New York mayor came to Peru this week because of ""scheduling reasons."" ""It has not exactly been a strategy that he come now, but at any rate it has been lucky, because, yes, I think it has been at a good time,"" vice presidential candidate Rafael Rey said in a statement posted on the campaign's website. Fujimori is a former congresswoman and the daughter of former President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year sentence for human-rights abuses. In a 2008 interview, she said she wouldn't hesitate to grant her father amnesty because she believes he is innocent. She has since backed away from those remarks. In the June 5 runoff election, she faces nationalist Ollanta Humala, who garnered more votes in the first round of elections last month. Critics describe the leftist Humala as a close ally of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez. Humala, who lost in the second round of the 2006 elections, has said that he has matured and become more moderate since then. Giuliani's Peruvian trip this week isn't his first consulting visit to Latin America. He has also advised Mexico City's police force and spoken about his ""zero tolerance"" crime policies to law enforcement in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.","Candidate Keiko Fujimori praises Giuliani's track record in New York City .

"Washington (CNN) -- President Barack Obama's longtime legal mentor and current administration adviser has admitted privately telling him that Justice Sonia Sotomayor was ""not nearly as smart as she seems to think she is."" Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe's comment was in a letter to Obama in May 2009, when Sotomayor was being considered for the Supreme Court appointment that later came to her. Tribe ""bluntly"" suggested Sotomayor would have a ""negative impact"" on the court because her ""reputation as something of a bully"" -- on her previous appeals court seat -- ""could well make her liberal impulses backfire."" As a result, he concluded in his letter, the Bronx native would have little influence to move the court away from its current conservative majority, led by Chief Justice John Roberts. Tribe also managed to criticize three sitting justices and offer negative comments on top finalists being considered at the time for the high court seat. The confidential letter was obtained and revealed Thursday by conservative legal activist Ed Whelan, who writes the Bench Memos blog for National Review Online. Tribe then confirmed the contents. Tribe, who was an influential professor at Harvard Law School, made clear the purpose of his letter -- written on Harvard stationary -- was to promote the candidacy of Elena Kagan, who had been Tribe's boss as dean at the law school. ""I can't think of anyone nearly as strong as Elena Kagan, whose combination of intellectual brilliance and political skill would make her a ten-strike,"" wrote Tribe, making a bowling reference. The president ultimately rejected Tribe's advice, choosing Sotomayor three weeks after the letter was written. Sotomayor, the first Hispanic justice, is beginning her second year on the high court after replacing the retired David Souter. Kagan was nominated in May of this year to take the Supreme Court seat of John Paul Stevens. It is not known what specific influence Tribe had on persuading the White House to choose her. The two are longtime friends, beginning when Kagan was a research assistant for the professor in the mid-1980s. Both left Harvard last year to take jobs in the Obama Justice Department -- Kagan as solicitor general and Tribe as a special adviser. Roberts also has a connection to Tribe; he was a former student of the professor. Sources close to the selection process have said Tribe was intimately, if indirectly, involved in screening candidates for the 2009 and 2010 high court vacancies. He had been a longtime booster of Kagan, so his comments in the letter are not surprising. What is unusual is the candid, often dismissive remarks he offered for various other candidates, and the fact the 69-year-old academic chose to put it all in writing. In a statement e-mailed late Thursday, Tribe sought to clarify his earlier critiques. ""Reservations I expressed about Justice Sotomayor prior to her appointment were amply refuted by the closer study I was later able to give her record and that have been fully negated by her performance as a justice,"" Tribe said. On Chicago-based federal appeals Judge Diane Wood, who administration sources have said came very close to being chosen over Kagan -- Tribe said she was ""more powerful intellectually than Sonia Sotomayor or any of the others mentioned as plausible prospects at the moment with the sole exception of Kagan."" But he said Wood at age 60 was a decade older than Kagan and lacked a ""dynamic personality or the extraordinary diplomatic gifts for inspiring confidence"" that he believed Kagan possessed. The professor said Michigan Gov. Jennifer Granholm would be a ""dramatic appointment,"" despite having no judicial experience and being born in Canada. And Kathleen Sullivan, former dean at Stanford Law School and a private attorney, ""might be worth fighting for,"" he said. Tribe also found room to praise the retiring Souter, and offered his analysis of the current court, which he said was dominated by Justice Anthony Kennedy, who often is the deciding, ""swing"" vote in key cases. Tribe said Kennedy is ""formalistic"" in his legal thinking, and he tweaked Justice Antonin Scalia's conservative doctrine. The most blunt criticism was aimed at left-leaning Justice Stephen Breyer, whom Tribe said had a pragmatism that was comparatively ""mushy and constrained"" in its approach to law and justice. ""I think it's clear that a Justice Kagan would be a much more formidable match for Justice Scalia than Justice Breyer has been,"" Tribe concluded. In his new statement, Tribe said he has ""long held"" Breyer and Kennedy in the ""highest regard."" Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathy Arberg said neither Kagan nor Sotomayor had any response to the controversy. The White House on Friday emphasized the qualifications of both jurists and Obama's confidence in their service on the bench. Whelan suggested in his blog that Tribe may have promoted Kagan's candidacy out of loyalty over a 2004 incident when she was his boss at Harvard Law School. Tribe admitted his 1985 book ""God Save This Honorable Court"" had lifted large sections verbatim from a similar 1974 work by Henry J. Abraham, without giving proper credit. After an internal investigation, Kagan reprimanded the professor for ""a significant lapse in proper academic practice"" but concluded that Tribe's error was unintentional. He kept his job. Tribe has written other legal books on constitutional issues, and has served as a private appellate attorney on several high-profile cases, including representing Al Gore during the 2000 election dispute. Tribe concluded his 2009 letter to Obama with effusive praise. ""I can hardly contain my enthusiasm at your first hundred days,"" he told his former student. ""I continue to hope that I can before too long come to play a more direct role"" in the president's administration. Shortly thereafter, Tribe was made ""senior counselor for access to justice"" in the Justice Department, tasked with increasing legal access for the poor. He has called Obama ""the best student I ever had.""","Constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe said Sotomayor could have a ""negative impact""

"(CNN) -- The sharp attacks between the Republican frontrunners that have played out in media interviews and television ads largely took a backseat in the debate in Sioux City, Iowa. It was the final debate before January's pivotal Iowa caucuses. Here are five things we learned from Thursday night's debate: . Front-runners play nice . In the past week, there has been no love lost between GOP frontrunners Mitt Romney and Newt Gingrich. On Tuesday, Romney called for Gingrich to return all the money he received for consulting for Freddie Mac, and Gingrich responded by telling reporters in New Hampshire that Romney should return all the money he earned ""bankrupting companies and laying off employees over his years"" at Bain Capital. Most recently, Romney's campaign sent Iowa Republicans a mailer featuring a half-page picture of Gingrich seated next to liberal Democrat Nancy Pelosi. But little of that enmity was visible on stage in Sioux City. Who do you think won the debate? ""I've said consistently, these are all friends of mine,"" Gingrich said, referencing his rivals on stage. ""Any of these folks would be better than Barack Obama in the White House. Any of them would be great in the next administration."" ""Let's every day remember that, time and time again, it's President Obama we've got to be talking about,"" Romney said at the end of the debate, and for the most part he stuck to his pledge. Even when directly asked to respond to a Gingrich attack, Romney immediately pivoted to focus on Obama. Gingrich 'editing' words as campaign acknowledges concern . Perhaps Romney was responding to Gingrich's recent call for a positive campaign, but after the debate Romney's senior strategist Eric Fehrnstrom did not rule out future attacks. ""He has to win a primary against six or seven other candidates and so he's going to differentiate and distinguish himself from his competitors from time to time,"" Fehrnstrom said. ""We're getting closer to the first contest and I think as that happens the campaign becomes more intense and more competitive on the part of every candidate."" Paul leaps outside mainstream . Despite a recent surge in the polls and a growing base of support among early-state voters, Ron Paul showed that he's still out of step with the Republican mainstream on one major issue: foreign policy. Paul could rock GOP race in Iowa . Fox News anchor Bret Baier kicked off the second hour of debate by asking Paul if his non-interventionist position toward Iran means that if he got the nomination he'd be running to the left of President Obama. ""But I'd be running with the American people, because it would be a much better policy,"" Paul said. He then cited the United Nations and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper to argue that there is no evidence that Iran is even close to developing a nuclear weapon. ""It's no different than it was in 2003,"" Paul said. ""You know what I really fear about what's happening here? It's another Iraq coming. There's war propaganda going on. To me, the greatest danger is that we will have a president that will overreact and we will soon bomb Iran."" Even when Baier pushed him to respond to a hypothetical situation where he ""had solid intelligence as President Paul"" that Iran was close to building a nuclear weapon, the congressman stood firm. No matter the circumstances, Paul said he would remove all economic sanctions currently in place against Iran, even going so far as to compliment Obama for his handling of the situation -- virtual apostasy in a GOP debate. ""I think he is wisely backing off on the sanctions,"" Paul said, warning of the effects sanctions on Iran could have on Europe. ""Sanctions are an act of war when you prevent goods and services from going into a country. We need to approach this a little differently. We have 12,000 diplomats in our services. We ought to use a little bit of diplomacy once in a while."" Paul is no stranger to going out on a limb, and although he received a smattering of applause for his principled stance, he found no agreement from his rivals on the stage. In fact, one of the largest cheers of the night came after when Michele Bachmann called his position ""dangerous."" So while Paul is finding traction with a growing section of libertarian-leaning Republicans, his approach to foreign policy may still be a little too hard-line for a majority of primary voters. Bachmann goes on the offense . Michele Bachmann has been hovering in the bottom-tier ever since her Iowa straw poll win in August, but she held her own on the stage in Sioux City and may have even fared better than many of her competitors. She had the sharpest attack lines of the night against frontrunner Gingrich: ""You don't need to be within the technical definition of being a lobbyist to still be influence-peddling with senior Republicans in Washington, D.C., to get them to do your bidding."" The Minnesota congresswoman also drew applause when she challenged Ron Paul's position on Iran. ""I think I have never heard a more dangerous answer for American security than the one that we just heard from Ron Paul,"" Bachmann said. CNN's Truth Squad . Gingrich dressed Bachmann down for challenging his work with mortgage giant Freddie Mac, saying people like her ""ought to have facts before they make wild allegations."" Bachmann quickly deflected the criticism and charged back at the frontrunner. ""I think it's outrageous to continue to say over and over through the debate that I don't have my facts right when as a matter of fact I do,"" Bachmann said. ""I'm a serious candidate for president of the United States. And my facts are accurate."" But if Bachmann still feels the need to proclaim her seriousness at this point in the race, Iowa voters may have similar concerns. Perry peaks at right time? If only Rick Perry had begun like this. The Texas governor delivered a forceful performance in a state where he hopes to reinvigorate his struggling campaign, including delivering perhaps the line of the night when he said he might just defy expectations and become the ""Tim Tebow of the Iowa caucuses."" Just like for Tebow and his fluky mechanics, expectations for Perry in this debate were certainly low. But he was warmly received by the audience on topics ranging from dismissing Attorney General Eric Holder to establishing a part-time Congress to defending the border from illegal entrants -- an issue Perry has worked to turn into a rhetorical strength. ""I've been dealing with this issue for 11 years,"" he said of sealing the Texas-Mexico border. ""I've sent Texas Ranger recon teams there. Our law enforcement men and women face fire from across the border or in the U.S. side from these drug cartels. It is not safe there. Our country is at jeopardy."" At one point Perry, the politician with a history of verbal slips, even corrected moderator Baier when he misattributed a quote to Ronald Reagan. If Iowa voters were impressed by Perry's performance, his rapid improvement as a debater may just come in time to make a difference on January 3. Huntsman left his heart in New Hampshire . Jon Huntsman made a rare trip to Iowa to participate in the debate, but his answers seemed directed more to the socially moderate and Independent voters who populate his adopted state of New Hampshire. The former Utah governor emphasized his conservative credentials on the economy, including instituting a flat tax in his home state and his ""limited government, pro-growth"" philosophy. Asked about the United Nations -- traditionally a punching bag for Republicans -- Huntsman said ""it serves a useful purpose in the area of peacekeeping."" On a question about environmental concerns overruling energy production, Huntsman called it ""a delicate balance,"" and espoused natural gas as one part of the solution. And in case anybody didn't get the message, at one point Huntsman told his colleagues on the stage: ""You don't need to pander,"" he said. ""We need to be who we are.""","Newt Gingrich: ""I've said consistently, these are all friends of mine""

"Washington (CNN) -- With Herman Cain's departure from the 2012 field of candidates seeking the Republican presidential nomination, several contenders have sought to claim the ""tea party candidate"" mantle. But for those entrenched in the movement, none of the remaining candidates have a legitimate claim to the title. Minnesota Rep. Michele Bachmann founded the tea party caucus in the House in 2010 and was designated one of the top 10 most conservative members of the chamber by Heritage Action, sister organization to the Heritage Foundation, an esteemed conservative think tank. She declared the tea party would ""come home"" to her campaign the day after Cain suspended his bid for the White House earlier this month. But Bachmann must jockey with other candidates for that title. Texas Rep. Ron Paul claimed the tea party was started with his 2008 presidential campaign. He first ran for Congress in 1976 with the platform of Constitution-based policy. Twelve terms later, Paul has announced he will retire after serving. His philosophy jibes with the tea party value of crafting policy close to constitutional standards. Ron Paul: I'm the 'flavor of the decade' Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich has also entered the fray of tea party-professing candidates, with some help from across the aisle. The Democratic National Committee released an ad painting Gingrich as the ""original tea partier."" With a balanced budget on his resume, achieved during President Clinton's second term, Gingrich has embraced the tea party movement from its beginning in 2009. So which of the three actually fit the mold? ""I don't think anybody has a claim to that title,"" said Mark Meckler, co-founder and national coordinator of the Tea Party Patriots. ""What we're looking for is for all candidates to try their best to articulate and reflect tea party values, and I think that we've been very successful in pushing the debate so that they're all required to do so,"" Meckler said. Tea Party Express chairman Amy Kremer agreed. ""I don't think that there's any one candidate that can say that they're the real tea party (candidate),"" she said. Neither the Tea Party Patriots nor the Tea Party Express have endorsed a candidate from the field of seven, which includes Bachmann, Paul, Gingrich, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, Texas Gov. Rick Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney. Judson Phillips, founder and CEO of the Tea Party Nation, endorsed Gingrich in September, but no candidate has yet received the bulk of party support. Christine O'Donnell, a former Senate candidate from Delaware and a tea party darling, endorsed Romney on Tuesday and decried tea partiers who have been ""flocking"" to Gingrich's campaign. Romney has been both panned and praised within the tea party movement, but when it comes to conservative chops, Meckler and Kramer say Bachmann, Paul and Gingrich all have something to boast about. Meckler described Bachmann and Paul as having long-term records that are ""consistent"" with tea party values, but cautioned that the tea party caucus founded by Bachmann was assembled with the understanding that ""they didn't speak for us, they didn't have any influence over us,"" and ""they don't represent us."" Instead, Meckler says the caucus was intended as a ""listening mechanism, not a representative mechanism."" Bachmann has only picked up three endorsements from the caucus, but Kremer said that shouldn't have bearing on the way tea party supporters vote. ""While I respect the tea party caucus and a lot of those members that are a part of that Congress, the American people don't want a congressman or congresswoman or a senator to tell them that they should vote for a certain person,"" she said. Kremer touted Bachmann's ""loud voice for the tea party dating back to the early days of the movement,"" but she balked at Paul's credentials. ""I never knew who Ron Paul was before this tea party movement started,"" she said. Kremer stated the longtime congressman hasn't been involved with the Tea Party Express and cited his absence during the bus tour leading up to the CNN/Tea Party Republican Presidential Debate in September. ""I think it's interesting that they claim that he's the godfather of the tea party movement, but yet he doesn't interact with the tea party movement whatsoever,"" she said. Conversely, for Kremer, Gingrich can be credited with a long, tea party history. ""The other interesting candidate out there is Newt Gingrich because (he) has been involved in the tea party movement from the very beginning,"" she said, crediting his organization American Solutions as being one of the original sponsoring organizations of the 2009 Tax Day Tea Party and his staff members with reaching out to work with tea party groups across the country. ""With Newt, one of the things that people like is that he was able to balance the budget when President Clinton was in office... He understands the importance of the conservative moment,"" Kremer said. ""He's been building that relationship."" But CNN contributor and conservative columnist Rich Galen questions whether there is a tea party to be the candidate of. ""Those kinds of groups need enemies to be successful. They need to have someone they can point to, rail against and raise money to defeat. Then, when you win, you're out of enemies so the vigor of the organization tends to dissipate, if not the organization itself,"" he said. ""To that degree, that's what has happened to the tea party."" An NBC News/Wall Street Journal survey released earlier this week indicated that 27% of Republican primary voters nationwide consider themselves tea party supporters -- up two percentage points from November -- but 65% say they do not. Galen noted 2010 U.S. Senate losses of tea party backed candidates O'Donnell in Delaware and Sharron Angle in Nevada as lessons for the movement that prove endorsements may be too risky to gamble. ""They went out of their way to nominate somebody that they liked and ended up losing the seat,"" he said. ""Presidential politics in America is different than any other level â€” the president is our version of royalty. It's a far different and more thoughtful, more consuming thought as to who you're going to vote for for president."" But tea party-backed candidates also posted big wins -- including four seats in the Senate, the governor's mansion in South Carolina and seats in the House. Admitting that she'd thought the Tea Party Express would have made an endorsement by now, Kremer credited the volatility of the GOP race as a reason it has not and suggested efforts may be better directed elsewhere. ""I thought we would've made (an endorsement) by Iowa, but the movement really needs to coalesce behind somebody before we get involved,"" she said. ""And because everybody is all over the place, I think it's smart to focus on the U.S. Senate, because regardless of if [President Barack] Obama is re-elected or not, we need to have control of that Senate."" The movement has not solidified around one candidate, due in part to the diversity of its supporters and an awareness that electability is a critical factor in securing the GOP nomination. Kremer acknowledged it ""could be an issue."" ""These people in this movement, it's not like they're a bunch of idiots out there holding up signs and protesting the government. These people are doing their research... and they're making their decisions based upon what they're learning."" The NBC News/WSJ poll found that while 40% of GOP primary voters back Gingrich compared with 23% who back Romney, in a hypothetical general election matchup, Obama would defeat the former House speaker 51%-40%. Romney comes closer, trailing 47%-45%. Paul placed third, but received 9% support and hasn't cracked the top two in national polls since announcing his candidacy. And although Bachmann won the critical Ames straw poll in Iowa in August, she placed fourth in the survey and has consistently received single digit support. Gingrich and Romney may top polls measuring national support for the Republican candidates, but Meckler hesitated in speculating on whether the nomination will be duked out between the two. ""Trying to make these kinds of predictions is foolhardy,"" he said. Kremer stated Romney still has bigger problems to face. ""The thing that he's going to have to reconcile with this grassroots movement is that at the end of the day, people don't want a mandate for health care. It doesn't matter if it's a state mandate, they don't want a mandate coming from state or federal government,"" alluding to the health care plan Romney ushered in as Massachusetts' governor. Both Kremer and Meckler are confident that, despite heavy-handed criticism of both frontrunners, the tea party movement will mobilize behind any candidate that is the nominee and prioritize Obama's defeat over tea party ideals. When asked whether tea party stalwarts will resist voting for a GOP nominee not in line with their values, Meckler said, ""There certainly may be some that will do that (but) I don't think that's the majority of people in the movement."" ""There are very few people that have said that there's no one that they can support,"" Kremer said. ""Gingrich might not be everyone's first choice and Romney might not be everyone's first choice, but Obama is everyone's last choice,"" Galen said. ""A lot of those guys understand that.""","After Herman Cain's exit, several contenders have sought to claim the ""tea party candidate"" mantle .

"Washington (CNN) -- The U.S. Supreme Court has rejected a condemned Georgia inmate's request that his execution be delayed as he attempts to prove his ""actual innocence."" The justices without comment on Monday turned aside two separate appeals from Troy Davis, likely setting the stage for the state to set another execution date. Davis has gained international support for his long-standing claim he did not murder an off-duty Savannah police officer more than two decades ago. Monday's ruling is the latest in a case that is procedurally complex but, legally, a simple claim of innocence. Davis was granted a stay of execution by the U.S. Supreme Court two hours before he was to be put to death in 2008, and the court in 2009 ordered the federal District Court to take another look at the case. That court, after holding a hearing to review evidence, ruled in August that Davis ""failed to show actual innocence"" in the case. The District Court suggested that, for procedural reasons, Davis should take his appeal of its ruling directly to the Supreme Court. Davis ended up filing with both the 11th Circuit and the Supreme Court. The 11th Circuit deflected the appeal in November, saying it agreed with the district court that the Supreme Court was the correct place for the filing. Davis then took his case to the U.S. Supreme Court in January, filing two pleas. One sought review of the Georgia federal judge's rejection of the innocence claim, and the other asked for a test of the 11th Circuit's refusal to review the case. The justices on Monday turned down both pleas without comment. Davis' sister said Monday that she is ""very disappointed"" by the Supreme Court's rejection. Martina Correia-Davis said Davis' attorney told her they would continue to pursue all possible legal options, including a possible re-petition of the Georgia State Board of Parole. She said she had not spoken to Davis about Monday's decision but expected his attorney to call him soon. Correia-Davis said she doesn't want the case to be moved back to Savannah, where Davis was tried and convicted for the 1989 murder, because she doesn't think he will ""get a fair chance"" there. Witnesses said Davis, then 19, and two others were harassing a homeless man in a Burger King parking lot when off-duty officer Mark MacPhail came to the man's assistance. They testified that Davis shot MacPhail twice and fled. Since Davis' conviction in 1991, seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted their testimony. No physical evidence was presented linking Davis to the killing of the policeman. But upon reviewing Davis' claims of innocence, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Georgia found in August that Davis ""vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence."" ""Some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror,"" Judge William T. Moore wrote in a 172-page opinion. ""Other evidence that Mr. Davis brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors,"" the court found. Amnesty International, which is monitoring the case, expressed disappointment Monday that the Supreme Court had rejected the appeals. ""It appears that the justice system is comfortable allowing someone to be executed when there are lingering doubts about guilt in the case. No objective person could confidently determine that Davis is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt from the evidence available now in his case. That leaves an ominous cloud hanging over an irreversible sentence such as the death penalty,"" the international human rights group said in a statement. ""The Georgia Board of Pardons and Paroles, as the final fail-safe, has the opportunity to commute his sentence to life and prevent the possibility of executing an innocent person."" Prominent figures ranging from the pope to the musical group Indigo Girls have asked Georgia to grant Davis a new trial. Other supporters include celebrities Susan Sarandon and Harry Belafonte; world leaders such as former President Jimmy Carter and former Archbishop Desmond Tutu; and former and current U.S. lawmakers Bob Barr, Carol Moseley Braun and John Lewis.

"Washington (CNN) -- A state law mandating ""humane treatment"" of downed livestock headed for the slaughterhouse was viewed with a good measure of concern by the Supreme Court on Wednesday. At issue is whether federal regulations dealing with inspection of domesticated animals about to be killed, processed and sold for human consumption preempt -- or nullify -- California Penal Code 599f. Several justices noted the good intentions behind the state action, but a majority of the bench expressed concern that it may have gone too far into the traditional federal arena. ""So when the federal law says you can"" sometimes sell the meat of downed animals, Chief Justice John Roberts said, ""that preempts the rule from the states that says you can't."" The state law became effective in 2009, following shocking undercover video released by the Humane Society. Slaughterhouse workers in San Bernardino County outside Los Angeles were shown dragging, prodding and bulldozing weak, ""non-ambulatory"" cows into slaughter pens. Water from hoses was used on some cattle lying on their sides, to force them to their feet. Penal Code 599f would require meat processors to immediately remove downed animals and ""humanely"" euthanize them. And the sale, purchase or shipment of such animals would be criminally prohibited. The long-standing Federal Meat Inspection Act also requires animals lying down to be removed but gives discretion to federal inspectors to determine whether the livestock can recover sufficiently and become fit for slaughter and human consumption. That law expressly prohibits any state regulation ""in addition to or different from"" the federal requirements. It includes cattle, pigs, sheep and goats. The Supreme Court has long ruled that interstate commerce is under federal jurisdiction, trumping any state efforts to regulate it. The current case was brought by a meat trade group on behalf of pig farmers in California. The Obama administration is siding with pork producers, a move criticized by a number of animal rights groups. A federal appeals court in San Francisco had ruled in favor of the state law, labeling as ""hogwash"" an earlier judge's decision that favored the industry. That appeals panel concluded that ""California's prohibition of the slaughter of nonambulatory animals does not duplicate federal procedures; it withdraws from slaughter animals that are unable to walk to their death. This prohibition does not require any additional or different inspections than does the FMIA,"" the Federal Meat Inspection Act. The law's enforcement has been put on hold pending the Supreme Court's resolution of the dispute. During the high court argument, attorney Steven Wells -- representing the National Meat Association -- said, ""A slaughterhouse worker who is on the premises needs to have one set of rules that the worker follows so that the worker knows that if he follows the advice of a federal inspector ... the slaughterhouse worker won't go to jail"" by potentially violating the state law. ""And that was critical to Congress that we have this uniformity."" Several members of the court wondered whether the state could regulate some key aspects of the pre-slaughter process. ""Isn't it the case that most nonambulatory animals become nonambulatory because of the method of transportation that's used?"" said Justice Samuel Alito, citing statistics in one legal brief that hundreds of thousands of swine die annually or become too weak to stand during shipment from the farm to the slaughter pens. ""If the state could inspect the trucks at a weigh station before they get to the slaughterhouse, why can't they do the same thing when they get to the slaughterhouse, where it's more practical to do that?"" he asked. Pork producers in their legal brief estimated that about 3% of swine are nonambulatory when they arrive at the slaughterhouse. Most of the downed beasts, they say, are merely overheated, fatigued or stubborn, and most are soon back on their feet. Animal rights activists challenge that assertion. But tougher questions were directed at the lawyer for the state's attorney general. ""The federal law does not require me immediately to go over and euthanize the cow,"" Justice Stephen Breyer said. ""Your law does require me to go over and immediately euthanize the cow. And therefore, your law seems an additional requirement in respect to the operations of a federally inspected meatpacking facility."" Justice Sonia Sotomayor said federal regulations are uniquely necessary. ""If there is a valid purpose to the pre-mortem [federal] inspection -- and I can't see how you can argue otherwise -- that there may be some diseases that are so contagious that the entire lot, ambulatory or nonambulatory swine, are affected, then I don't see how you can argue that you aren't trenching on the scope of the [federal] statute"" with a separate state law. State lawyer Susan Smith said California could exclude certain animals covered under federal regulations, thereby making state regulation permissible. Such exceptions have been created in the past for horses, which can no longer be sold as meat for human use. Smith also suggested the state could conduct parallel testing of certain animals for disease. Justice Elena Kagan posed a hypothetical: California wants to test for a certain type of disease in pigs, since state officials believe federal officials are not doing a through screening. ""But that in fact requires a parallel inspection system. It's trying to do the exact same thing that the [federal agriculture] secretary is trying to do, which is trying to remove animals with a certain kind of disease, and it requires an inspection system of its own,"" Kagan said. ""And then I think that the cases seem similar to make"" regarding the current fight. The meat industry says being forced to immediately euthanize all nonambulatory animals would hurt its ability to detect and fight one particularly virulent disease: foot-and-mouth, which is highly contagious. The industry says federal inspection is preferred, since pre-slaughter inspections of sick animals are required. State law would mandate immediate killing and disposal of the lying-down livestock. The state counters that the two laws are compatible, allowing local conditions to be addressed and ensuring that moral and humane conditions are part of meat processing rules. The case is National Meat Association v. Harris (10-224). A ruling is due in a few months.","California law says downed livestock headed for slaughter must be removed, euthanized .

"(CNN) -- A free speech dispute over a California law banning the sale of violent video games to children is set to be heard in the U.S. Supreme Court this week. Arguments in Schwarzenegger v. Entertainment Merchants are scheduled to take place Tuesday and Wednesday. A 2005 state law -- designed to strengthen the current industry-controlled rating system -- would have placed an outright ban on the sale or rental of games deemed excessively ""violent"" to those under 18. As defined by California, such interactive games are those in which the player is given the choice of ""killing, maiming, dismembering or sexually assaulting an image of a human being"" in offensive ways. Retailers could be fined up to $1,000 for any violation. The law is in limbo pending the high court's ruling. Video game makers have said the ban goes too far against their free speech rights, and the existing industry-imposed, nationwide voluntary ratings system is an adequate screen for parents to judge the appropriateness of computer games. The state says it has a legal obligation to protect children when the industry has failed to do so. The motion picture industry has its own self-monitoring ratings system, imposed decades ago after complaints that some films were too explicit for the general audience. A high court ruling allowing greater government control over the evaluation of expressive content could be applied to other media. The Supreme Court in recent years has thwarted repeated congressional attempts to protect children from pornography, saying such legislation went too far in limiting adult access to lawful but explicit sexual content on the internet. The court has also said in various contexts that minors enjoy a variety of free-expression rights. CNN Supreme Court Producer Bill Mears contributed to this report.","A 2005 California state law is in limbo pending the Supreme Court's ruling .

"(CNN) -- Anytime James Carville, Paul Begala and David Axelrod hold hands and jump for joy, it's worth pondering how to turn their joy into tears. They're jubilant -- just ecstatic -- about Newt Gingrich's South Carolina victory. On the eve of the South Carolina primary, Carville opined in a CNN.com column addressed to GOP leaders, ""Let me break it to you gently -- you've got a first-class disaster on your hands."" Not to be outdone, Begala blustered in the Daily Beast, ""Above it all we can hear the weeping, the wailing, the gnashing of teeth of the Republican establishment as Gingrich's victory sends them into full-blown panic."" You know what? If Newt becomes the GOP nominee, they might be right. But they also might be wrong. Very wrong. I get a kick out of Democrats thinking they know how handicap a GOP race. If Democrats were good at thinking like Republicans, they would see the light and stop being Democrats. But instead, Democrats are so bent on seeing Republicans as a bunch of angry, right wing, intolerant, unreliable extremists that they have a track record of missing the mood of the country, especially the sentiment of people who don't wake up to The New York Times. Here's what Democratic National Committee Chair Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Florida, said just three months before the November 2010 elections: ""Really it's hard to know where the Republican Party ends and the tea party begins. ... So it has really caused, I think, a pretty difficult problem for them going into the November elections because they have candidates ... on the extreme right-wing fringe who want to end Medicare as we know it, yank the rug -- the safety net out from under our senior citizens. I mean, Americans really are going to have a very clear choice set up in November between moderate Democrats who are centrists, where the country is, and Republicans who are really off on the right-wing fringe."" Three months later, the tea party led Republicans to their biggest mid-term election victory in 72 years, winning a remarkable 63 seats in the House,along with six in the Senate. And don't forget in 1980, Democrats were cheering for Ronald Reagan to win the GOP presidential nomination, thinking he was too conservative and too much of a cowboy to appeal to mainstream voters. Of course, Reagan went on to a 44-state, 10-point thumping of incumbent Jimmy Carter. Leading Democrats, and the most of the media, similarly dismissed the Contract With America and the possibility that voters could elect the first Republican House in 40 years when that took place in 1994, led by their favorite right wing, unsteady extremist, Newt Gingrich. Given President Barack Obama's significant problem winning the support of working class, blue collar Americans, I wouldn't be so jubilant if I were on the other side. Not only is America being led by a president who thinks blue collar Americans cling to their religion and guns, or that the Cambridge police were ""stupid"" when they did their job, but the economy is bad, unemployment is high and the debt is out of sight. This president, who was elected essentially having the experience of a state senator, is in over his head and is vulnerable to defeat both substantively and personally. As anyone who knows Newt knows, he indeed could blow himself up and the dancing Democrats may have reason for joy. But I wouldn't be too quick to discount Newt's ability to strike a chord with working class, upset with Washington, ready-for-change voters who will overlook Newt's personal problems because they're drawn to his blunt, direct, tough talk. I also wouldn't so easily discount the possibility that the anti-Obama sentiment and the desire for deep and meaningful change in Washington might propel Newt to a position none of us, myself included, could have imagined two days ago.

"Washington (CNN) -- The Supreme Court has again rejected broad privacy rights for some government workers. A unanimous bench on Wednesday affirmed the government's right to conduct personal background checks on current and prospective employees under federal contract, especially those in sensitive or high-security workplaces. The ruling rejected a lawsuit by 28 long-term scientists, engineers, and others at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory near Pasadena, California. The workers, who are independent contractors, claim the mandatory checks are overly intrusive -- permitting the government to obtain information on their health, finances, personal habits, and even their sex lives. All were classified as ""low risk,"" unlikely to have a major ""adverse impact"" on the agency's mission. The forms required of workers ""consist of reasonable, employment-related inquiries that further the government's interests in managing its internal operations,"" said Justice Samuel Alito for the 8-0 court. Justice Elena Kagan did not participate, since she briefed the case last year as the government's solicitor general, before being nominated to the court by President Obama. At issue was whether there is a constitutional right to ""informational privacy,"" free from overly intrusive state scrutiny. The high court 33 years ago suggested such a right existed, but the concept has rarely been tested since. The latest dispute comes amid a general increase in security concerns in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The plaintiffs in the case argued they are not federal employees, but work at the California Institute of Technology, a private university that operates the JPL for the space agency. They claim they are low-risk workers whose work is in the private domain, and that the university already conducted background checks when they were first hired. Nevertheless, they were required to submit information to NASA, allowing the facility to maintain its broader security clearance as a government contractor. In a 2004 presidential directive, NASA and all federal agencies were ordered to increase their security measures. All civil servants and contractors are now issued special ID badges and cards after first undergoing fingerprint checks and thorough screenings of their professional and personal lives. Investigators are permitted to read criminal, financial and medical records, and to speak with friends, family, and neighbors of the workers. All federal employees and applicants are subject to such background checks, and the government says that applies to contractors as well. After some JPL workers complained, the lab posted a ""suitability matrix"" on its Web site, listing criteria it believed NASA would consider when deciding suitability for future and continued employment. Such factors, the lawsuit noted, included ""carnal knowledge, sodomy, indecent exposure, voyeurism, obscene telephone calls, indecent proposals, incest, bestiality, homosexuality, cohabitation, adultery, illegitimate children, and mental, emotional, psychological, or psychiatric issues."" During oral arguments last October, Alito had, along with some of his colleagues, expressed some concern about the government's assertions. ""Is there any limit?"" he asked. ""Suppose the government says: 'Well, we want to know all about your diet. We want to know whether you smoke cigarettes. We want to know everything you read. We want to know what your hobbies are, what forms of entertainment you enjoy, sexual practices, every aspect of your private life, just because that gives us a better picture of who you are as an employee.' Is that OK?"" The Justice Department's lawyer, Neal Katyal, said at the time there are limits, but added the government should have wide discretion to determine specific areas of inquiry, with appropriate safeguards. Alito in his 23-page opinion agreed. ""We reject the argument the government, when it requests job-related personal information in an employment background check, has a constitutional burden to demonstrate its questions are 'necessary' or the least restrictive means of furthering its interests,"" he wrote. Last term, the high court ruled that a government worker did not enjoy a ""reasonable expectation"" of privacy on his official wireless two-way text-messaging pager. A California police officer had sued after authorities reviewed his phone records because of what they believed was excessive use of the pager device on the job. The review found hundreds of personal messages, some of a ""sexually . explicit"" nature, to his wife, a girlfriend and a fellow officer. The officer then sued for invasion of privacy, but lost at the high court. Private employees generally have less workplace privacy than do government workers. The JPL case raised the question of rights enjoyed in the quasi-official world of government contractors. In the JPL dispute, workers who refused to allow the background checks could be fired. The government told the high court that anyone receiving a government employment check should expect a security check. Justice Department lawyers warned that a ruling against the government would jeopardize its ability to obtain necessary information from contractors and regular government staff members. The case is National Aeronautics and Space Administration v. Nelson (09-530).","The high court affirms personal background checks by the government .
The ruling applies to current and prospective employees under government contract .
The lawsuit was filed by scientists, engineers and others at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ."
"(CNN) -- ""I just get sick and tired, quite frankly, of all this talk. Everything that has to do with the federal branch of government ... is bad, and states are good. I remind you that ... the reason the federal government got into 90% of the business it got into is that the state[s] ... did not do the job."" When Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware made this statement as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee in 1981 at the confirmation hearing of Supreme Court nominee Sandra Day O'Connor, he was referring to statements by his colleagues suggesting that the judgment of state courts was entitled to greater legitimacy than those of federal courts. But Biden could well have delivered similar remarks at last week's NAACP Convention, where he spoke days after several Southern governors, led by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, announced that they will not participate in the health insurance exchanges or Medicaid expansion provisions of the health care law. No matter that 25% of Texans are uninsured, reportedly the highest rate among all states. Perry and the other governors want to burnish their anti-Barack Obama bona fides to an ever-hungry tea party base. These elected leaders are following a longstanding tradition in American politics of Southern states acting against the best interest of their residents. As Biden's 1981 remarks suggest, a good reason the federal government has expanded and occupied areas that might be best served by state government is precisely because of the lack of leadership that has too often been the hallmark of state governments. This has been particularly true in the South, where the idea of state sovereignty and racial injustice often went hand in hand. From the Civil War to the civil rights movement 100 years later, the call for ""states' rights"" long stood for the desire of Southern states to mistreat their black residents. That's why the invocation of this term -- as it was by Ronald Reagan, when he launched his 1980 presidential campaign in Philadelphia, Mississippi -- has become a kind of code that carries offensive racial implications. Resistance to the federal government -- in particular, the liberal decisions of Earl Warren's Supreme Court, President Lyndon Johnson's Great Society and Congress' enactment of a series of civil rights laws targeted at discriminatory state conduct -- served as a rallying point for disaffected white Southerners. What is most distressing about the elaborate displays of failed leadership by Southern governors who rail against the reach of the federal government is their willingness to sacrifice the needs of their most vulnerable. The starkest historical example is the 1959 decision of Prince Edward County, a Virginia school district, to close schools for five years rather than comply with desegregation orders after Brown v. Board of Education, crippling the local education system and ensuring that a generation of black students would be unable to complete their K-12 education. The county's decision followed the lead of Virginia's powerful senator, Harry F. Byrd Sr., who authored the Southern Manifesto, which called for state-based ""massive resistance"" to school integration. To be fair, the phenomenon of bellicose or ineffective state leadership is not limited to the South or to Republicans. Only six states initially chose to opt in when Medicaid was first launched back in the 1960s. Those who chose to ignore Medicaid were merely delaying the inevitable. While governors postured, poor women and children fell through the cracks in the health care system. Ultimately, all states would join Medicaid. In 2009, while the country was coping with the effects of the Great Recession and unemployment was high, Republican governors from the South led the call to reject stimulus money for the extension of unemployment benefits. But a year later, it was two states in the Midwest -- Ohio and Wisconsin -- that decided to turn down hundreds of millions of dollars in federal stimulus money for rail projects. Likewise, legislators in New Hampshire have forfeited millions of federal transportation dollars, not to mention tens of millions in saved medical costs, because they do not want to enact a primary mandatory seat belt law, making the state the only one in the country without such a requirement. Responsibility for failed policies on the state level, however, does not fall solely on the shoulders of elected state leaders. Voters must also act wisely to adopt the best policies, practices and laws for the common good. California was admonished by the U.S. Supreme Court last year and ordered to reduce the severe overcrowding in its prisons. But it was the decision of Californian voters to adopt ever more irrational and punitive criminal sentencing laws -- such as ""three strikes you're out"" -- that ballooned the state's prison population and resulted in the Supreme Court's intervention. This November, California voters have an opportunity to revise some of the ill-advised ""three strikes"" sentences. The ball is in their court. What is desperately needed now in state government is the principled leadership of elected leaders. The economy has brought about the most challenging state fiscal crisis in several generations. To provide for the needs of its residents -- whether it's in education, jobs, housing, public safety or health care -- states will have to cooperate with the business and the nonprofit community, but more importantly, with the federal government. Partisan posturing will benefit only candidates but hurt the common people. State government can be the most appropriate locus of government power in many important areas. Those who argue against the size and reach of the federal government should first demand that state leaders act responsibly and in the best interests of all their residents. Otherwise, it is the duty of the voters to speak up at the polls. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Sherrilyn A. Ifill.","Some Southern governors said they will not participate in the health care law .

"Washington (CNN) -- Homeowners who wound up paying thousands more dollars in special taxes than their neighbors for the same sewage service found no relief at the Supreme Court on Monday. The justices, by a 6-3 vote, upheld the decision by city officials in Indianapolis to deny refunds for some residents who paid their assessment fees up front, while forgiving the remaining taxes of those choosing an installment plan. Chief Justice John Roberts, in a tough dissent, said the result was a ""gross disparity."" Those with the heftier bills sued, saying their Equal Protection rights under the Constitution were being violated. The city had abandoned its installment plan option after just one year, and Justice Stephen Breyer said that was a proper exercise of government, since it reduced administrative costs. ""The city had a rational basis for distinguishing between those lot owners who had already paid their share of project costs and those who had not. And we conclude there is no equal protection violation,"" he said. ""State law says nothing about forgiveness, how to design a forgiveness program, or whether or when rational distinctions in doing so are permitted."" He said the Supreme Court stepping in ""would risk transforming ordinary violations of ordinary state tax law into violations of the federal Constitution."" Indiana allows public works projects to be apportioned, meaning costs can be spread equally along ""all abutting lands or lots."" The Brisbane/Manning Sanitary Sewers Project began in 2001, to connect about 180 Indianapolis homes to the city's existing sewage system. Thirty-eight homeowners individually decided to pay their assessments up front -- $9,278. The rest agreed to monthly installments spread over 10 to 30 years, including interest. But the city soon decided to shelve the long-standing assessment plan, concluding the lot-by-lot payments were discouraging families from moving from less healthy septic systems to more efficient sewer systems. The new public improvements financing system adopted by Indianapolis now relies on a single, flat $2,500 fee to connect sewer lines. City-issued bonds would help cover remaining costs. Outstanding payments under the old method were canceled, but refunds were denied those who had already paid in in full. Court records show some property owners on the installment plan paid as little as $309, and a quarter of the rest put in less than $1,000. The 38 homeowners who had paid in full asked for a partial refund, but officials in the state capital said in a letter that to provide one ""would establish a precedent of unfair and inequitable treatment to all property owners"" who had also paid the assessments throughout the city, even partially. Thirty-one homeowners then sued, claiming disparate treatment. The average claim was about $8,000. Breyer said the city's desire to reduce ""financial hardships"" for those paying under the old lot-by-lot system was adequate justification for the change, and did not amount to a constitutional violation. He said the controversy was a local one, not implicating interstate commerce. But Roberts disagreed sharply. ""Every generation or so, a case comes along when this court needs to say enough is enough, if the Equal Protection Clause is to retain any force in this context."" Joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel Alito, Roberts added that the city promised to treat all homeowners the same, but ""ended up charging some homeowners 30 times what it charged their neighbors for the same hook-ups. The equal protection violation is plain."" Groups opposing the city were disappointed in the decision. ""The Equal Protection Clause is supposed to mean what it says: that people are entitled to equal treatment,"" explained Institute for Justice attorney Robert McNamara, who filed a supporting brief in the case. ""But the lesson of today's decision is less 'people must be treated equally' and more 'never pay the government up front.'"" The case is Armour v. City of Indianapolis (11-161).","Homeowners seeking a refund of special tax payments lose their appeal .
The Supreme Court, in a 6-3 ruling, says the city had a rational basis for its action .

"Princeton, New Jersey (CNN) -- Washington is stifled by gridlock. As New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie said in his speech at the Ronald Reagan Library, ""We drift from conflict to conflict, with little or no resolution."" Even the most routine budgeting decisions turn into high-stakes showdowns with threats of default and government shutdowns. The party leaders are deep into a mindset with which they feel free to threaten, cajole and refuse to act until the very last moment. Big decisions are put off. Small issues are barely resolved. Gridlock, however, is not politically neutral. The conventional wisdom is that under current conditions nothing gets done -- and neither party benefits. But in fact, the chronic battles over budget decisions tend to benefit the Republican agenda. While it seems that neither side is making progress when the government machine grinds to a halt, in fact Democrats keep losing as the agenda shifts toward the right. Gridlock benefits Republicans and, more broadly, conservative politics, for several reasons. The first is that without normalized and predictable budgets, government agencies can't engage in long-term planning. Agency heads have to scramble from month to month just to keep existing programs intact. The notion of designing long-term plans to improve and strengthen programs goes out the window. Even an agency like the Federal Emergency Management Agency can't count on having the funds that it needs in dire emergencies. The result is that the key agencies of government are steadily weakened. A government in gridlock also fails to update programs as times change. As the political scientists Suzanne Mettler and Andrew Milstein found, the inflation-adjusted value of welfare payments, the minimum wage, food stamps and unemployment benefits all fell steadily after the 1970s. The second reason that Democrats are harmed by gridlock is because a dysfunctional Washington fuels public distrust in the federal government. A CNN/ORC poll recently found that only 15% of the public trusts government to do what is right always or most of the time, a notable decline from the 25% level in September 2010. When the public does not trust the government, Republicans win. After all, a key argument of modern conservatism has been that government intervention, at least when it comes to domestic issues, is bad. ""Government is not the solution to our problem,"" President Ronald Reagan said, ""Government is the problem."" That argument resonates much more when voters are watching the current circus in the nation's capital. It is not surprising that the conservative movement flourished in the 1970s and 1980s, two decades that witnessed a sharp decline in public trust of government institutions. As gridlock generates doubts about the ability of politicians to handle problems, the ability of Democrats to win support for federal programs vastly diminishes. Finally, gridlock shrinks the political space that exists to propose new programs. With gridlock this strong, and a budget process that is so grueling, most of the energy in Washington turns toward protecting existing programs from elimination. Ultimately, a strong Democratic Party can only thrive when it is possible to push new government initiatives. Otherwise, the party loses much of its vibrancy and becomes a more moderate shadow of the GOP. While Republicans push to cut domestic programs, Democrats are left simply calling for smaller cuts. This is not the kind of rallying cry that a party needs to galvanize strong majorities, nor is it a way to build a historical legacy. For all these reasons, a period of gridlock is a period of Republican strength. Perhaps the toughest part about this for Democrats is that the impact of the paralysis is not visible to most Americans, including many of the party's most loyal supporters. Voters simply see an entire system that is broken and one where nothing appears to get done. The reality, however, is that Republicans keep moving forward as their opponents stand still. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Julian E. Zelizer.","Julian Zelizer: On the surface, it seems gridlock hurts both parites .

"(CNN) -- I met Jerry Sandusky in the late 1990s. I was at Penn State conducting a workshop with coaches on sexual violence. It was a few years after my retirement from professional football and a decade removed from my days at Syracuse University, where I competed against Sandusky's defense on the playing field. I had great respect for Sandusky as a coach and remember his masterful game plan in the 1986 national championship, when Penn State defeated Miami with its impeccable strategy, devised by the architect of ""Linebacker U."" I spoke with Sandusky and found he was not a typical defensive coach. He was pleasant and passionate about his charity, The Second Mile, and the work it did to help young men find their way. I was thoroughly impressed. If the allegations that Sandusky sexually abused young boys are true, it would defy the common misperception that pedophiles are monstrous misfits. But it would fit in with the true profile. When I began working in the field of sexual and domestic violence prevention in 1995, I was stunned to find that more than 80% of rape survivors know the men who attack them. The vast majority of sexual predators rely on an insidiously derived trust that not only provides access to their victims, but works to maintain their anonymity even in the light of day. They often stand on a broader, established reputation and use threats and gifts to maintain their victims' silence. When I served on the board of Stop It Now, which is focused on the prevention of sexual abuse of children, I learned that more than 90% of abused children know their attacker. Once again, this defies our misguided belief that predators are like lions in the tall grass waiting to attack. The overwhelming reality is that they are individuals who manipulate trust and positions of power to gain access to their victims and control them. It is this reality that has led to such terms as ""intimate partner violence"" and ""interpersonal violence"" and ""acquaintance rape."" Trust, access and familiarity are the tools of sustained abuse. It is important to note that, in most cases, men are the abusers. This is essential in developing prevention strategies that are grounded in an accurate assessment of who commits the crimes. Ignoring the gender of the abusers fits in with our broad view that sexual predators are ""monsters,"" or social deviants living in shadows. We think of men as the sturdy keepers of social status and power, and the standard bearers of a decent society that plays by the rules. Sandusky established a level of trust with his charity work consistent with the commitment he showed for the institutions he represented for most of his life. As a football coach at Penn State, Sandusky was the epitome of its image and reputation. The program under Joe Paterno is considered one of the cleanest in college football, boasting high graduation rates and on-field performance. The image, right down to the Nittany Lion uniform, has been conservative and upstanding. As a prominent coach in that system, Sandusky was a central figure. It's not hard to understand why many around him might have a vested interest in maintaining that perception. Penn State stood above in the hypercompetitive and often unscrupulous world of college sports, and this served as a recruiting tool and an assurance to parents of promising high school football players. It's also not hard to understand why parents of troubled young men would want their sons to have the influence of the environment that Penn State and Sandusky provided. It would be convenient to consider a child abuser a ""monster."" It would be convenient to call the alleged coverup a ""mistake"" by a couple of college administrators who sought to protect their institutional reputation. That talk has already begun, in part because we don't want to look at the issue of child sexual abuse or abandon the beliefs we hold, including and especially our faith in sports. But that faith and trust is waning. In an attempt to preserve a storied reputation, Joe Paterno has called on all ""Penn Staters to trust what that (institution) stands for."" If these charges are true, that same veil of trust might have allowed a child sexual predator to go undetected. The world of sports contains many good men. But there is also a culture of silence upon which the myth of men thrives. We often speak of sports in terms of courage and integrity. Those altruistic qualities must transcend the field and be brought to bear for the protection of our children. The opinions in this commentary are solely those of Don McPherson.","Don McPherson met Jerry Sandusky at Penn State, had great respect for him .

"(CNN) -- Last week, the ""Republican War on Women"" morphed into the ""Democrat War on Mommies."" The shots that started both wars were fired by two commentators, Rush Limbaugh and Hilary Rosen. Whose words were worse? Rush wins that contest, in my book. His words were offensive in and of themselves. Hilary's words were offensive because the context they were used in led people to see them as a slight to stay-at-home moms. Later in the week, Mitt Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom and President Obama adviser David Axelrod got into a Twitter duel, or maybe we should just call it tweet-for-tat. Fehrnstrom took umbrage with recent anti-Ann Romney comments made by comedian and Obama donor Bill Maher. Axelrod, in turn, accused Fehrnstrom of ""studied outrage."" If the outrage was studied, it came straight from the Democrats' playbook. What we learned in Limbaugh-gate was then applied to Rosen-gate. The lessons will be with us for other campaigns to follow. When Rush made his comments attacking Sandra Fluke, Republicans were slow to react. It wasn't until days after that more Republican voices started to publicly disagree with what he'd said. Romney finally gave a tepid answer saying it wasn't the language he would have used. Democrats were quick and skillful in branding Rush's words with the Republican label, which they stamped on every Republican running for anything in America. The presidential candidates all disagreed with his claims but were left to pay the price. It took several days for Rush to apologize and only after a national boycott of his radio show, leaving some to perceive the apology as economically motivated. What began as a strong Republican defense of religious liberties turned into an epic battle for women's rights. Democrats cleverly coined it the ""War on Women."" It was a brilliant move. Polls showed a gender gap favoring Obama of as much as 20 points. Both camps understand the election can hinge on who women support and how many of us turn out. Obama hosted a women's forum in the White House. Romney began using multiple rows of women as backdrops at his events. He held a roundtable with women, and his campaign organized a women-themed conference call, all within hours of each other. Both candidates engaged in a blatantly political chess game to outmaneuver each other to show their feminine side. Just then, Democrat strategist Hilary Rosen said in an interview that Ann Romney ""has never worked a day in her life."" Republicans gave Democrats a taste of their own medicine. It took minutes for GOP operatives to denounce the ""War on Mommies"" and spring into action pinning Rosen's words on Obama's. Democrats wasted no time either. They triple dissed her -- disowned, disagreed and distanced. In less than 24 hours, President Obama, Michelle Obama, Joe Biden and every campaign staffer from David Axelrod to the lowliest intern was disavowing Rosen's statement. Hilary herself learned from Rush what not to do. She apologized quickly, sincerely and repeatedly. She put her ego aside, not easy for any of us in the business of politics, and recognized the best course of action for her party was not to add fuel to the fire by endlessly defending herself. She canceled a scheduled appearance on Meet the Press. Political messaging has become an art form. It matters less if outrage is genuine or exaggerated and more that it is believable and contagious. Amid all the carefully contrived women frenzy, the substance of the issues can end up lost on the battlefield. Unfortunately, we haven't spent nearly as much time clearly articulating what the candidates are specifically proposing to improve women's lives as we have hurling accusations and making declarations of war. In the not-too-distant future, political science classes will compare these two incidents as case studies in political crisis management 101. Humans make mistakes. In today's world, any gaffe can go viral in minutes and turn into a major issue. It's crucial to react immediately, express strongly worded disagreement and regret, and then recede in hopes it will die quickly in the ever-churning news cycle. The other side should pounce on every opportunity to turn an unfortunate choice of words into an all-out war over a noble cause or demographic group and fan the flames of outrage and rebellion. In the meantime, all of us engaged in punditry will be reciting the Analysts' Prayer: ""Dear Lord, Please keep me from saying things I will regret, words I'd rather forget. Let me give views, not make news. If I fail, let me be wise and quickly apologize.""

"New York (CNN) -- An Egyptian executive accused of sexually abusing an employee at a luxury hotel in New York pleaded guilty Friday to sex abuse in the third degree and will also face a $5 million lawsuit tied to the case, his attorney said. Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar, 74, the chairman of a salt company who once headed an Egyptian bank, had originally been charged with sexual abuse, unlawful imprisonment, forcible touching and harassment. He was sentenced to five days' community service, which Omar has already completed. He must also submit his DNA to the state database, said Joan Vollero, a representative for the Manhattan district attorney. ""He pled guilty in order to get back to his family in Egypt,"" said Omar's attorney, Lori Cohen. ""What he pled guilty to is less serious than jumping a turnstile in New York."" Omar had initially pleaded not guilty, attorney Lori Cohen said. The incident took place at New York's Pierre hotel on May 29, 15 days after Dominique Strauss-Kahn, then head of the International Monetary Fund, was accused of sexually assaulting and trying to rape a housekeeping employee at another New York luxury hotel. Omar has not made any public statements. The accuser told police the attack took place when the employee went to Omar's room to drop off tissues he had requested. His trial had been set to begin August 23.","Mahmoud Abdel-Salam Omar was sentenced to five days' community service .

"On CNN's ""State of the Union,"" CNN host and chief national correspondent John King goes outside the Beltway to report on the issues affecting communities across the country. This week, King traveled to Peoria, Illinois, to explore how the recession is hitting the blue-collar town hard. Chris Guynn says he's grateful that his wife has a full-time job while he studies for life after Caterpillar. PEORIA, Illinois (CNN) -- Suddenly, this city's motto rings hollow: ""It's Better Here"" doesn't match the mood in a place where the recession hit late but is now hitting hard. ""I just felt, I thought I couldn't lose with this company"" is how Chris Guynn described his motivation for moving his wife and two children to Peoria from Las Vegas, Nevada. There was a job waiting at Caterpillar, the 80-year-old heavy equipment giant, and ""It was a company that you could just retire with, great pension, retirement, 401 and so on."" Guynn is one of 20,000 workers Caterpillar will shed by the end of the first quarter of 2009, a decision the company announced this week. The company says the job cuts are necessary because of a decline in orders that it attributed to the U.S. and global recession. Now, Guynn is enrolled at classes at Central Illinois College, grateful his wife has a full-time job at a local call center, and was nervously waiting to find out not if but when his last day would be. That shoe dropped Friday, when 814 employees at the Mossville plant who had gotten notice that they would be let go arrived at work to learn that this was their final day.  Watch how one family tries to cope with layoffs » . There was more bad news: On Friday, Caterpillar announced that it is eliminating an additional 2,110 jobs at three Illinois plants to match production with falling demand. To visit Peoria is to meet the faces behind the numbers: rising new claims for unemployment benefits and the rising state and national unemployment rates. Guynn follows the news and knows that a major economic stimulus package is being debated in Washington. Guynn is skeptical when he hears that politicians are looking to spend more than $800 billion, yet he does voice faith in the new president who calls Illinois home. ""I believe he's going to help it out,"" Guynn said in an interview at the college. ""Everyone is worth giving that chance to. ... I want to give him a fair shot. I know it's not going to happen overnight, but I'm willing to see what he's going to do."" Still, Guynn acknowledges that not all anxious workers are as patient. ''I mean, it was basically left to him, you know, he didn't really do it, in my opinion, but it's his problem now."" As President Obama works to meet those high expectations and deal with mounting conservative criticism of his approach, Guynn is hoping his classes eventually land him a new career as a crime lab technician. ""I'm 36 years old. I've waited many years to get back into school, but finally I'm doing it. This is the perfect time. ... I'm not happy to get laid off, but at the same time, I'm looking to further myself with a better career."" Christy Williams' choices are starkly different. She is a single mother of five young children, ranging in age from 5 to 14. Not having a second income to help cushion the blow of losing her job at Caterpillar adds to the stress, something Williams vows to keep hidden from her children. To that end, she waited until the end of her two-week notice period before telling them Mom would suddenly be spending more time at home. ""I don't let them see that I'm stressed out about things,"" Williams told us as her two youngest watched television in a lower-level family room of her Peoria home. ""I waited. I didn't tell them right away. The two 5-year-olds, I didn't think they would understand what that meant anyway. So I just waited until I was done working, and then I said, 'Things are going to be a little bit different. I'm going to be home in the morning, you know, when you go to school and when you get home from school.' And we've just kind of gone that route."" Williams, who worked as an administrative assistant, had never been laid off. She has a four-year college degree and initially was optimistic that she would quickly find work. Now, with about 10 weeks of unemployment benefits left and a bleak job market, Williams is getting more nervous and keeping an even more watchful eye on the family budget. ""Just everything in general has been, had to be cut back,"" she says. ""I really went into it thinking I would have a much easier time finding a new job. Looking for something, I thought it was going to be easier for me than it has been."" Williams shrugs when asked how the politicians in Washington could help her as they debate an economic stimulus package and says she is beginning to compromise in her job search, looking for openings in retail sales or other positions that would pay her less than at Caterpillar but allow her to keep up with the mortgage and feed her children. ""I'm very nervous,"" Williams said. ""I'm very nervous of what will be available, and every day on the news, there's more layoffs that are being shown, in our town as well as the nation."" Williams said she has no advice for President Obama and Congress, but she is watching ""now more than ever."" On the floor of one of Caterpillar's giant assembly plants, however, Jim Lierle is quick with a warning that lawmakers looking to help blue-collar workers like him might think again about one idea gaining steam in Congress. The House and Senate versions of the legislation include ""Buy American"" clauses that direct the stimulus money to American made goods and services. On the surface, that should help Caterpillar, whose giant earth movers and other heavy equipment would be in demand if billions are spent on highway and other infrastructure problems. But there is a reason the recession hit late here: Half or more of Caterpillar's business is tied to overseas exports, and only recently has the global slowdown caught up with the squeeze many American manufacturers were already feeling at home. If Congress mandates ""buy American,"" Lierle echoes Caterpillar management in worrying other countries will retaliate with trade sanctions, and the company's exports will dip even more.

"New York (CNN) -- New York state's top police official announced Wednesday he was quitting, the second acting superintendent to step down in as many weeks. In a letter to embattled Gov. David Paterson, Pedro Perez denied his resignation was connected to the ethics scandals embroiling Albany. ""My retirement is not premised on the current investigation by the Attorney General [Andrew Cuomo], as I know my decisions were honest and rightly motivated,"" Perez said in the letter, which the New York State Police released. Perez's resignation takes effect Friday and ends his 28-year career as a police officer, his letter said. His predecessor, Harry Corbitt, quit March 2, less than a week after the abrupt resignation of Denise O'Donnell as New York's deputy secretary for public safety. O'Donnell said Corbitt had misled her about state police involvement in a scandal involving a top aide to the governor. The Democratic governor has been mired in controversy since news reports emerged alleging an aide was involved in a domestic violence incident with a woman and that state police later allegedly pressured the woman to keep quiet. The aide, David Johnson, has been suspended without pay. Corbitt has said he did not dispute O'Donnell's account of what he told her but said, ""The conclusions she appeared to draw from these statements were incorrect."" Separately, the New York State Commission on Public Integrity on March 3 accused Paterson of an ethics violation for allegedly accepting free tickets to the first game of last year's World Series. The commission also said Paterson lied under oath about intending to pay for the tickets. Paterson's spokesman, Peter Kauffmann, resigned the next day, saying he could not keep doing his job ""in good conscience."" The governor's office said it was reviewing the commission's findings. ""Gov. Paterson maintains his innocence and intends to challenge the findings of the commission both with respect to the law and the facts,"" the office said. The governor could face up to an $80,000 fine for violating the state's gift ban for public officials, and up to $10,000 if he is found to have used his official position to secure unwarranted privileges. The commission has asked Cuomo, the state's attorney general, and the Albany County district attorney to investigate. Cuomo is a possible Democratic contender for the governor's office in 2010. Paterson, a former New York lieutenant governor who stepped into the governor's mansion when Eliot Spitzer resigned in 2008 over a prostitution scandal, has abandoned his campaign for election to a full term, saying it was not the ""latest distraction but an accumulation"" of obstacles behind his decision. CNN's Mark J. Norman contributed to this report.","Pedro Perez stepping down as New York State Police's acting superintendent .

"Washington (CNN) -- The fight over extending a payroll tax cut and long-term unemployment benefits resumes Tuesday as Congress returns to work after its winter break. While aides in both parties say it's likely Congress will resolve that dispute, Republicans are still licking their wounds after a public backlash over how they handled those issues and fear that Senate Democrats will drag out the fight to score more political points in an election year. And Democrats are concerned that House Republicans will insist on adding more items to the measures to try to keep conservatives on board. According to a new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday, only 11% of Americans approve of how Congress is handling its job . The previous all-time low approval rating for Congress was 14%, set in August, at the very end of the debt ceiling debate which resulted in an unpopular agreement between the two parties. Legislators returning on a cold and rainy Tuesday morning were greeted by scores of sign-carrying protesters as part of an Occupy Congress rally. Two demonstrators were detained, including one who was later charged with assaulting a police officer, according to U.S. Capitol Police Sgt. Kimberly Schneider. Organizers of the protest said the day-long event will include teach-ins, a march and a pink slip -- a notice of termination -- for each member of Congress. As the sun broke through in the early afternoon, the crowd had grown to several hundred protesters. Inside the Capitol, the presidential campaign will take center stage this year. President Barack Obama already has made clear he plans to run against a ""do-nothing"" Congress and will likely highlight that theme during the annual State of the Union address next week. Facing that high-profile push against them, and with the fight for control of both chambers in the balance, lawmakers know they have to do some heavy lifting to convince voters they deserve re-election. Democrats, who run the Senate, and Republicans, who control the House, acknowledge that outside of the payroll tax cut bill, no major legislation is expected to make it through Congress this year. However, each party promises a series of bills to advance what it thinks the public wants from Capitol Hill in response to the weak economy. For both sides, these efforts will be more about political messaging than actually legislating because few, if any, are likely to become law. Congressional tensions . This week, House Republicans will huddle at their annual three-day retreat in Baltimore to map out their 2012 agenda and strategy for responding to Obama and congressional Democrats. But high on the agenda at that meeting for House Speaker John Boehner is likely to be an effort to bridge severe divisions with his own rank-and-file, many of whom questioned his leadership over the course of several showdowns with the White House and Democrats last year. Conservatives want Boehner to be more aggressive in standing for their principles. Tensions between Senate Democrats and Republicans are also high. The president's decision earlier this month to make a recess appointment of Richard Cordray to head the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau while Congress was technically not recessed drew a swift and angry response from Republicans. Top GOP aides privately grumbled the move set a bad tone for the coming year and invited Republicans to be even less cooperative. And with key economic nominees needing Senate confirmation, including a new director of the Office of Management and Budget after Jack Lew was named White House chief of staff, Republicans could cause problems for the president and Senate Democrats. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Congress spent months on issues unnecessarily last year, pointing out that President Ronald Reagan raised the debt ceiling 18 times while in the White House. ""We've had obstructionism on steroids,"" Reid said. A top Senate Democratic leadership aide said the party isn't overly concerned. That's because Democrats believe GOP obstructionism is at such a high level now -- where filibusters are routine -- they already expect a major fight on every nominee. Finishing the payroll tax cut bill . When Congress limped out of town before Christmas, it agreed to a two-month extension of a bill that cuts payroll taxes, extends unemployment benefits and prevents a cut in the rate paid to doctors who care for Medicare patients. As they begin talks on an extension for the rest of 2012, both sides remain highly skeptical and suspicious of each other. Questions linger for congressional negotiators -- how to pay for the $200 billion price tag and whether to tighten requirements for unemployment benefits. Democrats are worried Republicans will push for other issues, such as renewing their demand for the approval of the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline or the elimination of a range of Environmental Protection Agency regulations on businesses. Some in the GOP are wary the White House and Senate Democrats will try again to pass a surtax on millionaires -- something even some Democrats don't support -- as a way of painting the GOP as protectors of the rich. ""The only way this process will not go smoothly and through regular order is if the White House chooses to disrupt it for political reasons,"" said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. Informal discussions between House and Senate negotiators have already begun. Reid told ""Meet the Press"" that he hopes the tea party faction in the House doesn't have the same influence on talks that it did in December's impasse, calling that ""bad for the country."" ""I would hope the two Republican leaders would have learned from what took place in the previous year,"" Reid said. Debt ceiling again . Right out of the gate when Congress returns, lawmakers will have to respond formally to the president's recent request to raise the debt ceiling. As part of the choreography agreed to last summer, members will get a chance to vote against the president's request, but it's mostly for show because the reality is Congress doesn't have the votes to block an increase. Two other significant bills need attention this winter. One is a new Federal Aviation Administration bill that is stalled over disputes on labor rights and a costly government program to subsidize air travel to rural areas. Senators also want to pass a highway bill that would fund road and bridge construction for the next two years. Obama is supposed to formally submit his budget for 2013 in February. Last year, Republicans criticized his budget for failing to reform entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security, which represent the bulk of the nation's massive budget deficit. ""If he punts again, it will be clear the White House plans to spend the year on autopilot. We think that would be unacceptable to the American people,"" Boehner's aide said. On the Keystone matter, the administration already is facing a congressionally mandated deadline on February 21 to approve the project or explain why it won't. Democrats say they expect the White House to reject the plan, because the administration has said it can't finish its environmental review by then, but Republicans are promising to continue to hammer the administration on the issue. Bills to help the economy and send a message to voters . In addition to their push for Keystone, House Republicans are planning votes early this year on legislation that would expand domestic energy production and upgrade transportation infrastructure across the country. The bill will include offshore drilling, energy exploration in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR), as well as give money to states along with more flexibility to build roads and bridges. The new spending on highway projects would be offset by revenue from oil and gas leases. But the White House is unlikely to support the GOP proposals and they are unlikely to go anywhere in the Democratic-led Senate. Even without much hope for actually passing these bills, House Republican aides stress they will continue focusing on measures to boost the weak economy to show they are responding to voters' concerns, and they emphasize that many of these proposals have had Democratic support. ""The House is going to continue to work hard to produce results for small businesses, working families and middle-class Americans,"" one House GOP aide told CNN. ""If the president wishes to ignore Congress and play political games, that's his decision, but by doing so he will own the gridlock,"" the aide said. In addition to the bills on jobs, the House also is expected to take up legislation to make more transparent members of Congress' stock trades and other financial transactions. GOP leaders plan to vote on the so-called ""STOCK Act"" which would ban lawmakers from using any non-public information to trade stocks or make other financial transactions. Senate Democrats want to draw a line to job creation with almost everything they do this year. That starts with the highway and FAA bills, which Democrats say will create thousands of jobs. It will then continue all year with a myriad of bills Democrats think will prove to a wary public they are putting jobs first. A measure to fund school construction is another example of a bill Democrats hope to highlight. Lawmakers from both parties say they are determined before the end of the year to prevent deep cuts to the defense budget as called for after the deficit reduction ""super committee"" failed to reach a deal to slash the deficit. Aides said serious work to find alternative spending reductions probably won't happen until after the election in November. Control of Congress . As voters go to the polls this year, members are expected to spend less time in Washington and more time in their districts making the case for why their party ought to be steering the country's economic agenda. Democrats need to pick up 25 seats to regain control of the House -- a high hurdle, but one many Democrats feel is within reach because they think voters will blame Republicans for the gridlock in Washington. Senate Republicans feel more confident they can win control of their chamber, especially after the retirements of several key Democratic senators in states that lean Republican. Right now, the Democrats hold a 53-47 advantage. But Democrats are defending 23 seats this year while Republicans are working to hold just 10. The recent announcement by Sen. Ben Nelson, a conservative Democrat from Nebraska, that he would not seek re-election is seen by Republicans as another sign Democrats will lose majority control.

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- Michelle Obama arrived in Mexico City at the start of her first solo official trip as first lady. Obama, fresh off an unannounced stop in Haiti, was greeted Tuesday night at Benito Juarez International Airport by Carlos Pascual, the U.S. ambassador to Mexico; and Arturo Sarukhan, the Mexican ambassador to the United States. The White House says the three-day visit is taking place ""in recognition of the deep ties between the United States and Mexico."" Obama has several visits and tours scheduled, including a meeting Wednesday with Mexican first lady Margarita Zavala at Los Pinos, the Mexican president's residence. Other events on her itinerary include a tour of the Museo Nacional de Antropologia (National Museum of Anthropology) and a public elementary school that serves low-income students. The first lady also will give a speech Wednesday at the Universidad Iberoamericana and will attend a reception with women leaders at Los Pinos and a dinner hosted by Mexican President Felipe Calderon and his wife. Before leaving Thursday, Obama is scheduled to hold a breakfast for young Mexican leaders and visit the U.S. Embassy in Mexico City. The first lady's visit reinforces the priority the White House gives Mexico despite the domestic and international problems President Obama faces, university political science professor Miguel Angel Valenzuela Shelley told Notimex, Mexico's state-run news service. In January, about a week before he was sworn in, President Obama met with Calderon in Washington. The meeting at the Mexican Cultural Institute fulfilled a tradition in effect since 1980 of U.S. presidents talking with their Mexican counterparts before being sworn in to underscore the special relationship between the two nations. Obama arrived in the Mexican capital after an unannounced trip to Haiti. She was accompanied on the trip by Jill Biden, wife of Vice President Joe Biden. They arrived in the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince by mid-morning and took a helicopter tour of the earthquake-shattered Haitian capital. ""It's powerful. The devastation is definitely powerful,"" Obama said after the tour. The magnitude-7.0 earthquake on January 12 demolished large swaths of Port-au-Prince and left more than 1 million people homeless. Many are still living in tents and underneath tarps. Obama and Biden also met with Haitian President Rene Preval and his wife, Elisabeth Delatour Preval. The U.S. delegation made the visit ""to underscore to the Haitian people and the Haitian government the enduring U.S. commitment to help Haiti recover and rebuild, especially as we enter the rainy and hurricane seasons, and to thank the women and men across the whole of the U.S. government for their extraordinary efforts in Haiti during the past three months,"" the White House said in a statement. Obama and Biden ""will also reach out to the U.N. and international relief communities in recognition of the truly global effort under way to help Haiti,"" the White House said.","NEW: Obama's Mexico visit billed as ""recognition of the (nations') deep ties""

"Rome (CNN) -- Pope Francis will officially be inaugurated Tuesday as the leader of the world's 1.2-billion member Catholic Church. Here's what will happen at and around the Installation Mass: . 8:45-8:50 a.m. (3:45-3:50 a.m. ET) Pope Francis leaves the Santa Marta residence, where cardinals stayed for the conclave and where he is living until the papal apartments are ready. He travels to St Peter's Square, where the Inauguration Mass will take place. About 9:30 a.m. (4:30 a.m. ET) The pope arrives at St Peter's Square Sacristy (the steps area). He will enter St Peter's Basilica. He will visit St. Peter's tomb inside St. Peter's Basilica. He will be accompanied by the patriarchs of Catholic Oriental Churches, for a total of 10 people. The pope will pray there. In the tomb, deacons of the Church will collect two symbols of the papacy -- the fisherman's ring and the pallium. From the tomb, the pope and cardinals will go in procession through the Basilica and into the Square, accompanied by the processional chant ""Laudes Regiae."" (""Christ is King"") The deacons will carry the ring and pallium into St. Peter's Square. Catholic tradition holds that St. Peter was martyred in the square, which was Nero's Circus. Before the Mass starts, Cardinal Jean-Louis Tauran -- the protodeacon who announced the name of the new pope after white smoke last week -- ceremonially presents Pope Francis with the pallium. Cardinal Godfried Danneels -- the second-ranking cardinal among cardinal deacons, known as the protopriest --d elivers a prayer. Cardinal Angelo Sodano, the dean of the College of Cardinals, gives the fisherman's ring to Pope Francis. Six cardinals representing the College of Cardinals (2 cardinals per order) take the pledge of obedience. About 10:00 a.m. (5 a.m. ET) Inauguration Mass begins. It will be the Mass for St. Joseph's Day (officially called the Solemnity of St. Joseph). The Gospel reading will be in Greek. Five hundred priests will hand out Communion in St. Peter's Square and in Via Conciliazione (the road leading straight out from the Vatican towards the Castel Sant'Angelo liveshot location.) The pope will have 180 co-celebrants for the Mass including all the cardinals still in Rome (electors and non), the patriarchs, and also two priests: the Jesuit Superior General and the Franciscan order Superior General. The pope will give his homily in Italian and, as is his style, it probably will not follow the written text strictly, but will contain improvisations. 11:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m. ET) The Mass is expected to wrap up. ""Te Deum"" is to be sung at the conclusion. After 11:30 a.m. (6:30 a.m. ET) After the the Mass, the Pope will return to the Basilica and remove his vestment at the altar of the Pieta. He will proceed at Main altar where he'll receive dignitaries and heads of state.","Pope Francis starts at the residence where he was for the conclave .

"(CNN) -- Rock singer Sammy Hagar, a little older since his Van Halen days but still featuring bountiful blond curls, touted single moms, family and sex Monday night on the premiere of HLN's ""Dr. Drew."" But for Van Halen fans, Hagar's memories of the band and how he would like to regain a friendship with Eddie Van Halen may have been the biggest draw. ""The greatest part of my musical career was being in Van Halen,"" said Hagar, who described to Dr. Drew Pinsky the alcoholism in his father and former bandmates. One of the band members, Hagar said, went into rehab and got clean, but ""Eddie keeps falling down and would be in denial."" Hagar, 63, claims Eddie Van Halen, who he says is doing better these days, is perhaps jealous of his success since leaving the band, a power hard rock mainstay of the 1980s and 1990s. ""They threw me out of the band, and they haven't done anything since 18 years later,"" said Hagar, author of a bestseller ""Red: My Uncensored Life in Rock."" ""He's got the biggest heart in the world,"" Hagar said of Eddie Van Halen. In other comments, Hagar: . -- Recalled dreaming as a young man about an alien encounter, with blue beings and beams of light. ""You can call me crazy all you want. Anyone who says we are the only life in this whole vast universe, they are crazy."" -- Admitted to many sexual consorts during his days on the road and between marriages. Now, ""I chase my wife around the house."" -- Talked about being raised by a single mother in an abusive marriage. ""My mother made me feel love."" -- He also spoke about his father who he said died in the back of a police car.""Because of my father I am very sensitive to it,"" Hagar said of alcoholism. -- Touted old-fashioned hard work. ""I was willing to work my butt off for anything I could achieve,"" Hagar said. ""I came from nothing."" Pinsky, who has been a physician for 30 years, opened the show with an answer to critics who say he can't diagnose at a distance. ""I have studied thousands of cases ... It's what I do.""

"(CNN) -- On October 20, 2001, a concert was held in Madison Square Garden to benefit the victims of the 9/11 terrorist attacks. On stage were some of the biggest names in show business. In the audience were first responders who had been working around the clock at ground zero. To those watching on television, the most memorable thing about the evening was not the performers on stage. It was the faces of those in the crowd. The firemen. The paramedics. The police officers. They were smiling. They were laughing. Some of them were in tears. For the first time in weeks, it seemed, they had set aside their anguish and were having a good time. By far, though, the emotional high point of the evening came when The Who took the stage toward the end of the night. After opening with ""Who Are You"" and following that with ""Baba O'Riley,"" the band played ""Won't Get Fooled Again."" At that moment, a different mood seemed to take hold across the room. The anguish turned to anger and the remorse turned to resolve. And as Roger Daltrey let out a guttural scream to conclude the song, the crowd, as if one, raised their fists in the air and let out a scream of their own: . ""WE WON'T GET FOOLED AGAIN!!"" At that same moment, one could almost picture President Bush watching from the residence at the White House doing the same thing. After all, he was by all accounts briefed less than two months earlier that Osama bin Laden was planning to launch an attack on the United States. If anyone was fooled on 9/11, it was most assuredly him. And if anyone had reason to vow to never let something like this happen again, it was the one individual who took an oath to keep this nation secure. Three years later, the Brooks and Dunn anthem ""Only in America"" would often be cited as the unofficial song of the 2004 Bush re-election campaign. Yet looking back on it now, one could argue that a more appropriate song for the Bush administration was the anthem The Who played that October Saturday night. The song not only defined Bush's time in office in the years following 9/11, but also provided a lens through which nearly every policy decision could be viewed. The decision to invade Iraq is a good example. The wisdom of invading this country is still being debated, but the rationale behind the decision to do so was clear: Saddam Hussein claimed he had weapons of mass destruction, and most of the world's leading intelligence agencies claimed he had them, as well. In light of the fact that he had ignored intelligence reports before 9/11, it is understandable that Bush did not want to make the same mistake again. Critics say that he overreacted, and in light of the fact that WMDs were never found, they are correct. But as California Sen. Dianne Feinstein recently stated, ""I'd rather, in the interest of protecting people, overreact rather than underreact."" Feinstein's statement is notable not because it was aimed at President Bush, but because it was aimed at President Obama. Specifically, it was aimed at the underwhelming response of the Obama administration to the failed attempt to blow up a U.S. passenger jet on Christmas Day. It also points to a larger problem facing the president as he begins his second year in office -- namely, the fact that the failures of 9/11 seem to have been forgotten by his administration and his allies on Capitol Hill. First, members of the intelligence community failed to connect the dots that would have flagged the young Nigerian bomber as a potential terrorist and prevented him from getting on the plane. Then, federal law enforcement officials decided to treat the bomber as a common criminal instead of an enemy combatant, giving greater priority to finding him an attorney than getting to the bottom of this evil plot. The administration now reports the would-be bomber is cooperating and providing useful information. That may be true. But it's also true that we are engaged in a conflict that cannot be litigated. We are fighting a war, not fighting crime. This is why Congress and the president established a military commission process in the years following 9/11 to deal with terrorist threats of this nature. It's also why Attorney General Eric Holder, in the face of protests by Mayor Michael Bloomberg and other local officials, is backing off plans to prosecute accused 9/11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammad in a federal court in New York City. To make matters worse, it's not just the Obama administration that is failing to heed the lessons of 9/11. The Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill also appears to have forgotten the failures of that day. For example, one of the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission was that Congress streamline committee oversight with regard to homeland security. The reason is simple. In 2007 and 2008, officials from the Homeland Security Department appeared at more than 370 hearings and gave more than 5,000 briefings to staffers and members from 108 committees. Despite this jurisdictional nightmare, the leadership remains resistant to reform. Hopefully, it won't take another 9/11 for the president and his allies to regain their sense of urgency and prepare for another attack. We know it's coming. According to Dennis Blair, the director of national intelligence, an attack could come in the next six months. Security is being heightened at numerous public events as a result. That includes this weekend's Super Bowl, where The Who will be performing at halftime. President Obama will no doubt be watching the game. When The Who takes the stage, if he is watching their performance, let's hope he hears the same message first responders heard during the concert at Madison Square Garden in 2001. Let's hope we don't get fooled again. To view a clip of The Who's performance at Madison Square Garden on October 20, 2001, click here .

"(CNN) -- An Ohio grand jury on Friday indicted a 52-year-old man, alleging that he ""pulled the trigger"" to kill three men who had answered a Craigslist ad for work on a cattle farm, authorities said. Richard Beasley faces multiple counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery as well as a host of other charges, according to the 28-page indictment released Friday by the Summit County prosecutor's office. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine acknowledged there may be more victims, and thus more charges. ""We are dealing with serial killings here,"" DeWine told reporters, pleading for the public to provide more information. ""Are there more bodies? Frankly, we don't know. If there are, we need to find them."" As outlined in the indictment, Beasley is the ""principal offender"" in the murders of three men between August and November 2011, Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said. He could be eligible for the death penalty if convicted, given that the murders could meet one or more requirements for that sentence including purposely causing the death of two or more people and murdering people while a fugitive, committing a kidnapping and/or committing armed robbery. ""This case deserves the death penalty for a multitude of reasons,"" Walsh said. ""This case, we view to be one of the worst of the worst when it comes to horrible murder cases."" Beasley will be formally arraigned on the charges next Wednesday morning, prosecutor's office spokeswoman April Wiesner told CNN affiliate WJW by e-mail. He has been in custody at the Summit County jail since November 16, 2011, on unrelated charges -- including drug trafficking and promoting prostitution -- according to jail records posted online. The victims -- Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron, Ohio; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio -- were found dead in separate shallow graves after responding to an online ad soliciting workers, authorities have said. The investigation into the killings began the night of November 6, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a ""white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm,"" according to Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum of Noble County. The wounded man -- who was identified in the indictment as Scott Davis, 48, from South Carolina -- told the law enforcement officer that he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio. He met with two males, including Beasley, and drove with them toward Stock Township, Ohio. After being told a road was closed due to a landslide, Davis got out of the car to start walking toward the property, which he was told was nearby. Davis told the sheriff that, while walking through a heavily wooded area, he turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head. He deflected the gun and ran"" -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing, the sheriff explained late last year. The victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help, Hannum said. ""Davis lived to tell the tale, but as his story got out, more information came forward about other missing persons who had answered similar Craigslist ads,"" said DeWine, speaking at Friday's news conference with Walsh. The third victim, Kern, was killed one week after Davis's escape, according to authorities. The attorney general said that the victims were all ""down on their luck"" men trying to take advantage of an opportunity to ""have a better life."" ""Tragically, it ended in their deaths,"" he added. Brogan Rafferty, 16, of Stow, Ohio, who is a high school sophomore, is facing charges of aggravated murder and attempted murder in connection with the killings, and prosecutors are seeking to try him as an adult, according to CNN affiliates WKYC and WJW. Rafferty's father, Michael, told WJW in late November that his son had been ""manipulated"" and ""corrupted,"" insisting that the teenager is a ""mild-mannered gentleman."" The father also said that his son unwittingly dug the graves at Beasley's direction, WJW reported. The boy's mother said her son denied killing anyone and added that Beasley portrayed himself as ""a chaplain"" who gave food to the homeless. Walsh, the Summit County prosecutor, noted Friday that the judge had imposed a ""gag order"" in that case, ""so we cannot give any comments."" As to Beasley, he will be arraigned on 27 counts -- including, besides the aggravated murder charges, four for aggravated robbery, four for kidnapping, two for grand theft and one for identity fraud -- according to the indictment. DeWine said the case should serve as a ""warning"" about the potential perils of the Internet. He noted that while there are many legitimate uses for the classified website, ""many people ... use Craigslist for horrible reasons."" ""I'm shocked and I'm sickened by how technology and the Internet were used in this case to draw in vulnerable people and then execute them,"" he said. CNN's John Fricke and Rich Porter contributed to this report.","NEW: Calling it ""the worst of the worst,"" a prosecutor says the case merits a death penalty .

"(CNN) -- It was at San Francisco's Olympic Club that ""Gentleman Jim"" Corbett, world heavyweight champion and to many the man who took boxing from a brawl to an art, trained and coached. Twenty-two years after his death, the sports club hosted its first U.S. Open golf tournament in 1955. Ben Hogan lost in a playoff to an unknown golf pro from Iowa and the course was on its way to developing a reputation as the graveyard of champions. Now, after four U.S. Opens there, the first rule of Olympic Club favorites is ... there are no Olympic Club favorites. That's more true than ever this time around. It remains to be seen whether we're in the post-Tiger Woods era or just an interregnum in his reign, but what's certainly the case is that these days a large number of players turn up at major championships with a genuine belief and chance of winning. One simple fact supports them: the last 14 majors have been won by 14 different players. It was very different back at that first Olympic U.S. Open. Then, Ben Hogan was the man. Nine major championships under his belt and already the subject of a Hollywood movie, Hogan went to San Francisco in search of his fifth U.S. Open. He seemed to have won it too: the TV commentator congratulated him on his victory and the broadcast went off air proclaiming Hogan as U.S. Open champion. Rather inconveniently, Jack Fleck, a pro from a municipal course in Iowa, birdied 15 and 18, forced Hogan into a playoff and then -- in one of the greatest sporting upsets of all time -- beat the great man by three shots. Olympic's reputation was cemented 11 years later when that era's superstar, Arnold Palmer, held a seven-shot lead over Billy Casper as he began the final nine holes. Against all odds, Casper drew level with Arnie to take the tournament to another playoff, and again it was the underdog who emerged as U.S. Open champion. Scott Simpson's victory over Tom Watson in 1987 and Lee Janzen's 1998 triumph over Payne Stewart in the next two U.S. Opens at Olympic merely confirmed the club as one where nothing could be taken for granted. Of course, the bookmakers have their favorite -- and the way Tiger Woods birdied three of the last four holes to win the Memorial at Muirfield Village two weeks ago convinced many that his time has come again, that he can move to within three wins of Jack Nicklaus' record 18 majors. The more cautious point out that his victory at Bay Hill earlier this season was followed by a disappointing performance in the Masters. Can Tiger consistently hit fairways and stay away from the Lake course's many thousands of tall trees? Will his putting stand up to the severe test of Olympic's greens? Only four days of championship play will let us know. He tied for 18th here in 1998, but revealed he has had to start a new course book due to all the changes made since then. On this month's Living Golf show, Nicklaus pointed out that while he had no idea how close he was to Bobby Jones' then record in the majors until a journalist pointed it out, Tiger has had Jack's record in front of him from his very first Masters. In fact, at the beginning of last season, our presenter Shane O'Donoghue asked Tiger if it was equaling Jack's record that drove him on. ""I'm not looking to equal it,"" shot back Tiger with a steely non-smile. Nicklaus, sitting alongside Rory McIlroy for a special joint interview, also suggested that the 23-year-old defending champion could be the one to break his record. There will be more money on Rory to make it three in a row for Northern Ireland since golf's poster-boy took Jack's advice and practiced at Olympic last week, and his high ball flight should help with those approaches to tricky greens. But the last man to win back-to-back U.S. Opens was Curtis Strange more than 20 years ago. History is also against Dustin Johnson -- no-one has ever won a U.S. Open after winning the week before -- but then again he's a man rested (after injury), on form after his Memphis triumph and with the length to leave himself more lofted clubs to those slick, well-guarded putting surfaces. When world-renowned coach Butch Harmon tells you that Johnson is a major champion waiting to happen, maybe history should take a backseat. Last year at Congressional the heavens opened and softened all the greens, allowing the bold to fire at pins in a most un-U.S. Open style. This week the forecast is for dry weather -- and with San Francisco's breeze quickening those small greens even further, the one near-certainty is that we won't be seeing a repeat of Rory's 16 under par. No-one is going to stroll round the Lake course accumulating birdies. As the USGA's executive director Mike Davis puts it, balls will roll, and Olympic's numerous bunkers are likely to see a lot of traffic. In short, no-one with any sense can have much confidence trying to pick a winner this week. The truth is that every one of the 156 players in the field has a chance of lifting that trophy. The history of Olympic, at least, tells them that. But if you're looking to try to narrow things down a bit, it makes sense to look at patient, calm, in-form players with solid putting strokes and a mastery of the short game. So four names who cover at least most of those bases are: Johnson, 2011 Masters champion Charl Schwartzel, Jason Dufner -- a two-time winner on the PGA Tour this season --and world No. 1 Luke Donald. They may finish as the top four, they may miss the cut. It's not often that picking the top-ranked player is high risk, but then this is the U.S. Open at Olympic.","San Francisco's Olympic Club has earned a reputation as the graveyard of champions .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A car theft in China that spiraled into a manhunt and a baby's killing has left the country grieving and sparked outrage on social media. The body of the infant, whose name was Haobo, was found buried in the snow Wednesday. His father, Xu Jialin, said he and his wife identified their two-month-old son, according to state-run news agency Xinhua. Thousands gathered in a square Tuesday night in Changchun, the capital of Jilin Province, to mourn the baby, killed by ""a thief who found the missing boy sleeping in a car he had stolen,"" Xinhua reported. The 48-year-old man, identified as Zhou Xijun, turned himself in to police Tuesday and confessed that he had killed the baby and buried him in the snow, Xinhua reported, citing local police. Xu, the father, had parked his car Monday in front of the supermarket he runs in Changchun and entered the store to turn on a stove, leaving his son in the back seat with the car's engine still running, according to state-run news reports. Xu returned minutes later to find his car was missing. He called police immediately. Zhou had allegedly stolen the grey Toyota SUV and discovered the child on the backseat as he drove the vehicle away. More than 8,000 police and hundreds of volunteers joined a search for the child for two days. Zhou has confessed ""that he parked the car on the roadside and choked the baby about an hour after he stole the car. He then abandoned the baby's clothes and the car in the nearby city of Gongzhuling,"" Xinhua reported. The car's license plate and the child's clothes were found in a ditch 500 meters away from the car. Fury on social media . News of the murder provoked a storm of anger on Chinese social media, particularly Weibo, the country's version of Twitter. While many people demanded the death penalty for Zhou, others questioned why the baby had been left in the car. ""What kind of people will leave their babies alone in cars?"" asked @Qiyanhenxiaozhang. ""The parents abandoned their children. When they leave their baby in the car, they should know something bad might happen,"" posted @Lingluandabaomaoyeye. Some pointed the finger at the media. ""Everywhere is posting information about the baby, and they irritated the killer and provoked his desperate act. The media has done a really bad work,"" said Shenshang. ""The media surely has the rights to spread information, but they should consider the baby's safety as well,"" said another netizen, @zhongguorenshidiqiushangdeqiji. Anger over car ad . Another twist has led to widespread anger at a car dealership that used the incident to push the features of its vehicles. A Buick dealership cited the Baby Haobo incident -- before it was known that the child had been killed -- to advertise its OnStar GPS system, which allows the owner ""to track and lock down a stolen vehicle at any time and place."" Some people followed up with social media posts saying they won't buy a Buick. The Buick dealership, Liaoning Tianhe, apologized on Weibo to the family of the victim and to the public for the ""emotional damage"" it caused. CNN's Feng Ke and Dayu Zhang in Beijing contributed to this report.","The body of Baby Haobo was found Wednesday .

"(CNN) -- Engines rev up Sunday for the start of the 2013 NASCAR season with the 55th running of the Daytona 500, stock car racing's biggest event. But for one driver, the race is about more than a possible trip to victory lane. Michael Waltrip is racing for Sandy Hook. The events of December 14 left most of America stunned and clutching their children a little tighter. The loss of 20 children and six employees at the Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school united people in grief across the globe, many of whom had an immediate desire to help. NASCAR President Mike Helton was among those. He knew that his stock car racing family had to act. Two-time Daytona winner Waltrip said Helton called him up and said, ""I've got something I think we should do for the Daytona 500."" Helton, Waltrip and Swan Racing -- the team Waltrip will drive for in Sunday's race -- had a private meeting with Newtown officials, community leaders, first responders and victims' families in early February. At a February 14 event in Daytona Beach, Florida, it was announced that Waltrip's car number 30 would be changed to 26 and his colors would be green and white to honor those lost. There will also be a message on the car, ""Text Newtown to 80888,"" for fans to make a $10 donation to the Sandy Hook School Support Fund, which was established by the United Way of Western Connecticut and Newtown Savings Bank. NASCAR says 100% of the funds raised will go directly to help meet the needs of the Newtown community. Those needs are two-fold, according to Waltrip. First, he said he hopes having a personal connection to the race will give the townspeople a boost, even if momentarily. A city official ""told me that after that meeting she'd seen smiles on some people's faces that she hadn't seen since the devastating events of December 14. So on Sunday for a little bit of time at least, I think the town can escape reality and enjoy one of the greatest sporting events in the world with something to root for,"" Waltrip said. ""And secondly who knows what kind of therapy and recovery the children and schoolteachers and the people of the town will need going forward. So it's going to be a lot of money for counseling and helping people through that day and who knows what all the money could be used for -- a memorial, a new school. ... We just want to make sure that there's always money there to help people in need."" Waltrip also owns a racing team, Michael Waltrip Racing, and all three of his drivers entered in Sunday's race -- Clint Bowyer in No. 15, Mark Martin in No. 55 and Martin Truex Jr. in No. 56 -- will have decals on their cars to support the cause. ""We're ready to go racing, ready to put some smiles on faces and raise money,"" Waltrip said, who also is tweeting information about the campaign drive. Donations have already started coming in, Waltrip said. NASCAR Chairman and CEO Brian France and his wife, Amy, pledged a personal donation of $50,000, and the NASCAR Foundation has matched that donation, according to Waltrip. ""Looking out at a room of smiling faces amidst the aftermath of a horrible tragedy was very powerful,"" France said. ""It hit me that the NASCAR industry and our passionate fan base have an unbelievable opportunity to rally around this cause and make a huge difference."" Waltrip is counting on fans when he climbs into his car Sunday afternoon, and he said he has faith his extended family will come through for the people of Newtown. ""I think you see it all the time and that's the reason why we do it because they (fans) respond, they support. They want to help worthy causes as well so we rely on that 75 million people in our fan base to step up when we have a great cause. And that's what makes it so special that the fans really appreciate what we do and they really want to be a part of it."" He added, ""Driving the No. 26 Sandy Hook School Support Fund Toyota is like nothing I have ever been part of in my NASCAR career. It will be an emotional week knowing that we have the potential to do so much good for the Newtown community. I'm racing for a reason."" Donations also can be made online or by mail: .

"(CNN) -- NEWS FLASH: Working mom leaves office at 5:30 to spend time with kids. Sadly, this is newsworthy, especially when the mom in question is Sheryl Sandberg, the chief operating officer of Facebook. By outing herself and urging others to follow her lead, Sandberg did us all a great service. Her announcement is an important step in normalizing and destigmatizing flexible work practices that should be prevailing practices, not exceptions. Welcome as her announcement is, it also offers a cautionary tale. While she's been leaving at 5:30 since her children were born, or about seven years, it's only in the last two years, she says, that she's been ""brave enough to talk about it publicly."" Despite the fact that the vast majority of women, especially professional women like Sandberg, combine careers and kids, the dirty little secret of today's workplace is that it still takes bravery -- and perhaps being the COO -- to be able to talk openly about leaving at the end of the day. It's hard to imagine that Sandberg, a woman whose career has taken her from Harvard to Treasury to Google to second-in-command at Facebook, is easily cowed. She may not be every woman, but her fear of the consequences of being found out is shared by far too many working moms. Unfortunately, their fears appear to be well-grounded. Sandberg is the exception who proves the rule. Pete Cashmore: Why it's OK to leave a tech job at 5 p.m. Judged against powerful professional time norms, where long hours and constant availability are taken as proxies for commitment and competence (despite evidence to the contrary), Sandberg is what sociologists would call a ""time deviant,"" which is anyone who works other than full-time plus. This includes leaving ""early"" or working part-time or job-sharing. Research shows that working flexibly is a career killer whatever your gender, but women, especially mothers, who are more likely to take advantage of flexible options, face a double penalty: one for working flexibly; another simply for being a mother. Both translate in to dead ends and reduced pay. That's for those who continue working, but often overlooked are the approximately 25% to 30% who don't, instead interrupting and sometimes terminating their careers. While this group is popularly understood as having ""opted out,"" in my research I found that their ""options"" typically consisted of working all or nothing, and that their decisions to quit were reluctant and conflicted. As a former management consultant told me about her employer: ""What they really wanted you to do was bust your ass, and if there was anything that was going to get in the way of doing that, then you completely became chopped liver."" For these women, most of whom never envisioned having to choose between careers and children, the costs of workplace inflexibility are up close and personal -- diverted dreams and forgone earnings and independence. As a society, we bear the larger costs, when their workplace exits deprive us of much needed talent and drain the pipeline of future women leaders. Sandberg's clandestine ""early"" leave-taking was a private solution to a public problem. Like so many women, she found a way to make work work. Too often, the ability to work flexibly is a perk, an extra, something for high fliers that has to be earned, or something that's on the books, but only approved in special cases. It's not a best practice and certainly not a right. Yet, as a report from the Council of Economic Advisers, commissioned for a 2010 White House Forum on Workplace Flexibility, shows, flexibility is a best practice. Among its many benefits are increased productivity, reduced turnover and absenteeism, and higher morale and company commitment. Many European countries know this and are well ahead of us in creating the flexible workplaces of the 21st century, while ours remain so last-century. By being candid about her own experiences, Sandberg's admission can help us recognize and begin to chip away at the penalties linked to flexibility, borne disproportionately by women. I'm part of a working group, led by lawyer/author Joan Williams at UC-Hastings School of Law's Center for WorkLife Law, which seeks to do the same, by documenting this emerging new form of discrimination and identifying potential legal remedies. Sandberg's announcement reminds us, too, of how little we're asking for when we ask for flexibility -- things like getting home to have dinner with our families or take an ailing parent to the doctor. We know that workers of all kinds, ages and genders want more control over how and where they work so they can have a life, with or without family. Yet until we lift the stigma and penalty attached to flexible work arrangements, we can anticipate that workers will be wary of taking advantage of them. Sheryl Sandberg has started an important conversation, one that encourages more of us to ask for flexibility and emboldens us to talk about it. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Pamela Stone.","Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg says she leaves work at 5:30 p.m. to spend time with kids .

"(CNN) -- A report in South Korean media is fueling the ongoing speculation about the deteriorating health of North Korean leader Kim Jong Il. Kim Jong Il, seen in an undated state-issued photo, has made only two public appearances since August. YTN News, citing unidentified intelligence sources in South Korea and China, reported Monday that the 67-year-old leader has pancreatic cancer. South Korea's Unification Ministry flatly denied the report, which comes a week after a frail-looking Kim appeared in public for the first time in months. Doctors told South Korea's state-run Yonhap News Agency that it is impossible to tell the status of Kim's health from the recent video of the reclusive leader. Kim appeared at a July 8 ceremony to commemorate the 15th anniversary of his father's death. He seemed frail and gaunt as he walked into the service flanked by senior party and military officials. North Korea's official KCNA news agency has routinely criticized the Western media for erroneously exaggerating the status of Kim's health. Last week's appearance was his second since he was widely reported to have suffered a stroke in August. Kim was seen in April when he was reappointed as chairman of North Korea's military board. His recent health problems and long absence from public functions have prompted speculation on whether he was ready to groom an heir. The rules governing transfer of power in the secretive communist nation are unclear, but it is widely believed that Kim's youngest son, Kim Jong Un, will succeed him.  Facts about North Korea » . In April, the North Korean leader named Kim Jong Un and brother-in-law Chang Sung Taek to the country's powerful National Defense Commission. Chang, who is married to Kim Jong Il's sister, has effectively run the country in the wake of the leader's health problems, according to TIME Magazine. Chang is ""the bridge from Kim Jong Il to Kim Jong Un,"" according to Baek Seung Joo, who watches North Korea at the Korea Institute for Defense Analysis, who spoke to TIME Magazine last month.","Media reports, citing unconfirmed sources, say Kim Jong Il has cancer .

"(CNN) -- The story was the same that Fernando Torres has been writing ever since he joined Chelsea from Liverpool for the enormous sum of Â£50 million ($80 million) in January 2011. Having secured Chelsea's passage to the Europa League quarterfinals by scoring the goal that ultimately knocked out Romania's Steaua Bucharest, Torres then had the chance to embellish a rare display of confidence with a late penalty. Could this be the moment that the Spaniard, who looked unusually fired up after being denied what he thought was a penalty before then suffering a bloodied nose, finally began to feel settled at Stamford Bridge? For those who have followed Torres' stop-start Blues career, the scenario was all too familiar as he crashed his 86th minute penalty against the crossbar - before looking to the heavens in despair. That he was even prepared to take the penalty told its own story for a man who can boast World Cup and European Championship medals is not known for his prowess nor confidence from the spot. Indeed, when he stepped up against Sunderland in a 3-1 league win at the Stadium of Light last December, the successful effort was -- remarkably -- the first he had ever scored in the Premier League since arriving in 2007. With reports surfacing of Torres having turned down the chance to join big-spending Russian side Anzhi Makhachkala, this seemed the chance for the striker, who celebrates his 29th birthday next week, to banish his woes and restore that absent friend of his: confidence. But as the ball cannoned against the woodwork, the former Atletico Madrid star may have felt that there is an invisible barrier blocking his path at Chelsea. ""He was working hard and he took his chance great -- but obviously, it's a pity that the penalty didn't go in for him,"" said Chelsea goalkeeper Petr Cech. Nonetheless, Torres' strike in the 71st minute was enough to see Chelsea through on a tense night -- meaning the Blues stay on course to become the first side to win UEFA's top two club competitions in reverse order in successive seasons. Trailing 1-0 from the first leg in the Romanian capital, Rafa Benitez's side leveled matters as Juan Mata squeezed the ball home after 33 minutes -- but Vlad Chiriches' equalizer (and away goal) on the stroke of half time gave the game a very different complexion. Making a rare start after a season disrupted by knee problems, captain John Terry restored Chelsea's lead before Torres scored only his second goal in 20 games to register a 3-2 aggregate win. The victory capped a productive night for English clubs as Chelsea, Tottenham and Newcastle managed to partly atone for the failure of their Premier League counterparts in the Champions League -- none of whom made it into the last eight. Spurs were involved in the day's most dramatic game as they took a 3-0 lead to Inter Milan -- only to find themselves level on aggregate after 90 minutes as the rampant Italians scored through the lively Antonio Cassano, Rodrigo Palacio and a William Gallas own goal. But six minutes into extra-time, the previously quiet Emmanuel Adebayor silenced Inter's fans when poking home a vital away goal. The Togolese boasted the unusual record of having scored for Spurs against Inter at the same San Siro stadium where he had netted for Arsenal against AC Milan -- a rare feat -- but this was a mere aside when Alvarez made it 4-4 on aggregate with ten minutes to go. But Tottenham -- who badly missed the suspended Gareth Bale -- held on, to leave coach Andre Villas-Boas with the chance of repeating the 2011 Europa League triumph he achieved with Porto. ""We have learned massively from our last two ties in the competition, against Lyon and Inter,"" said the visibly-drained 35-year-old after the game. While Spurs hung on for victory, Newcastle achieved theirs deep in stoppage time as Papiss Demba Cisse headed home -- at home -- against Anzhi Makhachkala for a 1-0 aggregate win. Russian clubs had a mixed night with Rubin Kazan winning 2-0 at home against Levante, but only after extra-time, while Zenit St Petersburg went out against Basel, beaten 2-1 on aggregate after Roman Shirokov failed to score an 86th-minute penalty that would have taken the game into extra-time. Elsewhere, Libor Kozak scored a hat-trick as Lazio completed a comfortable 5-1 aggregate win over Stuttgart with a 3-1 win in Rome while Portugal's Benfica, one of the strongest teams left in the Europa League, knocked out Bordeaux 4-2. Fenerbahce joined Champions League quarterfinalists Galatasaray in extending Istanbul's interest in European competition as they completed a 2-1 aggregate win over Czech side Viktoria Plzen.","Chelsea overturn first leg deficit to beat Steaua Bucharest and reach last eight .

"(CNN) -- He walked down the red carpet and left to a standing ovation -- it seems David Beckham continues to write his own script. After his cameo performance for Paris Saint-Germain last Sunday, Beckham played 86 minutes of his side's 2-0 win over Marseille in the French Cup Wednesday. The 37-year-old, who signed a five month deal with the club in January, showed he still has the fitness to compete at the top level with an impressive performance. Beckham plays classic cameo role . Not even a yellow card for the former England captain could tarnish the evening as Zlatan Ibrahimovic's double sent PSG through to the last eight. After entering the stadium via an Oscar like red carpet parade, Beckham started in midfield against the team he faced in the league just days ago. Beckham 'excited' On that occasion, he managed just 14 minutes, but manager Carlo Ancelotti gave the player every opportunity to impress. And while he displayed his characteristic style of passing, it was a through ball from Clement Chantome which released Ibrahimovic to fire home a 35th minute opener. The Swede grabbed his second 19 minutes into the second half, slotting home from the penalty spot to wrap up a comfortable victory. In Spain's Copa del Rey, Atletico Madrid booked its place in the final against city rival Real Madrid thanks to a 2-2 draw at Sevilla. Atletico, which is second in the league under manager Diego Simeone, arrived protecting a 2-1 lead from the first leg. And it quickly got into its stride with just six minutes gone when Diego Costa's fierce effort flew into the corner from 20-yards. Sevilla was facing an uphill task and that was increased further when Radamel Falcao swept home from close range with 29 minutes on the clock. But the home side refused to buckle and Jesus Navas produced a wonderful curling effort to reduce the deficit before the interval. Costa should have ended the contest on 54 minutes but somehow slid his effort wide of the far post when he looked certain to score. Sevilla had chances of its own with Alvaro Negredo also going close, before Ivan Rakitic's late strike made it 2-2 on the night, but it was not enough as the visitor progressed 4-3 on aggregate. Arsenal blown away by Bayern . In the German Cup, Bayern Munich continued its impressive run of form to make the last four after it overcame Borussia Dortmund 1-0 thanks to an Arjen Robben strike. Robben's goal sealed Bayern's first triumph over Dortmund in three years following a run of six games without a win going back to February 2010. Meanwhile, UEFA has dismissed Schalke's protest over the eligibility of Galatasaray striker Didier Drogba to play in the Champions League. ""Having examined all the documents of the case, the Control and Disciplinary Body decided to reject the protest lodged by Schalke,"" said a UEFA statement. The German side had claimed that the former Chelsea striker had not been registered in time to qualify for the knockout phase of the competition. Drogba, 34, made his European debut for the Turkish club during the last 16 first leg tie on February 20 which finished 1-1. Had Galatasaray been found guilty of fielding an ineligible player, it would have been handed a 3-0 deficit going into the second leg in Gelsenkirchen on March 12. Elsewhere, Lazio was fined $52,500 and ordered to play their next two home games in Europe behind closed doors. The punishment comes after its fans were accused of throwing fireworks and displaying racist behavior in the Europa League contest against Borussia Moenchengladbach on February 21. That means the Italian club will play Stuttgart on March 14 behind closed doors as well as its next home tie. Arsenal has announced that it will unveil a statue of Dennis Bergkamp in honor of the former striker's contribution to the club. Bergkamp, who scored 120 goals in 423 appearances for the club following his move from Inter Milan in 1995, said: ""Everyone knows that I love Arsenal and that I had a fantastic time at the club.

"(Financial Times) -- The sales director for a supplier to Beijing Foton Daimler Automotive is close to despair. She has been selling parts for 20 years but now, she said, more people than ever needed to be bribed to guarantee orders. ""In the past, we would give a purchasing manager a red envelope. But now even assembly line workers will call me threatening that if we don't pay up they will find some problem with our product,"" she said, asking to remain anonymous for fear of the potential consequences. ""The rot has reached the roots."" Her exasperation is shared by many. China is gripped by a sense that corruption has never been as bad as it is today and that it has started to shake the very foundations of the country's economic development. Xi Jinping, who became president on Thursday, has been driving an anti-graft campaign ever since he took over as Communist party chief in November. Mr Xi identified fighting corruption as a priority in his first speech as leader and has promised to show no leniency over an issue that he and others have warned could be a threat to the party's rule. Beijing has subsequently cracked down on the flood of gifts and banquets from which even small-time party officials have benefited. And, at the annual session of the National People's Congress, the rubber-stamp parliament that has been meeting in Beijing this week, Mr Xi's approach has raised hopes that tougher rhetoric will translate into systemic reform. ""We have received indications that the National People's Congress Standing Committee will put a broad anti-corruption law on its legislative agenda for the coming five years,"" said Dennis Han, an NPC delegate and long-time campaigner for legislation to force officials to publicly declare their assets. But the problem runs far beyond officialdom. According to Transparency International, Chinese people say corruption is at its worst in the private sector. In the group's 2010/2011 Global Corruption Barometer, the sector scored worse than the civil service, judiciary or the police. Daimler did not respond to requests for comment about the claims made by the supplier's sales director about its Chinese joint venture. The executive said her company gave her Rmb20,000 ($3,300) for handouts during lunar new year, when cash gifts in red envelopes is traditionally given in a practice often used as a cloak for bribery. Even so, she said, she struggled to meet the ballooning demand for new year gifts from even lowly employees at the Daimler joint venture on the outskirts of Beijing. ""The Germans only occupy the top layer of management, and everything below that is done by Chinese, the Chinese way. The Germans don't know,"" she said. Although China has many laws and regulations banning corruption, the country has long struggled to contain it among officials. Lang Sheng, deputy head of the NPC's law committee, said further anti-corruption legislation would be one of the focal points of the congress's work in the coming years. Plenty of people remain sceptical about the party's willingness to root out corruption. A bout of transparency would be likely to reveal graft at the very top of the party and Beijing has reacted angrily in recent months to scrutiny by international news organisations, including Bloomberg and the New York Times, of the wealth of Mr Xi's family and that of Wen Jiabao, the outgoing premier. Reformists are not giving up, however. Mr Han failed for seven years in a row to get a proposal making it mandatory for officials to disclose their assets on the NPC's agenda. This year, however, he has changed tack. He now believes that waiting for asset declaration requirements to be included in a broader law is more realistic as it would give the leadership more time. Any change is likely to take time. Legal experts say China will probably have to amend parts of its criminal code and several other laws in the process. Even those who believe that change is possible think that means it will take a decade before it becomes reality. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","People in China say corruption is worse than ever .

"(CNN) -- You know that a news story has broken through, as we like to say in the journalism business, when Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart start playing it for laughs. In the last few weeks, the dynamic duo of Comedy Central has had a field day with the subject of super PACs, those fundraising machines that can raise unlimited donations to fund political ads, provided that they are not officially affiliated with a specific candidate. When Colbert launched his mock run for ""President of the United States of South Carolina,"" Stewart came on his show to announce that he would head up the ""Definitely Not Coordinated with Stephen Colbert Super PAC,"" swearing that it would have no ties to the friend whose hand he was holding on the set. It's become an easy talking point that this will be the most expensive presidential race in history, and that super PACs could tip the outcome. But in a special In Depth series of reports, CNN will take a hard look at that conventional wisdom -- exploring what super PACs are, what they do, who funds them, and how much power they really have. These special reports will air daily this week across all our prime-time and daytime television shows -- including ""The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer,"" ""John King, USA,"" ""Anderson Cooper 360Ëš,"" ""Piers Morgan Tonight"" and ""Erin Burnett OutFront"" -- and across all our digital platforms. Super PACs vs. the little guy: Why do you donate? We will go behind the scenes at American Crossroads, Karl Rove's conservative PAC that helped launched the trend (and the conspiracy theories). We'll profile Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas billionaire who wrote a $5 million check to a PAC that waged a nasty air war against Mitt Romney in South Carolina, helping to pave the way for Newt Gingrich's stunning primary victory on Saturday. We'll air an investigation into how super PACs have outmaneuvered a bewildering obstacle course of campaign finance regulations, and given rise to calls for a whole new maze of do's and don'ts. At the same time, we'll try to put some much-needed context around a subject that has become grist for knee-jerk partisan rhetoric. We'll report on how Democrats -- Definitely Not Coordinated with President Barack Obama! -- are also playing the super PAC game. (We'll also profile some ""heavy hitters"" who will be openly supporting the president in 2012 and others who have turned their back on him since 2008.) We'll analyze the controversial ""Citizens United"" ruling by the Supreme Court that sanctioned unlimited corporate and union donations to nonaffiliated PACs, showing how it eliminated some troublesome inequities in the previous financing rules while adding new complexities. We will also look at how much money you need nowadays to run for office at the local, congressional and Senate levels, and at how much politicians stand to make personally while in office and once they leave. As CNN's team of political reporters and analysts decamps from South Carolina to cover the Florida primary this week, they will assess the impact that money has -- and hasn't -- had in this electoral cycle so far. How much did it determine who threw their hat into the Republican ring in the first place and who stayed away? How different would things be now if Romney and the (definitely not coordinated) PAC run by his former aides hadn't had millions to savage Gingrich with negatives ads in Iowa, or if Adelson hadn't put up his $5 million to tear down Romney in South Carolina? And could money help alter the dynamic of the GOP primary contest yet again in Florida, given the staggering costs of organizing across such a large state and buying political ads in so many expensive local media markets? For all the hyperventilation about super PACs, we'll also examine all the ways in which the narrative of this campaign shows that money still isn't everything in politics: the flameout of Rick Perry's deep-pocketed campaign, the staying power of Ron Paul's grass-roots movement, the number of times that the ""free media"" of press coverage have shifted the momentum overnight, from the latest debate to the personal scandal du jour. And on CNN.com, we will solicit iReport videos from scores of ordinary citizens across America who have donated $50 or less to a political campaign this year and who want to deliver a simple message: This is what I want for my money! For here at CNN, our aim isn't to take sides or tell you what to think. It's to give you the news and knowledge you need to make up your own mind -- and the confidence to make your own voice heard.","In an In Depth series of reports this week, CNN explores super PACs .

"(CNN) -- At the time when girls should be deciding on where to go to university, most girls in my country are deciding on a wedding dress. I am 16-years-old and where I come from in Bangladesh, many girls my age grow quickly from children to adults because they are forced into marriage. I could have been one of those girls, but I'm one of the few girls in my country who is blessed to have support from my parents and community to live the life of a joyful teenage girl. Every girl should have the right to that life, but there are millions of girls in my country who are not so fortunate and are subjected to child marriage. It makes me sad to think about the fate of these girls, and that is why I am here at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, to share my experience with global leaders and give other girls a chance to change the world with me. According to the UN, any person under the age of 18 is a child. I am still a child, and children like me need love, care and protection. Every child dreams of a brighter future and a better world, but the question is, why does this dream become a nightmare in the lives of so many girls? As a girl, I must ask these questions to the world's leaders. The law in Bangladesh says no girl should get married before 18 years of age and no boy before 21 years of age. But yet, Bangladesh has the highest rate of child marriage among the south Asian countries. It is estimated that two-thirds of Bangladeshi girls are married before the age of 18. In my village, I witnessed lots of wedding parties for underage brides. For the past three years I have lost at least two friends to early marriages at an age where I didn't even know what marriage was. Now those girls have their own children. I don't want to lose any more friends. In my childhood I used to play with dolls. Sometimes I arranged marriages for the dolls. That is how parents treat their daughters â€” like dolls who have no voice. There are many reasons why early marriage is so prevalent in Bangladesh, but one of the biggest reasons is lack of quality education. There are 64,000 villages in our country, and most of the people living in villages have no access to education. They have no idea about the likely consequences of child marriage, and so it's a cycle that continues. Education helps create opportunities for girls to contribute to family income. If a girl can feed her family, it will help parents rethink the idea that their daughters are a burden. Girls who become brides stay uneducated because they must become mothers, caretakers and homemakers, further driving the cycle of poverty and powerlessness. Early marriage has contributed to every problem prevailing in my country, directly or indirectly. It increases child death and maternal death, increases divorce and broken families, increases population and decreases female education and empowerment. If we stop this problem, other problems in our country will be reduced automatically. How can we put a stop to this injustice? Building awareness through films like ""Girl Rising"" that pressure governments to implement laws against child marriage and educating communities like World Vision does in Bangladesh. I am a part of World Vision's child forum and just this year we have used our voices to stop three child marriages in our community. Those girls are still in school. I myself was saved because my own community was made aware of the negative consequences of early marriage and the importance to giving me an education. Both my mother and grandmother were considered burdens in their families. My grandmother got married when she was 9 and my mother got married when she was 16. But at 16 I will not be getting married any time soon, because that cycle has stopped with me. I am not a burden to get rid of. I am a blessing, and I have dreams that I will and can achieve. My hope is that my friends in Bangladesh and girls around the world will get to chase their dreams, too.","Humaiya Akhter is a 16-year-old advocate for girl's education and child rights in Bangladesh .

"(CNN) -- If you've cast Kellie Pickler as either an ""American Idol"" runner-up, pop-country musician or both -- it's time to re-evaluate. Last week she released her third album, ""100 Proof,"" an 11-song set of traditional country music reflecting the potent ballad style of classic stars like Dolly Parton and Tammy Wynette as well as a rowdy side on a few numbers. But it's ""Mother's Day"" that finds Pickler at her best: She's sad and vulnerable throughout. Anyone that knows the story of her strained relationship with her mother can hear the emotion wrapped up in this number. Pickler's voice always worked in her pop-oriented prior albums, but with ""100 Proof"" she sounds wise beyond her 25 years, both in lyric and voice. CNN recently spoke with Pickler about her new album, ditching a pop sound and writing with Taylor Swift. CNN: The new record is called ""100 Proof."" Should we infer this is your most potent batch of songs to date? Pickler: (Laughs.) I guess you could say that. I'm so proud of this record. I've never worked harder on anything like I did this. I branched out, wrote with different song writers; people I never thought in a million years that would write with me. I just really got to take my time and really go back to the roots of country music and show who influenced me growing up. I'm happy that I had the freedom to sprinkle a little bit of that through the record. CNN: Who are these people you were obsessed with when you were growing up? Pickler: I loved Dolly Parton, I love Loretta Lynn and Tammy Wynette. I don't know if it was the fact that their music felt so real and all of their songs came from a real place in their life. I feel like we were all raised the same. CNN: You had a rather rough upbringing. How much of that experience informs your work these days? Songs like ""Tough"" and ""Mother's Day"" stand out. Pickler: I'd definitely say that my life is on this record. When my husband (country musician Kyle Jacobs) and I sat down and wrote ""Mother's Day,"" there were no intentions of it to ever be heard or go into the studio to record it. I don't really think about that when I sit down and write about what I'm going through. I didn't write that song for anybody else but me I guess. Sometimes it's OK to do things for yourself every now and then. A couple of our songwriting friends heard it and they really encouraged me to think about trying to get it on the record. It's one of those things that just kind of happened and there was no plan for it except for me to find closure. CNN: ""100 Proof"" has shifted to this more traditional sound. Sometimes, it's back-bar stomp, other times it's these sleepy, pedal steel ballads. Did you grow tired of the pop-oriented sound? Pickler: I never wanted to be a pop singer. I've never wanted to be. I've always wanted to make records like this. The first thing I ever said when I went into the Sony building was ""I love Tammy Wynette, I love Dolly Parton, I love Loretta Lynn."" Look, times are tough for record companies and I get that they have a formula and have to play certain things safe. Me not being an established artist ... they can't afford to take certain risks. I know who I am now, better. I was 19 when I got in line for ""American Idol."" Nobody knows who they are at 19; you're not supposed to. I did this whole thing backwards. You come off a show like ""Idol"" and you're a celebrity, but for what? You don't have a song on the radio, you don't have an album out. You've been singing cover songs and you haven't done anything really. You have to develop backwards as an artist. Become a celebrity first and figure out ""what kind of artist am I and where do I belong?"" CNN: How does your writing go these days? Pickler: I just write about whatever I feel like that day. I don't ever sit down with a plan. (Songwriter) Leslie Satcher told me -- and I never had anyone say this to me before -- she said ""you speak in lyrics."" And I said ""huh?"" She said ""you speak in lyrics."" The first time we ever wrote, she's writing down everything I'm saying. I don't know how to write about anything else but what's going on. I can't just go in and make some bulls*** up. I can't do that. It has to come from a real place or I can't write it. CNN: A couple of years ago, you penned a tune called ""Best Days of Your Life"" with Taylor Swift. Have you all talked about doing anything more together? Pickler: No we haven't. It's been five years ago ... it feels like. We wrote that when we were out on tour with Brad Paisley and it seems like so long ago. But no, we haven't written since then. But even there, I stormed on our bus and I was upset about a boy and we just ended up writing about it. No intentions of writing, just talking and we started playing. Never thought anyone would hear it. CNN: That seems to be a theme with you. Write something you don't think anyone's going to hear, then release it. Pickler: Yeah. We'll see. Maybe one day I can release and album called ""Work Takes"" and it has all the song's I've written that nobody's heard.","Last week Kellie Pickler released her third album, ""100 Proof,"" a set of country songs .

"New York (CNN) -- By refusing NBC's offer of a ""Tonight Show"" shifted to a post-midnight, post-Jay Leno time slot, host Conan O'Brien has protected the 56-year-old tradition of that program. And he's also protected the 46-year-old Conan O'Brien. Rejecting NBC's recent offer was the best move O'Brien could have made -- even if he was forced into it. Had he stayed where he was, he would most likely would have continued to lose in the ratings. Had he accepted a move to an even later time slot, his losses would likely increase. O'Brien laid down his hand Tuesday afternoon and showed his hole cards, in an aggressively pointed way. He delivered a self-penned missive and handed it to Bill Carter of The New York Times, a long-time respected chronicler of the late-night wars. In it, he talked of protecting the legacy of ""The Tonight Show,"" a concern that his NBC bosses clearly do not share. O'Brien's respect for late-night television and its traditions may be more elusive and less common in the future. Like the evening news, late-night TV still attracts millions of viewers, but its stature is far from what it was. When late-night TV reaches water-cooler-conversation status these days, it's via the Web, not same-night viewing. What do you think about NBC's late-night conundrum? NBC, which announced years ago it would hand the reins of ""The Tonight Show"" from Leno to O'Brien, was hoping for an orderly transition. It wanted to avoid, at all costs, the public and uncomfortable turf war that had David Letterman and Leno vying for Johnny Carson's throne as it was being vacated in 1992. Yet by trying to have its cake and eat it too -- giving Leno a prime-time platform each weeknight in ""The Jay Leno Show,"" which premiered in September -- NBC had months ago set in motion a series of disastrous decisions that makes the Leno-Letterman skirmish seem like a bear hug. Even before Leno's new series premiered, O'Brien had failed, in one measure, as host of ""The Tonight Show."" The long-established ratings lead, which Leno had enjoyed since shortly after Letterman jumped ship to CBS, vanished. And once Leno hit prime time and began hemorrhaging viewers, things only got worse -- for prime time, for the NBC affiliates and their weakened late-news operations and for O'Brien himself. The only good decision NBC has made in this entire process has been to reverse its own decision to put Leno on weeknights in prime time in the first place. There, Leno delivered a program that seemed as cheap as the price tag, and viewers, after sampling a few editions, abandoned it by the millions. But even then, the network most likely would not have pulled him from that spot unless the affiliates had threatened an outright mutiny. (To NBC, the program was much less expensive to produce than a clump of one-hour dramas.) Yet NBC, rather than admit to a bad idea or two, made a third, by promising Leno a return to late-night at 11:35 p.m. in exchange for canceling the prime-time ""Jay Leno Show."" This meant either ""The Tonight Show,"" under O'Brien, would be relegated to a 12:05 a.m. start or O'Brien would quit, opening the way for Leno to regain not just his old time slot, but his old job. O'Brien has pushed it back in NBC's face, saying he won't accept the move to post-midnight. Freed from NBC, O'Brien would be able to reinvent himself, take his time, call his next shot. So unless NBC repeals its offer to Leno, that's it. ""The Tonight Show with Jay Leno"" will rise again. But will the ratings? With Leno a prime-time loser, and a ""Tonight Show"" usurper, that's the latest, biggest question. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of David Bianculli.","David Bianculli says Conan O'Brien protected himself by shunning NBC time shift .

"(CNN) -- The banjo, for years in the background, stepped out of the shadows in the steady hands of Earl Scruggs. Beyond his many recordings and appearances, the bluegrass music legend, who died Wednesday at 88, left an instructional book considered a must-read for novice banjo players. ""Earl Scruggs and the Five-String Banjo,"" first published in 1968, still lays the foundation for beginners, said Eric Schlange, founder of the website Banjo Hangout. By Thursday afternoon, hundreds of the site's 67,000 registered users had left tributes, listed Scruggs songs they played since learning he died and exchanged messages on his groundbreaking technique. The site attracts both grizzled veterans and beginners. ""A lot of those guys played (his) records, slowing down the records so they figured out the notes Earl was playing,"" said Schlange, 32, of Lakeport, California. Playing the banjo well takes dedication. ""It's a very physical instrument. When you are talking about bluegrass style, you have to dial in your technique precisely and practice real consistently,"" said Schlange, a web developer who calls running Banjo Hangout a part-time hobby. For many of a certain age, Scruggs' banjo was part of the soundtrack of an era on ""The Ballad of Jed Clampett"" -- the theme song from the CBS sitcom ""The Beverly Hillbillies,"" which aired on CBS from 1962 to 1971 and for decades afterward in syndication. He played with Bill Monroe's Blue Grass Boys, and later with Lester Flatt with the Foggy Mountain Boys. The 1967 film ""Bonnie and Clyde"" featured their 1949 instrumental ""Foggy Mountain Breakdown."" But much more than that, Scruggs popularized a three-finger picking style that brought the banjo to the fore in a supercharged genre. The late John Hartford, a noted banjo musician in his own right, was quoted in Barry R. Willis' ""America's Music: Bluegrass,"" as summing it up this way: ""Everybody's all worried about who invented the style and it's obvious that three-finger banjo pickers have been around a long time -- maybe since 1840. But my feeling about it is that if it wasn't for Earl Scruggs, you wouldn't be worried about who invented it."" In an article on the Country Music Hall of Fame and Museum's website, bluegrass historian Neil V. Rosenberg described Scruggs' style as ""a 'roll' executed with the thumb and two fingers of his right hand"" that essentially made the banjo ""a lead instrument like a fiddle or a guitar, particularly on faster pieces and instrumentals. This novel sound attracted considerable attention to their Grand Ole Opry performances, road shows, and Columbia recordings."" Traditional bluegrass is ""rapid fire, pretty loud, (with) explosive notes,"" Schlange told CNN. But there is also a quieter side to the banjo. Innovative musician Bela Fleck is known for his jazz style and sparing play. Banjo Hangout's main draw is its many forums on the art of music and banjo-making. Noted players Pete Wernick and Ron Block, who performs with Alison Krauss, are among those who post. ""They (members) all want to be able to play the style of music they are looking for,"" said Schlange. ""Some want to play Earl Scruggs-style bluegrass music. Some want to play old-timey, open-back banjo."" Schlange, who considers himself ""an aspiring banjo player,"" lists Mumford & Sons, Steve Martin, Noam Pikelny and Kristin Scott Benson as influential banjo players on today's scene. Martin, in a January article in The New Yorker, wrote of Scruggs: ""Before him, no one had ever played the banjo like he did. After him, everyone played the banjo like he did, or at least tried."" Scruggs' funeral is set for 2 p.m. Sunday at Nashville's famed Ryman Auditorium. Traffic on Banjo Hangout increased about 50% in the hours after Scruggs' death was announced. ""I was away from the site for five hours and had not heard the news. When I got back there were five topics on the front page about his passing away,"" Schlange said. Typical of forum postings was one by ""rdblansett."" ""As always, whenever Earl stepped up to the mic to do his thing, I marveled at the sheer effortless style of his playing. Just as with any virtuoso of this or any era, he was married to his instrument and no one made it sing as well as he did. It is because of Earl that I picked up the banjo for the first time a couple of months ago, and even though I will never get to meet him, I hope he hears the wail from down here."" CNN's Cameron Tankersley, Denise Quan and Andy Rose contributed to this report.","Banjo players mourn passing of innovative instrumentalist .

"Sao Paulo, Brazil (CNN) -- Oil from a small leak in Brazilian waters -- the second in less than two months -- has reached the shores of Rio de Janeiro state, environmental authorities said. The oil was discovered on Bonfim Beach during a flyover Sunday, according to the state environmental secretariat. The oil is believed to be from a Japanese-operated oil platform that leaked 63 barrels on Friday in the picturesque waters around Ilha Grande and Angra dos Reis, the agency said. In early November, some 3,000 barrels of oil spilled into the ocean at a deep-water well drilled by U.S. oil giant Chevron. In response to the spill, Brazilian federal prosecutors filed a suit last week against Chevron and oil rig operator Transocean Ltd. for about $11 billion. The civil suit also seeks to halt the companiesÂ¹ operations in Brazil. In the case of this second spill, authorities said they would initially levy a $5.4 million fine on Modec, the rig operator. The accidents, though small, are getting high-profile treatment as Brazil begins to develop more deep-water sites in extreme depths off the coast of the state of Rio. Extraction will require extremely complicated techniques but Brazil hopes it will also make the country the third largest oil producer in the world by 2020.","The oil is on a beach in Rio de Janeiro state .

"(Financial Times) -- The government of a remote province in western China says it is investigating Coca-Cola over allegations that it illegally mapped parts of the province, as China and the US engage in an escalating war of words over cyber espionage. The Yunnan Geographical Information Bureau of Surveying and Mapping said the US drinks company had been ""illegally collecting classified information with handheld GPS equipment"", according to a Yunnan government website. Coca-Cola said it had ""co-operated fully"" with the inquiry, adding that local bottling plants use ""e-map and location-based customer logistics systems that are commercially available in China"" to improve customer service and fuel efficiency. ""These customer logistics systems are broadly used for commercial application across many industries in China and worldwide,"" the company said. The Yunnan government said the Coca-Cola case was one of 21 instances of alleged illegal surveying under investigation in the area, which also included others' illegal sales of classified military maps online, aerial photography by unmanned aircraft, and illegal surveying of military bases. The bureau gave no further details of the Coca-Cola investigation, but a bureau official who gave his surname as Han said the investigation would end soon. ""We will announce the results when it ends,"" he told the Financial Times in an interview. ""It is a bit sensitive. I don't know how it got published,"" he added. China National Radio broadcast an interview with Li Mingde, the deputy director of the Yunnan bureau involved in investigating Coke, who said it was ""urgent"" to punish cases of illegal mapping. ""Some people are profiting from collecting information, including providing it to some foreign intelligence agencies,"" he said, noting that when the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was bombed by the US in 1999, the US blamed it on an inaccurate map. ""Mapping information can be used by enemies. So it must be restricted,"" he said. Coke declined to respond to his comments. Beijing and Washington have recently ratcheted up their mutual accusations about cyberspying, with the White House on Monday calling on China to take ""serious steps"" to stop extensive hacking of US companies and start negotiating international rules for behaviour in cyberspace. The comments in the New York Times and other leading newspapers followed reports of Chinese hacking, as well as high-profile research from US cybersecurity company Mandiant which for the first time linked extensive cyberattacks on US businesses to a specific unit of the Chinese military in Shanghai. A recent New York Times report on hacking by the military unit said Coca-Cola had itself been a target. Yang Jiechi, China's foreign minister, has rejected allegations of Chinese military involvement in hacking. ""Anyone who tries to fabricate or piece together a sensational story to serve their political motive will not be able to blacken the name of others or whitewash themselves,"" he said at the weekend.

"(CNN) -- Prince William and Kate Middleton have never been the stay-at-home types. A traveler could plan a royal (and royally expensive) getaway just following in their footsteps. The couple has journeyed to some of the world's most luxurious spots. Here are five places to catch the flavor of a royal vacation. Desroches Island, Seychelles . Kate and William rekindled their romance here with a getaway in 2007. The private, three-mile-long Indian Ocean coral atoll is surrounded by clear turquoise water, and is reached by private plane. The five-bedroom Presidential Villa would seem perfect for the honeymooners, but others can book a beachfront suite for a mere $1,000 per person per night. http://www.desroches-island.com/ . Lewa Safari Camp, Kenya . What better place to soak up royal romance than the spot where Wills finally popped the question? The 65,000-acre conservancy is home to the world's largest population of the endangered Grevy's zebra. But don't think the royal couple was roughing it. Camp ""tents"" have thatched roofs, verandas and bathrooms, and are arrayed around a central lounge with swimming pool. There's also a masseuse to work out those post-safari knots. All-inclusive nightly rates begin at $320. http://www.lewasafaricamp.com/ . Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge, Canada . The royal couple's first official trip will be to Canada, but it won't be all business. It's believed the active pair will end their trip in Alberta's Rocky Mountains, following in the steps of William's grandmother, great aunt and great grandmother, all of whom have stayed at the Fairmont Jasper Park Lodge's six-bedroom Outlook cabin -- the so-called Royal Retreat. (Cost from $2,600 to $6,200 per night.) The rest of us can at least enjoy the resort's view over Lac Beauvert. Mustique, West Indies . William's bride seems to be a beach girl at heart, and this 1,400-acre private island has been her getaway of choice in recent years. Visitors won't be checking into a Holiday Inn, though. Rental villas fill nearly the entire island. For a touch of royalty, kick-back in five-bedroom Les Jolies Eaux, which once belonged to Princess Margaret. Weekly rentals run from $18,000 to $28,000. Duchy of Cornwall, England . Kate and her family spent Christmas 2009 at her future father-in-law's place, the 133,000-acre Duchy of Cornwall. The Middletons stayed in the recently updated, 500-year-old Restormel Manor, which sleeps 18 and has a tennis court and heated swimming pool. Rates run from $1,625 to $5,700 per night, and you will be doing your part to finance the royal wedding: The Duchy helps support the Prince of Wales and his family.","You can visit the same places where British royalty has traveled .

"New York (CNN) -- A 4-year-old boy was killed after being mauled by his family's dog inside their Brooklyn, New York, apartment, according to police spokesman Joseph Gallagher. Jayelin Graham was bitten multiple times in the head, neck and torso by his family's Cane Corso Mastiff, a large muscular breed of canine commonly used as a guard dog or hunting companion. The deadly attack Friday night sent the boy to a nearby hospital where he was pronounced dead upon arrival, according to Brookdale Hospital spokesman Andrew Rubin. Two other small children, a 2- and 5-year-old boy, were in the home at the time but were unharmed. Police say they are continuing to investigate the incident and that New York's Animal Care and Control have removed the dog as well as another dog -- a German shepherd -- from inside the apartment.","A 4-year-old boy was killed after being mauled by his family's dog, police say .

"(CNN) -- At this very moment, 500 miles above your freckle-pocked head, a half-million pieces of junk are orbiting around the Earth. Derelict spacecraft, chunks of machinery deliberately ejected from their vehicles, defunct satellites and even sad specks of paint from spaceships long gone all loop around the vacuity, a sad, eternal ballet of useless crap (according to an alarmingly cracker-barrel website from NASA). But much closer to your fingers lies an equally vacuous void: the Internet, home to millions of pages of unwanted or abandoned debris, swirling slowly in the churn of search results and spider-combing. But figuring out how to handle your own outdated Web content is tricky business. Instead of doing the online equivalent of littering -- sweeping yesteryear into a dustbin of 0s and 1s -- refer to our handy guide for dealing with the past. Your wedding website -- two weeks after the big day . Informative wedding pages are ever-so-useful in the months leading up to the nuptials; they provide travel and lodging information, present the greedy wedding registries in a nonobnoxious way and give us lots of opportunities to laugh in private over those super awkward engagement pics where the woman's standing behind the dude and clutching his pectorals and the guy's wearing an expression of laughing-gas bliss. But such sites lose much of their usefulness after the ceremony. And before long, they take on the gloating tone of a groom who's still using a wedding shot as his Facebook profile pic 11 months after the event. Our two cents: Update the website shortly after you return from your sun-soaked honeymoon with pictures from the event and an earnest, grateful message to all who were there in flesh or spirit. Don't beg guests to contribute their memories to an online guest book -- they bought you a present; their obligation is done. Let the domain registration or hosting die out in the year following your wedding, and get on with it already. The Facebook profile of a loved one who's passed away . Recently, a reader wrote in to ask what she should do with her departed stepdaughter's Facebook page. It's a tough scenario, and it might seem like a silly thing to worry about in the tangle of grieving. But Facebook actually has a memorialization feature, and there's good reason to take advantage of it: It freezes the account so no one else can log in as the user, and it allows only already-confirmed friends to write on the wall in remembrance. That person will no longer show up as a suggested photo tag or in ""people you may know."" In short, it allows the Facebook page to become an homage, an interactive equivalent of a memory book. Check the Facebook help page for more information; family members also can shut down the account permanently, but in many cases the online memorial may be gentler on everybody. Your embarrassing relics of Web 2.0 . If you are of Generation Y, and you tapped away on a hulking desktop in your parents' den through your high school years, you probably have one or more of the following: . -- A Myspace page listing interests such as ""purses!"" and ""vintage stores!"" and featuring an image of you looking haughtily up at a webcam . -- An embarrassing tapestry of snaps in your public Photobucket account . -- An angsty LiveJournal, Xanga or Blogspot account peppered with complaints about your parents/teachers/The Man, as well as various and sundry Dashboard Confessional lyrics. If you're older, the references might change: websites someone made for that overly involved professional football league, a derailed blog purporting to document your child's first year of life, whatever. But the fact remains that these relics, when happened upon by bosses, new swains or those who have a vendetta against you, are just, well, embarrassing. Usually, making such exhibitionist accounts private will do the trick; if you can't remember your log-in information (and your e-mail address has changed, rendering the ""forgot your password?"" option useless), e-mail or call the company to ask it to log you in or take the page down. Because like those hulking chunks of orbital debris, you never know when they'll jet onto a dangerous collision course.","Update a wedding website immediately after the event, then let it die in a year .

"(CNN) -- President Obama's spending plan is just the first step in a process that will involve no less than 40 congressional committees, 24 subcommittees, countless hearings and a number of floor votes in the House and Senate, with the aim of getting funding in place for the federal government by the beginning of the 2012 fiscal year October 1. Congress never passed a budget for the current fiscal year, and the government has been running on a ""continuing resolution,"" which expires March 4. House Republicans have thrown down the gauntlet over cuts to current programs and threaten to shut down the government if they don't get their way. After Obama sends his 2012 plan to Capitol Hill, House and Senate budget committees each pass their own budget resolutions, which set caps on spending and establish revenue targets and generally serve as five- to 10-year blueprints for congressional priorities. The budget resolutions also allocate how much may be spent on broad budget functions like defense and education but not individual programs. House and Senate numbers often differ, and the chambers must resolve their differences and pass a single Budget Act. Obama: Budget 'down payment' on debt . Next, the appropriations committees and subcommittees in each chamber debate how to allocate discretionary funds among government agencies and programs. If all doesn't go according to plan, Congress must pass a continuing resolution like last year's by 11:59 p.m. September 30 to continue funding the government as lawmakers continue to try to slice up the budget pie. Justice budget includes increase for prisons . Here are some highlights from Obama's plan: . Department of Education . There's a good reason Obama went to a school to make his first public pitch after his spending plan was released. Education is one of the few areas to get a significant increase in funding: $4.5 billion more than in his 2011 budget. Obama requests increase for education in 2012 . The $77.4 billion request would be spent on reforms, teacher training for STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and math) and reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, also known as No Child Left Behind. Obama wants to spend $80 million to recruit 10,000 teachers in STEM subjects in the next two years, 100,000 over the next 10 years. He also wants $900 million for a new round of Race to the Top, the competition that rewards states that meet the administrations standards for innovation and outcomes. The budget request maintains the current funding level for Pell Grants, but it recommends dropping the year-round option that began in 2009. It also drops subsidies that allowed grad students to avoid interest accruing on loans while they are in school. Department of Defense . The plan increases the Pentagon's base budget to $553 billion, $22 billion more than last year. Defense, State fight for more funding . It reinvests $100 billion expected to be saved through cuts to areas like development or purchase of unmanned intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance assets; proposals for more ships; a new ground combat vehicle; the Advanced Extremely High Frequency satellite; and the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. The budget includes a 1.6% increase for military pay as well as an increase in housing allowances and health care, especially for wounded service members. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are covered separately, with $118 billion set aside: more than $41 billion less than last year, mostly because of the withdrawal of troops from Iraq. Slight increase sought for Homeland Security . Department of Transportation . The plan provides $13.4 billion in discretionary resources in 2012, a $1.3 billion decrease from 2010. It proposes a six-year, $556 billion surface reauthorization plan to modernize the country's transportation infrastructure. It provides $8 billion in 2012 and $53 billion over six years to reach a goal of providing 80 percent of Americans with convenient access to a passenger rail system, featuring high-speed service, within 25 years. The plan reduces funding for airport grants, focusing support on smaller airports, while giving larger airports more flexibility to raise their own resources. Department of Veterans Affairs . Obama's plan provides $61.85 billion, a 10.6% increase over 2010 . It proposes a multiyear budgeting approach to manage medical care resources across multiple fiscal years, including advance appropriations for the 2013 fiscal year . It reduces construction spending and redirects those funds for care and benefits to veterans. Department of the Interior . Obama's plan budgets $12 billion, which is roughly the same as in previous years, and increases land and water conservation programs. The savings are planned through decreases in the U.S. Geological Survey, cuts in construction programs and tribal program reductions. The plan provides more than $500 million to restructure the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, Regulation and Enforcement and to strengthen oversight of offshore oil and gas operations in the aftermath of the Deepwater Horizon explosion and oil disaster in the Gulf of Mexico last year. Department of State and international programs . The plan provides $47 billion for the State Department and the U.S. Agency for International Development, a decrease of less than 1% from 2010. Increases are made in the areas of food security and global health. Foreign assistance to several countries is cut. The plan reduces funding for the African Development and Inter-American Foundations by nearly 20% and directs them to seek partnerships to leverage remaining funding.","Obama sends plan to Capitol Hill; goal is to get funding in place by start of 2012 fiscal year .

"Ottawa (CNN) -- Britain's Prince William and his wife, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, arrived Thursday in Canada on their first official foreign trip since their wedding in April. The royal couple landed aboard a Royal Canadian Air Force jet during the afternoon in Ottawa, the Canadian capital. ""Merci beaucoup,"" William told a throng of well-wishers. ""Catherine and I are so delighted to be here in Canada. Instilled in us by our parents and grandparents, we love this country. We have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time. And before we were married, we had a longing to come here together. The geography of Canada is unsurpassed and is famous for being matched only by the hospitality of its people."" In French, he added, ""We await with impatience this adventure."" They laid a wreath at the National War Memorial to recognize Canada's servicemen and women, before being formally greeted by Prime Minister Stephen Harper and Governor General David Johnston, in an event that featured full military honors and a 21-gun salute. Catherine spoke with a group of young women while William chatted with a male gymnast, offering the athlete some royal advice: ""Pole vaulting and high jump, you should try that,"" William said. ""You can get more gold medals for Canada as well on that one."" On Thursday evening, they met with young Canadians at a barbecue. Prince William has said it is a ""great privilege"" for him and Catherine to have been invited to Canada for their first trip as a married couple. When the pair left London's Heathrow airport Thursday morning, the duchess -- whose fashion choices are closely watched -- was wearing a jacket by a Canadian label, Smythe les Vestes. The itinerary for the nine-day tour has been designed to mix official events with some less formal activities, including a cooking workshop in Montreal and the Calgary Stampede, an annual rodeo and festival. More than 1,300 accredited journalists will be following their every move. On Friday the couple will mark the Canada Day national holiday by attending a citizenship ceremony and later joining thousands of people for the Parliament Hill Noon Show, featuring music and military displays. Friday would have been the 50th birthday of Prince William's mother, Princess Diana, who was enthusiastically received in 1983 on her own 18-day visit to Canada with Prince Charles. Widespread support for the monarchy makes Canada, which is part of the Commonwealth -- a loose association of nations that used to be part of the British Empire -- a pretty safe bet for a debut royal tour, correspondents say. However, as many as 300 anti-monarchy protesters are expected to demonstrate Sunday at Quebec City Hall, Canadian media reports say. A spokesman for the Quebecois Network of Resistance, a group which wants to cut Canada's ties to the British monarchy, told CTV News: ""As tourists, they're more than welcome in Quebec. But as long as they want to hold a title or pretend to have any authority in Quebec ... they are not welcome."" A poll released on the eve of the visit by Angus Reid Public Opinion suggests one in three Canadians would like to sever all ties with the British monarchy. However, nearly three-quarters of those surveyed have a favorable impression of Prince William, who is second in line to the British throne, while 68% like Catherine. Prince William, who was famously mobbed by screaming girls when he visited Canada as a teenager in 1998, has been keen to return to the country for many years, his private secretary said ahead of the trip. ""Catherine and I are very much looking forward to our tour of Canada. We hope to be able to meet as many people as possible and to see as much of the extraordinary and diverse country as we can,"" the Duke of Cambridge said in a statement on the Canadian government's official website for the tour. ""I have wonderful memories from my last times in Canada, and as such we consider it a great privilege to have been invited to Canada for our first joint tour."" The itinerary also includes stops in Prince Edward Island -- where Prince William will take part in a coast guard rescue exercise -- the Northwest Territories and Alberta. While in the Northwest Territories, the couple will take part in aboriginal activities, including traditional drumming, dancing and sports. The Canadian government, which is paying for the visit, has described it as ""a distinct honor"" and Wednesday unveiled a design for new personal flags, incorporating maple leaves, to be flown to mark the couple's presence. It has also launched an iPhone application to help people follow the tour. Royal enthusiasts can buy a wide range of souvenir merchandise, such as ""I love Kate and William"" T-shirts featuring the Canadian flag. Queen Elizabeth II, William's grandmother, remarked on her trip to Canada last year that, for the royals, the country is a ""home away from home."" After they wrap up their Canadian tour, the prince and duchess will head to California for three days. CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","NEW: ""We have been looking forward to this moment for a very long time,"" Prince William says .

"(CNN) -- The Affordable Care Act emerged as an issue during Thursday night's debate between Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. The claim: ""Look at all the string of broken promises: ' If you like your health care plan, you can keep it,' "" Ryan said, repeating President Barack Obama's oft-stated vow. ""Try telling that to the 20 million people who are projected to lose their health insurance if Obamacare goes through or the 7.4 million seniors who are going to lose it."" The Facts: . Ryan's claim that 20 million Americans will lose their health care under the Affordable Care Act refers to a government analysis in March. The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation analyzed four scenarios and found a range of possibilities -- from Romney's figure of 20 million losing coverage due to Obamacare, to a net increase of 3 million gaining coverage. Fact Check: What about Benghazi? They concluded, ""In CBO and JCT's judgment, a sharp decline in employment-based health insurance as a result of the ACA is unlikely, and, if it occurred, would not dramatically increase the cost of the ACA."" The 7.4 million figure refers to the elderly who would no longer stay in Medicare Advantage -- private plans that were intended to inject competition into Medicare, but wound up costing more. As a result, the Obama administration has moved to cut them. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services projected in a 2010 paper (""Estimated Financial Effects of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act"") that enrollment in the plans in 2017, when the Medicare Advantage cuts are to be fully phased in, will be about half (7.4 million) of what it would have been absent Obamacare. ""To say these folks would lose insurance is just not true,"" according to Prof. Uwe Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University. ""Any elderly person losing Medicare Advantage, if any, would automatically be covered by traditional Medicare,"" he said in a telephone interview. Fact Check: Iran and the bomb . And any people losing employment-based insurance would have individually purchased insurance, bought through an exchange, probably with partial support through federal subsidies, he said. Conclusion: It is unlikely that 20 million Americans will lose their health insurance under the Affordable Care Act and it is not true that 7.4 million seniors will lose their coverage.

"(CNN) -- Rick Santorum marches forward to the next GOP primary battle with wins in Alabama and Mississippi, throwing cold water on rival Mitt Romney's prediction that his campaign was reaching a ""desperate end."" Romney, rejected again by Southern conservatives in the Tuesday primaries, was battling for second place with Newt Gingrich. The latter had staked his campaign on a Southern strategy after winning South Carolina and Georgia. In Alabama, Santorum won 35% of the vote. Gingrich and Romney both had 29% -- although Gingrich was about 2,000 votes ahead with 99% of the vote counted -- and Ron Paul had 5%. With 99% of the vote counted in Mississippi, Santorum had 33%. Gingrich was at 31%, Romney at 30% and Paul at 4%. In another of Tuesday's races, Romney claimed victory in the caucuses of American Samoa, picking up the U.S. territory's nine delegates, according to local party officials. CNN also projects he will win the Hawaiian caucuses. American territories play a significant part in the GOP presidential race in March. Last Saturday, Romney won caucuses in Guam and the Northern Mariana Islands. He also picked up a majority of the delegates in the U.S. Virgin Islands. The next contest on the GOP primary calendar is Puerto Rico on Sunday. ""We did it again,"" Santorum told supporters Tuesday night in Lafayette, Louisiana, which will hold a GOP primary on March 24. Santorum, whose Alabama and Mississippi victories give him 10 wins to Romney's 18, poked at the frontrunner as he reiterated his stance that he is the viable conservative alternative to the former Massachusetts governor. ""People (said), 'You're being outspent (by Romney),' and everybody's talking about all the (delegate) math, and that his race is inevitable. Well, for someone who thinks this race is inevitable, (Romney) has spent a whole lot of money against me for being inevitable,"" Santorum told supporters. Earlier in the day, Romney, who still holds a large overall delegate lead, said Santorum's campaign was trying to resuscitate a losing effort. ""Sen. Santorum is at the desperate end of his campaign and trying in some way to boost his prospects,"" Romney said on CNN's ""The Situation Room."" As news was breaking of Santorum's win in Alabama, Santorum communications director Hogan Gridley replied to Romney's statement, saying, ""It's just the beginning."" Santorum, a former senator from Pennsylvania, was coming off a big win in Kansas on Saturday and has given himself a bigger boost in the battle to be the conservative alternative to Romney by beating Gingrich in Alabama and Mississippi, in Gingrich's home turf in the South. The wins are somewhat of a surprise, because polls released Monday showed Santorum running 8 to 10 points behind Romney and Gingrich in the two states. Still, because Alabama's 47 delegates and Mississippi's 37 delegates will be awarded proportionally, Romney appeared to maintain his delegate lead and may add to it after more moderate Hawaii's 17 delegates are distributed. A CNN delegate estimate early Wednesday showed Romney with a 489-234 lead over Santorum, giving him a 255-delegate margin. The estimate had Gingrich at 139 delegates and Paul at 66. The number of delegates needed to clinch the nomination is 1,144. Gingrich, speaking to supporters in Birmingham, Alabama, focused on the amount of votes that Romney didn't get, and said that ""the elite media's effort to convince the nation that Mitt Romney is inevitable just collapsed."" ""The fact is that in both states, the conservative candidates got nearly 70% of the vote, and if you're the frontrunner and you keep coming in third, you're not much of a frontrunner,"" Gingrich said. ""And frankly, I do not believe that a Massachusetts moderate who created Romneycare as the forerunner of Obamneycare is going to be in a position to win any debates this fall, and that is part of the reason I've insisted in staying in this race."" Gingrich, who was under the most pressure to take both states, said he still had time to persuasively argue that he is the conservative who should go against President Barack Obama in the fall. The former House speaker has won contests in South Carolina and Georgia, which he represented in Congress for two decades, but has finished third or worse in most contests outside the region and campaigned intensively in Alabama and Mississippi over the last week. Romney's campaign has been holding up its large lead in delegates as a reason for Gingrich and Santorum to get out of the race. But Romney, who flew to New York on Tuesday ahead of a fundraiser and did not plan to address supporters Tuesday night, wouldn't have turned down a win in a region dominated by social conservatives, who have been hesitant to support his candidacy. Eric Fehrnstrom, a Romney campaign senior adviser, said the campaign met its goal of taking roughly one-third of the Mississippi and Alabama delegates. ""Once the dust clears, you'll be able to look and see that there really will be no ground that our opponents have made up against Mitt Romney,"" Fehrnstrom said Tuesday night. ""And as you look at the upcoming contests on the calendar, there are no opportunities for them to have significant wins that allow them to accumulate large numbers of delegates so that they can close that gap with Mitt Romney."" Election night blog . Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary under President George W. Bush, said, ""There is no end in sight."" ""I think the real impact ... tonight is that for Republicans who thought that maybe Mitt Romney could come South and make this race look like it was coming to an end, this race is going on and on and on,"" Fleischer, a CNN contributor, said. Delegate tracker | Delegate calculator . Alabama exit polls . Exit polls from Alabama and Mississippi show that Romney still has some ground to make up to win over conservatives: In Alabama, 55% of those polled said Romney's position on the issues wasn't conservative enough; in Mississippi, the number was 49%. In another trend that has continued throughout the campaign, more voters saw Romney as the best choice for defeating Obama in the general election. In Alabama, 46% saw Romney as being the most likely to beat Obama, while both Santorum and Gingrich were the favorites of 24%; in Mississippi, 50% of those polled saw Romney as having the best chance of beating Obama, compared to 24% for Gingrich and 23% for Santorum. As results were coming in Tuesday night, CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger said that hardcore conservatives' persistent preference for Santorum or Gingrich means Romney benefits from the presence of both. ""Gov. Romney needs Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich right now. ... If it weren't for them splitting the conservatives -- the very conservative, the evangelical, the tea party voters -- Mitt Romney would not be within sort of a position to win in either of Mississippi or Alabama. So the fact that they're splitting the vote ... he ought to pay them both to stay in for a little bit longer."" Mississippi exit polls . Results of all races . Santorum and Romney are expected to split the next few contests on the calendar. Santorum won the nonbinding primary in Missouri in February and is expected to take the state's caucuses on Saturday. Romney is expected to win Puerto Rico's primary on Sunday but Santorum will now travel there to try to make it harder for Romney. Polls in Illinois, which votes on Tuesday, show a tight race and Santorum is expected to win in Louisiana a week from Saturday. Then the race turns north and eastward â€” the District of Columbia, Maryland and Wisconsin vote on April 3 and Romney is the early favorite there. But that's three weeks away and much has changed in such a span in the most volatile Republican race in generations. Alabama results | County by county | Map . Mississippi results | County by county | Map . Paul, a congressman from Texas, didn't campaign over the past week in either Alabama or Mississippi.

"(CNN) -- President Barack Obama trumpeted his manufacturing and export agenda Friday, telling a crowd in Washington state that the American economy is poised for a strong, long-term recovery with the right kind of government assistance. ""The last few decades haven't been easy for manufacturing,"" the president said during a tour of Boeing's assembly plant in Everett. But ""in this country we don't give up even when times are tough."" Americans ""don't have to sit there and settle for a lesser future,"" he asserted. Obama's remarks were made on the third day of a West Coast swing mixed with policy announcements and political events. Among other things, he discussed the need to provide greater export financing to American manufacturing companies while expanding support for small business. He hit on the need to ensure fairer trading practices with China -- a political hot button in the current campaign. Several of Obama's Republican critics have attacked the administration for failing to do more to reduce America's trade imbalance with the growing Asian power. ""I will go anywhere in the world to open up new markets for American products,"" Obama said. ""If we have a level playing field, America will always win because we have the best workers."" The speech -- built on the administration's ""Blueprint for an America to Last"" -- came three days after a litany of administration officials, including the president and Vice President Joe Biden, met with Chinese Vice President Xi Jinping in Washington. During the speech, the president highlighted his promise to double American exports over five years -- a goal he said is on track to be reached ahead of schedule. Obama pushed Congress in his speech to reauthorize the U.S. Export-Import Bank, the official credit agency tasked with helping to finance the foreign purchase of goods from American companies who are unable to accept the credit risk themselves. In 2011, the bank provided $41 billion in financing to over 3,600 U.S. companies. According to a White House news release, these ""programs come at no cost to U.S. taxpayers, as the (bank) not only operates on a self-sustaining basis, but it has returned well over $3 billion to the U.S. Treasury since 2005."" Obama also said he wants to help American firms get matching support to counter financing that other multinational companies are receiving from their governments. He encouraged Congress to reform the tax code to discourage overseas manufacturing while providing additional support to manufacturers that make cutting edge products or set up shop in economically depressed areas. Obama was scheduled to visit two campaign fundraisers following his visit to Boeing.","NEW: Obama pushes manufacturing, export agenda during visit to Boeing .

"(CNN) -- The United States has a new charge d'affairs in Libya to oversee diplomatic efforts in the wake of Ambassador Chris Stevens' killing. Laurence Pope arrived Thursday in Tripoli to take on the role, the State Department announced. With no ambassador in the country, Pope will handle those duties. State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland said Pope ""looks forward to working with the Libyan government and the Libyan people during this historic and challenging time, as we build strong economic, social, political, and educational bridges between our two people."" ""We will continue to assist as Libya builds democratic institutions and broad respect for the rule of law -- the goals that Ambassador Stevens worked hard to achieve,"" Nuland said in a written statement. Pope, who was born in 1945, is coming out of retirement to take the job. A speaker of Arabic and French, he spent decades in the diplomatic ranks, beginning in 1969, before retiring in 2000. He held some senior posts, including director of Northern Gulf Affairs, associate director for counterterrorism, and political adviser to the commander of U.S. Central Command.","Laurence Pope is the new charge d'affairs in Libya, handling ambassador duties .

"(EW) -- Sheldon Cooper, Leonard Hofstadter and Raj Koothrappali may not be doctors of the medical sort, but they still know how to serve up a heaping dose of the best medicine (a.k.a. laughs — lots of them) to a sold-out audience. At least, that's what their real-life counterparts — along with other cast members and writer/producers of ""The Big Bang Theory"" — did Wednesday evening for the CBS comedy's PaleyFest panel in Beverly Hills' Saban Theatre. PaleyFest 2013: 'New Girl' cast on alter-egos and the future of Nick and Jess . The event, presented by the Paley Center for Media, was pretty short on spoilers. The production schedule is currently not that far ahead of viewers, who will get to see the 19th episode of season six tonight, but there were plenty of entertaining and funny behind-the-scenes stories and playful moments among the talent on the panel, which was moderated by ""NCIS"" actress Pauley Perrette. Read on for 10 highlights from the ""Big Bang Theory"" panel: . 1. The scene when Penny first tells Leonard ""I love you"" was shot in only one take . Kaley Cuoco (Penny), whose face brightened with a big grin when asked about this scene, revealed that she and Johnny Galecki (Leonard) pulled it off in just one ""very special take."" Executive producer Steven Molaro recalled telling the two actors, ""'That was beautiful. It's never gonna be better than that,' and then Kaley said to Johnny, 'I don't know about you, but we started the scene, and it was like the audience went away and the cameras went away and it was just us.'"" That got a big ""awww"" out of the PaleyFest crowd. 2. Everybody loves Lucy . The cast and writers seem to be having a fun time with Kate Micucci aboard the show playing Raj's (sort of) girlfriend, Lucy. ""It's really fun playing opposite an actress that is talented and really listens and reacts,"" Kunal Nayyar (Raj) told EW in the press tent before the panel. Inside the Saban Theatre, he told the crowd that he has enjoyed this storyline ""because you play a character for six years, and in my case, you grow affection for that character. You really want to see that character succeed. It's really lovely to see him explore that side, which I think has been missed for so long while he's been seeing the growth of his friends."" Co-creator Chuck Lorre told EW that Raj and Lucy's recent texting date won't be the last time we see them come up with a creative way to communicate, but Raj will also ""continue to rely on demon rum to help him overcome his shyness."" He's not going to let that pesky selective mutism get in his way! Jim Parsons to executive produce TV series about real-life geniuses . 3. That spanking scene . Sheldon went old-school with his punishment for Amy when she lied about being sick. Though ""punishment"" isn't exactly how the delighted Amy thought of the near-BDSM experience. Jim Parsons (Sheldon) revealed that while the spanking was always in the script for that December 2012 episode, it was originally planned to be off-camera. The original gag had Amy's spanking, along with two other points of the episode, paired with the image of Amy's monkey mimicking the image of ""see no evil,"" ""hear no evil"" and then ""speak no evil."" Ultimately, once the writers decided to put the spanking on-camera, Parsons found the scene ""one of the hardest things I've had to do — because it was so amusing."" After Cuoco and Galecki recalled the shot needing several takes, Mayim Bialik (Amy) confessed, ""There was some redness!"" 4. How did last fall's flash mob come together? When the cast and crew surprised their studio audience — and their producers — with a flash mob dance last October, it was the result of two weeks of rehearsals. The idea was Cuoco's, who recruited her sister to do the choreography. As for that back-spin of Galecki's, the actor had originally expressed no interest in participating, but ""I saw their last rehearsal, and after rolling my eyes for two weeks, I said, 'I really want to be a part of this,'"" Galecki recalled. He didn't have time to learn the whole dance, but he contributed his move that he ""usually save[s] for weddings."" 5. We may see Sheldon's Meemaw in a future episode . When an audience member questioned the producers about Sheldon's oft-talked-about but yet-to-be-seen grandmother, Molaro said, ""We've talked about [having her appear on the show]. I certainly don't rule it out. I don't know how she'd feel about Amy."" When that last comment was met with nervous laughter and hmms from the audience, Molaro quickly followed up: ""She loves Amy! She will love Amy!"" 'Arrow,' 'Big Bang Theory,' 'Supernatural,' 'NCIS: LA': Find out what's next in the Spoiler Room . 6. How does one call up George Takei to ask him to do that scene? When the writers created the scene in which Howard has a dream about ""Battlestar Galactica"" hottie Katee Sackhoff that is soon interrupted by George Takei, the task of calling up the celebrated ""Star Trek"" actor about the guest spot fell to co-creator Bill Prady. ""We wrote a line of Howard saying, 'I'm so confused' and thought it'd be really funny if George Takei said, 'Confused? Perhaps I can help.'"" Prady said. ""How do I say to this guy that he's a possible homosexual fantasy? ... Finally I said, 'Alright, so you know you're gay, right?' and he said,"" — cue George Takei accent — ""'That's news. I'll tell my husband.'"" 7. Tonight's episode is a touching and emotional one . Tonight's episode, titled ""The Closet Reconfiguration,"" centers around a discovery Sheldon makes when reorganizing Bernadette and Howard's closet: . He unwittingly opens a letter from Howard's father (who abandoned Howard and Mrs. Wolowitz when he was a kid) that our favorite diminutive engineer has never braved reading since he received it at age 18. It's an emotion-filled episode, the cast said, that features each character supporting Howard through the tough situation in their own way. ""You get to see how good [Howard's] friends really are and how kind of fallible they are and yet unflappable. They don't change. But everybody is coming from a sweet, good place,"" Simon Helberg (Howard) told EW. ""They're all put in a position to figure out how to best support their friend,"" Galecki told EW. ""It's a sensitive issue, and I think the conclusion that they come to is really smart and unique and has never been done on television before. It's one of my favorite episodes, I swear to God. I'm not just saying that ... It really is."" 'The Big Bang Theory': Dr. Sheldon Cooper inspires new bee name . 8. How will the season six finale compare to last season's big closer? ""That was pretty big,"" Lorre said to EW of the season five finale. ""A wedding and a Russian rocket into space is pretty big. I think we can safely say this [year's finale] will be smaller, more intimate."" 9. The tale of Melissa Rauch's ""Smurfette"" The biggest applause of the night was saved for the hilarious Melissa Rauch (Bernadette). The audience raved when she impersonated Howard's mother's voice, and when she told a story about getting her makeup removed following the day of shooting this season's Halloween episode. Getting off all that blue Smurf makeup required some hot towels and the work of Rauch's regular makeup artist and two assistants, both of whom were men. ""It was getting late, and I'm starting to fall asleep,"" Rauch recalled, ""and I lifted my legs up to get the rest of the makeup off and heard the guy laugh and thought, 'Oh, they're just telling jokes.' But then I looked in the mirror and thought, 'What's that?! Dear Lord Jesus, that's my business!' I had totally exposed myself! I put my legs down and just said to them, 'Long night!' That is the tale of my Smurfette!"" 10. Where did 'bazinga' come from? Sheldon's catchphrase now beloved by fans and nerdy T-shirt companies everywhere got its start as now-showrunner Steven Molaro's catchphrase. Prady told the audience that during the show's second season, Molaro would use the word to mean ""gotcha"" when he pulled a trick on a fellow writer. A ""bazinga"" was in order, for example, when Molaro gave Prady a grapefruit that turned out to be hollowed out then carefully taped back together. And that's how the catchphrase of smug, trickster Sheldon was born. See the original story at EW.com.

"LONDON, England (CNN) -- This month, CNN Business Traveller takes an in-depth look at how the aviation industry is faring as global fuel prices continue to rise.

"(CNN) -- Both houses of the New Jersey legislature plan to vote Monday on a controversial bill backed by Democrats that would qualify illegal immigrants for in-state tuition at public colleges and universities. Supporters hope to pass the measure before Democratic Gov. Jon Corzine leaves office. Gov.-elect Christopher J. Christie, a Republican who takes office January 19, has said he opposes the bill. On Thursday, a Senate vote on the legislation was postponed. After hours of heated debate January 4, the bill passed the Assembly Appropriations Committee, 7-4, and the Senate Budget and Appropriations Committee, 8-6. Both votes were along party lines. To qualify under the bill, New Jersey high school graduates who are illegal immigrants must be enrolled at a public university or college and file an affidavit with the institution stating that they have applied for legal immigration status or will do so when eligible. If signed into law, the bill would be the 11th of its kind. There are similar laws in California, Illinois, Kansas, Nebraska, New Mexico, New York, Oklahoma, Texas, Utah and Washington. In 2008, Oklahoma ended its support for in-state tuition for students who are in the United States illegally. New Jersey Assemblyman Samuel Thompson, a Republican, said the bill discriminates against U.S. citizens who attend New Jersey colleges and universities but don't live in the state. Thompson believes illegal immigrants do not have the right to a reduced tuition. ""You can call it undocumented, you can call it whatever you want. But you are not legal and you are not entitled,"" Thompson said. Assemblywoman Valerie Huttle, a Democrat, expressed frustration with misconceptions of the bill that label it as a ""free ride"" or ""state-funded"" education. ""These students have been here for decades, have gone through the school system here and should pay the same as their counterparts who have gone through school with them,"" she said. G. Jeremiah Ryan, president of Bergen Community College in Huttle's district, supports the bill. ""The undocumented kids have a tough time anyway. They're really good about going to class,"" Ryan said. ""Then they stop because they can't afford to go to a four-year institution."" The New Jersey Office of Legislative Services said the bill would not affect state revenue because the state does not collect revenue from public colleges and universities. It is estimated that the bill's provisions would increase the number of illegal immigrants applying for admission. Assemblyman Michael Carroll, a Republican, questioned the validity of a bill that improves illegal immigrants' access to education when their illegal status prohibits them from giving back to the state in a meaningful way. However, proponents of the bill believe that the young students will be resources for the state. Democrats say that the backlog in applications for citizenship is the real culprit and that the controversy highlights the need for immigration reform on a national level. Daniel Hurley, director of state relations and policy analysis at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, agreed. ""New Jersey could be the tipping point in terms of energizing Congress to put immigration reform higher on the agenda,"" he said. Hurley cited a lack of legislative activity regarding in-state tuition for illegal immigrants in the past few years and applauded the New Jersey legislature. The legislation is the path to a more rational policy on education and immigration on a federal level, he said. ""These men and women are not going back to their native homeland by and large; they will be staying in New Jersey and the U.S. The question is: Do we want to facilitate their education and professional aspirations so they can contribute civically and economically, or do we want to prevent that?"" Hurley said. ""They may very well become a liability."" Thompson had blunt words for immigrants whose illegal status he felt nullified their right to education, ""Go back home, apply, come legally, and I'll welcome you with open arms."" However, students who have lived illegally with their families in the United States see the opportunities the bill would give them. One such student -- Aura, who would only give her first name -- has been praised by teachers for her high grades. ""This bill would just make our school dream possible. They're not giving it to us for free,"" said Aura, who is now a U.S. citizen. ""If they open up this channel for us, we'll do the rest.""","Democratic backer: Students ""should pay the same as their counterparts""

"(EW.com) -- Cheerios, rejoice! Jane Lynch, who won an Emmy as sharp-tongued cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester on Fox's ""Glee,"" will make her Broadway debut this spring in the hit musical revival of ""Annie."" The role seems like a perfect fit for the star: Miss Hannigan, the drunken and scheming head of young Annie's orphanage who melodically complains about being surrounded by ""little girls."" Lynch, an Illinois native who got her start in theater at Chicago's Steppenwolf Theatre Company and Second City, will appear in the musical for eight weeks only, from May 16 through July 14. Two-time Tony-winner Katie Finneran, who has played Miss Hannigan since the new revival opened last November, was recently cast as Michael J. Fox's sister in an untitled new NBC sitcom that has a 22-episode commitment for this fall. She's expected to leave ""Annie"" sometime this spring to begin production on the single-camera series. Producers have yet to announce her final performance date, a decision that could impact her Tony chances in the Supporting Actress in a Musical category. Dorothy Loudon won a Tony playing Miss Hannigan (then considered a lead role) in the original 1977 production. Michael Moore helps detained filmmaker . ""Some may say I know a thing or two about playing intimidating authority figures,"" Lynch said in a statement. ""So I am excited and honored to be making my Broadway debut ... and joining the pantheon of women who have taken on the great and irresistible role of wicked Miss Hannigan."" Even without a Hollywood star, the ""Annie"" revival has been a consistent box office performer, often topping $1 million in weekly grosses. For the week ending February 17, it took in $954,565, roughly 68 percent of its potential earnings for the Palace Theatre. See the original article at EW.com.

"CNN's Larry King knew George Carlin for 50 years.  He spoke to CNN.com about his relationship with the comedian and will remember Carlin on tonight's Larry King Live, 9 ET. Larry King interviews George Carlin on June 7, 2001.  King knew Carlin for 50 years. CNN: When did you first meet George Carlin? Larry King: In 1958, I introduced him at a big DJ convention in Miami. He was a straight comic then, all his bits dealt with radio, things like the hippy-dippy weatherman. From there, we became friendly, and we occasionally went to dinner in New York. CNN: When did you last see him? Larry King: A couple of months ago, I saw him at the Regency Hotel in New York. I was checking in, he was checking out. We talked a little bit. He had remarried -- his first wife had died -- and he was very happy. My heart doctor in Los Angeles had treated George in the past, and had told me that he had terrible heart problems. CNN: Where does he rank as a comedian? Larry King: He was one of the brightest comedians in my lifetime. Whether you agreed or disagreed with him, it was always well thought out. He wrote out all his material by hand, and then memorized it. Everything he said was totally his own, and he'd do a new act every year, which is very hard to do.  Watch George Carlin on Larry King Live » . CNN: What was he like off stage? Larry King: He was a kind, gentle man. He seemed rough on stage, but he really was not like that at all. Also, his greatest comic influence was Lenny Bruce. Carlin used to do mother-in-law jokes, disc-jockey jokes. But Bruce influenced him to do edgier, more topical material. He also influenced how Carlin moved around on stage. CNN: What was the impact of the ""seven dirty words?"" Larry King: It's one of the classic comedy bits of all time. It was great conception and a great idea. It pointed up the hypocrisy of society. People take words too seriously. Violence is a lot worse than words. All those words, while not used on air, are used in society. George once said, if a word shocks you, you must have heard it somewhere else. CNN: Where does he rank as a comedian? Larry King: He ranks very high as a social monologist, and he commented on social things. He was also a pretty good actor. CNN: How did other comedians view him? Larry King: I never heard a bad word about him in the comedy world. Some religious people didn't like him. He will really be missed. If you want to use the word ""one of a kind,"" he was one of a kind.","Larry King first met George Carlin at a DJ convention in 1958 .

"(CNN) -- When Superstorm Sandy hit the eastern United States and the country's largest city, millions of residents across our five boroughs felt its impact and devastation. Many of us felt vulnerable, unsure what the next days would bring. Communities are still reeling from the aftermath and the most difficult period may still be ahead. But as our city begins to rebuild and recover, New Yorkers and others in the region who already struggle on a regular basis will have the hardest time getting back on their feet. Thankfully, we've seen a huge outpouring of support and number of people willing to donate their time and resources to help. And for those willing to pitch in, please join us. Our government is certainly doing its best to help those in need in the aftermath of the storm, but the nonprofit sector plays such a critical role in the delivery of health and human services across New York City and throughout the country. Numerous low-income families depend on vital community-based nonprofits to access the services they need for daily living. That is one reason why United Way created the United Way Hurricane Sandy Recovery Fund (#sandyfund). Local United Ways along the Eastern Seaboard will use contributions to the fund to address the near- and long-term recovery needs of communities most affected by the hurricane. In addition, the fund will bolster United Way community impact partners that serve hurricane-affected individuals and families who are already vulnerable -- struggling with food insecurity and the ability meet their most basic needs. Disasters like this unprecedented storm undoubtedly impact all of our communities. Our most under-resourced communities, however, have been trying to make ends meet even before Sandy barreled in. For the third straight year, New York City's poverty rate has been on the rise according to census bureau data, with one in five New Yorkers lacking enough income and earnings to pay for basic necessities. In fact, United Way of New York City's most recent hunger survey found that two-thirds of New Yorkers were concerned that someone they know will need help getting and paying for food in the next 12 months. Map: See images of destruction, recovery across the East Coast . These financial pressures are exacerbated when an unexpected hardship like a natural disaster strikes. Some families' primary earners continue to lose hourly wages because they can't get to work. In other cases, those jobs no longer exist as flooded offices and businesses have been forced to close. The loss of even a week's income can be devastating, never mind being suddenly thrust into unemployment. Plus, tens of thousands of New Yorkers will be displaced for weeks to come. Some may be unable to return to their homes at all. It is not the first time United Way has stepped in to help those most in need. For example, following the 9/11 attacks, United Way of New York City created the September 11th Fund in partnership with The New York Community Trust, raising and distributing more than $500 million. Following the devastating earthquake in Haiti in 2010, United Way of NYC partnered with the Brooklyn Community Foundation to found and fund the NYC Haitian Hope & Healing Fund to address the short- and long-term needs of affected individuals residing in New York. And following last year's Hurricane Irene, United Way of New York State set up the Hurricane Irene Recovery Fund to help those in need. Our needs today remain just as great. Early estimates put Sandy's damage at $30 billion to $50 billion in losses. Let's not forget about our already struggling low-income families who will feel these losses deeply.","United Way's Hurricane Sandy Recovery Fund helps low-income families .

"(CNNMexico.com) -- Carlos and Adriana have been dating for six years, and though they don't see each other regularly, they value their relationship. A decade ago, when they didn't even know each other, Carlos and Adriana were diagnosed with schizophrenia; from that moment their love lives became a more complex issue than most people have to deal with. Adriana describes herself as an introverted woman. She is 42 years old and was diagnosed with schizophrenia at the age of 33. ""I didn't take care of myself. I didn't want to shower and I was not wearing clothes for my age,"" she remembers. ""I was very depressed. My dad was concerned and decided to take me to a doctor."" Carlos, 46, says he passed out while he was working back in 2000. He didn't realize that from that moment he was going to start experiencing symptoms of schizophrenia, a mental disorder suffered by approximately 1.5 million Mexicans. ""I began to have delusion of persecution. I was very stressed,"" he says. ""This led me to be a person that was very hard to deal with. I used to think that people knew what I was going to say, that people could read my mind. I was living in a permanent state of stress, I was paranoiac and it was horrible."" The couple met in a therapy group. Adriana says she is happy now that she has someone to talk with. ""I don't have a lot of people to talk with about my personal issues because they don't believe me or they don't want to help me with my deliriums,"" she says. Carlos was married when he was diagnosed. He says his wife didn't know ""how to understand"" that he was suffering from a mental disorder and that is why she decided to leave him. She doesn't allow Carlos to stay in touch with his kids. ""My oldest daughter is now 19. The other two were really young the last time I saw them,"" he says. ""They don't recognize me. A year ago my ex-wife allowed me to meet with my daughter -- she told me she was going to college to be a psychologist. I kissed her and hugged her, but she told me she needed time to understand this situation. Since then, she hasn't answered my letters or phone calls."" María Luisa Rascón, a psychologist and researcher at the National Institute of Psychiatry Ramón de la Fuente in Mexico explains that schizophrenia is a degenerative chronic disease that alters human senses; this leads the patient to suffer delusion of persecution, to hear voices or even think that water tastes like acid. It prevents the patient from having a clear perception of what is real and what is not, she says. For Carlos, the main reason to get better is to recover his children. However, he knows that to achieve this, he will need to become financially stable again, in order to help support his children. ""I lost everything because of the schizophrenia,"" he says. Rascón says that in some cases family members are not aware of what a patient is going through after the diagnosis of a mental disorder, and that leads them to leave them. ""The family stigmatizes their sick relative because they are also suffering a social stigma; they feel pushed back and do the same to their loved one. Having a relationship while you are handling with that negative interaction of the rejection, it could be very difficult."" According to the National Institute of Psychiatry of Mexico, 28% of the Mexican population has suffered from some type of mental disorder, such as emotional disorders or anxiety. The National Survey on Discrimination in Mexico made by the National Council to Prevent Discrimination in 2010 showed that 20% of people with disabilities are discriminated against. For another patient, Rocío, who was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1996, discrimination was a complex difficulty during her rehabilitation. She and her husband worked in the same company, but when Rocío started to show symptoms such as deliriums and hallucinations, the husband's co-workers started to joke about it, making him feel bad. He felt pressure to quit his job. After the couple left their jobs, their relationship ended because of their financial struggles. In 1994 she moved with her 4-year-old son to her mother's house. ""In 1990, I started to hear voices everywhere. I tried to run away, I closed doors and windows in my house to avoid hearing them, but it was useless. I heard laughs and people gossiping about me while walking in the street. I heard them even on the TV and on the radio,"" Rocío remembers. The stress due to a lack of job security exaggerated her disease, she adds. Five years after she separated from her husband, her son confessed that his father was already living with another family. Rocío did not feel angry. ""I felt good for him, he found happiness, something he didn't have with me."" During a job interview -- a couple of years after she started her treatment -- she met her current partner. ""We see each other a few times, not very often because he has a family,"" she says. ""We keep our relation secret; my son doesn't know about it and thinks he is only a friend of mine."" As part of her rehabilitation therapy, Rocío attends a radio show called Open Radio every week. It is hosted by people who previously had a mental disease and is produced by the psychologist Sara Makowski. It airs from The Metropolitan Autonomous University in Mexico City. Makowski describes the radio show as a space for dialogue, which offers a safe environment in which people suffering from a mental disorder can express themselves. In three years, Makowski says, relationships with a partner have been a recurrent topic of discussion among the participants. ""The issues with love ... (are) deeply human. To listen to what they think about love is a great way to get closer to them and to understand that we are not living in distant worlds, that there are bridges that can help us go from one world to another."" ""We are lonely people,"" Rocío affirms. She is ready to find a man who hasn't suffered from any mental disorder and is willing to commit. This is not the case for another patient, Enrique, 42; he admits to being comfortable without a girlfriend. Since he was diagnosed with schizophrenia, eight years ago, he has become more social because of the workshops he has gone to as part of his rehabilitation process. ""Because of the disease, I became unfriendly and shy,"" he says. ""In my life I have made few friends, the majority in my childhood. When I was sick I felt like a monster. I didn't understand what my physical constitution was."" Enrique hasn't been able to understand what happened to the 15 years of his life before he was diagnosed with a mental disorder at the age of 34. Schizophrenia made him think he could communicate telepathically with his ancestors and he was feeling that everything was an aggression against him. He says he already has overcome that phase. Now Enrique compares himself with the movie ""El Bulto"" (""Excess Baggage""), in which a man wakes up after 20 years in coma, without understanding that his country, his family and his world have changed. ""I've never been in a romantic relationship. It is difficult to be in a relationship with someone with a mental disease; you have a lot of issues,"" Enrique says. ""I can't be with a person like me. I would like to be with someone that didn't have a mental disorder."" Read this story in Spanish at CNNMéxico.com .","Schizophrenia is a degenerative chronic disease that alters human senses .

"(CNN) -- Choosing to step down from a top job can be an extraordinary decision, whether the person is a pontiff or a politician. But George Pataki, former governor of New York, says making the switch from public figure to John Q. Public wasn't difficult for him. ""I made up my mind that I was never going to let my public title become my personal identity,"" he says. He embraced what he calls a sense of normalcy after he left office, going to movies and basketball games. A year or two after he left office, Pataki went to Madison Square Garden with a group of friends to see the Knicks play. And he wanted to stand in line to get himself a hot dog -- something elected officials tend not to do. ""I loved it,"" he says. Even though fellow fans recognized him and offered to let him jump the queue, Pataki waited in line for his hot dog with mustard and sauerkraut. ""I felt really good about the fact that it was just comfortable for me to be on line with the rest,"" he says. Pataki decided in the middle of his third term in office that he would not seek a fourth term. He left office in 2006, after 12 years as governor. Pope's resignation a new angle to a tough news beat . ""I had no doubts that this was the right decision for me, for my family, for the team that had worked so hard with me, and for the state,"" he says. Pataki now practices law at Chadbourne & Parke in New York, where he focuses on energy and environmental issues. He has enjoyed his return to the private sector. ""The transition for me was really not that difficult, to be perfectly honest,"" says Pataki. ""But it was time."" Deciding when it's time to leave can be tough, especially when top jobs are hard to find. In the corporate world, stepping down from a leadership role by choice is uncommon. ""It's almost unheard of,"" says Patricia Cook, CEO of the executive search firm Cook & Company. ""It's a very unusual event."" Experts in the business world wonder why an executive would relinquish a leadership role. Cook says she can't think of an instance when a CEO stepped down because he or she didn't feel up to the job. But health concerns can change the game. Pope Benedict XVI surprised the world Monday when he announced he would resign at the end of this month. He cited his age and his deteriorating strength in his statement: ""I have come to the certainty that my strengths, due to an advanced age, are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the Petrine ministry."" A Vatican spokesman said on Tuesday that Benedict is not suffering from a specific ailment. ""I was very surprised,"" says David Perry, associate professor of history at Dominican University. Even so, Perry knew resignation was possible -- even for a pope. ""From my perspective as a medievalist, it's not surprising that popes can resign,"" he says. Papal law makes clear that pontiffs can give up their roles. But that hasn't happened in nearly 600 years. Whatever Benedict's motivation for choosing to step down now, experts say that his legacy could depend on whether there will be an orderly succession. Career expert Nicole Williams stresses the importance of a clean exit in the corporate arena. ""Departing is what ends up being a very monumental and usually public occasion,"" she says. Regardless of an employee's years of loyalty and service, the final stretch is often what defines the person. ""What they remember is you leaving,"" says Williams. ""You're going to want to be remembered by this departure, so you want to control it versus it controlling you."" Geoff Hoffmann took over as chief executive officer of the search firm DHR International from his father. As someone who recently went through the transition process, and who advises companies on their plans, he says a leadership plan is the key to success. Opinion: Echoes of past in pope's resignation . ""One of the most important duties of a CEO is to make sure that the succession plan is in place, really from Day One,"" he says. ""Some of the best-run companies are really thoughtful with their succession planning."" Health and circumstance can contribute to a person's decision to step down from a job in any field. If a leader doesn't feel up to the task, experts say retirement makes sense. ""If we look at the corporate world, it really is about: Can the CEO execute the job at the level it needs to be done?"" says Susan Battley, founder and CEO of Battley Performance Consulting. From mental sharpness to memory, leaders need finely tuned skills to be at the top of their game. ""Effective leadership is all about being able to execute brilliantly,"" says Battley. Whether the person is in charge of a Fortune 500 company, or the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, leadership is exhausting. Since leaving office, Pataki and his wife spend as much time as they can at their farm in the Adirondack Mountains. He's still playing sports, like basketball, and watching them; he calls himself a long-suffering Jets fan. And he still appears on the political stage. He says: ""I do want to try to help out with advancing policies that are right for the future of the country."" As for the pope, a Vatican spokesman says he will likely retire to a monastery, where he will spend his time focused on prayer and reflection.","Benedict XVI is the first pope to retire in nearly 600 years; he says age is a factor .

"(CNN) -- Authors' voices can resound long after they're gone. For Alicky Sussman, that's the hardest part of living without her husband, Paul -- but it's also what's helping her cope with his sudden death. Readers have his latest book to digest. And for his literary team, there is the painful dilemma of what to do with an unpublished manuscript. Paul Sussman was a crime-fiction author whose books have sold more than 2 million copies. His latest, ""The Labyrinth of Osiris,"" came out just weeks after he died at 45 from a ruptured aneurysm. It's the fourth in a series of thrillers set in the Middle East, against the backdrop of the region's ancient past. The idea that ""The Labyrinth of Osiris"" could be his last book is all the more poignant, because reviewers and editors alike say it's his best -- even Sussman agreed. Simon Taylor, editorial director at Transworld Publishers, says, ""He very rarely blew his own trumpet."" But after Sussman's most recent book was complete, his editor says he changed his tune. Taylor recalls: ""He turned to me and said, 'Simon, I do think perhaps I've written quite a good book here.' "" To which Taylor replied: ""It's bloody brilliant."" Promoting a book without an author presents unique challenges -- especially because Sussman took such an active role in publicizing his work. Taylor remembers Sussman riding around London on his motor scooter, with a publicist in tow, on his way to interviews to support his books. He joked that the writer terrified his passengers with his driving. But Sussman set himself apart by making time for all of the interview requests that came his way, no matter how small the publication. Now his book is getting noticed for its author's absence. ""In some ironic way, it (his death) got a little bit more attention for the book in the UK,"" says Morgan Entrekin, president of Grove/Atlantic, Sussman's U.S. publisher, ""as people wrote about the tragedy of his death and the fact that this was going to be his last book."" His widow didn't finish his latest book until after his death last year. Reading it now makes her miss him the most. ""Some of the turns of phrases that he uses are so quintessentially Paul,"" she says. ""There couldn't be anyone else who had written them."" She says she yearns to talk to him each time she finds one of the inside jokes he scatters throughout ""The Labyrinth of Osiris."" In all of his books, he includes characters named after people he and his wife know. ""I wish I'd been able to tell him I'd spotted them,"" she says. Sussman also wove his wife into all of his stories. Each book includes a character called Alexandra (Alicky's full name). His widow was amused to discover the circumstances of her namesake's appearance in the most recent book. The Alexandra figure relieves herself in the Valley of the Kings in Egypt. She then makes a gruesome discovery when she loses her footing and falls down a shaft. ""I think one of the really, really difficult things about losing someone is the conversation ending,"" Alicky says. ""And the person that you've been in the most amazing, wonderful conversation with -- suddenly that stops."" To keep the dialogue going, his widow writes letters to Sussman. She tells him about his two sons, ages 5 and 3, and what she's up to around their London home. ""All of those things that you would normally talk about,"" she says. She has a treasure trove of material that she can turn to when she wants to remember his voice. In addition to his books, Sussman kept 25 years' worth of diaries. And there is a book that even his most ardent fans haven't read yet. Before finding his niche in Middle Eastern detective thrillers, Sussman made his first foray into novel writing down quite a different path. His agent says she has a manuscript Sussman wrote more than 10 years ago. It's the story of a 100-year-old man who decides to kill himself, because he thinks he's lived long enough. In a suicide note, he confesses to 10 murders. But readers soon realize that the narrator isn't a murderer at all; rather, he just failed to prevent accidents. Along the way, they get a history of the 20th century. ""It's an absolutely hilarious book,"" says Laura Susijn, his longtime agent and friend. ""But it's painful because we all miss him so much."" (Sussman and I crossed paths briefly at CNN in London, where he worked about 10 years ago.) Susijn says the unpublished manuscript reflects its author even more than his subsequent novels, largely because it's so funny. But without Sussman, working on it would be heart-wrenching. His literary team also worries that introducing a new work too soon after his latest crime thriller's release could distract readers from the marketing campaign around his existing books. They focus on Sussman's background as an archaeologist, rather than his modern wit. Even so, publishing expert Ava Seave says she believes the manuscript should be published. ""If the product exists, you should get it out there,"" she says. The adjunct associate professor at Columbia Business School finds plenty of upsides to bringing out new material from an author who has passed away. ""I think it would be great if ... they can make a few bucks, or if they just want to make sure that the fans are happy,"" she says. As they mull over sharing his unpublished work with the world, his colleagues and friends find that Sussman lives on through his books. ""For me, he's very much alive,"" Susijn says. ""As his literary agent, I'm selling rights around the world."" His widow is taking a year off from her job as a documentary producer for the BBC in London. She is focusing on putting together a book of memories for her sons about their dad. She says she would also be keen to publish her husband's early manuscript -- in time. ""I want people to hear his voice,"" she says. For now, his readers can seek solace in Sussman's current collection. ""He knew how to tell a rip-roaring story,"" says Taylor of Transworld Publishers. But more than that, he left his friends and family happy with the time -- and the work -- that they got from him. ""That's basically his legacy,"" Susijn says. ""You would always feel better having spent time with Paul."" Do you think it's a good or bad idea to publish an author's work posthumously? Give your take in the comments section below.","Best-selling author Paul Sussman, 45, died last year from a ruptured aneurysm .

Hasbro, maker of the board game available in 111 countries and 43 languages, is replacing one of the tokens with one ""that's more representative of today's Monopoly players,"" according to Eric Nyman, senior vice president for Hasbro Gaming. In a campaign replete with marketing genius and every cliche you can think of, Hasbro is encouraging fans of a special Facebook page to vote daily until February 5 for the token they want to save and for the one they want added. New choices are a diamond ring, guitar, toy robot, cat or helicopter. The game was introduced by Parker Brothers in 1935 during the heart of the Great Depression. According to Hasbro, which bought the company, more than 1 billion people have played the game in its various versions. Some tokens are long gone, among them the lantern, cannon and rocking horse. The winning token will make its debut in mid- to late 2013. The classic token with the fewest votes will get the boot. Ironic if that turns out to be the shoe. ""Fans who would still like to play with the classic eight tokens have a limited time to pick up the existing version of the game,"" said Hasbro. Comments on the ""Save Your Token"" Facebook page were hot and heavy. ""Get rid of the iron and bring in the kitty,"" one commenter said. ""That way the dog will have something to chase around the board."" Others pleaded for the game to be left alone. Some, including Jan Blackstock Harville, waxed nostalgic while looking ahead.

"Istanbul (CNN) -- Turkey's long-simmering war with a Kurdish insurgency has escalated over the last year, reaching death tolls unseen in more than a decade, a new report focusing on the conflict says. ""Turkey's Kurdish conflict is becoming more violent, with more than 700 dead in fourteen months, the highest casualties in thirteen years,"" concluded the International Crisis Group, a conflict resolution organization that has extensively researched Turkey's war with the Kurdistan Workers Party, or PKK. ""We're seeing the longest pitched battles between the army and the PKK, we're seeing a wide-spread campaign of kidnapping, suicide bombings and terrorist attacks by the PKK. They're very much on the offensive and unfortunately this is matched by much harder line rhetoric on both sides,"" added Hugh Pope, the chief author of the International Crisis Group report, in an interview with CNN. 115 Kurdish rebels killed in 14 days . Last weekend alone, at least eight Turkish police officers and four soldiers were killed in two separate ambushes in southeastern Turkey. The PKK promptly claimed responsibility for both attacks. The Turkish government, meanwhile, claims to have killed hundreds of PKK fighters in recent months, both in operations in southeastern, predominantly Kurdish-populated Turkey and during air raids against suspected PKK camps in the mountains of northern Iraq. ""Within the last month, in the operations executed throughout the region, about 500 terrorists were eliminated,"" Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a speech Monday. ""We will on the one hand develop Turkey and on the other hand continue to tirelessly struggle against this terrorist organization that has bloody hands."" The escalation of violence and hard-line rhetoric on both sides has jeopardized hopes of bringing an end to a conflict that has bedeviled Turkey for 30 years. It also threatens to destabilize a member of the NATO military alliance that is already grappling with the influx of more than 80,000 refugees fleeing the civil war in neighboring Syria. For decades, the Turkish state discriminated against the Kurds, Turkey's largest ethnic minority, which now makes up roughly 20% of the population. The Kurdish language was banned, and Kurds were long referred to as ""mountain Turks."" The PKK, led by one of its founders, Abdullah Ocalan, launched a bloody campaign to carve out an independent homeland for Kurds from Turkey, as well as neighboring Iran, Iraq and Syria, in the 1980s. The conflict killed more than 30,000 people, most of them ethnic Kurds. The war that raged across southeastern Turkey subsided when the PKK declared a unilateral cease-fire for several years after Ocalan was captured in 1999. In 2005, Erdogan's government began secret talks with PKK leaders. His Justice and Development Party, or AKP, also made a number of overtures toward the Kurds, relaxing bans on Kurdish language education, appearing to apologize for past discriminatory policies and launching a state Kurdish-language TV station. ""The AKP government actually did more for the Kurds than anyone up until now,"" Pope said. ""[But] when a wave of massive arrests of legitimate Kurdish politicians began, that's when I think young people especially lost hope and the PKK's arguments for the legitimacy of armed struggle became persuasive to them."" Turkish authorities have arrested thousands of Kurdish activists, intellectuals and politicians in the past several years. Many of those targeted are members of the Peace and Democracy Party, or BDP, a legal Kurdish political party that elected 29 members to parliament on independent ballots in 2011. According to this month's International Crisis Group report, those arrested ""include elected deputies, mayors (some from major cities and districts), provincial councilors, party officials and ordinary activists. Many have been accused of membership in a terrorist organization, but not of committing any violent act."" Last week, 44 journalists and media workers from Kurdish news outlets appeared in an Istanbul courthouse on terrorism charges. Many of them have been awaiting trial in prison since their arrest last December. ""This is to silence the opposition,"" said Baran Dogan, one of the defense attorneys in the case. ""This is not only about press freedom but also an intervention into a citizen's right to choose where to get news from."" In fact, in recent weeks, Turkey's fiery prime minister has publicly urged the Turkish media not to report on the growing number of Turkish casualties in the conflict, drawing criticism from media freedoms groups. ""Erdogan's most recent televised 'message to all the media' crosses from reprimanding into directly instructing journalists to stop covering the long-standing conflict between the Turkish Armed Forces and the outlawed Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK). This is unthinkable,"" the New York-based Committee to Protect Journalists said in a news release this week. One of the major obstacles to the peace process, however, is the position staked out by the leaders of the Kurdish movement in Turkey. Video emerged last month showing several BDP lawmakers embracing and celebrating with armed PKK fighters in the mountains of southeastern Turkey. The scene provided further ammunition for critics who accuse the party of being a public face for the armed rebels. The International Crisis Group report also points out that the BDP has essentially marginalized itself from negotiations with the Turkish government. ""The BDP says 'don't negotiate with us, negotiate with Abdullah Ocalan in prison,' "" said Pope, the report's chief author. Members of the party insist they do not have the power to persuade PKK fighters to lay down their weapons. ""We are not an armed group. If we tell them (the PKK) to lay down arms, will they obey?"" Meral Danis Bestas, deputy chairwoman of the BDP, said in a phone interview with CNN. Over the last decade, Turkey succeeded in forging alliances with neighboring Iran, Syria and Iraq to target Kurdish rebels operating in their respective territories. But Turkey's relations with all three governments have deteriorated sharply over the past several years, and the conflict threatens to spill across borders. This month, Turkish warplanes repeatedly bombed suspected PKK camps in the mountains of northern Iraq. Meanwhile, Turks watched with alarm this summer as members of the Syrian branch of the PKK raised the guerilla movement's flag over several predominantly Kurdish towns along Syria's border with Turkey. Should Turkey be afraid of the Syrian Kurds? This has led to accusations from Ankara that Syria and its ally Iran are providing support to the PKK, charges denied by both Damascus and Tehran. ""If Turkey feels vulnerable to empowered Kurds in Syria, the only way to defend itself is to solve its domestic Kurdish problem,"" said Pope, the International Crisis Group report author. The report urged the Turkish government to expand Kurdish language education, redefine Turkey's broad definition of terrorism and launch a package of measures for reintegration of former Kurdish insurgents. The group also appealed to Kurdish leaders to drop demands for a ""self-defence militia"" in Kurdish areas of Turkey. One hope for resolution of the conflict may lie in an effort to rewrite Turkey's constitution. The document was drafted by a military junta that swept into power in a coup in 1980. Kurdish lawmakers have joined with Erdogan's party, as well as two other parties represented in the Turkish parliament, to write a new version of the constitution. But these reform efforts are being overshadowed by deadly, daily attacks in southeastern Turkey. On Tuesday morning, Turkish television showed smoke billowing from a burning bus after a suspected PKK attack on a military convoy in eastern Bingol province. According to Mustafa Hakan Guvencer, the governor of Bingol, the targeted convoy included buses carrying ""200 military personnel returning from their vacations unarmed and dressed in civilian clothes."" The governor said the ambush killed at least 10 soldiers and wounded at least 60.

"(CNN) -- One of the most memorable Super Bowl ads in recent years starred a pint-size Darth Vader attempting to use the force all over his house, finally succeeding, or so he thought, in starting his dad's car. These days the boy behind the Vader mask is strictly using his force for good. Max Page, the 8-year-old actor who stole audience's hearts in the 2011 Volkswagen ad, was born with a rare congenital heart defect and has undergone eight surgeries, most recently last summer. But his medical problems haven't dampened his spirit. As head of the Junior Ambassadors Program for Children's Hospital Los Angeles, Max has dedicated much of his young life to raising awareness and funds for other kids in need. Or as he says, ""It's the first time Darth Vader's been good, so that might be a little change."" Max had his first surgery at 3 months old after being diagnosed with Tetralogy of Fallot. The congenital heart defect, which changes the normal flow of blood through the heart, occurs in about five out of every 10,000 babies, according to the National Institute of Health. Max's charitable efforts began almost as soon as his medical troubles did. By the time of his first birthday, he had already endured four surgeries. His parents, Jennifer and Buck Page, said they felt grateful to the families who came before them and others who donated to keep the Los Angeles hospital and neonatal intensive care unit open. ""We feel a tremendous responsibility to make sure the doors stay open for us and families that follow us and to do our part,"" Jennifer Page says. Every year, Max and his younger brother Els, 7, pick a charity and ask for donations in place of presents for either of them. ""We've raised over $50,000 over the years for charity causes of all kinds. Now everyone looks forward to what the boys are going to do,"" Jennifer Page says. Max's fame from the Super Bowl ad has widened the family's reach and strengthened his impact. ""Hopefully, I can just use my force for even better good, and I hope that it works,"" he says. The vivacious youngster regularly speaks and campaigns for Children's Hospital Los Angeles as well as smaller organizations such as Saving Tiny Hearts in Chicago. Max also visits children in the hospital and has become something of a role model. He takes his responsibility seriously since he also looks up to someone -- snowboarder Shaun White. He has yet to meet the Olympic gold medalist, but he says he will have a lot of questions when he does. His mom watched White compete in the Olympics the same year Max was first diagnosed, and after hearing from doctors about the limitations her son would face, she says she found hope in White, who has the same heart defect. ""I remember watching, and the significance for me was that Max could have energy. We could actually focus on hope that Max could have energy, and it was actually possible,"" she says. She adds, ""I looked at what his (White's) parents must have had to do to let him live so free. Because I just want to wrap Max up in bubble wrap and not let anything touch him. And they didn't. Shaun White's parents said go for it"" It's been seven months since Max's last surgery -- an open heart pulmonary valve replacement -- and he has been cleared for all activities by his doctors. He's back campaigning for the hospital, and he's learned to snowboard and also plays Little League Baseball. Soon he'll even return to his role on the CBS soap ""The Young and the Restless."" In his own words, ""I'm back to being me."" His mother says that she and his father try to lead by example but attributes much of the boy's positive attitude to Max himself. ""There's just this innateness in him that says I'm going to fight, I'm going to conquer it, I'm going to win. From the very beginning, he's had to fight. From his very first breath, he's had to fight hard for every breath, and ... I think that is just part of his nature."" While he was the breakout star of a previous Super Bowl, this year Max will be watching the game at home with his family. He says he's a bit overwhelmed with his two favorite teams competing against each other. ""I'll win and I'll lose. So I'm not going to root for anyone,"" Max says. ""I'm just going to hope it's a good match.""","Max Page of Super Bowl ad fame has a congenital heart disease .

"(CNN) -- Apple CEO Tim Cook expects China, the world's most populous country, to become the No. 1 market for the company. Equally heavyweight tech companies Google or Facebook can only watch with envy. It is not because of lack of effort that they are nowhere near the success of Apple in China. Their businesses are just too different. The Chinese government's tight control on freedom of information flow applies especially to the Internet. Web access is filtered on a regular basis. Social media websites such as Facebook and Twitter are blocked because the government deems them as potential hot spots for facilitating politically sensitive or socially inappropriate content. Meanwhile, Google is operational in China but has to route all searches to its Hong Kong site, and the access is often interrupted. So, it is fair to say that the Chinese government is the reason why companies such as Google and Facebook are not doing well in China. In contrast, Apple mainly sells hardware, so it has not run into any censorship problems. Chinese consumers love electronic gadgets. Mobile phones are ubiquitous. Apple is doing incredibly well because its products are so much more attractive and pricy. The iPhone quickly become a status symbol product in Chinese social circles since its debut. Likewise, the iPad also joined the must-have list as soon as it was launched. If someone wants to lubricate his ""guanxi"" -- relationship -- with an important person, these two products are often the gift of choice. Before the iPad reached China, a businessman in Shanghai told me that in the back of his car trunk, he had stocked at least 20 iPads, all bought in Hong Kong. ""It is the most-loved present for government officials,"" he claimed. The social pressure of having an Apple product is strong, especially as the wealthy elites set the trend. If a middle class Chinese consumer cannot afford an expensive car or watch, sporting an iPhone may be just as good. Even the bad press surrounding Foxconn, the main manufacturer of Apple products, did not make too much of a dent on the company's sales. There is no doubt that China will be an important market for Apple in the coming years. Among the three main telecommunications companies in the country, China Mobile is the only one without Apple's iPhone support despite the fact that it is the largest operator with nearly 700 million subscribers. Many high-end China Mobile customers still stay in 2G network because China Mobile's 3G network does not have iPhones. If China Mobile gets its own version of iPhone, as rumor has it recently, then it would be a shot in the arm for Apple. Interestingly enough, Apple's growth in China is all from its hardware. Its iTunes store sales from music, videos, books or apps downloads are almost negligible. This has nothing to do with the government. There is no censorship of iTunes other than Apple's own self-screening mechanism. Poor sales from iTunes store owe more to the fact that the Chinese are habitually reluctant to pay for intellectual properties. To make things worse, there are so many websites that offer ""jailbreak"" tips so that people can easily bypass Apple and get free downloads elsewhere. There are rumors that Apple might consider adding a cheaper version of the iPhone for the Chinese market. In light of the fast growing smartphone market, cheaper phones seem to make sense especially since there are still millions of Chinese who cannot afford a pricy iPhone of 5000 yuan (roughly $800 dollars). But Apple should stay away from the idea. It does not make sense to sacrifice profit margin just for a greater market share. Doing so would tarnish the premium image of Apple and erode the love and loyalty of the elites. One lesson that Apple can learn is that not long ago, Nokia used to own the Chinese market but it became so popular that it lost its appeal to the elites. Nokia ended up trying a new brand, Vertu, to entice consumers, but it was not very successful. By building more retail stores in China, Apple would certainly accelerate its growth. But the challenge is to maintain its prestige so that consumers would not lose interest and crave for a new elite brand. Apple might also want to rethink its iTunes Store business model in China so that it can generate sales in other ways. Hardware comes and goes. One day, Apple products can and will be replaced. But demand for books, movies, music, and apps is ongoing. Will Apple find a way to tap into the Chinese consumption for content? We'll just have to see. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Jeongwen Chiang.","Apple CEO Tim Cook expects China to become the No. 1 market for the company .

"(CNN) -- A drummer for country music star Kellie Pickler was seriously injured in a pileup crash on Interstate 65 in Kentucky, officials said. Gregg Lohman, 36, was airlifted from the crash site Saturday with head and neck injuries, Master Trooper Norman Chaffins of Kentucky State Police told CNN affiliate WAVE. Lohman was in critical but stable condition Sunday at a Louisville hospital. Pickler confirmed the crash on her Facebook page Sunday: . ""Yesterday, my drummer Gregg Lohman was in a horrific car accident and is currently in ICU,"" the ""Red High Heels"" singer wrote. ""Gregg is not just my drummer, he is family. I believe in miracles and the power of prayer, so it would mean the world to me, my band, and Gregg's family if you would please keep him in your prayers. Thank y'all so much."" Lohman had slowed down for an earlier, fiery crash on the interstate when another driver failed to notice the slowed traffic and crashed into the back of Lohman's truck, police told WAVE. Lohman's truck then hit another vehicle, which rear-ended yet another. Six people from the same family were killed in the initial, fiery crash, WAVE said. Two others were injured in the pileup crash involving Lohman, but both were treated and released.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- A diplomatic row has erupted between Japan and China after a group of Chinese nationals were photographed raising flags on a disputed island in the East China Sea before being arrested, the latest incident in rising territorial tensions in North Asia. Japanese authorities on Wednesday arrested 14 Chinese activists at the disputed islands. ""We will deal with the issue sternly based on the law,"" Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda told reporters Wednesday night, as Japan's foreign ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador to protest strongly what it called an illegal landing. In a press conference, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Osamu Fujimura said, ""Senkaku Islands are our sovereign territory historically and in the international law. We are controlling the islands effectively."" He said the activists were given repeated warnings and that their landing was ""very regrettable."" China says it has sovereignty over the East China Sea islands, which it calls Diaoyu, and has urged Japan to immediately release the detained citizens. On Wednesday Vice Foreign Minister Fu Ying summoned the Japanese ambassador and phoned her Japanese counterpart to ""lodge solemn representation over Japan's illegal arrest,"" according to the Chinese Foreign Ministry. In Hong Kong, Chief Executive C.Y. Leung summoned Japanese Consul-General Yuji Kumamaru, expressing similar ""extreme"" concern. Hong Kong is a special administrative region of China. Five of the men who landed on the islands were taken into custody by Okinawa police, while the nine others on the vessel were detained by the Japan Coast Guard. At least six are from Hong Kong, including former Legislative Council member ""Bull"" Tsang Kin-shing, according to the Hong Kong Immigration Department, which on Thursday sent two officers to Okinawa, Japan, where the group is being detained. Leading the activists is the Hong Kong-based Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands. In addition to Tsang, the group included a labor union chairman, a teacher, two TV journalists and seven crew members, according to lists provided by the police and coast guard. The Hong Kong-registered fishing vessel, which had set sail on Sunday, was detained and the men charged with violating the immigration control and refugee recognition act, according to Japanese and Hong Kong authorities. According to the Hong Kong group's Twitter account, they planned to demolish the Japanese lighthouse on the island, sing the national anthem and set up a television and radio to receive Chinese broadcasts. A tweet three hours later reassured readers of their safety and eventual return after being ""invited to stay in Okinawa overnight to have sushi and ramen."" A picture of the activists showed a Taiwan flag being borne; it was not clear whether the self-identified Chinese nationals included anyone from Taiwan, which China considers a renegade province. The arrests have led to anti-Japanese protests in Shanghai, Hong Kong and Beijing. The Wednesday incident coincided with the 67th anniversary of Japan's official World War II surrender. On the same day, two Japanese Cabinet ministers visited the controversial Yasukuni shrine in Tokyo, which honors Japan's war dead as well as war criminals. China and South Korea, given their respective wartime occupation and colonization by Japan, have condemned such visits. Adding to the regional tensions before the anniversary was South Korean President Lee Myung-bak's visit to what the country calls Dokdo, a small group of islets that Japan claims as Takeshima. The move prompted Japan to recall its ambassador to Seoul. On Tuesday, Lee said in remarks to teachers that Japanese Emperor Akihito should make a ""sincere apology"" for suffering under Japanese colonial rule. The following day, amateur South Korean athletes, including the rock singer Kim Jang-hoon, swam in a 49-hour, 220-kilometer relay toward the island to mark the anniversary of their country's independence from Japan in 1945. CNN's Steven Jiang, Alexis Lai, Junko Ogura and Yoko Wakatsuki contributed to this report.","14 Chinese activists arrested by Japanese authorities at disputed islands .

"(CNN) -- North Korea's longtime leader Kim Jong Il, the embodiment of the reclusive state where his cult of personality is deeply entrenched, has died. He was believed to be 69. Regarded as one of the world's most-repressive leaders, Kim Jong Il always cut a slightly bizarre figure. His diminutive stature and characteristically bouffant hair have been parodied by some in the West. ""He's a mysterious person -- I think by design,"" said Han S. Park, director of the Center for the Study of Global Issues at the University of Georgia and a frequent visitor to North Korea. ""Mystery is a source of leverage and power. It's maintaining uncertainty."" But for the citizens of his Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Kim was well regarded. This Just In: Up-to-the-minute news on the death of Kim Jong Il . His father, Kim Il Sung, founded North Korea with Soviet backing after World War II. Kim Jong Il was just a little boy when the Communist North invaded the American-backed South, sparking the Korean War in 1950. After the fighting ended, Kim became steeped in his father's philosophy of ""juche"" or self-reliance -- the basis of North Korea's reclusive nature. North and South Korea never formally signed a peace treaty and remain technically at war -- separated by a tense demilitarized zone. North Korea gives Kim's official birthplace as sacred Mount Paektu. The peak, on the northern border with Chinese Manchuria, is the highest on the peninsula and the site where Korean legend says the nation came into existence 5,000 years ago. Cause of death reported to be ""overwork"" Researchers who are more objective place Kim's birth in the Far Eastern region of the Soviet Union on February 16, 1942. His father had fled to the Soviet Union when the Japanese put a price on his head for guerrilla activities in occupied Korea. The family returned to the northern part of the peninsula after the Japanese surrender in World War II, and Soviet dictator Josef Stalin anointed Kim Il Sung as the leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. Timeline: Kim Jong Il . Kim Jong Il's younger brother drowned as a child and his mother died when he was 7 years old. Shortly after, when the Korean War broke out , he was sent to Manchuria, returning three years later when it ended. Despite these hardships, Kim Jong Il was presumably surrounded by luxury and privilege for most of his upbringing. As the first-born son of an iron-fisted dictator, ""the doors were likely opening for him from a very young age,"" according to Dae-sook Suh, a professor of political science at the University of Hawaii who specializes in the Pyongyang government. TIME: The iconography of Kim Jong Il . Gradually Kim Jong Il was groomed for the top position, making public appearances in front of cheering crowds. In 1980, Kim Il Sung formally designated his son as his successor. Kim Jong Il was given senior posts in the Politburo, the Military Commission and the Party Secretariat. He took on the title ""Dear Leader"" and the government began spinning a personality cult around him patterned after that of his father, the ""Great Leader."" In 1991, Kim Jong Il became commander-in-chief of North Korea's powerful armed forces, the final step in the long grooming process. Three years later, when Kim Il Sung died suddenly from a heart attack at 82, most outsiders predicted the imminent collapse of North Korea. The nation had lost its venerated founding father. Just a few years earlier, its powerful alliances had evaporated with the fall of the Soviet bloc and China's move toward a market-based system. The economy was on the rocks and energy and food were in short supply. A series of weather disasters, combined with an inefficient state-run agricultural system, further eroded the food supply, leading to mass starvation. The timing could not have been worse for replacing the only leader North Korea had known. ""Heaven didn't smile on Kim Jong Il,"" said the University of Hawaii's Dae-sook Suh. After his father's elaborate public funeral, Kim Jong Il dropped out of sight, fueling rumors, but he soon managed to consolidate power. Zakaria: Will the North Koreans rise up? Under his newly organized government, his father's presidential post was left vacant and Kim took the titles of general secretary of the Workers Party and chairman of the National Defense Commission -- a group of 10 men that includes the heads of the air force, army and navy, who are now considered the most powerful in the country. ""It's a peculiar government to say the least,"" Dae-sook Suh said. ""He honors the legacy of his father, but the new government is a Kim Jong Il government. It's quite different from his father's."" Kim Il Sung's unique style of Stalinism was subordinated to the more militant theme of Kim Jong Il's ""Red Banner"" policy, introduced in 1996. The changes afoot were dramatically illustrated in 1997 by the defection of Hwang Jang Yop -- the architect of the juche philosophy and the first high-level official to seek asylum in South Korea. In a news conference after his defection, Hwang warned of a growing possibility that his homeland might launch an attack. ""The preparation for war exceeds your imagination,"" he said. Many outsiders viewed the flight of Hwang as another sign that the North Korean regime was on its last legs, but once again it weathered the storm, perhaps even benefiting from the fears of war heightened by Hwang's warning. Despite sending a test missile over Japan in June 1999 and other such incidents, North Korea under Kim Jong Il also sent signals that it is open to new alliances after decades of isolation. Billions of dollars in international aid poured into North Korea during the 1990s, which did little in return. Many analysts conclude that Kim Jong Il has played a poor hand of cards skillfully. ""I tend to disregard rumors that he's irrational, a man that nobody can do business with,"" said Alexander Mansourov, a longtime Korea scholar and a former Russian diplomat who was posted in Pyongyang in the late 1980s. ""I believe that he is smart. He's pragmatic. And I think he can be ruthless. He's a man who will not loosen his grip in any way on the people around him."" His obsession for movies led to one of the strangest incidents associated with him: The 1978 kidnappings of South Korean actress Choi En-hui and her director husband Shin Sang-ok. The couple's account of their ordeal, given after they escaped North Korea in 1986, sounds like a B-movie script. They said Kim Jong Il held Choi under house arrest and imprisoned Shin for four years for a failed escape attempt. Kim then forced them to work in the North Korean film industry, paying them handsomely while keeping them in the gilded cage of his artistic and social circles. Although the country was having problems paying its debts, Kim lived extravagantly and spent tens of millions of dollars on their film productions, according to Choi and Shin. The couple told Washington Post reporter Don Oberdorfer that Kim was a ""micro-manager"" who made all the major decisions in North Korea because of his father's ailing condition. Shin described Kim as ""very bright,"" but said that he had no sense of guilt about his misdeeds ""due to his background and upbringing."" While the Dear Leader is said to have indulged his appetite for the finer things, his people were literally starving to death. The collapse of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s hit North Korea hard when guaranteed trade deals with Moscow came to an end. And then devastating floods compounded the famine. The North Korean regime admitted almost 250,000 people perished between 1995 and 1998, but some outside groups believe it was more like ten times that figure. Nevertheless, an artifice of a successful state was maintained in the capital, Pyongyang, including an opulent subway -- proof that Kim would say reflected North Korea's progress under his and his father's leadership. In 2000, there appeared to be a thaw in North-South relations leading to the first-ever summit meeting between Kim Jong Il and his then counterpart from the South President Kim Dae Jung. South Korea's so-called ""sunshine policy"" of engagement seemed to be bearing fruit. But Kim Jong Il pressed ahead with his nuclear weapons program and then-U.S. President George W. Bush labeled North Korea as part of the ""axis of evil"" in his 2002 State of the Union address. A year later, North Korea withdrew from the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. In 2006, the North conducted a nuclear test and test fired missiles adding extra urgency to the six-party talks designed to deal with North Korea's nuclear program. A breakthrough came in 2007, when Kim Jong il finally agreed to disable the nuclear reactor at Yongbyon in return for fuel and better relations with the U.S. But despite dramatically blowing up Yongbyon's cooling tower, North Korea seemed to backtrack afterwards and the deal appeared to be jeopardy. In August 2008, Pyongyang halted the disabling of the plutonium-producing plants in after a stalemate over verification measures. Months later -- as Bush wrapped up his final term in office -- the U.S. government agreed to take North Korea off its list of countries that sponsor terrorism. The move was a turnaround from the Bush administration's previous refusal to drop North Korea from the list until Pyongyang agreed to set up an internationally recognizable mechanism to verify it was revealing all its nuclear secrets. Analysts say it is easy for outsiders to demonize Kim Jong Il, a dictator who spent an estimated 25% or more of his country's gross national product on the military while many in his country went hungry. But in North Korea, closed off from outside influences, fearful of threats from its neighbors, and subjected to decades of political socialization on top of a long tradition of a strict hierarchical system, Kim Jong Il is viewed positively by most people, said Han Park of the Center for Study of Global Issues. ""The level of reverence for Kim Jong Il in North Korea is quite underestimated by the outside,"" Park said. ""He is regarded by many as not only a superior leader but a decent person, a man of high morality. Whether that's accurate is not important if you want to deal with North Korea. You have to understand their belief system. Perception is reality."" But to the outside world, Kim Jong Il will be remembered as one of the worst despots in history, according to Andre Lankov, an author on Korea's history. ""He will be remembered as a person who was responsible for awful things: for the existence of one of the worst dictatorships in not only Korean history but the world history at least in the 20th and 21st centuries,"" Lankov said. ""Yet he did not create this dictatorship -- it was his father's but he took responsibility, and he made sure it continued for many more years."" CNN's Dan Rivers contributed to this report.","Kim Jong Il took over when his father died of a heart attack in 1994 .

"(CNN) -- A Wisconsin judge ruled there is enough evidence for four women to stand trial for their roles in a staged motel tryst that ended with a man tied to a bed, his penis super-glued to his stomach, a lawyer for one of the women said Wednesday. Michelle Belliveau, Wendy Sewell, Therese Ziemann and the man's wife appeared in court Tuesday. A Calumet County Circuit Court Judge issued the ruling Tuesday after hearing from the alleged victim, who spent about 90 minutes on the witness stand describing his ordeal, attorney Rob Bellin said. The 37-year-old man, who is in custody on charges in an unrelated case, delivered his testimony wearing an orange jailhouse jumpsuit. ""I was telling them they couldn't do this, that it's assault. Hello, let me leave,"" the alleged victim said, according to CNN affiliate WBAY. The man's wife and two of his girlfriends hatched a plot to lure him to a Stockbridge motel on July 30 and confront him after learning that he was having ""sexual relations"" with all of them, a criminal complaint states. Therese Ziemann, Wendy Sewell, Michelle Belliveau and the man's wife are accused of felony false imprisonment, which carries a maximum penalty of six years in prison. Ziemann, who is also accused of misdemeanor sexual assault and battery, faces arraignment on October 5. Belliveau pleaded not guilty on Tuesday, and the others have motion hearings scheduled in October. CNN does not name victims of alleged sexual assault and will not name the alleged victim's wife since they use the same last name. Ziemann told investigators that her lover's wife contacted her the day before the incident and revealed that he was married with children and seeing other women for money. Ziemann said she confirmed the information with Sewell, and the three arranged to confront him ""without him knowing,"" the complaint says. Belliveau, Ziemann's sister, was allegedly also present. The man went to the hotel on July 30 to meet Ziemann, who told investigators that she met him on Craigslist and fell in love, paying for their hotel rooms and lending him $3,000, the complaint says. The alleged victim told police that when he arrived, Ziemann told him she wanted to ""tie him up and give him a rub down."" She used bed sheets to tie him to the bed, and blindfolded him with a pillowcase before cutting off his underwear with scissors, according to the complaint. She then texted the other women to let them know ""he's tied up."" After they arrived, they peppered him with questions like, ""which do you love more?"" and ""who do you want to grow old with?"" Ziemann told police she slapped her lover and asked ""can you handle that?"" before using Krazy Glue to stick his penis to his stomach. The man told police that the women took his wallet, cell phone and car and left him tied to the bed. He chewed on the bindings to free himself and eventually called police. The man, who has a criminal record in Wisconsin dating back to 1998, is in custody on unrelated charges of child abuse, theft and harassment. His next court appearance in that case is scheduled for Thursday, September 17.","Wisconsin judge rules there is sufficient evidence for women to stand trial .

"London (CNN) -- Argentinian President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner is once again calling on the UK to hand back the Falkland Islands -- known in Argentina as Las Malvinas -- accusing Britain of blatant colonialism. In an open letter to British Prime Minister David Cameron, which was published in the British press, she says that Britain stripped the islands away from Argentina 180 years ago on Thursday's date: January 3. Read more: Falkland Islands will vote on political status . The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982, when the then-Argentinian military government landed troops on the islands. Argentina put its death toll from the conflict at around 645. Britain's civil and military losses amounted to 255. Falklands war wounds still fresh, 30 years later . In the letter, which was copied to U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Argentinian president writes: ""The Argentines on the Islands were expelled by the Royal Navy and the United Kingdom subsequently began a population implantation process similar to that applied to other territories under colonial rule. ""Since then, Britain, the colonial power, has refused to return the territories to the Argentine Republic, thus preventing it from restoring its territorial integrity."" She quotes a 1965 U.N. resolution inviting the two countries to negotiate a solution to the sovereignty dispute and calls on the British to abide by the resolution. Read more: Why tensions are rising over Falklands . Located in the South Atlantic Ocean, about 480 kilometers (298 miles) east of the tip of South America, the Falklands have long been coveted as a strategic shipping stopover and potential wellspring of natural resources. The Falklands, which raise their own taxes but rely on the United Kingdom for defense and foreign policy, are one of 14 British overseas territories and have been under British rule since 1833. Read more: Chavez, allies call for sanctions against Britain over Falklands . The British government swiftly rejected the idea of negotiations, saying the Falkland Islanders have chosen to be British. In a statement, the British Foreign Office said the islanders remain free to choose their own futures and ""have a right to self-determination as enshrined in the U.N. Charter. This is a fundamental right for all peoples."" The statement added: ""There are three parties to this debate, not just two as Argentina likes to pretend. The islanders can't just be written out of history. ""As such, there can be no negotiations on the sovereignty of the Falklands Islands unless and until such time as the islanders so wish."" The islanders are due to hold a referendum on their political status this March but were also quick to dismiss the Argentinian position. Read more: What's behind renewed tensions? ""We are not a colony,"" said Barry Elsby, a member of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands. ""Our relationship with the United Kingdom is by choice."" The exchange comes amid rising tension over the islands, which are home to about 3,000 people. In February of last year, the Argentinian leader accused the British of militarizing the South Atlantic after the Royal Navy sent its warship HMS Dauntless to the region. Then, in June of 2012, Fernandez confronted Cameron at the G-20 meeting and tried to hand him a letter about the islands -- something he refused to accept. Argentinian leader denounces 'militarization' of the South Atlantic . The dispute flared again ahead of the London 2012 Olympics, when Argentina released a video boosting its Olympic team that was filmed on the islands. The advertisement showed Argentinian field hockey star Fernando Zylberberg training in the streets of Port Stanley in the Falklands. The video ends with the slogan: ""To compete on English soil, we train on Argentine soil.""","Argentina says Britain stripped the Falkland Islands away 180 years ago .

"(CNN) -- It will be former world No. 1 against former world No. 1 when Maria Sharapova lines up against Caroline Wozniacki in the women's final at Indian Wells on Sunday -- a tale of two careers that have headed in opposite directions. While Sharapova completed her recovery from longterm injury problems by completing her collection of grand slam titles at last year's French Open, Wozniacki is still waiting for her first major crown as she battles to remain among the game's top 10. Sharapova returned to second in the rankings following Friday's 6-4 6-3 semifinal victory over fellow Russian Maria Kirilenko, as another former No. 1 -- defending champion Victoria Azarenka -- slipped down after pulling out of her quarterfinal clash with Wozniacki due to an ankle injury. The Dane, meanwhile, battled into her third final in four years at the Californian hard-court tournament as she came from behind to overcome German fourth seed Angelique Kerber 2-6 6-4 7-5. ""Maria is a great competitor and fights for every point,"" Wozniacki said of her next opponent, who she thrashed in the 2011 semis on the way to winning the title. ""She plays very aggressively and tries to take every ball on the rise and plays very flat -- it's going to be very tough."" Sharapova, who won the desert event in 2006 and was runnerup last year, has a 4-2 advantage over the world No. 10 and won both their encounters after that Indian Wells defeat. ""Caroline is dangerous when she has the opportunities to open up the court and runs you side to side,"" said the 25-year-old, who will be seeking her 28th WTA title while Wozniacki aims for a 21st. The 22-year-old will try to stifle Sharapova's power game on a surface that suits her patient baseline approach. ""I really enjoy this tournament -- I think it shows,"" Wozniacki said. ""I think the court suits me very well. I like that it goes fast through the air but it's a pretty slow court. ""It's a game of chess out there -- if you play it here, you expect it here. 'Wait, is it short? Okay, go in and attack. Is it deep? You need to play deep back because you don't want her to attack.' ""It's a game of finding out where is the toughest for the opponent to get to the ball."" In the men's tournament, Rafael Nadal has reached his fourth successive final since making his comeback from longterm injury after beating sixth-seeded Czech Tomas Berdych 6-4 7-5 in the first of Saturday's semifinals. ""It's completely unexpected,"" said Nadal, who won two out of three clay events before heading to the U.S. ""To be in the final ... it's a big surprise but I'm here and I'm very, very happy."" The Spaniard will face Juan Martin del Potro, who eliminated World No 1. Novak Djokovic 4-6 6-4 6-4 to end the Serb's 22-match winning streak. ""He's a big challenge for me also,"" del Potro told reporters of Nadal. ""He will want to win this tournament, for sure, and it's going to be very interesting match."" Djokovic had won 17 matches since the start of the year, which included his run to a fourth Australian Open crown and the ATP title in Dubai. ""It happens,"" Djokovic told reporters. ""All the credit to my opponent today. He deserved to win because he was more composed in the important moments and he played the right shots. ""He stepped into the court, where, on the other side, me, I made a lot of unforced errors and was at back of the court too passive.

"San Francisco (CNN) -- Apple on Wednesday announced the latest version of the iPhone. The iPhone 5 looks similar to previous models but has a larger screen and is lighter and thinner than the iPhone 4S. The company says the larger screen will make it easier to check and send e-mails and to view Web pages with the phone in your hand. The phone also comes with a new, faster processor called the Apple A6, which connects to mobile carriers with a 4G LTE connection, making for speedier Internet browsing. ""It just screams,"" said Apple marketing chief Phil Schiller, in introducing the device. The iPhone 5 starts at $200 with a two-year mobile contract and will be available on September 21 in the United States. Pre-orders for the device begin on Friday. The iPhone 5 is 18% thinner and 20% lighter than the current version, the iPhone 4S. It has a 4-inch screen, measured diagonally, compared to a 3.5-inch screen on previous versions of the phone. It is the same width as the iPhone 4S, but taller, and the iPhone 5 is made entirely of glass and aluminum. Those features are likely to be popular with consumers. Another, however, may cause some backlash. The new iPhone comes with a different-sized charging cord, meaning speakers and radios designed to work with the old iPhone cord won't function seamlessly with the new iPhone. The company did create an adapter, however, so that the old devices aren't useless. Apple calls this new cord ""lightning,"" and says it is 80% smaller than the previous iPhone cord. During a press conference in San Francisco, Apple also announced an update to its mobile operating system, iOS 6, which accommodates the larger iPhone 5 screen. The new operating system adds another row of icons to the phone's home screen, includes a new, 3-D version of digital maps and has a feature called Passbook, which lets people pull up airline tickets or payment apps from the locked home screen. Apple also unveiled a new line of iPods, including an iPod nano with a 2.5-inch touchscreen. That device, which starts at $150, is able to pause live radio. And Apple updated its headphones, now called Earpods, with better audio quality and a new look. Read our live blog from the event here. For many tech fans, the fall Apple press event is the highlight of a season filled with gadget announcements and releases. Last week, Amazon unveiled its latest Kindle Fire tablets, and Nokia and Motorola announced new smartphones. HTC has an announcement scheduled for later in the month. The companies are rushing to get their products out in time for the holiday season, where they will battle it out for consumer dollars in an increasingly crowded mobile-device market. This is Apple's sixth iPhone model. Steve Jobs unveiled the first iPhone six years ago on a stage just one block away in the Moscone Center. Since then, the iPhone has taken off, selling about 244 million units around the world. According to research firm IDC, the iPhone and its iOS operating system make up 16.9% of the worldwide smartphone market, coming in behind all phones running the Android operating system, which account for 68.1% of the world's smartphones. The winning streak has carried over to Apple's stock price, which hit an all-time high of $683.29 a share last Friday. Some people weren't impressed with the new device, however. ""Apple doesn't innovate anymore,"" one commenter wrote on CNN's live blog from the event. ""They got where they are today by taking bold risks, but they are afraid to change anything that would affect their No. 1 product. Who could blame them?""","Apple unveiled a new iPhone Wednesday at an event in San Francisco .

"(CNN) -- While the Academy gets ready to crown the best films of the past year, we've got something else for your consideration. From ""The Avengers 2"" to ""World War Z,"" CNN Entertainment presents your guide to the biggest, best and buzziest movies of 2013. Comic Book Heroes . Comic book franchises will be flying by us faster than a speeding bullet this year, from a reboot of the Superman series (replacing Brandon Routh from ""Superman Returns"" with Henry Cavill for ""Man of Steel"" June 14) to the set-in-Japan ""The Wolverine"" July 26 to ""Thor: The Dark World"" November 8. But topping all of these on the anticipation meter (and hitting theaters first on May 3) is ""Iron Man 3,"" which brings Tony Stark back from the epic team-up of ""The Avengers."" It also kicks off the next phase of Marvel movie standalones like ""Thor"" and ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" that lead into ""The Avengers 2."" The stakes are more personal for Stark this time out, and although comic book fans will recognize the classic characters, Stark's got new on-screen villains to contend with such as Eric Savin/Coldblood, played by James Badge Dale. ""The level of security that I got to go through to learn my own lines is out of control,"" Dale told CNN. ""They have a Marvel security guy whose job it is to run around and find photographers hiding in the forest."" Hence the minimal leaks. Still, if 2012 is any indication, it's safe to say we'll all be watching. Funny Guys . Will Ferrell, Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carell will be back in ""Anchorman: The Legend Continues"" on December 20, just in time to keep San Diego classy for Christmas. Of his dim-witted character Brick Tamland, Steve Carell said that he hopes he hasn't changed at all since the first film, which came out in 2004. ""I think it's such a great ensemble piece that I would hope that our roles are the same as they were the first time around,"" Carell said. ""The storyline is going to be different, but I hope the people in it are exactly the same."" ""Great"" Books . ""Oz: The Great and Powerful,"" ""The Great Gatsby,"" ""Great Expectations"" -- sense a theme there yet? All of these films based on classic literature have, well, great expectations associated with them, but the anticipation around the Charles Dickens story starring Helena Bonham Carter as Miss Havisham has dimmed a bit since its U.K. release (Its release in the United States is TBD). Then ""The Great Gatsby"" had its release date shuffled from December 2012 to May 10, 2013, curtailing potential Oscar nominations this time around (although the trailers still look promising). This leaves Sam Raimi's ""Oz"" film, out March 8, to take the lead. In this origin story, James Franco stars as the would-be wizard who leaves Kansas and lands in Oz where he meets a bevy of witches played by Mila Kunis, Rachel Weisz and Michelle Williams. ""It's otherworldly,"" Weisz said. ""It's not just a different country; it's like a different planet. Definitely not on Earth."" Young Adult . With no more ""Harry Potter"" or ""Twilight,"" movie studios have been scrambling to create new teen-oriented franchises, and only ""The Hunger Games"" has caught fire so far. The second installment of the series, due November 22, just wrapped shooting in Hawaii (the new Game, featuring survivors of Games past, has a water-and-jungle theme). Fans are eager to see Katniss' wedding dress, the clock-structure of the arena and the confrontation with President Snow. (Not to mention some extra kissing this time around!) But hot on the heels of ""Catching Fire"" are some worthy contenders, including boy-centric ""Ender's Game"" (out November 1), ""The Mortal Instruments: City of Bones"" (out August 23), and the first of the Caster Chronicles books to be adapted, ""Beautiful Creatures"" (out February 13). The latter two are good-versus-evil supernatural stories: ""Mortal Instruments"" is about half-angel demon hunters, or Shadowhunters, and ""Beautiful Creatures"" is about light and dark witches, or casters, who discover what they are during a ceremony at age 16. ""We've really loved everything we've seen so far in the film,"" said ""Beautiful Creatures"" co-author Kami Garcia. Audiences will likely love Emmy Rossum's take on the lollipop-wielding Ridley, who casts her siren spell with each lick. Space Odyssey . The first nine minutes of ""Star Trek Into Darkness,"" out May 17, are already showing in select theaters, which has amped up Trekkie speculation about plot points: Could this be a contemporary ""Wrath of Khan?"" Will Benedict Cumberbatch's mysterious ""John Harrison"" character become Khan? Pointing in this direction is the casting of Alice Eve as Carol Marcus, Kirk's long-lost love and inventor of the dangerously powerful Genesis device, which could turn uninhabitable worlds into class M planets suitable for humans but could also destroy all pre-existing life. Alfonso CuarÃ³n's ""Gravity,"" which features ""two people floating in space,"" as George Clooney put it, is also enticing. Clooney's co-star is Sandra Bullock, who dominates the film, and together, they are the two survivors of a damaged space station. Reports from early test screenings suggest the film, out October 18, is gorgeous and awe-inspiring, but also divisive along the lines of ""The Tree of Life."" Reboots . 2013 will see its fair share of familiar properties getting new life in the form of remakes and reboots. ""The Lone Ranger"" series (which has existed as radio and TV shows and several film incarnations) becomes a Gore Verbinski movie (out July 3) with Johnny Depp and Armie Hammer aboard for a Tonto-centric story. Tom Clancy-created CIA agent Jack Ryan has been played by Alec Baldwin, Harrison Ford and Ben Affleck, and now Chris Pine is getting his turn, with a release date set for December 25. Sissy Spacek hands the ""Carrie"" baton over to ChloÃ« Grace Moretz on October 18. And Spike Lee's American remake of the South Korean thriller ""Oldboy,"" out October 11, stars Josh Brolin as an executive who has been mysteriously confined for years and is now freed, and sets out to find out who stole his life. Will there be any eating of live octopus like in the original? They're not saying, but producer Nathan Kahane promised other ""treats"" for fans. ""If you look carefully, you'll see some of the cast from the original,"" he said. Dragons . There's no competition for ""The Hobbit,"" the second installment of which is due out December 13 as the Dwarves get closer to their goal of reclaiming Erebor (after getting captured by both giant spiders and Elves). ""The Desolation of Smaug"" will feature Benedict Cumberbatch as the dragon Smaug. ""He's absolutely fantastic,"" gushed co-star Martin Freeman. Smaug will be the first performance-captured dragon, and thanks to advancements in technology, we should be able to see more emotion and musculature in his face in the same manner in which Gollum was improved for ""The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey,"" only on a much bigger scale. Also look for some more elf action in the second ""Hobbit"" film, with the return of Orlando Bloom as Legolas. Indie Darling . Ryan Gosling fans have three ways to see their favorite actor in 2013: in ""Gangster Squad,"" ""Only God Forgives"" and ""The Place Beyond the Pines."" The third of these, due March 29, reunites Gosling with his ""Blue Valentine"" director Derek Cianfrance and kicked off his romance with co-star Eva Mendes. The movie has been getting rave reviews on the festival circuit, even if Gosling's role as a motorcycle stunt rider who resorts to bank robbery sounds like a rehash of what he did in ""Drive."" This time, however, it's more of a family drama; Gosling really only carries one third of the film. (Meanwhile, ""Only God Forgives"" is a reunion with his ""Drive"" director Nicholas Winding Refn, but has yet to screen). Seeking a Friend for the End of the World . There won't be a bigger zombie apocalypse than ""World War Z,"" and it's got one of the biggest stars (Brad Pitt) to anchor it. Max Brook's book featured interviews from various survivors of the Zombie War, which gave both a time line and a sensation of the global nature of the catastrophe. Pitt's character has the unenviable job of tying up disparate storylines, but if anyone can do it, it's him. On the comedic side, it's a toss-up between Seth Rogen's directorial debut ""This Is The End,"" out June 14, and Edgar Wright's ""The World's End,"" out October 25. In ""This Is The End,"" an unspecified global cataclysm wipes out many famous actors playing themselves (including Michael Cera), so Rogen and friends hole up at James Franco's house and try to ride it out. ""We joke about (the potential for a sequel), but I don't know where it would exist,"" Rogen laughed. ""But they'll make a sequel out of anything. There's a script for ""Titanic 2"" lying around somewhere."" Then, in the bound-to-be-self-referencing ""World's End,"" Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and friends try to do a pub crawl on their last night alive. Fans of ""Shaun of the Dead"" and ""Hot Fuzz"" know this will be epic. Earth Exodus . What is it with all the films this year about Earth becoming an inhospitable planet? ""Elysium"" (starring Matt Damon, out March 1), ""Oblivion"" (starring Tom Cruise, out April 19), and ""After Earth"" (starring Will Smith, out June 7) share common themes, but only the first two seem to blame rampant corporatization and wealth discrepancies instead of nature. ""After Earth"" focuses on survival; ""Oblivion"" is about an underground resistance (led by Morgan Freeman). But ""Elysium,"" directed by Neil Blomkamp (of ""District 9"" fame) has the most socio-political overtones. In this scenario, the rich live on a luxurious new world called Elysium, and the poor live on Earth, which has become overpopulated, diseased and crime ridden. Damon's character fights to make a better life for himself, and inadvertently, everyone else.","The new year brings with it a host of eagerly awaited films .
They range from comic book adaptations to reboots .
Movies include ""Iron Man 3,"" ""Carrie"" and the second installment of ""The Hobbit"""
"(CNN) -- Neighbors expressed shock as details emerged Wednesday in the case of a 17-year-old Missouri boy found handcuffed to a stainless steel support pole in his family's basement. He had been there since September, police say. Friends and neighbors said the Kansas City teen was mentally challenged, and they were heartbroken to see him taken by ambulance to a hospital. ""You give birth to this child and you are going to handcuff it and lock it and not feed it and not give him water? How do you not take care of your child?"" said Ashley Reppy, who lives close to the family and spoke to CNN affiliate KSHB Wednesday. In a police report released Wednesday, officers described the victim as dressed in dirty clothes and his ""face was sunken in on the sides and his eyes had a look of desperation."" The teenager told police that he had been handcuffed in the basement since September, that he was unchained three times a day to go to the bathroom and that he was given only instant oatmeal, Ramen noodles and bologna sandwiches to eat. Reppy said she had often seen the victim sleeping on the front porch because his family wouldn't let him in the house. Her cousin reported the alleged abuse to a children's division hot line of the Missouri Department of Social Services, she said. The victim's older brother had told them that the victim had hit his mother and was ""on permanent house arrest,"" she said. ""We cried a lot yesterday because we're friends with him,"" Reppy told CNN affiliate WDAF. ""You know, three and a half months seems kind of long for him to not be in school,"" Reppy told KSHB. ""His friends would come over and knock on the door, and (the victim's stepmother) told them that he was out of town."" Kansas City Police spokesman Officer Darrin Snapp told CNN Wednesday that he could not comment on the case because it is still under investigation. Jim Roberts of the Clay County Prosecuting Attorney's Office said the victim's parents have not been charged. A digital camera and numerous photographs discovered at the home were sent to the Kansas City Regional Crime Lab. The victim was taken to the North Kansas City Hospital for further treatment before he was placed in the custody of the Clay County Children's Division, the police report said. A 2-year-old child also living at the residence was placed in state custody, authorities said. ""State law prohibits release of information specific to a case or individual, so I cannot confirm nor deny involvement in a case,"" Rebecca Woelfel, the communications director for the Missouri Department of Social Services, said in an e-mail to CNN. CNN's Michael Martinez contributed to this report.","The 17-year-old Kansas City boy was mentally challenged, neighbors say .

"(CNN) -- America is in trouble. And we know it. Just look at recent polls: 70% of Americans would describe the nation's economy as bad. Some 61% think our country is on the wrong track. Only 24% of Americans think the economy has actually improved in the past few years. And almost two-thirds of Americans are concerned about being able to pay for their housing. We could use Captain Economy to help us create jobs. Plus we need Deficit-Reduction Man and Five-Percent-GDP-Growth-a-Year Dude. Or maybe we can just let The Hulk loose in Congress and tell him: ""Hulk: Smash!"" (I'm not sure how Hulk smashing Congress helps the economy, but I think most of us would pay to see it.) But, alas, there's no superhero in no sight. There's only President Barack Obama or Mitt Romney. I must admit that there was a time in 2008 that I thought Obama could have been a superhero, but I was wrong. We have seen his campaign theme morph in four years from ""Yes We Can"" to ""It Could Be Worse."" In Obama's defense, his economic plan has helped the nation. Unemployment was at 10% in October 2009 and has fallen to 8.1%, and we have seen moderate job creation. But still the economy has a long way to go to match the booming growth years of the mid-2000s. We had a 4.6% unemployment rate just five years ago. So here comes superhero wannabe Romney. This silver-spooned crusader has attacked Obama by stating, ""We are enduring the most tepid recovery in modern history."" Romney essentially admits the economy has improved since Obama took office but claims that he has the super powers that will launch our nation to infinity and beyond. Or at least, as he promised this week, his economic plan would lower the nation's unemployment rate to 6% in four years. What's Romney's solution? His website outlines a proposal for economic recovery, promising a five-point plan that he will submit immediately upon taking office, then ""demand that Congress act on the package within 30 days."" But I think Romney might find that Congress won't be pushed around as easily as a blonde-haired kid in high school. All the ""demanding"" in the world might not get Congress to do what he wants. Romney: I'll get unemployment down to 6% . Romney calls for tax breaks for the wealthy and corporations, but his big push to revitalize the economy is to reduce the deficit by cutting government spending. Here is my question for Mr. Romney: Can you please show us where this type of austerity has worked before? I'm all ears. The most recent example is the United Kingdom, where conservative Prime Minister David Cameron slashed government spending in 2010 with the promise of economic growth. The result?  The unemployment rate rose in 2011, and GDP contracted for the past two quarters, meaning that the nation is now back in a recession. In contrast, last week we learned that Japan's economy grew by an annualized rate of 4.1% in the first quarter this year. Was Japan's growth spurt caused by cutting government spending as Romney wants? Nope. Quite the opposite. The Japanese government increased expenditures. While the government spending did increase the deficit, it sparked much-needed economic growth. If either candidate is going to make super promises about revitalizing the economy, he'll have to prove his ideas have worked in the past. And if he can't do that, he should at least be brutally honest and tell us there are no easy answers. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Dean Obeidallah .","Dean Obeidallah: America's economy in trouble, needs an ""Avenger"" superhero .

"(CNN) -- Some travelers sleepily making their way through airport security in Atlanta Sunday morning got a startling wake-up. A gun detected in a carry-on at a checkpoint at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport was accidentally fired by an investigating officer around 9 a.m. Sunday, according to a police report. Transportation Security Administration screeners reported the gun to Atlanta police officer N.J. Phillips, the officer wrote in an Atlanta Police Department report. The gun's owner was telling Phillips how to clear the loaded .22 Magnum revolver when it was accidentally discharged, Phillips reported. ""The weapon was pointed down towards the screening table."" ""I was grazed by a pellet fragment on the left side of my face,"" Phillips wrote. ""However, there were no visible injuries."" The gun was loaded with ""snake shot,"" ammunition usually used to hunt small animals. The gun's owner, Richard Popkin of Kathleen, Georgia, told Phillips he didn't realize the gun was still in his bag, according to the police report. Popkin said he originally intended to pack the bag in his checked luggage, but he removed it because he was concerned about the weight limit for his checked bag, according to the report. Popkin was arrested and charged with carrying a deadly weapon at a public gathering, according to the police report. The TSA followed standard procedure in alerting local law enforcement, the agency said in a statement. ""TSA also has opened an investigation and has the authority to level a civil penalty when a firearm is brought to a checkpoint."" TSA officers have discovered more than 1,100 firearms at checkpoints this year, the agency said. Firearms are not allowed in carry-on bags or at security checkpoints.","Gun found in carry-on accidentally discharged, police report says .

"BEIJING, China (CNN)  -- Four members of a Christian group from the United States are refusing to leave an airport in China after authorities confiscated their 300 Bibles, the group's director said Monday. Members of a Christian group say they will not leave China until their Bibles are returned. The four members of Vision Beyond Borders -- based in Sheridan, Wyoming -- arrived in the southwestern Chinese city of Kunming on Sunday. Customs officials discovered the Bibles during an X-ray scan of their luggage, said Pat Klein, director of the group, which supplies Bibles and other Christian material to people in China and other countries. Under Chinese law, it is illegal to bring printed religious material into the country if it exceeds the amount for personal use. The group distributes the Bibles through a local shop owner in Kunming, according to Klein. Klein said he's been bringing Bibles into China for 21 years and had no idea he was breaking Chinese law. The group spent the night at the airport, and Chinese customs officials told them they had broken the law and repeatedly asked them to leave the airport, Klein said. He said the customs agents have not been antagonistic. China says Christians are free to worship in China -- as long as they worship in a church that registers with the government. People in China can buy Bibles, but some members of underground or unregistered churches in China say Bibles are in short supply in some locations, especially rural areas, according to a 2007 report from the U.S. State Department. The Report on International Religious Freedom warned that the distribution of religious publications in China is closely watched. All publication in China is controlled by the government, whether religious or otherwise. ""Customs officials continued to monitor for the 'smuggling' of Bibles and other religious material into the country,"" the report said. ""Religious texts published without authorization, including Bibles and Qurans, may be confiscated."" President Bush criticized China's record on human rights and religious freedom in a speech he made before going to China for the opening ceremony of the Summer Olympics. ""I have spoken clearly, candidly and consistently with China's leaders about our deep concerns over religious freedom and human rights,"" he said. ""And I have met repeatedly with Chinese dissidents and religious believers. The United States believes the people of China deserve the fundamental liberty that is the natural right of all human beings."" Qin Gang, a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, brushed aside Bush's criticism. ""We firmly oppose any statements or deeds which use human rights, religion and other issues to interfere with the internal affairs of other countries,"" he said. He said China ""keeps to the concept of putting people's interest first and is devoted to maintaining and promoting basic rights and freedom of its citizens. ""Chinese citizens enjoy freedom of religion in accordance with the law."" While in China, Bush worshipped at a church that operates with government permission. That drew criticism from Amnesty International and other advocates of religious freedom, who said that Bush was endorsing the Chinese government's regulation of churches. Klein, meanwhile, said his group members won't leave until their Bibles are returned. ""We're being inconvenienced a little, but it's nothing compared to what our brothers and sisters in China experience for their faith in Jesus Christ,"" Klein said. They are scheduled to travel to Bangkok, Thailand, on Wednesday. CNN's Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","300 Bibles found during an X-ray scan of group's luggage .

"Chardon, Ohio (CNN) -- Prosecutor David Joyce said Tuesday that 17-year-old T.J. Lane has admitted taking a .22-caliber gun and a knife into Chardon High School on Monday morning and firing 10 rounds, choosing his victims randomly. Asked by Judge Timothy J. Grendell during a preliminary hearing if he understood his rights, Lane said softly, ""Yes, sir, yes, I do."" Lane will continue to be held in detention, and charges must be filed by 4:45 p.m. March 1, the judge ordered. Joyce predicted Lane will be tried as an adult. ""Absolutely,"" he said. ""It's a matter of law in the state of Ohio. At 17 years old, committing an act like this."" He predicted the high school sophomore will be charged with three counts of aggravated murder ""as well as other counts."" ""I guarantee that this was an aberration, this does not represent our community,"" Joyce told reporters. ""He chose his victims at random. This is not about bullying. This is not about drugs. This is someone who is not well and I'm sure, in our court case, we will prove that to all of your desires and we will make sure that justice is done in our county."" Grendell said the court had tentatively scheduled a hearing for March 19 ""should there be a filing of a motion for transfer to the adult court."" Earlier Tuesday, a third student died of wounds suffered in the shooting, hospital officials said. Demetrius Hewlin died Tuesday morning, MetroHealth Medical Center said in a statement. Russell King Jr., 17, was declared brain dead early Tuesday, according to the Cuyahoga County medical examiner's office. Student Daniel Parmertor died Monday. ""We are very saddened by the loss of our son and others in our Chardon community,"" Hewlin's family said in a statement released by the hospital. ""Demetrius was a happy young man who loved life and his family and friends. We will miss him very much, but we are proud that he will be able to help others through organ donation."" Police Chief Tim McKenna said the motive remained unclear. Students have described Lane as a withdrawn boy. Lane told authorities that he stole the gun used in the shootings from his uncle, a source told CNN on Tuesday. A law enforcement source said the weapon had been purchased legally. Police found the gun inside the school, apparently dropped by the suspect as he fled, the source said. One other student wounded in the shooting remained hospitalized Tuesday. A fifth victim was released, officials said. Geauga County Sheriff Daniel McClelland said the community has a long way to go before it can put the shooting behind it. ""Now we move to another important phase,"" he said. ""And while the investigation continues and we still look for the why and what and who, we now deal with a community looking to heal."" A prayer service at the Church of St. Mary in Chardon sought to speed that healing. Hundreds of people spilled outside the front of the church. Inside, those assembled applauded as school and police officials were introduced. ""These are great people and out of a very, very, very terrible tragedy, they'll rise again and they'll make this an even greater town,"" Gov. John Kasich told reporters outside the church. Heather Weinrich, a 2004 graduate of the school, said she drove an hour with her elementary school-age son to attend the event because she wanted him to know what happened and she wanted to support her school. Zack Barry, an 18-year-old senior at the school, said he was overwhelmed by the turnout of support. ""It made me feel very good,"" he said. Classes in the tightly knit community of 5,100, about 30 miles east of Cleveland near Lake Erie, are to resume Friday. But staff, students and parents will be encouraged to return to district schools for visits and counseling on Wednesday and Thursday, Superintendent Joe Bergant said. iReport: Shooting at Chardon High School . Some of the victims were students who were in the cafeteria waiting for a bus to take them to Auburn Career Center, a nearby vocational school that they attended, said Maggie Lynch, the school's superintendent. Lane is a student at Lake Academy Alternative School, a school for at-risk children, said the school's interim director, Don Ehas. In a statement Monday, Parmertor's family said they were ""torn by the loss."" ""Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him,"" the family said. Lawyer Bob Farinacci, speaking for Lane's family, said Monday night that the suspect was ""extremely remorseful."" ""Very, very scared and extremely remorseful,"" he told CNN affiliate WKYC. ""He is a very confused young man right now,"" Farinacci said. ""He's very confused. He is very upset. He's very distraught."" Like others in Chardon, Lane's family also has been left groping for an explanation. ""This is something that could never have been predicted,"" Farinacci said. ""T.J.'s family has asked for some privacy while they try to understand how such a tragedy could have occurred and while they mourn this terrible loss for their community."" With little to go on to help make sense of the violence, many turned to cryptic Facebook postings by the alleged shooter for a glimpse into Lane's mindset -- especially a long, dark poetic rant from December 30. The post refers to ""a quaint lonely town, (where there) sits a man with a frown (who) longed for only one thing, the world to bow at his feet."" ""He was better than the rest, all those ones he detests, within their castles, so vain,"" he wrote. Lane then wrote about going through ""the castle ... like an ominous breeze through the trees,"" past guards -- all leading up to the post's dramatic conclusion. ""Feel death, not just mocking you. Not just stalking you but inside of you,"" it says. ""Wriggle and writhe. Feel smaller beneath my might. Seizure in the Pestilence that is my scythe."" The post concludes with: ""Die, all of you."" Farinacci said Lane was a ""fairly quiet and good kid"" with good grades who was doubling up on classes to graduate in May. ""He pretty much sticks to himself but does have some friends and has never been in trouble over anything that we know about,"" he said. But just before class started Monday, witnesses say, Lane silently walked up to a table of students, holding a gun. As he opened fire, the shooter was expressionless, a student recalled. ""He was silent the entire time,"" said student Nate Mueller, who said his ear was grazed by a bullet. ""There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire."" Monday's death toll might have been higher had it not been for the actions of assistant football coach and study hall teacher Frank Hall. Students said Hall chased the gunman out of the school, and police arrested the suspect nearby a short time later. ""Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone,"" said student Neil Thomas. ""And I think today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us. He would take a bullet for us."" Similar praise was given to math teacher Joseph Ricci, whom 10th-grader Kaylee O'Donnell said made sure his students were safe before donning a bulletproof vest and entering a hallway, where he pulled a wounded student inside. ""You're pretty brave in risking your life for students,"" she said. ""I actually was sitting with a girl, and she asked if we could pray and I'm like 'Yes, please.' So me and her quietly did that and a couple of my friends."" Asked how she would feel when she returns to school, she said, ""It's not going to be the same, but I still feel safe."" The shooting has had national repercussions. ""Violence like this should not be tolerated in our society,"" said House Speaker John Boehner.

"(CNN) -- ""Hippie,"" says Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros frontman Alex Ebert. ""It's largely a pejorative sort of term."" That may sound odd coming from the hirsute leader of a 12-piece collective that has a history of traveling in a renovated school bus. But while Ebert and accordionist-vocalist Nora Kirkpatrick seem slightly perturbed by the choice of words, Ebert's response indicates he doesn't feel too slighted. ""When one says 'hippie,' and then they reference things like 'communal' and all of those sort of bands from a very hopeful era, actually, where everything felt like it was on the precipice of something sort of infinite, and possible, I think that, in that sense, the word 'hippie' would apply."" Ebert says. These are hopeful days where anything is possible for the band. The Zeros' second album ""Here,"" hit No.5 on the Billboard 200 chart, and peaked atop Billboard's Independent and Folk album charts. Besides one gig in August, the band is taking a break from touring until September 6. But people who want to see what it's like on the road with the Zeros can check out the new DVD ""Big Easy Express,"" which documents their April 2011 tour from Oakland, California, to New Orleans by vintage train, along with Old Crow Medicine Show and Mumford & Sons. Ebert says that from the band's beginning, he told its manager he'd like to perform at unconventional venues. ""Where I was at, at the time, was just a feeling of having really done the sort of cookie cutter sort of thing, and wanting to just completely abandon that for parking lots and parks and communal areas, and make the experience sort of loose, and sort of a free-for-all of joy,"" Ebert says. ""I think when you do things that are just slightly out of the norm, it not only affects your experience of what just happened -- of the event -- but affects the way you view the possibilities of your own actions going forward in your life."" ""Like, to me, the railroad tour that we did with Old Crow and with Mumford and Sons was a culmination of all of the sort of childhood sort of ideals of being with a crew -- with a band of sort of brothers and sisters, and all playing music together, on a train going who knows where."" That freewheeling feeling permeates the band's music, and its mythology. Ebert and Kirkpatrick expressed that while telling stories about how the band formed. ""I met Alex and Jade at Burning Man, which is a really exciting festival up in the desert,"" Kirkpatrick says, with Ebert adding, ""It sounds scripted. It sounds so exactly what people would expect"" ""I know. I know,"" Kirkpatrick says. ""Which is kind of ridiculous at this point. But, I was good friends with Jade's cousin and kind of introduced through friends and I don't know, then music ensued. And that was like five years ago, I guess."" ""Literally, it sounds like an indie movie,"" Ebert adds. According to the pair, the band's name evolved in a somewhat random way. While some writers have described ""Edward Sharpe"" as Ebert's alter ego, the singer says that's a false belief. ""It was just a story I was writing where the character was Edward Sharpe,"" he says. ""And around the same time, I came up with a form of mathematics that has no known application, called Magnetic Zeros. And then I started a MySpace page called Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros."" ""It sort of got lost in translation. There's sort of no character that I'm playing or an alter ego really, but more something that I think that I'm reaching towards within myself maybe, or that we all are."" With a dozen band members, it could be difficult find a role for everyone. But Kirkpatrick says that diversity strengthens the band. ""Some people are trained jazz musicians, and some people went to -- trained in Africa, you know, for drumming and rhythm, and some of us kind of taught ourselves what we know, or picked up pieces here along the way,"" she says. ""So, I think when we all come together, it offers not just one school of thought, or one approach to playing or learning music, but everyone kind of throws in a different color into the pot."" Ebert, who says he's spiritual, while ""not so fond of"" religious order and dogma, says ultimately, the music creates itself. ""The song tends to tell you exactly what it wants. You know what I mean? And you just kind of have to listen to that,"" he says. ""So, if it wants a single voice in a section, it seems to be pretty obvious. If it wants a bunch of voices, then it seems to be pretty obvious. It's a fun, sort of delicate process of listening for what the song wants.""","The Zeros' second album ""Here,"" hit No.5 on the Billboard 200 chart .

"(CNN) -- BP appealed Friday for a halt to settlements to those affected by the massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill, because of what it says are ""hundreds of millions of dollars, and what could reach billions of dollars, in awards to claims asserting fictitious losses."" ""Any such payment will constitute irreparable harm,"" the energy giant argued. ""Therefore, an expedited hearing is necessary."" Such a hearing is now scheduled for March 22, after the court granted BP's emergency motion. The legal debate is part of the widespread fallout from the oil spill -- the worst in U.S. history -- which began after a rig explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon in the Gulf. Eleven workers died. Roughly 205 million gallons of oil spewed into the sea for nearly three months before a cap was placed on the BP-owned Macondo well, nearly a mile beneath the surface. Since then, the oil company has promised and paid out some settlement funds, while fighting others in court. Earlier this year, U.S. District Judge Carl Barbier Jr. considered BP's contention that a January 15 decision by the claims administrator about how settlements would be distributed. BP had argued that the set-up would produce ""absurd"" results. And yet Barbier sided against BP in a March 5 decision. ""The court adopts Class Counsel's interpretation as it is most in line with the rest of the settlement agreement,"" the judge wrote.","BP has been a target since the massive 2010 Gulf of Mexico oil spill .

"(CNN) -- The story so far: Northwest teen Bella Swan falls in love with Edward Cullen, a mysteriously aloof, fair-skinned but exceedingly well-educated young man who confesses to being a ""vegetarian"" vampire. This bums out Bella's best friend, Jacob, who has always carried a torch for her, and who has a natural aversion to vampires, being a werewolf himself. Despite his better (and worse) instincts, Edward is smitten, and eventually he agrees to marry her. At the end of ""Breaking Dawn - Part 1"" she gives birth to their half-human child, but nearly dies during labor. In order to save Bella's life, Edward has to ""turn"" his bride into an immortal -- which is what she wanted all along. Still with us? ""Breaking Dawn - Part 2,"" the fifth and final film in ""The Twilight Saga"" begins with Bella waking up to enjoy her freshly sharpened senses, her attractive red eyes and vampiric super-strength. And the first, most pressing question on everybody's mind is this: Will she eat the baby? Edward whisks her off into the woods to quench her thirst, where the question becomes: will Bella eat Bambi? And then a third time: will she eat the anonymous climber scaling a sheer rock face oblivious to the real danger he is in? Teen movies have sure come a long way since ""The Breakfast Club."" Back then, all we wanted was to find common ground and fit in. Mind you, once her sanguinary and carnal appetites have been satisfied, assimilation is also Bella's main concern. Life after 'Twilight': Readers pick new teams . It exhibits along the lines of: what to tell dad? And what to do about the wolfboy who has marked out her newborn -- but fast-growing -- daughter as his intended? (""You nicknamed my baby after the Loch Ness monster?!"") It has taken this series a long time to line up its dominoes, but ""Breaking Dawn -- Part 2"" is easily the freakiest film in the saga, and the most fun. Before we're done there will be a virtual United Nations of vampire delegates -- associates from the North, from Amazonia, the Middle East, from Ireland and, yes, Transylvania, converging on Forks and getting a chance to bond with baby Cullen before the ultimate showdown with their eminences, the Volturi. These cloaked archvillains have been waiting in the wings so long it's a wonder they haven't taken off, but at last Michael Sheen's got the chance to act -- show these young pretenders how it's done -- and he doesn't waste a single voluptuous syllable. In one extraordinary moment he lets rip with what can only be described as a squeal. It's a performance Christopher Walken would love, and Nic Cage could only envy -- there can be no higher praise. Share your review of 'Breaking Dawn Part 2' The battle, when it comes, is exciting and almost ludicrously grisly. Heads duly roll. Even Twi-haters (maybe especially Twi-haters) will enjoy the kind of carnage normally associated with the worst excesses of the French Revolution. Directed, like the last film, by Bill Condon, and not at all ashamed of wearing its big pulpy heart on its sleeve, ""BDP2"" is enjoyably demented, a rousing curtain call and quite enough to tide us over until Stephenie Meyer's ""The Host"" reaches our screens next March.","""Breaking Dawn --- Part 2"" is the fifth and final Twilight film .

"New Delhi (CNN) -- A local Indian official resigned Monday after a chaotic crush at a railroad station a day earlier left 36 people dead among tens of millions of Hindu pilgrims flocking to the banks of the Ganges River for the world's largest religious gathering. The stampede occurred on Sunday evening as floods of pilgrims entering the station in Allahabad, the scene of this year's Kumbh Mela festival, broke through temporary barriers and crowded onto already busy platforms, railway authorities said. In addition to the 36 killed in the ensuing crush, more than 30 people were injured, according to North-Central Railway, which operates the station. Local television footage showed bodies, many of them covered in white sheets, lying on the floor in the railway station, with wailing relatives sitting nearby. Luggage, shoes, slippers and other belongings also lay strewn across the ground. Shreya Dhoundial, a reporter for CNN affiliate IBN in Allahabad, said that almost four hours after the stampede occurred, dead bodies remained on the station platform and injured people were still crying for help. ""If the media could get in, if police officials could get in, if railway officials could get in, why couldn't the doctors, why couldn't the ambulances?"" she said. Worried families . Relatives of many of the people injured in the chaos gathered at a hospital in the city on Monday, waiting for news on their loved ones, Dhoundial said. Azam Khan, the local official in charge of security for the huge Hindu festival, resigned Monday, IBN reported. Khan, who is also the minister for urban development in Uttar Pradesh, the state where Allahabad is situated, said he was taking responsibility for the fatal disaster. Amid confusion about what exactly had set off the panic, the Uttar Pradesh government ordered an inquiry into a the stampede, IBN said. Some eye witnesses blamed police for the crush, saying they had charged at the heaving crowds in the station. Authorities, however, denied police used force to try to control the mass of people. At one point on Sunday, Sandeep Mathur, a spokesman for North-Central Railway, suggested that the mayhem had been prompted by a person falling from a platform bridge. But on Monday, Railway Minister P.K. Bansal said straightforward overcrowding was the cause. ""There was a lot of chaos,"" he said, adding that the station remained very crowded Monday. Authorities said they would give 500,000 rupees ($9,300) compensation to the families of victims and 100,000 rupees to those who were injured. Tens of millions of pilgrims . An estimated 40 million people came to Allahabad, in the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, on Sunday to bathe at the confluence of the Yamuna and Ganges rivers and the mythical Saraswati River. It's the most significant Hindu pilgrimage, occurring every 12 years, Indian cultural and political observer K.G. Suresh said. ""The Hindus believe that a dip in the confluence of the Ganges, Yamuna and the Saraswati on this occasion helps get rid of all worldly sins,"" Suresh said. Sunday was the main day for bathing of the 55-day Kumbh Mela. In Hindu mythology, Allahabad is one of the four places where drops of the ""nectar of immortality"" contained in a pitcher fell to earth as gods and demons fought for it. The holy bathing began on Saturday afternoon and peaked after midnight, festival official Satish Kumar Sharma said. More than 12,000 police officers were guarding the nearly 20-square-kilometer (7.7-square-mile) site, India's government said. Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh said he was ""deeply shocked"" by the deaths and promised to extend ""all possible help"" to state authorities. ""I send my heartfelt condolences to the members of the bereaved families and wish those injured a speedy recovery,"" Singh said in a statement issued by his office. He pledged that those injured and the families of those killed would receive compensation.

"(CNN) -- Computer networks can't feel or understand jokes, but software engineers have hardwired some compassion. Mechanisms in place in Facebook's system and in Google's search engine can look for suicidal messages and direct people to help. Facebook is encouraging its 800 million users to use a system the company created to flag suicidal or otherwise violent messages. If someone is posting unsettling photos or writing status updates about killing himself or herself, friends can click on a ""report suicidal content"" link. At Facebook, staff members are monitoring these reports at all times of the day, a spokesman told CNN in June. Facebook investigates each report and may send a suicidal person an e-mail offering phone numbers for suicide hot lines, he said. That feature has been around since at least the summer, but Facebook said in a statement on Tuesday that it is expanding a partnership with the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, which is funded by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. In addition to phone support, the lifeline will now let Facebook users communicate with suicide prevention specialists in a Web chat room, the statement said. The national suicide hot line and Facebook have been partnering since 2006, lifeline project director John Draper said in a statement. Google added a feature to its U.S. search engine in April 2010 that displays a picture of a red telephone and the phone number for the lifeline when people are searching for suicide-related topics. Earlier, the company launched a similar feature for a poison-control hot line after receiving an e-mail from a mother who had trouble finding the number when her daughter ingested something poisonous, a Google spokeswoman said. ""In times of crisis, it's important to try to help people by quickly providing information,"" the spokeswoman wrote in an e-mail. ""It's a privilege for Google to be working with the NSPL and to be providing support on this important issue.""","Facebook and Google have new mechanisms for helping suicidal people .

"Washington (CNN) -- The State of the Union address is held in the U.S. House chamber, where lawmakers, Cabinet officials and Supreme Court justices crowd the floor. Dignitaries and other invited guests pack the balcony. Still more stand along the back and down the aisles. The hall is smaller than imagined. The din ahead of the annual event is broken when the main doors to the ornate room swing open and the sergeant at arms booms: ""Mr. Speaker, the President of the United States."" Dating to George Washington, there are few ceremonial moments like it in Washington, and the historic moment has never been lost on Hollywood. The address -- or the floor of Congress -- has been a character, title or storyline in several films and TV shows over the years. Remember the final scene in the movie Dave? Or the opening of Episode 13, Season Two of ""The West Wing?"" But you won't find the actual State of the Union address in the 1948 Frank Capra movie called, well, ""State of the Union."" Some appearances of the State of the Union addresses or dramatic speeches before Congress include: . ""State of the Union"" (1948) One would think that a movie named ""State of the Union"" would include an actual State of the Union address. Nope. Maybe director Frank Capra was our nation's first ironic hipster. Either way, the film does deal with the politics of running for president and Spencer Tracy apologizes to the woman he loves and to the American people through a radio address. ""Dave"" (1993) In the 1993 film, the President of the United States falls into a coma after an embarrassing incident. So White House insiders scramble to look for someone who looks like him and keep up the charade. They find Dave. Played by Kevin Kline, Dave is an average Joe -- honest and kind -- who wants to actually help people. But the political powers want him gone and accuse him of corruption. In the key scene, Dave faces a joint session of Congress and the American people to address the accusations. After that speech, he's not the president anymore. Life's tough. ""The American President"" (1995) While many would've thought the climatic speech in this Rob Reiner-directed film featured Michael Douglas as president speaking before the joint session of Congress, the most dramatic and most quotable part of the movie was when Douglas, as president Andrew Shepard, spoke to a packed White House briefing room. Douglas defends his relationship with Annette Bening's character and in the process, talked about gun control and climate control. ""The West Wing"" -- Season 2, Episode 13 (1999) Played by Martin Sheen, Josiah Bartlet was the ideal president. His speeches were both passionate and pragmatic. In the episode ""Bartlet's Third State of the Union,"" he speaks before the American people while dealing with a hostage situation in South America. The entire episode was built around the speech. Political jargon? Check. Melodramatic walk-and-talks? Check. An Aaron Sorkin-induced speechwriting masterpiece? Well, almost. ""The Contender"" (2000) Jeff Bridges plays a shrewd President Jackson Evans and in the pivotal speech of this 2000 drama, he goes before Congress during the State of the Union address to speak out against sexism, challenging them to confirm the first female vice president. It's a moving speech near the end of the movie, and you'd be surprised how it turned out. ""Head of State"" (2003) Sure, many of us would love Chris Rock as our president. In the 2003 comedy ""Head of State,"" Rock runs for president and as expected, strikes a chord with the American people before hitting a few speed-bumps along the way. In the big scene, his character, D.C. alderman Mays Gilliam stops arguing with his opponent and instead speaks directly to the American people, touching on issues of foreign policy, crime, and even the pseudo-imperialism of American exceptionalism. But alas, while the setting looks like the chambers of Congress and the State of the Union, it's not. ""XXX: State of the Union"" (2005) This 2005 movie starring rapper Ice Cube is chock-filled with loud guns, loud hip-hop and really bad acting. But the actual State of the Union address does show up in this film, although it's where terrorists kidnap the president. ""Commander-in-Chief"" -- Season 1, Episode 1 (2005) We have had the first Catholic president, the first African-American president and, yet, we still haven't had the first woman president. On the small screen, Geena Davis played the part as President MacKenzie Allen in 2005. In the opening episode of this ABC drama, the first woman president goes before Congress and talks of hope and aspirations and of American being a force for good across the globe. ""State of the Union"" (2008) Another head-fake. Despite the title, there is no actual State of the Union here, either. Just a series of sketches performed by the experienced comedian Tracey Ullman, where she skewers American culture. Watching this 2008 comedy series on Showtime, though, was probably more fun than watching an actual State of the Union. ""W"" (2008) Of all the movies on the list, this one clearly feels the most surreal. An Oliver Stone creation, it's hard to judge whether the movie is actually a biography of George W. Bush as young collegian and as president. Josh Brolin does a fine job of portraying the 43rd president. In the film, Brolin convinces the country to go to war with Iraq. Interestingly, the speech that Brolin gives in the movie is an actual speech given by Bush while persuading the country to go to war, with the song . ""What a Wonderful World"" in the background and actual footage of real audience reaction weaved into the movie.","Several movies and TV shows have featured the State of the Union address .
Others have used the title, but the annual address never makes an appearance ."
"(CNN) -- The secret election to pick a new pope has yet to begin. But whoever is picked may already be mulling over his choice of name -- and what it means. In the long history of popes, stretching back two millennia to St. Peter, some names have picked up negative associations, while others have come to signify conservatism or a desire for change. So what the new pontiff chooses may be one of the first clues to the course he intends to steer for the world's 1.2 billion Roman Catholics. For example, Pius XII, who served from 1939 to 1958, was very conservative, said eminent Italian church historian Alberto Melloni. ""If the new pope was to call himself Pius XIII, it would be a very ideological choice,"" he said. On the other side of the coin, a new pope that named himself John XXIV would be signaling an openness to reform. John XXIII was famed for calling the Second Vatican Council in 1962, which ushered in great changes in the Roman Catholic Church's relationship with the modern world. He was brave to pick the name John at all, says Melloni, since the last man to hold the name is viewed as an ""antipope"" because he was elected pontiff during a schism in the church in the 15th Century. John XXIII got away with it because he said it was in deference to his parish saint, John the Baptist, Melloni said. Benedict XVI, who gets to keep his name in rather than reverting to Joseph Ratzinger in his unprecedented position as pope emeritus, meant his choice to be unifying. In his first general audience after taking office in 2005, he told the crowds gathered in St. Peter's Square that he wished to follow in the steps of Benedict XV, who led the church through the turbulent years of the First World War. ""He was a true and courageous prophet of peace who struggled strenuously and bravely, first to avoid the drama of war and then to limit its terrible consequences,"" Benedict XVI said. ""In his footsteps I place my ministry, in the service of reconciliation and harmony between peoples."" The choice also evoked St. Benedict, founder of the Benedictine order of monks, who helped spread Christianity throughout Europe and was particularly venerated in Ratzinger's homeland, Germany. For the early popes, the choice of a name wasn't an issue. It wasn't until the end of the 10th Century that the head of the church started taking a different name to the one he was born with, said Melloni. But since then only one, Adrian VI in the 16th Century, has kept his baptismal name. Some were monks from countries other than Italy who wanted to create a link through their names to the great saints of Rome. This was the start of the long list of popes named Leo, Gregory and Benedict, said Melloni. In fact, he added, the practice can be seen as typical of a dynasty without sons and daughters -- creating a sense of succession and a link to the earliest names in the church. In the 20th Century, John Paul I was the first to create a composite name, in tribute to the two popes who had led the church through the Second Vatican Council, which closed under Paul VI following John XXIII's death. He died barely more than a month later, putting him among the shortest-lived of popes. John Paul II, born Karol Wojtyla in Poland -- making him the first non-Italian pope since the 16th Century -- in turn wanted to show homage to that brief pontificate through carrying on the name, said Melloni. As the 115 cardinal-electors prepare to meet in the conclave, for the secret election to pick a new pope almost certainly from within their number, the sense of intrigue will only grow. ""What you may find in the next few days will be the tendency not to try to guess who will be elected and and what name he will take, but to try to define the kind of pope they may hope for,"" said Melloni. ""There is a very conservative party within the cardinals who are hoping for Pius XIII or Benedict XVII,"" he said. Others look to someone like Archbishop Luis Antonio Tagle, of Manila, as a possible John Paul III, he said, while some of the Italians who want to see the papacy returned to one of their number talk about Paul VII. In any case, any cardinal who's in with a shot of the papacy would do well to do his homework. Whoever first gains the two-thirds plus one share of the vote and is named pope won't have long to think about it. Once all the votes are counted, the dean of the College of Cardinals will ask the newly elected head of the church on the spot if he accepts the role and what he wants to be called. While we wait to hear, we can be sure of only one thing, according to Melloni: the new pope won't be called Peter. This is out of respect for the first St. Peter, the Apostle -- but perhaps also reflects a centuries' old prophecy that a Peter II will be the very last pope to serve. CNN's Hada Messia contributed to this report.","The name chosen by the new pope could signal his outlook for the papacy .
Past names can carry a message of conservatism or openness to reform .
Benedict XVI meant his choice of name to be unifying .
No pope is likely to pick Peter -- in part because of a centuries' old prophecy ."
"(CNN) -- For years, Republican presidents and presidential candidates have strip-mined Clint Eastwood movies for rhetorical nuggets. Ronald Reagan warned Congress in 1985 that he had his veto pen at the ready if it voted a tax increase. ""Go ahead, make my day,"" he baited, quoting Eastwood's Dirty Harry character in ""Sudden Impact."" ""Read my lips,"" promised candidate George H.W. Bush in 1988, echoing Eastwood in the original ""Dirty Harry,"" adding, ""No new taxes."" Thursday night, Mitt Romney's campaign recruited Eastwood himself. The beloved actor/director, 82, was the ""mystery guest"" at the Republican Convention, a warm-up act for Sen. Mario Rubio of Florida, who introduced candidate Romney. He strode out on the stage, hair uncombed and a little wild, with his familiar, stiff-legged authority, and proceeded to deliver an improvised piece of performance art that triggered unintentional amusement and confusion within the Tampa Bay Times Forum and throughout the viewing audience. But to many, the political nuggets Eastwood delivered this time were more like fool's gold. ""I never thought it was a good idea for attorneys to be president anyhow,"" Eastwood rambled, perhaps unaware that Romney has a law degree, ""because they're arguing both sides of the issue."" News: Eastwood, the empty chair, and the speech everyone's talking about . ""Clint Eastwood became huge star as a man of few words. As a surprise guest on the Tampa stage he had too many words (I say as a friend),"" tweeted newsman Tom Brokaw of the actor's apparently improvised act, where he addressed an empty chair meant to represent President Barack Obama. Afterward, the Chicago Sun-Times critic and Obama supporter Roger Ebert tweeted, ""Clint, my hero, is coming across as sad and pathetic. He didn't need to do this to himself. It's unworthy of him."" For this film critic and longtime admirer of Eastwood (and a registered Democrat), it was not the best hour for the former mayor of Carmel, California. But was I surprised that Eastwood, a man who describes himself as an ""Eisenhower Republican"" and who publicly endorsed John McCain in 2008, would appear at the Republican convention? Not at all. Eastwood is nothing if not a straight shooter. What did surprise me, a little, is that the GOP would invite Eastwood after prominent Republicans such as Karl Rove criticized the actor as an Obama tool for narrating Chrysler's ""Halftime in America"" ad aired at the Super Bowl this year. What also surprised me is that the GOP would invite the guy who told GQ magazine in October, ""These people who are making a big deal about gay marriage? I don't give a --- about who wants to get married to anybody else. Why not?"" And it was surprising that, when the identity of the ""mystery guest"" was revealed Thursday evening, many non-Republicans took to Twitter and Facebook to pillory Eastwood, huffing that his appearance at the GOP convention ""tainted"" his movies for them. Huh? First of all, Eastwood publicly endorsed Romney this month. Second of all, the actor who is a lower-case-L libertarian on social issues (pro-gay marriage, pro choice, pro-ecology) and a fiscal conservative is hardly one to toe a party line. Have they watched Eastwood's movies? You can't pin this guy down ideologically. Many have tried. All have failed. As critic Dave Kehr has noted, ""Ambivalence runs deep in his movies, just as it runs through American culture."" Eastwood specializes in playing men in the moral shadowlands. During the Nixon years liberals branded Eastwood movies like ""Dirty Harry"" as ""fascist."" During the Clinton years, conservatives tagged ""Unforgiven"" as squishy ""political correctness."" Heaven knows what they made of -- SPOILER ALERT! -- the assisted suicide in his other Oscar-winning movie, ""Million Dollar Baby."" Entertainment: Stars react to Clint Eastwood . The first half of Eastwood's career he played men who shot first and thought about it later. The second half of his career, he's largely devoted himself to exploring the consequences of that gunplay. Is that Republican? Is that Democrat? I think it's American. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Carrie Rickey.","Carrie Rickey: Clint Eastwood lines have long been used by politicians, mainly from right .

"Seoul (CNN) -- As the snow falls and the wind bites on a stark winter's day in Seoul, a lady rugged up in a green woolen overcoat and scarf arrives at a church nestled among shops and office buildings. Kim Ha-young comes in from the cold and greets me with a warm and gentle smile. She shakes my hand - her gold wedding band still on display. It's not her real name but she can't afford to reveal her true identity: She believes that would place her family in serious danger and she's lost far too much already. It's almost two years since she found her husband, Kim Chang-hwan, foaming at the mouth in the Chinese city of Dandong on the North Korean border. The 46-year-old father of two had been working as a missionary, helping North Korean defectors escape across the border. Kim Ha-young was living in the border city as well, helping her husband. She had just spoken to her husband 15 minutes earlier. ""He told me he was meeting a North Korean defector and would then come home. A short time later I got a call from one of his colleagues who said (my husband) collapsed on the street and he told me to rush to the hospital,"" she said. ""When I got there he was dead."" Hospital officials said Kim Chang-hwan had committed suicide by swallowing pesticides. His wife believes he was killed by a North Korean agent. ""My husband was aware of the risk. People around us were telling us that it is a dangerous job because North Korean government will severely deal with people who helped North Koreans defect,"" she said. Defectors describe horror, heartbreak in North Korea's labor camps . ""But I did not think that my husband would never come back. We never expected that it would cost a life. We thought maybe the risk was prison or being expelled from the country by Chinese government. We never thought that it would cost his life."" Refusing to accept the hospital's explanation for her husband's death, Kim Ha-young demanded the Chinese government conduct an autopsy. The autopsy report came back saying there was no poison in his system. Fearful of a cover-up, she went to the morgue before his body was cremated and collected samples of his blood on a glove and gave them to South Korean authorities on her return to Seoul. The government report on that blood sample, reviewed by CNN, revealed levels of poison high enough to kill a person instantly.

"Washington (CNN) -- After three weeks on the ground, Boeing's 787 Dreamliner soon will return to the skies -- but only so engineers can test the plane's troubled electrical and battery systems, the Federal Aviation Administration said Thursday. The FAA approved test flights for the Boeing planes with strict conditions to assure safety: Only essential personnel will be on board, crews must continuously monitor the plane for battery-related problems and tests will be conducted over unpopulated areas. ""These flights will be an important part of our efforts to ensure the safety of passengers and return these aircraft to service,"" the agency said. Boeing spokesman Marc Birtel said in a statement that the company is ""confident"" the tests could be conducted safely, and said one Boeing aircraft has been designated for the test. Flights are planned in the U.S. Northwest. Although there are only 50 Dreamliners in service worldwide, the stakes are high for the world's largest aircraft manufacturer. Following a difficult development, Boeing has several hundred 787s on order at roughly $200 million apiece. The Dreamliner is the first commercial aircraft to have extensive use of novel lithium-ion batteries, which can hold more electrical power in a smaller, lighter space. Dreamliner battery type requires safeguards, safety advocate says . The FAA announcement comes on the same day the National Transportation Safety Board told reporters it had identified the exact battery cell that first short-circuited on a plane in Boston in early January, but still had not determined the root cause of the electrical short. It listed among the possibilities a manufacturing flaw, a design defect or problems with external systems that charge and discharge the battery. The safety board also said it is placing under the microscope Boeing's testing program, which led to the certification of the lithium-ion batteries for the plane. Those tests apparently led the airplane builder to greatly underestimate the chances of battery failure, the safety board said. Boeing had estimated a ""smoke"" event would occur ""less than once in 10 million flight hours"" with the batteries, Deborah Hersman, the safety board's chairman, said. But two batteries failed after fewer than 100,000 hours of actual flight, one leading to a fire aboard the 787 on the ground in Boston. Further, Boeing's indications that heat damage in one battery cell would not harm adjacent cells proved false, Hersman said. ""The assumptions used to certify the battery must be reconsidered,"" Hersman said. Hersman's statements cast doubt on the safety of the battery technology and the FAA's certification process for approving technology. It also appeared to dispel any hopes for a quick resolution to the problem, which has led to the grounding of the Dreamliner fleet globally since Jan. 16. The safety board plans to release an interim report of its findings within 30 days. Japan's ANA replaced faulty batteries on Dreamliner last year . The FAA -- the ultimate arbiter of when the plane can resume flying -- has declined to predict when the 787 will return to commercial service. Speaking about the January 7 fire in Boston, Hersman said the plane's flight data recorder showed the battery underwent an unexplained drop in voltage from 32 volts to 28 immediately before the incident, as the plane was being serviced on the tarmac. The voltage drop was consistent with the charge of a single cell on the eight-cell battery, she said. Hersman said investigators believe the problem originated in cell six, which shows multiple signs of a short circuit -- an unintended path of electricity. The short circuit resulted in a thermal runaway -- a chemical chain reaction -- in cell six, which spread to adjacent cells. ""Charred battery components indicated that the temperature inside the battery case exceeded 500 degrees,"" Hersman said. But investigators still don't know what caused cell six to short-circuit in the first place. They have ruled out two possibilities -- mechanical ""impact"" damage, like that caused by being dropped, or short-circuiting outside the battery. But several other possibilities are being explored, including contamination or defect during manufacturing, flaws in the design or construction of the battery, and problems with battery charging. That final possibility -- battery charging -- leaves open the possibility that the problem could reside outside the battery itself. When the FAA approved the use of the lithium-ion batteries on the Dreamliner, it imposed nine ""special conditions"" that were designed to prevent or mitigate problems. In a joint statement on Thursday, Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and FAA Administrator Michael Huerta reiterated that they are determined to fix the problem. ""Based on what information our experts find, the FAA will take any action necessary to further ensure safety. We must finish this work before reaching conclusions about what changes or improvements the FAA should make going forward,"" the statement read. ""The FAA is focused on the review and activities to understand the root cause. Once the review is complete, the FAA will make any analysis and conclusions public."" Boeing said it has hundreds of experts focused on solving the battery situation. ""We are working this issue tirelessly in cooperation with our customers and the appropriate regulatory and investigative authorities."" What's wrong with the Dreamliner?

"Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- Just hours after the United States warned that North Korea would achieve nothing with threats or provocations, Pyongyang moved a long-range rocket it plans to test fire to a launch pad Monday, a South Korean Defense Ministry official said. A U.S. official said the United States also has seen signs the North Koreans are preparing to launch a long-range rocket. The news broke at the start of a two-day nuclear summit in Seoul that is bringing together leaders from the United States, Russia, China and dozens of other nations to discuss how to deal with nuclear terrorism and how to secure the world's nuclear material. Overshadowing the summit's message of international cooperation was an announcement by North Korea that it plans to carry out a rocket-powered satellite launch in mid-April. South Korea has said it considers the satellite launch an attempt to develop a nuclear-armed missile, while U.S. President Barack Obama said Monday such a launch would bring repercussions. ""Here in Korea, I want to speak directly to the leadership in Pyongyang. The United States has no hostile intent toward your country,"" Obama said during a speech to students at Seoul's Hankuk University of Foreign Studies. ""But by now it should be clear, your provocations and pursuit of nuclear weapons have not achieved the security you seek. They have undermined it."" South Korean President Lee Myung-bak said Monday his country would ""thoroughly retaliate against North Korea"" if provoked. If the rocket is launched, South Korea is prepared to ""track its trajectory,"" said the Defense Ministry official, who did not want to be named. ""There are concerns that parts of the rocket may fall within South Korean territory,"" he said. ""If that were to happen it would threaten lives and cause damage to the economy. To guard against that, they (the military) will be tracking the orbit."" The rocket was moved to a launch pad in the northeastern portion of Dongchang-ri, a village in northwest North Korea, the South Korean official said. North Korea says it has a right to a peaceful space program and has invited international space experts and journalists to witness the launch. Prior to Obama's speech, Pyongyang said it will see any statement critical of its nuclear program as ""a declaration of war."" Using ballistic missile technology is in violation of U.N. Security Council Resolution 1874 and against a deal North Korea struck with the United States earlier this month that, in return for food aid, it would not carry out nuclear or missile tests. ""There will be no rewards for provocations. Those days are over,"" Obama said in his speech. ""To the leaders of Pyongyang I say, this is the choice before you. This is the decision that you must make. Today we say, Pyongyang, have the courage to pursue peace and give a better life to the people of North Korea."" The U.N. nuclear watchdog agency's director general, Yukiya Amano, said the U.S.-North Korea deal is ""not over"" despite Pyongyang's plans to launch the rocket. ""We have established contact at a working level, and they are keeping contact with the North Korean mission in Vienna,"" Amano said. ""Nothing has been decided yet."" He said the International Atomic Energy Agency needs to consult with North Korea and other parties involved in the multilateral talks, known as the six-party talks. Obama's wide-ranging speech also touched on the U.S. commitment to further cut its stockpile of nuclear weapons, and he issued a stern warning to Iran. The president said sanctions have led to the ""slowing"" of Tehran's nuclear program. But it remains a concern. While the president didn't specify the course of action if Iran does not comply with international demands and produces nuclear weapons, he left little leeway for Tehran's leaders. ""Iran must act with the seriousness and sense of urgency that this moment demands. Iran must meet its obligations,"" Obama said. Later, Obama met with his Russian counterpart, Dmitry Medvedev, and the two agreed that there is a window of opportunity to pursue diplomacy and that Iran should take advantage of it, Ben Rhodes, one of Obama's deputy national security advisers, told reporters. The two leaders also agreed the proposed launch by North Korea would be a violation of U.N. Security Council resolutions, he said. ""There is agreement that provocative acts like this will only increase isolation going forward,"" Rhodes said. The rocket launch site is near the Chinese border. China has somewhat of a diplomatic relationship with North Korea, though the relationship between the two countries is limited because of Pyongyang's routine provocations. As a result, North Korea's planned launch was front and center in a meeting between Obama and China's president, Hu Jintao. ""The two leaders agreed to coordinate closely to this potential provocation, and registering our serious concerns,"" Rhodes said. The two also agreed there is a broad view in the international community that a satellite launch would be destabilizing, he said. Obama and Hu also discussed North Korea's new leadership, ""this being a sensitive time on the Korean peninsula, and this being a new leader who is going to take some lessons from what works and what doesn't,"" Rhodes said. North Korean leader Kim Jong Un took over from his father following the latter's death in December. ""That's a conversation President Obama had with both China and Russia,"" Rhodes said. ""... I think they also share a frustration with the choices the new leadership has made as well."" CNN's Paula Hancocks, Tim Schwartz, Becky Brittain, and Pam Benson contributed to this report.","NEW: South Korea says it will retaliate if provoked .

"(CNN) -- As a child, Lee Yoon Jung used to hide underground with her classmates when the sirens rang at her school. The emergency drills were held in case of a North Korean attack. Lee, now 46, has children of her own, who do not have such exercises at their schools in Ulsan, South Korea. It represents the attitude shift over recent decades of tension between the two Koreas. South Koreans have become accustomed to living next to their northern neighbor, which often releases bellicose statements and calls it a ""group of puppet traitors."" ""Even though there are still many threats, very significant threats like nuclear weapons, we are quite used to those,"" said Lee, about her thoughts on the latest provocation from North Korea. Last month, North Korea announced plans to carry out a new nuclear test and more long-range rocket launches. The very next day, Pyongyang also issued a direct threat to South Korea, and warned of ""strong physical counter-measures"" if the nation participated in U.N. sanctions. In South Korea, life carried on. For many people, domestic concerns far outweigh worries about inter-Korea relations. ""South Korea is always dealing with North Korea, there are always reports in the South Korean media that North Korea is threatening this and that,"" said Karl Friedhoff, program officer of the Public Opinion Studies Center at the Asan Institute for Policy Studies based in Seoul. ""It's a psychological thing where when you live under a constant threat, at some point you move on and it becomes life as usual. I think that's what has happened."" The institute's polls in South Korea indicate domestic concerns such as the economy and job creation heavily outweigh concerns about North Korea, even after a controversial rocket launch by Pyongyang in December that drew international condemnation. Even if North Korea tests a nuclear weapon, Friedhoff does not expect it to raise concerns in South Korea. North Korea's failed missile launch ""did very little to move the needle on public opinion. Then, when it came to December, the thought was if this [launch] is successful, maybe that will do something. But it also did nothing to move the needle,"" he said, referring to the polls on public opinion. ""If there is a nuclear test, I don't anticipate that it's going to have any effect either,"" Friedhoff added. Lee said she was not too concerned about North Korea's possible nuclear testing. ""If they have nuclear weapon, I don't think war will start very easily,"" she said. The economic interruptions to regional countries like China, Russia and Japan, would prompt the international community to prevent war and instability on the Korean Peninsula, she added. South Koreans tend to view North Koreans as a neighbor (33%) or as one of them (32%), according to 2012 Asan Institute data. About 19% said they considered North Koreans as enemies, 10% as strangers and 6% reported no interest, in a nationwide poll that included 2,000 South Koreans. North and South signed an armistice in 1953 that ended fighting in the Korean War but a formal peace treaty has never been signed. Since then, menacing rhetoric from Pyongyang has become part of daily life for Koreans, citizens said. ""There's some difference between other countries views and Koreans' view about this recent North Korea nuclear provocation,"" said Yoon Dong Keun, a college student living near Seoul, who described heightened global concern outside of Korea. His friends received calls from their friends in the United States inquiring about their safety. ""Most of South Korea is not taking those actions as seriously as others,"" he said. ""There are so many series of provocation and action. There's few times the provocation came upright to a threat to our security."" In 2010, the North shelled the South Korean island of Yeonpyeong leaving two marines and two civilians dead. Pyongyang claimed Seoul provoked the attack by holding a military drill off their shared coast in the Yellow Sea. That same year, North Korea was also accused of sinking a South Korean warship, killing more than 40 sailors. The incidents caused widespread anger in the South. ""We can't say a North Korea [incident] will never happen,"" Yoon said. Regarding the latest nuclear testing, he said ""It seems like North Korea's brinkmanship. They just want to blackmail or threaten other countries so they can get bigger aid or they can use or get bigger influence in other countries."" North Korea's rhetoric has fluctuated in recent weeks. At the beginning of January, the nation's leader Kim Jong Un struck a conciliatory tone on relations with the South, saying that removing ""confrontation"" between the two sides would be important in bringing about their reunification. However, on February 1, North Korea's state-run media declared that ""peaceful reunification can never be expected on the Korean Peninsula and the Korean nation can never escape disaster unless the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean regime are eliminated."" On Sunday, the country announced that its leader had made an ""important decision"" to strengthen the nation, although it was unclear. Despite provocations of a nuclear test, Seung Il Hong, a South Korean described the response of people as ""calm"" and noted that stock markets in Korea and abroad had been stable. ""If Kim Jong Un attempts to do a nuclear test again, it will be the third time. I think the average Korean person has become relatively insensitive to North Korean nuclear tests,"" he said. Hong also pointed to the efforts of South Korea's president-elect Park Geun-hye who has called for shortening the required military service for men from two years to 1.5 years, as an indication that Koreans are not distressed over the provocations. South Koreans differentiate between the North Korean people and its leadership, Hong said. ""Most of the Korean people don't seem to think the North Korean people are the enemy,"" Hong said. They consider the government hostile to South Korea, he added.","South Korean citizens are accustomed to North's threatening statements .
Threats to South Korea have become the norm, for many it's not a source of concern .
Survey shows rocket launches and nuclear testing did not sway South Korean opinion ."
"(CNN) -- The young man wanted in the vandalism of a Picasso masterpiece at a Houston museum has been identified and charged, authorities said Friday. Uriel Landeros, 22, was captured on a cell phone video spray painting a bull and the word ""Conquista"" in gold onto Pablo Picasso's ""Woman in a Red Armchair,"" Houston Crime Stoppers said in a statement. ""Conquista"" is Spanish for ""conquest."" The video was uploaded to YouTube, and a Crime Stoppers tip identified Landeros, the statement said. Landeros, who has not been apprehended, is a University of Houston student known to spend time at a local art studio, said Harris County Assistant District Attorney John Lewis. Landeros was charged with criminal mischief and felony graffiti, both third-degree felonies, Lewis said. Warrants have been issued for his arrest. The student has numerous ties to the Houston area and investigators suspect he is still in the area, Lewis told CNN. Earlier this week, a museum spokeswoman said the 1929 painting was expected to hang again soon. ""The painting went directly to the on-site conservation lab down the hall,"" said museum spokeswoman Gretchen Sammons. ""The damage is being undone and the prognosis is excellent.""

"Boston (CNN) -- In the 14 years he lived as a drug addict, former NBA player Chris Herren had no shortage of moments that could have been his ""rock bottom."" The earliest may have come when he was only 18, shortly after Sports Illustrated hyped the local star's matriculation to Boston College. Herren -- then one of the most highly anticipated freshmen basketball players in the country -- left BC after only one game after a positive test for cocaine. Maybe it could have come a few years later, after he had transferred to Fresno State. Just days after one of the most brilliant games of his college career, he announced to a national audience at a news conference that he had once again failed a drug test. Or maybe rock bottom came in 2001, when Herren's family and friends joined the packed crowd at Boston's Fleet Center to witness Herren fulfill his childhood dream of playing for the Boston Celtics. Even though he was in the starting lineup, Herren was nowhere to be found among the players warming up on the fabled parquet floor. Instead, he stood in full uniform outside the Fleet Center in the pouring rain, waiting on a dealer just moments before the game. Herren shot heroin into his veins before his mother's funeral, bailed on his wife and newborn son in the hospital to get drunk, and even had to be brought back to life once after an overdose. But it wasn't any one of these moments that finally motivated him to get the treatment he needed to overcome his addiction. Herren did not have one singular moment of rock bottom. ""Addiction is rock bottom"" he said in a recent interview. ""I had 14 years of rock bottom."" Now three-and-a-half years sober, Herren looks back at those dark moments of his life with glib honesty and an almost macabre sense of gratefulness. Making that buy on a street corner in his Celtics uniform? ""Just another normal day in the life of an addict,"" he said. Using heroin before a game? ""I couldn't play without it in my system."" The overdose that almost killed him? ""It was a blessing."" Burying his mother while he was on heroin? ""When I tell the story about getting high before my mother's funeral -- the looks of disgust people give me -- those looks mean everything to me now."" Opinion: Addiction is not hopeless . Herren said those looks of disgust help him stay on the straight and narrow because he had never before been on the receiving end of such confrontational shows of disapproval. No one had ever looked him in the eye and told him what he already knew: that he was a junkie. ""I used to tell myself that I was no good all of the time,"" he said. ""But it's much harder to look someone else in the eye and say the same thing."" When Herren was finally ready to dedicate himself to getting clean in 2008, he was met with a new challenge, one as daunting as kicking heroin, and one that he says helps perpetuate the cycle of addiction: the cost of effective treatment. ""Unless you have the very best insurance, you'll only get eight or nine days,"" he said. ""You can't expect someone to run the streets for 10 years and come out clean in 10 days."" Herren knew effective treatment for him was going to need to last more than 10 days, and because he squandered all of his earnings to feed his addiction over the years, he also knew there was no way he could afford to overcome it himself. That's when Chris Mullin, his friend and former NBA mentor, emerged to give Herren the assist of a lifetime. Mullin, a Hall of Famer and a recovering alcoholic, arranged for Herren to spend nine months getting clean in the type of intensive rehabilitation that he knew Herren needed so badly. Although Herren still doesn't know exactly how Mullin made that happen, he is sure of one thing: ""If it weren't for Chris Mullin and his family, I probably wouldn't be here."" It was his inability to access effective treatment, combined with his desire to repay Mullin's kindness, that inspired Herren to launch his own nonprofit in 2011. In one year, the Herren Project has already privately paid for more than 100 addicts to receive the treatment they otherwise could never have afforded on their own. Read more about addiction . Effective treatment doesn't come cheap. At Gosnold on Cape Cod, a place where Herren spent three of his nine months in recovery, treatment runs $17,500 a month, according to Gosnold CEO Raymond Tamasi. But that doesn't deter Herren, who says that ""for some cases, we've paid for three months if it's needed."" As part of his work with his foundation, Herren crisscrosses the country, visiting high schools, colleges and prisons to tell his raw and jarring tale. In 2011, ESPN Films wove together scenes from those assemblies for a documentary about him called ""Unguarded"" that chronicled his rise and fall from stardom amid his descent and emergence from the abyss of addiction. That same year, Herren wrote ""Basketball Junkie,"" a memoir in which he refuses to spare readers a single anguishing detail about his harrowing journey. But if anyone thinks Herren wasted his talent or his life, he doesn't see it that way. ""People come up to me now and pity me, they call me a 'poor thing,' "" he said. ""I was a 'poor thing' for 14 years. My life is second to none now."" That life is in Portsmouth, Rhode Island, these days, where Herren, 36, spends his days marveling over the routine tasks of waking his children up for school every morning and putting them to bed every night -- a ritual he calls his proudest achievement. He also spends a lot of his time at a nearby gym, running his eponymous basketball clinics for boys and girls of all skill levels. Here is where Herren's life has come full circle. He spent 14 years using basketball to fuel his addiction. Today, his basketball clinics also have another purpose, this time a positive one: It might look like he is teaching kids the mechanics of a jump shot, or a pick-n-roll, or a full-court press, but what he is really doing is teaching them to discover their self-esteem. And that's something Herren didn't get around to doing for himself until he got sober.","Former NBA player Chris Herren struggled with drug addiction for 14 years .

"(CNN) -- On Tuesday, President Barack Obama was at the Capitol, joining leaders of Congress to dedicate a statue in honor of the ""Mother of the Civil Rights Movement,"" Alabama's Rosa Parks. About the same time, across the street at the Supreme Court, an Alabama lawyer was arguing that a key provision of the Voting Rights Act -- the consequence and legacy of the Civil Rights Movement -- was unnecessary and unconstitutional. The irony lies not only in the timing or juxtaposition, but the institutions. On December 1, 1955, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat when a white bus driver ordered her to move. Twelve years earlier, the same driver had grabbed her coat sleeve and pushed her off his bus for trying to enter through the front rather than the back door. This time he said, ""Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested."" She replied, ""You may do that."" Her arrest led to a 381-day boycott of Montgomery buses by the black community. The boycott propelled the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. to prominence as a civil rights leader. And the arrest of Parks and the boycott she inspired led to a civil law suit, Browder v. Gayle, in which the Supreme Court declared the Alabama and Montgomery laws requiring segregated buses unconstitutional. It took Congress 10 years to catch up to the Supreme Court, when it passed the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Although Alabama's at it again with the new challenge, this time it seems the conservative majority of the Supreme Court wants to roll back the clock. Frank C. Ellis Jr., the attorney for plaintiff Shelby County, argues that Congress exceeded its authority in 2006 when it reauthorized Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years. Toobin: Chief justice out to end affirmative action . Section 5 is the heart of the VRA. Areas of the country with a history of voter suppression and intimidation -- determined decades ago by a formula devised by Congress -- must submit any changes in their election laws to the Department of Justice for clearance. The jurisdictions covered include six Southern states, Alaska and parts of other states, including California, Florida, New Hampshire and sections of New York City. Congress did extensive research before reauthorizing the act in 2006, and recent studies prove Section 5 works well in targeting places where discriminatory voter practices exist. This is evidenced by successful lawsuits brought under Section 2 of the VRA, which bars ""voting qualification"" that ""results in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color."" As Justice Elena Kagan pointed out, ""under any formula that Congress could devise,"" Alabama would still be a targeted state. But neither facts, history or legal precedent deterred Justice Antonin Scalia from deciding he alone would be better qualified to do Congress' job. He said last week that Section 5 amounted to a ""perpetuation of racial entitlement"" that ""will be re-enacted in perpetuity unless a court can say it does not comport with the Constitution. ... It's a concern that this is not the kind of a question you can leave to Congress ... even the Virginia senators ... are going to lose votes if they do not re-enact."" So, protecting the right to vote -- not just of blacks, by the way, but of Native Americans in Alaska, Hispanics in California, and even French-speaking Americans in New Hampshire -- is a ""racial entitlement."" And legislative questions can't be left to Congress. And -- horrors! -- a senator's vote might be influenced by how the citizens he represents will respond. After all, that democracy thing might interfere with Scalia's judicial fiats. Four years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote, with respect to Section 5, that ""things have changed in the South."" Really? Tell that to the citizens of the five Florida counties covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. This year, Florida tried to cut early voting hours in those counties. A panel of federal judges refused to allow it, thanks to Section 5. (Guess who would have been disenfranchised if the cutback had gone through?) A panel of federal judges in Texas also knows that times have not changed. That's why they rejected, again under Section 5, a new photo ID law that would have imposed ""strict, unforgiving burdens"" on poor and minority voters. Under that proposal, by the way, you could vote with a gun license but not a student or veteran's ID. Another justice, last week, raised the specter of ""state sovereignty."" A little history, courtesy of President Abraham Lincoln, in remarks to Congress given on July 4, 1861: ""...no one of our states, except Texas, ever was a sovereignty; and even Texas gave up the character on coming into the Union..."" (As did Hawaii.) Much as Scalia and his cohorts would like to legislate -- or dictate -- from the bench, the Supreme Court can only decide if a law is constitutional. And as a Harvard Law Review essay argues, Congress authorized preclearance -- Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act -- under Section 5 of the 14th Amendment. And that makes it constitutional. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Donna Brazile.","Donna Brazile: The high court heard arguments on Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act .

"LOS ANGELES, California (CNN) -- Flannery O'Connor did not expect to become the subject of a biography. She thought the narrow borders of her life -- lived ""between the house and the chicken yard"" -- wouldn't give a writer much to work with. Author Flannery O'Connor (here with two of her peacocks) remains a subject of fascination for many. It would therefore come as a surprise (and probably secretly please her) to learn she is the focus of at least three. The latest is ""Flannery: A Life of Flannery O'Connor"" (Little, Brown) by Brad Gooch, an exhaustively researched exploration of O'Connor's unlikely journey from shy, sarcastic and ""contrary"" Georgia girl to acerbic literary treasure. That she suffered from lupus and died before the age of 40 is well-known to fans of O'Connor. But Gooch uncovers much that even ardent followers of the author will find revealing, including details of her college career as a cartoonist, and her time in Iowa City at the Iowa Writers' Workshop. The book manages to synthesize what seems difficult to reconcile: how such a chaste, religious person could produce stories that are bitingly funny and filled with shocking violence.  Watch O'Connor's fascinating story » . Gooch spoke with CNN about his experience researching the biography. What follows is an edited version of the interview. CNN: When did you first discover Flannery O'Connor? Brad Gooch: I first read her stories in my 20s and loved them, and then a little later, the [collected] letters came up, ""The Habit of Being."" And I'd had a few hunches about her from reading the stories, which were a little mysterious. ... And then when I read the letters, a lot of those hunches seemed true. ... Trying to put the life of this woman together with the stories became as interesting as the stories to me. CNN: She wasn't always known as Flannery O'Connor. Gooch: Her name was Mary Flannery O'Connor, and her mother and everyone in Milledgeville (Georgia), where she lived most of her life, continued to call her Mary Flannery. But when she went to Iowa City -- the Iowa Writers' Workshop -- early on, she decided she wanted to be a writer, and she decided on the name Flannery. She later said, ""Who would want to buy these stories of an Irish washerwoman named Mary O'Connor?"" Partly, I think she wanted to lose the Southern-ness of ""Mary Flannery."" ...  Also, Flannery was a gender-neutral name. ... Her initial rejection letters were actually addressed to ""Mr. Flannery O'Connor,"" and I think she kind of liked that neutrality. CNN: What did you find most remarkable about her? Gooch: I think the discipline of her writing becomes ... almost inspiring. She developed lupus when she was 25, she lived until she was 39. And in that period, she kept up this regimen that she had begun at the Iowa Writers' Workshop of writing every morning for three hours, even if it meant sitting in front of a blank page. ... [Near the end of her life] she was editing her final stories and hiding them under the pillow in the hospital from the doctors so that she could go on. She was still working on her last story after she had last rites. ... All of that is a sort of [a] level of commitment that is startling and unmatched. CNN: Her stories are often funny, yet disturbing. Gooch: Her style goes under these names, like grotesque or gothic, but she was really crossing these two wires of humor and almost this kind of dark theological writing that had never been put together before. ... [In ""A Good Man is Hard to Find""] a family on vacation ... meets someone named the Misfit, this ex-con in the woods. ... And he winds up shooting the entire family while spouting existentialist, nihilist philosophy. And in that story, there's always a point where you keep laughing past this line, and suddenly someone's being shot and you're laughing and then [readers] get very uncomfortable. They can't tell whether this is supposed to be funny or not, and I think that O'Connor definitely works in that territory, where you can't tell if she's being funny or tragic and serious. CNN: The titles of her stories and novels are so wonderful -- ""A Good Man Is Hard to Find,"" ""Everything That Rises Must Converge,"" ""The Life You Save May Be Your Own,"" ""The Violent Bear It Away."" Gooch: ""A Good Man is Hard to Find"" was a Bessie Smith song; ""Everything That Rises Must Converge"" she got from Teilhard de Chardin, a favorite Catholic theologian of hers. You see in a way how sophisticated she was in her approach to her writing. I think sometimes when people read the stories, they confuse O'Connor with the character in her story, and they think she is some Grandma-Moses-crazy-folk-artist, but actually she was an incredibly educated artist who had read everything, including a lot of theology. ... The titles ... are attracting and punchy, but you also see that she's working kind of consciously with these reverberating references. CNN: What do you make of her fascination with birds? Gooch: When she was forced by lupus to move back to the South and live on a dairy farm with her mother in Georgia, one of the first things she did besides getting very serious about working on her stories was to order a peacock. And eventually she had 39 peacocks. ... And I think that she was very conscious that the peacock was this gawky, comic bird. I think she identified with the peacock for that reason. The peacock squawked all night and annoyed people, ate her mother's flowers, and yet, at this certain willful moment, opened its tail and revealed what she called this ""map of the universe."" So, I think it really stood in a way for this kind of transfiguration that would take place for her spiritually but also in the beauty of her writing. ... She definitely made an effort to make the peacock her own personal logo. CNN: What is her literary reputation 45 years after her death? Gooch: She seems to be ever more popular. When she died she was considered almost a minor writer. Her second volume of stories hadn't even come out; her ""Collected Stories"" was published in the early 1970s and got a posthumous National Book Award. It seems that every decade, interest in her grows. When the Library of America put out her collected works 10 years ago, she outsold Faulkner. So she has this popularity and interest. And [she] increasingly shows up in funny pop culture ways. I think in the last episode of ""Lost"" the character was reading ""Everything That Rises Must Converge"" in the last scene. So, counterintuitively, she's only growing in importance. CNN: It's amazing that she had a literary career at all, given how debilitating her illness was. Gooch: What became inspiring to me, unexpectedly, writing this book [was how she dealt] with her illness, and that she finally was nobody's victim. ... Everything we think of as a Flannery O'Connor story came after she had been diagnosed as having lupus and settled in to life in the South. You get the sense that this was almost a magical thinking, where she thought that writing these stories was keeping her alive.","New biography of Flannery O'Connor offers insights on Southern author .

"(CNN) -- A federal agency in charge of safety on the roads wants an outright ban on using mobile phones while driving. But what if we're just too hooked on our smartphones and other digital gadgets to care? For many drivers in 2011, a phone is as vital an in-car accessory as a radio, a map or a cup holder. Spend a few minutes watching motorists backed up at a traffic light and you'll see a large chunk of them on their smartphones: talking, texting, peering at a digital map or playing ""Angry Birds."" Enough, says the National Transportation Safety Board, which on Tuesday issued its most sweeping recommendation on mobile-phone use yet -- that all nonemergency talking, texting or other use by drivers be made illegal. That would include hands-free devices as well as handheld ones. Reaction has been heated. There seems to be across-the-board agreement, even on the part of some self-admitted offenders, that a ban on drivers using their hands to text and talk makes sense. But after that, things get more complicated. And some critics are saying that any law targeting phone use in cars is already too late. ""Mobile phones are omnipresent. Virtually every adult and many kids have one,"" Detroit Free Press auto columnist Mark Phelan wrote Wednesday. ""No law will change the fact that people expect to remain in touch while they're behind the wheel."" The NTSB's proposed ban, he said, would be ""the most pointless and universally ignored law since Prohibition."" ""Imagine the old 55-mph speed limit, only without radar detectors,"" he wrote. In the United States, more than 35% of adults own a Web-enabled smartphone and more than 83% own a mobile phone of some kind, according to a recent Pew study. At any given daylight moment, some 13.5 million U.S. drivers are on handheld phones, according to a study released last week by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Some 3,092 roadway fatalities last year involved distracted drivers, although the actual number may be far higher, the NHTSA said. Federal officials have taken to calling phone use behind the wheel ""the new DUI."" Alex Hughes of Austin, Texas, says he doesn't use his phone while actively driving. But at stoplights, he admitted, he'll do everything from texting and checking e-mail to reading news stories, checking Facebook and posting to Twitter. ""I like to be able to maximize the use of my time,"" he said. ""I don't see there being a big harm in multitasking when my car is stopped so long as I maintain awareness of what traffic around me is doing."" Many CNN Tech readers who responded to a call for thoughts on the issue said they don't understand a distinction the NTSB plan makes between phones and systems that come installed in cars, like Ford's SYNC, which enables voice calls, online music services and other phone-like features. ""I make and receive phone calls via my hands-free equipment and I use the phone for GPS navigation. All of this I could do freely if I have the right optional extras in my car,"" said Trevor Cudmore of Bayport, New York. ""Should radios and GPS navigation also be banned from cars? Laws exist in most states banning texting and making phone calls without hand-free equipment -- the issue is that these laws are not being enforced. "" The use of mobile GPS also was mentioned frequently by both readers and online pundits. Virtually every mobile operating system has some sort of mapping app to help drivers get from Point A to Point B. What sense does it make, the logic goes, to ban phones in the car while allowing apps that are created, almost exclusively, to be used in the car? ""(G)iven that GPS is now an integral part of most smartphones, and that services like OnStar integrate voice commands to phones via Bluetooth, it's not clear how effective or enforceable a total ban would be -- or whether it would change the behavior of drivers in a significant way,"" wrote Sean Gallagher for tech blog Ars Technica, a CNN content partner. ""Bans on handheld phone use haven't significantly reduced the likelihood of drivers to take incoming calls while they're driving regardless of the type of phone they have."" A bigger safety issue could arise, Cudmore said, if such tools are banned. ""If cell phones are banned, those of us without GPS installed in the car will need to revert back to paper maps or printed directions,"" he said. Which is more dangerous, listening to my phone's GPS navigation or reading a set of printed instructions? Let's be honest, before GPS when everyone used maps, did we all pull over to the side of the road to read the next instruction once we reached a waypoint? If used correctly, these devices are improving safety."" Any ban on cell phone use in cars probably wouldn't become law for a while. The NTSB doesn't have any lawmaking power and Congress would have to pass any law regarding phones and driving, although the safety board has helped push ideas into law before. Getting such a law through Congress, given the current gridlock in Washington, could be a torturous process. Currently a patchwork of laws governs cell phone usage by drivers. Some 35 states ban text messaging while driving, 30 states ban cell phone use by novice drivers, and 10 ban all use of handheld cell phones, according to the NTSB.","Federal board suggests a ban on phones while driving, but many balk at the idea .
Many support banning texting while driving, but say hands-free, GPS should remain legal .

"(CNN) -- Sarai Sierra followed her passion to Istanbul -- a budding photographer lured by the possibilities the picturesque, ancient city has to offer. But the day before she was supposed to fly back home, the 33-year-old mother of two went missing. Sierra had taken up photography last year, posting her work to the photo sharing app Instagram and quickly amassing 3,000 followers. Some people she met through the service encouraged her to visit Istanbul, her husband, Steven, said. They offered to act as tour guides, he said. ""You're admiring pictures, but you're getting acquainted with people that you've never met before,"" the husband said. He thought the trip was a great idea for his wife. Now, he can't help but wonder whether she should have trusted people she met online. Traveling alone . Sierra had originally planned to travel with a friend, who canceled, her husband said. She flew alone to Istanbul on January 7. ""She did a lot of researching about the area, about where she was going to stay, the safest places to go and the time of day to travel,"" her friend Magalena Rodriguez said. After her arrival, she began posting pictures to Instagram and stayed in touch with family back home via Skype. Her photo feed displayed images of Istanbul's beautiful skyline and historic landmarks. She also squeezed in an excursion to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and to Germany, starting January 15, where she went to photograph graffiti. She returned to Istanbul on January 19. Three days later all signs of life from Sierra ceased. No-show on flight home . Sierra had rebooked her flight to arrive back early, on January 22, in part to surprise her two sons, 9 and 11. Just days before her scheduled trip home, Sierra spoke with her father David Jimenez via Skype to remind him of her flight number and arrival time. On January 21, she messaged her sister to say she was glad to be heading back to New York. When Jimenez went to Newark airport to pick Sierra up, she didn't show, he said. The airline told him she had never checked in for the flight. ""She kept in contact with us all the time,"" Sierra's mother, Betzaida Jimenez, said. ""And then not to hear from her? It's not like her."" On Monday, Steven Sierra landed in Istanbul with his wife's brother to help police search for her. The next day, police released a surveillance camera video of Sarai at a shopping mall, flipping through her iPad. The scenes from January 20 are the last known images of her. Last signs of life . The manager of the small private hotel where Sierra was staying reported last seeing her the day the surveillance video was shot. That was a Sunday. Her Skype account, which she avidly used, went silent a day later. A day after that was when she missed her flight home. The time she last talked with her family, Sierra was planning to see the Galata Bridge and visit the Asian side of Istanbul, her husband said. The former capital of the Byzantine and East Roman empires straddles the continents of Europe and Asia. After her family raised the alarm that she was missing, some of her belongings -- including her passport and medical cards -- were found in her room in Istanbul, though her iPhone and iPad were not there, according to her husband. A heartbroken family . Her parents can't watch the surveillance video. It's too painful. ""I wish she was close, wish she was close by, so I could reach out and grab her and bring her back,"" her father said. Steven Sierra has lost his appetite for living and sometimes wishes that one morning he just wouldn't wake up. But he has to keep going for the sake of his children. ""I would never wish this on anybody,"" he said. ""There's times when...you feel like you're gonna lose it mentally."" He says he wants to be there to protect her, wants to make sure she is not cold or hungry. But all he can do is wait. And hope.

"Washington (CNN) -- A Maryland man accused of making threats against his workplace and who had a large cache of legally owned weapons was charged Wednesday with a misdemeanor, according to state officials. Neil Prescott, 28, has been charged with misuse of a telephone and will be formally arrested once he is released from a hospital, where he's been undergoing a court-ordered mental evaluation. Prescott was taken into custody early Friday morning and a search of his home revealed about 25 weapons, including hand guns and assault rifles, along with 40 large steel boxes of assorted ammunition, officials said. Maryland man who called himself 'joker' taken into custody . Angela Alsobrooks, the state's attorney for Prince George's County, said that although Prescott allegedly made serious threats, it was not possible to bring felony charges. ""Maryland does not have a statute on the books that makes it expressly illegal for a person to communicate generalized threats over the telephone,"" said Alsobrooks. She said Maryland should have a stronger law about such threats and that she would lobby for one. Alsobrooks also said no weapons charges could be brought because Prescott owns his guns legally. Prescott worked as a subcontractor for Pitney Bowes and was in the process of being fired. On July 23, he was on the phone with a supervisor and allegedly said several times, ""I am a joker. I'm going to load my guns and blow everybody up,"" according to local police. Police officials said they took the threats seriously and were sensitive to the use of the word 'joker' in the aftermath of the July 20 mass shooting at an Aurora, Colorado, movie complex showing the latest Batman movie, ""The Dark Knight Rises."" The Joker was the villain in a previous film in the series and also appears in the comic book series that inspired the films. Suspect James Holmes was arrested in the Aurora shootings and charged with murdering 12 people and wounding dozens more. Alsobrooks said that Prescott is still hospitalized in Maryland. If convicted on the misdemeanor charge, he faces a maximum sentence of three years in jail, a fine of $500 or both. In a Friday news conference, police also revealed that when they interviewed Prescott on Thursday, he was wearing a T-shirt saying, ""Guns don't kill people. I do."" Later that day, a judge issued an order for Prescott to be hospitalized for evaluation. Analysis: Fewer U.S. gun owners own more guns . Democrats propose limits on online ammo sales .

"(CNN) -- Afghan President Hamid Karzai in February accused U.S. forces of ""torture"" and ""murder"" in the restive Wardak province. Now Western powers will pull out of one of its districts after reaching an agreement with Karzai on the area's future. Coalition troops and Afghan police will withdraw from the Nerkh District near Kabul, said spokesman Gen. Joseph F. Dunford of the International Security Assistance Force on Wednesday. Afghan National Security Forces will replace them there ""soon."" NATO has insisted it cannot substantiate the accusations by the government in Kabul. Wardak is known as the province where the United States suffered its largest loss of life in a single day in the war in Afghanistan. In August 2011, the Taliban shot down a Chinook helicopter killing 38 on board, including 22 Navy SEALs and other members of U.S. special operations forces. Karzai has accused a ""U.S. special force"" operating in Wardak of ""harassing, annoying, torturing and even murdering innocent people,"" according to a statement at the time. But the complaints did not originate with the Afghan leader, a local official has said. Dozens of residents of Wardak approached Hazrat Janan, a member of the local provincial council, complaining about attacks. A delegation then reported them to Karzai, Janan said. Other residents and officials in the region have also reported incidents of violence by U.S. troops. Nine people ""disappeared in an operation"" by a ""suspicious force,"" according to the statement from Karzai's office. It also described an incident in which a student was taken from his home at night. His ""tortured body with (its) throat cut was found two days later under a bridge,"" it said. The alleged incidents have ignited resentment and anger. Wardak a key location . Wardak is strategically important because it's often used as a main route by insurgents trying to gain access to Kabul, the Afghan capital. U.S. forces have carried out months of special operations to vanquish Taliban fighters in the province. But raids have deeply offended some Afghans angry about foreigners entering their homes. U.S. officials have said the raids are vital to NATO's operation against insurgents. The once good relationship between the American and Afghan troops cooperating in the operations seems to have gone sour, Janan said. And tensions between them have risen. Earlier this month, a man wearing an ANSF uniform fired at U.S. troops with a truck-mounted machine gun, killing two of them, including one Green Beret. The gunman wounded 10 more Americans. Coalition forces returned fire, killing him. A deal struck between United States and Afghanistan in April 2012 gives Kabul the right to veto U.S. operations in the country. Karzai made use of it in Wardak this year and ordered some U.S. special operations forces to leave the province to avoid more trouble. Some Afghans fear a Taliban resurgence if they all disappear from the region. ""In the last year U.S. special forces destroyed almost 70% of the Taliban and other insurgents in Wardak province without causing any civilian casualties,"" said an Afghan political analyst in Wardak who asked not to be identified, fearing retribution. He said he is sure that without the Americans, insurgents will have a grip on Wardak in ""less than a year,"" which will give them easy access to Kabul.","Karzai accused a ""U.S. special force"" of torture and murder in Wardak province .

"(CNN) -- Malala Yousafzai, the Pakistani teenager whom the Taliban tried to murder, is asking a graduate school not to name its institution after her. Girls were afraid that attending the Malala Yousafzai Post Graduate College for Women in the Taliban-dominated Swat Valley would attract the attention of fighters like the ones who gunned down Malala and two other girls on a school bus in October, according to Kamran Rehman Khan, a top official in the Swat Valley. The Saidu Sharif Post Graduate School briefly changed its name to recognize Malala's brave campaign for girls' education in Pakistan. The Taliban are against girls being in the classroom and have threatened to kill anyone who defies them. Several students told Khan that they respect Malala but are concerned about their safety, he said. Khan told CNN that Malala called him Monday evening from her hospital room in England where she's recovering from bullet wounds to her head and neck. She wants the school to remove her name, but she wishes for people to continue to fight for girls to go to school, he said. ""I was so impressed that despite having threats against her life, she was talking about girls' education in the region and against militants,"" Khan said. Malala first got an international platform at age 11 when the BBC gave her a chance to write a blog about going to school despite a Taliban edict forbidding girls in the classroom. She gave an interview to CNN and other outlets, bravely insisting that girls had every right to an education. On October 9, the 15-year-old was on a school van in Swat Valley. Taliban gunmen stopped the vehicle and demanded that other girls tell them which one was Malala. They did. She was shot, as were two other girls who survived the attack. ""We do not tolerate people like Malala speaking against us,"" a Taliban spokesman later said, vowing to come after her if she managed to live. Malala was in critical condition, but doctors in England have helped her recover over the past several months. She suffered no major brain or nerve damage. She is walking, writing and reading again. Malala was selected as runner-up for Time magazine's Person of the Year.","Official: Girls at school newly named after the teen said they were afraid .

"(CNN) -- Standing just feet from the gunman in Monday's deadly Ohio school shooting, Danny Komertz has no doubt about what he saw. The Chardon High School freshman was walking with friends when they heard a loud pop. He looked up. ""I looked straight ahead and I saw a gun pointing at a group of four guys sitting a table ... He just fired two quick shots at them. I saw one student fall, and I saw the other hiding, trying to get cover underneath the table,"" Komertz told CNN. ""He was aiming right at them as he was two feet away ... He wasn't shooting around the cafeteria at all. He was directly aiming at the four of them,"" he said. Komertz was lucky; he wasn't hit. Five others were when a young man allegedly opened fire on that table of students in the Chardon High School cafeteria, killing one and seriously injuring four. Police arrested the suspected shooter a short time later. They have identified him as a juvenile, and witnesses told CNN the gunman was T.J. Lane, a student. Komertz, 15, said he heard some five shots -- the last two as he and his friends were running out the doors toward safety. ""I was very scared of what was going to happen so I didn't look at his face. I just looked at the gun and I ran,"" he said. Another witness, Nate Mueller, had his ear grazed by one of the gunman's bullets. He was sitting at a table next to the suspected shooter. ""All of a sudden we heard a loud bang, almost like a firework. We turned around and I saw T.J. standing at the table behind us with his gun pointed and firing,"" said Mueller. ""His first shot made me look. His second shot I watched him take, which hit somebody behind me, and his third shot hit me as I was turning away."" Mueller described the gunman as stoic and silent. As he unloaded his weapon, his face was ""expressionless,"" Mueller said. ""There was no warning or anything. He just opened fire."" Other students recalled being further away from the shooting, but no less scared. Josh Sophacak was walking outside the cafeteria when the first shot fired. ""It sounded like a firecracker ... I paused and everything went into slow motion from there. I guess I was in shock,"" he said. Yet for all the misery caused by Monday's shooting, witnesses have also described the makings of a hero. Assistant football coach and study hall teacher Frank Hall chased the gunman out of the school, they said. ""Coach Hall, he always talks about how much he cares about us students, his team and everyone. And I think today he really went out and he proved how much he cared about us. He would take a bullet for us,"" said Neil Thomas, a student. Thomas was in Spanish class when the gunshots started. An administrator came over an intercom system to announce a lock down, he said, sending teachers and students scurrying to the corners of rooms for cover. Sophacak similarly hailed the coach as ""heroic."" Indeed, if not for Hall's quick response and the readiness of the school, which drills students on what to do in emergencies, Monday's death toll may have been much higher. ""As bad as it was already, I think it could have been a lot worse,"" said Evan Erasmus, a Chardon senior.","Witnesses at Chardon High School describe feeling scared .

"(CNN) -- Approximately 1,200 Marines serving in southwestern Afghanistan will have their tours of duty extended by 30 days, Pentagon and Marine officials said. U.S. Marines take a break at Camp Dwyer, located south of Helmand province in Afghanistan. The Marines, most coming from the Marine Corps Air Ground Combat Center at Twentynine Palms, California, will come home at the end of November instead of the beginning of that month, the officials said. Also, 200 additional support troops and several helicopters will be sent to southwestern Afghanistan to help with route clearance, engineering and additional aviation elements, officials said, citing orders that were signed last week. The Marines have been serving in Farah province as trainers for the Afghan army. They have been repeatedly attacked by insurgents and have been seeking additional firepower. Earlier this summer, the Pentagon approved plans to extend the tours of about 2,000 Marines serving in combat roles in Afghanistan's Helmand province. U.S. military commanders say that until more troops are freed up from Iraq, such minor extensions are the only steps they can take to bolster their combat capability in Afghanistan.","About 1,200 Marines in Afghanistan getting 30-day tour extensions, officials say .

"(CNN) -- In December, Domenick Iammarino drove the 30 miles or so from his home in Solon, Ohio, to deliver Christmas gifts for his grandchildren. For Danny, Iammarino picked out an athletic top and pants. The teenager loved to ski and lamented to his grandfather the mildness of this winter in Chardon, the unofficial snow capital of Ohio. If only Iammarino could hear Danny's voice again, see the smile that always slipped from his lips. Instead Iammarino prepared Tuesday to attend a vigil in Danny's honor. Daniel Parmertor, 16, was one of three students who died in a shooting at Chardon High School the day before. Russell King Jr., 17, was declared brain dead early Tuesday and Demetrius Hewlin died Tuesday morning, his family said in a statement distributed by MetroHealth hospitals in Cleveland. One other student remained hospitalized Tuesday while a fifth victim has been released. Their names have not been released. The students were shot Monday in the school cafeteria. Danny and Russell were waiting for a bus that would have taken them 10 miles down Route 44 to the Auburn Career Center, said Superintendent Maggie Lynch. Danny was taking a class on the Cisco Computer Network. Russell was enrolled in an alternative energy program. Lynch spoke to CNN before it was known that Demetrius had died. Danny learned things like how to combine networks and infrastructure ability. His class even covered computer hacking. Russell's class built solar panels and windmills. The two began taking classes in August at the career center to augment high school courses. They were among the 368 high school juniors from 11 neighboring school districts. Iammarino's phone rang at about 9:30 Monday morning. What he heard on the line knocked him back, and he struggled to steady himself. Maybe, he thought, it was one of those school scuffles he always heard about on the news. He'd worked as a wrestling coach at Beachwood High School for 30 years. Kids, these days, he thought, were different. They needed more discipline. Maybe Danny had been shot in the arm, he thought. But then came the news. Danny's mother, Dina, works as a nurse at Hillcrest Hospital. She had just finished the 7 to 7 shift and was on her way home when she was told to report to another hospital, MetroHealth Medical Center, nearly 45 minutes away. Danny's father, Bob, a boiler technician at First Energy, had also just finished an overnight shift. Neither would speak to their middle child again. They were ""torn by the loss,"" they said in a brief statement. ""Danny was a bright young boy who had a bright future ahead of him."" Iammarino remembered Danny as an introverted kid. He didn't talk much, but he had a wry sense of humor. Always smiled. Recently, he'd landed a part-time job at a bowling alley where he maintained the computerized pins. ""He liked repair work,"" Iammarino said. By Tuesday afternoon, thousands of people had visited Facebook pages honoring Danny and Russell. Many pledged to wear red, Chardon's school color, in support of the shooting victims and survivors. ""RIP Danny. Such a beautiful life cut way too short. You will never be forgotten,"" one poster to Danny's memorial page wrote. ""My heart aches for your family."" Parmertor's funeral is to be held Saturday. Tuesday evening, Chardon residents were scheduled come together for a prayer service at the Church of St. Mary, near Chardon High School. They will remember the three who died. Russell King's family asked that he be remembered ""for who he was, a strong boy with a big heart. He will be missed by many. He was so full of life and we are honoring his wishes to help others by donating his organs."" Lynch said Russell was more outgoing than Danny and very sociable. He built good rapport with his teachers and classmates and worked well in teams, Lynch said. Kendra Teerman posted a message about Russell, her first cousin, on her Facebook page: . ""Apparently the Lord had decided to call you home today. Although I disagree with his decision, there's nothing I can do to change it. There are no words to express this sudden loss -- I'm shocked and wishing I was just in a bad dream that I'm going to wake up from. Life is not fair, you were taken from us far too soon!"" Russell's tribute page on Facebook mentioned Demetrius, who was then on life support at MetroHealth. The family did not release a statement about his death until Tuesday afternoon. ""We are very saddened by the loss of our son and others in our Chardon community,"" they said. ""Demetrius was a happy young man who loved life and his family and friends. We will miss him very much but we are proud that he will be able to help others through organ donation."" Drew Gittins, a Chardon football player, told the Cleveland Plain Dealer that Demetrius worked out often in the school gym. ""He could do squat lifts really good,"" Gittins told the newspaper. ""He showed up for a few football workouts, but I remember him having struggles with his grades."" Other students who knew Demetrius said he often sat in the cafeteria with a few of the other shooting victims. Chardon student Evan Erasmus said the shooting suspect, described by students as a withdrawn boy named T.J. Lane, knew his victims. However, prosecutor David Joyce said Tuesday that Lane told authorities that he shot at random. Tuesday, community leaders spoke of healing. Chardon High School was closed for the day. At Auburn Career Center, Lynch opened the doors but brought in grief counselors for students and teachers who needed to talk. And at his home in nearby Solon, Iammarino prepared to attend this evening's remembrance of a grandson for whom he will never be able to buy Christmas presents again.","The last time Domenick Iammarino saw his grandson was at Christmas .

"(CNN) -- A federal jury in Pennsylvania on Wednesday ordered Marvell Technology Group, Ltd., to pay $1.17 billion in damages after finding it infringed on two patents held by Carnegie Mellon University. A lawsuit filed in 2009 by the Pittsburgh university claimed that Marvell infringed on its patented technology fundamental for ""increasing the accuracy with which hard disk drive circuits read data from high-speed magnetic disks,"" according to a press release from K&L Gates, the law firm representing Carnegie Mellon. The damages could be increased by as much as three times by U.S. District Court judge Nora Barry Fischer since the jury found chipmaker Marvell's infringements were willful, according to K&L Gates. The jury also found Marvell sold billions of chips incorporating the university's technology without a license to do so, according to K&L Gates. Marvell has denied the claim. It did not immediately reply to messages left Wednesday by CNN. In a statement, Carnegie Mellon said, ""We felt the evidence we submitted was compelling, and the jury agreed. Protection of the discoveries of our faculty and students is very important to us.""","Jury finds chipmaker infringed on university's patents .

"London (CNN) -- I remember well the shock when in 2000 Alex Rodriquez signed a 10 year, a quarter of a billion dollar deal ($252 million) to play baseball with the Texas Rangers. It was beyond reality, and it didn't work out for the Rangers. He was later traded to the Yankees who happily increased the deal. Good for Rodriguez. But at least he was being paid to work. Rory McIlroy has now become Nike's poster boy -- certainly there will be a lot of strings attached; but he's not being paid by Nike to swing a club. He'll get millions more to do that.

TV ads have already been shot. Now, I wonder which stable of Nike's sports stallions will he join? Will he join Roger Federer and Michael Jordan at causing little or no offenses on or off the field of play? Will he join Lance Armstrong and one day cause a massive scandal putting his Nike contract in jeopardy? Or will he join the middle rank of bad boy athletes who's off the field scandals don't cost them their Nike deal; think Kobe Bryant or of course, Tiger Woods. What's the difference? Lance Armstrong is accused of cheating his fans and his beloved sport and cashed in on that cheating. But remember, Nike actually stood by Armstrong for months in 2012, when all others headed for the exit. It seemed to have taken Nike's top brass some time to realize the evidence was too strong to ignore. His upcoming 'confession' will hopefully clarify his involvement in doping. Tiger has never been accused of on-the-field cheating. Still, he lost many of his sponsors while Nike hung on. The others could not stand the heat. For Nike, it's not just about celebrities endorsing products. It's about products themselves. Air Jordans are sold through jumpman23, a fully fledged subsidiary of Nike. It includes endorsements from good guy athletes like CC Sabathia, Derek Jeter and Josh Freeman. Kit sold through Federer and Woods are not subsidiaries of Nike, but you can't miss the connection. In November, Forbes Magazine said Woods ""delivered"" 50% more ($6 million) for his brands than McIlroy in 2012. I wonder if it will be the same will be in 2013, as McIlroy will undoubtedly remain World No. 1 in golf rankings this year and now shoots near the top as a global sports brand.","In November, Forbes Magazine said Woods ""delivered"" 50% more for his brands than McIlroy in 2012.

"(CNN) -- Most 13-year-old boys would be happy to win their local golf club's junior tournament. But Guan Tian-Lang isn't like other boys. The Chinese prodigy is set to make history this week when he smashes the record for the youngest player in a European Tour event. On Thursday, the world junior champion will tee off at the Volvo China Open at the tender age of just 13 years and 177 days, shattering the record set by Taiwan's Lo Shih-Kai -- who was 103 days older when he played at the 2003 Hong Kong Open. Guan narrowly missed out in a qualifying event three weeks ago, but a last-minute clearance by the China Golf Association has given the Guangzhou schoolboy the chance join his heroes at Tianjin Binhai Lake Golf Club in an event co-sanctioned with the OneAsia Tour. He will join an elite 156-man field including Ian Poulter, who finished seventh at this month's U.S. Masters, and the Englishman's fellow Ryder Cup star Paul Casey -- both former top-10 ranked players. ""I really couldn't be happier -- I'm so excited right now,"" Guan said on the European Tour website. ""I was really disappointed to lose out in the playoff and I thought I'd blown a great chance to make history, but then to find out I'm actually going to play is like a dream come true."" But the talented teen isn't just happy to play -- he wants to create more history by making the halfway cut. His compatriot Jason Hak was 14 years and 304 days old when he did so at the 2008 Hong Kong Open. ""My goal now is to be the youngest player ever to make the cut in a European Tour event, and I think if I can shoot level par or better I'll have a good chance to do that,"" Guan said. Guan is also aiming to qualify for the U.S. Open in July, but insists his success on the course has not hampered his studies -- in fact, he's one of the top pupils in his class. ""I don't take schoolwork with me when I travel -- I just work very hard when I'm at school in Guangzhou,"" he said. ""Actually I'm doing pretty well right now and my grades are high. My favorite subjects are English and PE."" Guan, who started playing golf as a four-year-old, claimed the world junior crown last year in San Diego by 11 shots on the back of a flawless first-round 63, featuring nine birdies. He is now tipped to also become the youngest player to ever compete in the Australian Masters in November and Australian Open in December. If he does play Down Under, he may have the chance to follow in the footsteps of New Zealand's Lydia Ko, who at the age of 14 this year became the youngest professional winner at a women's tournament in New South Wales. Japan's Ryo Ishikawa previously held the record when he won on the Japan Tour in 2007, aged 15. ""Anyone who has seen Guan play would not rule him out from making the cut -- he really is a talented young player. He displays a maturity well beyond his 13 years and doesn't seem fazed by spectators or the intrusive nature of the media,"" China Open operations director Alistair Polson said. ""Being a local player I expect he will receive a lot of media attention so I hope he does well and gives the fans something to cheer about.""","China's Guan Tian-Lang, 13, will be the youngest ever player in a European Tour event .

"(CNN) -- A shipyard worker who pleaded guilty to arson in a fire that did at least $400 million in damage to a U.S. nuclear attack submarine has been sentenced to over 17 years in federal prison and ordered to pay $400 million in restitution, federal prosecutors said Friday. Casey James Fury admitted to two counts of arson in November in connection with the blaze aboard the USS Miami last May 23 and a smaller fire beneath the dry-docked submarine in June, according to court papers. The 25-year-old civilian painter and sandblaster at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Maine told investigators that he started the fires because he was having extreme anxiety and was trying to get out of work, the documents state. Fury could have faced life in prison on the charge. But the judge weighed the severe damage caused by the fire and the risk to life that it brought against the fact Fury had never been in criminal trouble before and suffered from anxiety and depression, according to CNN affiliate WGME. Fury was accused of setting fire to a plastic bag full of cotton rags in a cabin in the forward end of the Miami, starting a conflagration that took the ship's crew and firefighters from the shipyard and nearby towns 12 hours to put out. Five firefighters and two sailors were injured during the effort. The fire damaged crew quarters and command-and-control spaces aboard the submarine, the Navy said at the time. The damage was forward of the nuclear reactor that powers the vessel, which had been shut down and was closed off after the fire began, the service reported. ""Today's sentencing hearing of Mr. Fury closes one chapter on last year's historical and tragic experience that impacted our submarine force, disrupted the lives of countless officers, sailors who serve our Navy as well as the maintenance and operational schedule of the entire submarine force,"" said U.S. Navy Rear Adm. Richard Breckenridge at a press conference Friday. The 362-foot Miami was commissioned in 1990 and had been undergoing an extensive overhaul at the Portsmouth shipyard. The Navy says it plans to repair the submarine and return it to service. CNN's Christine Theodorou contributed to this report.","The fire started aboard the USS Miami while the sub was in dry-dock .

"Newtown, Connecticut (CNN) -- Attendance was taken at schools across this devastated town on Tuesday as most students returned to the classroom for the first time since the deadly school shooting. Not everyone was there. Sandy Hook Elementary students won't resume classes until January, and victims of last week's massacre will never return. Jessica Rekos and James Mattioli, both 6, were laid to rest Tuesday, while the families of Charlotte Bacon, 6, Daniel Barden, 7, and Victoria ""Vicki"" Soto, 27, held calling hours, or visitations, for their lost loved ones. The teacher and children were among the 27 people killed when gunman Adam Lanza shot his mother and then went to the Sandy Hook, indiscriminately opening fire on staff and young students. The rampage reignited a debate about guns in America and sent shock waves through a nation that has seen mass killings before -- but not like this. ""She had an answer for everything, she didn't miss a trick, and she outsmarted us every time. We called her our little CEO for the way she carefully thought out and planned everything,"" the family of Jessica said about their little girl, who loved horses and asked Santa for a cowgirl hat this year. ""We can not imagine our life without her,"" they said. James liked to remind everyone that he was 6 and three-quarters. ""He would often sing at the top of his lungs, and once asked, 'How old do I have to be to sing on a stage?'"" his family wrote in an obituary. In an online posting about his funeral, the Mattioli family called James ""our beloved prince."" Across town, hearses could be seen traveling along roads with police escorts. Onlookers cried as they drove past. Remembering the victims . For Sandy Hook students, no school until January . Unlike students at other schools who returned Tuesday, Sandy Hook students are not expected to go back until January. Their school is a crime scene. The current plan is for them to resume classes next year at the former Chalk Hill Middle School, eight miles away in neighboring Monroe, Newtown Superintendent of Schools Janet Robinson said in a letter to parents. ""We need to tend to our teachers' and students' needs to feel comfortable after this trauma in this new place,"" she wrote. Teachers may call parents ""to invite you to visit Chalk Hill with your child this week to walk around and see the classroom and get familiar with this new Sandy Hook home."" At other schools, students went back to class with their sense of normalcy shattered. They were met by police, counselors and teachers, who all face a tremendous burden. How do they explain to children what happened? How do they help make them feel safe? David Schonfeld, a crisis counselor who gave a presentation to Newtown teachers about how to talk to students, said they have to meet children where they are. ""I told them that as far as I was concerned, there was really only one lesson plan that they needed to teach before they broke for the (holidays), and that was to make sure that the children knew that they were safe and that they cared about them and they were going to care for them,"" he said. The teachers' union said classes would discuss the tragedy in an age-appropriate manner. The gunman's computer and grim new details . Investigators have so far been unable to retrieve data from a computer taken from the home of the gunman, Adam Lanza, a law enforcement official said Tuesday. It appears Lanza smashed the computer, extensively damaging the hard drive, the official said, adding that the FBI is assisting Connecticut State Police in trying to retrieve data from the computer. Lanza's mother was shot four times in the head while she slept in her bed, said Connecticut Chief Medical Examiner H. Wayne Carver, also Tuesday. Adam Lanza killed himself with a shot to the front of his head from a handgun, the medical examiner said. Toxicology tests are under way to determine whether Adam Lanza had taken medication. Growing debate over gun laws . What happened in Newtown should never happen again, advocates on both sides of the gun-control debate agree. But they're at staunch odds about how to turn words into reality. The National Rifle Association commented Tuesday for the first time since the shooting, saying it was shocked and heartbroken by what happened. The group is planning to hold a news conference on Friday. ""Out of respect for the families, and as a matter of common decency, we have given time for mourning, prayer and a full investigation of the facts before commenting,"" it said. ""The NRA is prepared to offer meaningful contributions to help make sure this never happens again."" The grassroots group Newtown United sent a delegation to Washington to meet with the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence as well as families from July's movie theater massacre in Aurora, Colorado. The new group, which formed out of Newtown on Sunday, aims to create meaningful dialogue -- both locally and beyond -- about what may have led to the tragedy. Until school shooting, 1 homicide in almost a decade . The debate is playing out not just in Newtown and Washington, but across the United States. Two national polls conducted shortly after the Newtown massacre suggest that more Americans want stricter gun control. In a Washington Post/ABC News poll, 54% of adults favor stricter gun control laws in the country, while 43% oppose. And a new CBS News poll indicates that 57% of Americans back stricter gun laws, the highest percentage in a decade; 30% think gun laws should be kept as they are. However, less than half of the respondents in the CBS poll -- 42% -- think stricter gun laws would have helped prevent what happened at Sandy Hook Elementary. Sen. Joe Manchin, a conservative Democrat from West Virginia and a ""proud gun owner,"" said he's now committed to ""dialogue that would bring a total change"" after the massacre in Newtown. ""Who would have ever thought, in America or anywhere in the world, that children would be slaughtered?"" he asked. ""It's changed me."" John Licata told CNN's iReport there needs to be better vetting before people buy guns, and assault weapons should be banned -- something Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, says she'll propose once the new Congress convenes in January. But some say the shooting illustrates the need for more armed guards -- and possibly armed teachers -- in schools. Gun lobby has laid groundwork against any new laws . Texas Gov. Rick Perry said that if school districts decide that arming teachers is the best way to keep schools safe, so be it. If Texas residents are duly background-checked, trained and have a concealed handgun license, ""you should be able to carry your handgun anywhere in the state,"" Perry said, according to CNN affiliate WFAA. Out of respect for the Newtown victims and their families, Dick's Sporting Goods has removed all guns from its store closest to Newtown, the company said. Dick's, one of the largest sporting goods retailers in the world, also has suspended the sale of some semiautomatic rifles nationwide, the company said. It was unclear how long Dick's will keep its suspension of ""modern sporting rifles."" Shedding new light on the gunman . While Carver, the chief medical examiner, said he was told that Adam Lanza had Asperger's syndrome, officials are working to determine whether that diagnosis was correct, and whether he may have had other diagnosable problems. A former director of security for Newtown Public Schools shed new light Monday night on the gunman. Richard Novia said Adam Lanza had Asperger's syndrome, based on documents and conversations with Lanza's mother. Novia said that as part of his job, which he left in 2008, he would be informed of students who might pose problems to themselves or others. He also said he received ""intake information,"" which he said ""is common for any students troubled or impaired or with disabilities."" The idea was to keep track of and help students who may need it. However, Novia said he never thought Lanza was a threat and certainly never thought he was capable of such violence. After shooting, cops take no-tolerance approach to copycat threats . Russ Hanoman, a friend of Lanza's mother, previously told CNN that Lanza had Asperger's and that he was ""very withdrawn emotionally."" CNN has not been able to independently confirm whether Lanza was diagnosed with autism or Asperger's, a higher-functioning form of autism. Both are developmental disorders, not mental illnesses. Many experts say neither Asperger's syndrome nor autism can be blamed for the rampage. ""There is absolutely no evidence or any reliable research that suggests a linkage between autism and planned violence,"" the Autism Society said in a statement. ""To imply or suggest that some linkage exists is wrong and is harmful to more than 1.5 million law-abiding, nonviolent and wonderful individuals who live with autism each day."" Dr. Max Wiznitzer, a pediatric neurologist and autism expert at Rainbow Babies and Children's Hospital in Cleveland, also said the gunman's actions can't be linked to autism spectrum disorders. ""Aggression and violence in the ASD population is reactive, not preplanned and deliberate,"" he said. Gun control: 'This one feels different' CNN's Susan Candiotti reported from Newtown; Dana Ford reported from Atlanta. CNN's Holly Yan, Greg Botelho, Sandra Endo, Josh Levs, Miriam Falco, Wayne Drash, Carol Cratty, Paul Steinhauser and David Williams contributed to this report.","6-year-olds Jessica Rekos and James Mattioli are laid to rest .

"(CNN) -- The University of Connecticut men's basketball team cannot compete for next year's national championship after the NCAA denied the school's appeal of a postseason ban based on its athletes' academic performance. The Huskies earlier had been ordered to sit out the 2013 NCAA tournament, because of its past players' sub-par academic performance rate. Led by longtime coach Jim Calhoun, the program had won that tourney last spring and, thus, captured the national title. The University of Connecticut appealed that ruling, but to no avail, both the school and the NCAA said Thursday. ""It is disturbing that our current players must pay a penalty for the academic performance of students no longer enrolled,"" University of Connecticut President Susan Herbst said in a statement. ""No educator or parent purposefully punishes young people for the failings of others."" The NCAA defended the decision, with spokesman Erik Christianson stating ""schools have known since 2006"" about the ""serious penalties, including postseason restriction"" for programs that did not meet set academic requirements. ""Also, in UConn's first waiver denial, NCAA staff noted the men's basketball team's overall lack of academic achievement and minimal academic progress over several years,"" Christianson said by e-mail to CNN. The move is a result of the NCAA's decision to implement a recommendation, backed by U.S. Education Secretary Arne Duncan and the Knight Commission on Intercollegiate Athletics, to penalize programs that did not or were not on track to graduate at least half of their student athletes. ""If you can't manage to graduate half of your players, how serious is the institution and the coach and the program about their players' academic success?"" Duncan, who played basketball while attending Harvard, told reporters last spring. ""Are you actually preparing your student athletes for success -- is it just on the court or in life?"" The NCAA notes that a 930 APR, or academic performance rate, equates to a program being at the fulcrum to meet that criteria -- with higher scores indicating that a program is on track to graduate more than half its players, and lower ones indicating it is not. The APR score for the UConn men's basketball's team, based on data from the 2009-2010 academic year, was an 893, according to the NCAA's website. That led to the NCAA immediately determining that the Huskies must offer two fewer scholarships, as well as setting the stage for next year's postseason ban. Any university team in an NCAA-sanctioned sport had to ""achieve a 900 multiyear APR or a 930 average over the most recent two years to be eligible"" for postseason play during the 2012-2013 school year, according to Christianson. Because the NCAA is ""still in the waiver process,"" there is no ""exact figure"" yet as to how many other programs will be penalized like Connecticut's men's basketball team, added Christianson. The academic standards will get even more stringent next school year, the spokesman noted. By then, a 930 APR score average will be required over four years, or at least a 940 for the two most recent years, for an interscholastic athletics program to compete in a 2014-2015 postseason tournament. The University of Connecticut said, in its release issued Thursday, that its men's basketball team is well ahead of that requirement. That includes a ""nearly perfect 978"" APR score for the squad that won the national title and a ""perfect APR score"" for the fall 2011 semester. ""While we as a university and coaching staff clearly should have done a better job academically with our men's basketball student athletes in the past, the changes we have implemented have already had a significant impact and have helped us achieve the success we expect in the classroom,"" Calhoun said. This isn't the first blow by the NCAA to the Huskies program, which traditionally has been among the best in its Big East conference and the nation as a whole. In February 2011, the NCAA suspended Calhoun for three conference games, reduced the number of scholarships and mandated recruiting restrictions after determining that team staff members violated rules by exchanging 150 calls and 190 text messages with prospective recruits and providing complimentary game tickets. The NCAA's infractions committee also found that Calhoun knowingly allowed a booster and certified NBA agent to participate in recruitment and make prohibited financial contributions to a potential student athlete. The coach responded that he was ""very disappointed with the NCAA's decision in this case."" A 2005 inductee into the basketball hall of fame, Calhoun has won three NCAA national championships in his career -- including his last 26 seasons with the Huskies -- and ranks sixth all-time with 873 victories, according to the official UConn athletics website. CNN's Greg Botelho contributed to this report.","NEW: The NCAA had noted UConn's ""minimal academic progress,"" a spokesman says .

"(CNN) -- Former South African President Nelson Mandela, at home after a long hospital stay, is alert and playing with his grandchildren, his granddaughter Zaziwe Manaway told CNN exclusively Friday. Mandela, 94, is aware of social media rumors that he's close to death, Manaway said. Read more: Nelson Mandela discharged from the hospital . ""That is absolutely not true. My grandfather is well,"" she said. ""It can be very, very hurtful for us to hear these messages out there in the social media that our grandfather is going to go home to die. It is insensitive."" Mandela is revered in his country, CNN's Robyn Curnow writes, because he reminds South Africans of how far they have come. The former president embodies the South Africa that was promised in the election of 1994, and many South Africans worry that their country no longer reflects the democratic ideals Mandela spent his life advocating. Fast facts about Mandela . Manaway said she wants to appeal to people spreading rumors to stop, and to be more sensitive to the family and to Mandela, a global icon of peace and South Africa's defeat of apartheid. ""My grandfather still wakes up in the morning (and) reads the newspaper,"" the 35-year-old said. ""So he is also aware of what is being said around him."" Mandela was treated for an acute respiratory infection in 2011. He was hospitalized for a lung infection on December 8, and on December 15, he underwent surgery for removal of gallstones. Because Mandela is in his 90s, it's understandable that ""once in a while, he needs medical care and medical attention,"" another granddaughter, 33-year-old Swati Dlamini, told CNN. ""And we're very grateful he's surrounded by the best medical team. He's very well taken care of, and he's very comfortable, and he's very happy."" On Wednesday, a spokesman for South African President Jacob Zuma told media that Mandela had been discharged from the hospital and would continue receiving treatment at his home in Houghton. He's received well wishes from around the globe, his granddaughters said. ""We'd just like to thank the whole world for sending us messages and keeping us in their prayers,"" Manaway said. ""We know that people worry and we know that people are concerned,"" Dlamini said. ""But, you know, we'd just like people to know that he's doing very well and he's in good spirits and he's very cheerful."" Mandela has not made a public appearance since the 2010 World Cup hosted in his country. In 2011, South Africans got a rare glimpse of him when he voted in local municipal elections at his home in Johannesburg. Mandela's life in pictures . There's been secrecy surrounding his health. ""He has every right to his privacy,"" Dlamini said. ""As the family, we call on people and urge people to give us the privacy to deal with whatever we're going through as a family in private."" ""I think people need to remember that my grandfather played a huge role -- and not only him, many other South Africans played a huge role -- to get us where we are now,"" she added. ""My grandfather said this when he was resigning from public life -- it is now (up) to South Africans to take this country forward, that a legacy like his should be carried by as many people as possible."" Dlamini said she is telling her children about their great-grandfather's life. He was the president from 1994 to 1999, making him the first president chosen in a democratic election and the country's first black president. In his younger years, he fought against apartheid and was sentenced to life in prison for his activism. He spent 27 years behind bars and was released in 1990. Mandela was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993. ""He's always dedicated his life to the struggle,"" Dlamini said. ""For our children to be able to spend time with him now ... they can sit on his lap and hear stories from him. It's great; something we didn't have growing up."" On Mandela's birthday in July this year, former U.S. President Bill Clinton reflected on the conversations the two have had. Mandela kept his wife and daughter in mind, Clinton said. ""He didn't call me a single time, not once, when he didn't ask about Hillary (Clinton) and Chelsea,"" Clinton said of their conversations during the time both were in office. ""If it wasn't too late, he'd ask me to go get Chelsea, bring her to the phone, ask about her homework."" Clinton said the anti-apartheid icon never lost touch with his humanity. ""I saw in him something that I try not to lose in myself, which is no matter how much responsibility you have,"" Clinton said, ""he remembered you were a person first.""

"Moscow (CNN) -- The Bolshoi Ballet says the allegations swirling around one of its dancers -- that he choreographed an attack to blind the artistic director -- are ""absurd."" Even an alleged confession in the case does nothing to convince the cast and crew that Pavel Dmitrichenko could be behind the attack that severely burned and nearly blinded Sergei Filin, the Bolshoi employees said in an open letter Wednesday. ""Unfortunately, the history of our country and our society knows many examples"" when results were achieved by ""illegal methods, and evidence and proof often turned out to be a fiction,"" the letter said. The group called for an independent commission to probe the attack. Moscow police struck back, saying its ""investigators do their job honestly."" Ballet 'villain' arrested: Story in 4 Acts . The plot laid out by authorities pits Dmitrichenko as the central villain, lashing out against Filin -- a man who often cast Dmitrichencko as the villain in productions. What neither side disputes: Someone threw sulfuric acid into Filin's face in January as he entered his Moscow apartment. Police say Dmitrichenko had two co-conspirators, one of whom threw the acid. Local newspapers had quoted ballet members as saying Dmitrichenko was angry because he thought Filin was stifling the career of Anzhelina Vorontsova -- Dmitrichenko's girlfriend. ""For everyone who knows Pavel Dmitrichenko, even the idea that he could be the mastermind and the customer of the crime committed in such a brutal form, is absurd,"" the Bolshoi's cast and crew said in their letter. ""Having known Pavel personally for many years, we are convinced that despite his notorious temper, his hot-headedness and his straightforwardness, he is a very decent and sympathetic person who is always ready to extend a helping hand."" The members added they are convinced ""that the fundamental disagreements with Sergei Filin about his artistic and personnel policy in the ballet could not go beyond the law. We believe that the investigation's findings are too rushed, the evidence seems unconvincing and we view Pavel's testimony, which was later changed, as given under pressure."" Dmitrichenko and his two alleged accomplices are being held until the police investigation is over. It may take at least six months for Filin to recover from the burns. Doctors performed a skin graft on him, and, after a second eye surgery, were able to save his sight. Filin is ""coming through the toughest period of his life,"" the ballet said. ""We hope that the true reasons and circumstances of this crime would be established."" Police said the investigation is still ongoing, and preliminary results will be reported to the ballet and to the public. Last week, police declared their case was solved with Dmitrichenko's confession. ""I organized this attack but not to the extent that it happened,"" the dancer is heard saying in a video released by police. Russia's RIA Novosti news agency reported that before the attack, Filin suffered months of intimidation, including threatening phone calls, someone slashing his tires, and someone attempting to hack his Facebook page. CNN's Alla Eshchenko reported from Moscow; CNN's Josh Levs reported from Atlanta.

"(CNN) -- Libya today is a free Libya, but also a Libya plagued by a sad and violent history, a Libya that has not been able to progress for 42 years. Basic education, health care and infrastructure are integral to Libya's success and its future. But art and culture can be and should be a huge part of the healing process as well as future development. By integrating art and culture into the core efforts at transition from Moammar Gadhafi's ruinous rule, we can transcend part of the trauma of war and violence and create a distinct national identity, free of speculation as to old tribal or political allegiances and accepting of the whole of Libyan society. The ruins of Leptis Magna, Sabrata, Cyrene (also called Shahhat) and all the other incredible remnants of Libya's rich history can be an example of the glory of Libya's past -- but also its hope for the future. Libya's possibilities are often measured by way of its abundant natural resources, but the revolution this past year has put in perspective Libya's truest and greatest assets: the courageous Libyan people, their rich multifaceted culture, and the ideals with which they wish to make their place in this world, challenging power that at times has seemed absolute. This was what my father and family tried to articulate to me as a child, growing up in exile. Libyan culture has a long and storied history, dating back to ancient times, influenced by a variety of traditions and peoples who have made their way across the deserts of Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and Fezzan. The majestic ruins that run along the coastline are testament to this history. As I arrived to these sites, seeing the monuments of the Roman and ancient Greek civilizations beside the Mediterranean, I was struck by the ageless beauty of Sabratha, Leptis Magna and Cyrene. But as an art world professional, I was also struck by the lack of preservation surrounding the ruins. Global Heritage Fund is a nonprofit organization that works to preserve cultural sites around the world. GHF projects in Cyrene and Apollonia have stalled as a result of the revolution, but the group has renewed its efforts with the new Libya. GHF has done its utmost to involve Libyans. Students from the universities of Benghazi and Baida were and will be involved in the conservation efforts in the framework of their archaeology management studies. I've recently been appointed to help GHF set up its Libyan Heritage Trust. We hope that as Libya prospers and grows, the government will recognize the importance of these sites, as a possible boon to the tourism industry but also as a source of economic diversification and patriotic reconciliation. I began working in the art world in 2005 after completing my education at Brown University and the London School of Economics, and my first full-time job was really because of Libya. I worked as a project coordinator for renowned artists Ilya and Emilia Kabakov's Ship of Siwa, a nonprofit project that brings international artists to Siwa, Egypt, to interact with the local population and produce ephemeral work that is more about creating an experience than an object. Siwa is a mystical desert oasis, possibly home to Alexander the Great's lost army and Cleopatra's healing waters. Its proximity to the Libyan border was a huge draw to me. As my family was not allowed to go back to Libya, the closest I had been to Libya at that point was Cairo, so being able to see the rolling dunes crisscrossing the border was an opportunity I couldn't pass up. In the end, it was a serendipitous event for me, as I fell in love with the art world and I have since devoted my time, both personal and professional, to helping the development and evolution of arts in the Middle East. I hope that Libya's development will usher in new forms of expression, and I look forward to seeing how that newfound expression will find its place in the visual arts. I anticipate celebrating contemporary art alongside the ancient monuments and illustrating that Libya can show its maturity, but also its innovation and creativity. Although suffering from a severe deficit of social and physical infrastructure, Libya today is free from tyrannical rule. Its people have the opportunity to design a fit-for-purpose political system, which takes into account Libya's diverse peoples, tribes and cultures, creating a unique national identity. All Libyans can be proud of Leptis Magna. All Libyans can be proud of their cultural heritage. And through concerted efforts to integrate arts education in to schools and everyday life and preserve these historical sites, this can indeed be a reality. Join us on Facebook/CNNOpinion .

"Cairo (CNN) -- A leading figure in the Sunni Islam world called for fellow believers to respond to recent controversial portrayals of Mohammed -- which he said ""spread hatred"" -- just like the prophet himself would, ""through patience and wisdom."" The Grand Mufti of Egypt Ali Gomaa spoke to CNN as Muslims staged yet more passionate protests Saturday in yet more locales, from Germany to Lebanon to Bangladesh, as they have since September 11. Demonstrators railed against an obscure, 14-minute trailer for a film that mocks Mohammed as a womanizer, child molester and killer -- as well as the country in which it was privately produced, the United States -- and more recently a French satirical magazine's cartoons of a figure representing Mohammed. Egypt's grand mufti questioned whether in the United States, for example, the inflammatory film ""Innocence of Muslims"" was not illegal under laws prohibiting the spread of hatred. And he also challenged if laws protecting freedom of speech were applicable. ""This is not freedom of speech, this is an attack on humanity, (an) attack on religions, and (an) attack on human rights,"" he said. At the same time, the North African nation's grand mufti -- a figure appointed by Egypt's government whose pronouncements often hold significant sway in the Muslim world -- stressed conflict is not the answer, saying, ""We live together and must respect our neighbors."" ""These cartoons spread hatred, and we call for peace,"" he said, adding that Islamic leaders ""fear the spread of hatred"" against their religion and oppose ""the mocking"" of any religion. Noting Egypt-based Coptic Church bishops had condemned the film that sparked protests, Egypt's grand mufti -- who noted he's active in the Coexist Foundation, which promotes religious tolerance -- urged an end to the cycle of different groups attacking each other. And in Egypt, at least, he vowed Muslims and Christians will continue to peacefully coexist despite the recent turmoil. ""My message to those who want (strife) between Muslims and Christians in Egypt, I tell them, 'You will not succeed, because we are one people that have been living together for more than 1,400 years,'"" he said. More Muslims protest inflammatory film, cartoons . The trailer for ""Innocence of Muslims"" was posted online to YouTube in July, but it wasn't until earlier this month that it gained attention in the Muslim world and stirred tens of thousands of protest in more than 20 nations. While most of these demonstrations have been peaceful, a number have been marred by violence that has left more than two dozen people dead -- among them U.S. Ambassador to Libya Chris Stevens and three other Americans killed in an attack on the consulate in Benghazi, Libya. And there were more protests Saturday, in which Muslims once again derided the film and, in many cases, the United States. Among them: . -- Thousands of Shiite Muslims protested in the Nigerian city of Kano, with the crowd shouting ""God is great"" and ""Death to America,"" resident Sani isa Mohammed told CNN. There were no immediate reports of violence, according to a police officer said. ""The imam called us to join in the call to damn the evil film from America which insulted the prophet and we joined in the march,"" Mohammed said. ""We chanted and shouted. My voice is hoarse from screaming!"" -- Protests in Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, turned violent as police fired tear gas and used clubs to disperse the crowd, which included some wielding sticks and flinging chunks of bricks, police and witnesses said. Demonstrators in the South Asian nation -- which has one of the world's largest Muslim populations -- torched a police van and damaged police cars, and several protesters and protest leaders were arrested, the spokesman said. Activists called a countrywide general strike for Sunday in protest of a government ban issued Friday on any kind of gatherings and rallies in downtown Purana Paltan, centering the national mosque. Benazir Ahmed, chief of the Dhaka Metropolitan Police, defended a ban that he said was imposed to maintain law and order. -- Hundreds took to the streets of Dortmund, Germany, chanting and peacefully denouncing what they described as injustices against Islam. One banner, for instance, noted that insulting blacks, Jews or women would be defined as racism, anti-Semitism and sexism, respectively, but questioned why insulting the Muslim Prophet would qualify as freedom of opinion. -- Thousands carrying Lebanese and Hezbollah flags turned out in Bint Jbeil, in southeastern Lebanon. Prompted by speakers, they chanted anti-American slogans and derided any attempt to defame the Prophet Mohammed. Druze and Christian leaders in the area joined top Muslim figures at the demonstration. -- A day after at least 27 people were killed and more than 100 injured as mobs ransacked banks, theaters, government offices and a church and clashed with security forces, at least 3,500 female students of Islamabad's Lal Masjid, or Red Mosque, protested the film . The women and girls wore headbands on top of their burqas as they marched through Islamabad's streets, carrying placards saying ""America is the biggest terrorist"" and ""Say NO to American products,"" mosque spokesman Abdul Qadir told CNN. ""We will respond to this insult whether we are men or women,"" they chanted. American diplomatic official summoned in Pakistan . Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, meanwhile, summoned U.S. charges d'affaires Ambassador Richard Hoagland on Friday to demand the United States remove the controversial movie from YouTube. Islamabad -- which had declared a ""national holiday"" to protest the film -- has blocked the site in recent days. According to a statement, the ministry lodged a protest with Hoagland over the movie, describing it as ""a premeditated and a malicious act to spread hatred and violence among people of different faiths."" Hoagland reiterated the Obama administration's repeated condemnation of the movie and its message, emphasizing that the United States government had nothing to do with it. ""Ambassador Hoagland stated that this act was a deeply insensitive decision by a single individual to disseminate hatred,"" according to a statement released by the U.S. Embassy. ""It does not reflect the values of the United States, a nation of more than 300 million people, built upon the pillars of religious freedom and tolerance."" The U.S. mission in Lahore, Pakistan, on Saturday extended the temporary suspension of services amid news of two planned protests that were expected to draw hundreds, according to a U.S. State Department security announcement. Washington launches TV, social media campaign . The United States has been trying to stem anger in Pakistan through television advertisements and a Facebook campaign. The U.S. State Department spent $70,000 on television public service announcements that began airing last week in Pakistan. The ads feature Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton disavowing the anti-Islam video. On the Facebook page of the U.S. Embassy in Islamabad, officials posted a video of two Americans speaking out against the film, but that has drawn overwhelmingly negative responses. ""If America (does) not have any concern with this film then why (is) their government not taking any action against this act? Why there is no law (to) protect the religious (beliefs) of Muslims?"" read a Facebook post by someone identified as Numra Sheikh. CNN's Yousuf Basil, Shaan Khan, Reza Sayah and Chelsea J.

"(CNN) -- Cyprus has become the latest eurozone nation to apply for a bailout amid a financial crisis linked to debt defaults in Greece. The Mediterranean island has a huge banking sector and its public debt is expected to match GDP within the next decade. Proposals to tax existing bank deposits as part of a rescue package have alarmed investors. The Cypriot parliament on Tuesday rejected a €10 billion eurozone bailout package due to investor alarm over a proposed tax on existing bank deposits as part of the rescue package. Why is Cyprus facing financial problems? In a March 16 statement on the agreement, the Eurogroup -- an informal body of eurozone finance ministers -- said the ""current fragile situation of the Cypriot financial sector"" was linked to its large size relative to the country's GDP. Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem said Cyprus' banking sector was more than five times the size of GDP and the group predicted that the island's public debt would reach 100% of GDP in 2020. Cyprus' finance ministry said it needed €10 billion ($130,000) ""to cover fiscal needs, the restructuring of the banking system and for the support of the economy in general."" Are Cyprus' issues related to the financial crisis in Greece? We need look no further than the streets of Athens to understand how Cyprus ended up in its current position, according to CNN's Jim Boulden. When a struggling Greece was allowed to let some of its private bond holders take a loss -- a ""haircut"" -- Cypriot banks lost money and needed refinancing. So the big financial institutions like the Bank of Cyprus asked for a bailout from the government, and the government came to the EU in June 2012 saying it needed a bailout in turn. Talks have dragged since then, as Cyprus resisted many of the tough economic measures demanded by potential institutional lenders in return for bailout funds. Boulden said one sticking point was whether Cyprus would have to raise its corporate tax from the EU's lowest of 10% to 12.5% -- equal to Ireland. Read more: Cyprus bailout threatens to backfire . What's being proposed in Cyprus? Cyprus is trying to get a €10 billion eurozone bailout. Under the original Eurogroup proposal on March 16, all holders of bank accounts in Cyprus -- both residents and non-residents -- would have been required to pay a one-off tax on their existing deposits. Account holders with more than €100,000 ($130,000) would have paid a 9.9% levy and those with smaller deposits 6.75%. However, discussions around the specifics of the deal appear to be ongoing. The money would be used to prop up Cypriot banks that were badly exposed to the financial crisis in Greece. The Financial Times reported that the depositor levy was demanded by a German-led group of creditor countries to bring down the bailout's price tag from €17 billion ($22B). Cyprus' ministry of finance said in a statement that ""without the levy, the sovereign debt would have undoubtedly been non-sustainable."" A government spokesman later said Cyprus' president had ""fought hard"" to exclude deposits of under €100,000 from the levy ""which was imposed in order to blackmail Cyprus by those who are today trying to justify their own decisions."" On March 19, Agence France-Presse quoted French Finance Minister Pierre Moscovici as saying the eurozone had agreed to scrap the levy on deposits of less than €100,000. British Chancellor George Osborne told the BBC on March 17 that the UK government would compensate any of its military or civil servants serving in Cyprus affected by the levy. Will the proposal go through? On Tuesday, the Cypriot parliament soundly rejected a €10 billion bailout offer from the European Union because of public outcry over the proposed tax on bank deposits. In trying to convince Cypriots to support the EU deal, President Nicos Anastasiades warned that the alternative --- bankruptcy, exit from the euro and devaluation -- would be even more painful. After the vote, Germany's finance minister said that European officials were disappointed. ""Cyprus has a banking sector that is way too big and they are insolvent with that model and no one outside of Cyprus is at fault for that,"" Wolfgang Schaeuble said on German public broadcaster, ZDF. Read More: Cyprus rejects bank levy, bailout in doubt . Anastasiades and the leaders of Cyprus' political parties will now meet on Wednesday to try to hash out an alternative plan, but they'll have to come up with a workable solution quickly. Banks are due to open Thursday for the first time this week and the chance of a run on deposits is high. Read more: Five reasons bailout matters . Will any deal a precedent for other European countries? CNNMoney said developments are being closely watched because of the potential to destabilize financial markets in Europe; there are also concerns that other financially weak nations might fear similar bailout provisions in the future. ""The question is whether this becomes a full-blown crisis or a mini-crisis,"" Steven Englander, global head of foreign exchange strategy at Citi told CNNMoney. ""Depositors and investors elsewhere could easily see this as another in a string of 'one-offs' and react badly."" Has such a tax been imposed anywhere before? It is the first time in the EU. In 2001, the IMF released a report on bank debit taxes that had been imposed in Latin America -- however, these taxes were on financial transactions not an outright grab as is being proposed in Cyprus. Read more: How to turn a drama into a crisis . Won't this cause a run on banks? At least 35 banks from around the world have branches in Cyprus, according to the country's central bank. Cyprus' parliament needs to approve the deal but Cypriots rushed to withdraw their savings from bank ATMs after news of the plan. CNN's Isa Soares said some banks were already refusing to release cash or putting limits on withdrawals. Cyprus has extended its Monday bank holiday until Thursday. Writing for CNNMoney, Brookings Institution fellow Douglas J. Elliot said there was a ""grave risk"" that the bank levy would ""eventually lead to serious bank runs in other parts of the eurozone."" What will happen if a revised deal doesn't go through? In an address to the nation on March 17, President Nicos Anastasiades said the bailout option was ""very difficult"" but one that would eventually lead to economic recovery in Cyprus. He said failure to agree to the package would ""lead to disorderly bankruptcy as a result of the decision of the European Central Bank to immediately discontinue the provision of emergency assistance to preserve the liquidity of the two large banks."" This would have meant depositors would have lost access to their deposits, and a large number would have faced significant losses, he said. This would mean depositors will lose access to their deposits, and a large number will face significant losses, he said. Watch: Opposition leader talks to Quest on bailout plan . What's Russia's involvement? Nearly a third of the money in Cyprus' banks is Russian, CNNMoney reported. It said a 10% corporate tax -- half that of Russia's -- meant Russian firms had been using it as a tax haven since the early 1990s. The top proposed levy could result in a $3 billion loss for Russian citizens. President Vladimir Putin described the tax as an ""unfair, unprofessional and dangerous step."" CNN's Ratlisa Vassileva said Russia's government was angry not to have been consulted on the proposal and its finance minister had said the issue would factor in any decision the country made on restructuring its multi-billion dollar loan to Cyprus. Cyprus' finance minister was due to meet his Russian counterpart later Wednesday.","Cyprus' president has agreed to an EU rescue package that would see bank deposits taxed .

"Sydney (CNN) -- It was, until today, something that happened to sporting codes elsewhere, never in Australia. As a result, the finding of widespread use of banned drugs across professional sports by elite athletes has shocked the Australian sporting world. The Australian Crime Commission's year long investigation also found links between drug use and organized crime and at least one instance of possible match-fixing. ""It's cheating, but it's worse than that. It's cheating with the help of criminals,"" Australian Justice Minister Jason Clare told a media conference in Canberra attended by the heads of many of the countries' major sporting codes. The probe uncovered the use of banned drugs, including peptides and a number of others drugs, some of which have as yet not been tested for humans. Worse, they have been used, according to the ACC report, in orchestrated doping programs facilitated by coaches, sports scientists, support staff, doctors and pharmacists. It is this that most shocks Australian Broadcasting Corporation sports commentator Peter Wilkins. ""Sports people are always pushing the envelope. Everyone does that,"" Wilkins told CNN. ""So if you find a drug and it's not on the banned list you will give it a go,"" he said. But that entire teams of elite athletes may be systematically using illegal substances to enhance their performance with the knowledge and help of sports scientists, coaches and doctors, leaves Wilkins astounded. ""The sports scientists and sports teams which are potentially doping, that's shocking,"" said Wilkins. ""But are they going to go down?"" he asks. Tip of the iceberg . All of this comes in the same week that the Essendon Football Club in Victoria approached the Australian Football League (AFL) and Australian Sports Anti-Doping Authority (ASADA) to investigate claims that its players took substances that may be illegal. Shocking though the claim was, it may turn out to be the tip of the iceberg in a nation which prides itself on being at the forefront of clean sport. The substances the Essendon Football Club believes its players may have used are believed to include peptide or related substances that were injected. Some peptides are legal for athletes to inject. The investigation is expected to focus on whether the illegal substances the club believes its players used was inert peptide, or otherwise, and whether the drugs were administered as part of a fitness regime. Players could face season suspensions, though legendary AFL coach Kevin Sheedy said after the ACC findings were released that suspension might not be enough. ""We need to get rid of it -- we need to find the people and eradicate them from the sport,"" he told local reporters. Though the ACC has not named specific athletes or clubs that are under current investigation, the National Rugby League (NRL) says more than one of its players and more than one of its clubs are under investigation. The code has already committed to an audit and register of people supplying performance services to its players and clubs, as well as centralized testing for illicit substances. Integrity units . All sporting codes have expressed shock at the findings as they pledged full co-operation with ASADA and other investigating authorities. The AFL, the NRL, the Football Federation of Australia, Australian Rugby Union and Cricket Australia have agreed to establish integrity units and have called on athletes to own up and co-operate in return for reduced sanctions. Wilkins said he was surprised that the findings were made public while active investigations are ongoing. ""There are still a lot of qualifiers,"" added Wilkins. But according to Richard Ings, the former chief of the ASADA, the report's findings are no surprise. He said the involvement of criminal networks was well known to the anti-doping agency. ""Having worked with ASADA for the past five years it was very clear that there were links between elements of organized crime importing and distributing prohibited substances across Australian sport,"" Ings told CNN. Nor was AFL chief Andrew Demetriou surprised by the links between the supply of drugs and organized crime. ""Organized crime is very pervasive,"" he told the Canberra media conference. ""They find vulnerable players. They infiltrate,"" said the AFL chief. ""And all of us here today would say that today is the day we draw a line in the sand. We address it, we tackle it. Sport is too important in this community."" But Demetriou denied that Essendon Football Club went to the authorities with its illicit drug taking suspicions as a result of the ACC investigation. The ACC's report draws on past international cases to warn of a potential link between the involvement of crime gangs in sport and match-fixing. ""Overseas experience has demonstrated that organized criminal groups involved in match-fixing are increasingly targeting sub-elite athletes due to the ease with which these individuals can be 'bought', the lower levels of scrutiny from integrity authorities at sub-elite competitions, and the potential long-term value of these athletes to the criminal group,"" it said. President of the World Anti-Doping Agency John Fahey said that it's not surprising that the problem has surfaced in Australia. ""It is very clear from Interpol and we have a close association with them in WADA, that the suppliers, manufacturers, traffickers of the performance enhancing drugs are the same people who are connected with the illegal drugs, the same people who are connected with match-fixing and illegal gambling so I guess it's not surprising that it now surfaces in this country,"" Fahey told ABC radio. Sports betting . The Deputy Victorian Police Commissioner, Graham Ashton, said soccer, cricket and tennis were most at risk of match-fixing by organized criminals because they attracted big offshore bets. ""The increasing betting pools mean that we need to take preventative action now to make these sports more resilient to this threat,"" he told reporters. Former South African national Rugby Union coach, Jake White, now a mentor for the ACT Brumbies, thinks it would be difficult to fix a match in rugby. 'The one thing that's magnificent about rugby union is that it's such a difficult game to even think about match -ixing,'' White told The Age newspaper in Melbourne. ''In other games when the margins are nil-nil results, or a team concedes one goal ... rugby is such a fluid and dynamic game that it would stick out like a sore thumb if you even try to do something that's match-fixing,"" he said. An Independent Senator in the Australian Parliament, Nick Xenophon, wants an immediate suspension of all sports betting until all investigations are complete. ""These extraordinary findings require an urgent response to protect the integrity of sporting codes that millions of Australians love,"" Senator Xenophon said.","Australian sports chief to establish ""integrity units"" over doping report .

"(CNN) -- The scourge of racism within football has reared its head once again, with Inter Milan charged by UEFA over ""racist behavior"" of its supporters during last week's Europe League contest against Tottenham Hotspur. The Italian club has also been charged with ""insufficient organization"" and ""throwing of missiles and/or fireworks."" Inter supporters are alleged to have taunted the English team's Togolese striker Emmanuel Adebayor and other black players with monkey chants -- actions which were reported to European soccer's ruling body by the match delegate. The case will be heard on April 19. Inter won the match 4-1 but was eliminated from Europe's second-tier competition on the away goals rule with the aggregate score tied at 4-4. Last month, Inter was fined $65,500 by the Italian football authorities after its fans were found guilty of racially abusing former players Mario Balotelli and Sulley Muntari, who now play for rival AC Milan. The club was also fined $22,700 after fans sang racist chants about Balotelli during a Serie A game against Chievo. Fellow Italian club Lazio was hit with a $52,000 fine last month by UEFA for several offenses, including a fourth charge of racist behavior this season. Lazio had already been fined a total of $230,000 for racist abuse and other fan offenses during two group-stage matches with Tottenham and another against Slovenia's Maribor. In January, the president of football's world governing body FIFA insisted that a more hard-line approach should be taken in dealing with racism. Sepp Blatter advocated punishments such as point deductions and relegation for clubs found guilty. ""It is not enough to give a fine,"" he told FIFA's website. ""Playing a game without spectators is one of the possible sanctions, but the best would be the deduction of points and the relegation of a team, because finally the club is responsible for their spectators."" Since AC Milan forward Kevin-Prince Boateng walked off the pitch in a friendly match in January following racist abuse, both FIFA and UEFA have faced criticism over their reactions to such incidents. Blatter's stance has changed in recent months given that just two years ago he said racism did not exist in football and that any problems could be solved with a handshake. But the 77-year-old, who has spent the past 15 years in charge of FIFA, has changed his view following a number of recent unsavory incidents. He will be meeting Boateng at FIFA headquarters in Zurich this Friday to discuss the problem of racism in football. ""It is a phenomena where football is a victim of our society,"" Blatter said in January. ""Discrimination and racism is everywhere in our society. We in football cannot be made responsible for what happens in our society. ""It is now up to us to take the adequate steps. What I feel we should do is give instructions to our national associations and the confederations -- specifically to the disciplinary committees -- to be very strong.""","Inter Milan charged with ""racist behavior"" by European soccer's ruling body .

"London (CNN) -- Only two days after Pope Francis was officially inaugurated, the Church of England enthroned its new leader, ex-oil executive Justin Welby. As Archbishop of Canterbury, Welby now heads the 77 million-strong worldwide Anglican Communion. British Prime Minister David Cameron, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall, bishops and leaders of other faiths were among those gathered for the ceremony at historic Canterbury Cathedral, about 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of London. It followed a series of time-honored traditions, beginning with the admittance of the new Archbishop of Canterbury into the cathedral following three knocks with his staff on the door. Welby then swore an oath of faith to the Church of England and Queen Elizabeth II on the ancient Canterbury Gospels, brought to England by St. Augustine in 597. But the service also embraced elements that were modern and reflected the church's international reach. A woman, Sheila Anne Watson, the Archdeacon of Canterbury, installed Welby in his role as Bishop of the See of Canterbury. And the cathedral rang with African music and dance, reflecting Welby's link to the continent through his work in peace and reconciliation there, and improvised organ music. In his sermon, Welby said that ""Christ-liberated courage"" had allowed great changes to take place in the past -- such as bringing an end to slavery. Further courage is now needed to tackle issues including the environment, the economy, global poverty and human development, he said. He also reflected on how Pope Francis, in his own inaugural homily on Tuesday, had called for people ""in humility and simplicity"" to protect each other and the world. Thursday's service makes Welby the 105th holder of the most senior position in the Church of England and the titular leader of the world's 77 million Anglicans. He was named as the successor to Dr. Rowan Williams as Archbishop of Canterbury in November. He was the Bishop of Durham, England, at the time. He is considered an outspoken critic of the excesses of capitalism and a supporter of women bishops, as well as an opponent of same-sex marriage. Same-sex marriage . Ahead of the service, the question of same-sex marriage jumped to the fore when an interview Welby gave to the BBC reignited the debate over the church's approach to issues of sexuality. Welby acknowledged the strength of some same-sex partnerships, saying, ""You see gay relationships that are just stunning in the quality of the relationship."" Nonetheless, he reaffirmed his support for the Church of England's policy of opposition to same-sex marriage. ""The Church of England holds very firmly, and continues to hold, to the view that marriage is a lifelong union of one man to one woman,"" he told the British public service broadcaster. ""At the same time, at the heart of our understanding of what it is to be human is the essential dignity of the human being. And so we have to be very clear about homophobia."" Welby said it was not about ""turning a blind eye"" to same-sex relationships but rather ""loving people as they are and where they are."" His remarks come a day after it emerged that Pope Francis, now head of the world's 1.2 billion Catholics, may privately have voiced support for civil unions in his native Argentina while publicly opposing same-sex marriage. Gay rights activist Marcelo Marquez -- a self-described devout Catholic and former theology professor at a Catholic seminary -- said the then-archbishop of Buenos Aires had called him after he wrote an angry letter to Catholic leaders. ""He told me ... 'I'm in favor of gay rights and in any case, I also favor civil unions for homosexuals, but I believe that Argentina is not yet ready for a gay marriage law,'"" said Marquez. Argentina approved a law legalizing same-sex marriage nationwide in July 2010. A bill that would legalize same-sex marriage is currently under consideration in the British Parliament. Cameron has incurred the wrath of many in his Conservative Party by backing the legislation. Educated at Cambridge University, Welby worked for oil companies in Paris and London before training for the ministry. He had only been a bishop for a year before his promotion to the top job was announced. In his public appearances, he has displayed a wry humor and down-to-earth attitude that may help him negotiate the minefield of conflicting views and interests within the vast Anglican Communion.","NEW: Justin Welby is enthroned as the new Archbishop of Canterbury .

"(CNN) -- There are not many places where Rafael Nadal can escape. As one of the world's most high-profile athletes, his every move is under scrutiny -- especially now after his withdrawal from the London 2012 Olympics and this month's U.S. Open has created widespread speculation about his future as a force in tennis. He's one of the most intense men to step foot on a court, and his aggressive, muscular style has contributed to the injuries that have blighted his career in recent years, meaning he has required long periods of recuperation. So where does the Spaniard go when he wants to get away from it all and recover from his punishing schedule? An island paradise he calls home. ""What Mallorca gives Rafael is tranquility,"" the 26-year-old's coach and uncle Toni Nadal told CNN. ""He feels comfortable here. The Mallorcan character is very familiar, not only our family, but most of the Mallorcan families. ""Apart from being very familiar, we are people who normally love our homeland. We all feel very comfortable here, no? Therefore, for Rafael it's normal. He's got his friends here, his family, his birthplace, he's always had a good grounding."" Tennis rivals fear for injured Nadal's future . While many sports stars move to glamorous tax havens such as Monaco, Nadal chooses to stay close to his roots -- and the beautiful Balearic island has its attractions. From Claudia Schiffer to Boris Becker and even the King of Spain himself, it has played host to the rich and famous for many years. Located just off the coast of Spain in the western Mediterranean, about 209 kilometers south of Barcelona and 241 km east of Valencia, Mallorca is the largest of a group of islands including Ibiza, Menorca and Formentera. With its idyllic mountains, golden beaches and fertile strips of green, it is little wonder that one of tennis' most successful men has remained in his home city rather than move abroad. ""It's true that there are many people that when they've traveled, when they've had some success, it's normal for them to change the place they live,"" said Toni Nadal, who has coached Rafa since he was a small boy. ""Here in Mallorca it is less normal, because people here feels very attached to our homeland. I think that's the reason why Rafael is still here. First because he loves Mallorca, he loves the sea, he likes being close to the family and his lifelong friends. That's what I think is stopping him from going to other places."" Injury forces Nadal out of U.S. Open . There's also the fact that the 11-time grand slam champion, who won a record seventh French Open title in June, does not actually enjoy all the publicity he receives. ""You know, I am shy,"" Nadal told CNN's Open Court just days after pulling out of the Olympics due to his ongoing knee problems. ""I am a little less shy than I was a few years ago. That is something that is difficult to lose, but it is something that happens very often for me. ""I think I have learned a lot the last couple of years and I am able to relax a little bit more when I am with people. I enjoy it a little bit more than a few years ago, because I have a little bit more experience, and I have been in the same situation for a lot of times."" For some, the whirlwind rise to stardom may have proved difficult to adapt to with constant television coverage, sponsorship deals and attention coming from all directions. Although he is still adapting to the limelight, Nadal said he has come to terms with his position and the benefits it has brought. Nadal forced to withdraw from London Olympics . ""I am a very lucky guy about what has happened to me. So I cannot pretend to have everything that I have and not have a camera there or not have attention there,"" he said. ""I really feel comfortable with that. I feel very lucky. Seriously, when I am here at home I really don't have attention on me. I am a really normal guy and that's very important to me."" Nadal remains one of the most down to earth sportsmen in the public eye and his desire to escape attention by staying in Mallorca and remaining with friends and family is somewhat of an anomaly. Those relationships have helped him to remain focused on his tennis and escape the pitfalls that fame often brings. ""I always like to do the things that I think are right,"" he said. ""I am not trying to be a model, I am trying to be myself and do the right things. ""If what I am doing is a model, or is an example, is the right example, I am very happy, but I don't pretend that."" The 100th-ranked player who defeated Nadal . Since suffering a second-round shock defeat at Wimbledon against the world number 100 Lukas Rosol, Nadal has been suffering with a recurrence of his injuries. While the world No. 3 will be resting the tendonitis in his left knee, his rivals will be competing for glory at Flushing Meadows. Having missed much of the 2009 season with a similar injury, this latest setback has been all too familiar. Nadal's disappointment at missing the Olympics was exacerbated by the fact he had to relinquish his role as the Spanish flagbearer at the opening ceremony. And while Nadal's presence will be sorely missed in New York, his uncle remains philosophical about his nephew's future. ""I said to him that life had treated him well enough to accept this disappointment,"" explained Toni. ""I said that he's seen himself in worse situations, worse situations of injury. It's a disappointment, but it's not the end of the world.""","Rafael Nadal has shunned the chance to leave his island home of Mallorca .

"Mexico City, Mexico (CNN) -- State and federal authorities in Mexico traded barbs over the escape of 141 inmates from a border city prison as police stepped up security and searched for convicts on the run. The inmates -- apparently in collusion with prison workers -- escaped through a service entrance for staff vehicles, according to information from a preliminary state investigation presented to reporters Friday. The prison director also ""disappeared,"" said Antonio Garza Garcia, public safety secretary for Tamaulipas state. After state authorities divulged the massive escape at the Executions of Sanctions Center, Mexico's interior ministry slammed local officials in Nuevo Laredo, Mexico. ""It is deplorable, the absence of effective measures of control and guarding on the part of local authorities, which has allowed frequent escapes from prisons, putting community security at risk,"" the ministry said in a statement. Garza fired back, arguing that state officials had repeatedly asked the federal government for help guarding prisons, which often house federal prisoners serving time for their connection with drug gangs. ""The state does not have the capacity to stop their escape, which is why we have insisted on the support of the federal government to guarantee that they would be well guarded and thus avoid massive escapes,"" a statement from Antonio Garza Garcia's office said. Earlier this year there were at least two other high-profile prison escapes in Tamaulipas, which borders Texas. In September, 85 inmates used a ladder to clear a wall and escape from a prison in the border city of Reynosa, state media reported. In March, 40 inmates escaped from another prison in the border city of Matamoros. On Friday, Garza told reporters that the escape was reported after guards took roll call around 7 p.m. Thursday. ""We will have no restriction on punishing whoever has to be punished,"" Garza said, according to the state-run Notimex news agency. ""We are going to act with the full weight of the law."" At least 58 of the prisoners who escaped Friday were federal inmates, he said. About 1,700 federal inmates are in prisons statewide, Garza said. Security at eight other penitentiaries has been tightened, he told Radio Formula. Tamaulipas has been a battleground in a bloody turf war between the Zetas gang and the Gulf cartel, but authorities did not indicate Friday whether drug gangs were involved in the escape. CNN's Ariel Crespo contributed to this report.","Federal officials say local authorities' handling of the prisons is ""deplorable""

"New York (CNN) -- Concealed weapon? Check. Concealed identity? Check. New York residents who hold pistol permits can now ask to have their names removed from public records -- an option included in the gun-control law passed after the December massacre at a school in neighboring Connecticut. Forms allowing handgun owners to request that their personal information be kept private are now posted on the New York State Police website. If approved, owners' names, addresses and permit numbers would be withheld from the public record and exempted from the state Freedom of Information Law. Opinion: If you back gun reform, write a check . Handgun owners will have to provide a reason for why they want their personal information withheld, particularly why their life or safety may be endangered or how they may be subjected to unwarranted harassment by the disclosure of their information. Law enforcement agencies would still have access to the records, but the general public wouldn't, State Police Sgt. James Sherman said. But ""unless someone is lying on the form or has misrepresented their information in some way, their request will be granted,"" Sherman said. New York requires a permit to carry a concealed weapon or to keep a pistol in the home, and the exemption applies to both types of licenses. The privacy measure was part of the New York Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, which bans ammunition magazines that hold more than seven rounds and requires instant background checks for all ammunition purchases. Opinion: Obama needs a 'Plan B' on guns . It became law after The Journal News, a suburban New York newspaper, published an online, interactive map showing the names and addresses of all handgun permit-holders in Westchester and Rockland counties. The map, published in December, infuriated many readers and prompted a blogger to post the names and addresses of Journal News staffers in retaliation. The Journal News removed its online map 27 days later, stating that the removal was ""not a concession to critics"" but that the map had served its purpose. The paper's publisher, Janet Hasson, defended the decision to report the information. ""One of our roles is to report publicly available information on timely issues, even when unpopular,"" Hasson said in a statement. ""We knew publication of the database (as well as the accompanying article providing context) would be controversial, but we felt sharing information about gun permits in our area was important in the aftermath of the Newtown shootings."" Pistol permit information is now exempt from the Freedom of Information Law until May 15. Permit holders have until then to submit privacy requests to keep that exemption. Forms filled out after May 15 will still be considered, but their information may be subject to FOIL in the meantime, and applications for new permits will have the option to keep their personal information under wraps as well.

"(CNN) -- The drive for a tough federal gun control law has hit a political roadblock. But that's not silencing Joe Biden and Mike Bloomberg. The loquacious vice president and the outspoken New York mayor on Thursday touted the ""importance of passing common sense legislation to reduce gun violence,"" including the need for a stiff background check system for all gun sales. They joined families of those killed last December in the shooting massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, to push for new rules. They spoke at New York City Hall as prospects for a ban on semi-automatic weapons styled after military assault weapons appeared to founder. Bloomberg cited public opinion polls showing wide support for background checks, saying ""there's no real debate"" among Americans about this issue. He said nationwide background checks on all gun sales would save lives, and that the only question ""is if Congress has the courage to do the right thing."" A national requirement for background checks on all gun sales is needed because guns purchased in states with ""weak gun laws"" end up in states with stricter requirements, Bloomberg said. ""We remain optimistic that Congress will take action this spring,"" he said. ""There is no question that if this becomes law, it will keep guns out of the hands of people who should not have them. It will reduce violent crime. It will save lives. We know that's true, because in states that already require background checks on private sales, the rate of women murdered by an intimate partner armed with a gun is 38% lower than in states that don't have such background checks."" The ban proposal, categorically opposed by the National Rifle Association, would get fewer than 40 votes, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday, far below the threshold needed to defeat a filibuster or pass the Senate. Instead, the ban could be offered as an amendment to the gun legislation on the Senate floor in order to get a vote on it, Reid said. Biden, who lauded Bloomberg's ""immense"" and ""committed"" gun control work, criticized those who say the proposals would violate rights. ""Tell me how it violates anyone's constitutional rights to limit (ammunition clips) to 10 rounds,"" Biden said. ""Think about Newtown. ... Think about how many children and teachers may be alive today had (the shooter) had to reload (more often than) he did."" He worked to raise the spirits of people discouraged by the power of the gun lobby. ""I was told in 1992, when I introduced many of these reforms, that there was no way, you never beat the gun lobby, it's not possible. Well, in 1994, we did. In 1994, reason prevailed, and we passed the assault weapons ban, a limitation on the size of magazines, and a number of other measures, including expanding the so-called Brady Bill and background checks."" Many reforms have since expired. But, he said, ""One thing I want to lay to rest at the outset: They worked. They all had a positive impact on public safety."" Biden said that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Newtown was conducted with ""a weapon of war, and that weapon of war has no place on American streets."" The shooter, Adam Lanza, gunned down 20 children and six adult staff members with a Bushmaster AR-15 rifle. ""Taking it off American streets has no impact on one's constitutional right to own a weapon,"" Biden said. He also noted that conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia ""acknowledged that government has a right to limit certain weapons from being able to be possessed by American citizens."" He expressed his admiration for the Newtown families and said their presence has helped move legislation through the Senate Judiciary Committee and gives such gun control reform a ""fighting chance."" ""It takes an enormous amount of courage to be here,"" Biden said to the families. ""And you say, well, what's the courage? Having lost a child, I understand that every time you show up at something that ranges from a memorial service, or to talk about the circumstances in which your child was lost, it comes back to you in a flash, as if they got that phone call yesterday. And I told you before, I don't know how you do it, but you do it. You do it."" (Biden's first wife and the couple's 1-year-old daughter were killed in a car accident in 1972.) Biden argued against those who say assault weapons and high-capacity magazines can't be banned. He said gun-trafficking legislation will give police power ""to be able to deal more rationally with straw sales, those sales where people go in, buy multiple guns, and then sell them to the bad guys."" He said the more police are on the streets, the better. The proposed reforms, Biden said, ""will not solve every problem. It will not end every gun death. But it will substantially reduce it. And it matters."" CNN's Jason Hanna contributed to this report .","Bloomberg cites the need for background checks .

"New York (CNN) -- New York authorities said Thursday that they had reached a deal with 23 gun show operators in the state after an investigation revealed weapons were sold without proper background checks. Under the new agreement, authorities say it will be easier to track whether sellers are following the proper safety steps. ""Gun violence is everyone's concern,"" New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman said in a statement, ""and I'm proud that we've worked with gun show operators to create simple procedures to ensure that deadly weapons don't make it into the hands of felons, terrorists, the dangerously mentally ill or anyone else who could not pass a background check."" The new measures, which authorities hope will be a model for other states, include a requirement that weapons sold by private sellers at gun shows be tagged so operators can be sure proper background checks were performed. The 23 gun show operators who signed on to the deal represent 80% of the gun shows in the state, the attorney general's office said. Authorities hope all gun shows statewide will sign on to the deal by the end of the year. Dozens of gun shows are held across America on any given weekend. Gun shows open to consumers are big business, accounting for about 10% of the industry's $3.5 billion in annual sales, Wedbush Securities analyst Rommel Dionisio said earlier this year. New York is among the states that require background checks at gun shows, and the state's gun laws are among the nation's most stringent. In January, Gov. Andrew Cuomo signed laws fortifying New York's existing assault weapons ban, limiting the number of bullets allowed in magazines and strengthening rules that govern the mentally ill, which includes a requirement to report potentially harmful behavior. Gun rights advocates have pushed to repeal the laws, while some state lawmakers have pushed for stricter measures. On Thursday, Democratic New York State Assemblywoman Linda B. Rosenthal of Manhattan introduced a bill that would ban children under age 12 from attending gun shows. New York's gun show deal comes just a few days after a U.S. Senate committee approved legislation that would expand background checks covering all U.S. firearms sales, part of a federal gun-control push prompted by December's school massacre in Connecticut. The background check proposal by Sen. Charles Schumer, a New York Democrat, is expected to face tough opposition once the full Senate takes it up. Schumer's bill would mandate background checks for all gun sales, including private transactions. The NRA has said increased checks are nothing more than an attempt to create a national gun registry, a move the group vehemently opposes. Forty percent of all firearms purchased in the United States are sold without background checks because the guns aren't bought from a federally licensed firearms dealer, Lindsay Nichols, an attorney with the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said earlier this year. Rather, those weapons are bought at gun shows, on street corners, over the Internet or from friends or neighbors, Nichols said. CNN's Chris Boyette, Todd Sperry, Mike Martinez, Catherine E. Shoichet and CNNMoney contributed to this report.","New York authorities reach a deal with 80% of the state's gun show operators .

"(CNN) -- Inter Milan have been hit with a €50,000 ($65,500) fine after their fans racially abused AC Milan striker Mario Balotelli during Sunday's derby match at the San Siro. Balotelli was making just his fourth appearance for Milan against city rivals Inter, a team with which he spent four years between 2006 and 2010. The sanction comes after Inter's fans chanted racial slurs at the 22-year-old Italy star, as well as displaying offensive banners and aiming a laser pen at the 22-year-old, who signed from English Premier League champiins Manchester City in January. Balotelli himself was fined €10,000 ($13,000) for aiming a gesture at fans as he headed down the tunnel at the end of the 1-1 draw. A statement from the Italian Football Federation (FIGC) cited chanting which started in the 11th minute and was repeated in the 15th, 16th and 19th minutes. The punishment is also for similar chants directed at another player in the 30th and 44th minutes of the first half. Reports suggested Inter fans waved inflatable bananas, although there was no evidence connecting the objects with any incidents of racism. Inter were fined €15,000 ($19,000) earlier this month after their fans chanted racist abuse about Balotelli during a match with Chievo. It is the second time in recent months an AC Milan player has been the target of abuse. During an exhibition match with Fourth Division team Pro Patria in January, Ghanaian midfielder Kevin Prince-Boateng walked off the pitch after he was subject to monkey chants. Balotelli was at the center of an embarrassing incident for the AC Milan hierarchy just days after signing for the team. Paolo Berlusconi, the club's vice president and younger brother of owner and former Italian prime minister Silvio, referred to Balotelli as ""the family's little black boy."" Balotelli has made an instant impact on his return to Serie A, scoring four goals in four games as Milan climbed above Inter in the table and into fourth place. The striker's time at Manchester City was dominated by controversy, including an altercation with manager Roberto Mancini on the club's training ground.","Inter Milan fined $65,500 for racist abuse during Sunday's derby with AC Milan .

"(CNN) -- Whoever killed six people in a Memphis, Tennessee, home may still be on the loose, police said Tuesday. They asked the community for help in solving the slayings. Police and fire units responded Monday after six people were killed in Memphis, Tennessee. Police found six people -- two men, two women and two boys -- dead in a home in a north Memphis neighborhood Monday, said Memphis police Lt. Joe Scott. Three other children who were wounded in the home were taken to a hospital. Scott did not release the names of the victims. He said there was no sign of forced entry into the home, and evidence at the scene indicated that the killer or killers left the house. Detectives were trying to determine the day of the killings, which could have occurred as early as Saturday, Scott said. He said police had not developed a suspect and need people to come forward with information. ""We need the community's help,"" he said. ""These were children that were brutally killed. We know that there are people out there that heard things, saw something. This is a stain on our community. We really need the community's help to solve this."" The four dead adults were shot and the two dead children were stabbed, sources told CNN affiliate WMC-TV. The wounded children -- a 7-year-old boy, a 10-month-old girl and a 4-year-old whose gender wasn't immediately known -- were transported to Le Bonheur Children's Medical Center. They were treated for gunshot wounds, said hospital spokeswoman Jennilyn Utkov, who said she did not have any additional information about their conditions. At least one of the wounded children also was stabbed, police told the Commercial Appeal newspaper. The newspaper reported Tuesday that two of them were in very critical condition and one was in serious condition. A neighbor told CNN Tuesday that he heard gunshots coming from the house Saturday night. ""I heard about six or seven shots,"" said Wayne Bolden, a landscaper who said he lives across the street from the home where the killings occurred. ""I did not call the police because you always hear shooting in this neighborhood. Now I wish I would have called."" He said he did not see any movement at the home the next day.  The two cars, a van and a passenger car, never moved. Monday, he saw many police cars at the home and heard about the killings, he said. Bolden said a family that included a man, a woman and five or six children moved into the home about five months ago. ""I did not know him by name,"" Bolden said of the man. ""But the kids were always out playing, and he would barbecue outside on his front porch."" A prayer service was held for the victims Tuesday morning at the family's nearby church, said Keith Norman, senior pastor at First Baptist Church. He said he had been asked by the police to counsel the family members of the victims. Another prayer service was scheduled for 6 p.m., he said, and some of the victims' family members are expected to attend. ""There are multiple families affected by this,"" said Norman, who said he did not want to speak about what led to the killings. ""We are just praying for the family members and trying to help them get through this."" Police do not know what was behind the violence, the Commercial Appeal newspaper reported. ""We just don't know the motive or cause of death, but we do have four adults and two children [dead],"" Memphis police Lt. Jerry Guin told the paper. Rob Robinson told the Commercial Appeal that he was the landlord for the brick, single-family house that rented for $550 per month. ""They were very nice, very polite to me,"" Robinson told the paper of the residents. ""It's kind of surprising, actually. I've never had any trouble with them, no damage to the property. They paid their rent and even helped with repairs and stuff."" Neighbor Leo Baker told WMC-TV he has lived nearby for 10 years but did not know the residents of the home. ""It's sad you come home to find out something like this has gone on,"" Baker said. ""It's kind of sad, and scary too."" Video footage showed emergency vehicles on the scene, with people embracing in rainy weather outside police tape surrounding the home. ""I've been on a scene where there were one or two or three [victims], but I don't remember anything this large,"" Guin told the Commercial Appeal. The newspaper reported that the shooting appeared to be the city's deadliest mass killing since 1973, when 28-year-old David Sanders randomly shot and killed five people before being shot dead by police. In 2000, police said firefighter Frederick Williams confessed to a shooting in Memphis in which four people were killed -- his wife, a sheriff's deputy and two fellow firefighters.

"(CNN) -- The Obama administration is considering shifting lethal drone operations run by the Central Intelligence Agency over to the military, U.S. officials tell CNN. The proposal is under ""serious consideration,"" one U.S. official said. The official said no final decision has been made, and that there is no specific time frame in place, but that the change is being considered ""due to a desire for greater transparency in who is being targeted."" By law, the military is not able to act covertly the way the CIA can, and it must answer to Congress. The Daily Beast website first reported on the potential shift. The military would operate and fly the drones, an administration official told CNN, but targeting would still be done jointly by various agencies. The shift would happen over time. ""It won't happen overnight,"" the U.S. official said, adding that operations in some countries would transfer to U.S. military control before other nations. ""Yemen is an example of one of the first programs that could shift,"" the official tells CNN, while shifting the responsibility for the program that operates in Pakistan ""would be much further out.""

"(CNN) -- We're in the thick of the South Carolina Republican Primary, and all the ugly old stereotypes are being deployed as shorthand for one very beautiful state. You know, the characterization of South Carolina as a swamp of sleazy politics and brutal attack ads, a Bible Belt bastion of rednecks and racism, a state defined by Bob Jones University. Sometimes these stereotypes are floated in political conversation as evidence of how ""real"" the state is in determining the true feelings of the conservative base. Yes, South Carolina is conservative -- especially compared with Washington, Los Angeles and New York City. But it is complex and constantly evolving, containing one of the oldest cities in America and a growing population, especially along the coastline. My family moved there when I was 14, and we love the state -- and especially the elegant, functional and lyrical city of Charleston -- with the zeal of the converted. For my parents, it is home. So below are three stubborn stereotypes about South Carolina that need to be confronted with facts. This isn't Strom Thurmond's state anymore . South Carolina is sometimes stereotyped as a lonely bastion of rural white social conservatives. In fact, the state is nearly 30% African-American -- more than double the national average. An influx of immigrants from other states and retirees looking for a better quality of life have helped transform the state over the past three decades, boosting its population 15% in the past decade alone. Most of this growth has happened on the coastline -- especially around Charleston, Myrtle Beach and Hilton Head Island-- and the booming Greenville-Spartanburg metro area in the Upstate. Thanks to a combination of Right to Work laws and reduced tax burden, major manufacturing companies have relocated plants to the state, including BMW and Boeing. Nearly 60% of the state population lives in cities, towns or suburbs -- and just more than 40% of the state was born elsewhere. ""People don't take into account the general migration of wealthy, well-educated, generally successful retirees and their families to South Carolina and the South in general in the last two decades,"" attests Will Cathcart, former managing editor of The Charleston Mercury. This influx also makes for more in-state political diversity than is commonly understood. Longtime Charleston Mayor Joe Riley is a Democrat who recently won his 10th term in a nonpartisan election. Democratic House Whip James Clyburn also hails from the state. But perhaps the ultimate symbol of how South Carolina has changed is U.S. Rep. Tim Scott, an African-American tea party conservative who defeated former Sen. Strom Thurmond's son in a 2010 primary to represent the First District, where the Civil War started. Bob Jones University doesn't represent the state . Yes, there are many social conservatives and evangelicals in South Carolina -- especially in the Upstate, near controversial Bob Jones University. But they are seen more as a local curiosity than a real barometer of statewide opinion -- small businesses and the beach and hunting culture define day-to-day life in South Carolina more than the Bible Belt. Sixty-percent of GOP primary voters identified as evangelical four years ago, but that's the same percentage as the Iowa caucuses. And while just 11% of Iowa caucus-goers identified as moderate, in South Carolina that number grows to 24%. Finally, don't forget that John McCain won the South Carolina primary in 2008, notably without major evangelical support. Fiscal conservatives and military veterans responded to his message of political reform, a local tradition carried out by Sen. Lindsey Graham and former Gov. Mark Sanford -- before he went hiking the Appalachian Trial. The Bob Jones University president endorsed Mitt Romney last time around -- despite maintaining that Mormonism is a cult -- and Romney came in fourth. Gov. Nikki Haley doesn't speak for the Tea Party . Elected in 2010, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley is a rapidly rising star in national politics. It's easy to see why -- at 39, she is the first female and the first Indian-American to hold the position of South Carolina governor. A tea party favorite in 2010, her surprisingly narrow election -- 51% to 47% was nonetheless a reminder of the reality of the New South, and the growing diversity of the Republican Party. When she endorsed Romney, it was considered big news and the news release headline was dutifully reprinted -- ""Romney receives Tea Party support in South Carolina."" But Haley's national profile is outstripping her in-state popularity, which stands at 34.6%, according to a recent Winthrop University poll. Surreally, this makes Haley less popular in South Carolina than President Barack Obama, who clocks in at 44% in the same poll and who lost the Palmetto State by 9 points in 2008. The real leader of the tea party in South Carolina -- and a national force as well -- is Sen. Jim DeMint, and he's not endorsing any presidential candidate this time around. There's no question that South Carolina is pivotal for the Republican presidential nomination -- the winner has been the nominee since 1980. But the differences between the Palmetto State and the New Hampshire primary or Iowa caucuses should be understood with the proper perspective. One of the biggest differences is the state of the local economy -- Iowa and New Hampshire have unemployment rates well below the national average, but in South Carolina the unemployment rate is close to 10% -- adding to the calculus that Newt Gingrich's Super PAC made when it decided to unleash the anti-Bain Capital ad. Likewise, Rick Santorum might do well in the state as much for his focus on strengthening U.S. manufacturing as his much-vaunted social conservative purism. And if Romney does win the primary, it will be aided in part by the fact that he is the most center-right figure remaining in the Republican field. As CNN heads down to Charleston for Thursday night's debate, it's all just a reminder not to fall back on lazy national narratives but instead find the real facts when it comes to the great state of South Carolina. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Avlon.","John Avlon: Stories refer to South Carolina in no-longer true, if ever, stereotypes .

"Ridgeland, South Carolina (CNN) -- After months in an immigration detention facility, Hector Adame was so surprised when guards said he could go that he didn't believe them. ""They had to shout (the news) at him so he would leave,"" his wife, Victorina, said this week. The family soon learned that Adame -- who had first been arrested on a drunk driving charge -- was one of more than 2,000 immigration detainees federal authorities released last month in a controversial move that officials said would cut costs as forced budget cuts loomed. But the construction worker's joy at being released was short-lived. Now, the undocumented immigrant is back behind bars. So are more than two dozen others, according to federal officials. ""The 28 individuals were brought back into ICE custody after either violating the terms of their supervision or after the agency discovered information not available during an initial review of their case,"" U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement spokeswoman Barbara Gonzalez said in a written statement. ""ICE will continue to review the terms of the release for the individuals as part of its routine practice and will reconsider conditions as necessary."" Adame was detained again after an arrest for driving without a license, his wife says, adding that she thinks authorities targeted him because they wanted to send him back to the detention facility. ""They were waiting for him,"" Victorina Adame says. Debate over the decision to release detainees resurged this week at a hearing before the House Judiciary Committee, where some lawmakers accused the country's top immigration official of releasing detainees for political reasons. ""This release is a recipe for disaster that is irresponsible and unjustified,"" said Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia who chairs the committee. ""Ultimately, these nonsensical actions demonstrate the inability and lack of desire on behalf of the administration to enforce the law even against illegal immigrants convicted of serious crimes."" ICE officials have said the move was made because the agency was preparing its year-end budget and had to take the $85 billion in forced government-wide budget cuts, known as sequestration, into account. And they stressed that detainees released were non-criminals or low-risk offenders without serious criminal histories. This week, ICE Director John Morton maintained that the measure was necessary to cut costs. ""The agency is asked to do far more than Congress could appropriate or could rationally appropriate to the agency. We are in a situation where there are 11 million people on average who are here unlawfully. The agency has resources to remove about 400,000 a year, which is less than 4% and it is why at the end of the day, I think, bipartisan efforts to come to some level of comprehensive immigration reform is the thoughtful way out,"" he said this week. ""The agency is never going to be able to detain and remove everybody as a matter of budget nor does it make sense as a matter of policy."" Morton said the detainees that were released were not dangerous, and that he had to find some way to make ends meet. ""I did not want to rob Peter to pay Paul,"" he said. ""My view is that we need to maintain the operations of the agency."" Rep. Trey Gowdy, a Republican from South Carolina, criticized that explanation. ""Now, I've counted six times you have said you didn't want to rob Peter to pay Paul,"" Gowdy said. ""I don't want Peter or Paul to rob one of our fellow citizens because you guessed wrong on who to release."" Meanwhile, Victorina Adame says she and her five children are left looking at pictures of her husband in their South Carolina home, wondering when they'll see him again and whether he'll be deported to Mexico. CNN's Catherine E. Shoichet contributed to this report.","More than two dozen detainees who were released are back behind bars, ICE says .

"London (CNN) -- The first solo exhibition in about 20 years of early photos of the Beatles taken by a British photographer who designed five of their UK album covers is on display in London. Robert Freeman photographed and designed the Fab Four's second to sixth album covers and was the group's favored snapper for three years between 1963 and 1966 in their early and middle stages of fame. Freeman also traveled with the band on their momentous first tour of USA in 1964 when Beatlemania first spread across the Atlantic. Freeman, who is now in his 70s and lives near Seville in Spain, sold his entire Beatles collection to rock 'n' roll photo curator and agent Raj Prem many years ago. The 58-year-old Londoner has put up a solo exhibition of Freeman's work at Snap Galleries in Piccadilly Arcade, London. ""Someone gave me Freeman's number in Spain and I contacted him and flew over to see him,"" Prem says. ""I was so impressed by his collection of Beatles photos that I kind of did a deal and gave him some money and bought the entire collection. The increasing scarcity of the prints is making them go up in value all the time,"" he adds. ""I did not know when I bought them that they would go up because I was at the beginning of my career -- I had no idea at all,"" says Prem. Freeman made no more than 25 editions of each print and many editions are now almost sold out. He is not making any more prints, so for some of the photos on sale, there is just one example left -- signed and numbered by him. ""He was very close to Lennon,"" Prem says, explaining that Freeman even lived in a flat below Lennon in London for one year. Freeman also photographed and designed the covers of John Lennon's first two books, ""In His Own Write"" and ""A Spaniard in the Works"" too. According to Prem, Freeman described Lennon as ""highly creative, very witty and a very surreal person -- the most interesting of all the Beatles."" ""But he did say to me once that he found Ringo Starr the most interesting to photograph as he's got a large nose and a face with a kind of pathos. He always said Lennon was the best looking,"" he adds. After graduating from Cambridge University in 1959, Freeman became a photographer working for the Sunday Times and various magazines. It was moody black and white pictures he took of John Coltrane at the London Jazz Festival in 1963 that impressed Beatles manager Brian Epstein that led to his first commission -- to shoot the cover of the Beatles' second album, ""With the Beatles."" It is now one of the most famous sleeves in rock music. He proceeded to photograph the next four consecutive Beatles' album covers -- ""A Hard Day's Night,"" ""Beatles for Sale,"" ""Help!"" and ""Rubber Soul"" -- all considered seminal and ahead of their time compared to LP designs at the time. Some covers, like the music, were modified for the U.S. market. ""Freeman was not the only photographer who took pictures of the Beatles but he was the only one who worked with them for a continuous period of three years and he was their favorite photographer during that time,"" Prem says. ""He toured with them. He was obviously a trusted confidante."" Freeman also shot many other rock stars and photographed the first ever Pirelli Calendar in 1964, but according to Prem his work with the Beatles ""overshadowed everything else he ever did."" 'With the Beatles' shot him to fame,"" Prem says. ""'Please Please Me' was a very anodyne shot and was not so easy to recall as the following album."" He puts the ""With the Beatles"" album cover among the top three Beatles album cover designs of all time, the others being ""Abbey Road"" and ""Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band."" Freeman also took many other portraits of the boys in different settings capturing their individual personalities and he designed the opening and closing credits of the comedy films ""A Hard Day's Night"" (1964) and ""Help!"" (1965), both of which starred the rock group. But when his proposal for the sixth album, ""Revolver,"" was rejected, he pretty much stopped working with them after that, Prem says. ""I don't think he was upset -- he felt it was inevitable. I don't think he stayed in touch with the Beatles after that. He continued with his other photography."" But he recalls: ""Freeman was living in Hong Kong when Lennon was assassinated in 1980 and he told me that he had a photo of Lennon on his wall and it fell down at exactly the same time."" ""What makes the Beatles unique is that their appeal is not purely nostalgic,"" Prem explains. ""The Rolling Stones mean little now to anyone under the age of 30 whereas the Beatles are probably bigger now than they were at the time. When they went over on their first tour to the USA they got what was then the biggest audience in the history of American TV when they appeared on The Ed Sullivan Show, "" Prem adds. Read about when the Beatles hit America . Japan and America are his biggest customer market for this collection, which has prints priced from $1,500 (£1,000) upwards. ""We've had a fabulous reaction from Beatles fans,"" says Guy White, the director of Snap Galleries. ""We've had all age ranges and people from all round the world coming to see us. As soon as the show went up, we found that all the Beatles and rock 'n' roll tours of London were including the gallery on their itineraries. We've had fans alongside serious collectors,"" he says. ""His five covers are so interesting because, putting it simply, they show five completely different ways of portraying four heads in a 12-inch square."" The most expensive print on sale is an ultra large size sepia print of Rubber Soul, the only one left the world, which is up for sale at $45,000 (£30k.) In his coffee table book, The Beatles: A Private View, Paul McCartney is quoted as saying of Freeman's work: ""I have a feeling that Bob's photos were amongst the best ever taken of The Beatles."" The exhibition Robert Freeman: Beatles for Sale continues at Snap Galleries, Piccadilly Arcade, London, until March 16, 2013. All the prints are from the Raj Prem collection.","Robert Freeman was favored snapper of Beatles between 1963 and 1965 .

"Paris (CNN) -- Francois Hollande defeated French President Nicolas Sarkozy in a presidential runoff Sunday, signaling a shift to the left as the country and Europe fight to dig out of a weak economy. In a victory speech to supporters in Tulle, Hollande declared his win ""a great date for our country, and a new start for Europe."" The Socialist challenger promised to govern for all of France. ""Many people have been waiting for this moment for many long years. Others, younger, have never known such a time. ... I am proud to be capable to bring about hope again,"" he told the cheering crowd. ""Tonight, there are not two Frances. ... There is only one France, only one nation that is united with the same destiny,"" Hollande said. The president-elect, who will be the nation's first left-wing president since Francois Mitterrand left office in 1995, suggested there was a sense of relief in many European countries because of his win. ""Austerity can no longer be something that is inevitable,"" he said. Later, Hollande went to Paris, where he addressed a large crowd at the Bastille. Supporters waved flags and shouted his name. ""I know what many people feel -- years and years of wounds, of ruptures, and we have to repair, recover, unite. That is what we're going to do together,"" he vowed. Hollande congratulated Sarkozy, who earlier conceded to Hollande as results from exit polls and official tallies in the runoff election came in. ""I carry the entire responsibility for this defeat, and I'm going to say why. I fought for the values of responsibility, and I'm not a man who does not accept his responsibilities,"" Sarkozy said from his Paris campaign headquarters, as members of the crowd shouted, ""No!"" ""I'm ready to become a French person amongst French people, and more than ever I have the love for my country deeply ingrained in my heart,"" Sarkozy said. With almost all of the votes counted, Hollande was leading with 51.6% to Sarkozy's 48.4%, the nation's Interior Ministry said. Voter turnout was reported at more than 80%. Exit polls said Hollande won 51.9% of the vote, France 2 television reported. Crowds roared at the center-left candidate's campaign headquarters as the exit poll results came out Sunday evening. Celebratory car horns blared along the Champs-Elysees in Paris. ""It's a great night, full of joy for so many young people all across the country,"" said Thierry Marchal-Beck, president of the Movement of Young Socialists. U.S. President Barack Obama called Hollande shortly after results were in to congratulate the newly elected president and invite him to the White House. Sarkozy had fought to keep his job amid a wave of discontent over his inability to rein in unemployment. He defended his economic record despite low growth and unemployment at about 10%, saying the impact of Europe's debt crisis could have been far worse. France is a key player in plans to lead the eurozone out of its debt crisis, making the election vital to the region. Sarkozy's defeat marks the latest -- and most significant -- of at least half a dozen European leaders swept from office during the eurozone economic crisis, including the Greek and Italian prime ministers. France's vote came the same day as the Greek parliamentary election. Exit polls in that country indicated Greece's ruling coalition appeared headed for steep losses, while parties on the far left and far right were poised to make significant gains amid anger over austerity measures. Hollande and Sarkozy traded insults last week in the only televised head-to-head debate of the campaign. Sarkozy labeled Hollande a liar and a ""little slanderer,"" while Hollande accused the president of shirking his responsibilities, cronyism and favoring the privileged over France's poor. Both candidates reached out to France's undecided voters since the first-round vote on April 22 left them the only two standing. Centrist Francois Bayrou, who took 9% of the first round vote, delivered a boost to Hollande's campaign Thursday when he said he would vote for the Socialist and urged his supporters to vote according to their conscience. Sarkozy has been president since 2007. CNN's Jim Bittermann, Hala Gorani, Saskya Vandoorne and Stephanie Halasz contributed to this report.","NEW: President-elect Francois Hollande addresses a large crowd of supporters in Paris .

"(EW.com) -- ""Beautiful Creatures"" is arriving in a marketplace full of ""Twilight"" junkies still eager for their supernatural teen-romantic fix, and the film's concept couldn't be clearer: It's ""Twilight"" with the sexes reversed. This time it's the boy who's the mortal: moody, bookish Ethan, the outsider in his sleepy small town of Gatlin, S.C., though Alden Ehrenreich plays him more like a sensitive jock on ""Glee."" Lena (Alice Englert), the new girl at school, comes from a family of witches (or, as they're known here, Casters), and on the day she turns 16 she'll be ''claimed,'' either by the light side or (more likely, due to a family curse) the dark side. Adapted from the popular YA novel by Kami Garcia and Margaret Stohl, ""Beautiful Creatures"" is lushly pictorial and not-too-badly acted. The best thing in the movie is Englert, who has a fresh, unretouched, Jane Austen-gone-goth allure. (She is also Jane Campion's daughter.) Jeremy Irons, as Lena's smoking-jacketed rotter-aristocrat uncle, and Emma Thompson, as her floridly angry mother, are like blithe spirits out of a Dark Shadows sequel you want to see. But ""Beautiful Creatures,"" more than the ""Twilight"" films, lacks danger and momentum.

"(CNN) -- The family of an American tourist killed in Turkey won't tell her two young sons what happened to their mother until their father returns from his tragic search in Istanbul, the woman's parents said Monday. Sarai Sierra, from Staten Island, New York, had been missing since January 22, when she was supposed to return to the United States. Her father, who had gone to the airport to pick her up, originally thought his daughter had been detained in customs, he said. After a search that included her husband and brother traveling to Istanbul, Turkish police found Sierra's body Saturday, near ancient stone walls in Istanbul's Sarayburnu district, according to the semi-official Anatolian news agency. Sierra's sons, ages 9 and 11, were staying with family friends until their father returned. ""That's something we're going to do together as a family, and the father will be speaking to them,"" Sierra's mother, Betzeida Jiminez, said of talking to the children about their mother. ""It's something that is going to be hard and he (husband Steven Sierra) is going to talk about that when he comes back."" The Sarai Sierra's family said in a news conference Monday that despite the outcome, they were grateful they were offered some closure. ""I thank God that we were able to find her and able to have her with us,"" Jimenez said. Absent from the press conference was Sierra's sister. ""My daughter couldn't be here today because she's too broken,"" Jiminez said. ""All she does is cry and she's going through a hard time, her and her sister were very close."" Authorities in Turkey said 21 people had been questioned in Sierra's disappearance and death. Prosecutors were given court permission to take blood and DNA samples from all those questioned. Sierra flew alone to Istanbul on January 7. She had gone back to school part-time for her bachelor's degree and planned the trip between semesters, her friend Magalena Rodriguez told CNN Monday. ""She did a lot of researching about the area, about where she was going to stay, the safest places to go and the time of day to travel,"" Rodriguez said. Rodriguez had originally planned on traveling with Sierra, but canceled her plans for financial reasons. Rodriguez, who had last texted with her friend on January 18, described Sierra as witty, with a huge sense of humor. Police told CNN's sister network CNN Turk that the body of the 33-year-old woman showed signs of stab wounds. However, the police chief of Istanbul, Huseyin Capkin, said Sierra died from a blow to her head. Police suspected she had been killed at a different location than where she had been found. Sierra was an amateur photographer who had amassed more than 3,000 followers since she joined the photo sharing app Instagram last year. Her husband said she had connected with people through the app and that some followers had even offered Sierra to act as a tour guide during her trip. Steven Sierra and David Jimenez, Sarai Sierra's brother, traveled to Istanbul to help with the search. ""The last we heard from my wife was Monday morning on the 21st. She had spoken with her sister and the last thing she said was, 'I'm coming home tomorrow,' and she was excited and put a little smiley face at the end of her statement,"" Sierra told CNN in an interview from Istanbul on January 30. ""You're hoping that she's OK wherever she's at, that she's not hurting, that she's not cold, that she's being fed,"" Steven Sierra said, choking back tears. Sarai Sierra's brother said he had been worried about his sister's solo trip. ""We were nervous. Were just like 'always be mindful of what you do, be aware of your surroundings. Don't get too comfortable to the point where you drop your guard down,'"" David Jimenez said from Istanbul. But Jimenez and Sierra's husband said Sarai was determined to complete challenges that she set for herself. As an example, they described how she competed in a triathlon several years ago, despite being a weak swimmer, and despite the fact that she did not own a bicycle. Instead, Sarai completed the cycling leg of the competition by borrowing a mountain bike from her husband. Sierra's photo feed while she was in Istanbul displayed images of the city's beautiful skyline and historic landmarks. She also squeezed in an excursion to Amsterdam in the Netherlands and to Germany, starting January 15. ""She chose to go to Amsterdam for the graffiti,"" her husband said. ""She informed me as far as how her time was out there. And she also had a tour guide that was helping her out there as well, who I know about and who I've spoken with personally."" Sierra returned to Istanbul on January 19. Three days later, she went missing. Sierra had rebooked her flight to arrive back early, on January 22, in part to surprise her young sons. Days before her scheduled trip home, Sierra spoke with her father, Dennis Jimenez, via Skype to remind him of her flight number and arrival time. When Dennis Jimenez went to the Newark, New Jersey, airport to pick Sierra up, she didn't show, he said. The airline told him she had never checked in for the flight. ""She kept in contact with us all the time,"" Sierra's mother said. ""And then not to hear from her? It's not like her."" After the tourist went missing, Turkish police released a surveillance camera video of her at a shopping mall in Istanbul, flipping through her iPad. The scenes from January 20 are the last known images of her. The manager of the small private hotel where Sierra was staying reported last seeing her the day the surveillance video was shot. That was a Sunday. Her Skype account, which she avidly used, went silent a day later. A day after that, she was not on her flight home. The time she last talked with her family, Sierra was planning on January 21 to see the Galata Bridge and visit the Asian side of Istanbul, her husband said. The former capital of the Byzantine and East Roman empires straddles the dividing line between the continents of Europe and Asia. After Sierra's family raised the alarm that she was missing, some of her belongings -- including her passport and medical cards -- were found in her room in Istanbul, though her iPhone and iPad were not there, according to her husband. Since Sierra's disappearance, Turkish police detained a Turkish man she had been in contact with, identified only by the first name Talan, according to CNN Turk.","The body of Sarai Sierra was found in Istanbul, Turkey, on Saturday .

"Cairo (CNN) -- Egyptians will vote in two weeks to approve, or reject, a new constitution -- a potentially pivotal moment for the North African nation that underwent a revolution a year ago and, more recently, has seen its president become the target of fierce protests. President Mohamed Morsy on Saturday announced a December 15 referendum date on what could become the nation's constitution, shortly it was presented to him by the Islamist-dominated assembly that crafted it. While his supporters cheered the move, there was little indication the vote or anything Morsy said would placate the opposition. ""(Morsy) put to referendum a draft constitution that undermines basic freedoms & violates universal values,"" said Mohamed ElBaradei, a Nobel laureate and head of Egypt's Constitution Party, on his Twitter account. ""The struggle will continue."" The proposed constitution will be published Sunday in government newspapers, said Hossam al-Gheryani, head of the 85-person group that pushed through its 234 articles Friday after 21 hours of haggling. Egypt effectively has been without a guiding constitution, as well as a legislature, since the 2011 revolution marked by the ouster of its longtime leader Hosni Mubarak. Thousands of the president's supporters packed streets around Cairo University on Saturday, taking part in marches and a massive rally organized by the Freedom and Justice Party, the Muslim Brotherhood's political branch that Morsy once led. They carried banners featuring Morsy's photo, waved the Egyptian flag and chanted their support. An even larger rally took place just south of Cairo in the city of Giza. It involved Brotherhood members, fellow Islamist groups and others including the Egyptian Revolution's Alliance, the Revolutionary Front to Protect the Revolution and the Coalition of the January 25th Youth. Other pro-Morsy rallies were held in the northern port city of Alexandria and the central city of Asiut. These events aimed to bolster Morsy after more than a week of protests against him, during which stones flew, demonstrators and police clashed and clouds of tear gas wafted through, among other places, Tahrir Square in central Cairo. That landmark square, which is across the Nile River from one large pro-Morsy rally, remained buzzing Saturday night with people who have camped out there and marched elsewhere to vent their anger at the president. They have called Morsy a dictator, even worse than Mubarak, for his edict declaring that his past and future decisions are immune from judicial oversight -- new power that the president insists is only temporary. They responded to his speech, which was blared over loudspeakers, by chanting, ""Leave, leave"" -- suggesting that, whatever comes of the constitutional referendum, their goal remains removing Morsy as president. Morsy's controversial edict, issued November 22, energized the opposition and led them to reoccupy Tahrir Square, as dissidents did in the winter of 2011. Seeds of Egypt's past sown long ago . Many saw it as an overbearing, undemocratic grab for power that left the president in charge without any checks and balances. Morsy described it as a necessary move to fight judges loyal to Mubarak's regime who were blocking progress in government. It engendered sharp opposition within Egypt's judiciary, with many courts basically shut down as judges and prosecutors went on strike. Despite the order, the nation's high administrative court has indicated it will review the proposed constitution -- though it's not clear, if they rule it invalid, if that will prevent the referendum. As part of his edict, Morsy had also given the constitutional assembly up to six more months to craft the pivotal document. But amid the raging discontent, the president spurred the group to speed up its work -- an expedited process that prompted Christian, liberal and leftist members of the group to walk-out in protest, with many of them later replaced by Islamists. Essam El-Erian, a senior Morsy adviser, insisted all viewpoints -- including the need to safeguard freedoms when it comes to things like gender and religion -- were taken into account nonetheless. But critics are unconvinced. Opinion: Don't blame Muslim Brotherhood for Morsy power grab . A quick glimpse at the constitution's articles show language dealing with individuals' civil rights, particularly how security forces and the justice system treats them. There is wording prohibiting arbitrary arrest and detention and ensuring due process, a sensitive topic in Egypt. Mubarak and his loyalists are blamed for jailing and harshly mistreating innocent people in the years before and especially during last year's uprising. One article stipulates no one in jail can be interrogated without a lawyer present, and if detainees don't have one, the judicial system must appoint one. Phone conversations, electronic correspondence and other communication could not be taped without a warrant. Protesters to Morsy: Roll back your decree or leave . While many of the articles sound democratic, the fine print indicates otherwise, some human rights advocates say. ""Moving a flawed and contradictory draft to a vote is not the right way to guarantee fundamental rights or to promote respect for the rule of law,"" said Joe Stork, deputy Middle East and North Africa director at Human Rights Watch. Mohamed Naeem, a member of the Egyptian Social Democratic Party, said he fears the proposed constitution would open the way for a theocracy by moving the country closer to Sharia law. The preamble includes language pertaining to women, saying they are equal to men, but it also accentuates their role as mothers. And the United Nations' high commissioner for human rights, Navi Pillay, has urged Morsy to reconsider the draft, saying a number of measures contained in it are incompatible with international human rights law. Beyond the details about the constitution itself, some see this month's vote more generally as a referendum on the government. Morsy took office in June as Egypt's first popularly elected president, following decades in which Mubarak held vast powers and limited dissent (including by banning the Muslim Brotherhood). But Morsy's recent moves have stirred suspicions that he and his Islamist allies are intent on amassing powers at the expense of others. Opinion: A new Egypt must learn political compromise . CNN's Reza Sayah, Amir Ahmed and Ben Brumfield contributed to this report.","NEW: President's supporters cheer proposed constitution at rallies in Cairo, elsewhere .

"Tokyo (CNN) -- Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe on Wednesday described as ""dangerous"" and ""regrettable"" the actions of a Chinese navy ship that Tokyo says put a radar-lock on a Japanese vessel last week. His comments come amid severely strained relations between the two Asian powers over a set of disputed islands in the East China Sea. The tensions over the islands -- which Japan currently administers but both countries claim sovereignty over -- have resulted in maritime standoffs and the scrambling of Japanese fighter jets in recent months. In the latest incident, Japan accused the Chinese navy ship of using radar to gather information on the location of a Japanese warship in the East China Sea. That type of radar could be used to produce data needed to fire upon the Japanese vessel. ""This is dangerous action that could have brought about an unexpected situation,"" Abe, who took office in December, said in parliament Wednesday. The prime minister, seen as more hawkish than his predecessor, Yoshihiko Noda, urged Beijing to show restraint ""so that the situation doesn't escalate."" Dispute explained: How a remote rock split China and Japan . The Japanese foreign ministry summoned the Chinese ambassador for a meeting Tuesday to lodge a formal protest regarding the accusations. Japanese Defense Minister Itsunori Onodera said Tuesday that Tokyo also suspects that China put a radar-lock on a Japanese navy helicopter on January 19. Japan repels Taiwan activists near disputed islands . China accuses Japan of provocations . China countered on Tuesday that it has been conducting regular patrols in Chinese waters and asked Japan not to interfere. ""We think the top priority for now is for Japan to stop all provocative actions it has been doing as sending ships and flights into Diaoyu islands sea and air space,"" Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Hua Chunying said, using the Chinese name for the disputed islands. The Japanese call the small, uninhabited islands the Senkakus. Near them are important shipping lanes, rich fishing grounds and possible oil deposits. The United States is ""concerned"" about the latest maritime incident between China and Japan, according to Victoria Nuland, the spokeswoman for the State Department. ""Actions such as this escalate tensions and increase the risk of an incident or a miscalculation, and they could undermine peace, stability and economic growth in this vital region,"" Nuland said at a regular news briefing Tuesday. The United States has tried to avoid getting dragged into the dispute, saying it doesn't take sides on such competing claims of sovereignty. But officials have admitted that the islands fall under a mutual security treaty between Washington and Tokyo. Asia's disputed islands -- who claims what? Relations soured by a sale . Disagreement over who owns the remote, rocky islands soured diplomatic and economic relations between Japan and China since September, soon after Japan announced it had bought several of the disputed islands from private Japanese owners. The deal was struck in part to prevent the islands from being bought by the controversial Tokyo Gov. Shintaro Ishihara, who had called for donations for a public fund to buy them. China was outraged, as were protesters who marched through several Chinese cities calling for boycotts of Japanese products and asserting Beijing's sovereignty over the islands. Some of the protests turned violent and damage to Japanese offices and businesses was reported. Dangerous Rocks: Can both sides back off peacefully? In December, the dispute escalated when Japan scrambled fighter jets after a Chinese plane was seen near the islands. A number of Chinese ships have also entered contested waters despite warnings from the Japanese Coast Guard. China says its claim extends back hundreds of years. Japan says it saw no trace of Chinese control of the islands in an 1885 survey, so formally recognized them as Japanese sovereign territory in 1895. Japan then sold the islands in 1932 to descendants of the original settlers. The Japanese surrender at the end of World War II in 1945 only served to cloud the issue further. The islands were administered by the U.S. occupation force after the war. But in 1972, Washington returned them to Japan as part of its withdrawal from Okinawa. Taiwan, which Beijing regards as a breakaway province, also lays claim to the islands. But the self-governing island has seldom rigorously advanced its claims because of an unwillingness to risk its good relationship with Japan, said Alan Dupont, a strategic analyst at the University of New South Wales in Sydney. He said last year that Taiwan's decision to become more assertive was a response to actions taken by China and Japan in the second half of 2012, as well as concerns over access to fishing and marine resources. Last week, Japanese Coast Guard ships fired water cannons and shouted warnings at a boat carrying activists from Taiwan who were attempting to land on the islands.","China rejects complaints about its navy patrols by Japan .

"Tripoli, Libya (CNN) -- After Libyans cast ballots in a ground-breaking parliamentary election, officials Sunday turned to the next step in determining the country's political future: counting the votes. Authorities started transporting ballot boxes from polling stations around the country to the main tally center in Tripoli, said Nuri Khalifa Al-Abbar, chairman of Libya's High National Election Commission. Tallying began at polling centers Saturday night. Some preliminary results could be announced Sunday or Monday, he said, according to the state-run LANA news agency. The election came 17 months after political demonstrations against longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi broke out in two Libyan cities. Those demonstrations spread, leading to a civil war, NATO air strikes, and Gadhafi's death by a gunshot wound to the head in October. Libyans turn out big in historic election . Saturday, about 1.7 million Libyans -- roughly 60% of the nation's 2.8 million registered voters -- cast ballots, Al-Abbar said. The turnout was expected to increase Sunday, as eight polling centers were opened after violence on election day stopped voters from casting ballots the day before. Celebrations in Tripoli began Saturday and continued overnight after the parliamentary vote, which many saw as the African nation's first steps to building a free and democratic nation. The city's main square -- once called Green Square for Gadhafi's political philosophy but now known as Martyr's Square for all those who fell in last year's revolution -- became a focal point for the celebrations, with cars packing the square and surrounding streets. Families and young men were driving, waving flags and honking horns, many to the tune of the revolutionary chant ""raise your head up high, you are a free Libyan."" The last time Libya held an election was almost half a century ago and for many people, the act of casting a ballot was novel after 42 years of Gadhafi's autocratic rule. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon congratulated the Libyan people on the election and also hailed the electoral staff for ""well-conducted and transparent"" polling. ""Last year, thousands of Libyans sacrificed their lives or suffered lasting injury in order to win the right of the Libyan people to build a new state founded on human dignity and the rule of law,"" Ban said in a statement. ""Yesterday, their determination was again on display as men and women, young and old, cast their ballots, many with deep emotion, even in some areas where they faced threats to their security."" There was significant voter participation, with about 80% of the nation's 3.5 million eligible voters registered by Saturday. But the election indicated a strong interest among people interested in being part of the nation's fledgling government as well. More than 3,500 candidates stood in the election for a 200-seat national assembly. The winners are expected to be announced by the end of next week. More than 13,000 soldiers were on the streets Saturday, but not all went smoothly. Two polling centers were set ablaze in the eastern city of Benghazi, said Alexander Graf Lambsdorff, head of the EU election assessment mission. And in two other cities, polls did not open until 2 p.m., six hours before they were set to close. Rights group: Rein in Libyan militias . In the eastern city of Ajdabiya, five polling centers opened but four others on the outskirts did not. Friday, anti-aircraft fire hit a Libyan air force helicopter transporting ballot boxes from the eastern city of Benghazi to nearby areas, the Interior Ministry said. One person was killed. It was unclear who was behind the attack. And protesters earlier last week attacked a warehouse and torched ballots and other election materials. This was one of several anti-election incidents staged by Libyans in the east who see an unequal distribution of seats in the national assembly. The 200 seats are allocated by population, reserving 100 for the western Tripolitania, 60 for Cyrenaica in the east, and 40 for the south. The mistrust stems from the many years of Gadhafi's rule, under which the eastern region felt largely neglected and marginalized. Benghazi emerged as the cradle of the Libyan uprising but many of its residents now feel their revolution has been usurped by the National Transitional Council based in Tripoli. Council member Mohammed al-Sayeh dismissed the disruptions as ""minor"" and said there was no lack of trust between east and west. ""Libya will be always united,"" he said. ""It is the first fair and legitimate election."" The parliamentary vote is a litmus test for post-Gadhafi Libya. The new national assembly will be tasked with appointing a transitional government and crafting a constitution. International court staff freed after detention in Libya .

"Washington (CNN) -- Daniel Inouye, a World War II veteran who received the Medal of Honor and represented Hawaii in the Senate for five decades, has died, his office announced Monday. He was 88. He died of respiratory complications Monday evening shortly at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, with his wife and son at his side. Inouye was hospitalized last week and had undergone procedures to regulate his oxygen intake. He won his ninth consecutive term in 2010 and was the second-longest-serving senator in the chamber's history, trailing only Sen. Robert Byrd of West Virginia. Inouye was a senator for all but three of Hawaii's 53 years as a state and had served as its first House member before that. Inouye: Man of courage, humanity, dignity . Senators of both parties took to the chamber floor Monday to mourn his death, and President Barack Obama described Inouye as ""a true American hero."" ""In Washington, he worked to strengthen our military, forge bipartisan consensus, and hold those of us in government accountable to the people we were elected to serve,"" Obama said in a statement. ""But it was his incredible bravery during World War II -- including one heroic effort that cost him his arm but earned him the Medal of Honor -- that made Danny not just a colleague and a mentor, but someone revered by all of us lucky enough to know him. Our thoughts and prayers are with the Inouye family."" Vice President Joe Biden, who served alongside Inouye in the Senate, recalled his ""moral bravery"" in the body. ""He was one of the most honorable men I ever met in my life, and one of the best friends you could hope for. He was honest, and fiercely loyal, and I trusted him absolutely."" Inouye gave preference for successor before he died . Fellow Hawaiian Daniel Akaka choked up as he said, ""It is very difficult for me to rise today with a heavy heart to bid aloha, aloha to my good friend, colleague and brother. ""Tomorrow will be the first day since Hawaii became a state in 1959 that Dan Inouye will not be representing us in Congress. Every child born in Hawaii will learn of Dan Inouye, a man who changed the islands forever."" Inouye enlisted in the U.S. Army shortly after the attack on Pearl Harbor. In World War II, Inouye lost an arm charging machine gun nests in San Terenzo, Italy, earning him the Medal of Honor. He was of Japanese heritage and served in an Army unit made up of Japanese-Americans. His battalion was the most decorated unit of the war. Meanwhile, stateside, many Japanese-Americans were held during the war by the government in internment camps based on their race. Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, remembered his late colleague as a ""unique, brave legislator"" and as a fellow veteran who was injured in war. Inouye's unit was in ""many of the most gruesome and difficult bloodlettings of the entire conflict,"" McCain said. ""In fierce combat, Dan Inouye was gravely wounded on the battlefield. He was brought home ... as we all know, (he) lost his arm."" What happened after that battlefield injury would lead to a long-standing friendship: Inouye was hospitalized alongside the second lieutenant who would also become a U.S. senator, Bob Dole. ""Danny and I saw service in World War II where he lost an arm and where I had other difficulties,"" Dole said in a statement. "" When we left the hospital, we eventually became United States senators and he was always telling his friends that I talked him into it. I don't recall it, but if Danny said it was true, that was good enough for me."" Dole said his friend reached out to all, regardless of the party. ""Never once do I recall his being critical of another colleague -- Republican or Democrat,"" he said. Inouye served as chairman of the Senate Committee on Appropriations and the Senate Commerce Committee, and was the first chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Dole remembers his friend and fellow veteran . As head of the Appropriations Committee, he defended the practice of earmarking funds for pet projects and brought millions to his home state. He gained national notoriety as a member of the Senate panel investigating the Watergate scandal in the 1970s. At the time of his death, Inouye was president pro tempore of the Senate and had held that position since the death of West Virginia's Robert Byrd in 2010. In that position, Inouye was third in the line of succession to the U.S. presidency, behind Vice President Biden and House Speaker John Boehner. Late Monday, the Senate approved a resolution giving Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid the authority to swear in Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, now the chamber's most senior Democrat, as the new Senate president pro tempore. Reid said in remembrance of Inouye, ""If there was ever a patriot, Dan Inouye was that patriot."" Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell described him as someone who ""rarely called attention to himself but who lived a remarkable American life filled with dignity and grace of the true hero that he was."" Inouye graduated from the University of Hawaii and the George Washington University School of Law. Asked recently how he would want to be remembered, the senator said: ""I represented the people of Hawaii and this nation honestly and to the best of my ability. I think I did OK,"" according to his office. His last word was ""Aloha,"" it said. Read more: People we lost in 2012 .

"Washington (CNN) -- Two Secret Service supervisors who have lost their jobs in a prostitute scandal during a recent trip to Colombia are David Chaney and Greg Stokes, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN National Security Contributor Fran Townsend on Thursday. They are among three people no longer with the agency in the wake of the incident immediately preceding President Barack Obama's trip to Colombia for the Summit of the Americas. They are among 11 total Secret Service employees who are under investigation. Attorney Lawrence Berger told CNN that he is representing Chaney and Stokes, but declined further comment, including why he is representing the two men. Berger is general counsel for the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, a union that includes the Secret Service, among other agencies. Authorities outside Chaney's home in Ashburn, Virginia, said that Chaney had relayed that he did not want to speak to reporters outside. Secret Service pushing out three members amid Colombia scandal . Chaney is identified as one of several hundred people -- including about 22 from the Department of Homeland Security -- who contributed to the Interagency Working Group on U.S. Government-Sponsored International Exchanges and Training, according to the group's FY2010, FY2008 and FY2007 annual reports. Created in 1998, that organization's mission is ""to make recommendations to the president for improving the coordination, efficiency, and effectiveness of United States Government-sponsored international exchanges and training,"" according to its website. A posting from David Chaney on Reunion.com states that he graduated from W.T. White High School in Dallas in 1982 and had been employed with the U.S. Secret Service since 1987. That message notes that he is married, has an adopted son and his assignments include a stint protecting former Vice President Dick Cheney. Chaney's father was a Secret Service agent, said the source with knowledge of the investigation. Stokes supervised the canine training unit at the Secret Service's James J. Rowley Training Center outside Washington, according to PetLife Radio and a career development posting on the University of Maryland's website. The agency has said that one of those who left the agency is a supervisory employee who is being allowed to retire. Another employee resigned, the agency said. A third agent -- also a supervisory employee -- is being pushed out, with the agency proposing he be removed. A U.S. official said on condition of not being identified that this agent plans to fight his ouster. It was not immediately clear whether this person was Chaney or Stokes. House Homeland Security Chairman Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told CNN on Thursday that he expects more Secret Service employees to leave the agency as soon as Friday. The other eight members allegedly involved in the scandal are on administrative leave and have had their security clearances suspended, according to the Secret Service. Ten military personnel are also being investigated for their possible participation. Questions raised about macho culture, women agents . They were all part of the ""jump team"" that flies in on military transport planes with the presidential limousine and other vehicles to be used in the president's motorcade, Townsend said. They arrived the morning of the incident, raising questions about whether the activity was planned. All the employees are accused of bringing prostitutes to Cartagena's Hotel El Caribe ahead of last week's visit by Obama, who was there to attend the Pan-American summit. According to sources, the alleged prostitutes -- the youngest of whom were in their early 20s -- had all signed in at the hotel, where the Secret Service members apparently stayed, flashing their local ID cards. One of these women allegedly was later involved in a dispute about how much she was to be paid for the night. That row brought the entire incident to light and sparked controversy in the United States and Colombia. Despite concerns that contact with Colombian nationals could have led to security breaches regarding President Barack Obama's activities in the South American nation, King said, ""from everything we know, nothing was compromised."" Former Colombian President Alvaro Uribe told CNN on Thursday that he rejects ""the idea that Cartagena is a destination for tourists seeking prostitution or illicit drugs."" He said the incident is due entirely to ""a lack of ethics (on the part of) the Secret Service of the United States."" U.S. congressmen offered similarly biting remarks. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi of California called the allegations ""disgusting,"" while Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid described the agents' alleged actions ""either really stupid or a total lack of common sense."" At least five investigations have, or will soon, be launched as a result. One Secret Service inquiry aims to get details and accountability regarding the specific incident, and the agency is also looking to bring in outsiders to examine whether this case is symptomatic of broader problems. The House Oversight Committee's leaders sent a letter to the Secret Service requesting specifics about what happened before, during and after the incident. And after saying he wanted a ""minute-by-minute, hour-by-hour account of what happened,"" King said four investigators from his homeland security panel are looking into the matter and may go to Colombia. In addition to the Secret Service employees, five members of America's elite Army Special Forces, or Green Berets, plus two people from the Navy, two from the Marines and one from the Air Force are being questioned, a U.S. official said. The Green Berets' failure to make curfew the night of the incident involving the Secret Service agents led the military to start its own investigation, a U.S. official told CNN. Officials said they are based at Eglin Air Force Base, in Florida's Panhandle, and belong to the 7th Special Forces Group, which operates mostly in Central and South America. All the military personnel are being investigated for heavy drinking and use of prostitutes while in Colombia as part of the support team for Obama's visit, the official said. They are not likely to redeploy until the matter is resolved, other military officials said, though no formal order bars their deployment. The military investigation could end with no action, administrative action like a letter of reprimand or a recommendation to proceed with criminal charges, officials said. U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Virginia, has called for Mark Sullivan, the head of the Secret Service, to be among those who lose their jobs in the wake of the incident. ""There's only so many strikes you get, in baseball it's three,"" said Forbes, a senior member of the House Armed Serves Committee, referencing a 2009 security breach in which a Virginia couple crashed Obama's first White House state dinner, as well as agency's apparent overspending in that same year. However, King and others came to the defense of Sullivan, who has directed the Secret Service since May 2006 and been with the agency since 1983. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said he believes the agency's director is taking ""serious action,"" noting polygraph tests have been administered. And House Oversight Committee Chairman Rep. Darrell Issa, R-California, said he has a high level of confidence in Sullivan. Sullivan has told subordinates to use ""all tools available"" to conduct the investigation, one source said. The Secret Service agents and officers being investigated range in experience from relative newcomers to nearly 20-year veterans, two government officials with knowledge of the investigation said Monday. Each agent was offered an opportunity to take a polygraph test, according to a U.S. official. Some of the agents and military personnel maintain they didn't know the women were prostitutes, the official said. Even so, King said, ""It was totally wrong to take a foreign national back to a hotel when the president is about to arrive."" While soliciting prostitution is in most cases legal for adults in Colombia, it is considered a breach of the Secret Service's conduct code, government sources said. Military law also bars service members from patronizing prostitutes, engaging in conduct unbecoming an officer or, for enlisted personnel, conduct ""prejudicial to good order and discipline.""

"(CNN) -- They came from all across America: from Connecticut to Florida to Illinois, and many points in between. One had been in the Marines for nearly four and a half years, another for just a few months. Many served in Afghanistan, earning numerous honors before making it safely back home to the United States. On Wednesday, the military released the names of the seven Marines killed Monday night during a training exercise at Hawthorne Army Depot in western Nevada. They were all under 26. 7 killed in explosion at Nevada Marine training exercise . ""Our hearts, thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of our fallen angels,"" said Lt. Col. Andrew J. McNulty, commanding officer of the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. Those killed are: . Lance Cpl. David P. Fenn II: The Polk City, Florida, resident joined the Marines in June 2010 and was promoted nine months later. In that time, he'd deployed to Afghanistan where, among other honors, he earned a NATO Medal-ISAF Afghanistan and Afghanistan Campaign Medal. The mortarman was 20. ""Remember him as he was and as who he could have been and in the future,"" retired Camp Lejeune Marine George Barrows told CNN affiliate WITN. ""After all, he did it for our country."" Pfc. Joshua M. Martino: The 19-year-old from Clearfield, Pennsylvania, was a mortarman in the regiment. He joined the Marines in July, but already had earned the National Defense Service Medal and Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. Friends said Martino wanted to be a Marine all his life and joined the Corps right out of high school, affiliate WTAJ reported. ""I not only salute him in his passing, but I salute everyone ... in the armed forces today,"" said Cmdr. David Gralla of Veterans of Foreign Wars Post 813. Martino was engaged to his high school sweetheart and the couple were planning a wedding next year. Lance Cpl. Roger W. Muchnick Jr.: The 23-year-old hailed from the southwestern Connecticut town of Fairfield and ended up in Afghanistan as a mortarman with the 1st Battalion, 9th Marine Regiment. Like his fallen colleagues, he amassed a host of honors in his military career, such as the Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal and Sea Service Deployment Ribbon. Muchnick played sports at Eastern Connecticut State University before leaving school early to enlist. The decision wasn't a surprise to his lacrosse coach Justin Axel. ""I knew that he would thrive in that situation. He was that kid that would do everything you tell him to do, was great at following orders,"" Axel told affiliate WTNH. ""He was just one of those tough, hard-nosed kids that you'd just dream of having."" Cpl. Aaron J. Ripperda: At 26, he was the most senior of those killed Tuesday, both in his age and rank. The Madison, Illinois, resident joined the Marine Corps in September 2008, with his latest promotion to corporal coming in April 2011. Among his numerous honors were a Navy Unit Commendation and a Humanitarian Service Medal. Ripperda was just nine weeks away from ending his career in the military, after serving tours in Haiti and Afghanistan, his father, Kurt Ripperda, told affiliate KSDK. His parents were relived once he came back to the States, figuring he was safer closer to home. ""No matter if it would've been nine weeks or three years, it just hurts,"" Ripperda said. ""He was so close to getting out, but he was a good Marine. I was proud of him."" Ripperda loved cooking and sailing, and had plans to buy a new boat once he moved back home. Lance Cpl. Joshua C. Taylor: The Marietta, Ohio, resident, 21, was a teenager when he joined the Marines in June 2010. In 2011, the decorated mortarman was promoted to lance corporal, the same year he deployed to Afghanistan as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. His fiancee Abby Malone said the couple was planning to marry in May, according to affiliate WOOD-TV. Malone told the station she is ""more proud (of Taylor) than I can say."" Lance Cpl. Mason J. Vanderwork: Another mortarman with a host of medals to his name, the 21-year-old was from Hickory, North Carolina. He, too, served in Afghanistan and accumulated a number of medals along the way. At St. Stephens High School where he graduated in 2010, his former football coach Chip Watts said he was like a son to him and a tough team player. ""Pure tenacity. Work ethic. Desire,"" Watts told affiliate WSOC. ""Whatever the kid did, he did it 100 miles per hour."" Vanderwork leaves behind a wife. Lance Cpl. William T. Wild IV: In October 2010, the Anne Arundel, Maryland, resident joined the Marines. By December 2011, the mortarman had earned his new rank, and he also earned a number of recognitions, such as the Combat Action Ribbon and Global War on Terrorism Expeditionary Medal. He was 21. Authorities still don't know how the men died. McNulty said Wednesday they know only that the ""60 mm mortar system failed to function as designed,"" and are trying to find out why. Hawthorne Army Depot, about 140 miles southeast of Reno, is used for storing ammunition and weapon stocks awaiting demilitarization. The facility also provides high-desert training facilities for military units. The night after the incident, the Marines issued a statement saying that 60 mm mortar rounds and tubes used to fire them are being pulled pending the investigation. In addition to the dead, eight service members were injured in the explosion. The Wednesday night update from the Marines indicates that a Navy Corpsman remains ""very seriously injured,"" while five others are ""seriously injured."" Two Marines have been treated for minor injuries and released. CNN's Barbara Starr, Mike Mount and Tina Burnside contributed to this report.","Those killed hail from seven states .

"Levignac, France (CNN) -- It's an unusual setting for one of the world's most modern aircraft -- a provincial French village with 19th-century charm, every two weeks Levignac hosts a nocturnal procession of huge A380 parts on their way to the Airbus assembly line. Raising his hands as high and wide as he can, local resident Jerry Ridge explains what it's like to see the convoy of six individual parts that, when put together, form the largest passenger aircraft in the world. ""When you see it in pieces, coming through a little village on the back of trucks, it looks bigger than the complete item,"" he says. ""It's taller than the buildings."" Watch video: Tracking the A380 night convoy . Five years since its first commercial flight the double-decker plane is now a regular sight at most hub airports around the world. Accommodating such a big bird wasn't easy -- runways and taxiways were widened and strengthened, along with specially designed aircraft stands and extra baggage belts to cope with the suitcases of more than 500 passengers on a single flight. See also: 'Superjumbo' A380 marks five years in the sky . Different parts of the plane are made all over Europe -- the rear fuselage in Hamburg, Germany, the wings in Broughton, near Liverpool, England, the forward and middle fuselages in Saint Nazaire, France and the horizontal tailplane in Cadiz, Spain. Everything apart from the tail fin and the nose cone is far too big to fly to the final assembly line at the Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, southern France. So Airbus created a whole new method to move them. These key components are loaded onto specially designed ships that sail 2,000km in total across the continent to the delivery point at a harbor in Paulliac, 600km south of Paris. The aeronautical cargo is then transported on modified barges along the Garonne River to Langon, where they are transferred onto trucks. It's a journey that takes four days including the night convoy to the finish line. The component parts sit in sequence at a holding area in L'Isle Jourdain 11km away, where a team briefing is held for the 53-man crew, 31 vehicles and 18 security-staff motorcade before the final leg of this mammoth journey squeezing through the little village of Levignac. I could tell you that the A380 is 18 meters wider and 5 meters longer than a Boeing 747, that it has a wingspan of 79.8 meters and its tailfin alone is 24 meters high. But no matter what the numbers say or how often you see an A380 on the ground or in the air, the most impressive way to get some perspective on the size and scale of the Superjumbo is to see it out of context -- unpainted, just its green protective coating, in individual parts, moving down the main street of a small French village, towering over roof tops and tree tops alike. It's a fortnightly ritual for the locals and a midnight treat for tourists -- and with the manufacturing serial number in full view it takes planespotting to a whole new level. The convoy I joined -- MSN 121 -- will become a British Airways A380. This was a paradise for aviation geeks, to be face to face with the Superjumbo. First to appear were each of the wings. Laying on their sides, they looked like prehistoric creatures emerging from the darkness, stepping into the flood of light from the lamposts that lined the street. Next up, the horizontal tailplane, then the three sections of the fuselage. Slow and steady, in single file the parts crawl by. It's over far too quickly. For first-timers like me, it was hard to stop watching one part of the plane and focus my attention on another. It was a natural reaction to want to walk along with the convoy, escorting the parts. Seeing the plane in its basic primary form, it felt like everyone gathered along Rue de la Republique was a part of the production process. At 2am, six pieces, all in a row, are safely delivered outside the Airbus hangar to wait their turn to be put together, just like a kit of parts. The first stage is the structural assembly where the sections are fitted, including the landing gear. Each part requires precision and patience; it takes 13,000 rivets to join the three sections of the fuselage together and 4,000 rivets just to attach the wings to the body. Watch video: Inside the A380 assembly line . The easiest way to identify who the planes belong to is by looking at the tail fins -- the only part at this stage that's painted in the airline livery. Then there is the next stage of the production process where the onboard equipment is installed and the engines fitted. The planes then make it outside in one piece for pressure and fuel testing. Each airline has its own ""build manager"" to inspect and support every stage of the assembly. ""We're looking at the looming, all the ducting before the bulk heads go in,"" said James Lewis, who started as a maintenance engineer with British Airways 25 years ago. ""It's very detailed in some places but it's also a general walk around using the eye, a torch if you need to."" He added: ""To see an aircraft start in its composite building blocks and slowly turn into an aircraft, it's a fascinating experience and a learning experience."" After the fuel testing is complete, the plane was due to fly to Hamburg to be painted and fitted with the cabin interiors. This whole process takes eight months from final assembly until the keys are handed over and delivered. Once one plane is ticked off the list, they start the process all over again. Walking through the hangar of the final assembly line and catching a glimpse of one of the 1,500 engineers that work there, it's almost as if the Airbus headquarters was in Lilliput, taking care of the plane that Gulliver could have traveled in.","Every fortnight huge A380 parts driven through the streets of Levignac .

"Rome (CNN) -- The Vatican geared up for the inauguration of the pope on Tuesday, a ceremony ushering in a new era for the Roman Catholic Church. Anticipation mounted among the faithful across the globe awaiting a joyous and solemn chapter of Christian history. St. Peter's Square will bustle with tourists, locals and pilgrims during the official Mass to install Francis as the bishop of Rome. The choice of day to anoint him as the holy father of the Roman Catholic Church carries a rich symbolism: It is the day that Catholics celebrate the Feast of St. Joseph to honor Jesus' father on Earth, the carpenter Joseph. It also happens to be Father's Day in Italy. Foreign dignitaries, royalty, heads of state, and representatives of other religions will attend. Security will be on the alert as hymns, chants and prayers fill the square. The pope, who plans to deliver his homily in Italian, isn't expected to religiously stay within a script. He will have prepared comments but, his spokesmen say, he might diverge because he likes to be spontaneous. That trait will endear him to the flock but keep security on its toes. ""The very competent security forces with the pope are there with him. They've been watching him. They'll adapt to his own movements and they will do their best to adapt to new situations,"" Vatican deputy spokesman the Rev. Thomas Rosica told reporters. ""They're concerned about the protection of the pope, but also the protection of the people that are there as well. And this is something brand new, and they will adapt to that because they're extremely competent and very well prepared,"" he said. All this comes during one of the busiest times of the year on the Christian calendar. Less than a week away is Palm Sunday, the holiday that kicks off Holy Week, which culminates in Easter celebrations. Dignitaries stream in . Vatican spokesmen briefing reporters Monday stress that dignitaries are welcome to attend the inauguration but, by tradition, they don't receive a specific invitation. U.S. Vice President Joe Biden is to lead the U.S. presidential delegation for the Mass, the White House said Friday, with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi also among the party. On Friday, House Speaker John Boehner, a Republican, said he will send a separate bipartisan congressional delegation. Those delegations are among scores from nations and international organizations traveling to the Vatican, led by heads of states and governments. Delegations will be on hand from Italy and the pope's native Argentina. There will be other groups from the Americas, including Brazil, Chile, Mexico and Canada, and European nations such as Holland, Belgium and Germany. Representatives from across Christianity -- Eastern and Western -- are expected to be present. Members of other religions, including Judaism, Islam, Buddhism, Sikhism and Jainism, are to be at the inauguration. One bit of controversy has emerged: Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe, reviled for his human rights abuses, has arrived. He is under a European Union travel ban, but he can skirt that because he entered Italy on religious grounds. In power for decades, Mugabe visited the Vatican in 2011 for the beatification of the late Pope John Paul II. He attended that pope's funeral in 2005. Argentine president visits . Pope Francis met at the Vatican on Monday with the leader of his native Argentina, President Cristina Fernandez de Kirchner, a figure with whom Francis has clashed publicly over social issues. When he was archbishop of Buenos Aires, Francis disagreed with the Argentine government's position on same-sex marriage and free distribution of contraceptives. But Fernandez sent a letter congratulating him as he assumed his new role. The pope's meeting with Fernandez, which also included lunch, is a sign he's trying to put the past behind him. The pope will bring his Argentine heritage with him to the Vatican, adopting the same motto and the coat of arms he used in Buenos Aires. After the meeting, Fernandez said she asked the pope to intervene in the dispute between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the Falkland Islands and help the nations spark a dialogue. The two countries went to war over the territory in 1982 after the then-military government in Argentina landed troops on the islands. For more than a year, renewed rhetoric between Argentina and the United Kingdom over the islands has escalated to a fever pitch, with both sides accusing each other of colonialism. Last week, residents of the South Atlantic islands overwhelmingly voted to remain under British rule. Fernandez said she and Francis also discussed human trafficking and slavery. Vatican: Argentine claims defamatory . The Vatican has sought to quell controversy over Pope Francis' conduct during Argentina's so-called Dirty War from 1976 to 1983, amid accusations that he could have done more to protect two Jesuit priests who were kidnapped. The accusations resurfaced after the Argentine cardinal's unexpected election to the papacy last week. A book by investigative reporter Horacio Verbitsky accuses Francis, who was then Jorge Mario Bergoglio and was head of the country's Jesuit order, of deliberately failing to protect the two priests, Orlando Yorio and Francisco Jalics, when they were seized by the navy. They were found alive five months later. But the Rev. Federico Lombardi, the Vatican's lead spokesman, dismissed the claims as false and defamatory. ""The campaign against Bergoglio is well-known and goes back to many years ago. It was promoted by a defamatory publication,"" he said at a Vatican news conference Friday. ""This was never a concrete or credible accusation in his regard. He was questioned by an Argentinian court as someone aware of the situation but never as a defendant. He has, in documented form, denied any accusations,"" Lombardi said. ""Instead, there have been many declarations demonstrating how much Bergoglio did to protect many persons at the time of the military dictatorship,"" he said. His role after he became bishop of Buenos Aires in asking for forgiveness for the church for not having done enough at the time of the dictatorship ""is also well-known,"" Lombardi said. Bergoglio's journey to top of the church . First Sunday as pope . Thousands of Catholics waving flags from around the world packed St. Peter's Square on Sunday to hear Pope Francis deliver his inaugural Angelus. The new pontiff gave the noon blessing from the papal apartment window, speaking to more than 200,000 worshippers in the square four days after his election as pope. ""Dear brothers and sisters, good morning,"" he said in Italian, drawing cheers from the crowd. During the 15-minute address, he focused on forgiveness. ""Never forget this: The Lord never tires of forgiving us,"" he said. ""Have you thought about the patience that God has with each of us?"" He made the historic address after celebrating Mass at Sant'Anna parish in Vatican City earlier Sunday. Catholics: 5 ways for Francis to move forward . Reforms to come? In his first week as pontiff, Francis has enjoyed global fanfare as the first Latin American pope and the first Jesuit pope in modern times. In just his first few days, he has prompted speculation that he may bring in wider changes. While he decided the heads of the various Vatican offices will keep their jobs for now, he's not making any definitive appointments, the Vatican said Saturday. CNN Vatican analyst John Allen, who's also a correspondent for the National Catholic Reporter, said this is the first clear signal that he may be serious about reform. ""It's customary for new popes to swiftly reconfirm the department heads who lose their positions when the previous pontificate ends, and then take his time about bringing in his team,"" Allen said. ""The fact that Francis has not followed that path may suggest that significant personnel moves will come sooner rather than later."" Francis wants ""a certain period for reflection, prayer and dialogue before (making) any definitive nomination or confirmation,"" a Vatican statement said. Pope Francis breaks with tradition .

"Washington (CNN) -- When the topic turned to contraception and reproductive rights at CNN's debate in Arizona on Wednesday, Newt Gingrich went on the attack, saying that in 2008 ""not once did anybody in the elite media ask why Barack Obama voted in favor of legalizing infanticide."" It's a striking claim, and he's not the only Republican presidential candidate making it. Speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition Forum last March, Rick Santorum said, ""any child born prematurely, according to the president, in his own words, can be killed."" Both Gingrich and Santorum are referring to ""born alive"" bills that were brought up in the Illinois Legislature in 2001, 2002, and 2003 when Obama was a state senator. The intent of the legislation was to protect any infant who survived a botched abortion by requiring the doctor to give life-saving care. In part, the bill said ""a live child born as a result of an abortion shall be fully recognized as a human person and accorded immediate protection under the law."" Then-state Sen. Obama opposed the legislation because he said it would undermine the legal protections given to abortions under Roe v. Wade. On the state Senate floor, Obama said he believed courts would eventually overturn the legislation since it would ""essentially bar abortions, because the equal protection clause does not allow somebody to kill a child."" He added that Illinois already had a 1975 state law that protected the life of an infant that survived a botched abortion, if doctors determined the infant could survive. When the legislation came up for a vote in 2001 and 2002, Obama once voted ""present"" -- essentially a non-vote -- and once voted against it. In 2002, Congress was also writing a ""Born Alive"" bill. Obama said several times he would support that version of the bill because it contained a clause that would protect the legal standing of Roe v. Wade. Opponents of abortion rights, such as the National Right to Life Committee, challenged his explanation, saying the 2003 version of the Illinois law contained language virtually identical to the federal law, so by his own logic he should have supported it. He didn't. The new legislation never made it out of the Health and Human Services Committee that he chaired. In 2008, Christian Broadcast Network Correspondent and CNN contributor David Brody asked then-presidential candidate Obama about the allegations that he supported infanticide. Obama responded by saying, ""here's a situation where folks are lying. I have said repeatedly that I would have been completely in, fully in support of the federal bill that everybody supported -- which was to say that you should provide assistance to any infant that was born -- even if it was as a consequence of an induced abortion. That was not the bill that was presented at the state level."" After researching and analyzing the issue, two independent fact-checking groups, Politifact and Factcheck.org . both determined it's not true to claim Obama supported legislation that said ""any child born prematurely ... can be killed."" In fact, the Pulitzer Prize-winning Politifact rated the Santorum's assertion ""Pants on fire"" -- its rating that a statement is ""not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim."" Then there's the part of Gingrich's statement that the ""elite media"" ignored the story in 2008. In fact, a search on Nexis shows at least eight times when it was mentioned or discussed in detail on CNN during the 2008 campaign. Here are two specific examples: . -- On June 30, 2008, Carol Costello examined the evidence for ""The Situation Room"" with this introduction: ""Some are calling Barack Obama a baby-killer because of a bill he voted down while he was in the Illinois state Senate. It was called the Born-alive Infant Protection Act and it's come back to haunt him. But is it fair?"" That piece was followed by political analysis on the same topic from Bill Bennett and James Carville. -- In his August 2008 interview, David Brody asked then-presidential candidate Obama: ""The born-alive infant protection act. I got to tell you, that's the one thing I get a lot of e-mails about and it's just not just from evangelicals -- it's about Catholics, Protestants -- they're trying to understand it because there was some literature put out by the National Right to Life Committee. And they're basically saying they felt like you misrepresented your position on that bill.""","GOP presidential hopeful Newt Gingrich says Obama voted for infanticide .
Gingrich also said the media won't ask him about the issue .
Rick Santorum has made similar charges recently .
CNN and other research shows both charges are wrong ."
"Washington (CNN) -- In the final hours before $85 billion in widely disliked spending cuts began to take effect Friday, top political leaders did virtually nothing to defuse Washington's latest self-imposed fiscal crisis. Democrats blamed Republicans, Republicans blamed Democrats, and both sides prepared for the next showdown -- a possible government shutdown on March 27. Here are the highlights of Friday's partisan skirmish: . Last minute White House meeting achieves nothing . President Barack Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, House Speaker John Boehner, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi huddled behind closed doors for less than an hour Friday morning. As expected, the meeting didn't accomplish anything. The gathering was ""subdued"" a GOP congressional aide told CNN. Democrats insisted once again that the cuts could be avoided if only Republicans would compromise and agree to higher taxes on the rich. ""None of this is necessary,"" Obama told reporters after the meeting. ""It's happening because (of) a choice that Republicans in Congress have made. They've allowed these cuts to happen because they refuse to budge on closing a single wasteful (tax) loophole to help reduce the deficit."" The country ""will get through this,"" he insisted. But ""it's just dumb."" Republicans once again ruled out new taxes, and said they had already done their part. ""The (GOP-controlled) House shouldn't have to pass a third bill before the (Democratic-controlled) Senate does anything,"" said Boehner, referring to Republican-drafted legislation that died in the last Congress. ""The House has laid out a plan to avoid the (current cuts). ... This discussion about revenue, in my view, is over. It's about taking on the spending problem here in Washington."" The current pending budget cuts are the result of an ongoing partisan impasse whose origins stem from an August 2011 agreement to increase the debt ceiling. Obama: I don't have horns and I'm not a Jedi . ""I recognize that it is very hard for Republican leaders to be perceived as making concessions to me,"" Obama told reporters. ""Sometimes I reflect -- is there something else I can do to make these guys ... not to paint horns on my head?"" The president bemoaned his inability to force GOP leaders to cut a deal. ""I know that this has been some of the conventional wisdom that's been floating around Washington ... that I should, somehow, you know, do a Jedi mind meld with these folks and convince them to do what's right,"" Obama said. ""If there was a secret way to (convince them), I would have tried it. I would have done it. What I can do is, I can make the best possible argument. And I can offer concessions, and I can offer compromise."" Boehner: House will try to avoid a government shutdown . The next big date on the fiscal calendar is March 27, the day Washington's spending authority expires for the rest of the current fiscal year. Congress has to pass a bill extending federal spending authority or the government will shut down. ""The House is going to move a (legislation) next week to fund the government past March 27,"" Boehner said. ""I hope the Senate will follow suit. ... I'm hopeful that we won't have to deal with the threat of a government shutdown while we're dealing with the (spending cuts) at the same time."" And speaking of that shutdown ... As March 27 approaches, lawmakers will continue to fight over the $85 billion in spending cuts. Should a new government funding bill include the current cuts? Should it substitute another $85 billion in cuts? Should greater flexibility be provided to the Pentagon or other departments as they implement the cuts? With less than a month to go before the shutdown deadline, these questions are already dividing legislators and could derail coming shutdown talks. Democrats have so far largely resisted the notion of greater flexibility in the implementation of the cuts. On Thursday, they rejected a Senate Republican bill that would have given Obama more flexibility in deciding which programs to slice. Among other things, Democrats worry that would let the GOP off the hook while placing responsibility for the cuts clearly on the president's shoulders. Critics in both parties consider the idea an abdication of Congress's power of the purse. ""Flexibility is not a substitute for money,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Barbara Mikulski, D-Maryland, told CNN's Ted Barrett on Friday. Flexibility ""would be like being on the Titanic. We've hit the iceberg, and flexibility says what deck to you want to be on as you sink? Do you want to be near the kitchen? Do you want to be near the band?"" ""What we want is a solution with money,"" Mikulski. ""Not a sham solution with the illusion of a management approach."" McConnell: No more taxes or back-room deals . ""Over the coming weeks, we'll have the opportunity to ensure funding is at the level we promised while working on solutions for making spending reductions more intelligently than the president's across-the-board cuts,"" the Senate minority leader said in a written statement Friday afternoon. ""But I want to make clear that any solutions will be done through the regular order, with input from both sides of the aisle in public debate. I will not be part of any back-room deal and I will absolutely not agree to increase taxes,"" he added. Pelosi: House GOP fears ""marketplace of ideas"" House Democrats ""have a proposal that would have been better"" than the current cuts, Pelosi told reporters on Capitol Hill. The proposal ""has a revenue piece,"" she noted, but Democrats ""haven't been able to bring it up. We've ... tried three times in the last two months."" ""The Republicans, I don't know what they're afraid of,"" the California Democrat said. ""This is the marketplace of ideas. Are they afraid that some of their members might vote for it?"" Federal employees brace for furloughs . Several FBI employees told CNN they received letters Thursday warning of expected cuts and furloughs due to the imminent cuts. Prospective furlough notices also went out to 115,000 Justice Department employees, according to a senior official at the department. Finally, if you're planning to visit the Capitol soon ... Prepare for longer lines. The following message went out Friday from Congress's Office of Sergeant at Arms: . The imminent spending cuts ""will require modifying points of access for members, congressional staff and guests to the U.S. Capitol Complex. ""At this time it is anticipated that the U.S. Capitol Police will be required to close some entrance doors and exterior checkpoints, and either suspend or modify the hours of operation for some of the U.S. Capitol Complex posts located inside and outside of the (Capitol Visitor Center) and office buildings. These changes will most likely take place within the next two weeks, and the congressional community will be notified in a timely manner before implementation.""

"(CNN) -- Tiger Woods tuned up perfectly for the forthcoming Masters with a two-shot victory at the WGC Championship in Florida as he edged closer to overhauling the world No. 1 Rory McIlroy. The 14-time major champion started the final round at the Blue Monster course at Doral with a four-shot lead and never looked like relinquishing it, despite the best efforts of Phil Mickelson and Steve Stricker. The world No. 2 dropped a shot on the final hole to finish on 19-under-par, two clear of Stricker, who had given Woods a few putting tips before the tournament started and might now wish he hadn't. It was Woods' seventh triumph in the Cadillac Championship, his 17th World Golf Championship and his 76th PGA Tour title. ""I played well this week,"" Woods said at the trophy presentation. ""Thank you to Steve for the putting lesson. It was one of those weeks where I felt pretty good about how I was playing. I made some putts and pretty much got rolling."" The 2010 U.S. Open champion Graeme McDowell started the final round in second but endured a testing afternoon, dropping back to 14-under as he finished in third alongside Phil Mickelson, Spaniard Sergio Garcia and Australian Adam Scott. Woods carded three birdies in his first ten holes but dropped two shots on the closing holes, including on the final hole. Yet he looks to have regained some of his best form with the first major tournament of the year -- The Masters at Augusta -- just round the corner. McIlroy, who caused controversy by walking off the course during last week's Honda Classic was back to his best form, firing a seven-under-par round of 65 as he charged up the leaderboard to finish in a tie for eighth place. ""I was pretty down about my game coming into this week,"" McIlroy told the PGA Tour's official website. ""A day like today felt like a long way away if I'm honest."" ""A few days like I've played, it does my confidence a world of good. I probably wear my heart on my sleeve a bit with my golf. If I have a bad round, it's sort of like the end of the world, but if I play a good one, I'm happy again. ""I always think when I'm playing bad that it's further away than it is,"" McIlroy added. ""That's just where I have to stay patient and let whatever happens, happen, and know that if I put in the hard work, that the results will bear fruit; whether that's sooner or later, it doesn't really matter.""","Tiger Woods wins the World Golf Championship title by two shots in Florida .

"(CNN) -- The urban dictionary defines ""cheech"" as a verb used among physicians in training that refers to the act of ordering every conceivable radiological and laboratory test for a patient, often to diagnose a condition that once diagnosed is untreatable. Thirty years ago, the macabre joke during my three-month stint as an intern in the medical ICU was first cheech, then death. I remember sitting at the bedside of a frail, older woman with dementia dying of septic shock. A litany of subspecialists had rounded earlier in the day, but no one said what was so obvious. She was dying. Instead, I sat at her bedside at 4:30 a.m. watching the sun rise over Narragansett Bay, increasing vasopressors to try to maintain her blood pressure. Instead of being surrounded by her family and loved ones, the only person at her bedside was an exhausted intern who had never met the woman in bed No. 2 until the night before. This was simply wrong. Why were we rearranging the deck chairs on the Titanic instead of ensuring that her death was peaceful and that she was surrounded by her family? Intensive Care Units save some patients and play an important role in our health care system. But the overarching concern is, ""Are we talking to frail, older patients and their families at the right time about when to stop (or avoid) ICU care and recurrent hospitalizations?"" Decisions about hospitalizations and ICU admission must weigh the quality vs. the quantity of life. Opinion: End-of-life planning eases suffering . These decisions must reflect a patient's informed wishes and goals for care, be based on what the patient and/or family understand about the medical condition -- their hopes and goals -- and educate them about the prognosis and treatment options to arrive at a care plan that honors realistic patient goals of care. Our research published in the February 8 edition of JAMA finds that hospice is now part of mainstream medical care, with nearly half of older Medicare beneficiaries receiving hospice services. However, that's only half the story. More than a quarter (28.4%) of these people had the benefit of hospice for three days or less, and nearly half (40.3%) were in an ICU immediately before. Indeed, contrasting end of life care in 2000 vs. 2009, in spite of a doubling of hospice use, we found more ICU care, more repeat hospitalizations and more patient transfers from hospital to another health care setting in the last three days of life. Does this pattern of care reflect the informed wishes of dying patients and their families? Our research does not provide the answer to this important question. But it is something we really need to know. On the face of it, our research findings should not be surprising. You get what you pay for. All the financial incentives in fee-for-service Medicare are aligned to induce more hospitalizations, more ICU care and late hospice referrals. As we try to reform our health care system to provide care that is patient centered and care that improves the health of our population, we need to do a better job of paying for quality rather than simply paying for another day in the ICU, particularly if it does not change the inevitable. Yet during the debate over health-care reform, a proposal to pay health-care providers for advance care planning was eliminated from the legislation based on the mistaken argument that promoting shared decision making with the goals of honoring patient wishes was equivalent to creating a ""death panel."" The key is that decisions be based upon discussions that weigh the quantity vs. the quality of life reflect informed patient preferences. The evidence to date suggests we are falling short of that goal. We've previously shown that 11.6% of family members felt pressured by a physician to put a feeding tube in a dying patient with advanced dementia, and about 10% reported that no one discussed that decision with them. A recent study of two ICUs that differed on the aggressiveness of care provided found contrasting decision-making styles: a futility based decision-making process where one talks to the patient only when death is certain in the aggressive ICU vs. a shared decision making model where physicians work with patients and families early in the ICU stay to arrive at a decision that is consistent with the patient's prognosis and goals of care in the ICU. We must have publicly reported data on the degree in which our health care system delivers on the promise of patient centered care -- that health care providers are informing patients and their families of the expected prognosis and treatment options, helping them in making these difficult decisions, and that patients are provided the right care at the right time, in the right place, and consistent with their informed wishes. We must hold our health care system accountable to the goal that medical decisions should reflect patient informed goals and values. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Joan M. Teno .","Joan Teno asks: Why do doctors continue to test and treat patients who are clearly dying?
She says instead they should be helping very sick patients weigh quality of life against quantity .
Teno: Hospice care doubles, but patients still in ICU until last 3 days of life. Do they want this?
Teno: Intervention lucrative for medical industry; this wars with patient-centered end-of-life care ."
"(CNN) -- Despite public perception, Iceland is hot. Sure, summer temperatures rarely rise above 13 C, but the small Nordic country has become a holiday superstar. Tourism has nearly doubled since 2000 (last year saw over 565,000 visitors), but while tourism has helped jolt Iceland out of recession, the country is courting a different demographic: it wants to woo business travelers. ""The tourism numbers fluctuate a lot, depending on the season, whereas corporate travel is distributed more evenly throughout the year,"" explains Thorsteinn Orn Gudmundsson, managing director of Meet in Reykjavik, the official convention bureau for the Icelandic capital. Hoping to tap into the events market, Reykjavik has set to work building its conference infrastructure. Perhaps the most prominent display of the city's corporate courtship is the newly built Harpa, a combo concert hall and convention center that opened May 2011. A joint effort by Icelandic-Danish artist Olafur Eliasson, Henning Larsen Architects and Batteriio Architects, Harpa is one of the most cutting-edge conference centers in the world. Its glittery, disco-like facade is meant to mimic the country's stunning glacial surrounds, while the interior evokes Iceland's lava fields. See also: Best business hotels 2012 . The acoustics, however, are the real star. Each of Harpa's four concert halls has a large overhead reflector system and acoustics control chambers, all of which are intended to produce a superior sound. ""We may be a small country, but we've got big ideas,"" says Karitas Kjartansdottir, Harpa's conference director. Though the venue is in its early days, and Kjartansdottir reckons it takes up to five years to market a new conference hall, Harpa has already booked some big gigs. ""If you're a manager, and you're risk-adverse, you might be hesitant to send several hundred of your best employees overseas somewhere, especially if you're not fully sure of how evolved the infrastructure is in that place,"" says Gudmundsson. ""People who have been here already know how state-of-the art our technology and infrastructure are, but there are some who have no idea, and they might think of Iceland as primitive, in a sense. Our focus right now is in trying to shift that perception."" See also: Iceland bouncing back on tourism boom . Another advantage that managers may not be privy to is the convenience of Iceland's location. Though it may seem like a distant land, the country is a mere three-hour flight from central Europe, and five hours from many North American destinations. Meet in Reykjavik has adopted the slogan ""meet in the middle,"" a reference to both the country's handy midway coordinates, and to the historic Reykjavik Summit, where former U.S. President Ronald Reagan met with General Secretary of the Soviet Union's Communist Party Mikhail Gorbachev in 1986, to negotiate arms control. ""It will be a long time before we get another meeting as prominent as the Reykjavik Summit,"" says Gudmundsson. ""Though one could say that it was the starting point for Iceland becoming a destination for meetings."" The national carrier, Icelandair, has also been a major factor in developing the country's connectivity with the world. Over the last few years it has developed its flight network, increasing both the number and frequency of direct routes. ""We have great connections from the [United] States to Iceland, and that puts us in a strong market position,"" notes Kjartansdottir. Watch video: Richard Quest's presidential tour of Iceland . But perhaps the country's greatest sell is its natural beauty. The Blue Lagoon -- the most visited sight in Iceland -- is also set up for meetings and conferences. There are board rooms and theaters that can accommodate up to 90 guests, and which overlook the lava fields, glaciers, waterfalls and the lagoon itself. Some companies even hold meetings in the midst of the steaming waters. ""The Blue Lagoon brings more energy to business groups, and makes corporate events more fun and productive,"" notes Magnea Guomundsdottir, the director of public relations for Blue Lagoon Iceland. Gudmundsson attended one such meeting while a management consultant at McKinsey & Company. ""There were 30 of us standing in the blue water, watching the snow come from the sky while discussing the values of the company,"" said Gudmundsson. ""It literally blew the socks off everybody there. ""Six weeks earlier, we'd had an event in New York. It was very nice, and memorable, but nothing close to how distinctive the Blue Lagoon was."" As if the setting wasn't unique enough, Blue Lagoon has also arranged DJs, circuses and modern dance performers for corporate events. ""It's in keeping with the spirit of the setting,"" notes Guomundsdottir.","Iceland is trying to attract more business travelers .

"Washington (CNN) -- By now, many Americans are used to getting random e-mails allegedly from ""friends"" with weird-looking links embedded in them, or what looks like SPAM from fake companies inviting you to click on a link to reset your password. But what you may not know is that shady Internet practices could be playing a dangerous role in international cyber warfare. From China to Russia to the Middle East to African countries in transition after the Arab Spring, attacks launched from overseas against American companies and private citizens have now become a primary fear of the U.S. government, according to the annual intelligence community's worldwide threat assessment released Tuesday. ""Threats are more diverse, interconnected and viral than at any time in history,"" Director of National Intelligence James Clapper said in testimony prepared for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence. Report: Cyberattacks a key threat to U.S. national security . ""Attacks, which might involve cyber and financial weapons, can be deniable and unattributable,"" Clapper said for Tuesday's hearing. ""Destruction can be invisible, latent and progressive."" The Senate committee is talking with Clapper and other administration officials this week in an annual round of hearings on international threat assessments. Cyber security firm Mandiant recently linked China to cyber espionage and attempts to steal American trade secrets. ""We see two sets of attackers in broad groups. We have intruders who are nation states who conduct espionage. They're going after as you mentioned trade secrets, information that they can use to improve their own companies back home. And we also see criminal groups,"" Richard Bejtlich, chief security officer of Mandiant, told Soledad O'Brien on CNN on Monday. National Security Adviser Tom Donilon also sounded the alarm in his remarks on Monday to The Asia Society in New York. ""Increasingly, U.S. businesses are speaking out about their serious concerns about sophisticated, targeted theft of confidential business information and proprietary technologies through cyber intrusions emanating from China on an unprecedented scale,"" he said. ""The international community cannot afford to tolerate such activity from any country. As the president said in the State of the Union, we will take action to protect our economy against cyber-threats,"" he said. The White House signaled that cybersecurity would be a top priority during President Barack Obama's second term. On the same day as the State of the Union address last month, Obama signed an executive order aimed at quelling cyberespionage against U.S. government agencies and American businesses. The order also seeks to shore up defenses of the critical infrastructure vulnerable to cyberattacks. Obama administration takes on hackers stealing trade secrets . ""We know hackers steal people's identities and infiltrate private e-mail. We know foreign countries and companies swipe our corporate secrets,"" Obama said during the State of the Union address. ""Now our enemies are also seeking the ability to sabotage our power grid, our financial institutions, and our air traffic control systems,"" he said. The president stressed the urgency of swift action. ""We cannot look back years from now and wonder why we did nothing in the face of real threats to our security and our economy,"" he said. For instance, that link in an e-mail from a trusted friend could really disguise a malicious file or ""bot"" intended to steal your passwords, log all your keystrokes or ultimately put your bank accounts, personal details and other private information in the hands of cyber criminals or foreign governments. Now imagine that happening thousands of times a day, every day of the year, all across the country. The effect could put broader networks and secure data at risk. Foreign governments can also monitor some data networks, cloud computing and wireless transmissions in efforts to steal sensitive information. The United States is seeking a more muscular response to the growing threat from foreign hackers interested in obtaining business trade secrets. Cloud threats and firewalls: Internet guru demystifies cyber security . The response, seen in a 150-page report unveiled by Attorney General Eric Holder and other leading government officials earlier this year, includes pledges by the Justice Department and FBI to crack down on hacking, a guide for corporations vulnerable to attacks on how to beef up their own security, and a proposal to better coordinate efforts with U.S. allies to prosecute foreign hackers. ""In this time of economic recovery, this work is more important than it has ever been before,"" Holder said. ""I am pleased to report we are fighting back more aggressively and collaboratively than ever before."" Major banks hit with biggest cyberattacks in history . Facebook, Microsoft, the New York Times and other media companies have all faced cyber attacks in recent years. So have financial institutions like Bank of America, US Bancorp, HSBC, JP Morgan Chase, Mastercard, PNC, SunTrust and Wells Fargo. Companies like Goldman Sachs and Citigroup recently sounded the alarm with shareholders about the increased risk of cyberattacks. The Obama administration specficially pointed the finger at China on Monday. Donilon said that Beijing must ""take serious steps"" to fight hacking of U.S tech networks. He said the U.S. government wants China to recognize ""the urgency and scope"" of the cybersecurity issue and ""the risk it poses"" to international trade and to the ""reputation of Chinese industry and to our overall relations."" Legislation aimed at regulating how businesses report and address cyber attacks failed in the Senate last year amid GOP and business lobby resistance. But the business community may now be coming around to working a bit more closely with the government in the interest of improving security. During a Senate hearing last week, lawmakers listened to the business community and government officials' concerns. During a similar series of committee hearings this week, lawmakers will examine more ideas on the topic.

"(EW) -- ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" (CinemaScore: B+) picked up significantly over the weekend, earning a $28 million opening on 3,525 screens. This is better than it was tracking on Friday, likely due to the fact that families waited until the weekend to see the film. Still, it's nowhere near what the movie needed to take in on its opening weekend, and will likely not even come close to making up for its almost $200 million budget. Review: 'Jack the Giant Slayer' To put a little perspective on this March weekend, the same timeframe last year had an animated opening and an R-rated party movie that fared much better than ""Jack"" and ""21 and Over"" (in third place): ""Dr. Seuss' The Lorax"" opened at $70.2 million and ""Project X"" at $21.1 million. As the first $100 million movie of 2013, ""Identity Thief"" made $9.7 million in its fourth weekend in theaters. Down 31 percent from last weekend, Universal's Jason Bateman and Melissa McCarthy comedy picked up eight new theaters. If it wasn't obvious that ""Identity Thief"" was a runaway success, the R-rated movie has already made three times its opening weekend. Paul Feig and company should be anxious to find out if the McCarthy/Sandra Bullock vehicle ""The Heat"" will boast similar profits when it opens in June. Review: '21 and Over' ""21 and Over"" (CinemaScore: B) had a $9 million opening weekend in 2,771 locations, with a $3,248 per screen average. Directed by first time directors Jon Lucas and Scott Moore, Relativity's $13 million party movie should be able to make back its budget, but it is surely disappointing that the film came in at less than half of ""Project X's"" opening weekend. ""Project X"" dropped off 47 percent in its second weekend, and, if ""21 and Over"" follows that trend, it will at least slide past the $13 million mark. Although ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" (CinemaScore: C-) was tracking pretty similarly to ""21 and Over"" on Friday, the poorly rated horror film lost a little steam over the weekend, bringing in only $8 million in 2,700 locations, with a $2,974 location average. The first ""Last Exorcism"" opened in late August 2010 at $20.4 million. Though it only ended up making twice that in its lifetime, with a $1.8 million budget, it's no wonder CBS Films thought that they might be able to repeat Lionsgate's success. So far, ""Part II"" has made up its $5 million production budget, and surpassed the $3 million that CBS Films spent acquiring it, but considering the poor reviews and similarly bleak CinemaScore, it's very unlikely that it will hit the margins of the first film. Rounding out the top five is Summit Entertainment's ""Snitch."" Down 41 percent in its second weekend, the $7.7 million weekend brings the Dwayne Johnson action flick to $24.4 million total. 1. ""Jack the Giant Slayer"" -- $28 million . 2. ""Identity Thief""-- $9.7 million . 3. ""21 and Over"" -- $9 million . 4. ""The Last Exorcism Part II"" -- $8 million . 5. ""Snitch"" -- $7.7 million . Park Chan-wook's R-rated thriller ""Stoker"" also opened in seven theaters for a $158,822 weekend, with a $22,698 location average. This is the first English language film for the South Korean director (""Old Boy""), and was co-produced by Ridley Scott, Tony Scott, and Michael Costigan.

"(CNN) -- HBO and the ""Game of Thrones"" producers have apologized for comments made on the season one DVD about a prosthetic head that looks suspiciously like our nation's 43rd President. In the commentary, show creators David Benioff and D.B. Weiss admit that George W. Bush's likeness appears in a scene in which King Joffrey shows Sansa Stark her dead dad's head on a stick. (Check it out on io9.com). The alleged Dubya noggin is the last one on the left â€” and he's sporting some pretty bad hair. ""It's not a choice, not a political statement!"" one of the writers say during the commentary. ""We just had to use what heads we had around."" Once news of the Bush head hit the internet, HBO released this statement: ""We were deeply dismayed to see this and find it unacceptable, disrespectful and in very bad taste. We made this clear to the executive producers of the series who apologized immediately for this inadvertent careless mistake. We are sorry this happened and will have it removed from any future DVD production."" The producing duo released their own, too: ""We use a lot of prosthetic body parts on the show: heads, arms, etc. We can't afford to have these all made from scratch, especially in scenes where we need a lot of them, so we rent them in bulk. After the scene was already shot, someone pointed out that one of the heads looked like George W. Bush. In the DVD commentary, we mentioned this, though we should not have. We meant no disrespect to the former President and apologize if anything we said or did suggested otherwise.""

"London, England (CNN) -- Eight years ago Justine Laymond was told by doctors to say a final goodbye to her family -- she had, they said, only hours left to live before her lungs would stop working and her body shut down. But this July Laymond defied her medical fate and made history by becoming the first double lung transplant survivor ever to have raced across an ocean. The 39-year-old from England, who has suffered nearly 20 lung collapses due to a condition known as Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), is part of a multinational crew taking part in the bi-annual Clipper Round the World Yacht Race -- the only sailing race in the world where crews are made up by ordinary people, many with little or no sailing experience. This year more than 500 people from 41 countries are taking part in the 40,000-mile relay race, which started in August 2011 and is set to finish later this month. The line-up this year consists of ten identical 68-foot long yachts -- all sponsored by different cities around the world -- that are currently on the eighth and final leg of the race. Laymond decided to get involved in the competition when she heard that the crew representing Edinburgh would have a relay team of transplant patients, surgeons and specialist nurses on its boat to raise awareness for organ transplantation -- something that saved her life six years ago. ""For years I suffered from chest pains but no one knew what was really wrong with me,"" said Laymond, who despite her pains led a very active life -- working at a gym and teaching children street dance in her spare time. ""When I was 31 I suffered a double lung collapse and was rushed to hospital. They referred me to a specialist who found hundreds and hundreds of cysts in my lungs and I finally got diagnosed with (this) rare condition,"" she said. The doctors told Laymond that, with no functioning right lung and only 30% capacity remaining in her left lung, she would be unable to have kids and that she would die if she didn't have a transplant. ""My world fell to pieces,"" said Laymond, whose condition quickly deteriorated after she was diagnosed and left her in a three-week-long coma fighting for her life. She refers to this period as her ""dark days,"" as she was slipping in and out of consciousness while on life support. In 2006, after 16 months of waiting and three false alarms, she finally received a new set of lungs in a 10 hour transplant operation, and she hasn't looked back since. ""I'm definitely a bit of a fighter. Because I had been in a coma I had to learn how to walk again and when I finally got out of hospital I decided to set myself daily challenges -- to do something different and to push my boundaries and defy the odds,"" said Laymond, who confessed that to date none of her challenges have been as difficult, or is ever likely to be as challenging as the Clipper race. More from Mainsail: Solo adventurer says she's relieved to be back on land . Indeed, it was far from plain sailing for Laymond's crew on board the ""Edinburgh Inspiring Capital"" yacht, whose Atlantic Ocean crossing was a grueling affair plagued by tropical storms and rough seas. With a weak immune system and only 60% lung capacity it was a mammoth challenge for Laymond: ""Towards the end I thought I couldn't do it. The cold got into my lungs and I got so weak that I thought I might have to be airlifted off and go to hospital to get some fluids and real food. But the skipper and the rest of my team were so fantastic and supportive that I managed to hang in there."" Her skipper Piers Dudin was impressed by Laymond's determination and spirit: ""Justine has done incredibly well, she had a tough race physically and she really grew with the race. ""What she is representing is hugely empowering to people with similar conditions and she has certainly showed that anyone can do it. I think the whole team can be proud of what she has achieved,"" he added. The Clipper Round the World Race is the brainchild of Robin Knox-Johnston, the first person to ever sail solo nonstop around the world -- a feat which he managed to do in a journey that lasted 312 days between 1968 and 1969. Watch: Fastest man on water . He said he came up with the idea for the unique race while he was exploring Greenland in 1995 with British mountaineer Chris Bonington: ""Chris was telling me how much it cost him to climb Mount Everest and I thought to myself 'that's a lot of money' and then I asked myself what is the sailing equivalent of climbing the world's biggest mountain and the answer was obvious, it's the circumnavigation. ""So I did some calculations on the back of a cigarette packet right there and then and I thought 'actually I could do a round the world race for half of what it costs to climb Mount Everest.'"" The aim of the competition is to give everyone, regardless of sailing experience, the opportunity to experience the exhilaration of ocean racing. The first race took place in 1996; it consisted of eight boats and saw 300 people take part in the relay competition. See also: The enduring allure of tall ships . Since 1996 almost 3,000 people have competed in seven editions of the race, and although anyone can apply to take part, all selected crew members still have to pay a fee to join. It costs Â£10,000 (around $15500) to do one leg and Â£43,000 (around $67,000) to do the whole circumnavigation including four weeks of training. According to the organizers some people have sold their houses and given up their jobs to be able to join the challenge, others have managed to participate without ""any money in the bank"" by doing fundraising events. The only requirement is that you are over 18 and willing to work in a team and able to motivate yourself and others. Motivate others is exactly what Justine Laymond hopes her story will do: ""I have learned that life is too short -- so if you have a dream you just have to go out there and do it. ""Hopefully my story will inspire more people to become organ donors. It only takes minutes to register and it can save up to seven people's lives. It saved mine. I'm here because I've been given the gift of life and without that donation it would never have been possible.""","Justine Laymond is the first double lung transplant survivor to have raced across an ocean .

"(CNN) -- ""Hello, my name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" Not a day goes by without someone asking Mandy Patinkin to say this famous and oft-repeated line. Despite Patinkin's numerous other accomplishments and recent hit turn on the Showtime drama ""Homeland,"" ""The Princess Bride"" is what people want to hear from him, ""and I never let them down,"" he told CNN. ""I get asked for that line, too,"" laughed Chris Sarandon, who played the dastardly Prince Humperdinck. ""They always want me to quote Mandy, or Wally Shawn: 'Inconceivable!' And once in a great while, I get a plea for 'I'm swamped.'"" ""A girl once showed me a tattoo of 'As you wish' on the back of her neck,"" said Cary Elwes, who played Westley. Such is the love -- some might even say true love -- for ""The Princess Bride."" The New York Film Festival celebrated the film's 25th anniversary (and release on Blu-Ray) on Tuesday with a special screening and cast reunion at Lincoln Center. En route to the event from LAX, even Billy Crystal was told, ""Have fun storming the castle"" (in reference to his cameo as Miracle Max) when he showed his boarding pass. It's a line, by the way, that an army sergeant told Elwes that he tells his men when they leave the barracks to rile up the infantry. 'Princess Bride' star: Every woman wants to hear 'As you wish' ""So many different generations find this movie not only appealing, but have such a strong affection for it,"" Sarandon said. ""It's a film people see when they're young, and then they watch it with their own kids. Someone even told me that they hired an actor, got him ordained online, and had him perform a marriage ceremony exactly the way it is in the movie."" (""Mawwiage is what bwings us together..."") Along with director Rob Reiner and author and screenwriter William Goldman, the ""Princess Bride"" cast -- including Robin Wright (Buttercup), Wallace Shawn (Vizzini) and Carol Kane (Valerie) -- reminisced about the making of the film, which they hadn't seen with an audience since before its release, and a small private screening for friends at that, since it didn't have a big premiere back in 1987. The Cliffs of Insanity? Made of rubber. The Rodents of Unusual Size? Played by little people, one with a talent for scurrying, one with a talent for lumbering, and one with a talent for getting arrested. And that sword fight between Inigo and Westley as the Dread Pirate Roberts? Done for real. ""Our greatest pride is that there's not a single stunt man doing a single move except for the flip in the air,"" Patinkin said. ""I trained with an Olympic fencing coach for two months with just my left hand -- it's like ballet first position, second position -- and then Cary and I trained for four more months, so six months together, for 10 hours a day. Except for the flip, we did everything."" Elwes revealed another talent that in addition to sword fighting cinched him the job in the first place -- a dead-on Bill Cosby imitation. ""I had no idea if he had a sense of humor, but he looked the part,"" Reiner said. ""And when he did schtick, I was surprised. Wow, this beautiful looking kid, he looks like Douglas Fairbanks, and he does schtick!"" Elwes demonstrated his sense of humor at last December's Jason Reitman-organized stage reading of ""The Princess Bride,"" when he played the part of Prince Humperdinck instead of Westley, allowing that role to go to Paul Rudd. ""And I did a dreadful job,"" Elwes told CNN, laughing. ""I was awful. It was so hard stepping into those shoes, and it was so weird because Paul Rudd was being me and doing a better job than me, two chairs down. So it was a very surreal experience."" (Upon hearing this, Sarandon deadpanned, ""Oh, I've got to talk to Cary now. I want to hear what he did with me, if he screwed me over or not."") Even though ""The Princess Bride"" is ""a perfect movie,"" as Kane called it, Goldman has been toying around with the idea of a follow-up, which is mentioned in the later editions of the novel, some of which feature a sample chapter of ""Buttercup's Baby."" ""See, I told him he should call it 'Humperdinck's Revenge!'"" Sarandon joked. ""I smell a sequel!"" Elwes laughed. The plot involves the kidnapping of Buttercup and Westley's daughter, Waverly, and at first it was a fiction (along with other faux-dramas Goldman created as part of the ""Bride""-verse), but then it started to become a reality of sorts. ""I've been trying to write it,"" Goldman admitted, ""and it's a total failure. I was looking at it today before coming [to the reunion]. All I can say is that I would love some day to have written it."" If Goldman can finish the book, and if the book were to ever be turned into a movie, count on most of the original cast members to make cameos. ""If they call me, I'm there,"" Patinkin promised. ""Ask me!"" Sarandon begged. ""I would probably find myself begging to do a cameo in anything Goldman wrote,"" Kane said. ""And I would riff all day long [with Billy Crystal] if he would let me."" Crystal noted that he had several unused lines that ended up on the cutting room floor that he'd be happy to trot out, such as, ""Don't bother me, sonny. I had a bad day. I found my nephew with a sheep."" (Would that be as memorable? He's not worried, because there's no danger of any sequel tarnishing the original anytime soon.) ""I'm in something that is really important, that is so beautifully made, and it's all about the right things,"" he told the audience. ""What better life is that for the life of a movie? That's the 'As you wish' for the movie.""

"(EW.com) -- In the ""Incredible Burt Wonderstone,"" Steve Carell and Steve Buscemi play world-famous Las Vegas magicians. Carell wears spangled red velvet and a poufy wig that makes him look like Barry Manilow, and Buscemi sports an even more unreal-looking lanky mop. Each night, they kick off their act by doing a smiley little dance to ''Abracadabra,'' that cheesy-catchy Steve Miller Band classic. This trademark fanfare places the two somewhere between Siegfried & Roy and the head-bopping Butabi brothers from ""Saturday Night Live,"" and I chuckled, with mild pleasure, at the dopey kitschiness of it. I assumed (or at least hoped) that the dance would be a warm-up for the much bigger laughs to come. Carell's Burt Wonderstone and Buscemi's Anton Marvelton have been partners ever since they were childhood geeks who began inventing their own magic tricks back in the early '80s. They've been doing their sold-out show at Bally's for so long now that they're sick of it, and sick of each other, too. Burt, off stage, is a toxic diva who makes groupies sign contracts and treats Anton like an indentured servant. One night, the two are working with a brand-new assistant, Jane (Olivia Wilde), performing a classic trick that requires Burt and Jane to huddle inside a box, which Anton jabs with swords. Squeezed inside the compartment, Burt asks Jane to sleep with him that night, and when she turns him down, he throws a hissy fit. It should be an over-the-top funny moment, as Carell lashes out with a faux-aristocratic hauteur. He's going for a Will Ferrell meltdown, yet there's something a little too controlled about Carell's bombastic nuttiness. The effect isn't hilariously insane. Once again, it's just kind of mild. 'Burt Wonderstone': Box office magic? ""Burt Wonderstone"" seems to be reaching for the tone of early Farrelly brothers movies like Kingpin, and also for the madcap hostility of Zoolander. Yet in too many scenes, the comedy doesn't quite ignite. The movie rarely climbs out of the chuckle zone, except for a few times when Jim Carrey is on screen as Burt and Anton's rival, a stringy-haired, tattooed street magician who specializes in cable-TV stunts that represent the new era: He's like Criss Angel as a Zen pain freak. The gleam of madness in Carrey's eye finds a perfect home in this role, which has him upping the ante on how far he'll go (holding in his urine for 12 days, spending a night on hot coals), all as a way to bedazzle jaded audiences. 'Glee': Idina Menzel to return . He beats Burt and Anton at their own game, and their act starts to fall apart. And so, in a way, does the movie. Instead of getting wilder, it turns earnest and mushy, as Burt, humbled by failure, starts performing at a retirement home, where he befriends Rance Holloway (Alan Arkin), the cranky magician whose VHS tape first inspired him as a kid. Burt Wonderstone has a real affection for the world of illusionists, a showbiz demimonde it treats with simultaneous snark and awe. Yet the movie itself is too cautious and unimaginative to bring off what a great magic trick â€” or comedy â€” should do: make us laugh out loud with surprise. B- .

"(CNN) -- Turkey's foreign minister continued Saturday to press for an apology from Israel over its forces killing nine Turkish activists, a day before the boat that set off the row between the two countries is scheduled to arrive in Istanbul. Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu criticized Israel for not reciprocating his country's efforts to remedy relations, despite Turkey's ""wish to reconcile with Israel,"" according to the state-run Anadolu news agency. ""We are having difficulty, when we don't receive the same will from the other side,"" he said. ""If our friendship with Israel is going to continue, an apology and compensation are the only possible ways for it."" Turkey was once Israel's strongest ally among Muslim nations, but the relationship between the two nations has been chilly since May 31, when Israeli forces intercepted an aid flotilla headed to Gaza from Turkey. Violence broke out, and nine Turkish activists were killed. Tens of thousands of people are expected Sunday to greet the boat at the center of the controversy, the Mavi Marmara, when it arrives Sunday in Istanbul, according to a press release from Foundation for Human Rights and Freedoms and Humanitarian Relief. Israel has maintained that its troops used force on the activists only after they were attacked by those on board one boat. But passengers on board insist Israeli troops fired on them without provocation. On Saturday, Davutoglu said that Tel Aviv's attempts to lay blame were unfounded. ""Turkish citizens were killed in international waters,"" he told reporters, according to the Anadolu report. ""Nothing can cover this fact. Turkey cannot be blamed."" In September, the U.N. Human Rights Council concluded that Israeli forces committed serious violations of international law in the mid-sea interception. The 56-page report described the circumstances of the deaths of ""at least six of the passengers"" as being ""consistent with ... an arbitrary and summary execution."" Officials from Israel and Turkey met earlier this month in Geneva, Switzerland, in an attempt to reduce tensions. That meeting came days after Turkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan sent two firefighting planes to Israel to help combat a deadly wildfire, according to a Turkish foreign ministry official. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu publicly thanked Erdogan, then called him to thank him again, the official said. While on the telephone, Netanyahu said he hoped the two countries could discuss the state of their relationship in a different context.","Turkey's minister says Israel is not reciprocating his nation's efforts to remedy relations .

"(CNN) -- Serving as a timely reminder to delegates convening for the Rio +20 Earth Summit, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has published its latest Red List detailing the ongoing threats to biodiversity on the planet. The IUCN assessed a total of 63,837 plant and animal species around the globe which revealed 19,817 of that number are currently threatened with extinction, with 3,947 described as ""critically endangered"" -- the final classification prior to extinction. A further 5,766 are ""endangered,"" while more than 10,000 species are listed as ""vulnerable."" ""Sustainability is a matter of life and death for people on the planet. A sustainable future cannot be achieved without conserving biological diversity ... not only for nature itself but also for all seven billion people who depend on it,"" Julia Marton-Lefevre, IUCN director general, said in a statement. ""(The latest report) is a clarion call to world leaders gathering in Rio to secure the web of life,"" Marton-Lefevre added. See Also: Can Rio +20 solve world's environmental problems? Amphibious creatures like frogs, toads and newts are the most endangered group with 41% facing extinction. A quarter of all mammals and 13% of bird species are heading towards a similar fate. Ocean biodiversity is continuing its decline with a third of all reef-building corals threatened by extinction which could cause potentially catastrophic consequences for humans. More than 275 million people are dependent on coral reefs for food, coastal protection and their livelihoods, according to the IUCN. The reef fishing industry is worth $6.8 billion annually but overfishing is now affecting more than half the world's reefs. ""The services and economic value that species provide are irreplaceable and essential to our well being,"" Jon Paul RodrÃ­guez, deputy chair, IUCN Species Survival Commission, said in a statement. ""Unless we live within the limits set by nature, and manage our natural resources sustainably, more and more species will be driven towards extinction. If we ignore our responsibility we will compromise our own survival,"" he added. Plants also continue to face severe threats. Two species (Acalypha dikuluwensis and Basananthe cupricola) were officially declared extinct in 2012 and 30% of conifers are under threat. ""Recent work on plant assessments suggests that around one in five plants are threatened with extinction,"" says professor Stephen Hopper, director (CEO and chief scientist), Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, England. ""Three quarters of the world's population depends directly on plants for their primary health care. Eighty percent of our calorie intake comes from 12 plant species. If we care about the food we eat, and the medicines we use, we must act to conserve our medicinal plants and our crop wild relatives,"" he added. Paul Smith, Head of the Millennium Seed Bank at the Royal Botanic Gardens says that every plant extinction makes it more challenging for humans to adapt to change. ""You look at all the big environmental problems -- food security, water scarcity, energy, climate change mitigation and adaptation -- the fact is we need to adapt and innovate,"" Smith said. ""We have always adapted and innovated -- 10,000 years ago we innovated with agriculture. But we can only innovate if we have access to a full range of plant diversity,"" he added. The seed bank at Kew, the largest of its kind in the world, currently stores 11% (around 31,000 specimens) of the world's plant species. Smith says the plant extinctions that have occurred since the first Earth Summit in 1992 have all been entirely avoidable. ""There is no technological reason why a plant species should become extinct. To collect and preserve an entire species which we can keep in the seed bank here for 200 years costs about Â£2,000,"" he said. Smith says the failures to forge ahead with environmental action in recent years have been down to lack of political will. ""I think because people are incapable of thinking in the long term -- particularly politicians and our leaders. There hasn't been either priority or resource given to these tasks,"" he said. But he remains upbeat about Rio +20. ""You've always got to be optimistic,"" Smith said. ""The problem with any consensual approach is that it takes a very long time. It has become highly politicized and dominated by lawyers. That's the problem with any multilateral consensual system."" But others, like Jim Leape, director general of WWF is deeply concerned that Rio +20 talks will stall. In a statement released by WWF on Tuesday, Leape said the summit is ""doomed to ridicule"" unless world leaders ""get serious about sustainable development."" Leape laments the revisions to the Rio +20 negotiating text made by diplomats over recent days which have swapped ""weak words for toothless language,"" he argues. ""They've added some positive actions around oceans protection. But the text has lots of words that 'commit' parties to nothing -- such as 'commit to promote' and 'commit to systematically consider,'"" Leape said. ""World leaders 'recognized' problems 20 years ago, and they've done little about them since. How long are we going to accept 'we'll look into it' as a solution?"" he added.","Latest snapshot of threats to animal and plant species published by international conservation group .

CEO Marissa Mayer, and Princeton professor and former top State Department official Anne-Marie Slaughter -- have taken turns at the center of the debate, Mayer recently when she declared an end to employee flextime in favor of face time, angering many women (and men), who considered the move a step back. The myth of balancing motherhood and a successful career . Slaughter, in an Atlantic article last year, wrote of backing away from her State Department job over mom-guilt and then criticized Sandberg for signaling in her popular video talks ""more than a note of reproach"" to such a retreat, while she encouraged women to stay in the game, come what may. The new book by Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, may have caused the biggest stir. It's a well-researched overview of problems women face navigating what she calls the career ""jungle gym,"" and exhorts women to embrace their power, live up to their highest ambitions, and own the work/life choices made along the way. Some women -- many who haven't read it -- have slammed it as elitist or as placing the burden of change too much on women and not enough on workplaces. I've been an activist for women for decades, so I'm thrilled that a top female corporate leader has declared her intention to energize a new wave of women's advancement. But the inevitable backlash is a troubling diversion. For one thing, why is this a women's discussion? Who ever judged a man for not being home to cook his child's dinner or wipe her nose? Or opting not to take paternity leave? Why this incessant drumbeat about women and the work/life choices they make? Why should only women shoulder the double burden of work and family responsibilities? And why hasn't the workplace caught up to the needs of the women who have been flooding into it for years now? One answer, according to a research paper last year from a team headed by University of North Carolina's Sreedhari Desai, may be resistance of married men with stay-at-home wives. The team's findings included, for example, that ""employed husbands in traditional and neo-traditional marriages, compared to those in modern marriages, tend to (a) view the presence of women in the workplace unfavorably, (b) perceive that organizations with larger numbers of female employees are operating less smoothly, (c) find organizations with female leaders as relatively unattractive, and (d) deny, more frequently, qualified female employees opportunities for promotion."" Organizational structures of workplaces were, after all, designed originally by men, for men with wives at home caring for the kids, the old folks, and the house. And culturally ingrained ""implicit bias"" influences both men and women to value men's traditional leadership roles more than women's. Opinion: Working moms, don't try to be perfect at home . But such attitudes are neither realistic nor sustainable. In today's world of two-earner families, businesses that don't shift to accommodate to families' needs -- such as paid sick leave flexible enough to permit caring for children and elders -- are not only dysfunctional, they lose their women workers. Recognizing this brain drain and its negative impact on business, nearly 550 CEOs from major companies globally have signed the Women's Empowerment Principles, a collaboration between U.N. Women and the U.N. Global Compact (its tagline: ""Equality means business""). I recently attended a convocation of this group, which includes such giants as Ernst & Young, Deloitte, Calvert, and Accenture, and heard male and female executives passionately asserting that inclusion of women is not just the right thing to do, it is a strategic business imperative. If women are so strategically important -- and graduating from college and pouring into the job market at a higher rate than men -- shouldn't they be in a position to demand a more family-friendly workplace? Consider: If women had been in charge of creating the organizational structures for the last few hundred years, wouldn't we all have figured out how to care for the kids and elders without losing the value of half the population's intelligence in the workplace? It is time for women to stand up to seize this moment, as sure to wreak havoc with prevailing norms as the Second Wave feminism that inspired me in the 1960s to morph from real West Texas housewife (I mean really real -- three kids by age 20 and no employable skills) to college student to volunteer women's activist to a full-out career. Let's stop dancing on the head of a pin to someone else's argument about who is more righteous: the woman who opts out to care for children, or the one who leans in to leadership in the corporate world, or the one who dodges both options to create a part-time alternative. Conflicts like this keep women fighting each other rather than using our collective power to push for systemic changes in the workplace, changes that can open up choices for us and generations to come. Work and family: How do you it work? Creating them isn't easy, but the steps are simple. I call it Sister Courage, and like-minded men are welcome to join. First, be a sister at work -- make alliances with people who share your concerns. Don't let yourself be isolated. Reach out to give help and ask for help when you need it. Second, have the courage to raise issues. Engage even when it's hard. That doesn't mean being unkind. It does mean not backing off. It means defining your own terms -- for flextime, for pay raises, for promotion, for creating a practical, productive work situation where everyone wins. As a military strategist once told his advisers, when they told him they couldn't possibly win on the battlefield as mapped: ""Draw a bigger map."" And negotiation expert Victoria Pynchon says women do benefit most from negotiation when they operate from a straightforward position they define and stick to. And third, put sister and courage together into a purposeful strategy and keep moving until you've reached the goal. Don't backslide in the pursuit of parity goals. As Linda Hirshman illustrated in ""Victory: The Triumphant Gay Revolution,"" the gay rights movement has changed attitudes toward same-sex couples by applying these movement-building principles. If women quit arguing and work toward systemic changes together, we can retool the workplace for a successful 21st century. If we don't? Twenty years from now we may still be bemoaning the fact that even though women earn 57% of college degrees, hold 85% of the consumer purchasing purse, are 54% of voters and half the workplace, they're stuck at under one-fifth of congressional, corporate board, and top management seats. Social movements by nature are messy and do not go in straight lines. Striving together, not just to adapt ourselves, but to change the system is the key to a fair, just, and thriving society for women and men.

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Malaysian author Tan Tweng Eng has won this year's Man Asian Literary Prize for ""The Garden of Evening Mists,"" set in the aftermath of the Japanese occupation of Malaysia. ""This comes as a huge shock. It's such a strong list that I'm speechless,"" said Tan, who beat four other shortlisted books to win the $30,000 prize. The shortlist included some big names -- Nobel laureate Orhan Pamuk, ""The Silent House"", Indian poet and writer Jeet Thayil, ""Narcopolis"", Jiromi Kawakami, ""The Briefcase"" and Musharraf Ali Farooqi, ""Between Clay and Dust"". Pamuk was the only one not to attend the formal black-tie dinner at Hong Kong's Peninsula Hotel. British journalist and literary critic Maya Jaggi, who chaired the panel of judges, championed the book for working on so many levels and with so many themes while also being a tale driven by mystery. ""Why is this woman the sole survivor of a Japanese labor camp? What happened to her sister? What happened to the landscape artist who was the gardener to the emperor?"" she said. Also on the judging panel, novelist Vikram Chandra drew attention to the formal structuring of the novel that mirrors the novel's central metaphor. ""It's elegant in the same way that the garden is and its shape finally gives you a vision of the entire thing,"" he said. Tan grew up in Malaysia and studied law, going on to specialize in property law at one of Kuala Lumpur's leading law firms. But he had nurtured a secret desire to write since his childhood and in his early 30s took the opportunity for a ""gap year"" -- studying for a Masters at Cape Town University. He wrote his first book, ""The Gift of Rain,"" while doing his Masters. That book went on to be longlisted for the Man Booker Prize. After a year of book festivals and promoting the book he settled down to write ""The Garden"" and spent years crafting the novel, revising the text and moving the scenes about until he felt he had achieved the right balance. ""When I was writing the book I suddenly realized that gardening is like creative writing -- the pruning, deciding where to put your sentence, your comma, where to begin the next paragraph,"" the 40-year-old said. ""The Garden of Evening Mists"" was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize 2012, as was ""Narcopolis"". Tan jokingly referred to Thayil as his ""travel companion"" as they have attended many of the same festivals and prize presentations over the last six months. Attending the formal prize dinner for the last time were representatives from the Man Group that has sponsored the prize for the last six years. Chair of the prize's board of directors, Professor David Parker, said that a number of parties had expressed interest in sponsoring the prize and they were talking seriously to three. ""All I can say at the moment is that the response has been encouraging and we are encouraged,"" said Parker, adding that he hopes to make an announcement at the end of April. The prize was initially awarded for an as yet unpublished book, but after three years was changed to make it the prize for the best novel of the year by an Asian writer that is either written in English or translated into English. The revised format means that people can read the long and shortlists ahead of the prize, and booksellers see a spike in sales for the listed books, especially the winner. Matt Steele, manager of retail operations at Dymocks, said: ""The profile of the prize grows each year and we expect that at some point it will reach the same levels as the Man Booker Prize."" This year saw a record 108 entries, up from 90 last year and 54 in 2010. ""We're now into the ballpark of the Man Booker in terms of number of entries,"" said Parker. Last year's winner, 'Please Look After Mom"" by South Korean writer Shin Kyung-sook, has sold more than two million copies worldwide. The prize has inspired a ""shadow jury"" of four book bloggers -- two in Europe and two in Australia -- who review and blog about the books and announce their winner two days before the real jury does. Last year the Shadow Man Asian Literary Prize picked ""Please Look After Mom"" and this year they chose ""Narcopolis"" as their favorite.","Tan Tweng Eng wins literary prize for the novel ""The Garden of Evening Mists""

"BATH, England (CNN) -- Lurking among the orchards and misty meadows of South Somerset, England, is a quiet, green energy revolution. Many old watermills in south west England are being used to create local energy. The tranquil, rural area is most famous for agriculture -- particularly apples and cider -- and along its many rivers are a series of historic watermills, which were for centuries used to grind corn and other cereals for local farmers. But now their waterwheels are being put to a new use: generating clean, green power. ""The mill was falling into disrepair,"" says Brian Shingler, owner of Gants Mill. ""It had been in the family for over 50 years and I knew I was looking at a wasted resource; so I decided to do something about it. ""It was partly altruistic -- we wanted to do our bit to save the planet. We also knew that the only way electricity prices could go was up, and it made good business sense as well."" Shingler wasn't the only local interested in the new potential of watermills. He got together with five others and in 2001 they formed the South Somerset Hydropower Group with the help of the local council. Together they applied for grants to help fund work to convert their Mills -- including $130,000 from the UK's Energy Saving Trust. So far ten sites in the area have joined the scheme -- installing machinery and clearing and repairing weirs and leaks. Six mills are already online delivering approximately 164,688 units (kilowatt hours) of green electricity each year. The power is used locally, with any surplus sold on to the national grid. In some cases it isn't the first time mills have been used this way, as many had already generated power historically. ""From about 1870 through to the Second World War a lot of mills on English rivers were used to supply electricity to large country houses,"" says Shingler. ""It was usually a 24-volt system used to charge up batteries. But once the national grid took off, and that got out into all the villages, everything changed and generating your own power worked out more expensive and the mills fell out of use."" But now those days are coming back. With rising power prices, and a growing awareness of green issues, watermills are becoming increasingly attractive as low carbon community power sources. Already the South Somerset project is being replicated in nearby Mendip at sites along the River Frome, as well as in Dorset and Devon, with other projects setting up around the country, including Yore Mill in Yorkshire. David and Ann Kiely bought that site in 1993, hoping to run it as a tourist attraction. ""When we bought Yore Mill it was with the intention of diversifying our farming business,"" he says. ""At one time it housed an historic collection of Victorian horse drawn vehicles, but visitor numbers had steadily declined and the collection sold."" But after having their pig farming business devastated by the foot and mouth crisis in 2001, the couple hit on the idea of using the mill to generate power. ""When we thought it through, the idea made a lot of sense,"" says Kiely. ""The turbines were here in situ, we have a powerful water source and we can generate 55KW per hour per day - enough to supply 100 households. We've had tremendous local support for the project too."" The couple received a Government grant of $79,000 to help complete the work. The major obstacle to more conversions is that high start-up costs can deter potential conversions. ""It is definitely getting harder,"" says Shingler. ""There are less and less grants available at the moment. But that could all change. The price of electricity is getting higher all the time. We now get about 10 or 12 pence a unit; we used to get 2 pence. You're looking at under ten years to make a profit -- less if prices keep going up steeply. ""The real issue is how much of the infrastructure you already have, and how much engineering you need to do; how much equipment you have to buy."" But all UK renewable energy producers were given a boost recently when the British Government announced on October 16 that it intended introducing a ""feed in tariff"" guaranteeing rates for renewably produced electricity. The tariff is intended to kick-start the renewable energy sector by paying an above market rate for power that is then slowly reduced year-on-year. The British Government hopes it will reward early-adopters and stimulate production. When Germany did the same thing in 1999 it led to a huge growth in renewable energy production -- they currently have ten times as much wind power as the UK, and 200 times more installed solar energy. ""Watermills will probably only ever supply two or three per cent of the nation's need,"" says Shingler. ""Simply because of the finite number of suitable rivers. Generating power like this is quite a thirsty business and you need a very good flow."" But generating power locally increases efficiencies by reducing wastage from transporting electricity long distances, and stimulates regional economies. ""In the end the economics come down to the size of the river,"" says Shingler. ""Some people run small operations that rely on filling up a pond and then releasing when it's full, but the payback on a small site takes much longer."" But whatever the obstacles, Shingler has no regrets: ""It's all been quite fun, really -- especially when the cheque arrives!""","UK watermills undergoing a renaissance thanks to appeal of green energy .

"(CNN) -- The charm of Ventotene is apparent the moment you spot it from the boat transporting you to its shores. Sitting there like a lonely sponge cake protruding from the surface of a clear blue plate, the island's sheer size -- or lack thereof -- promises something not only special but personal. Ventotene lies in the Tyrrhenian Sea just west of the mainland region of Campania. Arriving on this tiny island off the west coast of Italy, you enter the port built into the side of the volcanic island by the ancient Romans and only recently developed and expanded to provide for heavier traffic. The fishermen's boats lining the harbor along with pizza and scuba shops give the island that quintessential small-town Italian feel. To get to the center of the island, you walk the winding ramp to Piazza Castello, where the town hall sits. Grab a cappuccino at one of the two cafes there, which moonlight as restaurants during peak season from May to October. If caffeine doesn't satisfy you, grab a bottle of wine at one of the local alimentari and sit in the park right off the square for  majestic views of the small uninhabited island of Santo Stefano (used to detain Mussolini's adversaries during his rule). Part of the cluster of islands known as the Pontines, Ventotene -- which gets its name from the Italian word for wind, ""vento"" -- lies in the Tyrrhenian Sea just west of the mainland region of Campania. It occupies less than a square mile, and its history dates to the Roman Empire, when emperors such as Augustus and Tiberius found the island's isolation perfect for banished troublemakers. During World War II, it was used as a listening post by a German garrison before being captured by the Allies in 1943. The island also has a rich literary history. It is thought that Homer intended this to be the spot where Ulysses confronted the sirens during his long journey home. John Steinbeck wrote about the 1943 U.S. raid on Ventotene while he was a war correspondent for the New York Herald Tribune. During the day, you can sunbathe at one of the three main beaches. Cala Nave is the preferred choice for its accessibility, black volcanic sand and rock outcroppings that make for ideal basking in the intense Mediterranean sun. Ventotene has become a scuba diving destination because of its lush and mostly undisturbed aquatic life. There are several scuba-diving schools on the island, one of which was erected in the late '70s and is the oldest scuba academy in the whole of Italy. Private and group lessons start at 100 euros. Ventotene's size makes it perfect for simply setting off and exploring. Walking is cheap, and traversing the bright landscape -- which often doubles as cliff's edge because of the island's narrow width -- is rewarding not only for its brilliantly colored vegetation but also for its panoramic views and lack of entry fee. Lower on the island, discover the chiseled rocks pockmarked by saline (little crevices used to collect fresh salt water in ancient times) and the sea caves down by the port where transparent pools often act as windows into the astonishing marine life that surrounds the island. If you're looking for something a little less nature-oriented, there are two museums. Villa Giulia -- which is less enclosed museum than outdoor relic -- is the ancient remains of a structure that housed/imprisoned Emperor Augustus' daughter, Giulia, who was exiled there for her promiscuity and immorality. The other is the Archeological Museum, which in its more standard presentation holds many artifacts that have been uncovered on the island over the years. Unlike its more frantic (by Italian standards) and popular southern neighbors, Ischia and Capri, Ventotene has barely been touched by international tourism. The hotels are affordable, and the food isn't overpriced. Today, it's home to a year-round population of about 600. That number skyrockets during the summer months, especially in August, when it seems that every Italian heads to the seaside, or September, when the Festival of Saint Candice (Festa di Santa Candida) turns the island into one extended party. Ventotene's real appeal isn't in its breathtaking 360-degree sea views, its clear, clean water or even its architecture and people. There are other places in Italy just as stunning. Its charm is in the sense you get that you're experiencing something not discovered by the tourists who flock en masse to the rest of Italy year-round. A sense you're among Italians.","Ventotene lies in the Tyrrhenian Sea off the west coast of Italy .

"(CNN) -- Can ideas get you high? My approach to creating content is focused on pulling people out of their intellectual comfort zones. I'm interested in presenting ideas in unique ways that challenge people to question their assumptions. My mode of presentation is short-form video -- basically I create fast cut, impassioned ""idea explainers"" that explode with enthusiasm and intensity as they distill how technology is expanding our sphere of possibility. I want big ideas to have aesthetic relevance. I want to tickle people's intellectual sensibilities and instill a sense of wonder. I think big ideas should get people high! My short videos, which I call shots of philosophical espresso, are trailers for these ideas. They are not a substitute for a book or academic paper -- they are instigators. My work is simply another way for wider audiences to engage with these ideas. My goal is for those who might not be inclined toward heady discourse to find a way still to connect to these ideas. Psychologist Nicholas Humphrey coined the term ""the biological advantage of being awestruck"" to describe his theory on why our unique ability to be enthralled was, somehow, biologically selected for in a Darwinian sense. He believes this quirk of our consciousness imbues our lives with a sense of cosmic significance that over the course of history has resulted in a species that works harder not just to survive but to flourish and thrive. To ""awe"" gives us a ""raison d'etre."" A reason for being. You can learn more about Humphrey's idea in my video ""A Movie Trailer for Awe."" Humphrey says being enchanted by the magic of experience, rather than being just an aid to survival, provides an essential incentive to survive. ""We relish just being here,"" he says. ""We feel the yen to confirm and renew, in small ways or large, our own occupancy of the present moment, to go deeper, to extend it, to revel in being there, and when we have the skill, to celebrate it in words. ..."" As pop philosopher Alain De Botton wrote in ""The Art of Travel,"" ""There is an urge to say: I was here, I felt this, and it matters!"" And this sense of cosmic awe continues to manifest itself in the age of technology, as Erik Davis wrote in his book ""TechGnosis"": . ""Collectively, Human societies can no more dodge sublime imaginings or spiritual yearnings than they can transcend the tidal pulls of Eros. ... ""We are beset with a thirst for meaning and connection that centuries of skeptical philosophy, hardheaded materialism cannot eliminate. ... Today we turn to the cosmic awe conjured by science fiction, or the outer-space snapshots of the Hubble telescope as it calls forth our ever-deeper, ever-brighter possible selves."" Terence McKenna, in his book ""Food of the Gods,"" wrote about the origins of human language: this unique, often ecstatic expression of consciousness that bursts forth as morsels of meaning encoded as vocal patterns. He believes the origins of language stem from our early use of psychedelic compounds, which caused a sort of ""ontological awakening"" of our species and thus acted as an early catalyst for religion, cosmic feelings of awe and a desire for transcendent experiences. These experiences, to borrow the words of Tim Doody, re-contextualize oneself as a marvelous conduit in a timeless whole, through which molecules and meaning flow, from nebulae to neurons and back again. Early shamans, Davis wrote in ""TechGnosis,"" became ecstatic technicians of the sacred. Regardless of whether you buy McKenna's theory, he does provide a compelling case for the relationship between ""cosmic, out-of-body euphoria"" and the cognitive leaps to which it can give rise. Some of our greatest poets, scientists and other thinkers have attributed some of their greatest inspiration to the use of these psychedelic chemicals and their resulting out-of-context perspectives. But it's not necessarily the chemicals themselves I'm interested in, but rather what they do to our sense of perspective and our reference points. My focus is the subjective experiences they seem ""to occasion."" Tom Robbins explains: . ""The plant genies don't manufacture imagination, nor do they market wonder and beauty -- but they force us out of context so dramatically and so meditatively that we gawk in amazement at the ubiquitous everyday wonders that we are culturally disposed to overlook, and they teach us invaluable lessons about fluidity, relativity, flexibility and paradox. Such an increase in awareness, if skillfully applied, can lift a disciplined, adventurous artist permanently out of reach of the faded jaws of mediocrity."" In my mind the key idea here is that of being forced out of context. We don't necessarily require psychedelics for this, although they might offer a shortcut. What we require is a bold new attitude and a sense of humility that accepts the ambiguity of many of our so-called truths, habitual thought patterns and cultural reality tunnels. By accepting the need to constantly de-condition our thinking to approach the world with new eyes, we can reconnect with our sense of awe and wonder. As Michael Pollan wrote, ""In order to see things as if for the first time, we must remember to forget."" Bucky Fuller used to say ""dare to be naive."" Oftentimes, our sense of what we think we know is precisely what prevents us from approaching situations free of prejudice. ""Banality is a defense against being overwhelmed,"" Pollan wrote in his book ""The Botany of Desire."" This makes perfect sense to me: In a world where disruption is the new normal, and technological change is happening at an exponential rate; a world where we are bombarded with media messages, and where ""attention"" is the new limited resource, it seems easier to recoil away from all the mindblowingness going on, and instead look for reasons to be bored. The mundane can be quite comforting for those terrified of leaving their comfort zone. And this where I think my work serves the purpose of infecting people with wonderment. My short videos are ""digital psychedelics"" meant to ""de-center"" the self, dwindle the broadcast of the ego and provide people with a long view, ""big picture"" perspective on humanity, technology and how their symbiosis might make a dent in the cosmos. As Alan Harrington wrote in ""The Immortalist"": ""We must never forget we are cosmic revolutionaries.""

"(CNN) -- Apple fans won't have to wait as long to read the authorized story of Steve Jobs' life. Responding to a rush of interest following Wednesday's death of the Apple co-founder, Simon & Schuster announced it's moving up the publication date of its Steve Jobs biography from November 21 to October 24. The book by Walter Isaacson, titled simply, ""Steve Jobs,"" rocketed from 437 to No. 1 on Amazon's bestseller list -- a spike of 43,000% -- in the hours after Jobs' death, thanks to pre-orders. It was No. 3 Thursday on Barnes & Noble's website, and also topped the list of bestselling books in Apple's own iTunes store. In its blurb for the book, Simon & Schuster promises ""a riveting story of the roller-coaster life and searingly intense personality of a creative entrepreneur whose passion for perfection and ferocious drive revolutionized six industries: personal computers, animated movies, music, phones, tablet computing, and digital publishing."" The book is based on more than 40 interviews with Jobs conducted over two years, as well as interviews with more than 100 family members, friends, adversaries, competitors, and colleagues. Simon & Schuster claims that although Jobs cooperated with the book, he asked for no control over what was written nor the right to read it before it was published. Isaacson, a former chairman of CNN and the managing editor of Time magazine, which shares a parent company with CNN, has written biographies of Benjamin Franklin and Henry Kissinger. The 656-page Jobs book retails for $35, although online booksellers on Thursday were pricing it about half that. Interest in Apple's iconic former leader also boosted online sales of a handful of other Jobs-related books, including ""I, Steve: Steve Jobs in His Own Words,"" by George Beahm, and ""Inside Steve's Brain,"" by Leander Kahney.","Publication date of a Steve Jobs biography is being moved up a month, to October 24 .

"(CNN) -- The Steubenville, Ohio, rape case has made national headlines because it represents a perfect storm of inappropriate sexual conduct, high-school football heroes, social media and viral YouTube videos. The case reached some level of closure on Sunday as Judge Thomas Lipps handed down the juvenile equivalent of a guilty verdict and sentenced the two defendants to what could be years in a juvenile correctional facility as a consequence of their actions on August 11 and 12 of last year. Two teens found guilty in Steubenville rape case . This verdict is a consequence not only of the defendants' actions that night, but also of decades of change in how society views sexual conduct -- and how the law has evolved in response to this change. In this case, a high school girl went to a party and allegedly drank so much that she began slurring her words and was occasionally unresponsive. Two football stars at the party are accused of taking advantage of her impaired state and engaging in sexual conduct with her. A few decades ago, this behavior would probably have been considered inappropriate or ""ungentlemanly."" Today, it brings protesters into the streets and creates a nationwide outcry about sexual abuse. The law has evolved as societal norms have changed. Lots of sexual conduct occurs when one or both participants are intoxicated to some extent. The question that the law needs to answer -- but at times struggles to answer -- is at what point one person's intoxication is so severe that she (or he, in theory) is legally unable to give meaningful consent. Ohio law, like that of many states, sets this line at the point at which the victim's ""ability to resist or consent was substantially impaired"" by alcohol. But how impaired is ""substantially impaired""? In most cases, this question will be answered by a jury. (In the Steubenville case, the question was decided by the judge because the case was in juvenile court.) This could in theory be a fine line, though after hearing from the witnesses in the Steubenville case, most people today would agree with the court that this victim was well over that line. Teens treated girl 'like a toy,' prosecutor says . A second lesson from this case is how the ubiquity of social media affects the way criminal cases are investigated and prosecuted. The Steubenville case was a dramatic example of this phenomenon: The victim only knew that a crime had been committed against her because she was featured in online photos and posts. Much of this online material was inadmissible in court. (For example, the infamous 12-minute video in which a person at the party jokes about the rape did much to increase public outrage, but would be rejected as hearsay in court.) But the famous photo of the victim in which she is being carried by her wrists and ankles at the party was critical to establishing her level of intoxication. The prosecutor also admitted the texts in which one of the defendants stated ""she (the victim) was like a dead body"" and ""she could barely move."" These texts went a long way toward establishing that the defendants knew that the victim was so impaired that she was unable to consent. (Statements made by a party in the case are exempt from the hearsay rule.) A generation ago, in a case that came to represent a different example of changing social norms, four police officers in Los Angeles were brought to trial for assaulting Rodney King only because a bystander happened to have a video camera with him and was able to record the abuse. At the time we thought: What a lucky coincidence for the prosecutor! And what bad luck for the police officers! But today we should all assume that anything we do could be caught on camera or video. Meanwhile, many of the things we ""say"" to others are actually communicated by text, e-mail or online posting. Digital communication is so commonplace, especially among the younger generation, that those who engage in it are often not aware that they are creating a permanent record of their impressions, opinions and beliefs which could later be used in court. In short, the Steubenville case has demonstrated how the rules have changed. Alcohol will still be present at parties and will still be an element in many sexual encounters -- but now prosecutors, judges and juries will impose their own standards for the acceptable level of impairment. And when we commit crimes, the world -- and more importantly, the future jurors in our case -- will be watching. rape trial focuses on text messages, cell phone pictures .

"(Financial Times) -- HSBC is gearing up for thousands more job cuts, with Europe's biggest bank by market value set to outline the next stage in its strategic overhaul at an investor day in two months' time. ""There is no fantastical new strategy out there,"" said one person familiar with the bank's planning. ""But there's still huge potential to be more efficient."" Stuart Gulliver, HSBC's chief executive, said when he announced annual results last week that he would ""fixate on costs"" over the coming year and promised to find a further $1bn of annual savings in 2013. The job cuts target has still to be fixed but people close to the bank suggested up to 5,000 staff could go as part of the $1bn savings plan. If HSBC maintained the recent rate of staff cuts to cost savings, the number would be closer to 10,000. Mr Gulliver, in charge since early 2011, has spent the past two years trying to streamline HSBC's global network of fiefdoms, both in order to impose more control from head office in London and to strip out overlaps and inefficiencies. HSBC has already exceeded its target of finding $2.5-$3.5bn of cost savings by 2013, announcing $3.6bn of ""sustainable annual savings"" with its 2012 results. But the bank remains as far as ever from a related target -- to cut the bank's elevated cost-income ratio to between 48 and 52 per cent. Last year the ratio, which measures overheads as a proportion of revenue, spiralled upwards to 62.8 per cent. The number was inflated by the one-off cost of paying a $1.9bn fine to US regulators over money laundering and sanctions abuses. But even with that stripped out the cost-income ratio was still 56 per cent, as revenue numbers were held back by anaemic economic growth in much of the world. The details of Mr Gulliver's plan are set to be outlined to investors in May. The bank is expected to close or sell a further eight to 10 businesses this year and next, in addition to the 49 already divested since 2011. The new job cuts will come in addition to a sharp reduction of staff numbers -- from 302,000 to 260,000 -- over the past two years. About 10,000 of the headcount reduction so far has been the result of divestments, with the rest due to cuts. But according to people involved in planning the investor day, the tally of cuts could be more dramatic still if Mr Gulliver presses ahead with plans to uproot HSBC's tradition of in-house software development. The number of staff working in that area is already estimated to have been trimmed from 27,000 to about 21,000. But many more are likely to go as the bank shifts towards an outsourcing approach. Bankers said contraction was likely to be gradual and would be offset to an extent by the creation of new jobs as HSBC pushes aggressively into new technology areas, such as mobile banking. © The Financial Times Limited 2013 .","HSBC is gearing up for thousands more job cuts .

"(CNN) -- A welcome spotlight is now being shone on the murky trade in European horsemeat, but the public are still being left in the dark about the brutal treatment and needless suffering of the horses destined for their plates. Every year around 65,000 horses are crammed into trucks and transported across Europe to the slaughterhouse for what can be days on end in hellish conditions. Q&A: What's behind the horsemeat contamination scandal? Stressed, injured, exhausted, dehydrated and suffering from disease, these horses are desperate for food, water and rest. No type of horse is spared: including infirm working horses, foals (foal steak commands a premium among those who eat horse meat) and those bred and fattened to obesity to command the highest prices at slaughter. Few, if any of them, are fit enough to travel on such long journeys -- a feat which would challenge even the most athletic sport horses. Many thousands of America's horses are also transported vast distances on journeys to slaughter in Mexico and Canada, so this is not simply a European problem. EU health chief vows plan to restore confidence in wake of horsemeat scandal . World Horse Welfare undertakes regular field investigations as part of its campaign to stop these long-distance journeys, and for years we have documented the appalling suffering of these horses. In recent shipments we inspected, 89% of the horses had an injury and 93% showed clinical signs of disease. Their misery was clear - all were showing signs of exhaustion and depression and many had suffered painful wounds from poorly designed compartments and terrible friction injuries due to inadequate space on the vehicle. No animal should have to suffer this. The European Commission's own advisors, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) have clearly stated that ""journey duration should not exceed 12 hours for horses."" First UK tests reveal scope of horsemeat contamination . Yet still the European Commission refuses to change the legislation that allows horses to be transported indefinitely, so long as they are given rest every 24 hours (a rule often broken, in part because it is unenforceable in practice). Horses' immune systems decline after 10 hours of transportation making them more susceptible to disease. This is extremely unpleasant for the horses and it also poses a real risk to the equine industry of Europe, as horses intended for slaughter, often mix with other horses along the major routes. We regularly present the findings from our investigations to the European Commission, and share information on breaches of transport law with the authorities. We have also presented a number of recommendations in our 'Dossier of Evidence' of welfare problems caused by the trade and our proposed solutions. At the center of these recommendations is a 9-12 hour journey limit for horses (in keeping with the view of the European Commission's own scientific advisors), which is perfectly feasible given the abundance of slaughterhouses licenced to take horses, and would actually save money and red tape by harmonising with other laws. Yet the European Commission still refuses to act. So what we can do to help these horses? First, we can make people aware of this appalling trade and encourage more Europeans to speak out against it. We can also write to our own governments in Europe to call for change. And we can continue to press the European Commission for the short, maximum journey limit that is recommended by the Commission's own scientific experts. This is not about stopping people eating horsemeat -- that is a personal choice -- it is about fulfilling our basic responsibility to care for horses during their lifetime. Together the louder we can shout to be the horses' voice, the more chance we'll have to put an end to this needless suffering. And that's exactly what it is -- utterly needless, reckless and brutal. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Roly Owers.","Roly Owers says public must be made aware of appalling consequences of horse trade .

"(CNN) -- Penn State's legal battles continued Wednesday with the university's primary general liability insurer filing a motion claiming coverage should be denied because the administration failed to disclose what it knew about former coach Jerry Sandusky's behavior, according to legal documents. The motion, filed in common pleas court by the Pennsylvania Manufacturer's Association, says Penn State did not provide it with information relevant to the insurable risk the association assumed. The association has already sued Penn State over the coverage of one of Sandusky's victims' claims against the university, filed in November 2011. Report: Penn State faced 4-year 'death penalty' The association has insured Penn State under general liability policies since 1976. ""It would be unlawful and contradictory to public policy to require PMA to provide coverage to PSU under any policy issued to PSU after May 1998 with respect to PSU's concealment of Sandusky's sexually abusive conduct ... and failure to take appropriate action to prevent Sandusky from molesting minors,"" the motion read. Penn State alum: 'We are more than this tragedy' The motion comes days after former Penn State President Graham Spanier denied a role in a university cover-up of Sandusky's actions. Spanier has not been criminally charged in the case. However, an investigation by ex-FBI chief Louis Freeh concluded that he helped university officials conceal allegations of sexual abuse against the former assistant football coach. No one from the Pennsylvania Manufacturer's Association was immediately available for comment. Sandusky, 68, was convicted in late June of 45 of the 48 sexual abuse counts he faced, involving 10 victims. He was an assistant football coach at Penn State for more than 40 years until he resigned in 1999 but still had access to Penn State facilities through his charity until he was arrested in 2011. Sandusky founded The Second Mile, a nonprofit organization for underprivileged youth and several of his victims attended the program. The foundation announced in May it will close. Do sanctions alter Paterno's legacy? He will be sentenced in September. The Penn State Board of Trustees met Wednesday night to discuss football sanctions handed down by the NCAA. According to a statement, the members found the sanctions difficult, but understood that they could have been much worse, reportedly a multiyear shut down of the team, a traditional major college football power. No votes were taken, the statement said. ""The university and board resolve to move forward together to recognize the historical excellence in Penn State's academic and athletic programs,"" the board said. ""We anticipate and look forward to demonstrating our outstanding performance in complying with the sanctions."" Five experts: What happens to Penn State football now? On Thursday, Steve Garban became the first Penn State Board of Trustees member to resign since the Freeh report. The NCAA handed Penn State a number of severe and unprecedented sanctions Monday for ""perpetuating a 'football first' culture that ultimately enabled serial child sexual abuse to occur,"" according to the NCAA website. The sanctions include a record $60 million fine, a four-year postseason ban, a four-year reduction in football scholarships and five years of probation. Penn State was also forced to vacate its football victories since 1998, including 111 by the late Joe Paterno, costing him the record as the winningest coach in the NCAA's top division. Transfer rules for Penn State players clarified . CNN's Susan Candiotti contributed to this report.","Penn State insurer says former officials withheld information on Jerry Sandusky's behavior .

"Hong Kong (CNN) -- Cushla wore a white dress for her big day, Tania, braces, a hat and bow-tie. The couple, now wife and wife, tied the knot during a small ceremony led by an unregistered celebrant on a farm west of Sydney, Australia. It had all the hallmarks of a ""real"" wedding. Except this one wasn't valid, at least under Australian law. Australia is one of many countries around the world where same-sex couples are not permitted to legally marry. And the law doesn't seem likely to change any time soon. Prime Minister Julia Gillard, who has long opposed gay marriage, made it clear Thursday that her mind hadn't been nudged by a politically risky move by U.S. President Barack Obama to back same-sex marriages Wednesday night. ""My view hasn't changed and when a bill comes to the parliament later this year, moved by private members, Stephen Jones, one of our Labor members... When that bill comes to the parliament this year I won't vote for it,"" Gillard told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Jones is one of two members of parliament who have submitted a private member's bill that calls for the legalization of gay marriage, however neither Gillard nor main opposition leader Tony Abbott support it. ""Obviously at this stage we've still got more work to do,"" said John Kloprogge, spokesman for campaign group Australian Marriage Equality. ""But we are confident that this issue has the support of the majority of Australians and it will eventually be supported by the leaders of our major parties."" Obama's decision to openly endorse same-sex marriage won plaudits from campaigners worldwide who have been pushing for more liberal laws since the first same-sex couples walked down the aisle in the Netherlands in 2001. Same-sex marriages are now allowed in a number of U.S. states and in countries including Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, Iceland and Argentina, according to Australian Marriage Equality. Wedding bells are close to ringing on same-sex marriages elsewhere: Leading human rights activist Peter Tatchell hailed Obama's move as evidence that support for same-sex marriage was ""an unstoppable global trend"". ""Gay marriage is all about love,"" he said. ""The love of same-sex couples is just as real, strong and committed as that of married heterosexual men and women. Prohibiting same-sex marriage devalues and denigrates the love of lesbian and gay couples. It signifies our continuing second class legal status."" British Prime Minister David Cameron has said he supports their legalization in the UK, where authorities are currently consulting on the issue, having permitted civil partnerships since 2005. However the issue's omission this week from the Queen's Speech, which outlines laws to be introduced in the coming months, dismayed campaigners. Ben Summerskill, of gay rights charity Stonewall said he was ""disappointed,"" and pledged ""to push both coalition parties to deliver on their promise... by 2015."" After becoming the first country to legalize same-sex unions in 1989, Denmark is close to doing the same for same-sex marriages. In 2007, Nepal's Supreme Court ruled that the rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex (LGBTI) people should be protected and that a committee be formed to draft laws on same-sex marriage. While the government has made some progress -- such as allowing a third gender option on the census -- full protections and marriage rights have yet to be enshrined by law. However, in many countries LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) campaigners are nowhere near close to reaching for the confetti on gay marriage. Simply being able to live without fear or prejudice is the aim of activists in countries where homosexuality remains taboo or illegal. According to a report released in May 2011 by the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, same-sex relations are still criminalized in 76 countries, and in five of those countries the death penalty can be applied. The countries with the harshest penalties are in Africa and the Middle East. MPs in Uganda have repeatedly tried to introduce an anti-homosexuality bill which would make homosexual acts a capital offense; prominent gay rights activist David Kato was beaten to death in the country in 2011. And even in South Africa, where single sex marriage was legalized in 2006, and where the post-apartheid constitution bans prejudice on the grounds of homosexuality, attacks on gays and lesbians -- including instances of so-called ""corrective rape"" -- still occur. In other regions too, attitudes have been slow to change. In Indonesia, efforts to frame a Gender Equality Bill were resisted by campaigners who said that gender equality could open up room for legalizing same sex unions, according to Human Rights Watch. Last month, a court in Malaysia backed police over its ban on a gay rights festival which officials argued could disrupt public order. And in Hong Kong, the sexuality of pop star Anthony Wong made headlines when he confirmed, after years of speculation, that he was gay. It was said to be the first time in nine years that a pop star had come out as homosexual in China's Special Administrative Region. ""Hong Kong doesn't have the gay bashing that a lot of countries have... But at the same time you still have people who are very ignorant,"" said Reggie Ho, Chairman of the Pink Alliance which is organizing a concert Wong is due to perform at on Saturday, May 12. The rally is part of an event to mark International Day Against Homophobia and Transphobia (IDAHOT), which is observed in 60 countries. The official date is May 17, the day in 1990 that the World Health Organization removed homosexuality from its list of mental disorders. ""They gossip about you, or they make suggestions that hurt you very much. So it's that kind of discrimination and the fact that the Hong Kong government has not moved forward at all in terms of legislating against discrimination against sexual minorities,"" Ho said. Separately in Australia on Saturday, campaigners will be holding a National Day of Action for Marriage Equality when thousands are expected to march through major cities calling for same-sex marriage. ""A lot of people are getting exasperated that we don't have it yet,"" said Jessica Payne who is organizing the Brisbane march. ""I think it is a matter of time but it's not going to happen without a push."" Cushla said she and Tania weren't willing to sit around and wait ""and hope"" for same-sex marriage to become legal. ""I didn't want to miss out. I just wanted it to be the way that we wanted it to be, despite the fact that my partner is a woman,"" she said. ""Eventually, when it becomes legal, we'll legally bind it."" CNN's Bryony Jones contributed to this report.","Campaigners worldwide pushing for same-sex marriages .

"(CNN) -- In the 1970s the world was coming to an end. Famines in Bangladesh, the Sahel and Ethiopia seemed to prove Malthus finally right. Population growth was outstripping food supplies, food prices skyrocketed: people like Paul Ehrlich warned of a ""population bomb"". Yet, the apocalypse did not happen. Agricultural productivity growth not only fed more people, but also accommodated a resource guzzling boom in meat consumption. If skeptics pointed to inequalities and persisting hunger, the neoliberal orthodoxy would tell them to be patient until trickle-down effects would have worked their magic. African agriculture key . If it has ever worked, it does so no more. The number of chronically hungry people has hovered around one billion for more than a decade. Large swathes of the developing world, including Africa, have seen a worrying decoupling from the trend of long-term economic growth. Given that the livelihoods of most Africans are linked to the agricultural sector, there is widespread agreement that African agriculture is the key battlefront to tackle hunger and poverty. Heated debate . In the last three years, a virulent debate has unfolded between two camps with diametrically opposed views. In one corner, we find global agro-business, the international financial institutions and governments of emerging powers like China, India and the Gulf Arab states. They advocate a transformation of African agriculture through commercialization and large-scale foreign investment with the goal of increasing food supply and augmenting productivity of African farms. This, or so the theory goes, is generating income, employment and export revenues for impoverished African states, while providing food to the Arabian Peninsula and industrial inputs like cotton to East Asia. The other camp, consisting of international and African NGOs and skeptical academics, rejects this logic as an unconvincing excuse for lucrative collusion between African and foreign elites, largely at the expense of the rural masses. They denounce these ""land grabs""  by referring to large-scale displacement of farmers deemed ""unproductive"" and claim that the investments increase rather than decrease global hunger, as the benefits accrue to transnational partnerships while producing little food or income for locals. Groundwork . So what is actually happening on the ground? The truth is that, despite years of heated debate, we still know very little. The much hyped ""Land Matrix""-initiative claims to have put together the single largest, most comprehensive database so far on international agricultural investments (""land grabs"") to further inform policy. Yet, it reports deals that have never happened, like the alleged acquisition of millions of hectares in Madagascar and Congo by South-Korean Daewoo and Chinese ZTE. There is a fairly uncritical reliance on extensive media reporting of big deals. 'Landgrabs' sell newspapers and raise funds for NGOs and academics, so why ruin a good story? Case study: Sudan . Still, it is worth insisting: What is actually happening on the ground? An interesting case in point is Sudan. It has been the focal point of agro-investments by Gulf countries in the 1970s and again today. The country is best known for decades of violent conflict and devastating hunger. Yet the controversy in Western media over the secession of South Sudan and the war in Darfur has sometimes obscured the important hydro-agricultural dynamics of recent years. While the Land Matrix, to our surprise, scarcely reports any major agricultural investment in Northern and Central Sudan and uncritically copies a report on South Sudan with unimplemented project announcements, the military-Islamist government has spent the better part of the last decade positioning itself as a potential ""breadbasket"" for East Africa and the Arabian Peninsula. Omar Al-Bashir's Khartoum hopes to attract one billion dollars annually in investments from Kuwait, China, Qatar and other emerging powers, partly to offset the loss of 75% of oil revenues due to the Southern secession, partly to build new political alliances domestically and internationally to entrench the regime in power for another decade. Untapped Resources . The basic logic, as presented by the Sudanese government and its Gulf Arab partners during grand televised conferences, is sound: Sudan has historically underused its vast agricultural potential and low productivity is one of the key problems locking farming communities in poverty. Investment, foreign or domestic, in agriculture has been woefully low for 30 years; the agricultural crisis of rural Sudan is one of the great drivers of widening inequality, vulnerability to climatic changes and civil strife in the peripheries. Sceptical Voices . At the same time, more sceptical voices have been right to warn against the euphoria of a possible agricultural revolution in Sudan with the assistance of Arab capital. The memories of the last time such an ambitious project was launched, back in the 1970s, are still vivid: the projects never got off the ground or were unprofitable and the vision violently crashed when tens of thousands of smallholders were forcibly driven off their land to make way for big mechanised farming in Central Sudan. This contributed to a country-wide civil war between 1983 and 2005. These ghosts of the past understandably influence alarmist accounts surrounding foreign direct investment (FDI) in Sudan and South Sudan. Headline v Reality . But the emerging picture is neither one of grand capitalist transformation and agricultural revival, nor one of all-out land grab that is leading to dispossession and growing impoverishment of ever more Sudanese. There is a striking gap between the spectacular headline announcements and the reality that little actual investment seems to have transpired. There are Gulf funds that have announced humungous agro-projects without a single agro-engineer among their ranks. According to confidential Ministry of Investment statistics that one of the authors was able to see, only about 20% of all agricultural partnerships concluded between Sudanese and foreign investors actually have seen some degree of implementation. Perhaps only a quarter of all promised FDI sums for commercial agriculture reach Sudan. An Africa-wide issue . The reasons for this botched agricultural revolution are many but they seem to apply not just to Sudan, but also elsewhere in Africa. Whilst high commodity prices and growing resource pressures heighten the interest of emerging powers and Western investors, the fundamental obstacles that have held African agriculture back previously still remain largely in place. A chaotic regulatory framework; political instability; high costs of training local workers; poor infrastructure to bring produce to local and international markets; weakly integrated national and regional agricultural development strategies; hidden taxes and corruption; and elites looking for quick gains rather than long-term empowerment of rural areas which are left out of the process. Mirage in the desert . The land grab phenomenon in Sudan and in many (though not all) African countries thus increasingly resembles a fata morgana, a mirage in the desert which completely distorts the object on which it is based. Not only is far more thorough and non-ideology driven research needed on foreign investment and, where it actually takes place, its impact on local communities and national welfare. Above all, the fata morgana nature of agricultural development in Africa calls for a serious re-examination of how the continent's farmers can move from being among the main victims of global hunger to becoming more productive cultivators of the commodities that Africa and the world sorely need. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Harry Verhoeven and Dr Eckart Woertz .","Agriculture is the key battlefront to tackling hunger and poverty in Africa .
Two schools of thought have emerged on large-scale foreign investment in the continent .
Agricultural crisis of rural Sudan is one of great drivers of widening inequality .

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- ""Teflon Don"" rapper Rick Ross crashed his silver Rolls Royce into an apartment building after he heard gunfire along a Fort Lauderdale, Florida, street Monday morning, police said. ""The driver of the Rolls Royce attempted to drive away from the direction of the shots being fired and lost control of the vehicle, striking a nearby apartment building,"" Fort Lauderdale Police Detective DeAnna Garcia said. Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or the gunshots, Garcia said. ""The suspects fled from the area prior to police arrival,"" she said. The incident, however, called attention to threats against the artist's life made in a street gang's videos and posted online in recent months. ""We're pulling up on you,"" a man who identified himself as a member of the Gangster Disciples warned in one of the videos. ""Whatever city, whatever state, the pressure on."" Several videos purporting to be from Gangster Disciple members in several states -- including Georgia, North Carolina and Florida -- appeared on YouTube late last year demanding that Ross pay a fee to them for his use of the Star of David, which they claim as a gang symbol, and a reference to one of their founders in his music and marketing. ""You got to cut the check,"" one video said. ""Tell your boss man he got to get that check, or all you in trouble."" ""We need that cash right now,"" another said. Ross, 37, whose albums include ""Teflon Don"" in 2010 and ""Deeper Than Rap"" a year earlier, told south Florida radio station 99 Jamz last month that he was not intimidated by the threats. ""Ain't never no checks getting cut,"" he said. ""I don't play those games. I consider that extortion."" Is Nas hip-hop's finest MC? Ross did cancel his North Carolina shows last month just days after a video appeared online threatening his life if he performed there. ""Never was it due to any threats,"" he told the radio station. Instead, he canceled because ""the promoter wasn't really handling his business."" Ross wanted to make certain that listeners understood he was not frightened. ""Don't ever get it twisted, Ricky Ross is the boss,"" he said. The death threats are not the only challenge to Ross. A former drug lord and gang leader is suing in a Los Angeles court, accusing him of stealing his name and reputation. ""The reality is I want justice done,"" the original Ross wrote in an e-mail to CNN. ""I know that he took his name and image from my life and believe he is unfairly profiting off my story."" Ricky ""Freeway"" Ross was serving a prison sentence a decade ago when rapper William Roberts, who previously worked as a Florida correctional officer, adopted ""Rick Ross"" as his stage name, according to the lawsuit. ""This rapper and his labels clearly knew of my name and story, and have tried to suck out the lifeblood without license,"" the former drug lord said. ""I have my own use for my intellectual property and did not need this confusion created."" More recently, the rapper has been using the name ""Ricky Rozay."" The rapper and his record label have not responded to CNN's request for comment. Despite the death threats and legal issues, his music is doing well. Ross is nominated for a best rap album Grammy for his latest release, ""God Forgives, I Don't."" CNN's Marlena Baldacci contributed to this report.","Rapper Rick Ross and a female passenger were not hurt by the wreck or gunshots .

"(CNN) -- Ohio prosecutors are asking that a teenager be tried as an adult in the killings of three men and the wounding of a fourth, each of whom answered a Craigslist ad for work on a cattle farm, officials said Tuesday. Brogan Rafferty, 16, and Richard Beasley, 52, face multiple charges in the case. An Ohio grand jury Friday indicted Beasley, alleging that he pulled the trigger. His arraignment is scheduled for Wednesday, said April Wiesner, director of communications for the Summit County prosecutor's office. Rafferty, of Stow, Ohio, had a preliminary hearing Monday at which prosecutors filed a motion asking he be tried as an adult, Wiesner said. A probable cause hearing on whether to bind him over to adult court has not been set, she said. The high school sophomore is charged with three counts of aggravated murder, one count of attempted murder, and robbery and kidnapping, according to Wiesner. Rafferty has entered a not guilty plea. His father, Michael, told CNN Cleveland affiliate WJW in late November that his son had been ""manipulated"" and ""corrupted,"" insisting that the teenager is a ""mild-mannered gentleman."" The father also said that his son unwittingly dug the graves at Beasley's direction, WJW reported. The boy's mother said her son denied killing anyone and added that Beasley portrayed himself as ""a chaplain"" who gave food to the homeless. Beasley faces multiple counts of aggravated murder, kidnapping and aggravated robbery as well as a host of other charges, according to the 28-page indictment released Friday. Ralph Geiger, 56, of Akron, Ohio; David Pauley, 51, of Norfolk, Virginia; and Timothy Kern, 47, of Massillon, Ohio; were found dead in separate shallow graves after they responded to an online ad soliciting workers between August and November of last year, authorities have said. Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine acknowledged last week there may be more victims, and thus more charges. ""We are dealing with serial killings here,"" DeWine told reporters, pleading for the public to provide more information. ""Are there more bodies? Frankly, we don't know. If there are, we need to find them."" The indictment calls Beasley the ""principal offender"" in the killings, Summit County Prosecutor Sherri Bevan Walsh said. He could be eligible for the death penalty if he is convicted, because the killings appear to meet one or more requirements for that sentence, including purposely causing the death of two or more people and murdering people while a fugitive, committing a kidnapping and/or committing armed robbery. ""This case deserves the death penalty for a multitude of reasons,"" Walsh said. ""This case, we view to be one of the worst of the worst when it comes to horrible murder cases."" The investigation into the killings began the night of November 6, when a Noble County deputy sheriff responded to a call and came upon a ""white, middle-aged man being treated for a gunshot wound to the right arm,"" according to Sheriff Stephen S. Hannum of Noble County. The wounded man -- who was identified in the indictment as Scott Davis, 48, from South Carolina -- told the law enforcement officer that he had answered an ad on the Craigslist website offering work caring for cattle on a 688-acre property in eastern Ohio. He met with two males, including Beasley, and drove with them toward Stock Township, Ohio. After being told a road was closed due to a landslide, Davis got out of the car to start walking toward the property, which he was told was nearby. Davis told the sheriff that, while walking through a heavily wooded area, he turned around ""to see a gun pointed at his head. He deflected the gun and ran"" -- getting shot in the arm while fleeing, the sheriff explained late last year. The victim hid for seven hours in the forest before going to a house and requesting help, Hannum said . The third victim, Kern, was killed one week after Davis' escape, according to authorities. The attorney general said that the victims were all ""down on their luck"" men trying to take advantage of an opportunity to ""have a better life."" One of the shooting victims was found in Summit County and the others in Noble County. The attorney general's office and local jurisdictions decided to consolidate the cases in Summit County. CNN's John Fricke and Rich Porter contributed to this report.","A date has not yet been set for a hearing on charging the 16-year-old as an adult .

"(CNN) -- ""Boarding for Harvey Milk San Francisco International Airport."" Civil rights activist Stuart Milk can imagine the impact of that airport announcement on the scared young people he's met in the United Arab Emirates and other countries around the world, where gay people live in fear for their lives. Stuart Milk's uncle Harvey Milk, a San Francisco supervisor, was one of the first openly gay politicians in the United States when he and San Francisco Mayor George Moscone were killed by former supervisor Dan White at City Hall in 1978. ""San Francisco has 9 million international passengers and about 40 million passengers total passing through annually, and (this name change) sends an important message of societal change,"" said Stuart Milk, co-founder of the Harvey Milk Foundation. The name change could become a reality if a San Francisco lawmaker has his way. David Campos, an openly gay Latino member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors, plans to introduce legislation Tuesday to make naming the city's airport after Milk possible. The supervisor sees the likelihood of U.S. Supreme Court rulings later this year on cases getting at ""the core of whether or not members of the LGBT community will have equal treatment under the law"" as a prime time to initiate the tribute to Milk. ""It's appropriate for San Francisco at this time to recognize that members of the LGBT community are equal members of our society and to recognize the work of this hero. It sends a clear message of hope and civil rights, not just here but abroad,"" Campos said. Campos needs the support of six of the 11 Board of Supervisors members to get his charter amendment placed on the November ballot. Veteran political consultant Alex Clemens expects Campos to get those six votes and predicts a spirited debate leading up to the November election. ""Renaming our airport would provoke an international conversation, as some of the places in the world that are less evolved on LGBT issues would suddenly have 'Harvey Milk' as part of their daily -- or hourly! -- conversation patterns,"" Clemens wrote in an e-mail. ""And, of course, flights between Harvey Milk International Airport and Reagan National Airport would be joyous for those travelers who prefer their flights laden with as much irony as possible."" The introduction of this amendment by Campos puts San Francisco back in the spotlight ""as a beacon of hope"" throughout the United States and the world, said Stuart Milk.","Activists hope to hear slain politician Harvey Milk's name at airports around the world .

"(Parenting.com) -- I am a 38-year-old father of two little boys living in Portland, Oregon, and I like my circumcised penis. However, when it came time to decide the fate of my sons' own genitalia, my wife and I bucked the trend and let them live as they were born. First, to be clear: I'm no ""intactivist."" I do not feel nearly that passionately about the subject. I have absolutely no problem with anyone who decides to circumcise his or her child. Tradition is powerful stuff. And the American Academy of Pediatrics's newly revised policy statement will not, in my opinion, make the issue any clearer for expectant parents -- it remains artfully ambiguous. Yet, the revised policy does clearly state that the procedure should be covered by insurance. This will likely lead to greater access to circumcisions, which will surely be heralded by advocates. But for me, the decision came down to my penchant to leave well enough alone. I figure that nature knows better than I do about how to make a penis. That's it. Parenting: A history of circumcision . I'm not worried about the hygiene issues that are potentially related to uncircumcised penises. They are minor and rare. Besides, my boys are lucky enough to be able to bathe in clean water just about every day. I'll take the time to show them how to clean themselves just as the parent of a little girl must teach her to wash her vagina carefully. Considering that some estimate a 1.5 percent complication frequency rate among newly circumcised infants, I'm OK with my boys' risking the infrequent urinary tract infection. There is, I suppose, a slightly higher risk of HIV transmission and other sexually transmitted infections for uncircumcised males. But I trust that I'll be able to convey the importance of proper condom use when my boys reach the appropriate age. Should teens make circumcision decision? Before the birth of my first son, most of the parental backyard barbecue banter dealt with either aesthetics or tradition. Who was going to opt for the knife -- and why -- had a lot to do with personal preference, it seemed. Practical health issues and religious adherents were rarely, if ever, discussed. Either the men were adamant that their son look like them or they just didn't care if they didn't. There was some talk among the women about whether circumcised penises were ""cuter"" than uncircumcised penises. They couldn't agree. While amusing, I did not find any real substance in these discussions. There is also an argument to be made that circumcision, in effect, mutilates the genitals of a minor without their consent, which strikes me as neither fair nor particularly holistic. I can't help but wonder if the practice of male circumcision, as with female genital mutilation, has something to do with a fear of human sexuality and a desire to control. A stretch? Perhaps. But it is interesting to note that the Netherlands sure doesn't think so: In 2010, the Royal Dutch Medical Association stated that non-therapeutic male circumcision ""conflicts with the child's right to autonomy and physical integrity."" They went as far as to claim that there are as many good reasons for prohibition of male circumcision as there are for female genital mutilation. Parenting: Why I decided to circumcise my sons . I had a good friend who chose to get circumcised when we were in the eighth grade. I believe that he was solely motivated by pressure to look like his male peers. He was out of school for a week. I remember him telling me about the excruciating pain associated with the procedure. He was in pain for at least a week post-operation. Adolescents like to exaggerate, but I believed him. I remembered this anecdote when it came time to make the decision for my sons. I did not have any desire to subject my beautiful baby boys to excruciating pain, even with analgesia. The thought of forcing them to endure another traumatic experience right after birth seemed cruel. Parenting: How a circumcision is actually performed . Besides, the perception of what a ""normal"" penis should look like is rapidly changing. Our doctor here in Portland informed my wife and me that the circumcision rate was nearing 30% locally -- a far cry from the approximately 80% rate of the 1960s. Thirty percent is a lot closer to the global ratio. So, even if we move away from Portland someday (and go ahead, make all the Portlandia jokes you want), the likelihood that my boys' penises will be accepted is pretty high. The day will come when one of my boys will want to know why his penis is different than mine. It hasn't happened yet although the oldest is only 3. When it does, I will look him in the eye and tell him that people did things differently when I was born -- no big deal. Parenting: Boy parts -- and what to do with them .

"(CNN) -- It has all the trappings of a proper murder mystery: an attractive, up-and-coming victim, a sudden death, a mysterious stranger, whispers of poison. Only this case involves a dog, the highly competitive canine show circuit and a professionally adorable Samoyed named GCH CH Polar Mist Cruz'n T'party At Zamosky -- Cruz for short. The 3-year-old dog fell ill and died on February 16 in Lakewood, Colorado, barely a week after he appeared -- but didn't place -- in the prestigious Westminster dog show. ""I think somebody deliberately poisoned this dog,"" Cruz's handler, Robert Chaffin, told CNN on Friday. But, as with any good mystery, it's not that cut and dried. The profuse bleeding that killed Cruz can be caused by a number of conditions, according to the veterinarian who examined Cruz, Molly Comiskey. After Chaffin rushed the dog to the vet when he threw up blood, Cruz owner Lynnette Blue says, Comiskey listed rat poison as a possible cause. But because Chaffin and Blue declined a necropsy or further testing, the final answer won't ever be known, Comiskey said in a statement. Blue says Comiskey told her a necropsy wouldn't have shown anything if the dog had been poisoned days before. The few she's allowed before all turned up inconclusive, she said. ""Also, the thought at the time of him being cut open was too much for me,"" Blue said. Westminster dismissed the poisoning suggestion, saying no other dogs fell ill at the show. ""We have never, to our knowledge, had an incident at our show where a dog has become ill or was harmed as a result of being poisoned,"" the group said in a statement this week. But the sudden death of an otherwise healthy, closely watched dog seems to point toward poisoning, Chaffin and Blue say. Chaffin says he watched Cruz closely to make sure he didn't get into anything dangerous. The trip to New York was uneventful. He and Cruz dined on steak from a Manhattan restaurant the night before the show. He scoured their hotel room for no-nos. And they traveled together to Colorado, where he was appearing in the Rocky Mountain Classic dog show. The only unusual thing happened during the Westminster show, when a ""scowling"" woman emerged from the crowd and accused him of being ""cruel"" and a ""horrible person."" The Westminster show has been ""plagued by activists"" upset with the dog show circuit, Chaffin said. Among other things, people have been upset about a procedure called bark reduction, in which a dog's vocal cords are modified to make it quieter. Cruz had the procedure, Chaffin said. But he wouldn't go so far as to implicate activists -- or the mysterious, angry stranger -- in Cruz's death. ""I don't know who it was. I think it was done by someone who was sick,"" he said. It certainly wasn't us, said Lisa Lange, senior vice president of communications for People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals. ""It's absolutely outrageous. The people who should be charged with cruelty to animals in this case are the owners for having cut the vocal cords of this poor dog because they didn't want to hear him bark,"" she said. ""And unfortunately, this is not unique to these people. In the really creepy world of dog shows, animals are having their vocal cords cut, their ears cut, their tails are cut off, to make them look a certain way so that their owners can become famous or make money. And it's just sick and it's perverse, and of course it's cruel."" With so much uncertainty, Blue says, the mystery will probably never be solved. Whatever happened to Cruz, Chaffin and Blue are mourning the loss of the fluffy white dog, who was named best in breed at recent shows in Louisiana and California, and won best in show at contests in Mississippi this year and Louisiana and Texas last year, according to the website doggiestats.com. ""I just can't seem to stop crying and can hardly see,"" Blue wrote on her Facebook page. CNN's Ashley Fantz contributed to this report.","Sudden death of up-and-coming show dog puzzles owner, sparks talk of poisoning .

"(CNN) -- Pink hair, piercings and the name Emily -- Iowa father Paul Plate saw his own teenage daughter as he read about a different Emily's harrowing experience with synthetic marijuana. Plate had already had the conversation about the drug with his daughter. But reading about Emily Bauer, a Texas high school student left brain-damaged after smoking ""potpourri"" she bought at a convenience store, really put him in her parents' shoes. ""I felt horrible for her. I know we all do stupid things as kids, but to have an outcome like this is dreadful,"" said Plate, one of the thousands of readers who took the time to comment on the CNN.com story. ""I am a sucker for my little girl, so I know how I would feel in their place."" Bauer's tale set off warning bells for parents across the country: What is this drug? Why didn't her family keep her from smoking it? What should I tell my kids? What if that were my daughter? The teenager's symptoms of psychosis and strokes would jolt just about any parent into a conversation about the dangers of synthetic marijuana. Add in the statistics about the drug's popularity -- one in every nine U.S. high school seniors has admitted to smoking fake weed, according to a 2011 study -- and parents were alarmed. Opinion: Regulate fake pot, it's not going away . While parents like Plate sympathized with the Bauers, others said it would never happen to their kid. ""The story points to another example of people who shouldn't be allowed to be parents,"" wrote Lynn DeArmond, who added she was thankful Emily is recovering. She said her six children understand that using weed is unacceptable and they would face consequences if they smoked it. ""Parents need to start being parents instead of friends. To do otherwise results in these kind of stories or worse."" On the other side of the debate were parents who might allow their children to smoke real marijuana if that would keep them from experiencing Emily's fate. One dad argued for its legalization and suggested monitoring children while they try pot. ""Honestly, if my child was seriously showing signs of wanting to smoke pot, or even just try it, I'd probably buy it for them myself and make them do it at home, in a safe environment, just to make sure they're responsible,"" commenter Rob Doerr wrote. ""I think that's the responsible thing to do. You're being a parent, and monitoring your kid, making sure they don't do anything dumb."" Synthetic marijuana just as dangerous . Emily's stepfather, Tommy Bryant, welcomed the conversation because he wants to raise awareness of the drug, even if some of the comments weren't so kind. ""I don't wish this upon anybody,"" he said. ""My purpose is not to judge myself or judge others, but to get Emily well and help others learn from our mistakes, because obviously we did make a mistake, and I'll be the first to admit it."" While Bryant knows there will be critics and people out there questioning his parenting, he said he's just thankful to have more time with his daughter. ""I think back to all the fond memories I have of her, then I realize that somehow, I got another chance to make more,"" he said on Wednesday. ""And these new memories may actually impact others in a positive way ... I am thankful."" Parents: Do you talk to your children about the dangers of drugs? Why or why not?

"(CNN) -- As Islamists in northern Mali threatened to ""open the gates of hell,"" the United States is navigating one tricky quandary: how does it help in the battle against the militants without violating its own policy? U.S. policy prohibits direct military aid to Mali because the fledgling government is a result of a coup. Read more: Panetta: U.S. could provide logistical, intel support in Mali . No support can go to the Malian military directly until leaders are elected through an election, said Victoria Nuland, the State Department spokeswoman. ""We are not in a position to train the Malian military until we have democracy restored,"" she said this week. The international community is concerned that the militants will create a terrorist haven in the desert region, which analysts say has the potential to become the next Afghanistan. Read more: France vows to halt jihadist charge in Mali . Though Islamist militant groups affiliated with al Qaeda, such as Ansar Dine, are rampant in the north, they co-exist with other anti-government opportunists, complicating U.S. involvement in an offensive touted as anti-terror. As the defiant militants hunker down, administration officials are reviewing their options to support France, which is spearheading the international effort to oust the rebels in its former colony. Others in the international community have joined forces to help the weak Malian forces ward off instability that could reverberate worldwide. Read more: Rebels still hold key town in Mali, French defense minister says . So far, however, the United States has only shared intelligence from satellites and intercepted signals with the French, defense officials said. The Pentagon is also considering sending refueling tankers so that French jets can fly longer, more sustained combat missions, according to the officials. Read more: Islamist rebels gaining ground in Mali, French defense minister says . ""We've had a number of requests for support from the French in support of their operation,"" Nuland said in a state briefing Tuesday. ""They've asked for information sharing, they've asked for support with airlift, they've asked for support with aerial refueling. We are already providing information and we are looking hard today at the airlift question, helping them transport forces from France and from the area into the theater."" Ansar Dine would welcome U.S. troops on the ground, its commander, Omar Hamaha, told CNN's Erin Burnett. By fighting alongside Malian forces, ""France is signing a death warrant for French people around the world, opening the gates of hell,"" Hamaha said. ""This will be a long war ... more dangerous than Afghanistan and Iraq."" Other ways to help . Though the U.S. is wary of any troop involvement, it has found other ways to help. It is accelerating efforts to deploy West African troops to Mali. The Economic Community of West African States meets Friday to finalize plans that will be presented to the heads of state a day later in Ivory Coast. Nuland said the United States has offered pre-deployment training to West African troops, equipment and help in lifting them to Mali. Funding the troops so they can fight alongside their Malian counterparts does not violate U.S. law, she said. ""We are precluded under the counter-coup restrictions from funding a military that has been involved in a coup until democracy has been restored,"" she said. ""But we're not precluded from assisting allies and partners in trying to restore security to that country."" Several countries offer troops . Last week, French troops and warplanes joined Malian government forces to battle Islamist militants, who have seized most of the African nation's northern region. France said it has committed about 1,700 troops to the effort, including about 800 on the ground in Mali. France: We're not the pacifists you think we are . French President Francois Hollande said his nation has no intention of staying in Mali permanently, but it will do what is necessary to prepare for African forces. The United Nations said preparations are under way for a multidisciplinary team to go to Bamako. Leaders from a number of countries have offered troops or logistical support for the offensive. A Canadian military transport plane departed for Mali on Tuesday, where it will transport equipment and personnel. Two British military transport aircraft have been assigned to help with the French troop deployment, but no British forces will be in a combat role. The Nigerian army said it plans to deploy 900 soldiers within 10 days as part of a U.N.-mandated African force to fight the insurgents. A cycle of unrest . Mali had military rulers for decades until its first democratic elections in 1992. It remained stable politically until March, when soldiers toppled the government, saying it had not provided adequate support for them to fight ethnic Tuareg rebels in the largely desert north. Tuareg rebels, who'd sought independence for decades, took advantage of the power vacuum and seized swaths of land. A power struggle then erupted in the north between the Tuaregs and local al Qaeda-linked radicals, who wound up in control of the area the size of France. In addition to the al Qaeda threat, amputations, floggings and public executions have become common in areas controlled by radical Islamists. They applied a strict interpretation of Sharia law that included banning music, smoking, drinking and watching sports. What's behind the instability in Mali .

"(CNN) -- It's a 12-year-old oft-mocked clunker of an automobile. Brenton Netz has made a side business out of fixing up Geo Metros and selling them locally and on eBay. But Marci Solomon is hoping she'll be the one laughing -- all the way to the bank -- when her Geo Metro saves her from skyrocketing gas prices. Solomon, like many others, was taking a huge hit when it came to gas prices. With her 100-mile commute to and from work each day, she saw no end in sight. Then she rediscovered the Geo Metro. ""I used to be a car snob, and I used to be too vain to drive anything that doesn't shine,"" said Solomon, an electrician. ""But now it's about, do I want to eat, or do I want to make it to work? I want to do both."" The Metro has been making a huge comeback, especially on eBay, where Solomon bought the car, because of its extremely high gas mileage. The 1996 Metro's average of 40 miles per gallon nears that of the hybrid 2008 Toyota Prius -- priced at $21,000 for the cheapest model -- and bests most current cars by a long shot, according to government ratings. Older models of the Geo Metro, specifically cars from 1991 and the XFi edition, have the same average as the hybrid.  See how the Geo Metro stacks up with the Toyota Prius » . Solomon toyed with the idea of purchasing a Prius but decided that for a price of $7,300, the Metro was the more economical option. For the most part, Solomon plans on using the car for commuting from her home in Rochester, Washington, to her job. The vehicle she has now, a Honda Element, was getting 28 mpg, and she was filling up twice a week, costing her nearly $100. Stations were charging $3.97 a gallon in her area Tuesday, she said. iReport: Tell us how high gas prices are affecting you . The Metro is an investment in the future, Solomon said, even if she did pay more than five times the Blue Book value of the car. ""It was all about saving money,"" she said. ""I don't think gas is ever going to go down, and these are going to be the types of solutions we have to turn to. I wanted to beat the rush."" The rush may have begun. The 1996 2-door 3-cylinder Metro Solomon now owns opened on eBay May 7 with a bid of $200. A week later, Solomon won the car auction with a bid of $7,300. In 1995, a new Metro hatchback sold for about $9,000, according to Auto Mall USA. In May alone, 43 Metros of various years and models were sold on eBay, ranging in price from $221.50 to Solomon's bid of $7,300. The cars have been hot items, drawing upwards of 49 bids on certain vehicles, with many of the auctions coming down to last-second bidding wars. On Tuesday morning, 34 Metros were still up for grabs. Since her eBay purchase, Solomon has acquired another Metro, which she is considering flipping on eBay for profit. She has her eye on a third at a local car lot. ""To be honest, I'm thinking of scarfing up any Geo Metro I can find,"" she said. Solomon isn't alone in trying to profit off of a gas-saving craze. Brenton Netz has been selling fixed-up Metros and Ford Festivas for two years now. After buying a Metro on Craigslist in Montana and driving it back to his home in St. Cloud, Minnesota, Netz realized how rarely he was making trips to the pump. ""I thought the gas gauge was broken,"" Netz said. ""I couldn't believe the gas mileage I was getting."" He realized that he had stumbled upon a possible side business and began buying one-way tickets to states in the West to purchase as many of the cars as he could. Netz said he has sold about a dozen cars and has eight more sitting in his backyard. His cars go up for sale only one at a time because he knows that putting up a couple at a time would drive down the value and cut into his profit. Netz says consumers don't seem to mind paying more than the retail value, and if they do, they generally stop feeling that way after they pick up the cars. He's gotten phone calls and e-mails from customers saying how thrilled they are with the mileage. It seems, Netz said, people are beginning to realize that their car choices need to be focused more on practicality than status and appearance. ""Gas prices are definitely driving increased popularity in the Metro, which at times wasn't cool,"" he said. ""Now the coolness factor is stemming from the fact that you're getting 50 miles per gallon and never having to fill up.""","Marci Solomon bought 1996 Geo Metro for $7,300 .

"(CNN) -- In the years before penicillin came into wide use in the 1940s, medicine couldn't do very much for many of the sickest patients. A hospital could keep you warm and provide food and nursing care, but as surgeon and writer Atul Gawande pointed out, in many cases the patient would do no better than if he or she had stayed home. In those days, doctors who mastered the few techniques that could make a difference, such as setting fractures and treating certain kinds of heart conditions, were seemingly all-powerful, Gawande told the TED2012 conference in March. ""A doctor could kind of know it all and do it all,"" he said in an interview with CNN following his talk. Doctors were rewarded for being cowboys, for being daring and self sufficient. Today, the world of medicine promises and provides much more -- cures and care for many of the worst health problems people have. But doctors can no longer know everything and do everything. As medical knowledge has exploded, doctors increasingly must specialize in a field to absorb all the relevant information to treat a certain kind of illness. And a patient who goes to a hospital often winds up being treated and cared for by as many as 15 doctors, nurses and therapists, Gawande said. The result? ""Well, it's been a disaster,"" he said. ""We have 40 percent of coronary artery disease patients who receive incomplete or inappropriate care, we have 2 million people pick up infections in hospitals because one of those people on that team failed to follow basic hygiene practices."" Watch Atul Gawande's TED Talk . ""Holding on to our streak of autonomy, each of us, we end up losing the patient in between,"" he said. Gawande, a surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, also is a researcher at Harvard University and a writer at The New Yorker. Today doctors are still often rewarded and trained as cowboys, but Gawande says what we really need are doctors who can function as members of a team, the way those in an auto racing pit crew work together to get vehicles back in the race. Ted.com: Trial, error and the God complex . Gawande has been a pioneer in advocating the use of checklists by medical teams working together in surgery or on other procedures. ""We've had checklists in medicine for people we considered the lowest on the totem pole, but the idea that the surgeon would have to follow a checklist is anathema,"" Gawande said. But in fact, he added, ""when checklists have been used to make sure even the best, most specialized doctors don't miss key steps in providing care ... we're finding that carefully designed checklists cut death rates in half in surgeries, that they can eliminate certain kinds of infections and that they can slash costs."" Gawande has found reason to question the assumption that the most expensive care must be the best care. ""What we're discovering is that the best care, the places getting the best results, are often among the least expensive,"" he said. In those places, doctors and nurses providing care function like teams. ""We are going through a dramatic change where it's no longer about what your doctor knows, it's about what a team of doctors, nurses and others are able to do together."" TED.com: Doctors make mistakes -- can we talk about that? These days Gawande brings a checklist with him into the operating room. At first, it was a bit of a shock for him. ""I did it reluctantly. I have been someone who believes, you know, do I need a checklist? No ... but i didn't want to be a hypocrite. I was bringing them to Tanzania and Seattle, so I started using a checklist myself. So that meant before the patient went to sleep we would do a series of checks -- not just, 'Do we have the right person and the right side of the body?' But also, 'Do we have a plan for what happens if this is a high-blood-loss case?' ""Before the incision, we'd introduce ourselves by name because it would turn out often that you would have a team of people working together for the first time who may not know each other very well. ""We discuss the plan in detail, and in doing these things I found from the very beginning that we were catching problems that we were missing otherwise. The anesthesiologist or the nurse was noticing things that I had missed. ""I have not gotten through a week of surgery in three years using this kind of checklist without it catching something that was a danger for the patient or would have made the care better.""","Atul Gawande: Medicine developed around the idea of the ""cowboy"" doctor .
He says today's doctors don't know it all; they have to specialize and be part of a team .

"(CNN) -- George Bernard Shaw is said to have once written, ""Progress is impossible without change, and those who cannot change their minds cannot change anything."" There's no doubting ol' George would be drubbed as a ""flip-flopper"" if he were to set foot in a modern political campaign (after denying he ever said that, of course). But humans must think there's something to it. We've been changing our minds forever, right? So, lest Ohio Sen. Rob Portman think he's out there on his own in deciding he was wrong about gay marriage, here are a few examples of some famous changes of heart, both real and imagined: . Bill Clinton: From Burger-Eater-in-Chief to Vegan . From French fries to fried chicken, the former president's appetite was legendary. White House pastry chef Roland Mesnier had another world for it, he told Washingtonian magazine: ""Scary."" ""He had a big appetite, scary,"" the magazine quoted Mesnier as saying. ""He could eat five or six pork chops."" He loved the food at the White House so much, in fact, he gained 18 pounds between 1997 and 1999. But a few years ago, Clinton went almost entirely vegan after two bouts of heart surgery. No more cheeseburgers, no milkshakes. No eggs. ""I essentially concluded that I had played Russian roulette,"" Clinton told CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta in 2011. ""I was lucky I did not die of a heart attack,"" he said. That nameless hater of green eggs and ham . He does not like them, Sam-I-am. That's what the shaggy, black-hatted thing in Dr. Seuss' legendary childrens' book tells hardcore ham-and- enthusiast Sam-I-Am. Finally, worn down by Sam-I-Am's relentless badgering, the creature -- worn down -- finally relents. ""If you will let me be, I will try them, you will see."" A bit of munching, then ... ""Say, I like green eggs and ham! I do! I like them Sam-I-Am!"" The same cannot, unfortunately, be said of the millions of children whose well-meaning parents have invoked Sam to get their children to eat vegetables. They still won't eat them. Not even on a goat. Brett Favre: I'm retired. No I'm not. I'm retired. No I'm not . In 2008, the Green Bay Packers quarterback decided to call it a career after 17 seasons, saying he'd had a good run but that ""all good things must come to an end."" ""I know I can play, but I don't think I want to,"" he told reporters. But within a month, he'd had a change of heart and said he wanted to come back. Then he didn't. Then he wanted back in. The Packers, exasperated, finally offered Favre a contract just to agree to stay retired. He refused and was eventually traded to the New York Jets, where he played for a season, then retired. Again. Until he had a change of heart and came back to play for the Minnesota Vikings. An ankle injury ended that comeback. As of this writing, at least, the future Hall of Famer is still retired. Ebenezer Scrooge: After sleeping on it ... When the world first met Ebenezer Scrooge in 1843, it was as a miserly skinflint whose tightwad ways made him a virtual ghost among the merrymaking men and women of Victorian London. He was uncaring to the concerns of others that he'd just as well see the poor die off to, as he would say, ""decrease the surplus population."" But, after a series of spectral visits in which he is shown Christmases past and present and learns of the dismal fate awaiting him in death, author Charles Dickens has his Scrooge awake a new man, throwing money around as if it were candy and making as merry as he could for the rest of his days.

Back in 1930, the scientists who thought about such things decided a newly discovered thing way out in the distant solar system was a planet, and decided to name it Pluto. But little Pluto didn't even get through one of its 248-year trips around the sun before Earth's scientists changed their mind. A mere 76 years after earthlings first spied the planet in the black of space, they changed their collective minds. Too small, the scientists said. Too erratic. We found something bigger farther out. Heck, Pluto's only twice as big as its moon! It's certainly not the only time scientists have changed their minds. But it's one that's captured plenty of the public's imagination.

"(CNN) -- Hackney Wick is nestled next to the Olympic site, separated only by a waterway known as the Lee Navigation. It is a half industrial, half artistic enclave, little known to Londoners, but which has, in recent years, become rich in street art from a cast of artists who have been integral to regenerating east London and informing its cultural identity. With the Olympics now underway, Hackney Wick can been seen as a microcosm highlighting the forces that street art faces across east London. Street art meets Locog . The Olympics organizing committee, LOCOG, has been asked to deliver a long-remembered games, and multifaceted legacy for London. This is no easy task. Read more: Why gritty East End is London's gold standard . Unfortunately it has failed, overwhelmingly, to engage with London's street artists. It seems the cultural thinking behind London 2012 is being carried out from within an impenetrable ivory tower, with scant access granted to decision makers. In essence, there has been a top-down imposition of what LOCOG thinks is the relevant cultural identity of London -- and this has been presented to the world. To many in east London, where the Olympic Park is located, this imposition feels alien. It feels akin to a form of cultural imperialism, out of synch with the true culture, including street art which may be found just a stone's throw from the Olympic Stadium. Missed opportunities . Politicians and officials talk about London 2012 using words like ""regeneration"" and ""legacy."" Such aims are a key reason behind London winning the Games, and the ideas are laudable. Read more: London's docks turn into 'mini Monaco' for Olympics . But by not engaging with London's street artists, LOCOG has arguably missed an opportunity to be more culturally relevant and connect with artists who are a real transformative force. From a purely cultural standpoint, this is a shame. London boasts some of the finest street art in the world from fresh and exciting artists such as Stik, RUN, Ben Eine, David Walker, Pablo Delgado, Christiaan Nagel and Cityzen Kane. London is also a global street art hub, welcoming artists from all over the world. People also come from all over to see London's street art. The diversity and vibrancy of London's street art is staggering, and celebrating this would have shown vision. Read more: The artist who turned Usain Bolt from track legend to street hero . Perhaps more importantly, LOCOG's spurning of the street art scene counteracts one of east London's key regenerative forces. Street art brings energy to the streets and infuses color onto gray and dilapidated walls. Street art has fostered community spirit and made east Londoners proud of where they live too. This is the very thing alchemists within LOCOG are trying to deliver as part of London 2012's legacy. Public art . Many of London's street artists view themselves as servants to their local communities, and maintain close connections with them. They depend on their communities for patronage and support for wall space. As such, London's street art can be defined as public art for the city's people. Around east London, in particular, the local populace has taken street art to its heart with many locals familiar with each of the different artists at work on the street. Today's generation often work in daylight hours doing legal walls. They are happy to reveal their identities and also to stop and chat with people passing by in the street while they work. It's sometimes hard for bureaucrats to understand this, so truly ingrained is the media-driven paradigm of all street artists being mischief-makers who put up numerous illegal socio-political stencils in the night. East London's local councils are, however, actually starting to understand street art's evolving nature and its importance to east London's spirit. Legal pieces are routinely left alone by councils now, and this has largely been the case in Hackney Wick. Pieces still get buffed by over zealous clean up crews but reports of a pre-Olympics war on street art are a little overplayed. The greatest threats to the street art in Hackney Wick are now arguably from companies like Coca-Cola painting over local artists with ""cool"" Olympic themed murals. Read more: Is the Olympics worth more than Google? What legacy? Street art is an important part of east London's identity and a positive force for regeneration. Street art has been dismissed and misunderstood by London bureaucracies in the past, and LOCOG's attitude is no different. However we hope it will not always be this way. Changes in attitude and policy will of course take time and by the time the Olympics visits London again perhaps we will be ready. We are seeing encouraging green shoots every day. CNN asked Locog to respond to the opinions expressed by Howard-Griffin. Here is their response: . The London 2012 Festival has 25,000 artists taking part in more than 12,000 events across the UK in the largest cultural celebration every seen in this country. Our program in east London has already seen 100,000 people enjoy artists such as Rhianna, Jay-Z, Jessie J and many more as part of the free BBC Radio 1 Hackney Weekend. People are currently a visiting a car park in East London where an exhibition of BMW Art Cars, designed by artists including David Hockney, Jeff Koons, Roy Lichtenstein, and Andy Warhol, is being staged. Rio and London carnival artists collaborated for the Hackney One Carnival to welcome the Olympic Torch Relay, screenings of restored Hitchcock films at east London venues and a fantastic program of theater, dance and outdoor events at the Barbican and with the Create festival. The London 2012 Festival is a UK wide festival, and we are very excited about the upcoming London 2012 Festival event ""See No Evil 2012: Urban Festival"" in Bristol. This is the UK's largest permanent street art project and the biggest urban arts festival in Europe, attracting the world's leading urban artists to converge and create a series of temporary and permanent street art installations and sculpture, including some of the world's largest scale outdoor paintings. For the first time it will bring together two major international artists, Adrian Utley of Portishead and French artist, Joanie Lemercier of cutting 3D projection experts AntiVJ. They will create a free, one off cross art-form performance, featuring huge scale digital projections and live music in the centre of Bristol from 13 -- 19 August 2012.

"Los Angeles (CNN) -- If you are parked in front of your TV to watch the Grammys, you only saw a fraction of what happened at the annual music awards show Sunday. In fact, 70 of the 81 trophies were handed out in a pre-telecast ceremony in the Nokia Theatre L.A. LIVE, next to the Staples Center where the last 11 Grammys were presented between a record 20 star-studded performances. Plenty of action takes place backstage where the winners go to talk after they leave the stage, as well. There were hints backstage that the Zac Brown Band, which claimed the best country album Grammy, may be veering into other music genres. ""I love great music of all different kinds,"" Zac Brown said. ""We're just getting started. One project ahead is an acoustic album, Brown said. ""We really control all of our destiny now and all of our rights to everything we do now, so we can really experiment,"" he said. He especially enjoyed the Grammy performances of Rihanna, Sting, Justin Timberlake and Kelly Clarkson, Brown said. Brown used the Grammy weekend to develop relationships with other artists. ""My rolodex got strong this weekend,"" He said. After Carrie Underwood won her sixth Grammy, the latest for best country solo performance, she made it clear backstage that she's sticking to country music and would never cross over into pop music. ""I love that world,"" Underwood said. ""I love the people in it. I love making country music that anybody can get into. If it ever crosses over, then it does it on its on. I don't think I can see myself making a pop album."" We learned backstage why Jay-Z teased The Dream about the ""Boyz in the Hood"" he was wearing when they accepted their Grammy for best rap/sung collabotation. ""I would like to thank the swap meet for his hat,"" Jay-Z said in his acceptance. ""He was just digging on me,"" The Dream explained backstage. ""Yeah, we do that."" The trigger for the kiddng was that Jay-Z's wife, Beyonce, had just said she wanted the hat. And in fact, he bought the cap at a swap meet in Compton, Caifornia, he said. The Dream also revealed he would fly to Paris soon to work on an album with Kanye West, who shared the collaboration Grammy with him. ""Hopefully we can get another Grammy together,"" he said. The televised presentations target pop, country, urban, rock, and rap categories, leaving the jazz, gospel, classical, Latin and other categories to the pre-show. The Nokia Theatre was far from full, because many of the 754 individual nominees and their teams were on the red carpet or still getting ready for the big show while the pre-show was under way. But if you were there for the pre-show -- or watched it streamed online -- you would have heard Rihanna, Drake, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Usher, Beyonce and Paul McCartney win Grammys. You still would not have seen them, however, because those stars were not present to accept. You would have seen Taylor Swift making an effort to appear excited and surprised as she accepted a Grammy for best song written for visual media. She won it because she was a co-writer of ""Safe & Sound,"" a song made for ""The Hunger Games"" film. ""This is unbelievable!"" Swift exclaimed. It was her sixth Grammy in her young career. The Beach Boys' Brian Wilson also took the pre-telecast stage to accept the Grammy for best historical album. He co-produced ""The Smile Sessions,"" a resurrection of an abandoned Beach Boys album project from 45 years ago. He hinted that the Beach Boys have ""a lot of stuff in the can that hasn't been heard"" and that the group would ""try to get an album together"" this year. Wilson, 70, appeared frail, requiring two men to walk on each side backstage. Janis Ian, another major star from the past, was there to accept a Grammy. Ian called it a ""big upset"" when she beat first lady Michelle Obama, former President Bill Clinton, Ellen DeGeneres and Rachel Maddow in the best spoken word category. ""I keep thinking there must be a punchline here,"" Ian joked. ""An ex-president and the first lady and three lesbians walk into a bar."" Ian won for narrating ""Society's Child: My Autobiography."" It was just her second Grammy after nine nominations in eight different categories. ""I made a choice to be a songwriter and not be part of the circus all the time. I don't do popular music because that's not what I'm good at,"" Ian said backstage. Bonnie Raitt was there to get her 10th Grammy, the latest for best Americana album given for ""Slipstream."" ""I didn't expect this,"" Raitt said. ""I have enough."" Jazz legend Pat Metheny took home his 20th Grammy out of 36 nominated. The latest for best jazz instrumental album, given to him for ""Unity Band."" Esperanza Spalding, the bass-playing jazz singer whose best new artist win upset Justin Bieber fans two years ago, was present to win two more Grammys in the pre-telecast. Spalding, 28, won for best instrumental arrangement accompanying vocalists and for best jazz vocal album for ""Radio Music Society."" Drake, whom Spalding also beat two years ago for best new artist, may now wish he had been there because the rapper was awarded his first Grammy after 13 nominations. Then again, he also lost twice Sunday when Jay-Z and Kanye West beat him in the best rap song and best rap performance categories. Paul McCartney was a no-show to pick up his Grammy for best traditional pop vocal album. It was awarded for his ""Kisses on the Bottom"" album. While there are plenty of household names announced in the pre-show, it is also the chance for the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences to honor people who perform important jobs for the music industry. For example, Billy Vera won a Grammy for writing the best album notes. He composed the notes for an album of Ray Charles music, ""Singular Genius: The Complete ABC Singles."" Fritz Klaetke, the art director for ""Woody At 100: The Woody Guthrie Centennial Collection,"" won a Grammy for producing the best boxed or special limited edition package. While this may seem to be the most unglamorous of all Grammys, Klaetke said the category was important for ""recognizing the role packaging design plays in these days of downloaded music.""","NEW: Best country album winner Zac Brown hints his band may try new music .

"(CNN) -- Where ""global knowledge"" was once essential for leaders, IBM's 2010 Global CEO Study cited ""creativity"" as the most important leadership quality for the future. This is one of many signals that the business world is evolving out of the ""Information Age,"" where left-brain technical skills, knowledge and expertise were king. In ""A Whole New Mind: Why Right Brainers Will Rule the Future,"" Daniel H. Pink asserts that current global conditions -- abundance, Asian outsourcing, and automation -- are setting the stage for a brand new era: the ""Conceptual Age."" As employees chart their route to the top in this new era, it's important to know the skills that companies are looking for. In the Conceptual Age, right-brain skills will be key. Given the velocity of change and the complexity that results from this, we need to go beyond just knowledge or expertise. The best employees of the future will excel at creative problem solving and different ways of thinking -- synthesizing seemingly diverse things together for better solutions, using metaphors to explain new ideas for which no context yet might exist. See also: Why your career is a work in progress . This is partly because the amount of new information about any given subject is constantly increasing. Tomorrow's companies will need to take a creative-thinking approach to the sea of knowledge, bridging the gap between analytical, left-brain functions and creative, right-brain capabilities. My new book, ""Kill the Company,"" identifies the most critical skills of the Conceptual Age -- and simple ways to cultivate them before it's too late: . 1. Strategic Imagination refers to ""dreaming with purpose."" Today's employee is so mired in busywork that their ability to think long-term has waned. But employees of tomorrow must learn to actively imagine future possibilities and create scenarios to act on them. Seek out resources that fuel future thinking, such as LongBets.com, Springwise.com, and NewScientist.com. Challenge yourself to envision your business unit in the year 2020. Even better, draw your vision -- create a magazine cover, an organizational chart, etc. -- as a visual representation of what the future might look like. 2. The ability to ask smart and often unsettling questions is known as Provocative Inquiry. Transformative power lies in asking questions that make us rethink the obvious. In the healthcare industry, for example, it can be seen in the shift from curing illness to preventing it via wellness services. To unearth new answers to existing business problems, learn to ask better questions -- ones that make other team members really stop and think. For example, ""What are the unshakable beliefs about client/customer needs in our industry ... what if the opposite were true?"" and ""Which competitors could eat our lunch tomorrow and what are we doing about it?"" By encouraging curiosity, you fan the fires that create new ideas and improve current offerings. 3. The quick and obvious strategy will not survive the fierce competition of the Conceptual Age. Employees will need to continually exercise their Creative Problem Solving skills, the application of best practices from unexpected sources to create fresh solutions. In the consumer product category, James Dyson exemplifies this skill. Dyson applied the mechanics of a local sawmill -- a giant cyclone-shaped dust collector -- and invented the best-selling vacuum in the UK. Hone this reflex by utilizing an exercise called ""RE:think."" Take an everyday object (paper clip, scissors, etc.) and pretend you've never encountered it before. What does this new product do? What are its benefits and who would use it? Activities like Re:think can strengthen your ability to approach problems in unconventional ways. See also: Have you got the career X-Factor? 4. Keeping pace with change is a challenge, yet meeting unexpected situations with quick thinking and resourcefulness is the very definition of Agility. In a world where change is the only constant, a Plan B -- and C, D, and E -- is truly critical. Cultivate the mindset of preparedness by creating ""Wild Card"" scenarios. Using a current project you're working on, challenge yourself to meet your current goals despite wild cards that might occur -- such as ""50% less budget"" or ""half the R&D time"" or ""severely restrained resources or technology."" Planning for success under constraint helps you learn agility and prepare for change before it is forced upon you unexpectedly. 5. Building on agility, employees will also need to demonstrate Resilience, which translates to tenacity and courage in the face of obstacles. People who are undaunted will give their organizations a competitive edge in the Conceptual Age. Learn to overcome barriers by practicing the art of ""Impossible to Possible."" Write answers to these questions: What would a customer say we should do for them but never would? What would make us the industry leader -- although hell would have to freeze over for it to happen? What impossible thing would make your job infinitely better? Once you've made a list, find a way to turn the list of impossible things into possibilities. This exercise truly awakens the competitive spirit and gives rise to a solution-driven mindset. The business world is at a critical inflection point and to compete in tomorrow's market, today's companies must demonstrate more than knowledge or technical expertise: they must cultivate new skill sets. The valued leaders and successful employees of the Conceptual Age will be firing on all cylinders -- and many will involve right-brain functions. To avoid extinction, employees must embody the kind of daily future thinking that will enable their teams and organizations to conceptualize -- and handle -- the blessings and burdens of a new era. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lisa Bodell.","Lisa Bodell says the best employees of the future will excel at creative problem solving .

"(CNN) -- A Carnival cruise ship in the Gulf of Mexico will need to be towed to port after an engine fire, a cruise line official said Sunday. The Carnival Triumph was in waters off the Yucatan Peninsula, heading back to Galveston, Texas, when the fire occurred Sunday morning, said Astevia Gonzalez from the Carnival Cruises family support team. The ship's automatic fire extinguishing system kicked in and soon contained the blaze, and no injuries were reported. The fire still left the ship and its more than 3,000 passengers and 1,000 crew members without propulsion, leaving it drifting about 140 miles off the Mexican coast, the cruise line said in a statement. ""The ship's technical crew has determined the vessel will need to be towed to port,"" Carnival said around 7:30 p.m. ET Sunday. ""A tugboat is en route to the ship's location and will tow the vessel to Progreso, Mexico, which is the closest port."" According to Gonzalez, the ship is expected to arrive in port Wednesday. She said that passengers were never without electricity, thanks to emergency generators, and have ample food and water onboard. Even more food and beverages were being transferred Sunday night onto the Triumph from one of its sister ships, the Carnival Elation, which was on scene. The Coast Guard said Sunday night that its officials are communicating with the ship's crew, adding that its Cutter Vigorous should arrive on-site early Monday morning. After they are towed to Progreso, those aboard the Carnival Triumph will be flown back to the United States at no cost to them, the cruise line said. They will also get a full refund, credit that can be used toward a future trip and reimbursement for all expenses -- except casino and gift shop purchases -- for their current trip. The vessel's next two departures, scheduled for Monday and Saturday, have been canceled. Those slated to be on those trips will get full refunds and discounts toward future cruises, the cruise line said. Read also: 5 killed during safety drill .

"(CNN) -- The U.N. Security Council is expected to meet Tuesday to consider a proposed resolution to authorize more sanctions against North Korea following the secretive regime's controversial nuclear test last month. Pyongyang said the underground nuclear blast it conducted on February 12 was more powerful than its two previous detonations and used a smaller, lighter device, suggesting advances in its weapons program. It was the first nuclear test the isolated state has carried out since its young leader, Kim Jong Un, inherited power in December 2011 after the death of his father, Kim Jong Il, who made building up North Korea's military strength the focus of his 17-year rule. Like the regime's previous tests in 2006 and 2009, the move prompted widespread international condemnation, as well as a promise of tough action at the United Nations. The United States and China, a key North Korean ally, have been negotiating for weeks on the wording of the proposed resolution. China's 'dissatisfaction' Beijing's government on Tuesday said it strives for a ""nuclear free peninsula."" It repeated its support for the U.N. Security Council's condemnation of North Korea's nuclear tests but also called for a muted response to it. ""China suggests the UNSC to keep a discreet, proper reaction to avoid the situation from escalating,"" the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said at a media briefing Tuesday. North Korea's government regularly rails vehemently against sanctions imposed on it. As a permanent member of the Security Council with veto power, China can strongly influence the body's decisions and has previously resisted strong sanctions on the Kim regime, which it props up economically. The two communist countries have been close allies, since China backed the North in the Korean War in the 1950s. The United States backed the South in the conflict, fighting side by side with its troops. The two Koreas are still officially in a state of war, though an armistice signed in 1953 ended the bloodshed. Analysts say Beijing wants to maintain the North as a buffer between its border and South Korea, a U.S. ally. Immediately after Pyongyang's nuclear test, Beijing expressed its ""dissatisfaction,"" noting that it took place ""despite the international community's widespread opposition."" Details of the proposed resolution remained unclear late Monday in New York. Russia, another veto holder, will support a resolution on North Korea if it doesn't go beyond ""missile and nuclear issues,"" Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Gennady Gatilov said Tuesday, according to the Russian news agency Interfax. ""A text focused on missile and nuclear issues linked to North Korea will be acceptable for us,"" Gatilov told Interfax. The meeting Tuesday at which the text is expected to be presented is set to begin at 11 a.m., according to the U.N. media office. A previous Security Council resolution in January that broadened sanctions on North Korea in response to a long-range rocket launch angered Pyongyang. Two days after that resolution was passed, the regime announced it would carry out the nuclear test. The rocket launch in December apparently succeeded in putting a satellite in orbit, a move North Korea said was for peaceful purposes. But the launch was widely considered to be a test of ballistic missile technology. Pyongyang has said its nuclear tests and other weapons programs are a deterrent against the United States and its allies. But North Korean state media regularly publish articles directing aggressive rhetoric against Washington and Seoul. ""North Korea's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs constitute a threat to U.S. national security and to international peace and security,"" President Barack Obama said after the North's nuclear test last month. CNN's Alla Eshchenko contributed to this report.","NEW: China expresses its support for U.N. condemnation but wants a muted reaction .

"Dhaka, Bangladesh (CNN) -- Bangladeshi President Mohammad Zillur Rahman died Wednesday at a Singapore hospital, where he was being treated for a lung infection, an official with his office said. He was 84. Rahman was admitted to Mount Elizabeth Hospital on March 10. He died there Wednesday afternoon, according to the official, Mohammad Shafiul Alam. He had been taken from the Bangladeshi capital, Dhaka, to Singapore by air ambulance after his health deteriorated and was suffering from acute kidney and respiratory problems when he died. Bangladesh is a parliamentary democracy, meaning the role of the president is largely ceremonial. The president is elected by the parliament, while the prime minister is chosen in a general election. Rahman, of the ruling Awami League, was elected to the position in 2009, becoming the 19th president of Bangladesh. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and others offered their condolences on Rahman's death. Independence struggle . Born in 1929 in the Kishoreganj district of Bangladesh, Rahman became involved in politics when he was a student at Dhaka University. He played a significant role in the country's war of independence in 1971 and was a close aide to the country's founder, President Sheikh Mujibur Rahman. Mohammad Zillur Rahman became a member of the Provincial Assembly of East Pakistan, now Bangladesh, in 1970 and was elected a member of parliament five times after his country's independence. As a senior figure in the Awami League, he was imprisoned for four years after the assassination of Sheikh Mujibur Rahman in 1975. He was again detained in 1986. He served twice as the general secretary for the Awami League, which won a landslide victory in the 2008 general elections. Zillur Rahman's wife, Ivy Rahman, also an Awami League politician, was killed in grenade attacks on a party rally in Dhaka that left 24 people dead and more than 200 injured in August 2004.

"(EW.com) -- What's happening to ""Modern Family?"" Earlier this season, the acclaimed ABC series was the highest-rated comedy on TV. But CBS' Thursday king ""The Big Bang Theory"" has since climbed to top the weekly chart hitting recent season highs, and Modern Family has slipped to No. 2 and relinquished its crown. Last night's episode marks a season low for the show, down 10 percent to 10.1 million viewers and a 3.8 adults 18-49 rating. What's behind the slippage? Well, its ABC neighbors sure don't help much (or rather, its ""Neighbors""). And ""Modern Family"" now has to contend with Fox's ""American Idol,"" which has likely had an impact the past few weeks (one analyst noted that Modern Family tends to hit its low point around this time of year). Of course, ""Big Bang"" airs at 8 p.m. so it doesn't even have a lead-in, also faces ""Idol,"" plus is an older show. Thor's hammer? Scientist estimates weight . Perhaps it's that ""Modern Family"" is rather ambitious and creatively complex with a large cast that seeks to work as a comedy with tinges of deeply heartfelt drama â€” pulling all that off week after week is huge juggling act. The rest of ABC's lineup had mixed results. ""The Middle"" was down 8 percent. ""The Neighbors"" was up 13 percent and ""Suburgatory"" went up 17 percent (thanks to Modern Family not running a repeat this week). Kristen Stewart sizes up 'Big Shoe' role . On CBS, ""Criminal Minds"" tied its series low; ""CSI"" dropped 8 percent despite airing its well-promoted ""CSI: NY"" cross-over episode. Fox's ""Idol"" led the night yet fell 16 percent for the start of Hollywood Rounds. NBC was largely down about 10 percent except ""Guys With Kids"" which fluxed up a tenth. On The CW, ""Arrow"" rose a notch and ""Supernatural"" was flat. See the original article at EW.com.

"(CNN) -- China's economic growth rose in the fourth quarter of 2012, helping the world's most populous nation end the year with a growth rate of 7.8%, according to figures released Friday from the National Bureau of Statistics. Last quarter, China's economy grew at a pace of 7.9%, slightly better than analyst expectations and breaking a pattern of seven straight quarters of decline. China's growth rate had been steadily falling since the fourth quarter of 2010, when economic output grew 9.8%. The slowing growth rate bottomed out in the third quarter of 2012, when China's economy only grew at 7.4%. Last March, Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao lowered the country's 2012 growth target from 8% to 7.5%. While such growth would be the envy of most nations, China's economy has grown at an average rate of about 10% each year for the past 30 years. This has helped propel China to become the world's second largest economy, just behind that of the United States. China's leaders are widely expected to maintain its 7.5% growth target into 2013. Adding to Friday's better-than-expected growth figures, China's industrial production increased to 10.3% year-on-year versus expectations of 10.2% growth. Retail sales rose 15.2% year-on-year, also a 0.1% point increase over expectations.","China's economy grew 7.9% in the fourth quarter, slightly better than expectations .

"Washington (CNN) -- Welfare reform, which added a work requirement tied to welfare benefits, is often cited as a major bipartisan political success of President Bill Clinton's second term. So the idea of the next Democratic president, Barack Obama, taking the work requirement off the table is political dynamite. Apparently, the Romney campaign believes it is. A Romney campaign ad titled ""Welfare Reform,"" which came out earlier in August, says that's just what Obama did. ""On July 12, President Obama quietly ended the work requirement, gutting welfare reform. One of the most respected newspapers in the country called it 'nuts,' "" the ad says. ""Under Obama's plan, you wouldn't have to work and you wouldn't have to train for a job,"" the ad continues. ""They just send you your welfare check. And welfare to work goes back to being plain old welfare ..."" But the Obama campaign calls Romney's ad ""nuts."" CNN's Fact-check agrees. Clinton calls out 'disappointing' Romney ad . ""Every single person here who's looked at it says it's patently false,"" Obama said a news conference on Monday. So where did the notion of a major welfare reform overhaul come from? Where it didn't come from is Washington but rather from Utah, Nevada, California, Connecticut and Minnesota. These states, some with Republican governors, asked the federal government for more flexibility in how they hand out welfare dollars. Their purpose was to spend less time on federal paperwork and more time experimenting with ways to connect welfare recipients with jobs. The Obama administration cooperated, granting waivers to some states from some of the existing rules. The waivers gave ""those states some flexibility in how they manage their welfare rolls as long as it produced 20% increases in the number of people getting work."" In some small way, the waivers might change precisely how work is calculated but the essential goal of pushing welfare recipients to work -- something both Democrats and Republicans agreed to in the 1990s -- remains the same.","Romney ad claims that Obama has ""gutted"" welfare reform .
