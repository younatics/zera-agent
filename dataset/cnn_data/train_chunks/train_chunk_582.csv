Sarah Collins Rudolph, who was the lone survivor of a 1963 Alabama church bombing that killed four black girls, is seeking millions in compensation and says she won't accept a top congressional award to honor the victims. Mrs Rudolph said that she feels forgotten more than 50 years after the bombing at Birmingham’s Sixteenth Street Baptist Church on September 16, 1963. Her sister, Addie Mae Collins, 14, as well as 14-year-olds Carole Robertson and Cynthia Wesley, and 11-year-old Denise McNair were killed in the blast in the ladies’ room in the church basement. They were later eulogized by Dr Martin Luther King Jr. Scroll down for video . Justice: Sarah Collins Rudolph, pictured a few years ago, is seeking millions in compensation for the September 1963 church bombing that killed her sister, Addie, and took her right eye . Remuneration: Mrs Rudolph, right, and Fate Morris, whose sister died in the blast, discuss their desire for compensation from the bombing during an interview in Birmingham, Alabama, today . Speaking with the Associated Press today, Mrs Rudolph said that no one seems to remember the Alabama blast that took the lives of the four girls, as well as her own eye – and is seeking untold millions in restitution. The bomb was planted by white supremacist Robert Chambliss, Tomas Blanton Jr. and later Bobby Frank Cherry. A fourth conspirator, Herman Frank Cash, died in 1994. But, as the New York Times noted in a 2002 article, justice has been even slower than Mrs Rudoph’s recovery. Cherry was 71 when he was finally convicted in 2002; Chamblis was charged in 1977, and Blanton in 2001. Each were in the Ku Klux Klan. In an interview with NPR earlier this year, Mrs Collins spoke of the horror of that September day and the terror she experienced. ‘I was standing there, just bleeding,’ she told the station. ‘Somebody came and they just picked me up and took me out through the hole and put me in (an) ambulance.’ Deadly: A large crater was all that remained of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church basement in Birmingham after a bomb exploded and killed four young black girls . Grim task: Firemen and ambulance attendants remove a covered body from Sixteenth Street Baptist Church, where the explosion ripped the structure during services . She was only 12 when she lost both her sister and her eye, and spent the following months recovering in a hospital, undergoing multiple surgeries to restore vision in her left eye. Some glass still remains embedded in the eye, as with her chest and abdomen, as doctors thought it too risky to remove. Mrs Rudolph, who lives in a ranch-style house just outside of Birmingham with her husband George, said that she has worked various blue-collar jobs throughout the years at steel mills, but that medical bills have slowly mounted. The survivor said that in 1963, counseling was not available to children in stressful events, and so she’s spent the past five decades dealing with severe post-traumatic stress. For decades, Mrs Rudolph refused to speak of the horrific event, but first opened up in 2002 after the last conspirator had been convicted. ‘The bomb blew a big crater through the building, and I was standing right there in front of it,’ she told Baylor magazine at the time. ‘I didn’t know which way to go.’ We shall overcome: A day after the bombing, Rev. Dr Martin Luther King, center, flanked by leaders Reverend Fred Shuttlesworth, right, and Dr. L.H. Pitts, left, calls on President Kennedy to send regular Army troops into the strife-torn city . Laid to rest: On September 17, 1963, mourners crowded the entrance to St. John's African Methodist Church as the casket containing the body of 14-year-old Carol Robertson from the church is carried out . Mrs Rudolph eventually returned to school, but was mocked because of her ill-fitting prosthetic eye, which would fall out upon the slightest false move. According to the magazine, she endured years of taunting and ridicule, and vowed not to go to college as a way to put an end to her torment. But she still suffers. ‘I still shake. I still jump when I hear loud sounds,’ she told NPR. ‘Every day I think about it, just looking in the mirror and seeing the scars of my face,’ she said, adding that looking at her scars proves a constant reminder of the bombing. She and her husband George went last October to the Birmingham City Council for help. But Mr Rudolph said that her attempts fell on deaf ears. Sole survivor: Ms Collins, 12, was temporarily blinded by glass and lost her right eye to it; she spent several months in the hospital . Mr Rudolph told NPR: ‘If you look back at the people in the (World Trade Center), each one of those victims got paid,’ he said. The mayor of Birmingham, William Bell, said at the time that while he appreciates the depth of Mrs Rudolph’s suffering, the city is simply not able to cut her a check for her pain. Though Congress is mulling over whether to award the Congressional Gold Medal to the four girls who were killed, . The brother of Cynthia Wesley, Fate Morris, told the AP that he too is not interested in the medal, Congress' highest honor.","Four black girls, aged 11-14, killed by white supremacists in September 16, 1963 bombing of Alabama church in Birmingham .

Two Oregon teens saved their father's life by lifting a 3,000-pound tractor off of him after the machinery flipped over and pinned him to the ground. Jeff Smith of Lebanon, Ore., said he was trying to pull a tree stump out of his garden when his boot slipped off the clutch and the tractor flipped on top of him, with the steering wheel pinning his chest to the ground. He immediately began screaming for help. 'It was scary because it was on my chest [and] every time I called out for help it was like a constrictor,' Smith explained to Portland NBC affiliate KGW.

For Jordan Arwood, the moment he lost his 6-year-old daughter and 7-year-old nephew despite his best effort to save them returns in waves. First it’s a wall of dirt collapsing and burying the two children in a backyard pit he was working on. Then it’s rescue workers frantically pulling the children from thick red clay. Their lifeless bodies placed in the back of an ambulance. 'When she came out of the hole she was so cold,' Arwood, of Stanley, North Carolina told The Associated Press in his first news media interview. Tragedy: Jordan Arwood is seen here with his 6-yer-old daughter Chloe Jade Arwood who was killed on Sunday along with her 7-year-old cousin . Recovered: The bodies of Chloe, left, and James Levi Caldwell, right, were found under about 24 feet of dirt in an excavated site on Monday . 'I just wanted for her to be warm. I . just wanted to put my arms around her and tell her she would be . safe....I promised her I'd keep her safe. I promised them I'd keep them . safe and warm. I broke that promise.' The 31-year-old was operating a backhoe Sunday night in the pit when the walls caved in on the children. The bodies of the two young cousins, Chloe Jade Arwood and James Levi Caldwell, were dug out Monday morning. Arwood is the girl's father. His parents, Nancy and Ken Caldwell, had adopted the boy, his twin sister Jazmin and 9-year-old brother Josiah. Arwood lives next to his parents and the pit was on his property. Arwood told the AP he reached out to save the children but they were just outside his grasp. He said he dug faster and faster trying to rescue them until he couldn't breathe. Covered: The pit, said to have been 20-by-20 feet, is seen after covered up following a 13-hour search for two young cousins . Buried: Authorities say the children were found under about 24 feet of dirt in this former excavated site near the Lucia community . 'When the wall came down, I kept grabbing . what was in front of me — grabbing enough dirt, grabbing boulders. ... I . wasn't going to stop until I pulled them out. But I couldn't save . them,' he said, sobbing. He paused for a moment. 'I wish it was me,' he said. Curiosity: Chloe Jade Arwood, seen holding a bird at their home last spring, was said to sometimes try to sneak into her father's construction site and try to help without warning . Lincoln County Sheriff's Office Detective Lt. Tim Johnson said investigators were interviewing family members and neighbors about the case. When they finished, they planned to present their findings to the district attorney's office. Investigators described the pit as 20 feet by 20 feet, with a sloped entrance leading down to the 24-foot bottom. The children were at the bottom of the pit retrieving a child-sized pickaxe when the walls fell in on them. No permits had been issued for Arwood to dig on the site. Johnson said investigators still don't know why Arwood was digging the hole and that people have speculated that the pit was everything from a 'doomsday bunker' to an underground structure for 'illegal activity,' such as growing marijuana. Sheriff's deputies on Monday removed . guns and a marijuana plant from Arwood's mobile home. Arwood is a felon . who is not allowed to have guns. He was convicted in 2003 for possession . of a controlled substance with intent to sell. Dion Burleson, spokesman for the Denver Fire Department, which responded to collapse, said crews filled in the pit Monday. Arwood . said he was building a rammed earth home, an ancient building method . where dirt is used to shape the foundation. Arwood said he had been . digging for three months. He said he was building it for his family's . future - to give them a safe, affordable eco-friendly home that would . last a generation. And he said there was nothing strange about it and . that people have been building rammed earth homes since the beginning of . civilization. He said he researched the permits and didn't believe he . needed one at that stage of construction. Support: Members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina, pray for the family of the two young children . Relief: Darrell Buchanan, whose wife is related to the family of the two young children, prays with members of the Adventure in Faith Church in Alexis, North Carolina on Monday . He also said he didn't expect the walls to collapse. And late Tuesday afternoon, Arwood walked to the site of the pit and pointed to the spot where his daughter and James had been buried under the dirt. Reaching down, he sifted the dirt between the fingers of his right hand. Then he punched the soil in frustration. Arwood . said he never allowed the children in the construction site. But they . were children who loved to play in a big backyard, and sometimes they . would sneak in and try to help without warning. But when he spotted . them, Arwood said he would immediately kick them out. As . the walls fell in, he recalled, the children were running to get away. He was within inches of grabbing his daughter's hand. But she . disappeared under a surge of dirt. Now he's haunted by the memories. 'I want to wake up. I just want to wake up,' he said. Rocked community: Bradley Jones wipes a tear from his eye as he remembers the two children that his daughter has babysat for the past few months . Recalling the children, his eyes brighten. They were always running around together — the best of friends. Family, he says, is the most important thing to him. He has a broken femur from a car accident, and has spent a lot of time at home in the last two years raising Chloe, James and their siblings. He taught his daughter and James how to ride four-wheelers in the backyard. He taught Chloe how to hunt. 'This was one side of Chloe: hunting with daddy. She begged me every day afterschool and put on coffee at 4 a.m. to hunt before school. She loved her cammo (camouflage) and providing food for her family, be it gardening farming or hunting,' he said, adding that she could hit milk jugs at 200 yards. 'I taught her to do so much because I couldn't do it without her after my accident that broke my femur and destroyed my body and left me helpless.' Arwood was like a father to James. Questions: A man, left, walks with investigators on Monday around the construction site which investigators say they still don't know or understand why was underway . Painful news: Lincoln County, N.C., Sheriff D.M. Carpenter talks with the media on Monday after the children's bodies were found . 'How many times did I have to tell him to brush his teeth? I'll never be able to tell him again, 'Go brush your teeth, brush your hair.' That was the first thing he did in the morning,' he said. On Tuesday, friends and family in this tight-knit rural community came by to offer their condolences. They brought food to the family. Before Sunday's accident, the house was usually filled with laughter. Now it was somber. Ken Caldwell sat on a couch, surrounded by photos of his grandchildren. Nearby was a white karate suit. James is going to be buried in it. He was just a few days shy of taking a test for his orange belt. Caldwell, who worked 34 years in a steel fabrication plant, recalled reading Tom Swift books every night to James, a bright, energetic first-grader with a big smile. He loved his grandmother, who would tuck him in every night. 'After she tucked him in, he would stick out his leg out of the covers and say, 'Grandma, my foot's not covered.'' Chloe was always running around the house and jumping in his lap. 'She's so beautiful,' he said. When he saw the children's bodies in the ambulance, he said he placed his hands on them and asked God to 'bring them back.' While his prayers went unanswered, his faith is still strong — and he's going to use it to carry him through the tough times. 'You have to trust the Lord,' he said. 'I'm just grateful I had time to spend with my grandkids.'","Jordan Arwood's daughter, 6, and nephew, 7, were buried alive when a pit he was digging caved in on them ."
"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 07:20 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 08:35 EST, 10 April 2013 . A statue of Margaret Thatcher could be erected in Trafalgar Square under plans being considered by ministers. Downing Street gave the idea of a permanent memorial to the former Prime Minister its backing as Defence Secretary Philip Hammond revealed the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square ‘could be one of the options’. Boris Johnson also came out in support of the idea, which has been publicly backed by former military personnel who served in the victorious Falklands campaign in 1982. Supporters of Baroness Thatcher are calling for a permanent statue to be erected on the fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square . London Mayor Boris Johnson (left) and Defence Secretary Philip Hammond have given their backing to the idea of a permanent memorial in central London . There is a growing clamour for a statue to be placed in central London on public view, to mark Baroness Thatcher’s immense impact on Britain. In particular there are calls to use the vacant plinth in the shadow of Nelson's column in Trafalgar Square, at the opposite end of Whitehall from the Houses of Parliament. However, there are concerns that any memorial could become the target of vandals and protests, after police clashed with revellers at hate-filled street parties ‘celebrating’ Baroness Thatcher’s death on Monday at the age of 87. There is already a statue of the former Tory leader in the member’s lobby outside the main doors to the chamber of the House of Commons. A bronze statue of the former British Prime Minister stands in the Member's Lobby at the entrance to the chamber of the House of Commons . When the 7ft 6in statue was unveiled in 2007, Baroness Thatcher was the first living former Prime Minister to be honoured in such a way by the Commons . However, in 2002 a marble statue of the three-times election winner was decapitated after it went on show at London’’s Guidhall. Theatre producer Paul Kelleher was jailed for three months after attacking the £150,000 work of art. The court heard that when police arrived minutes after the vandalism, Kelleher said: ‘I think it looks better like that.’ Today ministers appeared to back the idea of a statue which could act as a long-lasting tribute to Baroness Thatcher. Mr Hammond said: ‘I think it would be very appropriate to have a memorial to Margaret Thatcher somewhere in London. ‘I haven’t personally given any thought yet to where that should be, but certainly the fourth plinth could be one of the options. Let’s look at that in slower time, I think these things are better thought about in slightly slower time after the event.’ Write caption here . David Cameron’s official spokesman said the Prime Minister thought it was a ‘good idea to think of ways of how in due course Lady Thatcher can be best commemorated’. The London Mayor’s office also revealed Mr Johnson’s office is now exploring options of a site for a statue. A spokesman for the GLA said: ‘The Mayor believes Baroness Thatcher deserves a prominent statue in a central London location and his team will assist with exploring suitable options.’ Lord Tebbit said that using the plinth in Trafalgar Square would enable Nelson to 'keep an eye on' Baroness Thatcher . The fourth plinth in Trafalgar Square has remained unfilled, but since 1998 has been used to showcase a rotating collection of artworks. Since Baroness Thatcher’s death from a stroke was announced on Monday, the plinth has become the focus of calls for a permanent statue. John Muxworthy, a Lt Commander on the SS Canberra during the Falklands War, said: ‘Let's have a full scale statue next to Nelson to recognise that she was at the heart of the nation. She was a great Briton, let's put her at the centre. Former Tory party chairman Lord Tebbit added: 'I think it would be appropriate for her to be honoured publicly in the centre of London. She could be in Trafalgar, where Nelson could keep an eye on her.' Tory MP Conor Burns, who visited Baroness Thatcher weekly, said the statue in the Commons already served to highlight her political impact. ‘I always say to young people when we go around Parliament, there are only two Prime Ministers of the twentieth century who are not wartime leaders who have statues in Members’ Lobby, they are Clement Attlee and Margaret Thatcher - arguably the only two Prime Ministers of the twentieth century to use their office to fundamentally try and change the country they governed, and I think that might inspire some young people.’","Boris Johnson and Philip Hammond lead calls for central London statue .

Costa Cruises has accepted a one million-euro ($1.31million) fine to settle potential criminal charges for the sinking of the Costa Concordia last year. The firm had been under investigation as the employer of the crew of the Concordia when it hit a rock off Tuscany in January last year, killing 32 people. The prosecution is satisfied with the ruling by the preliminary court judge, Valeria Montesarchio, and will not appeal, prosecution sources said, adding that the fine was close to the maximum allowed by law. Costa Cruises will pay a one million euro fine to settle potential criminal charges over the sinking of the Costa Concordia in 2012 in which 32 lives were lost . The settlement means Costa will not face a criminal trial and ends its potential liability with the state of Italy, but not private lawsuits brought by passengers or crew, the prosecution sources said. 'This is a balanced decision,' Costa Cruises lawyer Marco De Luca said after the ruling. 'It is the most reasonable solution.' The company spokesman confirmed De Luca's comments, originally made to Italian media, and said the company had no further statement. A criminal trial is expected to proceed for the individuals targeted by prosecutors. Costa Cruises, who owns the Costa Concordia, will escape criminal liability after a one million euro settlement was made . Captain Francesco Schettino remains accused of manslaughter, causing a shipwreck and abandoning the ship, which was carrying more than 4,000 passengers and crew, and could face up to 20 years in jail. Schettino steered the ship close to shore in a manoeuvre known as a 'salute', striking a rock that tore a gash in its hull. The 950ft long Concordia came to rest on its side, half submerged, where it now rests awaiting salvage. Five other members of the crew including Schetttino's first officer, and three members of a crisis unit set up by Costa to handle the accident, also face indictment and trial. Costa Cruises will, as previously announced, seek damages for the loss of the vessel as a civil party in the criminal case when it begins, De Luca said.","Prosecution sources said one million euros was close to maximum fine in law .

A terrifying knifepoint robbery which was captured on CCTV appeared to show an innocent bystander look on in horror as a thief stole a till from a corner shop. But in fact the witness - who even offered moral support to the victims - was an accomplice helping his flatmate execute the robbery as part of a botched sting operation. Francis Hobin, who can be seen on the video ducking for cover, had posed as a shopper in the grocery store in Manchester to trick the shopkeeper into opening the till. Scroll down to watch the CCTV . Witness: Francis Hobin, left, claimed to be a bystander to a robbery carried out by Shane Doyle, centre . Partners in crime: Hobin, left, and Doyle, right, plotted the raid together while living at Hobin's nearby flat . At that moment, Shane Doyle burst in waving a large kitchen knife and demanded the takings before grabbing the till itself and fleeing. Hobin, 38, pretended to cower in fear at the back of the shop, and after the raid he gave the victim his details and offered to give a witness statement as a 'gesture of support'. But when police studied CCTV of the incident, they recognised Doyle and discovered that he and Hobin lived together at a flat a few streets away. The pair were yesterday jailed after Hobin pleaded guilty to robbery and Doyle, 32, was convicted by a jury after a four-day trial. Fighting back: When the shopkeeper attempted to intervene, Doyle waved the knife at him and punched him . Terror: The 60-something shop assistant screamed for help as Hobin watched on at the back of the store . Back for more: Doyle then apparently decided he would remove the till at take its entire contents away . Manchester Crown Court heard that the robbery in the Newton Heath area took place in September last year. Hobin went into the shop, picked up a pint of milk and a bag of sugar and went to pay for his groceries. As . the shop assistant, a 60-something woman, took the money and closed the . till, Doyle ran in wearing sunglasses and a hat in an attempt at a . disguise. He demanded money from the till, then grabbed it and tried to pull off the counter. Disguise: The robber was wearing sunglasses and a large hat in an effort to hide his identity . Robbery: Shane Doyle burst in waving a kitchen knife and demanding the contents of the shop's till . Struggle: He can be seen wrenching the till, which was later found abandoned in a nearby street . The shop owner came to help his colleague, but Doyle lunged towards him with his knife and punched him in the face. The thief wrenched the till from the counter and ran out with it in his arms. Throughout the robbery, Hobin remained in the shop watching from six feet away, and told staff to call him if they needed a witness to talk to police. When the smashed-up till was recovered in the nearby area it was found to have Doyle's fingerprints on it, while a forensic expert told the court that he was the person seen on the CCTV footage. Success: But Doyle's fingerprints were all over the till and he was soon picked up by police . Aftermath: Hobin offered to give a witness statement even though he was actually an accomplice . Further investigation revealed that Doyle, who committed a string of robberies in his native Ireland, was living at Hobin's home address, and the pair were arrested four days after the crime was committed. The thief was sentenced to six years in prison, while his accomplice was given a sentence of three years. A spokesman for Greater Manchester Police said: 'This was a calculated robbery against the owners of this shop, who were subjected to a violent attack at the hands of Doyle, just so he could get his hands on cash from the till to buy drugs. 'Doyle and Hobin have today been sentenced for their actions and I hope that the victims involved in this traumatic incident can take some solace in seeing these men put behind bars.'","Francis Hobin, 38, was witness to robbery in Manchester corner shop .

Tragic: Schoolgirl Jessica Jevons, 12, was found hanged by her twin brother Patrick in her family home in Walkden, Greater Manchester . A 12-year-old schoolgirl was found hanged after being sent to bed early following a row with her twin brother about sharing the family computer, an inquest heard. Jessica Jevons staged a . 'demonstration of annoyance' on the landing in her home in the . expectation of being found quickly and 'shocking' relatives into a . response. But it was 15 minutes before her twin brother Patrick found her as he went upstairs to bed in Walkden, Greater Manchester. The schoolgirl died despite her mother Michelle's attempts to revive her. Jessica, who also had two other brothers, was described as a 'happy and . outgoing' schoolgirl who had been arguing with Patrick about using the family PC just before she died. The youngster, who was a Year Eight pupil at St . George's Roman Catholic High School, was told to go bed but stormed upstairs and hanged herself on February 5. Her mother said in a statement read to the inquest in Bolton: 'This has come totally out of the blue, she was a happy, outgoing girl, she had been happy all that week and she was looking forward to going to Spain for the summer holidays. 'She had a boyfriend and they had a good relationship. She did not have any issues and was happy at school she had lots of friends. She had been bullied at school years before but had got over that and had blossomed and had not been bullied since. 'She had never attempted to take her life before. We can't understand, we think it was an accident which went wrong. We can't believe it was intentional, there are no issues over the circumstances of her death.' She added: 'Jessica had an argument with her brother, they had argued about the use of our computer. Jessica was told to go to bed, it would have been around 9 pm. 'At around 9.15 pm Patrick also went upstairs to bed and he discovered Jessica. 'He raised the alarm and got her down and I commenced CPR and an ambulance was called - but sadly Jessica had died.' Detective Inspector Kevin Johnston said that efforts were being made to revive the schoolgirl when he arrived. He . said: 'The conclusion I reached is that she positioned herself so that . whoever was next upstairs behind her would have seen her and would be . shocked into responding. 'With . exactly how she intended to present herself the intention was to shock . her brother or whoever was going up the stairs following the minor . incident with her brother.' Tributes: Jessica Jevons was described as' an extremely popular girl' with a 'lively outgoing character' by her headteacher . Death: Jessica was found hanged in the family home in Walkden, Greater Manchester. Despite her mother's efforts to revive her she was pronounced dead at the scene . Recording a verdict of accidental death Bolton coroner Jennifer Leeming said: 'I could not possibly say that this young lady intended to take her own life. 'The situation is that Jessica has gone upstairs after a minor row, she has been absent from the family for a very short time, nothing has been heard. 'She has placed herself in a situation . - where allowing for the fact that there were more private locations, . she must have known she could be easily found indicating to me that was . her intention. 'She was . displaying herself, she had put herself on display to demonstrate upset . or an annoyance in the hope that she would be found. It seems to me that . Jessica probably intended a demonstration that has tragically gone . wrong.' Jessica's parents Michelle and Duncan were not at the inquest and were excused attending. Inquest: The coroner was told Jessica was found hanged after being sent to bed early following a row about use of the family computer . They were said to 'deeply devastated and shocked' and in a statement expressed 'how much Jessica touched the hearts of many, especially Patrick.' Philip Harte, the headteacher at Jessica's school, said: 'She was an extremely popular girl, especially amongst the staff, and she will be fondly remembered for her lively outgoing character. 'This sad news has come as a great shock to us all and I am proud of the dignity and respect shown by our staff and children as we have supported each other.' Claire Fewings, the parent of one of Jessica's friends, said: 'Jess showed kindness, love and compassion for her friends and family like no other child I've known. 'I would see Jess most mornings on my way to work, she would have a spring in her step, sparkling eyes and run over to me. My memories of Jess will forever be of a very special, happy, smiling beautiful girl and a dear friend to my son.' Father John Flynn, from the Salford Diocese, said: 'It is very sad and we hope and pray for the family at this time and offer our sympathy.'","Jessica Jevons discovered by her twin brother when he went upstairs .

A five-week-old red fox is resting its weary head on a very bright bandage as it recovers from a broken leg. The little cub was found abandoned and injured outside a shop in Leatherhead town centre in Surrey earlier today. With no mother fox in sight, the struggling cub was discovered by a kind passer-by who called a nearby wildlife aid centre. Fox-trotting fail: The little cub is resting its weary head on the bright neon bandage as it recovers from the ordeal . The little cub, weighing just 1.5lbs, was taken to the Wildlife Aid Foundation in Leatherhead, where its injuries were tended to.

Temperatures may be yet to hit double figures this April but YouTube blogger Emily Hartridge has  already left winter behind. She optimistically dedicates this week's Ten Reasons Why to the new season with her latest post, Why We Love Spring. A tough topic to sell in given the freezing temperatures outside, she enlists the help of handsome Welsh ITV The Hub presenter Matt Johnson, 30, to play her pretend boyfriend. In the new offering Emily, from London, outlines such springtime benefits as women starting to wear less clothes ('You will enjoy this is you are a man or lesbian'), and the fact that we can eat copious amounts of chocolate at Easter. Scroll down for video . Emily, from London, boasts springtime benefits such as eating copious amounts of chocolate at Easter . Hunky Welsh ITV The Hub presenter Matt Johnson, 30, plays Emily's pretend boyfriend in the video . But despite her enthusiasm, the first reason she gives in support of spring is shrouded in sarcasm: 'Winter is over, spring is here, the air is getting warmer... (is it f***),' she says. 'For those of you watching that live in the UK you now that we haven't seen spring yet.' Emily and Matt's role play involves the couple, kitted out in bikinis, beach shorts and sunglasses, leaving the house to go to the beach. However upon being hit by the reality of the temperatures Matt seizes up in shock and Emily demands: 'It's freezing, can we go inside?' Reason two is the fact that women start wearing less clothes - one to be enjoyed 'if you are a man or lesbian'. Other reasons include the fact that feet are liberated: you can 'finally get out those sandals out and let your feet breathe'. This point is illustrated by Matt appearing in the sitting room ready for an outing wearing bright white socks and flip flops together.

Reason two, the fact that women start wearing less clothes, is one to be enjoyed 'If you are a man or lesbian' Matt, whose feet are free, wears white socks and flip flops together, but think his jeans aren't quite right . Emily gives him a horrified, confused look, and Matt responds: 'It's the jeans isn't it?'. Next, and this is arguably the most convincing of all, is the fact that those of us who celebrate Easter spend the entire time 'ramming as much chocolate down our throats as possible'. To illustrate the point, Matt and Emily gorge on chocolate eggs in front of the television, hiding away and even in bed.

A woman who suffered a series of harrowing sexual assaults at the hands of her trusted faith healer has spoken of the moment she finally, fearing he would rape her, reported his crimes to the police - and why it took her so long to admit to herself what was happening. Joanne Mulholland, 41, first met self-employed alternative therapist Michael Ireland, 60, from Stockport, through the spiritual church she attended to give her respite and hope from crippling lifelong scoliosis, a debilitating and degenerative curvature of the spine that had lead to arthritis. A well-known and well-liked figure within the spiritual community, Ireland suggested to Joanne that he could cure the agonising physical complaints which several medical operations had failed to rectify with his 'healing hands'. Desperate for anyone who could help her, Joanne agreed to pay him a visit. Scroll down for video . Joanne Mulholland telling her horrific story of sexual abuse on This Morning . But even after the first session in his incongruously seedy high-rise flat, Joanne felt uncomfortable with Ireland's behaviour, on one hand completely professional, on the other inappropriately intimate. 'He was a jovial character, I'm a jovial character, so we hit it off immediately,' Joanne explained to Philip Schofield and Holly Willoughby on This Morning today. 'I felt I had nothing to lose.' She continued: 'The first time he had me on the bed and scanned his hands above my body he told me exactly what was wrong and warned I'd end up in a wheelchair. I was so impressed he picked that up - that's what I'd been told by surgeons. Michael Ireland, a self-employed Reiki master, who was imprisoned for sexual offences . 'But then, since I also practice Reiki, he asked me to pass my hands over him. When I got to the area above his groin he said, ""There, you've felt it, haven't you? I'm impotent. Doctors can't do anything about it."" 'I was so embarrassed and it seemed inappropriate, but I like to always think the best of people and not judge them so the caring side of me did nothing. 'He said to me then: ""You're not going to come back again, are you? That's what they all do."" I should have run for the hills but I was desperate.' Things quickly became more intense. Though Joanne was fully clothed in the paid-for sessions, Ireland found ways of moving his hands under her top or down her trousers, using excuses to grope her such as 'your pressure point is so deep here, I just need to put my hand under your shirt to reach it', and 'you're full of so many demons, let me just unblock them by unzipping your jeans'. After Ireland had begun touching Joanne beneath her underwear, he changed. Joanne said: 'His voice changed, he started breathing heavily, he was rougher and I was scared. I had to get out but I didn't tell -I felt ashamed that I'd put myself in such a vulnerable situation when I should have run.' Eventually, Joanne came forward to the police, and then the floodgates opened. Other women came forward, including two who had been 15 at the time of Ireland's attack, and one who had been only seven. Ireland was jailed at the beginning of March, admitting five counts of sexual assault against Joanne. The fraudster admitted a total of 25 offences against eight women over a 25-year period, including indecent assault and sexual activity with a child. The court also heard Ireland, who was . sentenced to 16 years imprisonment, already had a conviction for . indecently assaulting a girl under 14 when he was a teenager. Joanne said: 'He'd manipulated so many people, and who knows how many more that were too scared to come forward. But when saw him in court, sitting there with his head in his hands, I just felt pity for him.' Joanne, now qualified as a holistic therapist herself, is writing a book to deal with what has happened.","Joanne Mulholland, 41, met Michael Holland, 60, through spiritual church .

David Hughes, who was accused of child sex offences, was found dead at his home after being subjected to an online hate campaign . A coach driver facing child sex allegations is feared to have killed himself after being subjected to a vigilante hate campaign on Facebook. David Hughes, 44, was accused of grooming girls from a majorettes troupe he ferried to cheerleading competitions. Friends said the father-of-two was 'devastated' by the accusations, which he denied. But Mr Hughes, from  Clayton-Le-Moors, near Accrington, Lancashire, was subjected to angry messages on Facebook and was branded a 'paedo'. In another message his photograph, name and home address was posted online. Police were called to the coach driver's home on Thursday amid concerns he had taken an overdose when he did not turn up for work. Officers are believed to have recovered medication and a note. Terry O'Neill, Mr Hughes' boss at Abbey Coaches, said today: 'The old phrase ""innocent until proven guilty"" just seems to have thrown out of the window and banished for ever in this country. 'I believe Dave was innocent and as far as I and others were concerned there were no doubts about him. 'Yet some people just assume once someone's is merely accused they are automatically guilty as charged. 'It's terrible that in this day and age people have lived under the threat of the mob even if they are merely accused of wrongdoing.' He appeared at Blackburn Magistrates' Court last September where he indicated not guilty pleas to three . charges of meeting a girl following sexual grooming and three charges of . abusing a position of trust. Mr Hughes last appeared before Preston Crown Court . for a directions hearing on the allegations on March 26, and a trial . date had been fixed for June 12. Mr Hughes was due to stand trial at Preston Crown Court, pictured, in June on six child sex charges . He had been volunteering as a coach driver for a local majorette troupe when the allegations were made. Mr . Hughes, who is believed to have grown-up daughter and a young son from . separate relationships, started working for the coach company two years . ago. The Newcastle United fan, who was . originally from Durham, had not been suspended from his job but his work . was restricted by bail conditions imposed by the courts. Friends said the coach driver was a 'great bloke' who was 'really upset' by the online abuse . Following his court appearances, Mr Hughes was targeted on Facebook by a man not related to the alleged victims. The messages were later removed on the advice of Lancashire Police. Mr . O'Neill, who called the police on Thursday, said: 'I had every faith . Dave would be found not guilty of all charges and would have been . vindicated. 'But the abuse he was getting on Facebook in recent weeks really upset him. 'One . particular man started posting his name, calling him a paedophile. It . escalated and he then posted a photo of Dave along with his name and . address calling him a paedo. 'It . really upset him. He was devastated. I actually saw the message on . Facebook and showed him. I couldn't believe what people were doing.' An inquest has been opened and adjourned . into Mr Hughes' death. Mr O'Neill said his friend was a 'great bloke'. He . said: 'He used to do a lot of the school contracts but had to stop that . after he was charged. He did the jobs taking old folks out then. I . never thought about suspending him, that's how sure I was about him.' Lancashire . Police said in a statement: 'Police attended an address on Whalley Road . in Clayton le Moors after a call was made regarding a concern for the . safety of the occupant of the address.

The land in South Dakota is on the market for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million). One of the country's poorest Native American tribes wants to buy the historically significant piece of land where their ancestors were killed, but tribal leaders say the price tag for a property appraised at less than $7,000 is just too much. Land owner James Czywczynski is trying to sell a 40-acre fraction of the Wounded Knee National Historic Landmark on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation to the Oglala Sioux Tribe.

Czywczynski, whose family has owned . the property since 1968, recently gave the tribe an ultimatum: purchase . the land for $3.9 million or he will open up bidding to non-Native . Americans. He said he has been trying to sell the land to the tribe for years. Scene: This is the site where a battle was fought between the US Army and Sioux Indians.

'I think it's ridiculous that he's . putting a price on it like that,' said Kevin Yellow Bird Steele, a . tribal council representative from the Wounded Knee district, who thinks . Czywczynski is putting pressure on the tribe because of the impending . money. 'We need to come down to earth and be realistic. We're not rich. We're not a rich tribe.' Czywczynski insists the site's historical significance adds value. 'You can’t put a price on the lives . that were taken there,' said Garfield Steele, a tribal council . representative for the Wounded Knee district, reported the New York Times. The last major . bloodshed of the American Indian wars occurred on . December 29 when the U.S. troops went into the camp to disarm the men.

Czywczynski, who also is trying to sell another 40-acre piece of nearby land to the tribe for $1 million, also noted a coalition of Sioux tribes raised $9 million in December to buy land about 100 miles away in the Black Hills — although the Oglala Sioux Tribe did not contribute to that effort. 'I'm getting older now and my family and myself want to dispose of this property,' said Czywczynski, 75, who now lives in Rapid City. 'We just want to see it in the hands of the Indian people rather than put it on the open market to the public.' Craig Dillon, a tribal council member on the Land Committee, said he would like to see the tribe buy the land at Wounded Knee because then they could build a museum commemorating the massacre with artifacts, food vendors and a place for local artists to sell their art to visitors. 'But with the price the way it is, I don't think the tribe could ever buy it,' Dillon said.","The 40-acre property is being offered for $3.9 million (about £2.5 million)

Battlefront was pulled up - or withdrawn from competition - during the fourth race by jockey Katie Walsh and later collapsed and died. The timing was particularly unfortunate for Ms Walsh, who rides one of the favourites for the Grand National on Saturday, after she defended the sport earlier this week, saying in a magazine interview that the horses were treated better than 'many children'. Scroll down for video . Off to a terrible start: Battlefront, ridden (left) by Katy Walsh, a female rider who is one of the favourites to win the National on Saturday on Seabass, suffered a suspected heart attack after being pulled up . Tragic sight: Katy Walsh had jumped ten fences in the John Smith's Fox Hunter's Steeple Chase before deciding to end Battlefront's run . Battlefront had cleared 10 fences in . the John Smith's Fox Hunters' Steeple Chase, the first competitive test . of significant course changes and new fence frames designed to improve . safety. The cause of his death has not been . confirmed but it is thought Battlefront may have suffered a heart . attack. A further five horses fell in the race, although none was . significantly injured. Andrew Tyler, director of Animal Aid, . said: 'The Aintree authorities and the British Horse Racing Authority . have been claiming that major new safety measures and efficiencies would . eliminate much of the risk associated with racing on the Grand National . course. 'But today's Fox Hunters' Chase, in . which Battlefront lost his life, was stomach-wrenchingly chaotic from . start to finish Several horses fell or were pulled up, tired and . potentially injured.

When he realised that the pensioner . was finding it difficult to breathe he ended the conversation, having . failed to make a sale. But he was so concerned about her . condition that he dialled the number again, asked for her address and . then called for an ambulance. Paramedics found Mrs Robbins slumped . on the floor and paralysed after suffering a stroke in the living room . of her home in Walsall, West Midlands.

Home: Paramedics rushed to Jessica Robbins' house in Walsall, pictured, after Mr Shepherd called 999 . Random: If Mr Shepherd had not decided to tackle his call list from the bottom rather than the top, Mrs Robbins might not be alive today . The telesales worker, 25, said: ‘I didn’t make a sale but I’m so glad I could help her. ‘I felt uneasy after ending the call so we decided to call her back and I’m glad we did. ‘Cold callers get a hard time from people, but if I hadn’t called she’d probably have died.’ Mr Shepherd visited Mrs Robbins last week to meet her in person and deliver a bouquet of flowers. He added: ‘She’s made a good recovery. She’s had a number of mild heart attacks in the past  but is still . doing well. She’s a tough old bird.’ The 84-year-old was phoned on March . 12 by Mr Shepherd. By chance he had decided to start at the bottom of the long list of home owners in front of him instead of at the top as usual. Halfway through his solar panels pitch, however, he realised the pensioner was breathing heavily, so he ended the phone call. Employer: Mr Shepherd was in only his second day of working as a salesman for a solar panels company . He spoke to a supervisor before calling Mrs Robbins back. She answered and gave Mr  Shepherd her address so he could ring 999. When paramedics arrived minutes later, they were let in by neighbours and discovered her collapsed in the living room. Mrs Robbins, a retired dance teacher . who has three children, five grandchildren and five great grandchildren, . said: ‘I am very grateful to the young man. ‘I’ve got the feeling back and I’ve . got the young lad to thank for that. He was very good with me on the . phone. He went above and beyond for me. ‘I don’t usually listen to telesales but I’m glad I answered the phone to Simon. ‘Salesmen sometimes get a bad name, . but in this case he saved my life.’ Mr Shepherd works for Zenith . Renewable Energy Ltd. His boss, Craig Siviter, said: ‘For some reason . Simon started from the bottom of the list instead of the top. ‘It was his first call of the day, on . only his second day of the job, [and] he spoke to me as he believed the . lady was unwell. I told him to call back and then we called for an . ambulance. ‘We get people slamming down the phone . on us, all sorts, but  it was pleasing on this occasion that we could . step in and help  the lady.

TIME to call 999. If a person fails any one of these tests, get help immediately by dialling 999.

'Violated lady's privacy and dignity': Syrian immigrant Ali Rashid (pictured) has been banned from every swimming pool and spa facility in the UK after sexually assaulting a woman in a hotel steam room . A sex pest was banned from every swimming pool and spa facility in Britain today after 'violating' a woman in a steam room. Syrian national Ali Rashid, 44, kissed his victim 'from her ear down to her collar bone area' as she tried to relax at a four-star hotel. When she backed off, he squashed her into the corner of the room, put his hand on her thigh and stroked her face. The terrified woman reported the incident to hotel staff, saying she felt 'trapped and disturbed'. When quizzed by police, Rashid attempted to turn the attack around and claimed: 'I no kiss her, she kiss me'. But he later admitted one count of sexual assault when he appeared in court. Rashid was spared jail, but a judge said he can not visit any spa, gym or swimming pool area where women are present for five years. A court heard he and the woman were staying at the four-star Mercure Holland House hotel in Cardiff in January last year when he followed her into the steam room. Prosecutor Jonathan Reece told Cardiff Crown Court: 'Rashid attempted to make conversation with her, asking her name before going to shake her hand. ‘As she put her hand out he grabbed hold of it and pulled her forward with enough force to pull her up onto her feet. ‘He put his arms around her, as if hugging her, he then began kissing the right side of her neck from her ear down to her shoulder/collar bone area. ‘This happened very quickly and clearly his victim was not expecting it and it took her by surprise.’ As the women backed off she fell back on to the bench. Rashid then squeezed in next to her squashing her into the corner of the steam room, Mr Reece said. Mr Reece added: ‘He then put his hand on the top part of her thigh, onto her bare skin. ‘She pulled her legs up to her chest and wrapped her arms around them. He was telling her she looked beautiful, young looking and slim and stroking her face and hair. ‘This happened for some minutes and the woman was really disturbed by it, she felt she was trapped.’ Finally realising his attention was unwelcome, Rashid then pulled away from the woman telling her: ‘Don’t be angry, I touch and kiss you because I feel comfortable with you.’ Pest: The 44-year-old was given an eight-month jail term suspended for a year, told to sign the sex offenders' register and ordered to pay the victim £400 compensation . Following the assault the woman reported the incident to hotel staff who in turn informed police. When officers interviewed Rashid he denied any wrongdoing. He said: ‘I no kiss her, she kiss me.’ He told officers his victim had . initiated the kiss after he greeted her, although he did admit to . finding the woman attractive and asking her whether she had a boyfriend. Defending Rashid, Stephen Thomas appealed to the judge for a lenient sentence. Mr Thomas said: ‘All sexual assaults are serious however this sexual assault falls at the bottom of the rung. ‘It’s definitely in the lower . category, there’s no touching of genitalia, no force used and no threats . used. There was minimal contact with his hands while it was over . relatively quickly. ‘The offence was committed over a year ago and there haven’t been any problems since. ‘This is clearly a man with . difficulties, he’s got very serious physical problems, serious back . problems, serious leg problems and it’s very difficult for him.’ Sleazy: A prosecutor told Cardiff Crown Court (above) that Rashid 'began kissing the right side of her neck from her ear down to her shoulder/collar bone area' But Judge Parry said: ‘This was a . serious offence of its kind.

Guilty: Paul Mosley helped plot the fire which killed six of Mick Philpott's children . He is Mick Philpott’s best friend and sidekick, with whom he shared women, drugs, and plotted the fire which killed six helpless children. But Paul Mosley has a violent criminal history in his own right and has a violent past of his own. Mosley - or Shakey, as he is known to friends –  was yesterday found guilty of six counts of manslaughter after Nottingham Crown Court heard he helped Philpott set the fatal house fire before fleeing the scene when police were called. He was convicted after jurors heard officers found incriminating traces of petrol on his clothes from the night of the fire, which he had spent at the Philpott’s home. No petrol container was ever found because it is believed to have been handed from Philpott to Mosley through a front window before the fire was set. Hours earlier he had a sordid threesome with the married couple and was, days later, taped receiving a sex act from Mrs Philpott in an attempt to keep him ‘onside’. Mosley first faced a court in 1982 after, aged 15, he locked an old lady he had befriended in her cellar in order to steal £82 from her purse. He was ordered to be detained for three years after he confessed that he had targeted 74-year-old widow Annabel Greenwood, one of the customers on his newspaper round. He picked her up and manhandled her into the basement before ransacking her purse. He fled Derby by train but was arrested the next day in West Yorkshire after Mrs Greenwood managed to attract the attention of a delivery driver. She died a year and a day after the robbery, from heart failure. Marie Cope, Mrs Greenwood’s only child, said Mosley regularly ran errands for her mother, who suffered with arthritis. Mrs Cope, 72, from Newmarket, Suffolk, said: ‘She was used to letting him in and used to give him money so he knew where her purse was. She was shocked when he turned on her and robbed her because she had trusted him. ‘He just lifted her up and put her in the cellar.’ Scroll down for video . Convicted: Paul Mosley, right, sits in the dock with Mick and Mairead Philpott yesterday as the jury return their guilty verdicts . In the following years, Mosley gained the nickname ‘Shakey’ – after he became scared during a fight and cowered indoors, shaking uncontrollably. He was seen crying at the children’s funeral and attended the Philpotts’ first court hearing after they were charged with killing their children. After he was first arrested in June, he bragged of being on bail for the deaths of the children. He was rearrested in November, after petrol was discovered on his clothes and a relative reported him talking of ‘rehearsing’ the blaze six weeks before it happened. Mosley, who was friends with the Philpotts for 15 years and saw them almost every day, turned on Mick as he faced trial for killing the children.

Arriving home to find a stranger's car parked outside is a persistent problem which has driven John Anderson up the wall. So, to prove his point, the angry homeowner has painted yellow lines all over the one at the front of his cottage. While it is yet to be seen whether the extraordinary tactic will help to deter other drivers from leaving their cars outside, the new paintwork has certainly raised eyebrows in his neighbourhood. Not on my doorstep: So fed up with cars parked outside his front door, John Anderson painted double yellow lines on his £165,000 cottage last week . Mr Anderson, 48, an engineer from . Coundon, Coventry, now says he will not paint over the lines until the . council agrees to put a resident's permit bay outside for him to use. 'I'm at work all day and then turn up . at midnight and I'm having to drive half way round the village to find . somewhere to park,' he added. 'I had to park a quarter of a mile away from my house the other day. 'The lines will stay put until we can . get it resolved. Then I can have my nice white cottage back again.' Mr . Anderson, who has lived in the £160,000 two-bedroom home for 25 years, . claims the problem started in 2011 when the council narrowed one end of . the street, making it impossible to park on both sides. Disagrees with paint job: Mr Anderson decided to take matters into his own hands after the council repainted the parking double yellow lines but stopped short of his front door . Yellow lines were then painted on the . road but the section in front of his home was left out - meaning it is . now one of the few spots in the immediate area on which motorists can . legally park. Three weeks ago the lines were repainted, making the problem worse, he says. As well as complaining to the . council, Mr Anderson last week decided to take more drastic action - . painting an arc of yellow lines across the front of his cottage, as well . as a bright yellow exclamation mark by the front door. He said: 'Parking hasn't been a . problem until a few years ago and it's got worse. It's a hassle and time . consuming and not ideal when it's dark. We deserve our own place to . park. 'We've been to ward meetings and it's . been suggested we park on the other side of the village. We don't just . need parking restrictions, we need residents' parking permits. Parking permit: Mr Anderson says he will get rid of the yellow lines when the council gives residents parking permits now that it is so difficult to find a park . 'The lines will stay put until we can . hold talks with the council about having these permits and maybe we can . get it resolved.' Neighbour Thelma Anderson, 66, has also complained of . strangers parking outside her home on Butcher's Lane. She added: 'There are times I'm coming home and I'm worried about whether I can get a space on my street. 'I've been able to park outside my . home or further up the street before and it's been fine but now I have . to try and find somewhere else. It's quite frightening at night. 'Not everyone can have parking . outside their home but the reason we moved here is because we knew we . could park on this street. It's not always the case anymore.' Coventry City Council said yellow . lines were needed because when they were not there in the past emergency . services were restricted by congestion on the road. A spokeswoman added: 'We are well aware of the difficulties parking in Butcher's Lane, which is a narrow road. 'If residents want to apply for a permit scheme for the road it would be considered.'","John Anderson took the drastic action because the council had repainted lines but stopped short of his front door .

The Shadow Chancellor and leadership hopeful opted to attend a speed awareness course on Tuesday rather than take penalty points on his licence. Mr Balls said he was ‘bang to rights’ when caught going 56mph in a 50mph zone on a motorway in his West Yorkshire constituency. Traffic trouble: Shadow chancellor Ed Balls admitted he had been caught speeding in his own constituency, and went on a speeding course to avoid penalty points . He blamed roadworks for his misdemeanour, as temporary speed restrictions were in force. Mr Balls has form when it comes to . motoring offences – in April 2010, he was caught on his mobile phone . while driving between his constituency and London. At the time, he was fined £60 and was meant to have received three penalty points on his licence. However, yesterday the Shadow . Chancellor said he had decided to take the safety driving course because . ‘I currently have no points on my licence and would like to keep it . that way’. Let the train take the strain: The speeding revelation is embarrassing for Ed Miliband's Labour party, which has sought to exploit George Osborne's parking faux pas for political gain . Writing on his blog, Mr Balls appeared to blame long-running roadworks for his error. He said: ‘Like many local people, I was caught out by the never-ending roadworks on the M62. Pulling on to the motorway at Morley I realised too late that the speed restrictions were still in place. ‘I was caught and bang to rights – doing 56 in a 50 mile restriction zone. Going too far, too fast, you might say. ‘I paid my fine and chose to attend a speed awareness course. I currently have no points on my licence and would like to keep it that way. Which is why, this week, I ended up in the Holiday Inn with 39 others.’ Her claimed the course – which allows drivers to escape penalty points by undergoing training the dangers of speeding was ‘very professional and actually really worthwhile’. The driver of George  Osborne's car reversed into the disabled parking space outside Magor services on the Eastbound side of the M4 . Mr Balls went on: ‘What hit home were the statistics which link speed to car deaths. At 20 mph, less than 10 per cent of people will lose their lives if hit by a car. But the probability rises exponentially, going above 40 per cent at 40mph. ‘Our course instructors explained that casualty rates have fallen over the past decade, as drivers have become more aware and car design has improved. The worrying thing is that this trend has started to reverse in recent years.’ He went on to claim that his own misdemeanor reinforced his call for more 20mph routes in near schools and residential areas in Morley in his constituency.","Shadow chancellor admits driving at 56mph in a 50mph zone on M62 .

Sexual charges against an eccentric millionaire artist accused of paying boys cash, drugs and cars in return for sex before settling with his accusers will be presented to a grand jury in Texas. Evidence against 75-year-old Stanley Marsh 3 is to be presented before a Texas Panhandle grand jury  by Special prosecutor Matt Powell today accusing him in a string of shocking sex assault cases. The millionaire and artist, best known for his 'Cadillac Ranch' art display along an interstate in the Texas Panhandle is accused of molesting a 15-year-old boy and a 16-year-old boy in 2010. Taking the stand: Eccentric 'Cadillac Ranch' millionaire Stanley Marsh 3, seen after settling sexual abuse allegations from 10 teenagers in February, faces a Texas grand jury on Wednesday . Millionaire: The eccentric millionaire artist, pictured right, is best known for his 'Cadillac Ranch' art display along an interstate in the Texas Panhandle . In February, Marsh 3  - who uses the Arabic numeral '3' in his legal name - settled 10 lawsuits from teenagers who alleged he paid them in cash, alcohol, drugs and in one case, two BMWs for sex acts with him during secret encounters at his office. In one of the civil cases, a teen plaintiff claimed he had more than 100 sexual encounters with Marsh in his office and Toad Hall home in Amarillo. Powell will take six counts of sexual assault and five counts of sexual performance by a child before a Potter County panel. Amarillo police have said they found . evidence during their search of Marsh 3's offices that corroborated 'the . accounts of sexual exploitation of minors.' Police seized 70 envelopes . of blue pills, signed confidentiality agreements, two Apple computers, . couch cushion covers and a photo of a nude male, a search warrant . inventory report said. Investigators also found 11 copies of blank or . unsigned 'release and waiver' documents in a drawer in Marsh 3's private . office, according to the police investigation inventory. A witness had told police that Marsh's office had a large bed and a bottle of Viagra, which he would give to the teenager. Supportive wife: Mr Marsh's wife Wendy, second from right, became his guardian after he suffered a stroke . Poor health: The sickly Amarillo millionaire's lawyers denied the sex abuse allegations . Marsh 3 is free on $300,000 bond . after turning himself in after an arrest warrant listing the 11 felony . counts was issued in November. If convicted, Marsh 3 faces up to 20 . years in prison per count and fines of up to $10,000. His attorneys have . denied the allegations. In a statement following his February settlement with the teens, plaintiffs' attorney Anthony Buzbee and Marsh's attorney Kelly Utsinger said the teenagers and Marsh have resolved their differences and that no side will have further comments. Marsh 3 suffered a massive stroke in 2011 and his wife, Gwendolyn Marsh, was later appointed as his guardian. Marsh 3, his wife, his son, Stanley Marsh IV - who uses the more traditional Roman numeral - and associate David Weir settled the 10 civil suits.

Eccentric: In 1997, Stanley Marsh 3, pictured watched as workers lowered into place one of the 10 Cadillacs . Memorable: Mr Marsh put Amarillo on the map with the famous Cadilac Ranch he created in the 1970s . When Marsh 3 was arrested last year, . his lawyers issued a statement saying the charges were 'mere allegations . by the group of accusers who have filed a barrage of civil lawsuits ... seeking millions of dollars.' The statement said that the accusers had . waited to come forward until after Marsh 3 suffered a massive stroke and . was legally incapacitated. In 1998, Marsh 3 pleaded no contest to . misdemeanor charges of unlawful restraint and criminal trespassing as . part of an agreement that dismissed five felony charges that included . kidnapping, aggravated assault with a deadly weapons and indecency with a . child. He served 10 days in jail and paid $4,000 in fines. Marsh 3 is probably best known for . planting 10 brightly painted Cadillacs nose down along Interstate 40 in . the Panhandle in the 1970s. The cars, ranging from a 1948 club coupe to a . 1963 sedan and gathered from junkyards, private collectors and used car . lots, have since become a pop art landmark. Visitors through the years have . splattered them with graffiti and in 2005 they were coated in pink to . honor breast cancer victims, survivors and their families. Mr Marsh also . has painted them black and yellow to honor the passing of longtime . friends. The installation put Amarillo on the . map in the 1970s and the bizarre attraction inspired a Bruce Springsteen . song a decade later which only boosted its popularity. An Amarillo native and . philanthropist, Mr Marsh and his wife have donated to local art and . education causes.

The husband: IT boss Peter Mason is alleged to have stabbed his wife and her lover . A millionaire who killed himself in prison after trying to murder his estranged wife and her lover co-ordinated a sinister plan from behind bars to stop her getting her hands on his money. As his dying wish, computer boss Peter Mason had his bank account emptied and arranged for his two country mansions to be stripped of their luxury furnishings so that his wife, Debbie, would be left with nothing. Mrs Mason, who has two young children and is still undergoing hospital treatment for severe stab injuries, has now spoken to police after she tried to access their shared funds and was distraught to discover everything was gone. A will Mason wrote last May, which handed all of his money to their children Emelia, 11, and Dylan, seven, is also said to have been hidden. Mason, 58, earned £200,000 a year as an account director at Hewlett Packard and previously worked for Royal Mail and the NHS. He was found dead in his cell on January 19 as he awaited trial for the attempted murder of his 45-year-old wife and Michael Longden, a childhood sweetheart she had got back in touch with via Friends Reunited. He was accused of stabbing them in a frenzied attack last July after she fled the £500,000 family home in Tuxford, Nottinghamshire, with the children to start a new life with her lover. While on remand in prison following the attack, Mason is said to have orchestrated a ‘pyrrhic victory’ over his wife, confiding in a fellow prisoner that he wanted to make sure she could not access the wealth he had earned as a successful IT boss. Mason slipped two notes under his new friend’s cell door, one containing his online banking details and another authorising the man to enter his two homes and ‘remove any of my personal items on my behalf’ as soon as he had served his sentence. These valuables are said to have included a rare stamp collection, antique William Beilby wine glasses, paintings, furniture and tortoise shell tea caddies. Mrs Mason recently attempted to access the bank account but thousands of pounds had been taken, leaving it completely empty. Electrical goods had also been bought using the money, including an iPad. She reported what had happened to police who had investigated the July attack, but is said to be frustrated that nothing has been done to get the money back. The family suspects Mason also had money hidden in other accounts which his former wife cannot access. Lovers: Debbie Mason (left) and Michael Longden (right) had dated at sixth-form college in Herefordshire . Andrea McConchie, Mrs Mason’s sister, said ‘sizeable amounts of money’ had been removed. ‘We know bank accounts have been accessed,’ she said. ‘They have bought electrical goods, an iPad, spending several hundreds of pounds in each case. They have emptied his bank account. ‘Great lengths were taken to try to deceive my sister and her lawyers. There are large amounts of money in other accounts but we don’t know where they are. ‘We want that money to be able to provide long-term for the children. Her [Mrs Mason’s] priority is the children now. She just wants to  put this behind her. It has been a tough year.’ A friend of the prisoner who was handed the bank details by Mason said he had since visited the homes and tried to access the account. ‘He [Mason] said to him: “My wife is going to divorce me. She’s going to take all my money. She had an affair”,’ he added. ‘He said he wanted him to have everything, to do whatever he wants with it. He said: “I just don’t want my wife getting anything”.’ Mason was found hanged in his cell next to a picture of his children and a goodbye note. He was due to stand trial this month charged with two counts of attempted murder. At an earlier hearing, magistrates heard how his marriage ended in January last year when his wife left with the children to live with Mr Longden in Ledbury, Herefordshire. Scene: Peter Mason is alleged to have travelled to the new home of his estranged wife Debbie where he stabbed her and her lover Michael Longden . The lovers had previously dated at sixth-form college. In July, Mason travelled to Ledbury to meet his wife of ten years in a pub to discuss financial matters and the sale of their homes. Peter Mason was found dead in his cell as he awaited trial for the attempted murder of his wife and her lover . After she left, he allegedly followed her to her new cottage and stabbed her and her new partner multiple times. Mason then tried to flee the scene in his car and hit a motorcyclist, who was uninjured, before being arrested. Mrs Mason suffered a punctured lung and serious injuries to one of her hands. Her new partner also sustained serious stab injuries to his body, head and back. Friends of Mason, who was married twice previously, said he had become ‘obsessed’ with his wife not receiving his money after she left him. A former business partner, who asked not to be named, said: ‘There had been a lot of wild talk. He felt his entire life had been taken away from him and she had left him with nothing. ‘He was very much against giving Debbie any kind of financial support. He was determined he wasn’t going to give her any money. ‘He had put the house on the market but had stopped doing the gardening because he said he couldn’t be bothered any more. I think it was his intention to let it be repossessed. ‘He would rather pull the house down and destroy it than give her anything. It was like he was harming himself in order to harm her. He wanted to create a kind of pyrrhic victory.’ Mason’s sister Adele, a dressage trainer, said: ‘He’s not got the chance [to defend himself] and I am not him. It is just very mixed feelings.’ While Mrs Mason’s family insists she has spoken to officers about the money being taken from the account, a spokesman for West Mercia Police said the force had not yet received any official reports.","Peter Mason had his bank accounts emptied so his wife Debbie would be left nothing .

Police marksmen were seen on top of a van near to the scene - they missed their target on the first shot but killed the cow on the second .

The speech set out Mr Blair’s views on religion nearly five years after he converted to Roman Catholicism shortly after leaving Downing Street. His declared Christian beliefs caused controversy from his days as Labour opposition leader - when he was rebuked by the Catholic leadership for taking communion with his family while he was still nominally an Anglican - right through to the end of his premiership. Mr Blair was at odds with the Catholic church over his gay equality regulations, which led to the closure of Catholic adoption agencies which refused to deal with gay couples, and over his liberal attitude to abortion. Tony Blair, who often found himself at odds with the Catholic church over his gay equality regulations, converted to the religion shortly after leaving Downing Street . His Downing Street spokesman Alastair Campbell tried to end speculation about the Prime Minister’s religious motivation by telling journalists ‘we don’t do God’. Yesterday Mr Blair told 4,000 people at a conference organised by the influential Anglican evangelical church Holy Trinity Brompton that he did try to do God. Mr Blair said: ‘For a long period of time, what people thought was that as society became more developed and as we became more prosperous, that faith would be relegated, that it would become a kind of relic of the past - what kind of ignorant people do but not what civilised, educated people do.' ‘I think a world without faith would be a world on the path to tragedy and disaster, I really believe that.’ He added: ‘What is the essence of our faith besides all the things we believe, certainly as Christians, about Jesus Christ and his place in our lives?’ Mr Blair told the audience that his ‘journey of faith’ had started in choir school in County Durham at the age of 10 when his father Leo, a convinced atheist, had suffered a serious stroke. ‘I remember going to school that day not knowing whether he was going to live or not,’ he said. ‘The headmaster of the school called me into his study and he said, . “I think we should kneel and say a prayer for your father.” ‘ I said to him, ‘I should tell you my father does not really believe in God.’ ‘I will never forget what he said to me - he just said to me “but God believes in him, so let us kneel and pray.” That made a big impact on me.’","Tony Blair's planned ending to address 'caused consternation' among civil servants .

The dog was found dead on the driveway of Ross Harriers hunt master Lee Peters, pictured last year . A huntmaster's dog was battered to death and dumped on his driveway in what may have been  an attack by animal rights activists. Lee Peters, who was last year fined for racially abusing an anti-hunt protester, is said to be mortified after finding his pet. The corpse had been dumped near a vandalised car inscribed  with a symbol for an animal rights group. While it would appear surprising for the activists to have killed a dog, police are said to be taking the accusations ‘very seriously’. The gruesome discovery was made at the base of the Ross Harriers hunt at Coughton, a hamlet on the Herefordshire-Gloucestershire border close to an area designated for the upcoming badger cull. Members of the hunt are said to have become concerned about tactics used by protesters in the area in the run-up to the cull. It is thought the dog, which is not used for hunts, was killed at a nearby kennel before being left on Mr Peters’s drive. Cars nearby had been inscribed by vandals with what appears to  be a symbol for the Animal Liberation Front. A source close to the hunt said: ‘This was not a very pleasant incident at all. The letters ALF were scratched into the vehicles there and the dog was dead on the drive. ‘The police are taking it extremely seriously. These are the same sorts of people threatening all sorts with the badger cull in this area. ‘The police are looking seriously at the activities of the animal  rights activists. A lot of people  are worried.’ Mr Peters, a married father-of-one, was fined almost £3,000 by magistrates in November after being found guilty of racially abusing black protester Hiba Hassan during a confrontation in the village of Aston Crews last January. 'He had initially called police to disperse the protesters but was himself arrested when they told officers that while on horseback he banged on the window of a 4x4 and when he spotted Miss Hassan, shouted: “look there’s a f****** w** in there”.’ Mortified: Master Lee Peters at Ross Harriers Boxing Day Hunt meeting at the Royal Hotel, Ross-on-Wye . Mr Peters, 33, said: ‘There was a dog killed and left on my driveway. It obviously did not die of natural causes. I’ve got a young family. This is particularly worrying.’ A spokesman for the Hunt Saboteurs Association insisted the group had ‘nothing whatsoever’ to do with the attack. West Mercia Police said it is investigating criminal damage to a car and the death of a dog at kennels near to Ross-on-Wye on March 19. A spokesman added: ‘It is believed  a dog belonging to the victim, which was on the property at the time, was killed during the incident. ‘It has not yet been established exactly how the animal died.

"By . Mark Prigg . PUBLISHED: . 05:10 EST, 9 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:26 EST, 10 April 2013 . Speeds of 'superfast' 4G broadband services are to double, provider EE announced today. Average speeds on the network currently range between 8Mbps and 12Mbps but this is to be given a boost to more than 20Mbps. The service is expected to enable users to surf the web much more quickly on mobile phones. Olaf Swantee, EE's chief executive officer, said headline speeds would reach more than 80Mbps and the benefits would be brought in for both new and current subscribers. EE is set to double the speed of its 4G network in a bid to steal a march on its rivals, which cannot launch until later this year . EE, which was formed from the merger of . Orange and T-Mobile, was the first company to offer a 4G network in the . UK and others are expected to follow suit in the coming months. For the typical user, download speeds of initial 4G networks should be . at least five to seven times faster than those of existing 3G networks. EE, formerly known as Everything Everywhere, plans to extend the service . to around 80 locations - and approximately 55% of the UK population - . by June. Prices start at £15.99 per month. 'We are ensuring that the UK remains at the forefront of the digital revolution,' he said. 'Having already pioneered 4G here, we're now advancing the country's infrastructure again with an even faster, even higher-capacity network, and at no extra cost to our customers.' Since launching 4G, the company said it had observed a 'huge shift' in the way people use mobile phones. This includes an increase in the number of consumers using video, maps and sat-nav tools.Double-speed services will be rolled out in ten cities where 4G is already in place by the summer. These include Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester and Sheffield. The announcement comes just weeks after 4G was extended to the Northern Fells in Cumbria, one of the UK's most rural regions, for the first time. The service is now available in 50 towns and cities across the country. EE aims to reach one million 4G customers by the end of the year. Kester Mann of analysts CCS Insight, said the move is designed to put pressure on EE's competitors, which will launch later this year. 'The fact that EE has chosen to announce that it is doubling the average speed of its 4G network to 20Mbps in ten UK cities, shows shrewd timing on the operator’s part and capitalising on its pioneering role as the leader in 4G. EE has already undertaken a massive ad campaign in a bid to capitalise on its advantage . 4G offers far faster speeds, and for EE customers, the top speed in set to double . 'It raises the bar for competitors Vodafone and O2, which we expect to launch rival networks in May or June. 'Having spent more than its rivals at the 4G auction, Vodafone could assume a position to replicate EE's move. 'However, this does put O2 at a competitive disadvantage as it failed to secure any additional   spectrum above 800MHz.' EE said it would also double the amount of spectrum bandwidth dedicated to 4G to give customers better access to 'some of the fastest mobile speeds in the world' while 'revolutionising working practices'. With newly boosted speeds, customers should be able to upload or download pictures in high definition with greater resolution or view and share videos without delay. Matthew Howett, telecoms regulation analyst at research firm Ovum, said EE's latest move would pose a challenge to its competitors who plan to roll out 4G services later this year. 'Given EE's large and contiguous holding of spectrum at 1800MHz, this puts them in a very strong position and makes it more difficult for their peers to play catch-up once they launch networks in the coming weeks and months,' he added. He suggested that today's announcement showed EE was also keen to 'dampen rumours' of weak take-up.","Average speeds on the network currently range between 8Mbps and 12Mbps but this is to be given a boost to more than 20Mbps .

People in Protestant countries work harder because they feel guiltier about taking time off, a study has found. And while unemployment generally makes all people unhappy, it is twice as likely seriously to affect the mental wellbeing of Protestants as those of other denominations. The findings suggest that the economic . downturn may have had a far more serious effect on people in Britain . than other countries, with joblessness more likely to have led to . depression among Christian workers. Hard at work: People in Protestant countries work harder because they feel guiltier about taking time off, a study has found (file picture) Scientists from Holland studied more than 150,000 people in 82 countries to find out whether there was any truth behind the notion of a Protestant work ethic. The countries deemed historically Protestant by the researchers, from Groningen University, included the UK, the US Australia, Germany, Holland, Switzerland, Norway, Sweden, Finland, Latvia, Estonia, South Africa and Zimbabwe. They found those who were unemployed in all countries said they were less happy when out of work, regardless of religious denomination, but this was exacerbated among those in Protestant countries. In fact, Protestants are generally 40 per cent less happy when unemployed than others, they reported. Researchers took into account a number of factors which could have skewed results - such as marital status, age, gender, income, education and health. Dutch economist Dr André van Hoorn, who led the study, said: ‘The negative effect of unemployment on self-reported happiness was twice as strong for Protestants compared with non-Protestants. ‘We found that the work ethic does exist and that individual Protestants and historically Protestant societies appear to value work much more than others. ‘At the individual level, unemployment hurts Protestants much more than it does non-Protestants. Protestantism causes a stronger work ethic. Misery: While unemployment generally makes all people unhappy, it is twice as likely seriously to affect the mental wellbeing of Protestants as those of other denominations (file picture) ‘Interestingly, it is not so much Protestant individuals who are hurt more by being unemployed as it is individuals - both Protestants and non-Protestants - living in Protestant societies.’ He added that the results supported sociologist Max Weber’s idea that a strong work ethic is something which has evolved from historical Protestantism, rather than contemporary interpretations of Protestantism.Weber first came up with the notion of a Protestant work ethic in 1904, suggesting that the religious concept of achieving God-given grace through frugality and working hard was one of the crucibles of capitalism. Despite the theory being widely accepted since, the Dutch researchers sought to test it. Cary Cooper, Professor of Organisational Psychology and Health at Lancaster University, said the study ‘shows that the Protestant work ethic is alive and kicking’. He added: ‘It was very evident during the Thatcher and Blair years and the current coalition emphasis on the negative aspects of benefits are also evidence of it. ‘It is very much a cultural thing. In the UK, for example, people work for achievement; in the US, with fewer safety nets - no redundancy [pay] for example - fear is likely a driver. ‘I think 2008 made some differences. People who had followed the work ethic for years found themselves without a job. All the sacrifices - working long hours, not seeing the kids - had not worked out. 'We may find that’s damaged the work ethic and people are putting less focus on work and more on a balance between work and the rest of their life.’","People in Protestant countries feel guilty about time off .

Cleared: PC Mark Milton, who caused outrage by testing a patrol car at 159mph, was cleared of dangerous driving again after doing 108mph in a 40mph zone . A policeman who caused an outcry when he was cleared of dangerous driving after hitting speeds of 159mph was yesterday let off again for crashing his patrol car in a high-speed chase. PC Mark Milton, 46, lost control of his BMW 5 Series while driving at a 'grossly excessive' 108mph in a 40mph zone. He careered over a grass verge with such force that a front tyre shredded. But he walked free from court after claiming he was a 'very experienced' driver who had been 'dazzled by a light'. The crash came after he made headlines in 2003 when he was cleared of dangerous driving after he was caught doing 159mph on a motorway. Campaigners hit out at the time after a judge said Milton was the 'crème de la crème' of police drivers and he needed to speed to 'familiarise' himself with his new car. Milton's latest court appearance was the result of a crash on October 26, 2011. He told Worcester Crown Court he had been 'in a hurry' after leaving the Princess Royal Hospital in Telford, Shropshire, and was heading towards Whitchurch when he spotted a speeding Audi he suspected had been stolen. Milton, who has worked for West Mercia Police for 21 years, sped along the A442 through the village of Cold Hatton before crashing. His patrol car's black box recorded him reaching 108mph in a 40mph zone before he smashed into the central reservation at 92mph. Milton told the court he mounted a verge because he was distracted by a dazzling light in the corner of his vision. The policeman, who walked from the wreckage unharmed, and even managed to cycle home after his shift, was yesterday cleared of dangerous driving after telling the jury the crash was nothing to do with excessive speed. The court heard he had been an advanced driver since 1995 and was 'very experienced' at handling fast cars. The officer, who is also trained in . the use of firearms, faced widespread condemnation after he was recorded . doing 159mph on the M54 in Shropshire in the early hours of December 5, . 2003. Safety campaigners were shocked when . he was cleared of any wrongdoing, with district judge Bruce Morgan, at . Ludlow magistrates' court, criticising the decision to prosecute. He . said it was necessary for policemen such as Milton to practise their . skills. Accident: PC Mark Milton was cleared again at Worcester Crown Court after crashing his car while driving at 108mph in a 40mph zone . Anger: PC Mark Milton was driving a Vauxhall Vectra GSi 3.2 like this when he was caught doing 159pmh on the motorway a decade ago . He added that the expertise he showed behind the wheel was the driving equivalent of being a concert pianist. After the case, the Royal Society for . the Prevention of Accidents said travelling at such speeds could never . be justified and called for stricter guidelines for police drivers. The case returned to court after an . appeal by the Director of Public Prosecutions and Milton was convicted . of the crime before he was again cleared in 2007 by the High Court, . which ruled the decision to find him guilty was 'misdirected'. It was considered a landmark case, resulting in courts having to take into account drivers' 'special skills' when prosecuting. Milton, of Market Drayton, Shropshire, yesterday declined to comment outside court.","PC Mark Milton, 46, shredded the tyre of his BMW 5 Series car while driving .

Mick Philpott, pictured in 2011, in the trousers which would eventually help to convict him when traces of the petrol used to start the fire were found on them . The depths of Mick Philpott’s depravity were revealed yesterday in a letter he wrote from prison, boasting that if he won freedom he and his wife would celebrate by ‘raping each other’. The note to friends detailed how he planned to get blind drunk and commit the assault straight after visiting the graves of the children he and wife Mairead had killed. The correspondence emerged as his lawyers pleaded with a judge for a lenient sentence because the father of 17 was a ‘very good’ parent. The court heard that he was on bail for a violent road-rage attack at the time of the house fire in which the children died. His wife’s barrister said losing her children was a ‘sentence in itself’. Philpott, 56, and Mairead, 32, were . convicted on Tuesday of killing their six children. Their friend Paul . Mosley, 46, was also found guilty of six counts of manslaughter. They . will be sentenced this morning. Over the past eight weeks, Nottingham . Crown Court has heard how they set fire to their house last May as part . of a plan to frame Philpott’s former live-in lover Lisa Willis. She had walked out of the shared . three-bedroom semi in Allenton, Derby, with her five children and the . thousands of pounds in benefits they were worth to Philpott. The fire was also set in an attempt to . get a bigger council house, a demand Philpott had infamously made six . years earlier on the Jeremy Kyle Show. The plan went tragically wrong, . however, with the petrol-fuelled blaze burning out of control. Jade Philpott, ten, and brothers Duwayne, 13, John, nine, Jack, eight, Jesse, six and Jayden, five, all died. Later, however, Philpott was totally remorseless. In a letter written from prison where . he was on remand, he boasted: ‘God, when we are free, which we will be, . we’re all going to get p*****. ‘But me and my darling beloved wife, . the most important thing that we will do when this happens is to spend . the whole day with our babies, at the graveside. Depraved: This Morning presenter Phillip Schofield holds a letter which Mick Philpott sent to friends while he was in custody awaiting trial for killing six of his children in a house fire . Sickening: This passage in the letter tells how Mick Philpott and his wife planned to celebrate their freedom by 'raping each other' after visiting their children's graves . Lack of remorse: Six wooden crosses mark the graves of the Philpott children which Mick Philpott intended to visit after his release from prison, but not before getting drunk first . ‘We don’t care if it’s raining, gale force winds, snowing. I’m going straight up there. ‘Then we shall probably – no, we will – rape each other. Then we can all celebrate our freedom.’ Superimposed on the words were eight pink hearts, one each for him and his wife and six for the children they killed. The letter was sent to Mick and Sharon Russell, close friends for 20 years. The couple said they were disgusted. ‘That’s his attitude, he’s highly sex driven,’ Mr Russell said. ‘I wouldn’t leave Sharon with him on his own.’ Philpott showed little genuine emotion . following the fire. He ‘loved’ being a local celebrity and was seen . ‘touching up’ his wife in the hospital where her son Duwayne was dying . after the fire, the former friend added. Appalled: Mick Philpott's long-term friends Mick and Sharon Russell appear on This Morning with former MP Ann Widdecombe to discuss their relationship with the house-blaze killer . More interested in celebrating than grieving: Mr Schofield reads a passage from the letter, which also told how Mick Philpott intended to get very drunk as soon as he left prison .

Mrs Russell said Mairead had planned a . new outfit for her children’s funeral, which she and her husband were . later banned from attending. ‘I was quite shocked at it and said, . “You can’t wear that.” She said, “Will it be all right for the after . party?” It was disgusting the way they were behaving.’ Another friend, who asked not to be . named, said Mairead got drunk on alcopops at a neighbour’s barbecue in . the days after the fire, and showed off an £80 pair of pink trainers she . had bought with money donated by sympathetic members of the public. In court yesterday, lawyers for the killers pleaded with Mrs Justice Thirlwall to consider mitigating circumstances. Philpott’s lengthy criminal history . was read out. He appeared in court a week before the blaze last year for . a road-rage attack during which he punched driver Jon Welham, 42, who . had his daughter Emma, 13, with him in the car. Angry scenes outside Nottingham crown court as Mick Philpott and Paul Mosley leave via prison van . Sentencing was adjourned till today . The assault happened after Philpott . swerved in front of him, forcing him to stop, because he believed Mr . Welham had cut him up at a roundabout. Philpott pleaded guilty to common . assault but denied dangerous driving and was bailed awaiting trial. In . 1991, he received a two-year conditional discharge for headbutting a . colleague and in 2010 was given a police caution after slapping Mairead . and dragging her outside by her hair. Anthony Orchard QC said Philpott’s . conviction for stabbing his former girlfriend Kim Hill 27 times in 1978, . revealed by the Mail yesterday, was a ‘long time ago’ and said there . was no evidence of anything like it being repeated. But he was immediately cut off by the judge, who retorted: ‘There’s been violence in every single relationship, has there not?’ The lawyer added: ‘Despite Mr . Philpott’s faults he was a very good father and loved those children. He . is, as is Mairead, a parent who lost six children. He’s never been able . to grieve or even to bury them. ‘He will have to live with the hatred and hostility of the press and the public for the rest of his life.’ Shaun Smith QC, for Mairead Philpott, said she was ‘an extremely good mother to all 11 children’. ‘She will be forever known as a child . killer,’ he added, noting that she might face threats in prison because . of the nature of her crimes.

Spared jail: Radu Cristea (pictured today) was preparing to fly an Airbus 318 from London Heathrow to Bucharest . A Romanian aerial acrobatics champion who performed alongside the Red Arrows turned up to pilot a passenger jet almost two and a half times over the drink-fly limit, a court heard today. Radu Cristea, 38, was preparing to fly an Airbus 318 from London Heathrow to Bucharest when security officers at one of the boarding gates smelt alcohol on his breath. He called the police, who tested experienced pilot and father-of-two Cristea in his cockpit just half an hour before his plane was due to take off with 30 passengers in February. The breathalyser test came back positive for alcohol and the captain, who had drunk three large glasses of wine the night before and had just five hours sleep, was arrested. He was almost two and a half times over the legal flying limit as he had 49mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood, Isleworth Crown Court heard today. The limit is 20mg per 100ml of blood. The limit for driving is 80mg per 100ml. But Judge Jonathan Lowen decided not to send Cristea to prison today after hearing he would lose his job if he was jailed. Instead he handed him a three-month suspended sentence. When questioned by police, Cristea told officers that the night before he was due to captain the three-hour Tarom flight he drank three large glasses of wine before going to bed and had ‘no idea’ he was unfit to fly. Neil Fitzgibbon, defending, said: ‘He had three large glasses of red wine and did not have a meal before going to bed at 12.30am. When he arrived at the airport for 6am he had no idea he would be over the flight limit. He thought drinking three glasses of wine the night before was wholly acceptable. ‘He thinks his failure to have a meal may have been the contributing factor. He takes safety in the air as a critical factor, something that cannot be understated. For his to have fallen below his usually high standards is a devastating blow.’ Hearing: Isleworth Crown Court (pictured) was told how Cristea, a Romanian aerial acrobatics champion, was two and a half times over the legal flying limit as he had 49mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood . Cristea was a very experienced and . competent pilot who had been flying since he was 16 and held an . ‘unblemished’ record, Isleworth Crown Court heard. After being crowned the Romanian . Flying Acrobatic Champion, he flew with the Red Arrows as part of the . Hawks of Romania flying team in the UK. He joined the state-run Romanian airline Tarom in 2008. ‘Mr Cristea has been flying all his . adult life,’ Mr Fitzgibbons told the court. ‘He began when he was 16, . eventually becoming the Romanian Flying Acrobatic Champion. ‘He was a gliding instructor for 12 . years and trained hundreds of other glider pilots. After that he moved . over to a commercial flying career. His whole world revolves around . flying. ‘He has flown many thousands of hours . and has performed all over the world. He has performed with the Red . Arrows previously as part of the Hawks of Romania. He is highly regarded and has a wholly unblemished career.’ In the air: File photo of a Tarom plane.

Sobering numbers: World Trade Organization Director-General Pascal Lamy warned of a Depression-era protectionism (file photo) Global trade almost stagnated last year and the world is at risk of a return to Depression-era protectionism, a leading international watchdog warned yesterday. The World Trade Organisation said trade between nations grew by just 2 per cent in 2012 – down from 5.2 per cent in 2011 and the second-worst figure since records began in 1981. The Geneva-based body said trade would increase by 3.3 per cent this year instead of the 4.5 per cent it forecast  in September. WTO director-general Pascal Lamy described the figures as ‘sobering’. He said it was now more likely that countries would resort to putting up trade barriers in a futile attempt to protect their economies from outside competition. ‘The threat of protectionism may be greater now than at any time since the start of the crisis, since other policies to restore growth have been tried and found wanting,’ said Mr Lamy. A wave of protectionist measures such as trade barriers exacerbated the Great Depression in the 1930s and it is feared that a return to such policies would be a disaster for the global economy. The threat of a worldwide currency war, in which countries deliberately devalue their currencies to make exports more competitive and drive economic growth, could lead to governments putting up tariffs to protect their manufacturers. Sir Mervyn King, governor of the Bank of England, has warned that such measures  could ‘lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world’ with every country suffering ‘ruinous consequences’. Global trade has grown at an average rate of 5.3 per cent a year over the past two decades, according to the WTO. But the two per cent rise in 2012 was the weakest increase since records began in 1981. The only worse performance was in 2009 during the depths of the Great Recession when trade fell. The WTO blamed the sharp slowdown on weak economic growth in developed countries and continued uncertainty over the future of the crisis-torn euro. ‘The events of 2012 should serve as a . reminder that the structural flaws in economies that were revealed by . the economic crisis have not been fully addressed, despite important . progress in some areas,’ said Mr Lamy. ‘Repairing these fissures needs . to be the priority for 2013.’ Risk: Sir Mervyn King has warned deliberately devaluing of currencies could ¿lead to a disastrous collapse in activity around the world' He went on: ‘The final trade figures for 2012 are quite sobering,’ sadding that 2013 would see ‘more of the same’. The WTO warned that a ‘double speed’ global economy was emerging with developing countries outperforming richer nations. It said: ‘Improved economic prospects for the United States in 2013 should only partly offset the continued weakness in the European Union, whose economy is expected to remain flat or even contract slightly this year according to consensus estimates. ‘China’s growth should continue to outpace other leading economies, cushioning the slowdown, but exports will still be constrained by weak demand in Europe.’ But Mr Lamy said global trade would pick up next year with growth of five per cent. The 158 economies which make up the WTO set trade rules among themselves in an attempt to ensure a level playing field and spur growth by opening markets and removing trade barriers, including subsidies, excessive taxes and regulations. Created in 1995, the WTO launched its Doha round of talks in 2001 with the stated aim of underpinning development in poorer nations, but the talks have faltered.","Trade between nations grew with a mere two per cent last year .

A mother has spoken of her grief after discovering the baby son she aborted on medical grounds was actually a girl. Lilias McConville, 49, named the baby Henry, after her husband, and spent years mourning the loss of the son that she aborted in 1992 when doctors said he had Spina Bifida. The mother-of-four said since learning the truth, she has struggled to come to terms with the fact that she should have been mourning the death of a daughter. Lilias McConville is suing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for £15,000 after she was told the baby she aborted on medical grounds and named Henry was actually a girl . She claims she was misled about the gender of the baby and is now suing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for £15,000, which is being contested by the trust. Mrs McConville said: 'It's not about money. My wee lassie has walked in darkness. I just want closure. 'I can't get on with my life.' Mrs McConville,  of Knightswood, Glasgow, said she only discovered the baby's true gender in 2001 after she contacted the hospital in light of the Alder Hey Children's Hospital organ scandal. When the hospital sent the baby's post mortem, which revealed it to be a girl, Mrs McConville said she 'almost collapsed'. The court papers say she was 'distraught' and that she had spent 'approximately nine years grieving and . remembering a son whom she named after her husband'. She says she suffers from an adjustment disorder, as well as anxiety and depression. Mrs McConville had the abortion when she was four months pregnant at Queen Mother's Hospital, in Glasgow, when doctors discovered her unborn child had Spina Bifida . She claims she has suffered from loss, injury and damage as a result of the alleged misinformation. Mrs McConville and her family say they mourned . Henry by visiting a memorial at Glasgow’s Queen Mother’s Maternity . Hospital and dedicating a poem to him. The mother-of-four had the termination in August 1992 - four months into her pregnancy - after being told her . unborn child had Spina Bifida - a problem with the development of the . spine. Papers lodged at Glasgow Sheriff Court state the mother was 'extremely distressed' on admission to the Queen Mother hospital. The document reads: 'Her baby was delivered at 7.35pm. Mrs McConville thereafter was recorded as being very quiet and subdued.' She claims that an hour later, when the doctor checked on her, she was told the baby was a boy. The court papers said: 'After she became aware of the sex of the foetus, Mrs McConville decided she would like to name the baby Henry.' She claims that weeks after the operation and post mortem she met with medics and that she was not told then about the sex of the baby. A poem was written for her baby and it along with a card in the name of 'Henry' was put in the Book of Remembrance at the hospital. It is said Mrs McConville visited the hospital every year with her family to 'remember the son that they lost'. The 49-year-old claims that Yorkhill Trust, which became part of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, is liable for their staff including the doctor who she alleges told her the wrong gender. In the paperwork the hospital says it is 'believed to be true that Mrs McConville was not advised by the Trust that the foetus had been determined to be female'. Evidence is due to be heard a hearing at Glasgow Sheriff Court next month.","Lilias McConville, 49, is suing NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde for £15,000 .

A picture was released by detectives today of a man suspected of trying to abduct a three-year-old British girl in the Canary Islands. A family from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise in Lanzarote when a man - believed to be British - attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop. The victim's father noticed she was missing, left a store and spotted the youngster being led around a corner into an alleyway by a man, who was holding her by the hand. He shouted out and ran up to his daughter, pulling her away from the man who then left the scene. The incident has chilling similarities to the disappearance of three-year-old Madeleine McCann, who went missing from her apartment in Portugal in 2007 and has never been seen since. Do you know him? Thames Valley Police have issued this photograph of a man they want to speak to in connection with the attempted abduction of a three-year-old British girl in Lanzarote . The family were on the beach a short time later and saw the same man, who spoke fluent English, sitting between some rocks and acting suspiciously. The victim's father confronted the suspect, but he left the scene before police arrived. But the quick-thinking family took photos of the man, which have been released by police today, in an attempt to identify him. The suspect is described as white, with pasty skin, of stocky build with broad shoulders, 5ft 8ins to 5ft 9ins, 40 to 55 years old, with short dark hair and a dark moustache. The incident happened on January . 30 last year, but Thames Valley Police spokesman said the delay in . issuing the pictures was due to Spanish police having to exhaust their . investigation before the appeal to find the man could move to Britain. Location: A family from Milton Keynes, Buckinghamshire, were on holiday in Costa Teguise when a man, believed to be British, attempted to kidnap the girl in a shop . Investigating officer Detective Constable John Swallow: 'This is a very concerning incident in which a young girl was led away from her family by an unknown man. 'The victim's father knew it was his daughter being led around the corner because he recognised her flashing trainers. 'The incident was reported to Thames Valley Police after initially being reported to police in Lanzarote and we have been making enquiries to try and establish the man's identity since then. 'We are working closely with the Spanish authorities and Interpol on this case and will continue to do so. 'We have reason to believe he may be a British citizen as he spoke fluent English and made references to being on holiday. 'I am appealing for anyone who recognises the man in the images or has information on his whereabouts to contact police as soon as possible.' Madeleine, left, and a computer generated image of how she may look now, six years after she disappeared . A near six-year search for Madeleine has yet to solve the mystery of her disappearance from the Algarve resort of Praia da Luiz on May 3, 2007. There have been dozens of alleged sightings and leads over the years, but nothing has come close to establishing whether she is alive or dead. In the latest development last month, detectives believe a team of British cleaners may hold the key to her whereabouts. Owners of apartments in the Portuguese holiday complex where Maddie and her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann, were staying when she vanished have been asked about cleaners in the area who had a white van. One property owner said police told him they are looking for a group of six to eight British cleaners who drove around the Praia da Luz area in a white van, working in holiday apartments.

Lying lifeless on the bleached grass of a South African game reserve is the latest rhino to fall victim to poachers in their ruthless pursuit of the creatures' valuable horns. This grisly photographs reflect the damage wrought by increasing numbers of poachers eager to exploit demand for rhino horn - which now has a street value higher than gold in some countries. The rhino, which was shot at the Nwanetsi picnic site on the famous game reserve, is the 203rd to be poached in South Africa this year alone. Poaching: The carcass of a rhino is seen lying in the dirt at the Nwanetsi picnic site in Kruger National Park, South Africa .

Lady Nora Colthurst accepted undisclosed libel damages and a public apology for the 'distressing' allegations, made by the daughter of her husband's lover . The former wife of the owner of Blarney Castle, home to the Blarney Stone, has been awarded damages after being branded a 'psycho' on an internet blog. Lady Nora Colthurst accepted undisclosed libel damages and a public apology for the 'distressing' allegations, made by the daughter of her husband's lover. Lady Colthurst, 57, had been married for 22 years to Sir Charles Colthurst. The colourful owner of the 15th century Castle, near Cork, in Ireland, moved his mistress, Caroline Myers, a divorcee from Lincolnshire, into the family home as he waited for his separation from his wife to be finalised. In a hearing at the High Court in London, Kate Wilson, for Lady Colthurst, told Mr Justice Tugendhat the marriage ended after Sir Charles began a relationship with the mother of Rachel Myers. Miss Myers made the allegations on her internet blog in 2005, when she was a teenager. She is now aged 26. In the blog, named 'Where their wars are merry and their songs sad' she labelled mother of four Lady Colthurst,a 'psycho' and urged people to run away from her if they saw her. Despite being 'live online' for five years, it only came to Lady Colthurst’s attention in the summer of 2011. Ms Wilson said: 'The defendant's blog remained online . for many years. 'It only came to Lady Colthurst's attention in the . summer of 2011 after she carried out a Google search on her name. 'Unsurprisingly, she was very distressed by the defamatory allegations. 'The claimant then discovered that . various people had read the blog post over the years and, unfortunately, . that it remained sufficiently prominent on the internet that it was . still being read up until it was removed, partially in September 2011 . and fully in March 2012.' The High Court heard Sir Charles began a relationship with the mother of Rachel Myers, who made the allegations on her internet blog in 2005, when she was a teenager .

She told the judge the allegations were untrue and Lady Colthurst, who now lives in Midhurst, Sussex, was not a danger to anyone including Miss Myers. Felicity McMahon, counsel for Ms . Myers, told Mr Justice Tugendhat: 'Ms Myers first published the blog . post when she was 18 years old. 'After she was notified of the . claimant's claim, she took steps to remove her blog from the internet . and this was achieved some time afterwards. 'She did not appreciate until this claim was brought how widely her blog had been read or how far her allegations might spread. 'Ms Myers withdraws her allegations . unreservedly and apologises to Lady Colthurst for the distress and . embarrassment which this matter caused her.'

It proved to be a defining moment during her time as Prime Minister and in death, the Falklands War will again play a key role. Further details of Baroness Thatcher’s funeral arrangements emerged yesterday and her military triumph in the South Atlantic will take centre stage. Outside St Paul’s, the gun carriage carrying her coffin will be greeted by a guard of honour formed of 1st Battalion Welsh Guards, the regiment which lost 32 men in the bombing of the troop ship Sir Galahad during the 1982 conflict. Military honours from parliament to st pauls . The ten-strong bearer party has been deliberately chosen from ships, units and stations ‘notable for their service during the Falklands Campaign’. In all, more than 700 members of the Armed Forces will take part in the funeral next Wednesday, lining the streets as the cortege travels the two miles from Westminster to the cathedral. David Cameron said: ‘In a week from now, as people gather in London to lay Margaret Thatcher to rest, the sun will be rising over the Falklands. And because of her courage, and the skill, bravery and sacrifice of our Armed Forces – it will rise again for freedom.’ Details of the service and the official guest list will be released in the coming days as a Whitehall committee draws up plans to execute Operation True Blue, the codename for the funeral. War leader's funeral: Baroness Thatcher will be carried into St Paul's by units linked to the Falklands War . Margaret Thatcher stands proudly on Victory Green, Port Stanley, during her visit to mark the tenth anniversary of the Falklands War . The Bishop of London, the Right Rev Richard Chartres, will preach the sermon at the funeral. A friend of the Prince of Wales who knows the Thatcher family, he was, ironically, at the centre of a fierce row at the Falklands thanksgiving service between Lady Thatcher and then Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Robert Runcie. She furiously accused Dr Runcie of being unpatriotic when, preaching a message of reconciliation rather than triumphalism, he asked the congregation to pray for relatives of the Argentine dead. The sermon was written by the Archbishop’s chaplain at the time – Richard Chartres. There is expected to be music from Elgar and a selection of hymns and readings agreed by Lady Thatcher and her aides, including William Wordsworth’s ‘Ode: Intimations of Immortality’. Map: The funeral procession will run from Parliament to St Paul's Cathedral via Trafalgar Square . The final bill for the funeral may approach £10million. Lady Thatcher’s family is meeting an unspecified amount of the expense, thought to cover transport, flowers and the cremation, with the Government funding the rest, including security. Foreign Secretary William Hague said: ‘When it comes to money, the rebate she negotiated for this country from the EU has brought us so far £75billion…I think that puts money in perspective.’ The widow of Falklands war hero Lieutenant Colonel Herbert ‘H’ Jones has been invited to Lady Thatcher’s funeral. The 42-year-old officer was awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross when he was shot charging an Argentine trench while commanding 2nd Battalion, The Parachute Regiment, during the Battle of Goose Green. His wife Sara, who has received a CBE for her services to forces charities, will attend the service at St Paul’s. Honoured: A British Royal Marine watches over captured Argentine soldiers following the Battle of Goose Green, during which Lieutenant Colonel Herbert 'H' Jones, 42, was fatally wounded. He would later be awarded a posthumous Victoria Cross for his valiance . Freda McKay, the mother of Sergeant Ian McKay, who also won a posthumous VC, is expected to be invited. The 29-year-old who served with 3rd Battalion The Parachute Regiment laid down his life to save his comrades when he fell taking on an Argentine gun post. Others military personnel tipped to be invited include Major General Julian Thompson, who commanded 3 Commando Brigade Royal Marines in the conflict, General Sir Michael Rose, who commanded the SAS during the conflict, and General Sir Peter de la Billiere, British commander during the first Gulf War. The bearer party will include representatives of the Scots Guards, who fought one of the bloodiest battles of the conflict with Argentina – the night assault on Mount Tumbledown – and the Parachute Regiment, who turned the tide of the war by re-capturing Goose Green. Once the coffin is transferred from a hearse to a gun carriage, this is the route it will take to the doors of St Paul's . Did Baroness Thatcher face a tougher job as prime minister than David Cameron does today? FAMILY: Her twin children Sir Mark and Carol Thatcher will lead the family mourners. Both Mark’s present and ex-wife are expected to be at the service. Sir Mark, 59, who has spent 25 years living and working abroad will be accompanied by his second wife Sarah, whom he married in 2008. His first wife, Diane, who lives in Dallas, Texas, is expected to travel to London next week accompanied by the couple’s two children, Michael, 24, and 19-year-old Amanda – Lady Thatcher’s only grandchildren.

Sombre: Sir Mark and Carol Thatcher, pictured either side of their late mother Margaret during the funeral of her husband Denis, will lead the family of mourners . ROYAL FAMILY: The Queen and Prince Philip broke with tradition by agreeing to attend the funeral. The only other time a reigning monarch had attended the final farewell of a Prime Minister was in 1965, when the Queen joined the congregation for the funeral of Winston Churchill. The extraordinary gesture delighted Lady Thatcher’s friends and allies disappointed that she would not be honoured with a full state funeral. No other members of the Royal Family will be present. Attending: The Queen with Lady Thatcher at a dinner to mark the former Prime Minister's 70th birthday, left, and pictured again with Baroness Thatcher, while opening a new wing of the National Portrait Gallery in London in 2000, right, will break with protocol to attend the funeral . WORLD LEADERS: President Obama and wife, Michelle, are expected to be invited along with the first President George Bush, who was in the White House while Lady Thatcher was in Downing Street, and his wife, Barbara, but it has not yet been made clear who will make the trip. Former First Lady Nancy Reagan, 91, will not travel to London and had asked the chairman of the Ronald Reagan Presidential Foundation to represent her. ‘Mrs Reagan is heartbroken over Baroness Thatcher’s death and would really like to be there in person to pay her respects,’ said her spokeswoman. ‘Unfortunately, she is no longer able to make that kind of a trip, so will not be attending the funeral.’ Dignitaries: President Obama and wife, Michelle, left, are expected to be invited along with the first President George Bush, who was in the White House while Lady Thatcher was in Downing Street, and his wife, Barbara, pictured right . The last president of apartheid South Africa, FW de Klerk, will attend. De Klerk, who ordered the release of Nelson Mandela from jail and then agreed to the negotiations that ended apartheid, will be with his wife, Elita. Others likely to be invited include Mikhail Gorbachev, the former president of the Soviet Union. POLITICIANS: David Cameron will be joined by former Prime Minister Tony Blair and his wife Cherie, and his successor Gordon Brown and his wife Sarah. Sir John Major will be among senior politicians from the Thatcher years much in evidence but there may be a couple of notable exceptions. Her political opponent Lord Kinnock and his wife Glenys are likely to snub her funeral. When Lord Heseltine, the former Conservative Cabinet Minister who launched the leadership contest that ended  Baroness Thatcher’s rule, was asked if he would attend her funeral, he did not respond. THE RITZ: Ten members of staff from the Ritz, where Baroness Thatcher died on Monday, have been invited to her funeral as thanks for the care she received. HER CARERS: Constant companions, New Zealanders Kate and Janice, and her ever-faithful police protection officers are expected to be inside St Paul’s. GRANTHAM: Councillor Kelham Cooke of the Grantham and Stamford Conservative Association said that around 20 of their members were expected to make the journey to London and planned to line the route of the funeral procession in order to pay their respects.","The Iron Lady had asked for a war leader's funeral, Downing Street say .

"PUBLISHED: . 12:09 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:19 EST, 11 April 2013 . Sussex Arms landlord Paul Charalambous (pictured) was fined £70,000 after admitting negligence appeared in court today . A woman suffered a fractured spine when an eight and a half stone plant pot fell on her head as she enjoyed a drink outside a pub. Margaret Jackson, 49, was outside the Sussex Arms near Paddington, west London, when the 54kg (120lb) planter dropped 10ft off the wall. The painter and decorator suffered severe head injuries and spent two and a half months in hospital. She was left with a fractured spine and broken ribs following the incident on October 3, 2010. Mrs Jackson is now on the mend but prosecutor Adrian Chaplin said at Southwark Crown Court: 'She is unlikely to ever be able to return to her former work.' Polynikis Charalambous, 34, who owns the pub, admitted negligence for failing to ensure punters were not exposed to risk. He and his company were fined a total of £70,000. Southwark Crown Court heard the planter was on the first-floor windowsill of the gastro pub. But a guest who was staying in the hotel upstairs opened the window further than he should have been able to dislodging the pot, causing it to crash to the ground. Mr Chaplain said: 'It weighed 54 kilos (8.5 stone) and fell 2.7m. 'It struck Margaret Jackson who was sitting underneath enjoying a drink. 'There was awning above so anyone sitting underneath would have been completely unaware of what was above them. 'It was just a bolt from the blue.' The court heard the planter, which had an artificial tree in it, was weighed down with sand and concrete so it did not buckle in the wind. Mr Charalambous, who runs the pub and . the Stylotel Hotel above with his family, thought it was 'unthinkable' anything like this could ever happen. Matthew Kerruish-Jones, defending, said the company director had since undertaken numerous health and safety training. He added: 'He and his family are truly sorry about this tragic accident leading to Mrs Jackson's tragic injuries. 'They were horrified and surprised by the circumstances. 'This was a combination of poor judgement and lack of appreciation to what the risks could be which inevitably lead to this dreadful accident.' A judge heard it was a 'cruel irony' that had the windows been changed in 2009, without which the incident would never have occurred. Margaret Jackson was drinking with friends at The Sussex Arms in Paddington, London (pictured) when the plant pot fell on her head in August 2010 . Sentencing Mr Charalambous, Judge Nicholas Loraine-Smith said: 'I have to begin with Margaret Jackson, whose life has been so dramatically and sadly altered by what happened that day. 'One moment she was sitting and drinking with her friends, the next she suffered serious and potentially fatal injuries. 'She spent two and a half months in hospital and now finds herself unable to live the life she enjoyed. 'That planter, for three years, had been sitting in a position which carried a very forseeable risk of injury and death. 'This should have been prevented.

A midwife has apologised today for telling an Indian woman who was suffering a miscarriage that she could not have a termination in Ireland because it was a 'Catholic thing'. Ann Maria Burke admitted she made the remark to Savita Halappanavar in University Hospital Galway but insisted she meant it in kindness. The patient later died of septicemia. The senior midwife said she used the reference to Catholic teaching after the 31-year-old dentist said she was Hindu and she would have ended her pregnancy in her home country. Midwife Ann Maria Burke, pictured outside Galway Coroners court, apologised for telling Savita Halappanavar she could not have a termination because it was a 'Catholic thing' Savita Halappanavar died of a heart attack caused by septicaemia after being refused an abortion and delivering a dead baby . 'I did mention it’s a Catholic country,' Ms Burke told Galway coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin. 'I didn’t mention it in a hurtful context. It was in a conversation we had.' Ms Burke said she regrets making the statement, which the coroner said 'went around the world'. 'I’m sorry that I said it,' she added. Mrs Halappanavar, 31, was admitted to hospital on Sunday, October 21 and delivered a dead baby daughter three days later. She died the following Sunday of a heart attack caused by septicaemia due to E.coli. The inquest, in its third day at Galway courthouse, has heard claims that a consultant obstetrician, Dr Katherine Astbury, made the remark to Mrs Halappanavar and her husband Praveen, and also that the midwife said it. Dr Astbury, who was cross-examined over her treatment of Mrs Halappanavar for several hours today, denies using the phrase. But the consultant has admitted there were system failures in her care and she also warned of a lack of legal clarity for doctors treating pregnant women who suffer health risks. Mrs Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to the hospital in pain. Asked by Mr Gleeson if it would have been . insensitive, uncivilised and wrong to use the word Catholic to the . patient, Dr Astbury said: 'It’s certainly not something I would say.' Dr Astbury revealed there is confusion over how her patient was cared for, including that she had been unaware of blood test abnormalities and that the patient’s vitals should have been checked more regularly after her foetal membrane ruptured. The senior medic was asked by coroner Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin if the two aspects of Mrs Halappanavar’s care could be seen as system failures and she replied 'yes'. Dr Astbury revealed that she initially refused a request from the Halappanavars to terminate the pregnancy two days after her admission to hospital as at that time there was no risk to her life. Praveen Halappanavar, pictured arriving at the inquest, collapsed and vomited after his wife's death . 'She was well,' said Dr Astbury under cross-examination. 'There was no risk to her life. If you need to give somebody medication to deliver and there’s a foetal heartbeat, my understanding is that legally you are considered to be terminating.' Dr Astbury spoke in a loud, clear voice as widower Praveen Halappanavar, who claims she made the Catholic remark, sat with his friend, a Galway-based consultant Dr CVR Prasad. She addressed the Irish Medical Council guidelines on abortion which refer to terminating a pregnancy if there is a risk to the mother’s life. She said her understanding was that they relate to conditions such as cancer, such as women getting radiotherapy, cervical care or a hysterectomy. 'My understanding is that this is a case where a woman is diagnosed with a life-threatening illness, usually unrelated to the pregnancy,' she said. Dr MacLoughlin asked if there was confusion over the interpretation of the guidelines. 'There’s no law to tell you what you what is permitted or not permitted,' she replied. Dr Astbury admitted there were system failures in her care at Galway University Hospital (pictured) Savita Halappanavar and Praveen Halappanavar at an event for the Indian community in Galway . Dr Astbury insisted that when she told . Mrs Halappanavar she could not abort the baby on the Tuesday, she used . the words: 'In this country it is not legal to terminate a pregnancy on . grounds of poor prognosis of the foetus.' The . doctor agreed that in other jurisdictions Mrs Halappanavar would have . been offered the option of a termination if the prognosis of her foetus . was poor. 'The law in Ireland does not permit termination even if there’s no prospect of viability,' she said. Dr Astbury saw Mrs Halappanavar at . 8.30am on the Wednesday during her morning round, about two hours after a . junior colleague raised concerns over her vitals and condition and . suspected sepsis chorioamnionitis, an infection of the foetal membrane. She . said the patient’s temperature and pulse rate had fallen in that time . and that she had not been told of an earlier entry on the medical notes . highlighting a sign of chorioamnionitis. Dr . Astbury said that had she known this she would then have started the . steps for a termination, instead of ordering tests to check for a urine . infection. 'A medical termination usually takes several hours, but I would have started it,' she said.","Ann Maria Burke admitted using the words to Savita Halappanavar .

Experts say engineers have had to be pulled from its Mac software group so the new version can be finished in time for a rumoured summer launch. It will be the first major overhaul of its software under British designer Sir Jonathan Ive, and is believed to look completely different with a cleaner, uncluttered design. Apple's Sir Jonathan Ive in May 2012. He is now overseeing a major overhaul of the firm's iOS software, which is believed to have hit delays. Sir Jonathan was given the responsibility the software earlier this year after the company fired Scott Forstall in a  move believed to be related to the firm's huge problems with its Maps app. 'What I've heard: iOS 7 is running behind, and engineers have been pulled from OS X 10.9 to work on it' said John Gruber of the Apple blog Daring Fireball. He also claimed engineers working on the project had been given special handsets. 'Word on the street is that iOS engineers with carry privileges all have some sort of polarizing filter on their iPhone displays, such that it greatly decreases viewing angles, thus making it difficult for observers to see the apparently rather significant system-wide UI overhaul.' Apple's next iPhone could go on sale in the summer alongside the new software, it has been claimed. Sources close to the electronics giant say the handset, expected to be a speed-boosted version of the current iPhone 5 with new software, will begin production within weeks and go on sale in the summer. This will break with Apple's traditional autumn unveiling of a new handset, and is likely to pave the way for a lower cost iPhone to be revealed later in the year. Customers queue up to purchase the iPhone 5 smartphone at the Apple flagship store on George street in Sydney, Australia. The firm is believed to be preparing to unveil the next version in the summer. Apple's next two iPhones had already been designed before Steve Jobs died in October 2011, it has been claimed. At a meeting with the San Francisco district attorney, George Gascón, who is keen to cut phone thefts in the region, Apple's liaison officer Michael Foulkes is reported by the San Francisco Examiner to have said the designs for the next two phones 'preceded Tim Cook [being chief executive]'.

'At the same time, Apple continues to work with its manufacturing partners in Asia on a less expensive iPhone that could be launched as soon as the second half of this year, these people said.' The report is in line with the expectations of company watchers and Wall Street analysts. The iPhone 5 costs around $600 in the US, and while Apple maintains older iPhones in production, even those aren't cheap enough to compete effectively against low-end smartphones running Google Inc.'s Android software. Apple does not comment on future products before its launch events. Earlier this year it was claimed the iPhone 5S will be revealed in April and go on sale in August.

The Scottish Government has joined the fight against the illegal trade in rhinoceros horn by setting up a DNA database which will help trace the origin of stolen horns seized by police. Rhinoceros horn now fetches more than its weight in gold on the black market and it is not just animals living in the wild that are being targeted by criminals.

More than 50 thefts were reported from museums, galleries and auction houses in Europe in 2011. More than 50 thefts were reported from museums, galleries and auction houses in Europe in 2011. Scientists at Sasa (Science and Advice for Scottish Agriculture) are to send out sampling kits to museums and zoos across the UK to create Scotland's first rhino horn database. A study has shown that DNA profiles can be produced from museum horns that are more than 100 years old. The aim of the Defra-funded project is to protect exhibits and also live rhinos in zoos from criminal gangs who steal and sell rhino horn for thousands of pounds. Environment Minister Paul Wheelhouse said: 'The illegal trade in rhino horn has become not only a threat to these magnificent but sadly very rare animals in the wild, but also to our museums and zoos. 'The work at Sasa will help the police to crack down on the criminals who are beneath contempt and who, seemingly, will stop at nothing to exploit these endangered animals for profit.' Lucy Webster, who is co-ordinating the project at Sasa, said: 'While we hope that the horns in museums and zoos in the UK are safe, where large sums of money are involved there will always be some pressure from criminals who seek to exploit these resources. More than 50 thefts of rhinoceros horns were reported from museums, galleries and auction houses in Europe in 2011 . 'This database will store a unique DNA profile for each sample submitted. If any are subsequently stolen, these profiles will allow horns recovered to be traced back to their place of origin - helping investigators disentangle the supply chain of this illegal trade.' The move was welcomed by WWF Scotland director Lang Banks. He said: 'The illegal trade in rhino horn is now being co-ordinated by sophisticated international criminal syndicates, with big profits to be made by supplying wealthy clients. 'As international efforts are stepped up to protect living rhinos in their natural habitats, we've seen a jump in thefts of horns from private collections in Europe. 'Taking steps to database known rhino horn in Scotland and the rest of the UK will help to close yet another door on those attempting to profit from the illegal trade in endangered wildlife.'","Rhinoceros horn now fetches more than its weight in gold on the black market .

A spokesman for the Metropolitan Police said: 'We are . conducting routine enquiries in connection with an historic . investigation.' Detectives have long suspected he was murdered by a paedophile gang linked to a youth club which met near the church in the 1980s. They believe the teenager had discovered what was going on in a shed and had tried to stop the sexual crimes - causing others to want to kill him. Part of the churchyard, which is less than a mile from where Lee was last seen, has been sealed off. A police forensic team is using ground-penetrating radar in the area being searched. The Metropolitan Police said the dig was 'routine activity' and part of its inquiry into the teenager's disappearance. Officers began a search of the area near a shed, an outbuilding at the church, and the graveyard last year and had planned to resume the operation in April.

Facebook has unveiled a new app to turn any phone running Google's Android software into a 'Facebook phone'. The free software can be downloaded to handsets and take over its homescreen and menu system to show updates without having to launch a Facebook app. It will also be preloaded on new handsets, including a HTC handset called First which will be the first 'Facebook phone', and goes on sale on April 12th, when the free app will also launch. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg unveiling the Facebook 'home' app at the firm's Silicon Valley HQ . The new Facebook Home app takes over the menu system of an Android phone. Users can chat and see emails (left) and also easily post pictures via Instagram and comment without having to load a Facebook app. 'Today we're finally here to talk about the Facebook phone,' said Mark Zuckerberg at the announcement at the firm's Silicon Valley HQ. 'Or more accurately, we are going to talk about how you can turn your Android phone into a great social phone.' 'We are not building a phone and we are not building an operating system but we are are building something that is a whole lot deeper than an ordinary app. 'We wanted to flip things around so our phones were designed around people and not apps. 'How many times have you pulled out a phone and looked into different apps to see what's going on. 'We want to bring all this content to the front.' Zuckerberg says users can have an experience on Android phones that they can't have on other platforms. 'We're really proud of Home, we think this is the best version of Facebook there is.' 'Home' comes amid rapid growth in the number of people who access . Facebook from phones and tablet computers. Of its 1.06billion monthly . users, 680million log in to Facebook using a mobile gadget. The new product is a family of apps designed around people's Facebook connections. Pictures from your Facebook news feed would take up the entire display screen. Zuckerberg said users will be seeing the world through people rather than apps. He gave an example of standing in line at a shop and looking down at the phone to see photos of friends and family. The new app completely overhauls Facebook's chat system, left, while a new lockscreen, right, completely replaces the normal Android menu system. The HTC first will be the first handset to launch with Facebook's software preloaded on it . 'It'll be possible to flip through the items. 'If there's something you like, just double tap on it to ""like"" it,' he said. The home app also includes a radical overhaul of the firm's chat app designed to take on increasing competition from apps such as Snapchat. The new 'Chatheads' show a friend's head in the corner of the screen whenever a new message appears. 'They're a way you can chat to your friends no matter what you're doing,' said Facebook's Adam Mosseri. The new app will be available on all recent Android devices, including tablets, the firm said. The software replaces the normal phone menu with a version designed by Facebook . The new Facebook homescreen, which lets users access Facebook, chat with friends or access their apps . Experts said the move was an interesting one - but warn it could simply be a way to show users more ads.. Jan Dawson, chief telecoms analyst at Ovum, said: 'Any broadening of Facebook's appeal on mobile devices would have to be broad-based, and the Android launcher approach allows it to target a huge installed base of hundreds of millions of Android users, which will be a large chunk of Facebook's total user base of more than a billion people. 'To users, the sell here will be making it easier to share information, photos and so on with friends. 'But to Facebook, this is about becoming more deeply embedded in the operating system on mobile devices, and creating a broader platform. 'Since Facebook doesn't make an operating system for mobile devices, this is the next best thing. It will allow Facebook to track more of a user's behaviour on devices, and present more opportunities to serve up advertising, which is Facebook's main business model. 'And that presents the biggest obstacle to success for this experiment: Facebook's objectives and users are once again in conflict. 'Users don't want more advertising or tracking, and Facebook wants to do more of both.' The new Facebook 'home' app, which turns Android handsets into a Facebook phone . 'What Facebook wants is to put itself at the front of the Android user experience for as many Facebook users as possible and make Facebook more elemental to their customers' experience,' said Forrester analyst Charles Golvin. The new Home service won't be available on Apple's iPhone and iPad devices. Apple's iOS and Mac operating systems include features that integrate Facebook's services, but Zuckerberg says doing something like Home would require a closer partnership. Apple had no immediate comment. The deeper mobile integration will likely help Facebook to attract more mobile advertisers. Though mobile ads were a big concern for Facebook's investors even before the company's initial public offering last May, some of the worry has subsided as the company muscles its way into the market. Last year, Facebook began showing ads to its mobile audience by shoehorning corporate-sponsored content into users' news feeds, which also include updates from friends and brands they follow. Facebook now faces the challenge of showing people mobile ads without annoying or alienating them. The mobile advertising market is growing quickly, thanks in large part to Facebook and Twitter, which also entered the space in 2012. Research firm eMarketer expects U.S. mobile ad spending to grow 77 per cent this year to $7.29billion, from $4.11billion last year. EMarketer said Wednesday that it expects Facebook Inc. to reap $965million in U.S. mobile ad revenue in 2013. That's about 2.5 times the $391million in 2012, the first year that Facebook started showing mobile ads. Clark Fredricksen, vice president at eMarketer, says: 'There are some clear reasons why a deeper integration with mobile operating systems and handsets make sense for Facebook. 'At the end of the day, the more deeply Facebook can engage consumers, no matter what device or operating system or handset,' the better. Facebook's stock rose 80 cents, or 3.1 per cent, to $27.05 in afternoon trading following the announcement. It is still 23 per cent below its initial public offering price of $35.","Facebook Home takes over phone's homescreen and menus .

Taken between Aug. 12, 2012, and Jan. 13, 2013, they show the used parachute shifting its . shape on the surface and it is blown about by winds. Scroll down for video . The astonishing series of images reveal Curiosity's parachute fluttering in the wind . The parachute is the largest one of . its kind ever constructed, and measures 65 feet in diameter. The parachute’s . suspension lines were made from Technora, with a fiber similar to . Kevlar. The color is a creamy yellow, which is why they are not visible . in the images such as those in the Phoenix lander descent image which . were white. The photos from NASA's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter show how the parachute that helped NASA's Curiosity rover land on Mars last summer has subsequently changed its shape on the ground. The images were obtained by the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment (HiRISE) camera on Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Seven images taken by HiRISE between Aug. 12, 2012, and Jan. 13, 2013, show the used parachute shifting its shape at least twice in response to wind. Sometime between September 8, 2012 . and November 30, 2012, there was a major change in which the parachute . extension to the southeast (lower right) was moved inward, so the . parachute covers a smaller area. In the same time interval some of the . dark ejecta around the backshell brightened, perhaps from deposition of . airborne dust. Another change happened between . December 16, 2012 and January 13, 2013, when the parachute shifted a bit . to the southeast. This type of motion may kick off dust and keep . parachutes on the surface bright, and researchers say it may help to help explain why the parachute from . Viking 1 (landed in 1976) remains detectable. Researchers have used HiRISE to study many types of changes on Mars. The Curiosity parachute is the largest one of its kind ever constructed, coming in about 65 feet in diameter (you can see a scale here) The gap between the white and orange-hued sections prevented the chute from becoming torn during the descent phase. Its first image of Curiosity's parachute, above, caught the spacecraft suspended from the chute during descent through the Martian atmosphere. After . entering the Martian atmosphere at 13,200mph, the capsule containing . Curiosity slowed by friction and then a supersonic parachute. An 'upper stage' resembling a flying bedstead was then be deployed, firing retro rockets to brake its descent. As . it hovers over the landing site, the upper stage transformed itself . into a 'sky crane' and lowered Curiosity to the surface on the end of a . tether. The contraption then broke away, and deliberately crashed. The latest pictures were captured by the HiRise craft, the High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. The 65 kg (143 lb), $40 million instrument was built under the direction of the University of Arizona's Lunar and Planetary Laboratory by Ball Aerospace & Technologies Corp. Curiosity descending to the red planet was captured by the same spacecraft that has now seen its parachute shift on the surface . It consists of a 0.5 m (19.7 in) aperture reflecting telescope, the largest so far of any deep space mission, which allows it to take pictures of Mars with resolutions of 0.3 m/pixel (about 1 foot), resolving objects below a meter across.

It's the Martian version of spring break: Curiosity and Opportunity, along with their spacecraft friends circling overhead, will take it easy this month because of the sun's interference. For much of April, the sun blocks the line of sight between Earth and Mars. This celestial alignment — called a Mars solar conjunction — makes it difficult for engineers to send instructions or hear from the flotilla in orbit and on the surface. Such communication blackouts occur every two years when the red planet disappears behind the sun. No new commands are sent since flares and charged particles spewing from the sun can scramble transmission signals and put spacecraft in danger. Mission teams prepared by uploading weeks of scaled-back activities beforehand. 'They're on their own,' said Rich Zurek, chief Mars scientist at the NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The rovers are banned from driving. Instead, they take a staycation and study their surroundings. The orbiting Mars Odyssey and Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter continue to listen for the rovers and make their own observations, but for the most part will transmit data once Mars is in view again. Opportunity, Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and the European Space Agency's Mars Express have survived previous bouts of restricted communications. It's the first for Curiosity, which landed last year near the Martian equator to hunt for the chemical building blocks of life. The positions of the sun, Earth and Mars, at left. Radio communications between Earth and Mars are limited during this planetary alignment, which occurs in April. Spacecraft in orbit around Mars and on the surface will not receive new commands during this period. Next month, Mars will be passing almost directly behind the sun, from Earth's perspective. The sun can easily disrupt radio transmissions between the two planets during that near-alignment. Beginning Thursday and through May 1, Curiosity can only check the weather every hour, measure radiation and look for signs of water below the desert-like surface. The limited chores are a departure for the active six-wheeler, which is used to driving, drilling and zapping its laser at rocks. Before the sun got in the way, Curiosity made its biggest discovery yet: From a drilled piece of rock, it determined that its crater landing site was habitable billions of years ago, possessing some of the basic ingredients necessary to support tiny microbes. Scientists must wait until next month to drill into another rock and start the long-delayed trek to a mountain where Curiosity will search for the elusive organic molecules that are fundamental to life as we know it. The road trip was supposed to have started last year, but longer-than-expected science experiments put Curiosity behind schedule. Odyssey, circling Mars since 2001, has experienced half a dozen blackout episodes with no problem. This time, it will try something new. There are plans to radio Earth every day even if calls are dropped, mostly to keep engineers updated on Curiosity's health. The rover is also programmed to send daily beeps to ground controllers. By contrast, the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter will record and store information onboard its computers and beam it back after the hiatus. Opportunity, which parked itself in a clay-rich spot, will use the down time to study a rock and track the amount of dust in the sky. With Mars missions on autopilot, many scientists and engineers planned to take vacation while a small crew remains on duty. 'We've been through this before,' Zurek said. 'We're not expecting to have any problems during this period. Let's hope it stays that way.' How Curiosity got to Mars .","Images taken over several months by the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .

In court: Tabitha Gentry appeared today defending herself against charges of burglary, theft and trespass . A mother-of-six, who 'squatted' an east Memphis mansion for a week, told a court that she has a 'legal claim' to the property because she is heir via an anti-government sect. Tabitha Gentry, who calls herself Abka Re Bey, appeared at the General Sessions Criminal Court Wednesday to present her own case against charges of burglary, theft and trespass, the Commercial Appeal reported. The 33-year-old moved into the sprawling mansion in the Shady Grove neighborhood of Memphis last month with her six children aged between 11 years and 14 months. In court she said she was an heir to the $3 million four-acre property as a citizen of the Moorish American National Republic. The group does not recognize state or federal law. 'I have a lawful, legal claim,' Gentry told the courtroom according to the Appeal. 'I am the heir to this massive estate. They locked me up unlawfully.' Gentry filed . papers with Shelby County Register’s Office claiming her right to the . property before moving in. General Sessions Criminal Court Judge Loyce Lambert-Ryan complimented Gentry on her questioning of law enforcement officers and a representative of the bank that owns the 10,000-square-foot mansion. But then explained that her interpretation does not fit with the law. Defense: Tabitha Gentry represented herself in court today . Expensive: This is the property Gentry moved into last month. In 2006, the residence, pictured in real estate photos, was bought for $3.9 million by Richard and April Rice . Repossessed: Renasant Bank assumed ownership in August 2011 and the home had been empty for more than a year . 'Even though you felt you had done . all that was required and sent notices to the bank that you were taking . the property, the laws of the state of Tennessee do not recognize those . beliefs,' said the judge. 'You’re not an heir apparent because you claim to be a Moorish National.' The case was sent to grand jury but Gentry's bond was lowered to $50,000 from $2 million. Last month the property's front gate . was chained shut and five signs were put up saying 'Keep Out/Private . Property' alongside a flag saying 'Moorish American National Republic'. Family members of Gentry, originally . from the Memphis suburb of Horn Lake, spoke out following her arrest . blaming her involvement in the radical movement. They said she was at one time an honor student and high school basketball player with a promising future. ‘Very smart. They said she was on the dean's list at school,’ cousin Trenisha Gentry told Myfoxmemphis. ‘She never went without making the honor roll or principal's list.’ They claim she fell in love with a member of the movement and soon changed her appearance and adopted a new name. Her children have since been placed of the care of family members and the social services. The home is owned by Renesant Bank after . going into foreclosure in August 2011. Claim: A note was placed on the gate of the property claiming ownership . Power: The home still had utilities but no furniture according to neighbors . At the time neighbors were outraged that the squatters had bedded into their exclusive neighborhood. 'Well, I'm stunned really,' David Peck told WMCTV.com. 'I know the two former owners. And I knew the house was on the market, but I've never heard of anything like this.' Another neighbor, Vallie Jo Bell, said: 'We were just really surprised. I hope they'll get out and maybe find another place to live.' Gentry was today also indicted on aggravated assault charges that were dismissed by a lower court when she failed to appear last year. Police said she hit two officers with her car on October 9. In contention: Gentry still claims she has a legitimate claim to the property .

John Walker Lindh believes that he and other Muslim inmates at a high-security Indiana prison unit should be allowed to pray together five times a day . Lawyers for American Taliban fighter John Walker Lindh asked a federal judge on Wednesday to find the Federal Bureau of Prisons in contempt for not allowing Muslim inmates in a high-security Indiana prison unit to pray together five times a day, as required by their faith. The prisons agency has said inmates of all religions housed in the Terre Haute federal prison's Communications Management Unit have been allowed to pray together three times daily after a federal judge ruled in Lindh's favor in a lawsuit seeking the prayers. The American Civil Liberties Union of Indiana argues in its contempt motion filed in U.S. District Court in Indianapolis that three times a day isn't what Judge Jane Magnus-Stinson's Jan. 11 ruling required. Magnus-Stinson said Lindh, 32, sincerely believes Islam mandates Muslims pray together five times a day and federal law requires the prison to accommodate his beliefs. The motion also said prayer times set by the prison make only two daily prayers possible at some times during the year or make prayers impossible to perform at proper times. The prison has ‘knowingly and intentionally established a procedure and schedule for prayers that prevents John Lindh and other Muslim prisoners within the CMU from engaging in congregate prayer during all times that they are released from their cells,’ the motion said. Ken Falk, legal director of the ACLU of Indiana, said it was ‘immensely disappointing that the federal government feels it can avoid complying with the judge's order.’ Bureau of Prisons spokesman Christ Burke said the agency would have no comment on the motion because the legal action was pending. John Walker Lindh is housed in the Terre Haute federal prison's Communications Management Unit in Indiana . Lindh is serving a 20-year sentence for supplying services to the now-defunct Taliban government of Afghanistan . Lindh's father, Frank Lindh, told The Associated Press that he had told his son to be patient. ‘It's regrettable it had to go that far. The judge's order was very clear,’ he said in a phone interview from Washington, D.C. Those housed in Lindh's unit are considered extreme security risks and their interactions are closely monitored. Until last month, inmates housed in the unit were only allowed to pray together once per week or during Ramadan or on other significant religious holidays. At other times, inmates had to pray alone in their cells and hope to hear each other through the walls. Magnus-Stinson found the policy violated a 1993 law banning the government from curtailing religious speech without showing a compelling interest, and the government chose not to appeal her ruling. Prison officials said during the trial on Lindh's lawsuit that allowing group prayers every day would pose a security risk and that inmates had used religion as cover for gang-like activity, but the judge dismissed those arguments as insubstantial. The government chose not to appeal the ruling. The Muslim faith requires followers to pray together five times a day . The lawsuit originally was filed in . 2009 by two Muslim inmates in the unit. Lindh joined the lawsuit in . 2010, and the case drew far more attention. The other plaintiffs dropped out as they were released from prison or transferred to other units. Lindh had been charged with . conspiring to kill Americans and support terrorists, but those charges . were dropped in a plea agreement.

'A good knowledge of anatomy is essential to create the artificial body or 'form'. Artistic talent is needed to finish the specimen and set up a natural display. 'A good taxidermist is a sculptor, artist and naturalist rolled into one.' Toulouse's museum is billing their exhibition, which will feature bears from across the world, as the event of the year.

The married teacher accused of raping a 14-year-old student over a seven-month period was friends with countless teen boys and girls on Facebook, it emerged today. Sixth-grade English teacher Daniel Reilly, 36, from Queens, New York, is accused of having sex repeatedly with the student at his home while his wife and new baby daughter were out. On his Facebook page - which has since been taken down - he had 40 visible friends, the majority of whom were young students from local high schools. The ex-marine had his victim use a code name in her cellphone to keep the illegal hookups a secret, according to the Queens district attorney. English teacher Daniel Reilly, 36, is alleged to have had an eight-month affair with a 14-year-old former pupil . His lawyer wife, Annemarie, put up his $30,000 bail Tuesday, said Reilly’s lawyer, Eric Franz, and is 'supporting her husband'. If convicted, he faces seven years in prison. Court documents suggested that their most recent tryst took just days before Reilly was arrested at Intermediate School 237 in Flushing after his alleged victim's mother alerted the school. The prosecutor told Queens Criminal Court that the alleged relationship began last year after he pursued the girl, who originally just wanted to be friends with him. He is alleged to have begun texting her last August before inviting her to his apartment when his wife and 11-month-old daughter were out. Reilly, who faces statutory rape charges, is said to have given the girl a code-name to use so that her parents would not discover the affair, while he used another code for her so his wife Annemarie would remain in the dark. Intermediate School 237 in Flushing, New York,where Daniel Reilly was a sixth-grade English teacher . The prosecutor said: 'The defendant planned on keeping the affair secret', according to a report in the New York Daily News. It said the relationship was only discovered when the victim's sister discovered texts from Reilly on her sister's cellphone. She told her parents, who alerted IS237, where the girl is no longer a student, and they hauled him out of class while they rang police. The $61,000-a-year teacher, who served as a sergeant in the Marines between 1996-2000, is said to have no history of disciplinary problems since he began working as a teacher in 2007. Queens DA Richard Brown told the New York Post: 'This case is particularly disturbing.  Schools should be safe havens for children. 'Instead, this defendant is accused of sexually preying upon one of his former students and rendezvousing with her at his residence.' Schools chancellor Dennis Walcott said: 'As I've said before, this is totally unacceptable.  We have no tolerance for that. 'Keep your hands off our students.' Reilly is said to have been honorably discharged from the Marines in 2000, and is a popular teacher at the school where he has taught for six years. He is charged with second-degree rape, criminal sexual acts, and endangering the welfare of a child, and is due back in court on May 6.  A victim order has been issued on behalf of the teen.","Daniel Reilly, 36, faces rape, child endangerment, and sexual abuse charges .

Quentin Tarantino's spaghetti western Django Unchained was pulled from Chinese cinemas on its opening day because one scene contains full-frontal male nudity, it was claimed today. Cinemas throughout the country were ordered to suspend the film, which has been a blockbuster in the U.S. and the UK, even after it was given the all-clear by communist censors. Employees at two outlets in Beijing said an order by the importer, China Film Group, cited an unspecified 'technical' problem. However, there were some suggestions on Chinese social media sites that the postponement was related to a nude scene featuring the film's lead actor, Jamie Foxx, it was reported by The Guardian. The sudden decision comes despite weeks of promotion for the violent slave-revenge saga in China, which is now the world's second biggest movie market. Slave revenge saga: Jamie Foxx plays the title role in Django Unchained, which has been pulled from Chinese cinemas on its opening day, despite weeks of promotion for the film in the country . Too much for China: The film was apparently pulled because of this scene featuring a naked Jamie Foxx being hung upside down while being tortured . The employees would not give their full names and calls to China Film Group and the government's film regulatory agency were unanswered, the Associated Press reported. Some violent scenes had already been cut from Django Unchained to get it passed China's rigorous censorship. Violence, sex and politically edgy content rarely make it onto Chinese cinema screens. Tarantino himself was said to be overseeing the process of dulling the colour of blood splatters and lowering their frequency, according to the Guardian. Director Quentin Tarantino in his cameo: The decision to pull the film comes even after Tarantino oversaw a process of toning down some of Django's more violent scenes to get it past China's strict censorship . A spokesman for the Chinese branch of . Sony, the film's distributor, told the Southern Metropolis Daily: 'These . slight adjustments will not affect the basic quality of the film – such . as tuning the blood to a darker colour, or lowering the height of the . splatter of blood. 'Quentin . knew how to adjust that, and it's necessary that he is the one to do . it. You can give him suggestions, but it must be him who does [the . tuning].' With such an exacting system in place the suspension of a film's Chinese première date is unusual. It's not the first Django Unchained première to be postponed. The film, which stars Jamie Foxx in the title role, is so violent that the production company behind it decided to cancel its Hollywood premiere in December out of respect to the victims of the Sandy Hook school massacre.","Gore and violence had been toned down for the Chinese market .

French President Francois Hollande has called for the 'eradication' of tax havens in a bid to fight fraud and corruption. He was speaking after presenting a draft law aimed at 'moralising' French public life - a response to the tax scandal that has shaken his presidency. Mr Hollande told French banks that they must declare any foreign subsidiaries each year as he presented a draft law drawn up in response to the country's recent tax scandal. The president said that a new specialised agency would be set up as part of the new law which is part of a drive to increase transparency. Outspoken: French President Francois Hollande has called for all tax havens to be 'eradicated' as part of a crackdown on corruption . From next Monday, all ministers most disclose their assets to the government, announced the French Socialist government earlier. Mr Hollande told a press conference today: 'I won't hesitate to consider as a tax haven any country that refuses to co-operate fully with France.' He added that banks will have to explain the nature of their business publicly. He said: 'In other words it won't be possible for a bank to hide transactions carried out in a tax haven.' Probe: French ministers have to declare assets after former French Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac admitted having offshore assets . The proposed strict new rules follow a confession by Jerome Cahuzac that he 'lied to the president' about dodging tax has sent shockwaves through the deeply unpopular socialist administration. The former budget minister admitted last week that he had hidden around 600,000 euros (£509,000) in a Swiss bank account. His admission saw him expelled from the Socialist Party. The scandal has rocked Mr Hollande's presidency. Critics have accused Hollande and his ministers of knowing about and covering up Cahuzac's tax dodging and of mismanagement for having believed his denials. A poll this week also revealed three out of five French people want a government re-shuffle - a move that President Hollande has rejected. The French President had pledged to crack down on tax dodging but the Cahuzac scandal has seriously damaged his popularity.","Mr Hollande said that all French banks must declare foreign subsidiaries .

A man deliberately cut his arms with saws in the aisles of a Home Depot store in suburban Los Angeles Wednesday, creating a gruesome scene in front of several horrified customers. The man was in the store's tool section and went unnoticed until he began grabbing several small saws, including one meant to cut sheet rock, and started using them on his arms. ‘He cut both arms with hand saws down to the bone,’ said West Covina police Cpl. Rudy Lopez. Bloody scene: A man in his 40s walked into this Home Depot store on Azusa Avenue in West Covina and proceeded to cut his arms with hand saws . Officers received several 911 calls and arrived to find the man lying unconscious in the aisle in a pool of blood. An off-duty paramedic from the Pasadena Fire Department had been shopping nearby, and with help from police collected twine and rags from store shelves and put makeshift tourniquets on both arms, a move Lopez said probably saved the man's life. Police received a 911 call at around 12.20pm from the home improvement store on Azusa Avenue in West Covina about a man who has injured himself. Witnesses say the man picked up several hand saws and started cutting his arms. 'He just began sawing away,' Lopez told KTLA. 'He was pretty much intent on doing what he did.' The off-duty paramedic and officers who arrived on the scene helped stop the heavy blood flow. Nightmare scenario: The victim (not pictured) grabbed several small saws and used them to cut his limbs to the bone before collapsing in a pool of blood . The man was taken to Queen of the Valley Medical Center where he underwent surgery. As of Wednesday night, no information has been released on his condition. The unnamed man, who looked to be in his 40s, was carrying no identification, has been unable to answer questions, and was not heard saying anything in the store, so police do not know why he cut himself, Lopez said. Police interviewed about five people who said they saw what happened, and Lopez said there were likely many more who quickly left the disturbing scene. ‘It was pretty graphic,’ he said. The West Covina home improvement business remained closed for the rest of the day after the gruesome incident.","Unnamed man in his 40s walked into Home Depot in West Covina, Calif., and started cutting his arms with hand saws .

Cyprus has been warned it must sell its excess gold reserves to raise 400million euros needed to help finance its EU bailout. The stark assessment by the European Commission will come as another huge blow for the tiny country as it battles to save its stricken economy. One of the euro zone's smallest economies, Cyprus has already been forced to wind down one of its largest banks and slapped losses on uninsured deposits in order to qualify for a 10billion euro lifeline from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund. Protests: There have been protests held across the country as fears rise over the impact of the crisis. Here employees of Cyprus Airways (pictured) demonstrate against the company's restructuring plans . Desperate: Widespread protests have been held across Cyprus as fears rise over the impact of the crisis. The country has now been told it must sell its excess gold reserves to help fund its bailout . Worried: Cypriots have queued to withdraw money from the country's banks since the financial crisis hit - including at this Bank of Cyprus branch in Nicosia . The European Commission's draft assessment set . out plans for the sale of some 10 tonnes of gold, the biggest euro zone bullion . sale in four years. The assessment also said that Cyprus would raise 10.6 billion euros from the winding down of Laiki Bank and the losses imposed on junior bondholders and the deposit-for-equity swap for uninsured deposits in the Bank of Cyprus. Nicosia would get a further 600 million euros over three years from higher corporate income taxes and a rise in the capital gains tax rate. Fears: Depositors waiting to withdraw money from a branch of Laiki Bank in Nicosia, last month. Laiki, also known as Cyprus Popular Bank, was wound up as part of the bailout deal agreed with the EU . Of the total Cypriot financing needs of . 23 billion euros between the second quarter of 2013 and the first . quarter of 2016, the euro zone bailout fund will provide nine billion . euros, the International Monetary Fund one billion euros and Cyprus itself . will generate 13 billion euros, the assessment said. Cyprus's total bullion reserves stood at 13.9 tonnes at the end of February, according to data from the World Gold Council. The analysis from the EU and IMF predicts the Cypriot economy will contract by 8.7 percent this year, following the bailout designed to put Cyprus back on a stable financial footing. It also shows that the economy will go on contracting through 2014, returning to marginal growth of 1.1 per cent in 2015. At the same time, debt as a proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) will peak at 126 percent, before falling to 104 per cent in 2020, the debt sustainability report shows. The analysis forecasts the budget deficit to be six per cent of GDP this year, 7.9 per cent next year, 5.7 per cent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016. The European Stability Mechanism (ESM), the euro zone bailout fund, also said in a proposal that the maximum average maturity of euro zone bailout loans to Cyprus will be 15 years and the longest maturity will be 20 years. Cyprus will be charged a 10-basis-point margin above financing costs for the loans, plus a 50 basis point up-front fee for every disbursement, said the proposal, which will be discussed on Friday by finance ministers of European Union countries at a meeting in Dublin. The ESM document bears the date of April 23, 2013, indicating that this will be the date when the euro zone is likely to formally sign the bailout agreement with Cyprus.","Stark assessment by European .

"By . Associated Press and Helen Pow . PUBLISHED: . 19:12 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 19:30 EST, 11 April 2013 . Desperate man: Lauren Brown, 55, a former consultant for IBM, has been identified as the slain suspect who held four firefighters hostage for hours in his suburban Atlanta home . A gunman who lured firefighters to his Georgia home with an emergency call, then held four of them hostage for hours before being shot to death was identified Thursday as a down-on-his-luck IBM consultant. Lauren Brown's life apparently reached a crisis this spring. With his power, cable and other utilities cut off because of nonpayment, the 55-year-old had half a dozen guns in his house and spent weeks planning the kidnapping, targeting firefighters rather than police Wednesday so he wouldn't be shot, authorities said. The specific reasons he chose to lash out aren't known, but Brown had separated from his wife years earlier, though he still lived across the street from her, her new husband and his two children, according to neighbors and people who knew the family. Brown had worked as a consultant for IBM in 1999, but described himself as disabled when he filed for bankruptcy protection three years later, according to court documents. He said he owed more than $100,000 to the Home Depot, banks and credit card companies. The records suggest that Brown was taping into his retirement savings to make ends meet. A series of tax liens had been placed on his home, which slipped into foreclosure in recent months. He was arrested and booked into the Gwinnett County jail in 2010 after he failed to appear in court on a charge of striking an unmanned vehicle. Brown called 911 Wednesday and said he was suffering from chest pains, and five Gwinnett County firefighters arrived at 3.48pm, believing it was a routine call, said Police Chief Charles Walters. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Aftermath: Gwinnett County Police Department Crime Scene Investigator Ashley Pizzuto, left, and Detective Cole Crosby outside's Brown's home damaged in the raid . Sad outcome: Yellow crime scene tape surrounds Lauren Brown's red-brick home that become the scene of a hostage situation which resulted in his death . Brown was lying in bed and appeared to be suffering from a condition that left him unable to move. But when they approached the bed to help him, he pulled out a handgun, Walters said. He let one of the firefighters go to move the vehicles from the front of his house but kept the other four. That began a three-and-a-half hour standoff. At about 7.30pm, police were convinced that even if they met Brown's demands, he had no intention of releasing his hostages, Walters said. Over the course of several hours of negotiations, police said Brown demanded that officers bring him wood and tools so he could board up his windows. He also had requested items from a fast food seafood restaurant for himself and his hostages, and a SWAT officer carrying the food approached the house in Suwannee, about 35 miles northeast of Atlanta. Other SWAT members set off a stun blast to distract Brown and stormed the house. Brown opened fire on the first officer as he entered the bedroom. The man was hit in the left forearm by one of the shots, but managed to return fire, killing Brown. Before Brown fired, police told him to drop his weapon, Walters said. Exposed wooden beams could be seen through a gaping hole in the side of the house Thursday and debris littered the yard. Public records indicate the red brick house with white siding is in foreclosure and has been bank-owned since mid-November. Next to Brown's home, another brick house with tan siding appeared to have even more damage. A large area of the side was missing, again with wooden beams and insulation exposed. A Gwinnett County Police Department crime scene investigator carries a handful of spent stun grenades that were used during the raid on Brown's house to end the standoff . Jasmin Gutierez, 12, was at home with her family in that house Wednesday afternoon. They huddled in the master bedroom at the other end of the house. ‘We started, like, at least trying to get in a group hug to save ourselves because we got scared,’ she said. ‘I mean there was a lot of people, like the SWAT teams and the police.’ After a while, they heard a loud bang and then they heard shooting and black smoke started to fill their home and police knocked on the door to make sure they were all right. After the hostage-taking was reported, dozens of police and rescue vehicles surrounded the home and a negotiator was keeping in touch with the gunman, police said. The situation remained tense until the blast rocked the neighborhood of mostly two-story homes and well-kept lawns. ‘The explosion you heard was used to distract the suspect, to get into the house and take care of business,’ Gwinnett County Police Cpl. Edwin Ritter said in a news conference minutes after the ordeal ended. He said the situation had gotten to the point where authorities believed the lives of the hostages were in ‘immediate danger.’ ‘It's an unfortunate circumstance we did not want to end this way,’ Ritter said. ‘But with the decisions this guy was making, this was his demise.’ Firefighters were able to use their radios to let the dispatch center know what was going on and that's how negotiators communicated with Brown initially, Walters said. Once they got his cell phone service turned back on, they were able to speak to him by phone. Fire officials did not believe there was any danger in responding to the initial call that seemed routine and dispatched the usual one engine and one ambulance to the house. Operation: At about 7:30 p.m an explosion shook the area and a SWAT team entered the home, shooting dead the suspect . All over: A group of people huddle together after an explosion and gunshots were heard near the scene where a man was holding four firefighters hostage . 'The explosion you heard was used to distract the suspect, to get into the house and take care of business,' Ritter said in a news conference minutes after the resolution. He said the situation had gotten to the point where authorities believed the lives of the hostages were in 'immediate danger.' 'It's an unfortunate circumstance we . did not want this to end this way,' Ritter said. 'But with the decisions . this guy was making, this was his demise.' A SWAT officer was shot in the hand or arm as the team entered the residence but he is expected to be fine. NBC News reported that police had made several visits to Brown’s home in the past, but never for any serious criminal activity. Brown’s next-door neighbor, Ozzie Greco, told WSB-TV that the former IBM consultant was a nice man but had recently run into personal and financial problems which ended up taking a heavy toll on his mental health. 'He was very sick in the mind,' Greco said. The neighbor added that as recently as two weeks ago, he offered Brown help, but the man declined. When the first hostage was released from Brown’s home Wednesday evening before gunfire erupted, Greco stepped outside his home and saw the 55-year-old, who told him to go back inside. ‘It's sad, because I remember him as a good person,’ said another neighbor Claudia Bayoma. This was the second time in recent months that firefighters have been targeted. On . December 24, a man in upstate New York set his house ablaze and shot . and killed two firefighters as they arrived, then himself. Two other . firefighters and a police officer were wounded. The gunman had originally taken five men hostage just before 4pm . but one firefighter was released to move a fire truck, according to . authorities.

Fashion giant Vogue has signed a landmark 10 point code over the treatment of models on shoots and in shows. Equity, the modelling union has reached an agreement with British Vogue on the code of conduct to be followed to try and improve the working environment of models. Models must be given time to eat on shoots and informed consent on nudity according to the new code. British Vogue have signed on to observe a 10-point code over the treatment of models, aimed to improve conditions in the industry . Modelling may look glamorous but it can involve incredibly long days, with, in some cases no breaks for hours on end and mistreatment both at catwalk shows and shoots . Working days are also limited to 10 hours, with no more than five hours without a break. While these demands may seem basic, Equity reports that they are not followed in the industry today, with models being forced to work 20 hour days with no break, being ‘surprised’ with nudity in a shoot, and even being told off for pausing to eat or go to the toilet. The Model Code will stipulate whether or not nudity is involved in a shoot before a model agrees to it, and ensure they are well treated while working. At present, a request to take off their clothes can be made during a shoot with no prior warning and a model can find it difficult to refuse or to fully consider whether they want to do it. Alexandra Shulman, Editor of British Vogue, who are the first publication to sign up to the Model Code . Model Sara Ziff, who founded Model Alliance, which offers support for those in the fashion industry, says this code is necessary. Speaking to the Guardian she says: 'To many, fashion seems fun and frivolous, and so it follows that modelling is seen more as a privilege than a job. This is wrong. The industry's glossy veneer camouflages the sometimes harsh realities of working as a model. ‘As someone who, on occasion, has worked 20-hour days and been admonished for so much as asking to use the toilet, the Equity and Vogue code represents a welcome change. ‘In an industry that relies on a labour force of minors who know they are highly replaceable and who are often too timid to say no to such demands, this important protection is long overdue.’ Equity say on their website that: ‘Models hired by British Vogue for editorial work will now get assurances on hours of work, breaks, food, transport, nudity and semi-nudity, temperature, changing rooms and prompt payment. ‘British Vogue readers can also be assured that all models in Vogue’s editorial are employed in line with the Code, and additionally that models under 16 years of age will not be used in photoshoots representing adult models.’ British and American Vogue have both already pledged not to use models under 16 or who appear to have an eating disorder. Equity hope that many other magazines and publications will now follow in Vogue’s footsteps and sign the code. Many models, like Kate Moss, begin their career at a very young age, and there is currently very little industry regulation over their treatment .","British Vogue has signed 10 point code over the treatment of models .

Murder-for-hire plot: Georgios Spyropoulos was arrested at the Tick Tock Diner that he manages in Clifton, NJ on conspiracy charges in a plot to have a hit man kill his uncle . The manager of a beloved New Jersey diner who felt he wasn't getting his fair share of the profits tried to have a hit man kill the co-owner of the eatery, who also happens to be his uncle, police said. Georgios Spyropoulos, the 45-year-old manager of the Tick Tock diner in Clifton, asked an undercover trooper posing as a hit man to kill Alexandros Sgourdos and to get rid of the body so it couldn't be found, authorities revealed Wednesday. The 57-year-old uncle also co-owns the other Tick Tock diner, a popular tourist destination across the street from Penn Station in Manhattan. Authorities said Spyropoulos resented the control his uncle exerted over the New Jersey restaurant, which was featured on Guy Fieri's Food Network show, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. They said he also felt his uncle was taking an unfair share of the profits. ‘I think it's an understatement to say they weren't close,’ Attorney General Jeffrey Chiesa told a news conference. Spyropoulos was being held on $1million bail on charges of conspiracy to commit murder, attempted murder and unlawful possession of a weapon. A message was left for his attorney. Chiesa said investigators believe Spyropoulos was motivated by greed and wanted to steal a large amount of cash that his uncle kept in a safe. Spyropoulos told the undercover officer, Chiesa said, to make sure to get the combination to his uncle's safe before killing him. Scroll down for video . Beloved eatery: Tic Tock, known for its motto, Eat Heavy, and its gravy and cheese-doused disco fries is considered a landmark to many people who live or travel along Route 3 in northern New Jersey . Spyropoulos suggested the undercover officer kidnap the uncle from his Clifton home and torture him until he gave up the combination, Chiesa said. The nephew provided the officer with a $3,000 down payment, a photo of his uncle, a map of his home and his daily schedule, including how he parked his car, authorities said. He also allegedly provided an unregistered handgun. ‘Once I leave here today, this is on,’ authorities say the undercover officer told the owner's nephew during an April 2 meeting. The total payment for the killing and disposal of the body was to be $20,000. The nephew wanted to make sure the body was not found so that it remained a missing person case, not a murder investigation, authorities said. If his uncle's wife posed any problem, Spyropoulos told the officer to kill her, too, authorities said.Authorities said a search of Spyropoulos' home turned up two semi-automatic handguns, a shotgun and what the attorney general's office called an ‘assault-style rifle.’ Chiesa said six cell phones and several thousand dollars in cash were recovered from the nephew's Mercedes Benz. Both Spyropoulos, who is originally from Athens, Greece, and his uncle, live in Clifton. Dining landmark: Alexandros Sgourdos also co-owns the other Tick Tock diner, a popular tourist destination across the street from Penn Station in Manhattan . Spyropoulos was taken into custody shortly before noon Tuesday at the diner. Chiesa said the manager appeared 'shocked' when officials slapped the handcuffs on him as he sat behind the cash register. ‘We are shocked, disappointed and dismayed as to the allegations,’ Joe Pojanowski, a lawyer for ABS Diner Inc., which owns the Tick Tock, told Bloomberg.com. ‘There were no signs of this coming.’ The 45-year-old suspect allegedly began plotting to have his relative murdered sometime in February. He mentioned his nefarious plan to a customer, who turned out to be a State Police informant. Based on the tip, authorities enlisted the help of a state trooper, who posed as a gun-for-hire. The three of them met on several occasions, during which the informant wore an electronic wire. The trio first got together at the TGI Friday's on Route 3 March 3, NorthJersey.com reported. During the meet-up, Spyropoulos allegedly told the two men he took to be hit men that he wanted them to kills his uncle and dispose of his body, believing that a missing persons case would go unnoticed. During a final gathering on April 2 held in the parking lot of a home improvement store, the 45-year-old diner manager allegedly handed the would-be assassin the down payment, an unregistered handgun and a map to his uncle's house. He also signed off on the potential murder of his aunt if she decided to intervene in the kidnapping and murder plot. ‘That’s how cold-blooded this guy was,’ Chiesa said. As seen on TV: The New Jersey restaurant was featured on the Food Network show Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives, in which Guy Fieri (far right) visits eateries and talks to owners and managers like Spyropoulos (center) Chiesa acknowledged that the case played to New Jersey archetypes involving nefarious plans hatched in diner booths. ‘This is sort of out of a script right in New Jersey, where you're going to meet at the Tick Tock diner to rub out your uncle to advance yourself,’ he said. ‘I understand that reaction of it, but from a law enforcement perspective, we're focused on the safety of the person who is the target.’ The classic chrome diner is a popular spot among fans attending Jets and Giants games at the stadium in the Meadowlands a few miles away. The eatery, known for its motto, Eat Heavy, and its gravy and cheese-doused disco fries is considered a landmark to many people who live or travel along Route 3 in northern New Jersey. Patrons lunching there Wednesday were shocked by the news. ‘It's your basic New Jersey family diner,’ said Bela Makula, a frequent customer who works nearby. ‘A standard, New Jersey diner that people try to emulate all over the country.’ Asked if he thought the case reflected poorly on the state, Makula replied without a pause: . ‘Everybody knows that New Jersey is full of criminals and killers.’","Georgios Spyropoulos, 45, is manager of popular Tic Tock diner in Clifton, NJ .

Thirteen people have been taken to hospital after they were exposed to a hazardous lab chemical at a Colorado university. Colorado Springs firefighters and hazmat crews rushed to Colorado College's Olin Hall at around 3 p.m. yesterday after reports that students and school staff had been exposed to titanium tetrachloride. According to student newspaper The Catalyst, the incident happened when a group of chemistry students were drilling into a pressurized container to obtain the substance. Exposed: Emergency personnel help a victim to the ambulance Wednesday, April 10, 2013, after a chemical spill in a science building at Colorado College in Colorado Springs, Colo. The building was evacuated and two people who were suffering severe respiratory issues in different parts of the hall had to be rescued by firefighters because they couldn't get out on their own. 'That was their first priority,' fire department spokeswoman Sunny Smaldino told The Gazette. 'When they arrived here, they heard people were down. They went in, and they made sure that everybody was out of the building.' Titanium tetrachloride is 'highly . irritating to the skin, eyes and mucous membranes in humans,' according . to the Environmental Protection Agency. Chemistry: The incident happened when a group of chemistry students were drilling into a pressurized container to obtain titanium tetrachloride . Short-term exposure 'may result in surface skin burns and marked congestion and constriction of various sections of the upper respiratory tract in humans. Acute exposure may also damage the eyes.' The 13 people exposed to the chemical were decontaminated before they were sent to hospital. Firefighters said only one person - a . Colorado College employee - remained in serious condition on Wednesday . evening but is expected to recover. The fire alarm went off just hours after the school tested its emergency mass notification system, according to The Catalyst. Scene: The incident happened at one of the labs at Colorado College, pictured . This confused some students who thought the second alarm was part of the exercise. 'This is not a drill,' the system warned students after the exposure. All campus buildings and nearby roads were shut down after the evacuation but most were reopened by around 8 p.m. last night. Monika Rozkowska, a senior, told KOAA.com that students became worried after smoke started filling the building. 'Some of my friends in the anatomy class a few doors down said all they saw was just smoke everywhere and then everybody had to be evacuated,' she said.","Firefighters rushed to Colorado College's Olin Hall at around 3 p.m. yesterday after reports that students and school staff had been exposed to titanium tetrachloride .

A handwritten letter by scientist Francis Crick announcing his discovery of the DNA model to his son has sold at a New York auction for $5.3 million making it the world's most expensive letter. In the letter dated 19 March 1953 to his 12-year-old son Michael, the British scientist describes his discovery of the structure of DNA as something 'very beautiful,' weeks before it was even made public. Christie's auction house had previously estimated the letter would fetch only $1 million to $2 million. Breakthrough: In page one, seen, of British scientist Francis Crick's letter dated 19 March 1953 to his 12-year-old son, he announces his monumental discovery of the structure of DNA . Step-by-step: The father offers his 12-year-old son a step-by-step, easy to read guide to each part of his model here seen composed of sugar and phosphorus . 'We have built a model for . the structure of des-oxy-ribose-nucleic-acid, called DNA for . short,' he writes of his breakthrough with James Watson and Maurice Wilkins. 'In other words we think we have found the basic copying . mechanism by which life comes from life.' It includes a simple sketch of DNA's double helix structure, which he writes underneath: 'the model looks much nicer than this.' He would go on to win a Nobel Prize for his work, which revolutionized our understanding of genetics. The seven-page letter, written to his son in boarding school, concludes: 'Read this carefully so that you will understand it. When you come home we will show you the model. Lots of love, Daddy.' Dr Crick, who died in 2004 at age 88, was awarded the Nobel prize along with Watson and Maurice Wilkins. Price tag: The letter, which shared his discovery weeks before it was announced to the public, was sold for $5.3 million at auction on Wednesday . Composition: Here, on page four of seven, Dr Crick explains the various orders of each base that make up the model, abbreviated A, G, T and C . First to know: Dr Crick is seen with his son, Michael, whom he wrote the letter to in 1953 while his son was away in boarding school . Topped: The letter by Dr Crick, who is seen back in the day working, easily passed the $3.4million spent in 2008 on a letter written by Abraham Lincoln . The items are among a dozen artifacts Dr Crick's heirs are selling to benefit scientific research. Half the proceeds from the Christie's sale would benefit the Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, where Dr Crick was a professor, the granddaughter said. Twenty percent of the proceeds from the Heritage Auctions sale would go to the new Francis Crick Institute in London, a medical research institute due to open in 2015. The price was a record for a letter sold at auction, Christie's said, eclipsing an Abraham Lincoln letter that sold in April 2008 for $3.4m including commission. Other items in the Heritage sale include Dr Crick's . endorsed Nobel prize check in the amount of 85,739,88 Swedish krona, . dated 10 December 962, and a white lab coat complete with stains and . wear. Dr Crick's son, Michael Crick, now 72 and living in . Seattle, still fondly recalls his father's discovery. 'My father believed that DNA . contained some sort of code so he got interested in codes and he shared . his enthusiasm with me. 'Everything came together in February . 1953 when my father and Jim Watson were given the . go-ahead to try and construct a model of DNA. 'My father's enthusiasm could not be . contained. The story is told of him sweeping excitedly into a local pub . called the Eagle and announcing to all who would listen that he had . found “the secret of life”. Then on March 19 my father wrote to me . describing the model and its implications. I was 12 at the time and away . at Bedales – the British boarding school. Discoverer at work: Dr Crick in seen in 1993 in Paris, standing before a blackboard that explains his work to discover the molecular structure on DNA . 'When I returned to Cambridge my father very proudly showed me the model. 'The excitement of the event was . beautifully captured for the first time in this perfect letter . summarising the discovery in seven simple pages.' Dr Crick, Watson and Wilkins all won the Nobel Prize for physiology and medicine in 1962. Attempting to put his work in simple . terms, Dr Crick wrote to his son that DNA could be thought of as a 'very . long chain with flat bits sticking out, called the “bases”'. He said: . 'We have two of these chains winding round each other – each one is a . helix – and the chain, made up of sugar and phosphorus, is on the . outside and the bases are all on the inside. 'Now the exciting thing is that while there are four different bases we find we can only put certain pairs of them together.'

Lab coat: Sandra Palomino, director of historical manuscripts at Heritage Auctions, shows a lab coat worn by Dr. Francis Harry Compton Crick, complete with stains, that was auctioned off . DNA, or deoxyribonucleic acid, is a giant molecule containing the coded instructions of life. Two Cambridge scientists, James Watson and Francis Crick, first described its famous double-helix structure in 1953, changing the face of biology for ever. The complete set of DNA instructions that makes us what we are is known as the Human Genome. Within it, there are 2.9 billion chemical ""letters"". Certain sequences of these letters make up the genes, the ""software"" that tells cellular machinery how to make all the proteins in the body. Working out the entire pattern of DNA in the human genome is a technical achievement that has been compared with landing men on the moon. A DNA molecule consists of two strands that wrap around each other to resemble a twisted ladder. The sides of the ladder, made of sugar and phosphate molecules, are connected by rungs of chemicals called nucleotide bases. Four different bases are present in DNA, and it is these that make up the letters in the genetic code. They are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C) and guanine (G). The two DNA strands are held together by weak bonds between bases attached to each strand, forming base pairs. Genome size is usually defined as the total number of base pairs. In the case of the human genome, the figure is 2.9 billion.","Letter was expected to fetch only $1 million to $2 million at auction .

Former guards at the death camp that has become the most enduring symbol of the Holocaust could face prosecution almost seven decades after the fall of the Nazi regime. Germany’s Central Office for the Investigation of National Socialist (Nazi) Crimes is set to begin proceedings against 50 former guards at the notorious concentration camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Kurt Schrimm, the head of the office, says staff scoured records and documents from the horrific era and travelled to Poland to create the list of living guards, reports the New York Times. Kurt Schrimm, head of Central Office of the Judicial Authorities of the Federal States for The Investigation of National Socialist Crimes, has announced 50 former death camp guards may face prosecution . Darkness: The 50 former guards at Auschwitz are still alive, but some may have already faced trial over their actions at the death camp . The investigators now have to cross-reference the list against those who were tried by the Allies or the German legal system. 'We have to determine now whether or not these 50 people that we found on this list can be legally prosecuted,' Mr. Schrimm said yesterday. One of the driving influences behind the list was the case of Nazi concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk, who was found guilty of 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder two years ago and sentenced to five years in jail. Kurt Schrimm said: 'We have to determine now whether or not these 50 people that we found on this list can be legally prosecuted' Ukrainian-born Demjanjuk was a guard at Sobibor camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. The retired car-plant worker from Ohio was deported to Germany and convicted in Munich in May last year of 28,060 counts of being an accessory to murder and sentenced to five years in jail. He died last year. Mr Schrimm added that the list includes some new names, as well as a number that have been known to his office since the Auschwitz trials in the 1960s. The move has been applauded by Efraim Zuroff at the Nazi-hunting Simon Wiesenthal Center. He said: 'We’re very happy that this thing is happening.' 'It’s definitely the right thing to do. But the real test of the initiative will come when these cases are turned over to the prosecutors.' Some have called for a different, softer approach to the remaining, elderly, supporters of the Nazis, something similar to South Africa's Truth and Reconciliation Commission, which probed Apartheid in South Africa after it fell. Such a move is not acceptable to Mr Zuroff. 'It’s good for countries where there’s apartheid,' Mr. Zuroff said. 'Not where there’s genocide.' Nearly a million people were estimated to have died at Auschwitz, and between 15 and 20 million died as a result of the Holocaust.

When Charlie Curtis broke his ankle during a climbing accident, his regular exercise regime hit something of a brick wall. The 30-year-old director of a London architecture firm watched his physical fitness slip away, along with his body confidence, so as soon as his foot was on the mend he decided to take up an active pastime that wouldn't put undue stress on his healing fibula: swimming. And just six weeks into his training plan, Charlie has lost 10kg and seen extraordinary results - most noticeably around his middle, where a soft paunch has made way for an enviably tight six-pack. Charlie gained weight after breaking his ankle and was unhappy with his figure, left, so Speedo helped him get back in shape, and within just six weeks had developed an impressive six-pack through swimming . Charlie was given his watery exercise schedule by Speedo, who helped him rebuild his fitness and regain his physique after the injury. Former Olympic swimmer and Speedo ambassador Karen Pickering got to work creating him a bespoke swimming programme which involved hitting the pool with her twice a week for 45 minutes , and another couple of times by himself. Charlie, who cut out alcohol from his otherwise healthy diet but didn't make any other changes, said: 'I can't believe . how different I look and feel in just six weeks and couldn't be happier. 'I put on a lot of weight when I broke my ankle but since starting the . swimming training I have dropped from a 36-inch waist to a 32-inch. My . friends have all noticed the difference, and I feel so much fitter and . stronger when carrying out other exercises or even daily activities.' Charlie said: 'My . friends have all noticed the difference, and I feel so much fitter and . stronger when carrying out other exercises or even daily activities' Charlie's exercise plan involved swimming twice a week for 45 minutes for just six weeks . He told MailOnline: 'I was pretty . healthy before the accident, so it was more about getting into shape . again after six months off and a couple of surgeries. 'Swimming isn't normally touted as something that's good for cardio, but I noticed a difference in my fitness after just two weeks. My physio was also really impressed with the progress my leg has made, and three weeks ago I was even able to start running again for the first time. But I still hate running. 'I've kept up the swimming and go at least twice a week. I was so surprised at how effective it was; I'm in he best shape I've been in since university.' In just six weeks Charlie lost an impressive four inches from around his waist through swimming . Charlie's trainer Karen commented: . 'Swimming is one of the best forms of exercise and it is great to see . the results on Charlie's physique and well-being. 'There is a big misconception that . swimming is boring and not that effective, but you can mix it up with . different equipment to keep things varied and to target specific problem . areas. 'Swimming is . also great for injury recovery, like in Charlie's case, as the sport has . a high impact on fitness levels but low impact on the joints and can . target the specific muscles you need to rebuild.' Charlie's programme included aerobic fitness drills and techniques using swimming equipment to build-up his fitness levels and stamina whilst remaining low impact on his ankle. He swam twice a week for 45 minutes each time, and undertook core strength and leg exercises supported with kick boards and hydro discs to define his abs and arms andrebuild the strength in his leg. Sally Polak, Marketing Manager for Speedo UK, said: 'We're passionate about making swimming both effective and fun.

"PUBLISHED: . 07:38 EST, 10 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:27 EST, 10 April 2013 . Syria's most powerful rebel group has formally pledged allegiance to al Qaeda leader Ayman al-Zawahri, according to recording posted online today. The al-Nusra group, the strongest extremist movement in Syria, issued a statement of support for the terror network. Abu Mohammad al-Golani, leader of the Syrian group, said: 'The sons of Nusra Front renew their pledge (of allegiance) to the Sheikh of Jihad Ayman al-Zawahri and declare obedience.' Al-Qaida's branch in Iraq and the most powerful rebel group in Syria have now officially joined ranks against President Bashar Assad to forge a potentially formidable militant force in the Middle East. Rebel rise: Men said to be from al-Qaida affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra sit on a truck full of ammunition at Taftanaz air base, which has been captured by the rebels, in Idlib province, northern Syria . New Islamist front: Rebels said to be from Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra waving their brigade flag on the top of a Syrian air force helicopter at insurgent-held Taftanaz air base in Idlib province, northern Syria . The merger of the Islamic State in Iraq and Jabhat al-Nusra forms a new entity that could be an even stronger opponent in the fight to topple Assad and become a dominant player in what eventually replaces his regime. The new group, called the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, underscores the growing confidence and muscle of Islamist radicals fighting on the rebel side in Syria's civil war. It also bolsters the Syrian government's assertions that the regime is battling terrorists and that the uprising is a foreign-backed plot. While the U.S. and its European and Gulf allies are concerned about the rising prominence of Islamists among the rebels, the merger is unlikely to prompt a shift in the international support. Late last year, Washington declared that Jabhat al-Nusra had ties to al-Qaida and designated it a terrorist organization. To try to counter the rising influence of Jabhat al-Nusra and other Islamic extremists in the civil war, the U.S. and its allies have boosted their support for rebel factions deemed to be more moderate. On the political front, they helped created the opposition umbrella group, the Syrian National Coalition, in the hope that it will serve as the united face of those trying to unseat Assad and administer much of the territory in northern Syria that rebels have managed to pry away from regime forces in the past year. The U.S. and other countries also have stepped up covert support for rebels on the ground by helping to coordinate shipments of new weapons and training rebels in Jordan, officials say. Those receiving training are mainly secular Sunni Muslim tribesmen from central and southern Syria who once served in the army and police. Under attack: A member of the Free Syrian Army runs along with two men to take cover from snipers loyal to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, in Deir al-Zor yesterday . Attack on dictator: Fighter from Islamist Syrian rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra runs with weapon as their base is shelled in Raqqa province, eastern Syria . The force is seen as a counterbalance to the Islamic militant groups - chief among them Jabhat al-Nusra - that have proven to be among the most effective of the myriad rebel factions fighting Assad's forces, officials say. The merger was announced by the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a 21-minute audio message posted on militant websites late Monday. A website linked to Jabhat al-Nusra known as al-Muhajir al-Islami - the Islamic emigrant - confirmed the merger. Together, the groups will now be known as the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant, al-Baghdadi said. The Levant is the traditional name referring to the region from southern Turkey to Egypt on the eastern Mediterranean. 'It is time to announce to the Levantine people and the whole world that Jabhat al-Nusra is merely an extension and part of the Islamic State of Iraq,' he said. Joint force: Members of Islamist Syrian rebel group Jabhat al-Nusra hold a detainee as they transport him in Raqqa province, eastern Syria in a picture taken on March 14 . He said the Iraqi group was providing half of its budget to the conflict in Syria, and that Jabhat al-Nusra would not have a separate leader but instead be led by the 'people of Syria themselves' - implying that he would be in charge in both countries. The announcement comes two days after the leader of al-Qaida, Ayman al-Zawahiri, urged Islamic fighters in Syria to unite in their efforts to oust Assad. Jabhat al-Nusra, which has welcomed militants from across the Muslim world into its ranks, has made little secret of its links across the Iraqi border, but until now it has not officially declared itself to be part of al-Qaida. The Syrian group, which wants to oust Assad and replace his regime with an Islamic state, first emerged in a video posted online in January 2012. Since then, it has demonstrated its prowess - and ruthlessness - on the battlefield. It has claimed responsibility for many of the deadliest suicide bombings against Syrian government institutions and military facilities. The group's success helped fuel a surge in its popularity among rebel fighters, although it has also emerged as a source of friction with more moderate and secular brigades in Syria.","Iraq's Al Qaeda branch joins forces with Syria outpost al-Nusur Front .

The surviving son of fraudster Bernie Madoff has blamed the stress of living with his father's $65 billion Ponzi scheme for his cancer relapse. Andrew Madoff, 47, said that his mantle-cell lymphoma had been in remission for 10 years until his father was revealed as a fraudster in 2008 and his brother subsequently committed suicide in 2010. 'One way to think of this is the . scandal and everything that happened killed my brother very quickly,' Andrew told People magazine. 'And it's killing me slowly.' Relapse: Andrew Madoff, the son of fraudster Bernie Madiff, has claimed that the stress of his father's financial scandal and arrest sparked his 2012 cancer relapse and is 'killing him slowly' Andrew Madoff, himself a trader in his father's New York-based company, has always denied knowing anything about the scheme which sent his father to a North Carolina prison for 150 years in 2009. 'I will never forgive him for what he did,' he said. 'He's already dead to me. I feel horrible for the people whose lives have been destroyed by my father's crimes.' He first battled the rare cancer in 2003 and has been undergoing annual tests to check that he has not relapsed. He said he was 'blindsided' to learn it had returned in October last year. 'I had no symptoms,' he said. 'I felt fine.' Ahead of the scandal: Ruth and Bernie Madoff with their two sons before his 2008 Ponzi scheme arrest . Behind bars: Bernie Madoff, pictured in 2009, is now serving a 150-year sentence in North Carolina . Now he will undergo a stem cell . transplant at the end of this month in the hopes of kicking the disease. He revealed his fears to People. 'My cousin died from the side effects of his stem-cell transplant, so that's on my mind,' he said. Andrew . was diagnosed shortly after reconciling with his mother, Ruth, whom he . and his brother Mark had shunned after she stood by their father in the . wake of the scandal. But he added that he has no interest in reconciling with his father. Bernie was arrested on December 11, . 2008, following his $65 billion Ponzi scheme which became the largest . financial fraud in history. He pleaded guilty to 11 federal felonies in March 2009. Tragic: Mark Madoff, pictured with his wife Stephanie and their son, killed himself two years after the arrest . Struggle: Mark Madoff killed himself in 2010 while his two-year-old son slept in the next room . The charges included securities fraud, wire fraud, mail fraud, money . laundering, making false statements, perjury, theft from an employee . benefit plan and making false filings with the SEC. Andrew told People that when he and his brother turned his father in, it was 'at the same time the easiest decision I ever had to make and the hardest'. Struggling to deal with the revelations, Mark Madoff, 46, hanged himself in his apartment on the second anniversary of his father's arrest, as his two-year-old son was asleep in the room next door. 'My brother did not like to lean on his friends for support,' Andrew said. 'And he suffered alone because of it.' Fears: Madoff, with his fiance Catherine Hooper, will undergo a stem cell transplant this month . The other Madoffs have always claimed to have known nothing about Bernie's Ponzi scheme. Defrauded Madoff investors have long viewed the convicted swindler's sons, wife and other family member suspiciously, arguing it is impossible that they did not know about his lies. No family members have been criminally charged.","Andrew Madoff, 47, was first diagnosed with rare cancer in 2003 .

Lluvia Paloma Rodriguez, 29, was found guilty of biting off her sister Ivon's nose and sentenced to five years' probation . A woman found guilty of biting off her sister's nose will not serve a prison sentence, a court heard today. Lluvia Paloma Rodriguez, 29, bit off the nose of her sister, Ivon Rodriguez, in July last year when Ivon intervened in an argument between Rodriguez and her husband. Ivon's nose was completely severed from her face, and needed four operations to reattach and reconstruct it using cartilage and skin. Rodriguez was found guilty of felony aggravated assault of a family member. The maximum sentence for the crime is up to 20 years in jail. But Rodriguez walked free from court with a sentence of five years' probation, 240 hours of community service and she must pay a $500 fine. She must also pay $62,000 in restitution to her sister and write her letter of apology for biting off her nose. The assault occurred when Ivon intervened in an argument between Rodriguez and her husband at their home in northwest Houston. Rodriguez first bit into her sister's arm, before severing her nose, in an act she claims was self defense because she believed Ivon was going to kill her. A case document stated: ‘The defendant assaulted (her sister) by biting her arm with her teeth. Ivon Rodriguez showed signs of surgery to her nose as she appeared in court to testify against her sister . 'The defendant then bit the (victim's) nose off, severing it and detaching her nose from her face, causing pain and serious bodily injury.’ During the prosecution statements Rodriguez was described as a 'mean angry drunk' by attorney Beth Exley, while attorney Adam Brodrick described the assault as a 'vicious animal-like attack'. The victim underwent surgery at Ben Taub Hospital, where doctors successfully reattached her nose over a series of operations, and she is expected to need two further surgeries. Ivon's facial scars were visible in court on Monday when she testified against her sister, who was detained at the Harris County Jail prior to the trial.","Lluvia Rodriguez claimed she bit off sister Ivon's nose as act of self defense .

Danica Patrick is not the only one paving the way for women on the NASCAR track - now the sport also has its first ever full-time female pit crew member. Christmas Abbott, a glamorous weight lifter who runs her own CrossFit center and has worked as a defense contractor in Iraq, has earned a spot as a tire changer on a NASCAR pit crew. The 31-year-old, 5ft 3, 115-pound athlete from Raleigh, North Carolina made her debut in February, working on driver Jennifer Jo Cobb's truck at the Daytona International Speedway. Next she is under a full-time contract with Michael Waltrip Racing, working on Clint Bowyer's crew. Scroll down for video . Success story: Christmas Abbott, 31, has become the first full-time pit crew member for NASCAR . Other women have featured in the Sprint Cup Series, Abbott explained, but none has ever been hired full-time for a season. But even though she knows she stands out due to her gender, Abbott, who can dead lift 255 pounds and change two 60-pound tires in 12 seconds, told Sporting News she is doing it for the love of it. 'It's not a gender issue for me,' Abbott . said. 'I decided to change tires . because I liked what I did. I liked the excitement of it, the challenge . and what it presented. That's why I pursued this sport.' Abbott first considered working on a pit crew on the suggestion of a friend - and even though she wasn't initially taken by the idea, her first time watching a pit crew changed everything. Glamorous: She said that her fitness and NASCAR passions do not mean she still doesn't get girly . Strength: Abbott, who can dead lift 255 pounds, is able to change two 60-pound tires in 12 seconds . 'I heard the noise for a gun [to remove the nut lugs] and . that got my attention,' she said. 'And then I saw how fast they do it . and the little orchestrated dance they do with the car and I was just . fascinated.' She said she had grown up watching racing but had never really considered the crews before. 'I had no idea it was that exciting and . challenging,' she said. 'It's a highly tuned technical skill and it’s . pretty incredible how spot-on you have to be every single time.' But Abbott, who has a gun tattooed on her leg to remind her of the time she spent in Iraq, said she had already confidence in her abilities while working  in a military laundry center in a war zone. She said that, there too, she was often one of the few women, but she simply got up and did her job. Tough: Abbott worked in Iraq as a defense contractor before she began training for the pit stops . Team: Her crew said that they thought it was a publicity stunt at first but were impressed with her skills . She added that this time, she knows she has a much bigger audience - and her new-found fame is something she hopes will help other women work towards their dreams. 'There are more eyes on me,' she . said. 'There are more eyes on Michael Waltrip and NASCAR now because of . this. I think it is a positive highlight and [women] are going to be . there sooner or later. 'I just hope I can perform to where I want to perform.' She added to the Resigter Bee that she hopes everyone realizes the job is there for the taking if they put in enough hard work. 'There are other female drivers that I think are overlooked a lot,' she said. 'I just want there to be more attention across the board. This is a sport that anyone can get to, whether you’re male, female, Hispanic, it doesn’t matter. This is an open-door opportunity for anyone who wants to take it.' Power: Abbott, who also runs a CrossFit center, said she hopes other women will join the sport . The Waltrip team said they were proud to welcome Abbott to their training sessions - but it was entirely due to her skills, rather than the attention it would bring to the crew. 'She is an incredible elite athlete,' co-owner Michael Waltrip said. 'She . is a competitor and when she decided to start working towards an . over-the-wall position, we said we are the perfect place to make it . happen.' She now trains once or twice a day with the team. 'We expect her to excel or we wouldn't commit the position to her,' Waltrip said.","Christmas Abbott is under contract with Michael Waltrip Racing .

A military judge cleared the way on Wednesday for a member of the team that raided Osama bin Laden's compound to testify in the trial of Bradley Manning who is charged in a massive leak of U.S. secrets. Colonel Denise Lind ruled for the prosecution during a pretrial hearing for Pfc. Bradley Manning at Fort Meade, near Baltimore. The government said the witness, presumably a Navy SEAL, collected digital evidence showing that an associate of bin Laden provided the al Qaeda leader with documents Manning has acknowledged sending to the WikiLeaks website. On trial: PFC Bradley Manning is escorted by military police as he departs the courtroom at Fort Meade, Maryland on Wednesday . Defense attorneys argued that proof of receipt isn't relevant to whether Manning aided the enemy. The judge disagreed. She said the government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that intelligence was both given to and received by the enemy. The hearing, scheduled through until Friday, focuses on multiple questions about the evidence the government must produce at trial to prove its charges. Manning pleaded guilty in February to lesser versions of some of the 22 charges he faces. Facing life in prison: Manning is charged with causing hundreds of thousands of classified documents to be published on the secret-sharing website WikiLeaks . Scrutiny: Army Pfc. Bradley Manning is escorted into a courthouse in Fort Meade for his pre-trial hearing . Prosecutors have said they still intend to prove him guilty of the original charges, including aiding the enemy, which carries a maximum life sentence. His court-martial is scheduled to start on June 3 at Fort Meade. The 25-year-old native of Crescent, Oklahoma, is accused of sending hundreds of thousands of Iraq and Afghanistan battlefield reports, State Department diplomatic cables, other classified records and two battlefield video clips to WikiLeaks in 2009 and 2010 while working as an intelligence analyst in Baghdad. In a statement he read aloud in court February 28, Manning said he sent the material to the anti-secrecy website to expose the American military's 'bloodlust' and disregard for human life in Iraq and Afghanistan.

Google has released a new online tool in the UK that will mean that anyone can become a ‘citizen cartographer’. The Google Map Maker will allow people to add detailed local knowledge to Google Maps in the UK. It will enable people to contribute and edit map data as well as drawing and labelling local maps. The Google Map Maker will allow people to add detailed local knowledge to Google Maps in the UK . It is hoped that the product will mean that users can improve the quality of maps using their local knowledge of features such as footpaths, forests, parks, and golf courses, as these features have traditionally been less well mapped. It will also mean that people can add relevant information that has previously not been present, such as the location of post offices, agricultural details, camping sites, barbeque areas, new bus stations, and even drinking water fountains . Google hopes that the Map Maker will enable people to quickly transform a simple map into a more detailed and accurate representation of a city’s local treasures and that it will make the maps of the UK more comprehensive and accurate than ever before. When someone logs in to use the programme they are presented with an interface that allow them to add places, roads, rivers and railways, building outlines or natural features. Click through options then allow extra detail about features to be added. Once someone has added to a map the improvement has to be approved before it appears across Google Maps, Google Earth, and Google Maps for Mobile. London¿s Bletchley Park was the first place in the UK to have contributions made by people using the programme (the image shows the map of the area before their contributions were added) Image shows the Google Map after Map Maker users had added their local knowledge . The contributions will be reviewed by fellow users, regional experts and a team of Google reviews who will look for duplications and potential spam. Google is launching Map Maker with a workshop at London’s Bletchley Park today – this was the first place in the UK to have contributions made by people using the programme. Google’s ‘citizen cartographer’ has been released in the UK at a time when it is known that both Apple and Nokia are investing in rival free mapping programmes. It was first released in about 15 countries in 2008, it was then extended to much of the rest of the world but because of ‘technical obstacles’ the company has only just been able to bring the technology to the UK.","The Google Map Maker will allow people to become 'citizen cartographers'

Two investors who bought a dilapidated cottage for $300,000 are set to make a $30million profit on the deal after discovering an amazing haul of lost artwork by a previous resident. Thomas Schultz and Larry Joseph snapped up the bungalow on New York's Long Island in 2007 intending to do it up and sell it on for around $100,000 more than they paid. But they found thousands of abstract paintings and drawings by Armenian-American artist Arthur Pinajian, who lived in the house for decades but never received critical recognition during his lifetime. Six years after the stunning discovery, the work has been valued at $30 million and some of the works have gone on display in a Manhattan gallery where he had always dreamed of exhibiting. Scroll down for video . Discovery: Thomas Schultz, pictured, surrounded by paintings by Arthur Pinajian, an unknown artist whose house was filled with thousands of artworks when Mr Schultz bought it in 2007 . Discovery: More than 70,000 paintings, sketches and journals were found in the artist's former home . When Schultz and Joseph bought the house from the Pinajian family in the hope of turning a quick profit, the artist's relatives advised the new owners simply to throw away the art stored in the cottage. Thousands of pieces had been stored there since Pinajian's death in 1999 aged 85. But instead the canny investors agreed to buy the art for $2,500 - though more out of sympathy than with an eye to making money. 'I didn't want to be the person responsible for throwing a man's life's work into a dumpster,' Mr Schultz told CBS New York. 'Someone's life's work deserved more than that.' Stash: Pinajian's relatives said they could just throw the works away but the buyers could not do it . A life's work: Pinajian spent years copying famous artists' work to teach himself the craft . 'Thrilled': Thomas Schultz said he could not bear to throw away all of the artwork when it was found . Arthur Pinajian may have been dubbed one of the best abstract painters of his era, but it was an accolade he did not live to enjoy. Instead, the  Armenian-American artist, who died in 1999 aged 85, was better known as a cartoonist in his lifetime. He trained himself to draw while growing up in West Hoboken, New Jersey, and was active as a comic book artist and creator from the 1930s until the 1950s. He found considerable success creating comic strips for Quality, Marvel and Centaur Comics. After . serving in World War II, he began working on his own - devoting himself to studying well-known artists and developing his own style using structural colour. But he had little commercial success and . largely relied on his sister, a secretary, for financial support. The two men started to restore Pinajian's collection, which included abstract expressionist paintings, comic book illustrations and sketches of his fellow Second World War soldiers. In total, they came across 70,000 paintings, sketches and journals of his work. As they restored Pinajian's art, his reputation began to grow; art historian William Innes Homer recently dubbed him one of the best abstract painters of his era. Pinajian's recovered paintings were appraised by Peter Hastings Falk, a leading author who has previously worked for Andy Warhol's estate. The total value is believed to be around $30million. However, it could take several decades to sell of all the work. Nevertheless, 'I was surprised and thrilled', Mr Schultz said. Fifty of the artist's best works are currently on display in the Fuller Building in New York City. Pinajian had long wanted to show his work in the skyscraper, according to Mr Schultz. 'The . artist was in the Fuller Building in the 1950s when he was visiting an . exhibition of de Kooning's works,' he told CBS. 'He talked about how he . thought his works were better than de Kooning.' Talent: Pinajian was known as a comic book artist in his lifetime but devoted his later years to abstract work . Devoted: Pinajian, pictured left aged 18 and right when he served in World War II, was a self-taught artist . The painter was born in New Jersey in 1914, and worked as a company clerk and cartoonist before the War. Afterwards . he devoted himself to his art, but had little commercial success and . largely relied on his sister, a secretary, for financial support. The pair, neither of whom ever married, lived together in Bellport for nearly three decades. His cousin John Aramian said he would be delighted with his posthumous recognition. 'He thought he was going to be the next Picasso,' he told the New York Times in 2007. 'They believed he would become famous and this would all pay off for them one day, but it just never happened.'

A married teacher appeared in court yesterday accused of repeatedly having sex with a 14-year-old former student. Sixth-grade English teacher Daniel Reilly, 36, used cellphone code names to keep the affair between him and his former student a secret from his wife and her family, Queens prosecutors said. Ex-Marine Reilly is accused of having sex at least 10 times with the girl in his apartment in Forest Hills, New York, when his wife and their new baby daughter were out. English teacher Daniel Reilly, 36, is alleged to have had an eight-month affair with a 14-year-old former pupil . Yesterday he was arraigned and released on $30,000 bail paid by his lawyer wife Annemarie, who attended the court and listen to the charges with her mother. If convicted, he faces seven years in prison. Court documents suggested that their most recent tryst took just days before Reilly was arrested at Intermediate School 237 in Flushing after his alleged victim's mother alerted the school. The prosecutor told Queens Criminal Court that the alleged relationship began last year after he pursued the girl, who originally just wanted to be friends with him. He is alleged to have begun texting her last August before inviting her to his apartment when his wife and 11-month-old daughter were out. Reilly, who faces statutory rape charges, is said to have given the girl a code-name to use so that her parents would not discover the affair, while he used another code for her so his wife Annemarie would remain in the dark. Intermediate School 237 in Flushing, New York,where Daniel Reilly was a sixth-grade English teacher . The prosecutor said: 'The defendant planned on keeping the affair secret', according to a report in the New York Daily News. It said the relationship was only discovered when the victim's sister discovered texts from Reilly on her sister's cellphone. She told her parents, who alerted IS237, where the girl is no longer a student, and they hauled him out of class while they rang police. The $61,000-a-year teacher, who served as a sergeant in the Marines between 1996-2000, is said to have no history of disciplinary problems since he began working as a teacher in 2007. Queens DA Richard Brown told the New York Post: 'This case is particularly disturbing.  Schools should be safe havens for children. 'Instead, this defendant is accused of sexually preying upon one of his former students and rendezvousing with her at his residence.' Schools chancellor Dennis Walcott said: 'As I've said before, this is totally unacceptable.  We have no tolerance for that. 'Keep your hands off our students.' Reilly is said to have been honorably discharged from the Marines in 2000, and is a popular teacher at the school where he has taught for six years. He is charged with second-degree rape, criminal sexual acts, and endangering the welfare of a child, and is due back in court on May 6.  A victim order has been issued on behalf of the teen.","Daniel Reilly, 36, faces rape, child endangerment, and sexual abuse charges .

Freeman Burkholder will leave several children behind when he goes to jail Friday for his part in the hair and beard-cutting scandal against other Amish . Amish schoolchildren held their end-of-school celebration early yesterday so their parents could attend before they are jailed for beard-cutting. Nine members of the Ohio Amish sect led by Samuel Mullet Sr are already in prison after being convicted of the hate crime against rival followers, and five more will join them this Friday. Four women and one man will start jail terms of between one and seven years, leaving nearly three dozen children without one or both parents for the duration of their sentences. They were convicted of cutting off the hair or beards of fellow Amish in a campaign of assaults said to have been orchestrated by the leader of the breakaway sect Mullet Sr. The incidents are considered deeply offensive in Amish culture as the beard is considered a symbol of manhood and faith. Usually the Amish settle disputes within their communities, but in this instance the police were involved because of the seriousness of the assaults, in which victims were said to have been pinned down, screaming, as their beards were hacked off by 'howling' aggressors. Yesterday's end-of-school celebration was brought forward from its usual date at the end of April so that the convicted parents could spend some time with their children before going to jail. Men played baseball in buttoned shirts, work boots and blue pants with suspenders. Their wives, some barefoot, sat on simple wooden benches and chatted, their long-sleeved, blue and green dresses and white head scarves fluttering in the wind. Their children relaxed nearby, dressed like smaller versions of their parents. 'It's . a happy day on the outside, but not on the inside. On the inside, a lot . of times we're crying, but we have to keep our spirits up for the . children's sake,' said Martha Mullet, whose husband, Sam Mullet Sr, was . accused of orchestrating the hair-cutting attacks and was sentenced to . 15 years, the longest term of the 16 defendants in the case.

She said that she believes the government is trying to split up the community but that the members are determined to remain on their current property. Glimpses from the news media are limited in Amish communities, but the members of Mullet's group in Bergholz said they were open to sharing their story because they feel they've been treated unfairly by the justice system. Amish, who shun many facets of modern life, are deeply religious and believe the Bible instructs women to let their hair grow long and men to grow beards and stop shaving once they marry, which means cutting the hair would be shameful and offensive.

The defendants don't deny the hair-cuttings - some say they regret what happened, others don't - but contend they stemmed from family disputes that should have been handled internally. They say that they are bound by different rules guided by their religion and that the government had no business getting involved in what they did. 'We're not exactly saying it was wrong, and we don't say it's right, either. ... It's something that will never happen again, I can tell you that,' said Wilma Mullet, a daughter of Sam Mullet Sr. who was not charged.

All 16 defendants have appealed, arguing that the group's conviction, sentencing and imprisonment in separate facilities as far away as Louisiana, Minnesota and Connecticut violates their constitutional rights and amounts to cruel and unusual punishment, an argument prosecutors reject. The defendants say the distance to the facilities is too great to travel by horse-drawn buggy or even by using a hired driver, so most of their families likely won't be able to visit. The five reporting to prison on Friday said they're scared and not sure what to expect, but they're hopeful about being released early for good behavior. They're sewing clothes, plowing ground and finishing other chores to make life easier for their loved ones who will remain in the community.

Their departure will leave nearly three dozen children without at least one parent, and some without both because their fathers already are incarcerated, so the adults have made alternative arrangements. In some cases, older siblings will look after younger ones. The spouses and 15 children of two defendants, Anna Miller and Freeman Burkholder, are merging under one roof while they serve their one-year sentences. Lovina Miller is beginning a similar sentence and giving Martha Mullet custody of her eight children until she returns because her husband is in Massachusetts on a seven-year sentence. The case has shocked the Amish in America and shone a light on their strictly traditional ways . Amish children from first through eighth grade sang songs in German and English for their parents . Emma Miller was convicted and sentenced to prison for her role in the hair and beard-cutting scandal . Before the trial, the Amish rejected plea agreements that offered leniency and could have helped some of the young mothers avoid prison. Several said yesterday that they rejected those deals, either because they didn't want to admit guilt to a hate crime charge or they didn't want to testify against Mullet Sr. and say things they don't believe. The community members say they're working together to ensure the group perseveres by handling home repairs and various chores that would have been the responsibility of the incarcerated members, with the remaining men especially bearing the burden of extra work. Among them is the 19-year-old grandson who took over running Sam Mullet Sr.'s 700-acre farm.","Four women and one man will be incarcerated, leaving their children behind .

A rape victim who was bound, nearly burnt alive and repeatedly stabbed has been left with the tip of her attacker's blade permanently stuck in her head. Sadistic Ross Parsons, 35, burst into his victim's home with a large kitchen knife when she was sleeping before threatening: 'Don't say anything or I will kill you'. He then subjected the terrified 46-year-old to a harrowing knifepoint sexual assault in her bedroom before tying her to the bed with her clothes and wires. Parsons then stuffed her mouth with clothing, bound her so she could not move and set fire to the bed she was lying on in her home in Bristol. She frantically tried to escape but Parsons launched a relentless knife attack - stabbing her more than 11 times in the chest, neck, face and head. The brave woman remarkably survived the chilling ordeal but has been left with the tip of the kitchen knife lodged behind her ear. Parsons, who had been released from prison just nine days before the attack, is currently serving a life sentence with a minimum term of 15 years. Speaking for the first time after the October 2010 attack, his victim, who cannot be named for legal reasons, described her experience as 'like a horror film'. She told how she awoke in her bedroom in the early hours of the morning to find him at the door brandishing a knife. 'You see that sort of thing in horror films - it was like being in a horror film,' she said. The woman (not pictured) managed to flee the house where she was raped, stabbed and nearly burnt alive . 'It's the most horrific thing that anyone could ever do to you. 'He was vile, but he didn't beat me. I got the better of him by getting out alive and I'm proud of myself for that. 'Everyone is different, but when I saw him with that kitchen knife I was frightened, but I just felt really alert. 'I used every bit of information I had to survive. I went into survival mode.' The woman used previous knowledge of self-defence to prevent Parsons from taking her life. Parsons had been out of prison on licence for just over a week, having served three-and-a-half years for robbery, assault, possession of an offensive weapon and theft. He entered the house of his victim - who had been asleep alone in her bedroom - and inflicted the harrowing injuries through the sustained attack. Parsons took her personal possessions, including her bank cards and told her he would not harm her if she gave him her pin numbers. She did and Parsons left her alone in her bedroom - before returning twice more to rape her, stab her, and attempt to burn her alive. He set alight two fires in her home, one on the bed which she was tied to and another by stuffing lit clothes down the back of a radiator in her downstairs hallway. The woman said: 'I was tied up and he set fire to the bed. That's when I realised this is it, I'm going to die if I don't do something. 'I was telling him to get out and that's the point when he started stabbing me. I came down the stairs and he was still waiting for me. 'He was acting like someone in a horror film at that point and started attacking me again with the knife. 'I remember him stabbing me in the back of the head. I didn't feel any pain - it was pure survival. You hear someone screaming and then your realise it's you. 'I ended up on the floor. Apparently he stamped on my head too, but I was losing consciousness.' But the woman managed to flee from her burning property and alerted a neighbour who called police. Officers launched a massive manhunt and Parsons, who has 20 previous convictions, was arrested two days later, on October 3, in Knowle, Bristol. He refused to answer any questions but later admitted charges of attempted murder, rape, arson and aggravated burglary. It transpired he had stolen just £250 from the woman, which he used to buy drugs. His victim was left with chest wounds, a collapsed lung, 13 wounds to her head, face, arms and neck. She lost all of her possessions in the fire and has been left with pain from severed muscles. The woman added: 'It's something you live with every day. You can't forget it or blank it out. You always feel like someone is trying to kill you. 'I have to tell people my story. That's helped my recovery - not keeping it a secret. When I speak about it I feel like I'm helping myself and hopefully helping someone else. 'For me, I'm not emotional about it often. I try not to break down.' She has been helped by Safe Links and the Bridge in Bristol, as well as police and supportive friends and family. 'The main thing that gives me comfort is the police caught him and he's gone away for a long time', she added. 'For some victims, the attacker is still walking the streets.' Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Woman was tied up to bed in her own home and stabbed .

A man who has been charged with killing his wife and adult son allegedly told police he stabbed them because he had slept with prostitutes and feared he'd given his wife AIDS. Eugene Maraventano, 63, told police he stabbed his wife, Janet, with a 14-inch kitchen knife as she slept in their home in Goodyear, Arizona and then killed their son, Bryan Maraventano, 27. Maraventano told police that his wife, 63, had become ill and they thought she might have cancer. But when the tests came back negative, he concluded she must have AIDS. He said he was worried he had contracted the disease and given it to her after frequenting prostitutes while working in New York years earlier. Arrest: Eugene Maraventano, 63, (left) allegedly stabbed his wife and 27-year-old son Bryan (right) to death because he thought he had given his wife AIDS from sleeping with prostitutes years ago . Police documents do not say whether either Maraventano or his wife was positive for HIV. He told police he did not want to leave his son without parents because he thought the man could be mentally disabled as he didn't have a girlfriend, couldn't get a job and played video games all day. After killing his wife, he knocked on his son's bedroom door and stabbed him twice when he answered, according to police documents. The killings occurred on Thursday, but he only called 911 on Saturday after repeatedly trying to kill himself but failing, police said. Victim: He also took his son's life because the man couldn't get a job or girlfriend so Maraventano thought he was mentally disabled and would not be able to cope without his parents . 'I killed my wife and I killed my son - I . can't kill myself,' Maraventano told a 911 dispatcher, according to . court documents obtained by Phoneix New Times. He tried to commit suicide by cutting his wrist, suffocating himself with a plastic bag by taping it to his face, and by putting a knife handle against the wall and pushing himself into it. When authorities arrived at the scene, he was taken to hospital for treatment for his injuries. Maraventano told officers that about two weeks before he carried out the murders he had decided to kill Janet but changed his mind, according to court documents. Scene: He told police he repeatedly tried to kill himself after the murders but was unsuccessful each time .

Cash-strapped Britons are throwing children's birthday parties costing up to £500 because of pressure to impress other parents, a report has found. Research shows nearly half (41 per cent) of parents are really too hard-up to give their children a birthday party. But more than a quarter (27 per cent) are still driven to organise one because of 'playground peer pressure' among parents, as well as friends and family. Cash-strapped parents are throwing lavish birthday parties for their children because of playground peer pressure . And more than a third (36 per cent) are splashing out between 80 pounds and a staggering 500 pounds per party in a bid to impress their guests. The report also found the trend for taking cakes and party bags into school for classmates is piling even more pressure on parents' already low incomes. It means 46 per cent of hard-hit families are forced to start saving more than a month in advance of their children's birthday. Others have to prepare for the big day by slashing household costs (21 per cent) or going without new clothes for themselves and their children (27 per cent). The pressure to take elaborate cakes in to school for classmates is adding to the stress levels of parents . Family support service leaders Family Action surveyed 2,052 adults for the Birthdays on the Breadline report. Chief executive David Holmes said: 'Paying for children's parties is clearly causing financial stress for many families, even before the costs of birthday presents are taken into account. 'This stress is magnified for low income families who may find themselves spending the equivalent of a week's living costs for the whole family on a party for a single child. 'If you then add the extra financial pressures low income families in particular face from low wage rises and the squeeze on welfare, paying for children's parties is no cause for celebration. 'Money management programmes such as Money for Life help make parents more resilient to social and financial pressures by building their self-esteem and money skills.' The report is released in partnership with Lloyds Banking Group's Money for Life programme, which focuses on the importance money management. A spokesman added: 'This report shows money management is an increasingly vital life skill with families facing all sorts of unexpected financial pressures.'","Nearly half of British parents claim they are too poor to throw a child's party .

'Never heard of it': Judge Heather Norton expressed astonishment that the prisoner had been sent on a sleep course . A judge has expressed  her astonishment after  being told how a violent prisoner had taken a course on ‘how to get a good night’s sleep’ in his jail cell. Heroin addict Paul Richards,  45, was given classes on how to meditate and develop a healthy sleeping pattern while on remand for assaulting his partner and  possessing drugs. The lessons include advice on the importance of regular bedtimes and taking exercise. Richards’s lawyer, Oliver Kirk, told  Canterbury Crown Court the treatment was designed to help drug users and alcoholics learn to tell the ‘difference between night and day’. But judge Heather Norton, who  was handed a certificate to show Richards had passed the ‘sleep course’, said she had ‘never heard’ of such a programme. She said: ‘This is the first time I have ever heard of someone learning to sleep in their cell. ‘I have never ever heard of anything like this being offered to prisoners.’ Richards, of Dover, was arrested in January last year and jailed because he had a suspended sentence hanging over him for an earlier attack on his partner. He was sent on the course at Elmley prison, on the Isle of Sheppey, while awaiting trial for the attack on Lisa Kennett, which left her ‘terrified for her life’ and with injuries to her  face and body. At the court hearing, Mr Kirk explained that the course ‘is designed to help prisoners meditate and get into a good sleeping routine in their cells and assist them with addressing their drug or alcohol abuse’. He added that many people depending on addictive substances ‘needed help understanding the need to get a good night’s sleep’. Judge Norton replied: ‘That’s news both to me and my fellow judges here at Canterbury Crown Court.’ Prison course: Paul Richards, 45, was sent on a sleeping course while awaiting trial at Canterbury Crown Court (pictured) The therapy encourages prisoners to go to bed at ‘regular times’ and to ‘exercise regularly’ and teaches them that alcohol is a stimulant which doesn’t help them sleep well. Richards admitted common  assault, possession of cannabis and resisting arrest, and was jailed for eight months. Prosecutor Jim Harvey said the attack against Miss Kennett was the second assault she had been subjected to during the stormy relationship, which the court heard she wished to resume. In 2010 it emerged that violent prisoners at Shepton Mallet jail, in Somerset, were given yoga courses to teach them how to relax using ‘Taoist meditation breath work’. And at Portland prison in Dorset, inmates have been taught to control the movement of horses ‘simply by using body language and attitude’ in the hope that developing skills such as communication and empathy would help stop them reoffending.","Paul Richards, 45, taught how to 'meditate' and get into a 'good sleep pattern' during the classes .

Probe: All French ministers have to open their accounts to the Government after former French Budget Minister Jerome Cahuzac admitted having offshore assets . France has ordered all government ministers to publicly declare their assets in the wake of revelations that an ex-cabinet member hid up to £12million from the tax-man in a Swiss bank. The confession by former budget minister Jerome Cahuzac that he 'lied to the president' about dodging tax has sent shockwaves through the deeply unpopular socialist administration. Foreign minister Laurent Fabius was also forced to deny rumours on Monday that he also had a secret Swiss bank account. Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault has now given all ministers until April 15 to publish details of their assets in a desperate bid to restore credibility to the government. A law on financial transparency among ministers and other top officials will also be adopted by the summer, he said in a statement. Measures would also be taken to 'more severely punish breaches of the financial law, ethics and integrity', Mr Ayrault said. Critics have accused Hollande and his ministers of knowing about and covering up Cahuzac's tax dodging and of mismanagement for having believed his denials. A poll this week also revealed three out of five French people want a government re-shuffle - a move that President Hollande has rejected. The Cahuzac scandal and the latest accusations targeting Fabius have come as a massive new blow to Hollande, who made a key manifesto pledge to crack down on tax dodging. The damaging revelations have also erupted as Hollande's popularity is plunging faster and lower than any other modern French president to 22 per cent. French Minister of Foreign Affairs Laurent Fabius 'strongly denies' a rumor that he possesses a Swiss bank account to dodge taxes . Even left-wing Liberation has branded him a 'DIY' president who had failed to prove he is in control . He is facing attacks from all sides that he has failed to keep his manifesto promises to reduce the ballooning public deficit and cut 10.6 per cent unemployment - the highest level since 1997. And his main election pledge to tax all earnings over one million euros (£850,000) at 75 per cent has been thrown out by the Constitutional Court. But even that hasn't stopped a flood of high profile millionaires, including actor Gerard Depardieu and France's richest man Bernard Arnault, fleeing abroad to 'wealth-friendly' countries. French Prime Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault (left) has instigated the probe, as President Hollande (right) scrabbles to restore credibility . His presidency has also been blighted by the massive unpopularity of his girlfriend Valerie Trierweiler, who has been accused of abandoning her socialist principles for a life of 'luxury and frivolity'. The First Lady was 'indifferent' to the plight of millions of struggling families as she cavorted with the nation's wealthy elite, weekly news magazine VSD said. But the president does still have one fervent hotbed of supporters - three thousand miles away in Mali, where he is being hailed as hero after successfully sending in French troops to crush a takeover by extremist Islamist rebels.","Ministers will have to lay bare their accounts following scandal .

The two 15-year-olds allegedly told pals that the killing had made them feel like characters from the notorious game Grand Theft Auto, in which players roam a fictional city stealing cars and killing people. The pair from Udine, in north east Italy, are said to have told police they strangled 67-year-old Mirco Sacher, after he tried to rape them. The girls, known only as A and F because of their age, are then alleged to have stolen his car and fled, driving some 40 miles down the motorway, despite having neither having a driving licence.

Mr Sacher was found dead with his trousers down, in fields on the outskirts of the city, which is close to the border with Slovenia. An autopsy found that the man had been in a 'prolonged and violent' fight before he died. Two of his ribs were broken.

Rockefeller impostor has been found guilty of first-degree murder in the . death of a man whose bones were found buried beneath a California home in 1985. Christian Gerhartsreiter was tried 28 years after the . disappearance of newlyweds John and Linda Sohus in a heavily . circumstantial cold case. Much of the prosecution’s evidence focused on . the strange behavior of the man who adopted many names including Clark . Rockefeller. He masqueraded as an heir to the fabled oil fortune for 20 . years. The verdict was reached on Wednesday after the jury deliberated about a day. Scroll down for video . Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter of Germany is found guilty of first degree murder in his murder trial in Los Angeles Superior Court in Los Angeles, California, today . Authorities said Gerhartsreiter was a German immigrant who lived . another life long ago, occupying a guest cottage at the home of Sohus’ mother in the ritzy suburb of San Marino. He was known then as Chris . Chichester and intimated he was of royal lineage. He joined the church, . befriended residents and told some he was a film student. A friend . said Linda Sohus once described the tenant in the cottage owned by . John’s mother as 'creepy' and said she and her husband never spoke to . him. The town folk didn’t connect him with the disappearance of the Sohus couple in 1985, but shortly after they vanished, so did he. No . trace of Linda has been found but John’s bones were unearthed during . excavation of a swimming pool at the San Marino property in 1994. With . no clues, the mystery went cold again. Christian Gerhartsreiter sits with one of his attorneys as a verdict was reached at the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal Justice Center in Los Angeles today . Gerhartsreiter, who went by the alias Clark Rockefeller,was found guilty of killing his landlord, John Sohus, in February 1985 . The German native who consorted for years with New Englandís social elite by pretending to be a Rockefeller was convicted Wednesday in Los Angeles of first-degree murder . But across the country, a man variously known as Chris Crowe, Chip . Smith and Clark Rockefeller was inventing new lives for himself. This . impostor wormed his way into high society and talked his way into . important jobs. He married a wealthy woman and controlled her funds, but . his identity unraveled when he kidnapped their daughter during a . custody dispute. She testified that he became increasingly paranoid when . police begin inquiring about him. When he was unmasked, he became . the subject of magazine articles, true crime books and TV movies that . sought to explore his bizarre story and get to the heart of the man . behind the pseudonyms. The resulting publicity led California . authorities to revisit the Sohus disappearance. They realized the man in . custody in Boston was not an heir to the Rockefeller fortune but was . the man who had lived in San Marino decades ago. Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter, 52, was accused of bludgeoning his landlady's adult son with a blunt object and then digging a 3-foot-deep grave in the backyard of the victimís home . Ellen Sohus, sister of John Sohus whose remains were unearthed in San Marino, California in 1985, speaks to the press after Christian Karl Gerhartsreiter of Germany was found guilty of first degree murder in Los Angeles . A photo of swimming pool area being unearthed 1994 and finding the remains of John Sohus in the backyard of a home on Loraine Road in San Marino, California . Already serving . time for the kidnapping of his young daughter in a Boston custody . dispute, Gerhartsreiter was close to the end of his sentence and headed . for freedom when the murder charge changed that. After a quarter . century, authorities believed they had linked him to the disappearance . of his old neighbor, Sohus. Defense attorneys suggested that Linda . Sohus, not their client, killed her husband. But no motive was offered . for her or Gerhartsreiter to have killed the young man. Prosecutors . filled in the blanks of the defendant’s whereabouts during the decades . of his disappearance. But some details were unlikely ever to be . explained. He chose not to testify in his own defense and much of . the trial testimony came from people now hobbled by age who knew him in . San Marino as Chris Chichester, a stranger with a murky past. Yesterday, prosecutor Habib . Balian told the jury that Christian Gerhartsreiter murdered John Sohus . in San Marino 28 years ago and said that all the evidence they needed to . convict him was there. 'This . isn't a movie, a book, a TV show, a docudrama,' the Deputy District . Attorney said in his closing argument, referring to the fact that the . case has been turned into all of those things over the years. 'This case is about two people who lived and died,' Balian said. Gerhartsreiter is on trial in California, U.S. for the 1985 murder of John Sohus, who disappeared from his home in San Marino with his wife, Linda . Defendant . Christian Gerhartsreiter was charged only with the murder of Mr Sohus in . suburban San Marino, but the prosecutor was allowed to say he . believes Gerhartsreiter also killed Mr Sohus' wife, who remains missing . after nearly three decades. 'She's . dead', Balian said repeatedly as he described the disappearance of . Linda Sohus and her husband, John - newlyweds he said had no reason to . vanish. The . bones of John Sohus were unearthed in the backyard of his mother's . former house in San Marino a decade after he and his wife disappeared. He was found to have died from multiple fractures to the skull, probably . caused by a blunt instrument such as a baseball bat. Gerhartsreiter . lived as a tenant on the property in 1984 and 1985, but called himself . Chris Chichester then. He vanished around the same time the couple . disappeared in 1985, according to witnesses. As part of his closing argument, Balian used a Powerpoint presentation that showed pieces of a jigsaw puzzle falling into place. Balian predicted that the defense would seek to paint Linda Sohus as the murderer of her husband. Previously the trial heard from Gerhartsreiter's ex-wife Sandra Boss, right, to whom he lied about who he was . 'They're going to . batter her over and over and say she was the mastermind,' Balian said in . his presentation. 'But all the evidence in this case is going to point . you to the fact that only one person was the mastermind. ... He is . charged with murder.' However, . defense attorney Jeffrey Denner was less demeaning of Linda Sohus than . he was of his own client. He said Gerhartsreiter, a German immigrant, . was a white-collar criminal with a long list of offenses including . identity theft and immigration fraud. 'Over . a period of time in this country, he committed a lot of crimes with . which he was never charged', Denner said. 'It's no wonder he would want . to stay under the radar.' But the lawyer said his client had not been running from a murder investigation. The defendant, seen here with pen in his hand, took copious notes as the prosecutor summed up the case against him . Denner noted that . no trace evidence was scientifically connected to the defendant, and he . suggested it was more likely that Linda Sohus had a 'dark side' of her . life that led her to kill her husband. But he offered no evidence to . support that contention. 'That's . the stuff that reasonable doubt is made of', he told jurors. 'You don't . know what happened. If you don't know what happened, you can't convict . anybody.' Balian noted that Monday was the 28th anniversary of the day Linda and John Sohus were reported missing. 'What do we do with a case 28 years old?' he said, acknowledging there are no eye witnesses or physical evidence in the case. 'Circumstantial evidence is just as powerful', Balian said as he detailed the pieces of his puzzle. 'Not . only does he flee, he changes his identity and discontinues contacts . with friends. Why? Because he's a murderer', the prosecutor said. Eventually, . Gerhartsreiter turned up on the East Coast using the name Clark . Rockefeller and living well at the expense of his wealthy wife. Gerhartsreiter was previously prosecuted for kidnapping his own daughter and is serving a prison sentence for that crime. Defense . lawyers have suggested that he lived a life of pretense, making up wild . stories about royal lineage, but they say he never killed anyone. 'He . lied at will and his life was based on that', Denner said. 'He said he . was a filmmaker and he could amend the script anytime he wanted.' Gerhartsreiter was previously accused of kidnapping his own daughter Reigh, above, in 2009 . Balian reminded . jurors of testimony by former friends from San Marino. A woman . remembered seeing dirt in his yard where a large hole had been dug. A . forensic expert said traces of blood were found on the concrete floor . beneath a rug in the guest cottage the defendant occupied, bt it was . never clear if the blood was human or animal, and it was not linked to . Gerhartsreiter. The . prosecutor also emphasized what was found in the backyard grave along . with bones - plastic shopping bags from the University of Southern . California and University of Wisconsin at Milwaukee, two colleges the . defendant attended. 'The case is easy', said Balian. 'The evidence is right in front of your eyes.' The only thing missing, he acknowledged was a motive. Why would the defendant kill John Sohus? 'The . prosecution need not prove why', he said. 'It's not part of our burden . of proof. Nor do we need to prove the type of weapon used or where he . was killed.' Superior Court Judge George Lomeli instructed jurors . that if they cannot agree on the charge of first-degree murder, they . have the option of considering second-degree murder, which does not . require premeditation. He told jurors to return Tuesday for Balian's rebuttal before the start of their deliberations. Accused: Christian Gerhartsreiter is accused of the 1985 murder of John Sohus .

"By . Matt Chorley, Mailonline Political Editor . PUBLISHED: . 10:40 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 11:03 EST, 11 April 2013 . David Cameron today vowed to step up his plans to rein in welfare spending, claiming some people are ‘swinging the lead’ by refusing to work. The Prime Minister dismissed complaints that benefits reforms would worsen the north-south divide, insisting the problem could not be addressed with ‘larger and larger increases in the welfare bill’. And Mr Cameron defended his claim that the case of Mike Philpott, who started a fire which killed six of his own children, raised wider questions about ‘what’s happened without our welfare system’. David Cameron today vowed to press ahead with reforms to the welfare system, insisting too many people refused to make the effort to get a job . A study suggested changes to state handouts would take almost £19 billion-a-year out of the UK economy and hit northern England hardest. Academics at Sheffield Hallam University said people in the Lancashire resort town of Blackpool will lose out more than anywhere else in Britain. Former industrial areas including Middlesbrough, Liverpool and Glasgow would also be disproportionately affected. But Mr Cameron insisted the government was right to act to curb welfare spending, claiming too many people refused to work. He told Sky News: ‘We ask people what’s become unfair about Britain, they will say what is unfair is I’m working hard, but there are people who are swinging the lead on welfare, there are people who are not making the effort.’ Pay rises for people had been outstripped by increases in benefits, the Prime Minister added. The Prime Minister took part in a Q&A session with employees of energy company E.ON as part of a tour of the West Midlands . ‘If you look back over the last five years, people on out of work benefits have seen their incomes go up by 20 per cent whereas people in work have seen their incomes only go up by 10 per cent. ‘That’s because so many people in work have had no pay rise, they’ve had a freeze. ‘Some people have had to take a pay cut, and that’s why the decision we took to say that the key in-work benefits were only going to go up by 1%, that’s so important. Because it’s an issue of fairness. ‘You shouldn’t be better off out of work with a bigger increase in your benefits than you are in work, working hard.’ The Sheffield Hallam University study suggested people in wealthier areas, predominantly in the South, such as Cambridge, Surrey and the Cotswolds, will see the smallest financial losses. Jobless father-of-17 Mick Philpott was jailed for life for killing six of his children in a house fire . Researchers assessed the financial impact of changes made by the coalition to housing benefit - including the so-called bedroom tax on public housing tenants who have unused rooms - disability living allowance, child benefit, tax credits, council tax benefit and several other hand-outs. Professor Steve Fothergill, from Sheffield Hallam's Centre for Regional Economic and Social Research, led the study, which was based on a range of official statistics. He said: ‘A key effect of the welfare reforms will be to widen the gaps in prosperity between the best and worst local economies across Britain. ‘Our figures also show the coalition Government is presiding over national welfare reforms that will impact principally on individuals and communities outside its own political heartlands.’ Generally, the more deprived the local authority, the greater the financial impact, Prof Fothergill found. He said the three regions of northern England - the North West, North East and Yorkshire and Humberside - can expect to lose a total of £5.2 billion a year in benefit income. Much of the south and east of England outside London escapes comparatively lightly. But Mr Cameron said: ‘Labour tested to destruction the idea that simply through larger and larger increases in the welfare bill you can heal the north-south divide – you can’t. ‘What Labour did is create a more welfare dependent country. We need a smaller state and a bigger private sector. ‘I want us to be a fair country, but fairness is principally about if you work hard, do the right thing, are you treated fairly by the system?’ Mr Cameron also defended his decision to link the arson case of Mike Philpott to the need to reform the benefits system. Philpott, a father of 17, was jailed for life last week for the manslaughter of six of his children after setting fire to the family home in Derby. His wife Mairead and accomplice Paul Mosley were each jailed for 17 years. Mr Cameron said: 'First and foremost, and this is absolutely key, we have to hold Mr Philpott responsible for his crimes. 'Personal, individual responsibility, that is absolutely vital. But does this case lead to a wider debate about what’s happened with our welfare system, the signals it sends, yes, I think there is that debate. 'I made a speech some months ago pointing out a whole series of reforms that we could consider in terms of working age welfare to make sure that the welfare system is sending the signal that it supports people who work hard and the welfare shouldn’t be a lifestyle choice. 'We do need to have a debate in this country about this issue, it shouldn’t be a lifestyle choice.'","Prime Minister dismisses claim cuts will worsen north-south divide .

Chief executive Marc Bolland (pictured with Rosie Huntington-Whiteley) will be forced out unless he can engineer a recovery, say analysts . Healthy food sales have helped rescue Marks & Spencer from a disastrous start to the year as the store’s fashion and general merchandise continues to decline. The popularity of the ‘5:2 diet’, which requires followers to restrict what they eat two days a week, helped sales of the store’s Count on Us range, which offers meals at fewer than 400 calories. These products enjoyed a rise of up to 65 per cent in the first three months of this year. Overall, food sales were up by 4 per cent – which helped to off-set a 3.8 per cent fall on fashion and general merchandise. The net effect was that total like-for-like sales excluding changes in store space were up 0.6 per cent in the 13 weeks to March 30. However, fashion lines continue to disappoint younger women, who have defected to cheaper rivals such as Primark, Zara and H&M. Fashion and merchandise have now shown annual falls for almost two years, leaving M&S at risk of losing its crown as Britain’s biggest fashion retailer, and even surrounded by rumours of a takeover. City analysts say chief executive Marc Bolland, hired from supermarket chain Morrisons with a multi-million pound golden hello, will be forced out unless he can engineer a recovery. M&S has drafted in former Debenhams and Jaeger boss Belinda Earl to revitalise womenswear – as well as a publicity campaign fronted by supermodel Rosie Huntington-Whiteley – but it is still too early to judge Miss Earl’s impact on ranges, which are not due in stores until the summer. By contrast, the food division has delivered more than three years of growth, with the most recent quarter benefiting from its best ever Easter week. p 27 graphic.jpg . It now makes up 55 per cent of M&S sales, with clothing and merchandise at 45 per cent. Last year the chain took some £4.7billion through food tills and £4.2billion on fashion and home products. The 5:2 weight-loss technique requires dieters to restrict themselves two non-consecutive days a week to 500 calories or 600 for men, and eat normally on the other five days. M&S dishes such as the 380-calorie Green Thai Curry and 340-calorie chilli bowl fit in with the regime, and saw a rise in sales of 65 per cent and 58 per cent respectively. There was also a 54 per cent rise in sales of packs of low-calorie vegetable stir fries. Healthy meals product developer Elaine Kessler said: ‘We’re delighted with the impact on sales.’ Food sales were also bolstered by the fact M&S had no connection to the horsemeat scandal. The figures led to shares rising by 4 per cent in early trading yesterday. However, overall annual group profits are expected to fall for the second year in a row when M&S reports results later this spring. It follows a grim 2011, when profits fell for the first time in three years, to £705.9million. James McGregor, of retail consultants Retail Remedy, said: ‘General merchandise is clearly still struggling but these numbers will buy Marc Bolland a few more months. Judgement day for him  will come later this year.’ Sales slunmp: Marks & Spencer said sales in its clothing and homeware division fell for the seventh straight quarter.","Women have defected to cheaper rivals such as Primark, Zara and H&M .

Libel lawyer and Tory MP Sir Edward Garnier has put down amendments to the Government's Defamation Bill that would remove key sections designed to boost freedom of speech . Plans to reform Britain’s ‘chilling’ libel laws to prevent businesses and politicians silencing their critics risk being derailed. Libel lawyer and Tory MP Sir Edward Garnier has put down amendments to the Government’s Defamation Bill that would remove key sections designed to boost freedom of speech. The legislation currently states that companies must show that financial damage was caused by something written by a journalist, academic or blogger, before they can sue for libel. Campaigners say the clause is vital to protect the interests of scientists and writers who have been muzzled by big business and drug firms under the threat that they might face ruinous damages. Sir Edward, a former Solicitor General, wants to strip that protection out of the Bill. He has also put down an amendment to remove a clause that prevents anybody performing ‘a public function’ from suing. That is seen by libel reform campaigners as a vital protection enshrining in law the freedom to criticise town hall chiefs. Sir Edward’s move, if successful, could allow councillors to bully cash-strapped local newspapers and deter negative coverage of their activities and use of public money. Lib Dem peer Lord Lester said: ‘My view is that it is extremely important that this clause ought to be preserved. Local authorities, like national authorities, cannot sue for reputation.’ Robert Sharp, of English PEN, another group calling for change to protect freedom of speech, said both subclauses were essential ‘to stop the inequality of arms that corporations use’. Sir Edward’s amendments will be debated in the Commons next Tuesday but the Government hopes to defeat them.

But actually bemused visitors are witnessing a one in 100,000 occurrence where non-albino wallaby Monica, gave birth to an albino joey. Meanwhile Emily, an albino wallaby, gave birth to a brown joey. Emily the albino wallaby (left) gave birth to a brown joey, while Monica (right) gave birth to an albino joey . The chances of a non-albino wallaby like Monica giving birth to an albino joey are one in 100,000 . Zoo keeper, John Ray, said: ‘It is extremely rare to see two parents like this in captivity and as far as I am aware it has never been recorded in the wild. ‘The Joeys are the size of a bean when they are first born and the gestation period is only thirty days. ‘When you start to see their heads out of the pouch they are between three to four months old and they stay in the pouch for nine months.

Spring flower sellers have had to throw away £50million worth of stock because of the prolonged winter weather that has hit Britain. Freezing conditions have stopped people from tending to their gardens which would normally be filled with colourful plants bought from garden centres. Due to the lack of demand, independent growers and nurseries have been unable to sell on their stock to stores like B&Q and Homebase. Ditched: A truckload of spring flowers are dumped by the Blue Ribbon nursery near Chichester, Hampshire, because the weather has caused a huge slump in demand . Waste: Walter Back, 70, said it has been the worst spring he can remember in 50 years of growing flowers . Thrown out: Some flower retailers are likely to go to the wall because the harsh spring weather has seen sales slump . They are now having to make room for their summer flowers like geraniums, petunias and begonias and have no choice but to bin spring plants such as pansies, primroses and violas by the lorry load. After weeks of bad weather that has kept gardeners inside, forecasters expect spring to finally arrive next week. Temperatures could hit 20C on Sunday and it is likely to remain warm for the following few days. The warmest day of the year so far was March 6 when it was 17.5C in Trawscoed, Wales, but that should be topped this weekend. Met Office forecaster Charlie Powell said that after a mild Sunday, we will finally get a spell of spring weather. 'We won't quite see temperatures of 17, 18 or 19C on Monday but temperatures are still going to be in the mid-teens. It will be something a bit more average for the time of year,' he said. 'It will also be warmer at night so we won't see any return to freezing conditions. There will be some decent spells of sunshine but some showers here and there across the south and west of England and Wales. Three-day forecast: The weather is set to remain wet into the weekend - but on Sunday it will improve and temperatures could hit 20C . On an episode of Gardener's World last month, Monty Don urged viewers not to hurry into their gardens. He said: 'There's no great hurry to sow seed, so don't panic' 'The winds will start to ease and everywhere should be in double figures. 'Tuesday is likely to be cloudy away from the south-east with some rain but nothing heavy.' But the improvement in the weather will come too late for Britain's flower retailers who will have to dump an estimated 30million individual plants because of the bad start to the year. The British Protected Ornamentals Association (BPOA) which represents 170 plant growers in the UK, say that on average each member has lost nearly £300,000 worth of plants. It is a 'double whammy' for nurseries that have also had to pay more in energy bills to heat their huge greenhouses to keep the spring flowers alive for as long as possible. It is feared some growers will be forced out of business by the end of the year even if the sun does come out. There may be more bleak news for growers . in years to come because forecasters warned that Britain's winters are . getting colder because of melting Arctic ice changing global weather . patterns. Late bloom: Alan Shipp, 74, is pictured in his field of Hyacinths, which are finally beginning to burst into flower, much later than in recent years due to the cold weather earlier in the year . Finally flowering: Mr Shipp has been growing hyacinths since the end of World War Two and has 190 varieties on his farm . Figures released yesterday revealed that the temperature in . Aberdeenshire fell to -11.2 degrees Celsius on April 2 – this is the . lowest recorded April temperature for almost 100 years. Met Office climate change expert Dr Julia Slingo is concerned that shrinking sea ice in the Arctic could be responsible. ‘If this is how climate change could manifest itself, then we need to understand that as a matter of urgency,’ she told ITV News. Revelations that planters are facing a bleak spring come after the BBC's Monty Don became embroiled in row with the gardening industry after he recently told viewers of Gardener's World to delay planting until the weather improved. Rubbish: Another truck load of flowers are dumped. An estimated 30million will have to be thrown out nationwide, hitting independent retailers hard . Thrown away: Flower sales have been hit because March was the coldest on record for over 50 years, with an average temperature across the country of just 2.2C . The presenter's statement upset garden centre retailers, who said the advice hampered their sales figures during the spring months. March was the coldest on record for over 50 years, with an average temperature across the country of just 2.2C. Ian Riggs, chairman of the BPOA, said the cold weather has affected growers both big and small. He said: 'Because of the cold weather there have been very low sales of spring plants at garden centres across the country. 'People have just not stepped out into their gardens to fill their borders and pots with primroses and pansies this spring because it has been so cold. Stock clearout: Blue Ribbon Plants, run by Walter Black with his wife Anja and son Robert, has thrown out nearly £100,000 worth of spring plants . Wasted: Spring stock is being thrown out to make way for summer stock after low sales in the first four months of the year . 'The problem is growers would normally have cleared their glass houses of spring plants by now, leaving room for the summer plants. 'But because sales have been incredibly low all of the spring plants are still there. 'They are having to literally bin millions of perfectly good plants that are now in full colour and this dumping has been going on on a large scale across the country. 'It is a double-whammy to the industry because growers are losing money from lack of sales and have also paid more in energy costs to keep those plants in green houses. 'We estimate losses to growers across the country could total around £50million. Last year was bad enough because of the wet summer, but this is a much bigger blow. 'Even if everything went well and our members sold 100 per cent of their summer stock, this year can't be rescued because that income and profit just cannot be recovered. Waste: Independent growers would usually sell their stock to stores like B&Q and Homebase but demand has been down because of the weather . Sea of waste: Mr Back called for garden centres to shoulder some of the cost of the losses in the future . Waste: Mr Back said 'It is incredibly frustrating to have to throw away perfectly good, beautiful flowers' 'I fear some of the businesses may not be with us this time next year. There are some growers who will decide to call it a day.' At one nursery in Chichester, West Sussex, owner Walter Back watched helplessly as lorry-load after lorry-load of beautiful primroses were dumped on to a large pile of perfectly healthy plants that will be turned to compost. Mr Back, 70, who runs Blue Ribbon Plants with his wife Anja and son Robert, has thrown out nearly £100,000 worth of spring plants. He said it has been the toughest time he has experienced since he went into business 51 years ago. Mr Back said: 'It's been a terrible year and the worst I can remember since starting out in 1962. It is the worst I have seen it for such a sustained period of time. 'We've had 12 months of terrible weather. There won't be any businesses left the way it has been going. 'It is incredibly frustrating to have to throw away perfectly good, beautiful flowers.' Rubbish: Although the weather is set to improve this weekend, it will come too late for Britain's plant growers who are being forced to ditch stock that hasn't sold because of the dismal start to the year . Rubbish: These plants are all destined for the bin because they have not sold . He called for garden centres to shoulder some of the cost of the losses in the future. He said: 'At the moment if the garden centres decide they don't want to buy the plants - which they tell us beforehand that they want - they don't have to pay anything at all and we are left out of pocket. 'It would be much fairer if the cost was shared 50/50.' He added: 'The weather seems to be turning now so I just hope it will start to take off.' On an episode of Gardener's World broadcast last month, Monty Don urged viewers not to hurry into their gardens. He said: 'There's no great hurry to sow seed, so don't panic. Don't be in a hurry. You don't have to sow anything at all until April.' Industry experts said Mr Don's comments were inaccurate and wrong. Peter Burks, chairman of the Garden Centre Association, said: 'People who don't know that much about gardening will listen to Monty's comments and wrongly assume they can't plant anything until April - which is not the case. 'There are many plants, such as shrubs, roses and trees, that can be planted well before April, even through the winter and into autumn.'","Independent plant growers could go out of business due to prolonged winter weather .

In Iraq's national museum, home to some of the world's most precious artefacts of ancient Mesopotamia, a caption beside a skeleton simply reads in English: 'dated to very old time.' And some of the museum's most impressive pieces carry no labels at all - like a giant stone head lying on the ground that may or may not belong on a nearby empty pedestal labelled 'Assyrian King Nimrod,' the Biblical tormentor of the patriarch Abraham. Ten years after Iraq's national museum was looted and smashed by thieves during the US-led invasion in 2003 to topple Saddam Hussein, it is still far from ready to reopen to the public. A sign next to a skeleton in Iraq's national museum says it is 'dated to very old time'. The staff face the problem of not having enough background about the museum's collection and an incomplete inventory . Ten years after the US invasion, the national museum is still not ready to reopen to the public . Only Iraqi students and officials or foreign delegations are able to visit the museum by prior arrangement . Among the treasures that survived the looting is this lion, symbolising Ishtar, the goddess of love and war. The panel came from the Ishtar gate, Babylon and dates back to the reign of Nebuchadnezzar II from 605-562BC . Work to overcome decades of neglect and the destruction of war has been hindered by power struggles, poorly-skilled staff and the persistent violence plaguing the country, said Bahaa Mayah, Iraq's most senior antiquities official. 'I wish that the great historical Baghdad would appear in her finest face and that the Iraq museum opens,' said Mayah, the head of antiquities in the Tourism and Antiquities Ministry. 'But our wishes crash against the unfortunate reality we live in.' The museum was once the showcase for 7,000 years of history in Mesopotamia, birthplace of some of the first cities and one of the first writing systems - cuneiform - and home to a succession of major civilisations, including the Sumerian, Babylonian and Assyrian, through to a flourishing Islamic empire. The museum was left a wreck the day after Baghdad fell to US troops on April 10, 2003. Ancient clay scrolls and pottery littered the floor. Looters made off with everything from gold bowls and ritual funeral masks to elaborate headdresses. The US was sharply criticised for not protecting the museum. Recovered statues from the 2003 looting . Because the museum's inventory was never completed, it is uncertain how many pieces were stolen, but the number is estimated at 15,000 pieces. More than a quarter have been retrieved, said Mayah, who has overseen the museum formally since 2012 but has been involved in its renovations for the past five years. Work began soon after the museum was smashed up in 2003, starting with the basics, such as computers, office furniture, air conditioning. By mid-2004, the museum was rewired for electricity and most basic repairs to its structure completed. Since then, the US and Italian governments have helped renovate the halls. But work has been slow. Only five of . 30 exhibition halls have been renovated so far - and two of those have . to be done again because they were improperly done. As . a result, the museum is still not open to the general public. Its only . visitors are specially arranged foreign delegations, Iraqi officials and . field trips by Iraqi students. It is . part of a broader problem of preservation of antiquities in Iraq. There . are over 12,000 registered archaeological sites in Iraq but they are . mostly not protected, allowing for widespread, ongoing looting, Mayah told the Associated Press. The museum itself . was shut from the early 1990s by regime officials who said they . feared for its safety, as Saddam mired the country in war, leading to . crippling sanctions. The . closure meant the museum's inventory wasn't updated. Sanctions meant . staff couldn't update their skills, and many qualified employees left . amid an exodus of Iraqis from the country. Tens of thousands of artefacts chronicling some 7,000 years of civilisation in Mesopotamia are believed to have been looted from Iraq in the chaos which followed the US-led invasion ten years ago . Despite international efforts, fewer than half of the missing artefacts have so far been found and returned to the museum . Objects in the museum include this cosmetic container carved from stone, found near Ur . Statues from the ninth century Kingdom of Nimrod are among the works still in the museum's possession . In a central Baghdad quarter, the museum is surrounded by high concrete blast walls. Guards check bags in a caravan set up in the neglected museum garden. The main entrance is under construction, so visitors enter through a corridor leading to administrative rooms. An Associated Press reporter said the renovated exhibition halls were eerily quiet, with gleaming floors and shining display cases, the artefacts encased neatly inside. The sound of workers employing drills was palpable as they renovated another hall. A ladder was strewn under a map of ancient Mesopotamia. Fewer than half of the 15,000 stolen objects have been found and returned . Two of the renovated rooms are meant to showcase the Sumerian civilization, which emerged some 3,000 years ago. But the labels on the artefacts shed little light on the antiquities that represent some of humankind's most important milestones. Many labels lacked the age of the artefact, where it was found, what civilisation it belonged to, or what its use was. Some didn't have labels at all. Nowhere in the hall - or anywhere else - is it explained who the Sumerians were or how they influenced later civilisations. In one of the displays lay a skeleton in the earth it was found in, alongside rings and jars. A printed label beside it read: 'A human skeleton found in situ, put beside him some jars and rings between him dated to very old time.' The label on a fist-sized figurine of a monkey clutching his ears simply identifies it as 'some monkey.' A hand-sized stone carving in one display case was described as 'the legendary hero Gilgamesh wrestling with two lions, early 3rd millennium,' with no further explanation of who Gilgamesh was - the Sumerian hero-king of one of the first written stories in history. UK-based Iraqi archaeologist Lamia . al-Gailani, who is following the renovations, said labels were lacking . because the outdated inventory didn't list the pieces and the staff, . lacking expertise, weren't familiar with the pieces' background. A . US State Department official advising on the renovation said it was . better to display the pieces imperfectly than keep them hidden. But . more problematic and confusing, is that the displays in the Sumerian . halls mix in artefacts from the later Babylonian era, as well as from . the Neanderthals, an entirely different hominid species from homo . sapiens that died out some 30,000 years ago. Mayah . said the two halls would be renovated again this year. Sometime this . year, he hopes, all the finished halls can be opened to the general . public. Other renovated halls fared better. Displays in the hall on Baghdad's Islamic dynasty were clear. Another hall explained the significance of the 5,000 year-old Arab city of Hatra, adorned with rare statues. The items still under the museum's care include this Bronze Age carved stone vessel found in the Ur area . Other treasures include a limestone slab depicting the water god, Ea, receiving a minor deity . Stone figures depicting the family of Sanatruq I, the king of Hatra, found at the site of the ancient city . Another find from Hatra, this limestone statue of a cloaked woman . The museum's prize is the soaring Assyrian hall, chronicling the kingdom that rose to become a major empire in the region in the 2nd and 1st millennia B.C. The hall is lined with stone etchings of giant winged creatures and statues of hand-clasped Assyrian kings. Yet even here, at the hall's rear, lay the unidentified broken stone head the size of an exercise ball, bearded and wearing a crown. Nearby stood an empty pedestal labeled for a statue of Nimrod. 'Even the renovations that have been done are disappointing. I won't compare it to the great museums of the world, but still - it's way behind,' said a UN adviser to the museum who spoke anonymously, not wishing to offend local staff. Turf battles over the museum haven't helped. The culture ministry and tourism ministry both claimed authority over the museum in 2005, confusing staff and delaying renovations. The body that directly oversees the museum - the State Antiquities Authority - was leaderless from 2006 onwards. In 2012, the Iraqi parliament finally definitively put the museum under the tourism ministry. Ongoing . violence, particularly suicide bombings hitting Baghdad during most of . the past ten years, has also kept away foreign experts who could have . helped speed the process, said al-Gailani. The violence also means tourists are staying away from Iraq, reducing the incentive for staff to speed up renovations. One US official said it was better for the museum to display the items with imperfect details rather than hide them away . If the museum had stayed closed, more than 7,000 years of Mesopotamian history would be hidden from the world . Although Iraq is relatively safer since the height of violence in 2007, there are still frequent attacks against government institutions, mostly the hallmark of al Qaeda. Ultimately, the museum didn't have to be world-class, said al-Gailani. 'The antiquities are so unique and rich, sometimes you forget if they are exhibited well or not,' she said. The museum's woes mattered little to a visiting group of Iraqi schoolgirls. They rushed into the room, gaping at the statues, taking notes. 'It's not like television,' said Sawsan Kadhim, 19. 'Now if somebody says something about our history, I can say I saw it in reality.'","The museum was looted of 15,000 pieces during the US-led war .

Slain West Virginia Sheriff Eugene Crum was remembered Sunday for his warmth, kindness and dedication to tackling Mingo County's pervasive drug problems. Hundreds of mourners, including nearly 400 law enforcement officers from several states, packed Mingo Central High School for Crum's funeral. The 59-year-old sheriff was shot to death Wednesday, a little more than three months after taking office. Sheriffs escort Rosie Crum into the Mingo Central High School gym for a memorial for late husband Mingo County Sheriff Eugene Crum who was gunned down just after three months in office . Members of the honor guard carry Crum's body following his memorial, where he was remembered for his warmth, kisses and dedication to his job . Cabell County Sheriff Tom McComas, left, presents Rosie Crum an American flag during burial services for her late husband . 'We ask all the time where have all the heroes gone?' Mingo County Circuit Judge Michael Thornsbury said during his eulogy. 'Let me tell you, sometimes we walk in their midst and we don't know we got them. He was mine.' Although county Prosecutor Michael Sparks has said there's no substantial evidence that Crum's death was drug-related, Thornsbury said Crum had received threats due to his job. 'He was aware he was being persecuted by some, but the saving grace was that he knew he was loved by many.' The last conversation Thornsbury had with Crum included those job risks and occurred just a few minutes before his death. 'He looked at me and he said, ""I'm going to fight the good fight,'"" Thornsbury said. And with that, Crum left for lunch. He was shot as he ate in a downtown Williamson parking lot. Police charged 37-year-old Tennis Melvin Maynard with murder and the motive is still unclear. Thornsbury recalled the day he went looking for Crum more than a decade ago when the judge needed to find a chief magistrate. Rosie Crum, who was sworn in as her husband's replacement on Thursday, listens to a 'Final Call' over the radio honoring her late husband . He tracked down Crum at a bowling alley and swore him into office right there. Crum stepped down as magistrate in January 2012 in order to seek the sheriff's job. Before winning that job, he was appointed by the prosecutor's office last August as a special investigator for drug enforcement. Thornsbury said under Crum's short watch as sheriff, the county saw 57 felony convictions, and state Delegate Harry Keith White, who campaigned with Crum last year, said there were more indictments under Crum than the county had seen in the past eight years. Thornsbury said Crum loved going to Mingo Central football games with his grandson, hanging out with family at his backyard pool and going fishing during the summer on his pontoon boat. But his dream was to unite the sheriff's department. 'It was his destiny,' Thornsbury said. 'When you think about it, many of us don't get the chance to live our dreams. He did.' Thornsbury said Crum went after drug dealers and buyers 'not for the glory of arrests but because, he said, ""I've been to too many funeral homes. I've been to too many wakes. I've seen too many crying families. I've seen too many lost."" 'He wanted to do something about it. He wanted to rid the scourge.' County Commission President John Mark Hubbard said Crum wanted to make a difference, and he did. 'And shame on anyone in this room within the sound of my voice who will not make sure that the change that this man laid his life down for does not continue,' Hubbard said, drawing loud applause. In between speakers and while a hymn was being sung, Rosie Crum walked to her husband's open casket, stroking his head. A U.S. flag was draped over part of the casket, surrounded by dozens of colorful flower arrangements. She was appointed interim sheriff the day after his death. 'We need to stand behind her, we need help her and we need to fight for her,' said the Rev. Paul Caudill, a family friend.

'Goodbye to our hero,"" read a sign made by Cindy McClanahan and her two grandsons as they waited for Crum's hearse. 'He helped everybody he knew,' McClanahan said.

Hundreds of thousands of people could struggle to watch Freeview television programmes next week because of tests to assess the impact of new 4G mobile phone networks. At least 170,000 households and businesses in southeast London are being warned their digital TV signal could be disrupted on Monday because of the trial. They could lose some or all Freeview channels and experience loss of sound or blurred images. Hundreds of thousands of people could struggle to watch Freeview television programmes next week because of tests to assess the impact of new 4G mobile phone networks . With the switch-over of TV services to digital, a band of frequencies previously used by TV is being made available for phone firms to offer high speed 4G services. In certain circumstances, it is possible that new 4G services at 800 MHz could interfere with some existing terrestrial digital TV signals, meaning viewers will need to fit a filter or, in around 40,000 cases, use cable or satellite providers. People in parts of Greenwich, Lewisham, Southwark and Tower Hamlets are being alerted to the test. Hospitals, care homes, schools and businesses have been issued with advice on how to avoid any problems, while further arrangements are being made to support vulnerable people during the trial. The test follows a smaller pilot in the West Midlands where people living in 22,000 homes were warned they could experience interference last month. On that occasion, only 15 households reported problems with television reception caused by 4G, as opposed to the predicted 120. The trials are being conducted by at800, a firm tasked with ensuring viewers continue to receive free-to-air television when 4G broadband is switched on at 800 MHz this summer. Simon Beresford-Wylie, chief executive of at800, said: ‘These larger tests are essential to help improve our forecast model and the way we'll tackle potential issues caused by 4G at 800 MHz. ‘We are extremely grateful to viewers in south-east London for their help with these important tests.’ At least 170,000 households and businesses in southeast London are being warned their digital TV signal could be disrupted on Monday because of the trial . Viewers in the area have been asked to report problems with television reception from Monday. Teams will be placed on stand-by to respond to calls and restore Freeview services if they break down. Viewing issues could arise because the high-speed mobile phone service at 800 MHz, and digital television, operate in adjacent parts of the radio spectrum. Therefore, equipment that receives television signals - such as aerials, amplifiers, and digital tuners - can fail to block 4G at this frequency. Satellite and cable TV services are unlikely to be affected by 4G at 800 MHz. Anyone in the south-east London area with Freeview disruption on Monday is asked to call at800 on 0333 31 31 800. Those at risk of interference from 4G services will be contacted directly by post. 200,000 watts of lighting illuminate the 219 metre tall Crystal Palace broadcast tower, as part of Arqiva's 'Switch Over Night'.

The daughter of a West Virginia sheriff gunned down while sitting in his patrol car believes there's a 'strong possibility' he was killed because of his dedicated fight against drugs. Mingo County Sheriff Walter Crum took office only three months before he was shot at point-blank range on Wednesday while eating lunch in his marked vehicle. 'My dad fought tirelessly against drug abuse. He just wanted to clean up the county and make it a better place to live,' his daughter, Julie Hall, told CNN on Saturday.

Crum had a reputation for targeting drug dealers, a campaign promise those who knew him say he worked to uphold. Police say 37-year-old Tennis Melvin Maynard shot Crum while he was parked in a place he usually took his lunches. It was a witness' 911 call offering Maynard's license plate number that rushed a sheriff's deputy to the scene. After a high-speed chase, the suspect crashed his SUV. When he got out and pulled a handgun, the deputy fired, leading to the suspect's hospitalization. Because he is heavily medicated authorities say his statements have remained inconsistent.

The . courthouse was immediately evacuated, streets into the city were . blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene, . Crum's body further shielded by two vehicles. The shooting occurred within a block of the county courthouse, said Office of Emergency Services head dispatcher Willis Spence. Crum had resigned his post as a county magistrate before launching his sheriff's campaign as a signal of integrity, preferring to run as a civilian rather than an official, White said. He won the primarily handily and ran unopposed in the general election in the fall. Crum had been a magistrate for 12 years and had previously served as police chief in Delbarton. White said Crum was dedicated to improving the community and devoted to his grandchildren and adult children. 'He always had family around him,' he said. After dozens of indictments were issued earlier this year, Prosecutor Michael Sparks issued a press release declaring that Crum 'exceeded my highest expectations' and 'has provided a game changing boost to our drug enforcement program.' Crime scene: Law enforcement officers and emergency service personnel cover the vehicle at the scene of the shooting in downtown Williamson with one suspect in custody . Delegate Justin Marcum, D-Mingo and an assistant county prosecutor, called Crum 'a true friend to the county.' 'He'll be dearly missed,' he said. Williamson, a town of about 3,200, sits along the Tug Fork River in a part of the state long associated with violence. Mingo and neighboring McDowell County are home to the legendary blood feud between the Hatfield family of West Virginia and the McCoy family of Kentucky, a conflict dating to the Civil War. Crum's county was dubbed 'Bloody Mingo' during the early 20th century mine wars, when unionizing miners battled Baldwin-Felts security agents hired by the coal operators. In May 1920, after evicting striking miners in Red Jacket, some of the Baldwin-Felts men tried to board a train in nearby Matewan but were confronted by the mayor and the chief of police, Sid Hatfield, a former miner, who had family ties to the Hatfields in the feud. After a gun battle recreated in the 1987 John Sayles film 'Matewan,' the mayor, two miners, a bystander and three agents lay dead. Hatfield became a hero but was gunned down on the courthouse steps a year later in Matewan. Emergency response: The courthouse just one block away was evacuated, streets into the city were blocked off and officers held white sheets around the crime scene . Though there is no indication of a direct connection, Crum's killing comes on the heels of a Texas district attorney and his wife being shot to death in their home over the weekend, and officials suspect a white supremacist prison gang. Those killings happened a couple of months after 1 of the county's assistant district attorneys was killed near his courthouse office. Colorado's corrections director, Tom Clements, was killed March 19 when he answered the doorbell at his home outside Colorado Springs. Two days later, Evan Spencer Ebel, a white supremacist and former Colorado inmate suspected of shooting Clements, died in a shootout about 100 miles from Kaufman. On Monday, judicial officials acknowledged Ebel was freed four years early because of a paperwork error. U.S. Attorney Booth Goodwin called Crum's killing 'shocking' and said he's spoken to the State Police, which will lead the investigation. He pledged the assistance of his office and whatever other federal agencies are needed. Over the last century, 14 prosecutors have been killed, according to news reports and statistics kept by the National District Attorneys Association. At least 8 of them were targeted in the line of duty. The Officer Down Memorial Page says 197 police officers in West Virginia have died in the line of duty, 136 of them from deliberate gunfire.","Eugene Crum was known for cracking down on illegal drug trade in West Virginia's coalfields .

Shackled in chains, Peter Robbins pleaded not guilty at the San Diego Superior Court yesterday to two counts of stalking and 10 counts of making criminal threats. Prosecutors said the 56-year-old repeatedly threatened his former girlfriend, calling her as many as 37 times in a 24-hour period on her cellphone and telling her he would kill her and her son if she did not give back his dog and car. Scroll down for video . In the dock: Charlie Brown actor Peter Robbins appears for his arraignment at San Diego Superior Court where he pleaded not guilty to stalking his ex-girlfriend and the plastic surgeon who gave her a breast enhancement . Prosecutors said he also threatened the plastic surgeon in the coastal city of Carlsbad, calling her office so many times she moved to a hotel temporarily out of fear for her life and hired an armed guard outside her clinic. Authorities said Robbins paid for the breast enhancement and was demanding his money back after they broke up, according to the criminal complaint. On December 31, Robbins allegedly confronted his former girlfriend in a hotel room, beating his dog and telling her he would not stop hurting the animal and would kill her if she did not get a refund for the surgery, Deputy District Attorney Elizabeth McClutchey said. McClutchey said he then grabbed his ex-girlfriend by the neck and shoved her against the door before fleeing.

San Diego Superior Court Judge David M Szumowski agreed to up the bail from $50,000 to $550,000. Robbins was arrested on Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry after authorities doing a background check upon his return from Mexico spotted a warrant from the San Diego County Sheriff's Department.

Robbins was held on Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry (pictured) on the Mexican border after a background check yielded a warrant against him . He called him a 'distraught man' and said 'this is not a stalking case' but declined to comment on what led to his arrest. 'Mr Robbins is an eccentric individual,' Kohnen told reporters after the arraignment. 'He's not a threat to society.' If convicted, he would face a maximum sentence of up to nine years in prison, prosecutors said.

A 21-year-old 'heroin addict' has today been accused of conning friends and strangers into donating to her 'life-saving cancer treatment' when really she was completely healthy and using the cash 'to fund her drug habit'. Prosecutors claim Brittany Ozarowski of Selden, New York, carried out the elaborate scam for over a year claiming she had ovarian, stomach, brain and bone cancer, accepting numerous donations totaling more than $20,000. The former Newfield High School Student set up a donation website explaining how she was dying and needed help; a Facebook fundraising page and placed jars near the cash registers of businesses across Nassau and Suffolk County. Accused: Brittany Ozarowski, pictured, is alleged to have duped dozens into believing she was dying of cancer and convincing them to give her money . Sympathetic friends and strangers hosted fundraising events and appealed for others to come forward and support her. But in a press conference this afternoon, Suffolk District Attorney Thomas Spota said they had all been duped. 'It was a scam. There was no cancer, no chemo, and no radiation. The only thing that there was, was heroin and more heroin,' he said. On her own website, Ozarowski, claims her family have already liquidated all their assets to pay for her treatment. 'In September of 2011 I was diagnosed with stage two ovarian cancer as well as stomach cancer,' she writes. 'After multiple treatments of both radiation and chemotherapy I had beaten cancer as of December 2011.' 'Scam': The 21-year-old had a fundraising page online, left, where she claimed she had stomach, brain, bone and ovarian cancer. According to police, she used pictures taken after a car accident on the site, right . 'Scam': This jar was allegedly placed in several stores across Long Island by Ozarowski . 'I was cancer free until they had found a tumor on my left hip in February 2012. That is when I found out that I have bone cancer. ' 'The cancer has spread to my spine as well as my brain. So once again I was in need of radiation treatments as well as chemotherapy treatments.' 'This time the medicine was much more expensive and my family had already liquidated all assets since September.  The treatments are about $33,000 each day and although my doctor has been incredible with helping my family financially I am still short. I have very few options left and I am still in desperate need of treatments.' She now faces 24 charges, including forgery and petit larceny. Her arraignment has been postponed, but she is currently being held on $5,000 bail. Officers say she had a car accident over a year ago which left her with multiple broken bones. She was arrested for being under the influence of heroin and used the photographs of her sitting in a wheelchair and getting treatment to perpetuate her fake cancer story, officers claim.

The voice actor who portrayed Charlie Brown in the Peanuts shows has been arrested on charges of making threats to cause death and stalking, it emerged today. Peter Robbins was held on Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry, the largest land border crossing between San Diego and Tijuana, a U.S. Customs and Border Protection spokeswoman Angelica de Cima said. She told U-T San Diego that a background . check yielded a warrant against Robbins from the San Diego County . sheriff's department. A sheriff's spokeswoman said she did not have details about the warrant. The 56-year-old is set to be arraigned today on counts of making a threat to cause death or great bodily injury and of stalking. His manager has declined to comment. Robbins, who voiced Charlie Brown for TV specials A Charlie Brown Christmas and It's the Great Pumpkin, Charlie Brown, recently called the forthcoming Peanuts movie pointless and a 'horrible idea'. Speaking in October, he accused 20th Century Fox of lacking creativity and trying to steal the thunder of the original televised version of the popular cartoon. The new Peanuts film is expected to hit the silver screen in November 2015 with a screenplay written by the cartoon's creator Charles M Schulz's son and grandson. Scroll down for video . Robbins was held on Sunday at the San Ysidro Port of Entry (pictured) on the Mexican border after a background check yielded a warrant against him .

'If . it's to reintroduce the character of Charlie Brown to a new generation, . it's been passed on successfully for 46 years. That's the beauty of it. Comparing . the new flick to a 'knock-off band' he added: 'If they were so creative . why don't they come up with some new characters?

From pink mini Converse to stylish baby bomber jackets, children have long been outdoing their parents in the style stakes. And now children can take their trend one-upmanship one step further with the launch of a range of adorable ankle bracelets already adorning the limbs of the mini A-list. The Saturdays' Una Healy was one of the first to put a set of Saffron Bells on daughter Aoife Belle, with Michelle Heaton's baby Faith and Amanda Holden's baby Hollie, both joining in with the trend too. Stylish tot: Una Healy's daughter Aoife Belle dons the stylish Saffron Bells, which are silver anklets with tiny bells on . The idea behind Saffron Bells came when magazine journalist Charlotte Fall had a pair of anklets handmade for her baby girl Saffron. She was stunned by the number of people who would stop her in the street to find out where the baby bells were from. Not only was she impressed by the stir they caused, but she says she also loved knowing where her baby daughter was at all times, thanks to the light tinkling sound the bells made as Saffron crawled about. Not long afterwards, the idea for Saffron Bells was born. Fast forward to today and Saffron Bells has expanded from a twinkle in Charlotte's eye to the UK’s first baby anklet jewellery label. Celebrity fans are coming in . thick and fast with Amanda Holden describing them as 'very sweet' and . Michelle Heaton dubbing them 'so cute'. Handmade with solid silver, Saffron Bells expandable anklet pairs are suitable from birth and are designed to grow with the child. They cost £85 for a single and £140 for a pair. Each bangle has two bells, with the pair having four - representing love, health, success and gratitude - that jingle with every move. They can be worn into toddlerhood, after which they convert into wrist bracelets and can be worn for many more years. Although the company only launched at . the end of last year, they have already landed a coveted award after being . handed gold in the Mumpreneur UK Website Awards 2013. First of their kind: The bells were the brainchild of Charlotte Fall and are priced at £85 each . Famous young fans: Hollie Holden and Faith Heaton also have a pair of the Saffron Bells and both celebrity mothers Amanda and Michelle have spoken out about how much they love the designs . They are suitable from 0–2 years old, after which they convert to wrist bracelets . Although Saffron Bells are a new concept for the UK, they are inspired by the traditions of Thailand – where anklets with bells are given to babies (both male and female) to ward off bad spirits . Weighing 23g (traditional baby bangles weigh only 4g) 925 sterling silver Saffron Bells are substantial, they are 100% safe and they expand as your child grows.

The first arrests using new hate crime measures have been made after a 16-year-old boy was punched in the face. The teenager, described as an ‘emo’, was attacked days after a policy protecting sub-cultures came into effect. The boy was allegedly punched in an unprovoked attack at 6.30pm in Ashton, Greater Manchester, as he walked with a younger friend. The new policies at Greater Manchester Police were sparked by the murder of Sophie Lancaster, 20, who was attacked in a park with her boyfriend who took exception to her appearance . ‘Emo’, or emotional, is a rock music genre. Fans typically wear black, skinny jeans and hoodies. Police have arrested a 44-year-old man and a 14-year-old boy. The victim’s friend, 14, who was also . attacked, said: ‘If they are going to classify crimes like this as hate . crimes, that’s good because it could make the punishment more severe.’ The case is the first since Greater . Manchester Police adopted procedures which mean offences against goths, . emos, punks and other sub-culture groups will be recorded as hate . crimes. They will be added to offences aimed . at people due to their race, disability, sexual orientation or because . they are transgender. The campaign for the law was led by . Sylvia Lancaster, whose daughter Sophie, 20, was killed in 2007 because . of her ‘goth’ outfit. Last week she said: ‘Hopefully other forces will . follow GMP’s lead.’ The man and boy, of Manchester, were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning actual bodily harm and bailed until May 7. Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan . said the attack was the first recorded sub-culture hate crime. He said: . ‘It is unfortunate this incident happened but the fact we were able to . identify this as a hate crime is very positive.’ The two people held after the attack . on the 16-year-old were arrested on suspicion of assault occasioning . actual bodily harm after the attack in the Tameside area on Monday. The pair have been released on police bail until May 7. Assistant Chief Constable Garry .

Assistant Chief Constable Garry Shewan said the use of the new measures was 'positive' 'It is unfortunate that this incident . happened but the fact we were able to identify this as a hate crime is . very positive. Just last Thursday we announced that we will now record . alternative sub-culture as a hate motivation. 'We hope this encourages victims to continue to come forward so we can take positive action against offenders.' Sylvia Lancaster set up the Sophie Lancaster Foundation which campaigns against intolerance and prejudice. Sophie and her boyfriend, Robert Maltby, 21, were beaten without provocation as they walked through a park in Bacup, Lancashire, in 2007. Mr Maltby was beaten unconscious and as Sophie cradled his head in her lap, she was set upon by two of them. Sophie, who was due to start an English degree at university a month later, suffered horrendous injuries. She survived for 13 days in intensive care before the decision was made to switch off her life support machine. Ryan Herbert, 16, admitted murder and was sentenced to a minimum of 16 years.

Her local Rhyl and District League, in North Wales, says girls can play in all league competitions until the age of 15. 12-year-old Victoria Coulton was ordered off the pitch after kick off because she was too old to play alongside boys . But the Welsh FA says girls can no longer play in mixed teams beyond 12. Victoria started the match, but it was halted shortly after kick-off, and she had to be substituted. Prestatyn High School pupil Victoria lined up to take part in a Rhyl and District cup semi final with Trefnant on March 30 - but before the game kicked off, the opposing manager flagged up whether or not she should be playing. Despite the Trefnant coach's concern, Victoria's dad Nigel said the referee allowed her to play. ‘Five minutes into the game the female Trefnant coach asked the ref to stop the game and had a mobile in her hand with a member of the Rhyl and District League on the other end,’ added Mr Coulton.

Her parents Nigel and Lindsay Coulton say they were shocked at the move. Mr Coulton, said: ‘If you are eligible to start a season then you should be able to finish it. ‘At the start of the season Victoria was give permission by her club and the league to play this season. ‘On March 26, Victoria turned 12 but the Rhyl and District rules state that anyone under 12, before August 31 is eligible to compete in the under-12s for that season.’ Mr Coulton said he and his wife are both devastated for Victoria, who wants to continue playing in a mixed team because there is more competition.

A young boy bled to death in hospital over a weekend due to a severe lack of communication between doctors, a coroner has ruled. Two-year-old Tharun Umashankar died from bleeding of the stomach lining which was probably caused by his intolerance to milk. He was rushed into Sheffield Children's Hospital and despite suffering a previous large internal bleed, was not earmarked for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the next day. Independent expert Dr David Crabbe, a paediatric surgeon, said the procedure would have found the bleeding and Tharun could have had an operation that day to remove part of his stomach - a procedure which would have saved him. Tragic: Two-year-old Tharun Umashankar bled to death in hospital due to a lack of communication between doctors, a coroner has ruled . He told the Sheffield inquest: 'What was a complete failure was the lack of collaboration between surgeons and gastroenterologists. Closer teamwork would have resulted in a different outcome.' Tharun's distraught mother Sentamil, 38, broke down and sobbed as she told the hearing: 'I believed they would cure him and make him well.' Recording a narrative verdict, Sheffield Cornoner Chris Dories said: 'On the basis of expert opinion, there was a a failure to plan and/or a failure to communicate about a child who was known to be at serious risk. 'While it remains unclear whether requested communication to the gastroenterologist at the first sign of deterioration would have saved Tharun's life, it is very clear that it may have done so. 'However, endoscopy and surgery on the previous day would likely have saved Tharun's life, but such was a matter of judgment rather than specific failure.' Tharun had endured three endoscopies at the hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain, but was thought well enough to be discharged on Friday, July 9, 2010. Delay: Tharun was rushed into Sheffield Children's Hospital and, despite suffering a previous large internal bleed, was not earmarked for an endoscopy to look at his digestive system until the next day . Consultant paediatric . gastroenterologist Dr David Campbell, who was in overall charge of . Tharun although off-duty that weekend, said he left instructions to be . called if the boy had a serious bleed again. Mrs . Umashankar, who also has two daughters aged seven months and seven, . left with her son but during the night he vomited blood again. 'He cried . and I felt he was in pain,' she said. 'His body was cool and . exhausted.' Tharun was rushed by ambulance to Barnsley District Hospital and several hours later was transferred to the Children's Hospital unit on the afternoon of Saturday, July 10. The mother said after doctors checked her son she noticed his nappy was 'full of blood' which she was worried about and claimed the wet bed covers had to be changed at least five times by nurses. 'A nurse told me it was a good sign as the blood was coming through his faeces and not the mouth,' she said. Mrs Umashankar was then told by staff that Dr Campbell would perform another endoscopy on Tharun at 8am on the Sunday morning. An independent expert said an endoscopy would have found the bleeding and Tharun could have had an operation that day to remove part of his stomach, saving his life . But in the middle of the night she . noticed his stomach was distended and 'swollen like a bubble'. A doctor . thought it might simply be a build-up of gas, but at 4am Tharun vomited . blood again. By 6.30am . 'all the doctors were in panic and confused'. She said that when Dr . Campbell arrived she was pleased, as 'I believed he was going to save my . so'. But despite a blood transfusion, Tharun failed to respond and he died at 9am on the Sunday. Paediatric registrar Dr Tafadzwa Makaya, whose job was to stabilise the boy, told the Sheffield inquest she had not been informed of any 'red button plan' to alert Dr Campbell and a surgical team if there was a further bleed. When she first saw Tharun he was sat up in bed watching CBeebies on a monitor with his mother and appeared stable. She was only called by a nurse at 4.30am when he vomited blood again. She instructed he be given more fluid as he had low blood pressure and a raised pulse, called for closer monitoring and ordered some units of blood which should have been ready. Dr Makaya said she alerted both the surgical and medical registrars to the situation and was told Dr Campbell would be coming in as planned to carry out an endoscopy at 8am. Tharun had already had three endoscopies at Sheffield Children's Hospital in the previous fortnight after vomiting blood and suffering stomach pain . When coroner Chris Dorries pointed out that Dr Campbell had asked to be made aware if there was any further bleeding she replied: 'There was no red button plan delivered to me.' Dr Michael Powers QC, for the family, put it to Dr Makaya: 'Knowing that this is a significant bleed, you didn't make any contact with anyone anywhere until 6.15am.' She replied: 'I assessed and I managed and then I contacted my superiors.' Tharun's family are now taking civil action for damages against the hospital . Specialist paediatric registrar Dr James Pauling said he arranged for Dr Campbell to do the endoscopy on Sunday morning and there was no contingency plan in place. He said: 'I don't recall him saying he had to be called back in the event of further bleeding.' He himself was not told of any further fresh bleeding which could have been a 'serious finding'. Mrs Umashankar and her petrol station cashier husband Sivananthan, 42, ran a grocery store in Barnsley at the time but after the tragedy moved to live with relatives in Tooting, London. They came to the UK 12 years ago and are British nationals. Dr Crabbe, who reviewed the case, said Tharun had a 'mighty strange illness' for a child and he had not come across such a case of catastrophic upper gastrointestinal bleeding in a child before. He said the Children's Hospital was unique in that Tharun was admitted to the care of paediatricians rather than surgeons. The boy should have had an endoscopy on the Saturday afternoon which was an 'error of judgment' by the doctors caring for him. After the hearing, Tharun's uncle Murali Gunarajah, speaking for the family said: 'They are very, very sad that this has happened to their baby. 'They are also upset that the hospital has not apologised or said sorry so far. They think no mother should have to go through what she has again.' The family are taking civil action for damages against the hospital.","Two-year-old Tharun Umashankar died from bleeding of the stomach lining .

Metropolitan Police PCSO Billy Wheatley was jailed after admitted 18 sex crimes on children as young as six . A former Metropolitan Police PCSO with a 13 year history of child sex abuse that began when he was just 12 years old has been jailed. Billy Wheatley, 25, videoed himself on a mobile phone abusing a girl aged just five or six and recorded sexual assaults while wearing a hidden camera. He was working for the force in Bromley when he committed some of the series of offences that spanned 13 years. He admitted 18 sex crimes dating back to 2000, including two counts of assaulting a girl under 13 by penetration. Even after his arrest, Wheatley, from Sidcup, Kent, continued to make indecent images of children. He was jailed for five-and-a-half years at Woolwich Crown Court yesterday. Scotland Yard detectives said it is 'highly likely' Wheatley abused other children and urged  victims to come forward. Wheatley, who worked as PCSO in Bromley, filmed himself sexually assaulting a young girl, took indecent photos of children and kept thousands of indecent images and videos of youngsters on his computer. Officer's from the Met's paedophile unit raided his home and arrested him for possession of indecent photographs of children on September 13, last year. Police found almost 69,000 indecent photos and films of children, and mobile phone footage of him sexually assaulting a girl aged five or six. Nine more movies of young children were found that appeared to be taken by him wearing a secret camera. He was arrested again on November 23 for sexual assault by penetration and causing a child to engage in sexual activity and voyeurism. In interview he told police who the young girl in the film was and admitted assaulting her on two previous occasions. He also admitted assaulting the girl's older brother when he was 13 or 14. He pleaded guilty to 18 charges in . February, including indecent assault on a boy under 14 between 2000 and . 2002, two counts of assault of a female child under 13 by penetration . between December 31 2009 and September 12 2012, sexual assault of a girl . under 13, voyeurism and taking indecent photographs of girls and . children, all between 2009 and 2012.

The court heard police found 69,000 indecent images and videos of children, including mobile phone footage of him abusing a girl . Speaking after the sentencing, investigating officer Detective Sergeant Andrew Gattase said: 'As a PCSO, Wheatley was in a position of trust and had a responsibility to his local community. 'Instead he abused that position to take part in despicable crimes, an urge he couldn't control even after he had been arrested and bailed. 'It is highly likely there are further victims of Wheatley who we don't know about and I would urge them to come forward and contact us. 'I am pleased the dedicated and tireless work of the Met's paedophile unit has put an end to the activities of Wheatley. 'This case also shows the Met's commitment to ensuring those who commit crime are dealt with thoroughly and rooted out from the organisation.'","Billy Wheatley, 25, admitted 18 sex crimes on children dating back to 2000 .

Matthew Hoare, 21, died when repairing a puncture on a 5ft tyre of a loader vehicle for Watling Tyres . A novice fitter died when a tyre exploded in his face just weeks after he complained about faulty equipment and a lack of training, an inquest heard. Matthew Hoare, 21, had only been in his job for six months when he lost his life. He was repairing a puncture on a 5ft tyre of a loader vehicle by inflating it directly from a compressor instead of using a safer inflating line. The compressor made the tyre rupture and Matthew was killed instantly as he was blown 15ft across the workshop at Watling Tyres in Canterbury, Kent. His grieving mother Carolyn Hoare told a coroner how her son had complained to her about the safety procedures at his work. And she said that when he asked for further training his manager told him there was none. Mrs Hoare, 53, said: ‘Matthew often told me about the state of his equipment and, in particular, a faulty pressure gauge which he reported to his manager. ‘One morning while getting ready for work, he said he had asked his manager for training but was told there wasn't any for commercial tyres, even though he was out and about in a van doing it. ‘He was told if he didn't want the job, there were other people who did. But he enjoyed it. Matthew was a very hard-working and loyal person.’ The inquest also heard the van of equipment Matthew was working from was a ‘mess’ and there was no gauge to tell the tyre-fitter how much pressure he was applying. The tyre-fitting equipment was taken for examination by health and safety inspectors immediately after the death on January 27, 2006. The inquest has been delayed for seven years to allow police investigations to be concluded. Matthew Hoare, 21 (pictured centre with sister Jenna, then 19, and brother Daniel, then 23), had complained about faulty equipment and his lack of training just weeks before he died . Carolyn Hoare, Matthew's mother (pictured centre with his brother Daniel, left, and her partner Graham, right) said Matthew was loyal and hard-working . The CPS, Kent police and a judicial review concluded there was no criminal case for Watling Tyres to answer. The inquest was further delayed by an ongoing investigation by the Health and Safety Executive. Health and Safety Executive Inspector Mike Walters said of the van carrying the equipment: ‘It was mess inside - not very well-organised. ‘There were booklets with tyre pressure charts for vehicles but nothing relating to a digger-type vehicle. ‘The compressor had only half a gauge - the glass was broken and the needle missing. ‘There was no other gauge outside the vehicle meaning Matthew would have had no way of knowing what air pressure was going into the tyre. The Watling Tyres' director and the company's regional branch manager refused to answer questions at the inquest on the advice of their barrister . ‘There were health and safety regulations on display, booklets about health and safety and blank personal training record forms, but I could find nothing to indicate Matthew had received any training. Matthew Hoare, 21, pictured with his mother Carolyn (right), died in 2006 while working for Watling Tyres . ‘It's fair to say I was not happy with the training regime within the company and issued an improvement notice to ensure all current staff and new people were competent to do what was asked of them. ‘In general terms, they needed to sort out the shortcomings in their training system.’ The Watling Tyres' director and the company's regional branch manager refused to answer crucial questions at the inquest on the advice of their barrister. The inquest jury did hear a statement made by director Andrew Wright to police and health and safety officers soon after Matthew's death. In it he said that training for new recruits was the responsibility of depot branch managers. Mr Wright said: ‘I ensured all branch managers were familiar with our Health and Safety requirements and they had been reminded to complete training records. ‘I understand a training record was not completed by the branch manager Des Smith. ‘Matthew was a quick learner and after three months had experience in car, commercial and agricultural work and it was decided he could go solo. ‘For some reason, he decided to inflate the tyre directly from the compressor when he should have attached it to a hand held line. ‘If he didn't have the correct size adaptor, he should have returned to pick one up or called for assistance.’ ‘I could not have taken any further steps to prevent the incident.’ The inquest continues.","Matthew Hoare, 21, was blown 15ft across the workshop when tyre exploded .

"By . Anna Hodgekiss . PUBLISHED: . 04:47 EST, 8 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 05:40 EST, 8 April 2013 . Dr Michael Dixon said that hospitals would be forced to slim down considerably . Hospitals will have to shrink or close altogether in the wake of new reforms that have given GPs control of more than two-thirds of the health service’s annual budget. Dr Michael Dixon, who represents many of the clinical commissioning groups (CCGs) that last week took control of £65bn of health spending, said that hospitals would be forced to slim down considerably as more services are moved out to the community. Under the new reforms, every GP’s practice in England is affiliated to one of 211 commissioning groups, whose boards of GPs, nurses, hospital doctors and lay members will decide how to spend the local health budget. The reforms -- which replace the old local Primary Care Trusts – are intended to cut bureaucracy, reduce costs and foster competition, encouraging private firms and charities to take on health service contracts. Dr Dixon told The Guardian that diagnostic tests, outpatient appointments and much of care for the elderly should be moved to local clinics to improve services to patients and save money. His vision is that rather than being one of first port of calls for medical treatment, hospitals would need to downsize and become centres of excellence for specialist, and/or intensive care. Patients needing more general care could be looked after in the community. Care of elderly patients, in particular, could radically change under the reforms. Older people account for around 70 per cent of hospital bed occupancy, but could in the future be cared for at home by teams of community-based health professionals, Dr Dixon said. Dr Dixon, interim president of NHS Clinical Commissioners, said believes that at least believes that half of hospitals’ current workloads ‘could or should be done elsewhere’. He added that there was an ‘an awful lot of fat’ in the NHS budget and the health service needed to become more patient-friendly. When asked by the newspaper whether . the reforms would mean hospitals had to slim down, close or both, Dr . Dixon said both would be options. The issue of GPs holding the purse . strings could also damage relationships with patients, he conceded, . given how vehemently opposed local hospital closures are opposed by . residents. New reforms introduced last week mean that GPs have responsibility for more than two-thirds of the health service's annual budget . He said that CCGs were ‘up’ for pushing through the reforms needed – while managing the demands of the elderly population on the NHS – would need ‘considerable protection and support’ to implement necessary changes. The BMA has said that changes to the services offered by hospitals should be a gradual process and based on clinical evidence rather than cost-cutting. Mike Farrar, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, which represents hospitals, said the ageing population meant hospitals had to change how they operated, the aim being to keep people living independently out of hospitals for longer. He said: ‘This is a difficult journey but it's one the NHS has to make. A good analogy is that until the 1980s people with mental illness and learning disabilities were looked after in hospitals and then there was a big shift of care into the community. That was controversial at the time but is now, years later, recognised as having been the right thing.’; . He added that a large proportion of hospital staff would have to start working in non-hospital settings to make the new forms of care work for . A report last year for the Royal College Of Physicians found that many hospital buildings, services and staff are not equipped to deal with the increasing number of older people being admitted to hospital with multiple, complex needs, including dementia.","New reforms mean GPs will look after two-thirds of the annual NHS budget .

A two-year-old boy who longed to be alive for the birth of his sister has lost his battle to a rare genetic disorder just four days before her arrival. Archie Watson died last Monday after suffering from Tay-Sachs, which causes deterioration of nerve cells, mental and physical abilities and a maximum life expectancy of four years. Now his parents, Bradley, 34 and Lauren, 27, believe he is watching over their newborn, Matilda Rose, as her guardian angel. A life cut short: Two-year-old Archie Watson suffered from a rare genetic disorder and died four days before his longed-for baby sister was born . Archie was suffering from Tay-Sachs, a rare but fatal genetic condition that causes derioration of nerve cells and a maximum life expectancy of four years . Mr Watson, from South Wales, said: 'Matilda has a guardian angel now in Archie, who will be there for her. I know it sounds strange, but we honestly believe it - that she will carry on where he left off. 'We wanted him to be here when she was born, but he was poorly and hung on for as long as possible. He is not suffering any more.' Archie, who was diagnosed in December 2011, died at Ty Hafan Children's Hospice, after singing his favourite Sesame Street songs and watching a starlight projector. His death resulted in Lauren, who was due to give birth on April 7, deciding to be induced. Four days after Archie died, his sister Matilda Rose was born (pictured with parents Lauren and Bradley and bother Jack). Mr and Mrs Watson believe Archie is watching over his sister as her guardian angel . She didn't want to miss the celebration of his life, which they are having instead of a funeral. Matilda Rose arrived on Friday afternoon, weighing 7lbs 8oz. At nine months, Archie stopped developing properly, had trouble walking and began having seizures. He was then diagnosed with Tay-Sachs. Mr Watson said: 'We could have wallowed in despair, closed the curtains and counted down the days. But, we threw the curtains open and got much good out of something so bad. 'After he was diagnosed, we had a ""no tears at Christmas"" policy. We didn't want regrets and to look back having wasted two years we had with Archie.' The little boy's life was crammed with as much fun as possible from trips to Euro Disney and Wembley, as well as being a mascot for the Cardiff Blues rugby team. Archie, who was diagnosed in December 2011, died at Ty Hafan Children's Hospice, after singing his favourite Sesame Street songs . Mr Watson, who works for an insurance broker in Cardiff, told his local paper that the couple had first realised there was something wrong with Archie when he started having fits at the age of nine months. He told the said: 'Archie suddenly started having a lot of seizures. Then, just before Christmas, he had some blood tests and brain scans and it was found that he had a deficiency of a protein which helps the nervous system. 'Unfortunately both my wife and I are carriers of the gene, so Archie inherited that gene. 'We knew something was wrong as his development was changing and he was having the seizures. Archie's death resulted in Mrs Watson, was due to give birth on April 7, deciding to be induced, so as not to miss the celebration of Archie's life being held instead of a funeral . 'We thought is might be cerebral palsy or something similar, but we did not realise it would be terminal.' Then, after Archie developed pneumonia, the family feared he wouldn't make it to Christmas. His parents and brother Jack, 10, said goodbye every day of the final four weeks they spent at Ty Hafan and had a birthday for each of the 30 months Archie lived. Mr Watson said: 'He fought until there was nothing left in him. He was hoping to meet his sister, but it wasn't meant to be. His legacy will live on and he will keep inspiring people.' His story has touched the hearts of thousands of people through postings on social networking sites as he bravely fought the terminal illness. Through sky dives, marathons and other fundraisers, family and friends have already raised £23,000 for Caerphilly Children's Centre, Ty Hafan and Cure and Action for Tay-Sachs. For more information: www.amazingarchie.com/index.html . Tay-Sachs disease is a rare and usually fatal genetic disorder that causes progressive damage to the nervous system. In . the most common form of the condition, symptoms usually begin at around . five months of age, when a previously normal child’s development begins . to slow and they gradually lose their ability to move. Other symptoms . can include muscle stiffness and fits. The first noticeable symptom is . usually that a baby is excessively surprised and startled by noises, . such as people clapping their hands or a telephone ringing. A red spot . may also appear near the centre of each of their eyes. Babies with the condition will also be much slower in reaching developmental milestones, such as gripping . objects and learning to crawl. Tay-Sachs . disease is caused by a genetic mutation. This happens when the . instructions that are found in all living cells become 'scrambled' in . some way, causing one or more processes of the body not to work . properly. In Tay-Sachs disease, a genetic mutation known as the . HEXA mutation results in the body not producing an enzyme called . Hexosaminidase-A (Hex-A).

A furious husband has told how he only discovered his wife had been put on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway when he overheard staff talking about her. Josephine Dunn, 73, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham on March 30 with a urinary tract infection. Her husband Stuart, 68, rushed to the hospital to be with his wife but claims he was told by doctors that she had 'no chance' of surviving. Angry: Stuart Dunn is furious after doctors put his wife Josephine on the controversial Liverpool Care Pathway without his knowledge . Mrs Dunn, here on her wedding day in 1972, suffers from Alzheimer's disease. She was taken to the Queen's Medical Centre in Nottingham with a urinary tract infection but went downhill fast . Mrs Dunn came around later that day - but her husband only became aware she had been put on the end-of-life plan when he overheard a doctor talking to a nurse. Despite doctors ruling she qualified for the Liverpool Care Pathway, Mrs Dunn, a retired cleaner, was discharged from hospital on April 2. She was taken back to Peacemills Care Home in Nottingham and where she is recovering. The NHS Trust responsible for the hospital has apologised for a 'breakdown in communication' with Mr Dunn. But today the retired WHSmith worker slammed the hospital for leaving his wife-of-40 years 'to die'. Mr Dunn, from Nottingham, fumed: 'I got a call saying you had better get to the hospital. She was in a holding bay off A&E and then she was put in a side ward. 'The doctor came to me and said no chance at all that she is going to pull through. 'She came around Saturday lunchtime and I gave her some water and some yoghurt. I never saw another doctor until the Sunday. 'On Sunday I just happened to hear a doctor saying to a nurse ""I'll have to take her off the Pathway"". When he asked a nurse to clarify the situation, she said: 'Yes, I thought you knew.' Mr Dunn (right) said he only became aware his wife had been put on the end-of-life plan when he overheard a doctor talking to a nurse about it . Mr Dunn said: 'An apology isn't good enough. I first overheard Josephine was on the pathway from hearing doctors and nurses talking. 'I wouldn't have known had I not heard them gossiping. No one told me directly. I was angry because I know what the Liverpool Care Pathway is.' The pathway gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or . medication are helpful, to consider how to keep the patient as . comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should . still be given. It was initially developed for the care of dying cancer patients. But last year the NHS was accused of using it as a way of prematurely ending elderly people's lives. Recovering: Seven days since she left hospital, Mrs Dunn is 'happy' and back at her care home . Mr Dunn said: 'As soon as I realised what was going on, I asked for her to be taken off it and the mood immediately changed. 'If she had died Saturday morning, I wouldn't have known she was on Pathway. I had to tell my daughter and she had to bring the grandkids up to say goodbye to her. 'In my mind, once you reach that certain age, they don't seem to care, you're just a number. To me, it's wrong, they just decided that's it, she has no chance.' Mrs Dunn started developing dementia ten years ago and five years ago moved to a care home when her round-the-clock care needs became too much for her husband to cope with on his own. Mrs Dunn, who has one daughter Cara, 33, and two grandchildren, is recovering at the care home. Mr Dunn said: 'I don't want people to go through what I had to, they should at least be informed. 'I suppose it's a good thing if you're terminally ill but not when they give someone no chance to recover when they can. 'Seven days since she left hospital, she is sat in the care home and is happy. 'An apology doesn't make things right - they left her to die.' Dr Stephen Fowlie, Medical Director at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust, said: 'We have apologised to Mr Dunn for the breakdown in communication in his wife's care. 'The Liverpool Care Pathway is used at NUH as established best practice for guiding the treatment of patients at the end of their life. 'However this decision should not have been enacted without discussion with Mr Dunn, who arrived at the hospital a short time after his wife.' The idea behind the Liverpool Care Pathway is to allow people with a terminal illness to die with dignity regardless of whether they are at home, in hospital or in a hospice. It was developed during the late 1990s at the Royal Liverpool University Hospital in conjunction with the Marie Curie Palliative Care Institute. It gives doctors the opportunity to review whether further tests or medication are helpful, to consider how to keep the patient as comfortable as possible and to decide whether fluids and food should still be given. It is now recommended by the Department of Health as a model of best practice and has been adopted by most hospitals. It was introduced because during the 1990s there was increasing consensus that standards of end-of-life care were patchy and that some hospices were providing excellent care while others were not. Particular concern was expressed about patients being subjected to invasive treatment that offered no chance of preventing death and of people being put through unnecessary suffering by needlessly prolonging life. It has been controversial as some families have claimed that their loved ones have been put on the pathway without their consent and that it has resulted in them dying earlier than they would otherwise have done.","Josephine Dunn, 73, was admitted to hospital with a urinary tract infection .

A seriously ill patient was treated in an NHS store room surrounded by cardboard boxes because the overstretched hospital was ‘too full’ to give her a bed. Bernadette Horton, 46, was taken to the tiny room with no central heating and put on a makeshift camp bed after being admitted to the A&E department at Glan Clwyd Hospital in north Wales struggling for breath and hallucinating. Despite being barely conscious as a result of serious pneumonia, doctors allegedly said the mother-of-four would be better off at home as there was no room for her. She was also told she would be unable to have the X-ray she needed because the equipment was faulty. She claims there were four doctors in the department, two nurses and one healthcare assistant working during the chaotic shift at Glan Clwyd hospital A&E unit in north Wales. Mrs Horton, from Prestatyn, who is now recovering at home, said: ‘Staff in hospitals do care about their patients but there are not enough of them to cope. ‘Wards have been shut and there are not enough beds for patients. ‘Staff are doing their best in impossible circumstances with poor resources, yet they are demoralised on a daily basis.’ Last year Department of Health figures revealed that nearly 67,000 patients waited up to 12 hours on a trolley or parked in side rooms over a six-month period. This may simply be the tip of the iceberg, as NHS analysts say clever number-crunching by hospitals may be hiding the true extent of the problem. Mrs Horton added: ‘My husband found out that there were four doctors in the department, two nurses and one healthcare assistant. And this was a mid-week Wednesday, not a weekend. ‘Staff were overrun with sheer numbers of people to treat, and there were simply not enough of them to cope. The doctor apologised for the room they had to use temporarily. ‘It was a store room with boxes in, with a makeshift treatment bed installed and no heating. It felt very cold but as my temperature was high, I did not care. ‘The doctor made routine investigations and said I needed an X-ray, as this would show up pneumonia for definite. 'But he explained the X-ray department was “down” currently. Mrs Horton, who is pictured with husband Barrie, was deemed to be too ill to wait in the waiting room so was told to sit in a staff meeting room while she awaited treatment . ‘He told me: “The hospital is full. There are no beds currently. It's midnight and I fear that if you were . to wait for a bed, you would be here all night in a chair until the day . staff come on shift. I can give you the antibiotics needed, but to be . frank, you will be better off in your own bed at home than waiting . here”.’ The . incident occurred after Mrs Horton suffered two weeks of cold and flu . symptoms and was taken to the hospital by her husband, Barrie. Nurses initially deemed her too ill to sit in the waiting room and instead sent her to wait in a nearby staff meeting room. But Mrs Horton was then taken to the cold storeroom as staff needed the meeting room. Mrs Horton, who has now started a blog called 'Mum vs Austerity' to campaign against NHS cuts, said: ‘I was gasping for breath, had a hacking repeated cough, a high temperature and the straw that broke the camel's back - hallucinations. At hospital I could not hold my head up and lolled to one side in the chair. ‘The triage nurse assessed me and queried pneumonia. I was then told I would have to wait for the doctor, but the waiting room was not ideal for me so I was put in a nurses meeting room. Mrs Horton, who is pictured with sons Luca and Joseph, was then moved to be treated in a store room on a camp bed because the staff room was needed and there were no spare beds . ‘I was wheeled past a corridor full . of sick people on trolleys, past the packed waiting room and the . cubicles, which were all full, and into the nurses meeting room. ‘A healthcare assistant brought me some water and then scurried away. My husband asked a passing nurse whether there was anywhere I could lie down as I was in danger of falling out if the wheelchair as I could not hold my head up and was lolling to one side. ‘She said everywhere was full, but she would see how long I had to wait to see the doctor as she could see I was very ill. My husband then asked for a pillow to support me, but was told there were none available and was offered a rolled up blanket.’ Mr Horton was then called away to pick up one of the couple’s children - forcing him to leave Mrs Horton at the hospital. She said: ‘The nurse said it may take ""some time"" to be seen then asked me if I could wait in the foyer as they needed the room. ‘I replied I could not get up and walk as I was very weak. She said she did not have the time to wheel me into the foyer, so I would have to walk as best I could. Mrs Horton needed an X-ray to confirm that she had pneumonia but was told that this was not possible as the equipment was faulty . ‘I only remember blurred visions of people passing by. I managed to get there and waited for my husband to return. A couple of teenagers asked me if I was alright as I was slumped in the chair. ‘My husband returned and he later said he was so shocked and angry that I was dumped in a chair by the front door, that words failed him. ‘When I returned home I saw a practice GP and my husband related the hospital experience and the GP agreed it was totally unacceptable. He said he had heard of patients being sent to another hospital some 50 miles away.’ Glan Clwyd Hospital came under fire in December last year in a damning report by the Health Inspectorate of Wales which said the best efforts of ‘committed’ A&E staff at the Bodelwyddan hospital were being undermined by ‘inadequate premises, poor communication and a lack of clinical leadership’. Meanwhile a  report released in February found that urgent changes were needed in NHS staffing after more than half of dignity spot-checks in Wales’ hospitals raised concerns about patient safety. Opposition parties, patient safety groups and leading medical organisations have all said that low staffing levels on hospital wards, particularly at night, is putting patients at risk. A spokesman for the Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board said: ‘We are very sorry that Mrs Horton feels let down by the care provided to her. This is not the type of care we want to provide for our patients at all. ‘During the last few weeks we have faced significant pressures, along with the rest of Wales, due to a rise in the number of seriously ill patients being admitted to hospital. Mrs Horton is now writing a blog called Mum vs Austerity to campaign against NHS cuts . ‘Our doctors and nurses are working . extremely hard to cope with increased pressure on beds as patients need . to stay longer in hospital to recover than normal.’ The . news of Mrs Horton’s experience at Glan Clwyd Hospital comes just two . months after it was revealed that a father died of meningitis after . doctors at the hospital dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints. Marciano Nolan, 46, contracted a rare form of the disease but medics dismissed his symptoms as swollen joints and later said it was simply a virus 'doing the rounds'. His condition rapidly deteriorated and he died four days after he first felt ill. The same hospital also came under scrutiny in 2011 after it was revealed that a surgeon needlessly amputated a woman’s leg. Amit Sinha, an orthopaedic consultant at the hospital carried out an above knee amputation on Michelle Richards' right leg in 2006 after diagnosing osteomyeltitis, a serious and potentially life-threatening bone infection. Mrs Richards, from Towyn, Conwy, already had a below-the-knee amputation on the same leg in 1995, partially as a result of her spina bifida. But, after the operation, subsequent tests - carried out at the insistence of the mother-of-three - found no evidence of the disease and Mrs Richards was told: 'Sorry there's been a mistake.'","Bernadette Horton was taken to Glan Clwyd Hospital struggling to breathe .

A London hospital is offering HIV screening to everyone who has a blood test in an attempt to diagnose the 25 per cent of people unaware they have the virus. Throughout April, The Royal London Hospital, in Whitechapel, is offering everyone having a blood test taken in A&E routine HIV screening. The scheme has been deemed necessary in an attempt to 'diagnose the undiagnosed' because these people cause an estimated 75 per cent of new cases. Usually a patient or doctor must specifically request an HIV test if it is deemed necessary. ‘HIV can be symptomless for a long time,’ said Dr Chloe Orkin, the Barts Health HIV Consultant behind the routine testing plan. ‘That means it's very easy for people not to be diagnosed until it's too late for today's life-saving treatments to have their best effect. 'People are still dying of HIV in the UK - but only because they test too late.’ The pilot comes after research found people who were diagnosed late accounted for nearly a third of all AIDS deaths last year. Straight men are the least likely to be tested, said Dr Ann Sullivan, from the Sexual Health Centre at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital. Dr Sullivan, consultant physician in HIV at the hospital and an honorary lecturer at Imperial College, said: 'Those who don't know they are infected are responsible for between 50 and 75 per cent of new infections. That is a hugely disproportional number of people passing on HIV. 'It is not likely cancer, where people who have it are seen as blameless. There is still a lot of stigma particularly among heterosexual men, and women. 'This group do not think they are at risk, so are more likely to present later, but if you have sex without protection you should have a test. The scheme has been deemed necessary as 25 per cent of HIV positive people in the UK are unaware that they are infected . 'We need another big campaign because . there is a lack of knowledge. People remember those scary ads from the . 80s with the tombstone. That was right for the time, but things have . moved on. AIDS is not a death sentence, or indeed is it anything to be . ashamed of. 'With new treatments and . technologies, there is only around a five or ten year difference in life . expectancy. People with HIV go to work, they have children, they lead . very normal lives.' Despite this, other recent research found that between 1990 and 2010, cases of HIV infection rose by 76 . per cent due to fewer people using condoms. Experts . believe that the fall in condom use has been causes by the development . of antiretroviral drugs which have reduced the levels of fear associated . with the disease. Dr Steve Taylor, HIV Specialist at Birmingham Heartlands . Hospital and Medical Director of Saving Lives, an HIV awareness . charity, said: ‘One of the things our campaigns help . do is correct some commonly-held out-dated myths that perpetuate this . stigma which make the lives of people living with HIV very difficult. ‘Getting tested, looking after your sexual health, education and prevention are what it’s all about. ‘If . people have taken risks and by that I simply mean having unprotected . sex, then there is every reason to get tested - it could save your . life.’ The screening programme is being part-organised by HIV awareness charity Saving Lives, which is running a campaign called the Saving Lives Avengers. The initiative aims to use well-known sports personalities to educate people about the importance of HIV testing. The campaign, which is being . organised by Barts Health NHS Trust and HIV charity Saving Lives, is . being piloted in Whitechapel because the area is thought to have an HIV . population five times the size of the national average – in Whitechapel . six in every 1,000 people are believed to be HIV positive.","The Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel is offering HIV screening to all patients having blood tests .

But in fact the damage to this German birch has been caused by beavers. The large, flat-tailed, semi-aquatic rodents are more usually associated with North America after the European variety was practically hunted to extinction. Timber! A birch gnawed by beavers stands near Lengenwang, in Bavaria, southern Germany. The animals, once hunted to near extinction in Europe, have been reintroduced to the area . In Germany since 1979, however, there has been a programme to reintroduce the animals - resulting in the horrendous damage to this birch in Bavaria's Legenwang municipality. The animals like to snack on the bark of trees - particularly birch - resulting in this 'ringing' effect as they chew all the way around the trunk as high as they can reach. But although these pictures might suggest otherwise, beavers are in fact good for woodland habitats, even trees. Often regarded as nature's engineers, Beavers are known for building dams on rivers and streams, and building their homes - known as 'lodges' - in the resulting pond. Tough love: Although these pictures might suggest otherwise, beavers are in fact good for woodland habitats, even trees . Remarkably, the resourceful rodents . also build canals to float building materials that are too heavy or . unwieldy for them to haul over land. It's through this natural tendency to build waterworks that beavers are a benefit to the woodlands where they are native. Their . building efforts sponge up floodwaters, alleviate droughts and floods . (because their dams keep water on the land longer), lesson erosion, and . raise the water table, according to Beavers: Wetlands & Wildlife. Beaver's constructions also act as the 'earth's kidneys' to purify water because silt collects upstream of older beaver dams, and toxic chemicals, such as pesticides, are broken down by microbes in the wetlands created. That means that water downstream of dams is cleaner and needs less treatment for human use. Conservation efforts: A photo issued by the Scottish Wildlife Trust of a beaver kit with an adult after the creatures were reintroduced to Knapdale Forest, Mid-Argyll, in recent years . Populations of Eurasian beaver are recovering, aided by conservation efforts, after the species was nearly hunted to extinction in Europe for its fur and for scent gland secretions once believed to have healing qualities. Because of these pressures, the beaver became extinct in Great Britain in the sixteenth century. However, several thousand now live on the Elbe, the Rhone and in parts of Scandinavia, and they have been reintroduced in Scotland, Bavaria, Austria, Netherlands, Serbia, Denmark and Bulgaria.","Beavers were once hunted almost to extinction in Europe for their fur .

Huge amounts of cheap fish are being passed off in Britain as more expensive varieties as consumers fall victim to a 'murky and complex' cost-cutting scam, new research revealed today. Seven per cent of cod and haddock - the staple of British fish and chips - are being mislabelled in supermarkets, shops and restaurants in a worrying parallel to the horsemeat scandal. A similar study in the Republic of Ireland found that as much as a quarter of products were actually completely different species, while that figure rose to as much as a third across Europe as a whole. Widespread deception: Seven per cent of fish being sold as cod and haddock in Britain are actually cheaper varieties, new research has found . In the United States, around the same proportion served in New York restaurants were not what they said on the menu. Scientists who have studied the issue believe mislabelling of fish is too widespread not to be fraud. Dr Stefano Mariani, a biologist at the University of Salford in the north of England, which conducted one of the studies, told the BBC: 'We noted that there were some suppliers that were consistently handling fish that was proven to be mislabelled, which suggests that a lot of mislabelling occurs before the fish gets delivered to the supermarket. 'Consumers should be able to go to a shop and know they are eating what they paid for.' He found that cod in Britain and Ireland . was being substituted with cheaper fish like pollock and Vietnamese . pangasius, which is farmed in estuaries in South-East Asia. More transparency needed: Researchers are now calling fopr tougher regulation and more effective labelling, so that fish can be sourced and traced . Much of the world's supply of frozen fish is produced in China which means that most of Europe's produce is flown into a Frankfurt airport rather than arriving by boat. Ominously, the firm that tests the fish there,  Eurofins laboratory in Hamburg is finding some species that have never been in food chain before. Its Director of Scientific Development, Dr Bert Popping said: 'The authorities at the airport in Frankfurt have found some new species - species which have not been caught previously; fish species which have not previously entered the food chain; which have not previously been commercialised'. Researchers are now calling for tougher regulation and more effective labelling, so that fish can be sourced and traced. The horsemeat food-labelling scandal began when Irish food inspectors announced in mid-January that they had found horse in frozen beef- burgers made by firms in Ireland and Britain, and sold by a number of supermarket chains including Tesco, Iceland, Aldi and Lidl. Since then, a growing number of stores and companies across Europe, including Findus and Nestle, have recalled beef ready-meals after tests found they contained horse DNA. Minced beef supplied to hundreds of hospitals, schools, hotels and care homes by caterer 3663 was also recalled because of horsemeat contamination.","Mislabelling a worrying parallel to horsemeat scandal .

The mother of two children allegedly murdered by their nanny spoke of her grief in public for the first time - and said that her ‘entire existence was shattered’. Marina Krim said that she ‘lost two of my best friends’ when she found daughter Lulu, six, and two-year-old son Leo stabbed to death at the family's Manhattan apartment last October. She lamented the loss of her ‘simple, charming old life’ focused on her children and said that she now struggles to see the ‘magic in the present every day’. Mrs Krim, 36, laid out her utter . devastation in a letter that was read to 150 guests at a Manhattan . charity event in honor of her late children on Saturday. Devastation: Marina Krim, pictured with husband Kevin, said that she lost two of her best friends following the murder of her son and daughter last year . Among those attending the event was Mrs Krim's husband Kevin Krim, 37, a CNBC executive. It is not thought that the couple's surviving daughter Nessie, three, was at the event. The little girl only survived the attack because she was out with her mother at the time. The Krim’s nanny Yoseyln Ortega, 50, was last week ruled fit to stand trial and will now face a jury for two counts of first-degree murder and two counts of second-degree murder. Mrs Krim’s letter, which was not read by her, said: ‘Five months ago, on an ordinary October day in New York City, I lost two of my best friends, my six-year-old daughter Lulu and my two-year-old son Leo. ‘Nessie our middle child, just three years old at the time, became an only child. My entire existence was shattered. Tragic loss: Lulu, aged six (pictured right) and two-year-old Leo (center) were killed at their New York City home last year. Their sister Nessie (left), who was with her mother at the time, survived . ‘My simple charming old life, from the moment I woke up till the moment I went to sleep, revolved around my kids and I was extremely proud of that.' The event was in support of the Lulu & Leo Fund which they have set up to raise money for children’s education programs. Mrs Krim’s letter said: ‘Kids live in the present and we should too. My most magical moments with Lulu and Leo almost never involved material items. 'It was the look of pride I would see on Lulu's face when I would pick her up from art class. It was watching Leo's deep brown curious eyes track a caterpillar in the grass. ‘My most important challenge is to remember and see the magic in the present every day.’ When Mrs Krim returned to her Upper West Side apartment on the day of the killing, she was confronted with an unimaginable sight. Her two slain children were lying in the bath covered in blood and Ortega had stabbed herself. Fit for trial: Yoselyn Ortega, 50, pictured in court in March, was deemed mentally fit to stand trial over the murders of the two Krim children . In the letter Mrs Krim said: ‘She [Ortega] did a horrible, horrible thing. We just want justice - that's all we can hope for.’ The Krim family have until now used other ways to speak about their grief and have not appeared in public. One day after the tragedy Mr Krim wrote in a text message to friends that they were ‘obviously heartbroken’.

The Florida couple suspected of kidnapping their two sons from the woman's parents are in Cuba, authorities said Monday. The Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office received information that the Hakken family had arrived on the island nation, according to a news release. Investigators say they're working with the FBI and the U.S. State Department to verify their reports.It wasn't immediately clear what, if anything, authorities could do to retrieve the family from Cuba. An email seeking comment from the State Department wasn't returned. 'Armed and dangerous': Joshua Hakken, 35, . (pictured left) and his wife Sharyn, 34, (right) are believed to have . tried an abduction before in Louisiana . International incident: Police are now trying to figure out where in Cuba the family is hiding out . The sheriff's office alleges that . Joshua Michael Hakken entered his mother-in-law's house north of Tampa . early last Wednesday, tied her up and fled with his sons, 4-year-old . Cole and 2-year-old Chase. Federal, state and local authorities . had been searching by air and sea for a boat Hakken recently bought. The . Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office confirmed Friday that the . 35-year-old father  recently bought a . 25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat with a blue hull with the word 'Salty' painted on it and white paw prints on both sides. The boat's whereabouts . are unknown. An inspection of a similar watercraft . shows that Hakken likely bought it with the kidnapping in mind, as it . has enough room to easily fit four people on board. A man who owns a similar boat told . local station WTSP that there is a bed space, a stove and plenty of . storage room for food and water. Abducted: Chase Hakken, aged two, (left) and his . four-year-old brother Cole (right) were snatched by their . 'anti-government' parents from their grandparents' home in Tampa, . Florida on Tuesday morning . Clue: Officials searching for Cole and Chase Hakken came across the black 2006 GMC pickup belonging to the boys' father on the second floor of the John's Pass garage in Madeira Beach . New twist: Officials say suspected kidnapper Joshua Hakken recently bought a 25-foot 1972 Morgan sailboat with a blue hull, and they suspect he and his family are on it now . 'This boat sails so well that one man can single-hand it in almost any conditions,' said owner Jim DeSanto. 'I don't think it's an accident. If he had this planned out, it wasn't an accident,' DeSanto said of Hakken's decision to pick that particular model of boat. The truck that Hakken, his wife . Sharyn and the boys had been traveling in was found late Thursday, . abandoned in a parking garage in Madeira Beach. Authorities say they had been looking . up and down the entire Gulf coast from Pensacola to the Keys and the . Intracoastal Waterway. By land and by sea: The hull of the boat has the word 'Salty' painted on it and white paw prints on both sides (left), and officials believe the Hakkens planned all along to use the vessel in the abduction plot . Last sighting: The family were seen sailing in their boat underneath the John¿s Pass Bridge towards the Gulf of Mexico after ditching their truck . An Amber Alert for the boys has been issued in Florida, Louisiana and other states as part of standard kidnapping protocols. The boys had been living since last year with their maternal grandparents, who were granted permanent custody Tuesday. Joshua Hakken lost custody of his . sons last year after a drug possession arrest in Louisiana, and he later . tried to take them from a foster home at gunpoint, authorities have . said. According to Louisiana police, . maternal grandmother Patricia Hauser noticed that her son-in-law had a . gun when he came to her house to kidnap the children, and before he left . she heard him say: . 'Phase one completed. Ready for phase two.' Crime scene: Officials say Joshua Hakken entered a home in the 14000 block of Shady Shores Drive owned by his sons' maternal grandmother, tied up the woman and abducted the boys . Wanted: Law enforcement officers stand in front of the home of Joshua Hakken at 3609 Sterling Avenue in Tampa as a K-9 dog searches the perimeter of the home . Authorities have previously characterized the Hakkens as 'anti-government.' 'These are not dumb people. They're very intelligent people with some emotional issues,' Hillsborough Sheriff's spokesman Larry McKinnon said. 'Our goal is to still resolve this peacefully.' Court documents released Friday state . that Mr Hakken has previously planned to commit suicide and discussed . taking 'a journey to Armageddon,' The Tampa Bay Times previously reported. The sheriff's office issued a warrant . for the arrest of Joshua Hakken, who faces two counts of kidnapping, . two counts child neglect, two counts false imprisonment, one count . burglary with a battery and one count grand theft auto.","Joshua and Sharyn Hakken kidnapped their sons from her mother's house .

A former Moulin Rouge showgirl who cheated the benefits system to fund a lavish globe-trotting lifestyle has been ordered to pay back almost £40,000. Disgraced mother-of-two Dawn Orton, 47, returned to the UK from Spain in January and was jailed for 12 months after being convicted of benefit fraud in her absence at Hull Crown Court. Now the former showgirl, who enjoyed 41 holidays during her 13 years of fraudulent claiming, has been ordered to pay back £38,320.87 within six months - or face another year behind bars. Orton had fled to Malaga with her . lover to avoid her trial at Hull Crown Court, but eventually returned to . the UK in January with an international arrest warrant hanging over her . head. She was convicted in . her absence of benefit fraud amounting to £29,000 after claiming . widowed mothers' allowance over the 13 year period. She had failed to . declare that she was in a relationship. It subsequently emerged that Orton . had claimed thousands in incapacity benefit for an injured shoulder - . despite having frequented a badminton club and enjoyed ski trips and . scuba diving with sharks. Speaking . at Hull Crown Court this week, Recorder Brian Cox QC said: 'I declare . the benefit sum is £38,320.87. There will be six months to repay it.' While hiding out in Spain Orton, of Cottingham, East Yorkshire, had written to the court to say she was on holiday. She was convicted of benefit fraud in her absence. Cheat: Orton, 47, who was jailed in January after being convicted of benefit fraud, once performed at venues across Europe, including the famed Moulin Rouge in Paris . Orton flew home and handed herself over to police after reading the Mail’s website and discovering a warrant was out for her arrest. Judge Jeremy Richardson QC previously told her: 'I brand you an extremely foolish woman. You have brought this on yourself. 'You decided to bury your head in the sand. You were in Spain with your new lover and you elected to prioritise your relationship with him ahead of your responsibility in coming to this court.' When her husband died in 1996, Orton was given the chance to claim widowed mothers’ allowance instead of incapacity benefit as it was a larger sum. But, within a year, she had moved in with her new partner Mark Lissimore in Cottingham and failed to declare she was no longer single. Jet-set to jail-time: Orton, seen left  in Gran Canaria in 1998, is now in prison for benefit fraud . After 13 years of living with Mr Lissimore, she eloped to the US with a new partner and her offending came to light. Orton then moved to Spain and refused to return for her trial. Mr Lissimore, a former Cottingham shopkeeper, attended court to see his former partner jailed in January. He said: 'We were together for 13 years and I never knew about this. She told me she was off on a short holiday and never came back. 'All these brown envelopes started arriving and, finally, I opened them and discovered this.' Fraud: Mother of two Orton, now 47, is pictured on holiday in Egypt back in 2005 . Orton was convicted of defrauding the taxpayer out of £29,000, which was the difference between the incapacity benefit she was originally claiming and the widowed mothers’ allowances she had illegally obtained. The Department of Work and Pensions is now investigating her incapacity claims. The court heard she has claimed more than £100,000 for incapacity benefit for her shoulder injury, despite playing sports and skiing. Under the proceeds of crime act, she will now have to sell her assets and use her savings to repay the money she falsely claimed from the public purse.","Dawn Orton, 47, used taxpayers' cash to help fund 41 holidays in 13 years .

A woman who provided key testimony in a murder trial that sent a man to prison for life for killing a young mother and stabbing her son has now claimed that she lied in court. Loretta Spencer Blatz has filed two affidavits in Cobb County, Georgia admitting that much of what she said in the cases against Waseem Daker in 1996 and 2012 was untrue. In the first trial, Daker was convicted of stalking Spencer Blatz and served 10 years. In the second, he was found guilty of killing her then-housemate in October 1995 after 'new evidence' emerged. Spencer Blatz sobbed during television interviews and gave emotional testimony in the trial last year, becoming shrill as she faced Daker, who represented himself in court. Scroll down for video . 'Liar': Loretta Spencer Blatz, pictured sobbing on ABC last year as she described the treatment she suffered at the hands of Waseem Daker, has now said her testimony in his trial was false . 'It's really . inappropriate that you stalk me and harass me, and you're sitting here . asking me questions, and I have to come back and answer your . questions,' she said. 'That's hard for me.' But now the affidavits say Daker never harassed or threatened to kill her, as she had claimed, and that she had spent time with him willingly ahead of his first conviction, ABC News reported. 'Waseem Daker never assaulted me or threatened me with a handgun, nor . did he ever put a gun to my head on July 25, 1995, or July 26, 1995, or . any other date or occasion,' she wrote. She added that she lied after suffering from 'anxiety, depression, manic episodes' and while she was taking painkillers, muscle relaxants and 'other substance' last year. Convicted: Daker, pictured at his case last year, was found guilty of stalking her and murdering her rommate . Victims: Karmen Smith was killed and her five-year-old son Nick was stabbed multiple times in 1995 . But based on her testimony and new DNA evidence, Daker was convicted of killing Spencer Blatz's roommate Karmen Smith and attacking her five-year-old son, Nick, in 1995. Prosecutors had claimed that Daker had killed Smith as revenge against Spencer Blatz after she told police he had been harassing her. Daker had long been a suspect in the murder, but he was only charged after hairs found on Smith's body matched his DNA in 2009. But in her affidavits, Spencer Blatz also shot this down, claiming that a blanket found at the crime scene with his hairs on was one Spencer Blatz had owned when she was spending time with Daker. He had used the blanket at her old . apartment and when she moved in with Smith, she gave the blanket to the . woman, explaining why his DNA might be on it, and her body. Recovery: Prosecutors said that Daker had attacked the Smiths out of revenge for Spencer Blatz reporting to police that he had stalked her. She now denies she was harrased or threatened . Enduring pain: Nick Smith sobbed in court last year as he recounted the 1995 attack that killed his mother . Daker was found guilty last year of murder, burglary and aggravated battery and stalking, and was sentenced to life plus 47.5 years behind bars. His lawyers told ABC that Spencer Blatz wrote to Daker in prison to tell him that she was coming clean and now he is already demanding a new trial. 'I don't think he's shocked,' his attorney Jason Treadaway told the Marietta Daily Journal. He 'knew [her testimony] was a lie when he heard it. He's the least surprised of anybody.' But prosecutors are uncertain that the denials will be taken seriously. Cobb Assistant District Attorney . Jesse Evans, who prosecuted the case, told the Marietta Daily Journal . that he is unaware of any legal reason to believe the conviction will be . overturned. Demand: Attorneys said Daker is seeking a new trial, but prosecutors said there will not necessarily be one . He said Daker is not entitled to a new trial and that he still believes there is 'overwhelming' evidence of guilt. 'This case was not about Ms. Spencer,' Evans told the Daily Journal. 'She was but the backdrop to explain why the defendant would perpetrate the murder of Karmen Smith and the brutal assault on Nick Smith, persons who would otherwise be strangers to him.' He added that she had admitted she has become unstable since the trial and had encouraged her to seek professional help. See below for video .

A Missouri family is celebrating giving birth to rare identical triplets, bringing their family to seven.

'Everyone has a signature colour,' Laura, from Des Peres, told MailOnline. 'Pink for Scarlett, purple for Sylvia and yellow for Sonja, and they have corresponding outfits. 'A . friend is even getting me non-toxic nail polish for their toenails so that . way we know for sure who's who in the middle of the night or during a . bath.' Bundles of joy: Laura and Brad Partridge show off their identical triplets, Scarlett, Sylvia and Sonja . Who's who? Scarlett wears pink, Sylvia purple and Sonja yellow as the parents struggle to tell them apart . The babies will remain in intensive care at Mercy Children's Hospital . until they have reached certain feeding and weight goals, which doctors . believe will be around their original due date of May 10. Despite being born seven weeks early, they all weighed three pounds and are doing well. 'We are doing excellently,' said 34-year-old Laura, who left hospital a week ago. 'We are overjoyed that every one is so well.' The . Partridges, who also have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a . 17-month-old daughter, Stella, had feared that the story would not be . such a happy one. Peaceful: Scarlett Partridge rests at Mercy St. Louis Hospital on Tuesday alongside her sisters . Nap time: Like her sisters, Sylvia Partridge weighed over three pounds when she was born 7 weeks early . Baby steps: Sonja and her sisters will be able to leave the hospital in several weeks once their weight is up . Laura found out that she was pregnant with triplets during her eight-week scan. She and her husband conceived the babies without the use of fertility treatments. 'The doctor said, ""There's one... There's . two..."" I was like, ""What!"",' she said. 'I honestly don't even remember her telling . me about the third. They were sharing one placenta so we knew they would . be identical.' The only multiple births on either side of the family are Brad's grandmother's twin sisters. After their initial shock subsided, the Partridges grew concerned about the dangers. 'They told us the scary statistics,' she said. 'We weren't able to celebrate like we were with our other two children. I think it . really wasn't until they were actually born that I could relax.' Growing: Laura and Brad already have a three-year-old son, Stephen, and a 17-month-old daughter, Stella. Laura was on bed rest in hospital for three weeks before they welcomed their little sisters . Brotherly love: Stephen was originally overwhelmed by the hospital but can't wait to see his sisters again . The family is now overjoyed at getting to know the new additions; Laura said that as well as being identical, they're even alike in personality and take it in turns to have a 'feisty' day. The couple introduced their other children to the . babies on Easter Sunday; the siblings are only allowed to the intensive care unit of the . hospital once due to their own young ages. 'It was a bit overwhelming for my . son,' Laura said of Stephen. 'He covered his eyes when he saw the babies because . there were machines and tubes around. 'But he thought it was neat that they weren't crying and always talks about going to visit them at the hospital again.' The likelihood of having identical triplets is unknown, but some estimates range from one in 60,000 births to one in 200 million. Delicate: Laura has returned home but the girls will remain in intensive care for several more weeks . Colour code: The family plans on painting the babies' toenails in the colours to make bath time easier . Support: The Partridges said family, friends and neighbors have rallied around to help out . Obstetrician Dr. Gilbert Webb said the Partridge trio are only the third set of triplets he has seen in his 27-year career. 'It is extremely rare to have three babies share the same placentas,' he said. 'I'm so happy for Laura and Brad that their beautiful new babies are doing well.' Laura said relatives, neighbours and church friends are waiting at home, keen to help with the babies. Many have prepared them meals for when they return from long days at the hospital. 'Everyone has been wonderful,' she said - and the love is paying off. 'They are all doing very well,' Brad added of his baby girls.

Mystery: Dr. Dennis Olvera was found dead by his son but friends say he would not have killed himself . Family members have been left stumped after a doctor and his adult son were found shot dead in a Utah national park, in a tragedy police believe could be a double suicide. Father-of-three Dennis Olvera, 65, from Pennsylvania, and his son Aarron Olvera, 40, from Arizona, were found dead in the Maze area of Canyonlands National Park on Saturday. Police are investigating the deaths of the men, who were both found shot in the mouth, as a possible double-suicide. They said there could also be a possibility that it was a murder suicide. Garfield County Sheriff Danny . Perkins told the Salt Lake Tribune that the gun found between their bodies was registered to . one of the men but would not say to which one. He also would not reveal which man was holding the gun but said there were no signs of a struggle before the deaths.. 'Everything we have come across so far - . all the evidence from our investigation and from the medical examiner's . office - indicates that this was a suicide,' he said. Deaths: Aaron Olvera, 40, and his father Dennis Olvera, 65, have been found shot dead in the Maze area of Canyonlands National Park in Utah with a single gun between their bodies . Yet some things just do not add up, he added to the Salt Lake Tribune. Neither . men had ever indicated he wanted to kill himself to family members or . friends, and the two apparently had plans to return to their homes. They . were carrying ample food and water, had already booked accommodation at . a motel for the end of the trip and had beer in their pickup truck, . Perkins said. They also had bought return flights. 'I think something happened out there that was not planned,' he said. The investigation is continuing; . police are still looking for their base camp and hope to gain access to a . locked mobile phone which they found at the scene. The . elder Olvera's business partner and friend of 25 years, Doug Dugger, . told the Tribune that 'there's no way' he shot himself as 'he thought . suicide was a weakness'. Questions: Authorities are investigating whether it was a double-suicide or a murder-suicide . He was the vice president of . Developmental Services Alternatives Inc., which offers treatment for . people with mental disabilities, and was known locally as an expert on difficult behavioural issues. Dugger added that while he did not . know Aarron Olvera as well, he said that relatives had told him that it . was also unlikely that the man would kill himself. But Perkins said it appeared no one else was at the scene apart from the Olveras. 'We're convinced there was nobody there besides the two individuals,' he said. Both men were visiting the park from . out of state and had been dead for a few days by the time they were . found in Lou's Springs at the national park, which is about 250 miles . south of Salt Lake City. Authorities had began searching for the father and son after a relative reported they had failed to return from their hike. The bodies have been sent for autopsies and  toxicology tests, but authorities said they are uncertain they will yield any more answers about how exactly the deaths unfolded.

A mother whose 14-year-old daughter committed suicide after being bullied for two years has read out the girl's heart-wrenching suicide note to senators in a bid to pass an anti-bullying bill. Danielle Green shared the letter written by her daughter Angelina 'Angel' Green with the Senate Education Committee in Indianapolis on Wednesday. 'To all the bullies that have called me . names, [you] are the reason why I am feeling the way I am now,' the handwritten note reads. 'I . didn’t want to die. I just wanted to be saved from the pain.' The bill, which sets a new definition for bullying to include electronic taunts and helps schools know how to identify it and react, was approved in the state Senate on Wednesday with 8-2 votes. Tragedy: Angel Green, 14, hanged herself in March after enduring two years of bullying at school . It will now be debated and voted upon in the full Senate and, if successful, it will be signed into law. Danielle Green has been a key figure in the battle; Angel had asked her mother to seek justice in her suicide note. The eighth-grade student was found hanged on a tree by a bus stop on March 5. Her mother said Angel chose the spot because she knew her tormenters would see her. She had been bullied for two years over her red hair, her freckles and her weight, her mother said. Angel was even the victim of intimidation at home and after her father was arrested for assaulting her, this information was used by the bullies to torment the girl, too. Battle: Her mother, Danielle, spoke about Angel's struggle to senators in a bid to pass an anti-bullying bill . Heartwrenching: Angel wrote this suicide note to her mother revealing her pain - and her love for her . The bill going through the Indiana Senate: . Source: IndyStar . 'They called her names. They pushed her. They tripped her in school. They have thrown food and trash at her . during school,' Green said, the IndyStar reported. The treatment eventually led to tragedy when Green found her daughter was missing and heard that someone had been found hanging from a tree - Angel. Before her death, the teenager addressed one note to her classmates and also scrawled one to her mother. 'I'm really sorry that I did this,' the note, which Danielle shared with RTV6, said. 'Don't you EVER think it was your fault. Because it's not. I love you so much and I couldn't ask for a better mum... 'But my heart can't take this pain... It's bullying that killed me. Please get justice.' After . reading the note to the classmates aloud and learning that her battle had been . successful, Green said: 'My daughter's story is now heard. It gives my . Angel wings.' She said that she had raised her concerns repeatedly with her daughter's school, but that nothing was ever done to help her. Under the bill, bullying is defined as overt, . repeated acts or gestures - made verbally or over the internet - that . create a hostile school environment for the student, the IndyStar . reported. Tormented: Angel killed herself in a place where her bullies would see her body, her mother said . The treatment can lead the student to . fear they will be harmed or interferes with the student's physical or . mental health, or their performance at school, the definition notes. The bill also outlines procedures for the schools on how to deal with complaints of bullying, including reporting to parents or law enforcement and discipline procedures. It also requires training for teachers and lessons for students on bullying prevention. Before the bill was passed, conservative groups had expressed concern that the bill could infringe on rights of free speech and religion and drafted an amendment for the bill, which was adopted. Before she committed suicide, Angelina Green wrote suicide notes - one addressed to her classmates, and another for her mother. This is what she wrote to her mother: . Dear Mum, . I'm really sorry that I did this. Don't you EVER think it was your fault. Because it's not. I love you so much and I couldn't ask for a better mum. Thank you for caring and feeding and loving me for 14 years. I'm sorry once again. But my heart can't take this pain. I'm gonna miss you so much. I love you.

Mrs Harding, 52, died when the car she was a passenger in was hit by a train in the village of Moreton-on-Lugg in Herefordshire in January 2010. Her husband Mark, who was driving the car, suffered serious injuries in the collision, which happened seconds after Maund raised the crossing's barriers in the mistaken belief that the train had already passed. A two-week trial heard that Network Rail had opted not to fit a safety system at the crossing which would have prevented the barriers being lifted when a train was approaching.

Preparatory technical flights are now underway ahead of the 2013 Across America mission, due to get underway on May 1. The timing of each leg of the journey will be dependent on meteorological conditions, but the aircraft is scheduled to make stopovers in Phoenix in Arizona, Dallas in Texas, and Atlanta, Georgia or St Louis, Missouri, before carrying on to Washington DC and New York.

Shocking: Shaniece Dobson, 21, stabbed Sean Martin, also 21, during an argument in her living room . A young woman was yesterday found guilty of killing her boyfriend by stabbing him in the chest during a jealous row about him contacting an ex-girlfriend. Shaniece Dobson killed Sean Martin with a single stab wound after bickering with him at her home. Advocate depute Shanti Maguire, prosecuting, described the killing as ‘cruel and callous’. The jury at the High Court in Livingston heard that Dobson, of Motherwell, Lanarkshire, killed Mr Martin in front of his horrified young brother and sister after arguing with him in the living room of her high-rise flat in Coatbridge, Lanarkshire. Ann Martin, 17, and her 15-year-old brother Paul said they saw Dobson attack 21-year-old Mr Martin in a jealous rage after she caught him on his mobile phone to an ex-girlfriend. Dobson, 21, went to the kitchen, grabbed a large knife and returned to plunge it into Mr Martin’s chest, they said. The seven-and-a-half inch blade pierced both lungs and sliced open  his windpipe and his main artery, the aorta. Mr Martin collapsed and died within minutes from massive blood loss from internal injuries. It emerged in evidence that Mr  Martin, of Coatbridge, had only been arranging for his former girlfriend to take his dog. Barefoot and covered in her boyfriend’s blood, Dobson fled to a friend’s flat in a tower block, where she was later detained by police. Dobson was accused of murder but was found guilty of the lesser crime of culpable homicide. She had tendered a plea of guilty to culpable homicide at the beginning of the trial but the Crown refused to accept it and sought a murder conviction. Fury: Dobson, pictured left outside court, grabbed a knife from the kitchen and plunged it into Mr Martin’s chest . The jury took more than five hours to return a majority verdict of guilty to culpable homicide. Dobson was remanded in custody for the preparation of social work and  psychiatric reports and will be sentenced later. Distress: She fled to a friend's home, barefoot and covered in blood . The trial was held twice after it was abandoned last week by the Crown in ‘bizarre’ circumstances. A member of the public, who had reported at Livingston police station for jury service, was mistakenly allowed to take a real juror’s place on the second day of proceedings. Senior judge Lord Boyd apologised to the families of both the accused and the victim for being forced to halt the first trial and appoint a new jury. He said: ‘I appreciate that the abandonment of the trial will have added to your anxieties as to the outcome. ‘To the family of Sean Martin particularly, it will have been a particularly difficult time for you. ‘Not only have you lost a son and a brother but the abandonment of last week’s proceedings meant that two young people – Ann and Paul Martin – had to give evidence twice, reliving what, for them, must have been a horrific experience.’ Lord Boyd added: ‘The circumstances which led to the desertion were bizarre and unique. I have to say nobody has come across them before. ‘The circumstances which arose last week should not have happened and I extend to you the apologies of the court for that.’","She grabbed a large knife from kitchen and plunged it into his chest .

Fenn II, 20, of Polk City, Pennsylvania, Lance Cpl. William T Wild IV, 21, of Anne Arundel, Maryland,  Lance Cpl Mason J. Vanderwork of Hickory, North Carolina and Cpl Aaron J. Ripperda, 26, of Madison, Illinois. Living his dream: Pfc Josh Martino had wanted to be a Marine since he saw a TV special about the Marine Corps when he was a boy . Lance Cpl Taylor was engaged to be married, and had a wedding planned for May. His fiancee's father called him an exceptional person. Keith Malone told The Marietta Times: 'You don't meet many young men like him today. He was respectful to everyone, very humble, just happy, happy all the time.' Friend Christian Gentry added: 'You don't find people like him... Why would this happen to someone as great as Josh was? He had given so much into the Marines and [his] family.' Taylor is also survived by three sisters and a brother. Muchnick, who'd been in the Marines for about three years, had served in Afghanistan. He played high school lacrosse and football in Westport, and later played lacrosse at Eastern Connecticut State University, where he studied business. He was considering a return to college after his enlistment. In a biography on the university's website, Muchnick said the one thing he would like to do before he died was 'live,' and his most embarrassing moment was getting caught lip-synching in a school talent show. His grandfather, Jerome Muchnick, said: 'He was at the top of his game when this happened. You can't imagine losing a very handsome, 23-year-old grandson who was vital and loving.' Pfc Martino had aspired to be a Marine since he was a boy, when he saw a TV special on the Marine Corps. His mother Karen Perry said: 'Since he was probably 8 years old, he wanted to be a Marine. That's all he wanted to do.' Martino was a talkative former high school athlete and accomplished hunter who hoped to marry his fiancee later this year, Perry said. His mother said she first heard a radio news report about the Monday accident, then three Marines arrived at her workplace to say her son was among the seven dead.

Marine officers from the base, who arrived at the Hawthorne Army Depot on Tuesday, could not attend the memorial, as they began the task of figuring out what caused a mortar shell to explode in its firing tube. The accident prompted the Pentagon to restrict the use of the weapons until an investigation can determine their safety, officials said. The explosion on Monday night at the sprawling facility during an exercise involved the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force from Camp Lejeune. Seven men were killed and eight were injured, officials said. A Navy corpsman is among the injured. Hawthorne has been an important installation in American military history since World War II, when it was the staging area for ammunition, bombs and rockets. Historic: Hawthorne has held an important place in U.S. military history since World War II when it became the staging area for ammunition, bombs and rockets .

Area: The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles. It is located about 140 miles away from Reno . The facility has downsized in recent years but still serves as a munitions repository and disposal site, along with being a training facility for troops as they take advantage of terrain and climate similar to places like Afghanistan. The facility is made up of hundreds of buildings spread over more than 230 square miles, and bunkers dot the sagebrush-covered hills visible from the highway. Even though the Marines were from the other side of the country, locals still feel a strong sense of pride in the military because the town's history is so deeply tied to the armed forces.

An Indian dentist who died after a miscarriage was told she could not have an abortion in Ireland because a doctor told her 'this is a Catholic country', her widower claimed. Savita Halappanavar was 17 weeks pregnant when admitted to University Hospital Galway on October 21 last year and died a week later from suspected septicaemia, days after she lost her baby. The 31-year-old's widower, Praveen, told an inquest that they repeatedly requested a potentially life-saving termination but were refused because the foetal heartbeat was present. Consultant Dr Katherine Astbury . reportedly told the couple: 'We are bound by the law. We cannot . terminate the foetus when it’s still alive’ Widowed: Praveen Halappanavar, the husband of Savita Halappanavar, arrives for the inquest into her death at Galway Coroners court . Dentist Savita Halappanavar died of septicaemia a week after miscarrying 17 weeks into her pregnancy. Her husband Praveen Halappanavar is now looking for answers . Mr Halappanavar said his wife cried and told the doctor she was Hindu and not an Irish citizen, but Dr Astbury just told the couple that she was 'sorry'. The widower told the inquest his wife was in a great deal of pain and in shock after being told that the foetus was still alive. When he arrived for the first day of evidence, Mr Halappanavar said the last few days had been difficult as the couple's baby had been due on March 30 - the day he was handed a health service report into his wife's death. 'We have faith in the inquest, so hopefully we will get the answers,' he said. 'The big question is why was Savita treated the way she was not supposed to be? We just want to know why she died.' The inquest at the courthouse in Galway city is scheduled to last at least a week. Medics involved in the treatment Mrs Halappanavar will be called to give evidence along with experts including former master of the National Maternity Hospital Dr Peter Boylan. Seeking answers: Praveen Halappanavar (second left) and his solicitor Gerard O'Donnell (second right) arrive for the inquest . Proud: The couple were at the heart of the Indian community in Galway and married in 2007 . Mr Halappanavar has insisted that an abortion was refused during the miscarriage and at one point the couple were told it was because Ireland 'is a Catholic country'. The widower said: 'All I want is to get to the bottom of it, to the truth, so (I’m) looking forward to it.' Mr Halappanavar said he could feel his late wife’s presence. Probe: Coroner Dr Ciaran McLoughlin arrives for the inquest into the death of Mrs Halappanavar at Galway Coroners court . 'She has always been there and it always feels that she has been there and I get the strength from her,' he said. 'It’s going to be a very tough day. The last few days have been very rough.' He added: 'I’ve been confident right from day one that we will get to the truth, I want the truth, so we will just have to wait and see.' More than 50 statements have been furnished by health chiefs and gardai for the coroner, Dr Ciaran MacLoughlin. Mr Halappanavar, a 34-year-old engineer at Boston Scientific in Galway, has so far refused to co-operate with separate investigations by the Health Information and Quality Authority (Hiqa) and the Health Service Executive’s clinical review. Lawyers have not ruled out taking the Irish Government to the European courts in pursuit of a public inquiry after the inquest. Mr Halappanavar was said to be unsatisified with the draft findings of the HSE’s clinical review, which was handed to him on Good Friday. It revealed there was an over-emphasis on the need not to intervene while there was a foetal heartbeat and that staff failed to recognise and diagnose the life-threatening infection in time. It also reportedly found confusion among medical teams on the interpretation of Irish law on abortion. The HSE has apologised over the treatment given to Mrs Halappanavar. Opening the inquest in the packed courtroom, Dr MacLoughlin extended his sympathies and condolences to Mr Halappanavar and his family in India and vowed to undertake the inquiry with respect, courtesy and dignity in memory of his wife . He told the jury of six men and five women that the inquest was a fact-finding exercise, with no prosecution or defence. Anger: Abortion rights protesters bearing pictures of Savita Halappanavar marched through central Dublin shortly after her death . He said more than 60 statements, . including some from hospital staff, gardai, pathologists, a consultant . obstetrician and a microbiologist had been taken, but not all would . appear as witnesses. 'Savita died in tragic circumstances,' Dr MacLoughlin said. 'The family of Savita, in the presence of her husband, have suffered a very traumatic experience.' The . coroner asked for sensitivity, time and understanding to be shown by . everyone as if they themselves had been bereaved in similar . circumstances. Mr Halappanavar is listed as the fourth witness to give evidence. As Mr Halappanavar prepared to give . evidence, the coroner revealed that the widower had called him from . India while attending his wife’s funeral to ask him to investigate her . death. The protestors were demanding changes to Ireland's strict abortion laws, which they blamed for Mrs Halappanavar's untimely death . He gave his statement to gardai two days after he returned to Ireland amid fears that his memory would fade, the inquest heard. Mr Halappanavar read his statement to the court. He said he moved to Ireland in 2006 and a year later he married Savita in a Hindu ceremony in India. When she moved to Ireland they travelled around the country. 'She found Ireland so peaceful compared to the hustle and bustle of India,' he told the court. Mr Halappanavar said the couple had always planned to have a baby in 2012. 'It worked out well that Savita had completed her exams,' he said. 'When we found out she was pregnant in July 2012 we were delighted and she rang her friends for advice on what to do next.' Protest: There were also demonstrations in India against the Irish government over the death . He said his wife was in excellent health, athletic, did yoga, and had no need to visit a GP before her pregnancy. Mr Halappanavar said when the couple went for their first scan at the hospital in September 2012 they were told their baby was due on March 30 and that the pregnancy was doing well. 'Savita shed tears of happiness when she saw the baby on the monitor,' he said. Mr Halappanavar said from the outset of the pregnancy his wife had lower back pain, which she had suffered from since college and from standing for long periods of time while she worked as a dentist in India. His wife’s parents visited from India and held a baby shower to celebrate, but her pain got so bad that she went back to the hospital on September 20. Her blood pressure, heart rate and urine were checked. 'The doctor said there was nothing to worry about and sent us back home,' Mr Halappanavar said. 'Savita had tears in her eyes when she heard the baby was OK,' he added. 'She was anxious and was relieved when she heard the heartbeat was OK.'

A Chinese textile worker laid off from his factory job has taken up an unlikely new career - building submarines. Zhang Wuyi from Hanyang in central China's land-locked Hubei province is currently testing the functions of his latest invention. Mr Zhang has been building submarines since 2008 and in that time has created several different versions - despite having no background in engineering. Scroll down for video . Resourceful: Former textile worker Zhang Wuyi . looks up as he squats under a suction pipe of his new submarine that . captures sea cucumbers at his workshop in Wuhan, Hubei province . Final tests: Mr Zhang began his business building subs in 2008 after he was laid . off from his textile factory job - despite having no experience in engineering he has made and sold several different versions already . Incredibly, not only have his previous submarines worked as advertised, but the 38-year-old has managed to make a living selling them to fisherman and water theme parks. The former textile worker began making his first sub after the factory he worked for went bust and he was made redundant. 'I didn't known anything about submarine building, but designed with my imagination,' he said. With several fellow engineers, he has since designed and built eight miniature submarines mainly designed for harvesting aquatic products, such as sea cucumber. The wrought-iron submarines have enough room for two people, a diving depth of 66-98ft, and can travel for up to 20 hours, local media reported. Each is equipped with video cameras to observe the underwater environment and suction tubes to harvest submarine wildlife. 'Designed with imagination': With several fellow engineers, he has since designed and built eight miniature submarines mainly designed for harvesting aquatic products, such as sea cucumber . But is it safe? The wrought-iron submarines have enough room for two people, a diving depth of 66-98ft, and can travel for up to 20 hours. They are also equipped with external cameras and suction tubes . Inspiration: This time last year Mr Zhang was building his subs in a makeshift workshop in an abandoned building in his home town of Hanyang. Now his business is based at a boat yard in the regional capital Wuhan . My Wuyi's first customer was sea cucumber farmer Cong Zhijie, a fisherman in Dalian, who bought one of the contraptions in 2011 for 100,000 yuan (£10,650). 'I was brave enough to be the first user of his submersible, but that machine helped me to catch up to 50 kilograms of sea cucumbers in 40 minutes,' said Mr Zhijie. News of Mr Wuyi's incredible entrepreneurialism first broke this time last year, when Chinese media showed him working on a red-painted sub in a makeshift workshop in a disused building in Hanyang. It is a mark of his success that his latest creation, emblazoned with a patriotic red star, is being tested in a boat yard in Wuhan, the regional capital. The test operations, pictured yesterday, are taking place in an artificial pool in the boat yard.","Zhang Wuyi started building subs after he was laid off from his job in 2008 .

Over half of British men admit to trying to influence their partner’s fashion choices, according to the latest research. And it isn't because they want to boost our style credentials, the majority of these men admit that their reason for doing so was so that other men wouldn’t look at their partner. Respondents were initially asked whether or not they personally liked their partner’s fashion sense and the way they dressed, to which the majority (66 per cent) said that they did, whilst a third (34 per cent) said they did not. Key influences: Over half of men try to influence their partner's fashion choices, and it's because they don't want other men to look at us . When asked whether or not they had ever tried to influence the way their partner dressed, 51 per cent said that they had. Those respondents who admitted that they did try to influence the way their partner dressed were asked to stipulate what situation would cause them to do so, to which a cheeky 71 per cent admitted that it was on nights out when their partner was without them. While 55 per cent said it was during nights out when they were out together and 32 per cent admitted that it was when their partner was going off to work. 19 per cent of respondents claimed that they liked to voice their opinion on their partner’s dress sense ‘day-to-day’, while 11 per cent said it was during special occasions, like for weddings and birthdays. When asked their reasons for interfering with their partner’s clothing choices, a third of men admitted it was to make sure that other men wouldn’t look at their partner, while 25 per cent said it was to make sure that she looked her best and 19 per cent said it was to help her spend less on clothes and other fashion accessories. Even the ever-so-stylish Nicole Kidman has taken fashion advice from her husband and gone as far as to change her outfit based on his advice. She told Grazia Daily: 'I tend to solicit [his] opinion. I’ve actually changed when my husband said something’s not great. Evolving style: Even Nicole Kidman has taken advice from her husband and admits to changing her style since being with him . 'A lot of times, I look in the mirror . and see something different. He likes natural and he likes something . that’s “not so ‘done’ ”, which I would say speaks for a lot of men. 'I’ve definitely changed my style since I’ve been with him as well.' When asked how they would try to influence the way their partner dressed, 88 per cent of men said it tended to be by dropping subtle hints, whilst 57 per cent said they would pick outfits from their partner’s wardrobe for them and 34 per cent said they would go shopping with their partner in order to influence their style choices. But when it's the other way round, men weren't as willing to take style advice with 41 per cent saying they wouldn't want to be on the receiving end of fashion tips from their partner. Mark Pearson, Chairman of MyVoucherCodes.co.uk, who carried out the survey, said: 'We thought it would be interesting to ask men whether or not they give their partner fashion advice. 'The twist to the survey was whether or not men gave advice because they truly cared about how their partner looked or if they used it as a form of control. Subtle approach: 34 per cent of men said they would go shopping with their partner in order to influence their style choices . 'What was shocking about the results was how many men admitted that they tried to control their partner’s dress sense all because they were not comfortable with the idea of other men looking at their partner.' He added: 'If you are with someone, you should accept them completely, and this includes their personal fashion style and choices.

'We all have different ways of motivation.' While he steadfastly defended Rice, Graham did admit that players felt he often went too far with his forms of 'motivation.' If players stood up to him on the . court, Graham said, 'he would get in a heated argument.' But afterwards, . he would  calm down and pull the player aside to tell him he didn't . mean anything against him personally, but that he was just trying to be . motivational. Graham said Rice's tactics were effective on him. 'He motivated me on an off the court,' Graham said, noting that Rice pushed him to make better grades in school. Meanwhile Tim Pernetti, the Rutgers athletic . director who yesterday defended his decision to suspend and not fire Rice, has admitted that he made the wrong move. Pernetti said: 'I am responsible for . the decision to attempt a rehabilitation of Coach Rice. 'Dismissal and . corrective action were debated in December and I thought it was in the . best interest of everyone to rehabilitate, but I was wrong.' He added: 'Moving forward, I will work to regain the trust of the Rutgers community.' Fleeing: Rice is seen leaving his home in Little Silver, N.J. Wednesday after he was fired . Driven from his home: With political and social pressure mounting, the former coach left his home - which was surrounded by media - with his dog and a bag of belongings . Admission: Tim Pernetti, pictured right with Rice, has admitted that his decision to suspend Rice in December - and not fire him - was the wrong move . Pernetti was given a copy of the tape by a former employee in November and, after an independent investigator was hired to review it, Rice was suspended for three games, fined $75,000 and ordered to attend anger management classes. University President Robert Barchi agreed to the penalty. Pernetti initially said Tuesday he and Barchi viewed the video in December. The president issued a statement Wednesday, saying he didn't see it until Tuesday and then moved to fire the 44-year-old coach for repeated abusive conduct. Through a school spokesman, Pernetti backed up his president and said Barchi did not view the video until this week. 'Yesterday, I personally reviewed the video evidence, which shows a chronic and pervasive pattern of disturbing behavior,' Barchi said in a statement. 'I have now reached the conclusion that Coach Rice cannot continue to serve effectively in a position that demands the highest levels of leadership, responsibility and public accountability. He cannot continue to coach at Rutgers University.' Speaking to WABC-TV outside his home today, Rice said there is 'no excuse' for his behavior in the video, and apologized for his actions. He told the station: I've let so many people down, my players, my administration, Rutgers University, the fans, my family - who's sitting in their house, just huddled around because of the fact that their father was an embarrassment to them. It's troubling, but I hope at some time, maybe I'll try and explain it. 'But right now, there's no explanation for what's on those films, because there's no excuse for it. I was wrong. And I want to tell everybody who's believed in me that I'm deeply sorry for the pain and the hardship that I've caused.' Facing the media: Rice spoke to reporters outside his New Jersey home on Wednesday after it was learned that he had been fired . Media: A reporter stands near the front door of the home of the former Rutgers coach in Little Silver, New Jersey . Slurs: In one portion of the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You're a f***ing f****t!' The clip, obtained and released by ESPN yesterday, shows a number of disturbing and violent actions taken by Rice toward his players during team practices. At one point on the video, Rice unloads a homophobic rant against one of his players, saying: 'You f***ing fairy! You’re a f***ing f****t!' And his rants were not just limited to the verbal. The footage shows Rice grabbing, kicking and shoving players - and even hurling basketballs at them. Fired: Rice was let go by Rutgers amid a public outcry surrounding the release of the video yesterday . The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012. Murdock, a former college standout . who played with teams like the Utah Jazz and . New Jersey (now Brooklyn) Nets, was hired by Rutgers in 2010 as director . of player development. He told ESPN that it wasn't long before he reported Rice's aggressive behavior to Pernetti. But Rice was not disciplined until Murdock showed him the footage in November. A month later, Rice was suspended for three games without pay and fined. Rice returned to his duties as head coach in a game on January 2 against Syracuse. Pernetti said in an interview with . ESPN yesterday that he issued the suspension and the fine after he was shown the . tape and conducted an investigation into the matter. He said that Rice was penalized appropriately for a 'first offense.' Pernetti nor director of athletic communications Kevin Lorincz returned messages from MailOnline for comment. When asked about the suspension at the time, Pernetti said: 'I was made aware of some things within the last couple of weeks. We commenced a thorough, lengthy and fair investigation and this was the result of that investigation. 'There was obviously some things that are not to the Rutgers' standard that we evaluated and decided upon.' Whistleblower: The video was provided to ESPN by Eric Murdock, a former NBA player who also served as Rutgers' director of player development from 2010-2012 . Criticism: As the clip has spread, it has drawn a rebuke from many on social media, including NBA superstar LeBron James . After ESPN aired the videotape yesterday, a flood of anger swirled on social media with many lambasting Rutgers, including NBA superstar LeBron James and New Jersey Gov Chris Christie. After the decision was announced today, Gov Christie posted a series of tweets supporting the decision to fire Rice. He said: 'It was the right & necessary action to take in light of the conduct displayed on the videotape.' Speaking out: New Jersey Gov Chris Christie said in a series of Twitter posts that he supported Rutgers' decision to remove Rice . Murdock stayed with the team for two years until July 2012, when his contract was not renewed. Murdock claims he was fired after he reported Rice’s antics, a claim Pernetti denies. His attorney Raj Gadhok told ESPN: 'Mr Murdock was terminated for having complained of and reported illegal conduct by Mike Rice. As a result, his employment was terminated by Rutgers University. 'That’s unlawful in the state of New Jersey and Eric intends to pursue legal action for his wrongful termination, which he university and its representatives had been aware of for some time now.' When push comes to shove: Pernetti insisted yesterday that he issued an 'appropriate' suspension after he was shown the tape and conducted an investigation into the matter .","Coach Mike Rice was fired by the university after a video was released that showed him pushing, kicking and spewing homophobic remarks at players .

Aaron Schaffhausen's aunt took the stand on Monday and told the court that the killer was 'unplanned by his mom and unwanted by his dad'. Patricia Fix appeared at the trial along with Schaffhausen's mother, father and prison psychiatrist. Ms Fix also said that the family had a history of depression. Schaffhausen has admitted to killing . his three daughters - 11-year-old Amara, eight-year-old Sophie and . Cecilia, five, on July 10 last year, but claims he was not responsible . due to mental illness. Jurors will determine whether he was sane at the time of the slayings at the family's home in River Falls, Wisconsin. Aaron Schaffhausen pictured during his trial in Hudson, Wisconsin, claims he is not responsible for the murder of his three daughters due to mental illness . His father also testified during the second week of trial that Aaron was a difficult baby who did not like to be touched. Roger Schaffhausen testified that his son Aaron was a rebellious and belligerent teen who had some 'run-ins with the law'. The elder Schaffhausen says his son stole a gun, brought it to high school and was expelled. However he admitted that his son became a better person after marrying his wife Jessica and that he liked being a father to his three daughters. Roger Schaffhausen said that when his son's marriage broke down and his estranged wife began seeing someone else then he began to behave strangely and made deeply alarming remarks. According to Fox, Mr Schaffhausen senior said: 'There was one phone call received around . two o'clock in the morning. He was very despondent, depressed. Horror: Amara Schaffhausen, 11, Sophie Schaffhausen, 8, and Cecilia Schaffhausen, 5, were found dead in their home after their father cut their throats . 'Sounded . like he was always weeping. That he wanted to do terrible things to . Jess' boyfriend. He wanted to hurt the girls to show how much pain he . was in.' The murder suspect's mother Sue Allen told jurors that her son became extremely depressed when he and his wife Jessica broke up. She said that mental illness was common in other relatives. Ms Fix said that she had been deeply concerned that Schaffhausen was going to harm his daughters when he made phone calls to her. Dr Ralph Baker, a prison psychiatrist, also took the stand. He explained that while Shaffhausen was depressed, he did not appear to have a mental condition that would legally support an insanity defense. Baker says Schaffhausen told him what happened at the house was a 'spur of the moment thing'. Schaffhausen told Baker he tried to help Cecilia find her shoes, and the next thing he knew, he had his hands on her neck and was strangling her before then slitting his three daughters' throats. Charged: Aaron Schaffhausen, 34, of Minot, North Dakota, faces three counts of first-degree intentional homicide - each a mandatory life sentence if convicted for stabbing his three daughters to death .","Trial to decide if Schaffhausen, 35, was .

But according to the latest study, many couples have rather specific playlists - namely baby-making playlists with a variety of inspiring songs to 'get them in the mood'. The study, which asked parents to share the music they choose to accompany their more intimate moments, found that over half of broody couples listen to music whilst trying to conceive.

Of these, three quarters admitted that they did so in order to help them ‘get in the mood’. And it was Adele's awarding-winning track Someone Like You that was the number one preference for broody couples. In second place was Kings Of Leon's rock track Sex On Fire, followed by the slightly cliche R. Kelly Bump N' Grind single. Unsurprisingly, Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On made the top five and his Sexual Healing single was voted in eighth place.

Attack: One-time TV dad of the year Keith Preddie could face jail after he admitted attacking his wife . A former television dad of the year is facing jail after he admitted attacking his wife in a row over Christmas presents. Michael Jackson impersonator and father of three Keith Preddie, 44, threw a clothes horse and a plastic step at his wife Emma before pinning her to a sofa at their home in Croydon last December. Preddie, who was awarded the title of Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010, gave a long pause before breaking down in tears as he admitted assault by beating at Croydon Magistrates' Court today. Chairman of the Bench Jackie Hamblin warned Preddie he could face a spell behind bars as she adjourned the hearing for sentence next month. The performer, who wore a black suit with a white shirt and a black tie, appeared tearful throughout the hearing and was supported in court by around 15 well-wishers. Preddie was Britain's original Michael Jackson impersonator, first taking on the role of the King of Pop in 1986 and going on to perform his routine on stage and screen. He has also worked for the Family Centre in New Addington, which offers support services for local families, for the past decade. It was his work to set up an It's Time For Dad's support group at the centre that saw him crowned Britain's Best Dad by GMTV three years ago. The court heard details of Preddie's assault on his wife at the family home in Croydon, footage of which was captured on a CCTV camera at the house. Prosecutor Louise Thomas told the court how a row flared on the morning of December 18 last year after Preddie marched in to the back room of the family home where his wife was wrapping Christmas presents. 'Mr Preddie entered the room and asked her if there were any presents left over that he could give his mother,' she said. 'Mrs Preddie replied she had already given his mother a present. 'At that point Mr Preddie became angry, he shouted that he had been to a lot of shops to get a present for his mother and he got very stressed during the day looking for one.' Ms Thomas told magistrates how Mrs Preddie warned her husband she would only speak to him if he calmed down. But his anger only worsened. 'Suddenly he grabbed a washing frame which had clothing on it and he threw it at her. It landed about a foot away from her,' she said. Tears: Preddie, who has been a Michael Jackson impersonator for almost 30 years, broke down in court as he admitted assault by beating before magistrates in Croydon today . 'At that point she told him he had better calm down and grow up so he left the room. 'After a short time he re-entered the room and started shouting again. He then threw a plastic step at Mrs Preddie hitting her on her left arm,' the prosecutor said. The court was told how Mrs Preddie told her husband to get out of the room. Ms Thomas said: 'At that point she walked straight up to him and then she suddenly found herself pinned down by both arms. 'Each of the defendant's hands holding each arm. She was pinned down lying against the sofa. She shouted ""Get off me, leave me alone"". 'He then let go and she left the room. The argument caused such a commotion that it woke up their daughter,' she said. Notoriety: Preddie appeared on an episode of Come Dine With Me and was named Britain's Best Dad by GMTV in 2010 . Ms Thomas told how Mrs Preddie contacted police the following day, having already spoken to a domestic violence shelter. She added: 'On the morning of December 20 she told Mr Preddie that she had called the police and he said he knew what he had done was wrong and apologised.' After the hearing Ms Thomas explained that CCTV footage of the assault obtained by police had come . from a camera inside the house. No explanation was given as to why there . was a camera present. She also said pictures taken by Ms Preddie showed bruising to her left arm. Adjourning the hearing for sentence on April 11, Ms Hamblin said: 'The report that we will request is an all options report. That could include custody. 'We note that this offence was committed in a domestic setting and had an effect on your daughter, who was in the house. 'We found greater harm because of the sustained nature of the attack.' Preddie has appeared on an episode of the Channel 4 reality show Come Dine With Me, which saw him annoying his fellow contestants by repeatedly parroting Jacko's 'Shamone' catchphrase. He later released a pop single named Shamone, which entered the music charts in Germany. Preddie was bailed to return to the court on April 11 for sentence, when the court will also hear an application for costs and a restraining order. He was ordered not to contact his ex-wife and will only be allowed back to his old family home while accompanied by police to collect his belongings.","Keith Preddie, 44, warned he could face jail after admitting assault .

By day Lesley Ballantyne, 21, learned about nutrition but went home to gorge on kebabs, chips, pizza, fizzy drinks and chocolate cake. She ballooned to 23st and was nearly thrown out for being repeatedly late because she struggled to get upstairs for classes. But now - after slimming down to 13 stone and dropping from a size 26 to a 14 - she's in a class of her own as a trainee home economics teacher.

Lesley said: 'I didn't even know what a vegetable was - and thinking back, it was disgusting. 'I was about to be thrown out of university because I couldn't get to my classes. The walking was just too much - I couldn't cope with climbing the stairs. 'I would gorge fatty foods on a daily basis without care.

As she piled on the weight, she became depressed, sleeping up to 15 hours a day and nodding off during lectures.

Lesley realised she had to slim down when she was forced to ask for a seat belt extension on a flight when going on holiday. She visited her GP in January 2011 after feeling ill and was told by doctors the fat around her organs was endangering her health. The pounds started dropping off when she swapped her high calorie snacks for healthy meals like porridge and stir fries.

The store was among the first in Britain to introduce plus size mannequins, ban airbrushing from campaign images and use disabled models in their photoshoots. And today they took their campaign against body image tyranny one step further by becoming the first high street retailer in the UK to promote its fashion collections with a campaign so rich in diversity. The campaign turns its back on the industry norm of young, thin models, instead featuring an amputee, three models over 40 - including one nearing 70 - and a Paralympian athlete. Non-conventional: Debenhams are famous for their groundbreaking campaigns and this is their best yet . Fashionable diversity: Debenhams has unveiled its amazing new diversity campaign featuring the likes of Paralympian amputee Stefanie Reid . There is a petite model just over five foot tall, and swimwear shots celebrating curves using a model who is a size 18. Then there is Philomena, who hopes to become the first black plus size supermodel,  and Jada Sezer, who is the face of Plus Size Fashion Week. For the High Summer look book Debenhams worked with inclusivity campaigner and fashion industry commentator Caryn Franklin MBE. The aim is to further challenge perceived norms of the fashion industry showing that a broader range of body and beauty ideals is a good thing. 'Our customers are not the same shape or size so our latest look book celebrates this diversity. Debenhams' swimwear shots celebrate curves thanks to their size 18 bikini model . 'We would be delighted if others . followed our lead. Hopefully these shots will be a step, albeit a small . one, towards more people feeling more comfortable about their bodies,' said Ed Watson, Director of PR at Debenhams. 'To . showcase the range of sizes and labels at Debenhams this season we . chose models to inspire us with their own unique looks and . personalities. 'I . loved seeing the way that clothes emboldened each woman and man and I . loved being on a shoot where no two models were the same,' said Caryn . Franklin. No age limit: The campaign features 69-year-old Valerie Pain, whose modelling career began in the Sixties . Embracing all shapes and sizes: The look book features alternative model, Kelly, who was born without her left forearm and discovered when she won TV show 'Missing Next Top Model' Broad range: The aim is to further challenge perceived norms of the fashion industry showing that a broader range of body and beauty ideals is a good thing . 'As a commentator on the importance of seeing a broader range of body and beauty ideals in our media, I never underestimate the power of great clothes to bolster self-esteem, or the impact of imagery that celebrates difference,' she added. Minister for Women and Equalities Jo Swinson said: 'Once again Debenhams is showing that beauty comes in all forms – different skin colours, ages, body shapes and sizes. 'It was one of the first to introduce size 16 mannequins, and continues to send a clear message to the rest of the retail industry that many customers want to see more diverse and realistic images. Diverse: Petite Tess Montgomery, who's just 5ft tall features, as well as plus size model Jada Sezer, who at size 18 was the face of Plus Size Fashion Week . 'I have long been concerned that idealised, unrealistic media images play a significant part in lowering self-esteem and reducing women’s confidence and contribution – at school, at work, and in society. 'The government works with a range of industries, including retail and fashion, to promote more honest and varied images of women. 'The models in the look book are truly diverse, each with their own unique style and personality, and I hope they inspire others to feel good about their bodies.' Personalities: The models in the Look Book are truly diverse, each with their own unique style and personality . Debenhams scoured top model agencies in search of a group of professional models who go further to be representative of diversity, and to convey a message empowering every man and woman to feel able to wear the latest trends, but to make it right for them through style. The look book features alternative model, Kelly, who was born without her left forearm and discovered when she won TV show ‘Missing Next Top Model’. Paralympian amputee Stefanie Reid makes her modelling debut for Debenhams in the campaign and seasoned plus-size model Jada, size 18 and face of the recent Plus Size Fashion Week also features.

Japan's Defence Ministry has deployed Air Self-Defense Force's PAC-3s as a precaution against possible ballistic missile tests. Analysts see the latest warning from the North's Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee as an attempt to raise anxiety in Seoul and believe a direct attack on the capital as unlikely.

'If this situation continues, companies will face the risk of going bankrupt,' said Yoo Chang-geun, a vice president of the Corporate Association of Gaesong Industrial Complex. After an emergency meeting on Tuesday in Seoul, representatives of the companies said in a joint statement that they hope to send a delegation of small and medium-sized companies to North Korea in hopes of reopening the complex. The statement also appealed to South Korea to take a 'mature, embracing posture' and work out all available measures to help normalize Kaesong's operations. Meanwhile, a shipping container was seen outside the North Korean Embassy in Ealing, London yesterday, sparking rumours that the ambassador may soon be pulled out of the UK.","Thousands of North Koreans danced in honour of Kim Jony-Il on Tuesday .

And it appears that for women this really is the case. The fairer sex is more content, satisfied and fulfilled when they hit their fifth decade than at any other age - and even feel some 10 years younger than they actually are - according to a new study. So stars such as Nicole Kidman (45), Julia Roberts (45), Catherine Zeta-Jones (43), Selma Blair (40) and Geri Halliwell (40) will be feeling more vibrant and youthful now than they were in their early and mid-thirties. Actresses Nicole Kidman, left, and Julia Roberts, right, are both 45 years old . More than half of women over 40 (55 per . cent) also say they are more confident in their appearance than when . they were in their thirties. And a 86 per cent insist 40 is now the new . 30. With many saying they feel rejuvenated, 17 per cent put this down to having a better sex life than ever before, while 27 per cent say their dress sense is better than ever. Today's women in their forties are happier in a wider range of clothes than ever. The research by health food company Linwoods . Superfoods  found nearly two thirds - 59 per cent - still feel confident enough to wear a bikini. And 60 per cent insist their generation should still feel happy wearing figure-hugging tops or showing a glimpse of cleavage. The study by health food company quizzed 2,000 women aged 40 to 65 about their lives to . discover the effect of passing the milestone. It seems many insecurities are banished as women hit their forties, with an overwhelming 81 per cent saying they are happier in themselves than younger women. Actresses Selma Blair, left, 40, and Catherine Zeta-Jones, right, 43, should now feel more confident, secure and happy with themselves than they did a decade ago . This may be due to almost a third, 32 per cent, being more financially secure than ever, while 48 per cent said they were in a stable relationship. Actress Samantha Womack, 40, who played Ronnie Mitchell in Eastenders, said: 'The days when your 40th birthday represented the start of a slow descent into a quiet middle-age are long gone. 'Not only are women of 40 still full of energy, they are enjoying lives full of promise and possibilities. 'Women who are 40 and older are not slowing down, with many having babies, caring for children, supporting their own parents and working hard to maintain careers.' At 40 years old both Geri Halliwell, left, and ex-EastEnder Samantha Womack, right, should be feeling more like 30-year-old spring chickens . Joanne Hayden from Linwoods Superfoods said: 'These survey results reinforce that age really is just a number. 'Women of 40 and over are as full of life as ever and feeling fabulous has much more to do with how satisfied you are in life, from organised finances to a healthy diet, small changes can make a huge difference.' Caroline Harvey, 44, a teacher from Winchester, Hants, said: 'I definitely feel better about myself and my life since turning 40. 'I was more confident in my thirties than in my twenties and more comfortable in myself again now I'm in my forties. 'I feel like a stronger person and I care much less what others think. I'm more confident in my work, my relationship and motherhood.'","Nicole Kidman (45) and Julia Roberts (45) should now feel just 35 .

"By . Mark Duell and Louise Boyle . PUBLISHED: . 09:54 EST, 14 March 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 14:42 EST, 25 March 2013 . A vast British estate that had fallen into ruin after its American heir abandoned the land can finally be divided among relatives after 80 years of legal wrangling. The Hoblyn estate in Cornwall, with its enormous manor house set in 3,000 acres of lush English countryside worth $7.5million, has been inherited by two elderly sisters in California. However the women's cousin and next male heir - the only person who wanted to restore the estate to its former glory - has been left with a vastly reduced sum because of a change to the century-old will. The estate, with its 19th-century Fir Hill manor house, belonged to the Figg-Hoblyn family who first moved to the property in 1856. Inheritance: American heir John Paget Figg-Hoblyn (left) never accepted his right to the English estate but this blocked the land being claimed by his cousin, John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn (right), a retired farmer from Missouri . After decades of being handed down to ancestors, Hoblyn Estate had been unclaimed for 40 years. The rightful heir John Paget Figg-Hoblyn lived for a short time on the land in Cornwall in the 1960s but later returned to California because the legal issue of entailment had not been settled. John Paget never indicated to the British High Court that he wanted to accept Hoblyn Estate after the death of his father Francis in 1965. It meant the estate, close to the village of Colan, was prevented from passing to the second-in-line, his cousin and only male heir, John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn. The century-old will had a clause which said the estate must pass to the next male heir which was Mr Westropp. The retired farmer and father-of-four from Missouri said that  wanted to live and work on the family estate, restoring it to its former glory and becoming a pillar of the community. The British courts recognized Mr Westropp as a legitimate heir. Worth millions: John Paget Figg-Hoblyn, pictured as a younger man. The Californian stood to inherit a vast English estate but ignored it and died impoverished in his eighties . However because of the legal impasse, Hoblyn Estate lay empty. Over the years, the mansion fell into disrepair after lying empty and unloved while the land and gardens became overgrown. Parts of the estate were sold off to pay death duties and administration costs. The estate, which has shrunk to 1,000 acres, is still valued at £5million. John Paget had a PhD in marine biology from the prestigious Stanford University. He worked as a marine biologist and held a post at San Francisco State University in California. He also served in the military during World War Two. Mr Paget opted for a low-key existence with his sister Peggy in California, traveling around in an old RV. The brother and sister lived an organic lifestyle and were involved in farmer's markets in California. At one point, there were claims that the pair had been evicted from a trailer park in Santa Barbara, where they were living in two trucks after failing to pay $200 rent. Cut out: John Westropp Figg-Hoblyn, pictured with his wife, visits the estate which he was due to inherit as the only male heir before changes to the will cut him out . Mr Paget died on June 12, 2011 at the age of 85 after being placed in a nursing home. His death allowed the destiny of the estate to be decided by a judge at the Court of Protection in London. The century-old will was rewritten as if John Paget were in his right mind to settle the century-long impasse. An original clause which said the estate would pass to a male heir was cut out and the sale proceeds of the . estate split between John Paget's next-of-kin, his elderly sisters in . California. His sister Margaret, who is believed to . be in a nursing home, and Anne, are to share the million-dollar . inheritance from the sale of Hoblyn Estate after legal and doctors . bills are paid. Falling down: This derelict remains of the 19th century Fir Hill manor house on the Hoblyn estate in Cornwall . The Hoblyn estate near Newquay in Cornwall, was once an impressive country pile of 3,000 acres, a manor house, farms, houses and woods. The estate sits close to Colan, an idyllic but sleepy country parish. The Hoblyn family first moved into Fir Hill House in 1856. Then it was alive with the hustle and bustle of servants, horse-drawn carriages and the local gentry. After decades of abandonment, it is now little more than a tumbled-down ruin, encased in ivy and inhabited by rooks. They are expected to receive £1.3million (close to $2million) each. Only £130,000 (around $200,000) will go to the closest surviving male heir, John Westropp, their cousin. It was thought John Paget, who is thought to have visited the property in the 1960s, had disputed paying death duties in England and would not sign legal documents. Britain's Official Solicitor, who deals with such property matters, tried in vain to contact John Paget about his vast inheritance 30 years ago. In 1985, the Official Solicitor wrote: . ‘John Paget Figg-Hoblyn, by the stroke of a pen and by meeting some . other details, can take over the property. 'Yet I do not know his . address.’ Impressive building: This archive photo from the 1930s shows Fir Hill manor in all its pride on the Hoblyn estate . The history of Hoblyn Estate has long been marked with scandal and family tragedy. In 1856, William Paget Hoblyn was the first to move into Fir Hill Manor. He lived there in grandeur with his wife, son and four daughters. Derek Luscombe, Colan Parish Council . However their idyllic life came to be tainted by a bitter legal battle surrounding William Paget Hoblyn's will. The estate, according to legal documents drawn up by a previous owner, was intended to pass to the eldest male heir. However William Paget Hoblyn also wanted his daughters to share in the property. However Hoblyn's eldest son Ernest, a known heavy drinker, challenged the legal changes while his father was still alive. Ernest lost the battle against his sisters soon after his father died and shortly before his own early death. The Cornish estate was then thrown into turmoil. With only four Hoblyn daughters left - all spinsters and with no male heir - no one could inherit the house and lands. Two remained spinsters and one married but did not have children. And the fourth sister scandalized local society with her love life. Crumbling: This picture shows the stable block at Fir Hill manor on the estate in Cornwall . When she was 20, she ran off to South Africa with coachman John Jones who was in his thirties and married with four sons. Rosalind soon regretted her actions. Ancestor: Squire William Paget Hoblyn is pictured with three of his children - Ernest, Wilhelmin and Rosalind - in the 1860s. He moved into Fir Hill in 1856 . The Western Morning News reported in April 1882: ‘The unfortunate girl’s story was a pitiful one. 'She wished herself back home within 24 hours of leaving, and left her swain distinguishing himself as a waiter at an hotel.’ Her parents were on the dockside to greet her on her return to Plymouth, Devon. She found a more suitable partner in naval officer Thomas Richard Figg, a tea broker's son, and they married in March 1884. The couple moved to British Columbia, Canada and then to California, and their four children took the surname Figg-Hoblyn. Rosalind’s eldest son Francis Figg-Hoblyn, a gold miner in California, was due to take over the estate on the deaths of his mother and Cornish aunts. In 1947, he visited the estate and invited the tenant farmers to a meeting at Colan to announce his intention of restoring the estate to its former glory. However Francis was annoyed that his elderly aunts had let the estate become run down. He would not sign a document saying that he was satisfied the estate and would take it on. He returned to California and died in 1965. The estate then passed to his eldest son John Paget where the legal wranglings continued until this year. Seen now: John Paget's sisters Margaret, who is now thought to be in care, and Anne, are to share the £5million estate, once all the land and properties are sold and the legal, doctors' and rest home bills paid . Derek Luscombe, vice-chairman of Colan Parish Council said recently that he was delighted the long-running will dispute was finally settled. He said it gave a chance for the estate to be rejuvenated. Mr Luscombe said . that just before Christmas, Charlie Hoblyn, a distant cousin of John . Paget, addressed Colan Parish Council with plans to open a new campsite . on part of the estate he had just bought. That plan will be subject to . planning approval from Cornwall Council. ‘Most people have forgotten the estate is there because the dispute went on so long,' Mr Luscombe added. But I think locals will be pleased to know it's finally been settled.’","Hoblyn estate has a manor house set in 3,000 acres of Cornish farmland .

Only the night before one, who preferred to remain anonymous, had spoken to Mr Berry as he walked the streets of Clayton and said he seemed in 'good spirits'. But the following afternoon officers from West Yorkshire Police arrived at Mr Berry's £250,000 red-brick home, where he lived with his wife Janette, 40, and their three girls,  to carry out a search for illegal drugs. The Local Neighbourhood Policing Team officers were all unarmed. It is believed they were confronted by Mr Berry at the top of the stairs, who had his hands behind his back. Officers pursued him to the first floor, and, when he was asked to show his hands, he refused and officers tried to restrain him.

A disappointed cinema-goer has won a refund after complaining that the 2012 Tom Cruise thriller Jack Reacher did not include an explosion featured in its trailer. The New Zealand film buff, named only as J Congdon, complained to the country's Advertising Standards Authority that the missing explosion was 'the defining part of the ad'. The scene, which features in the trailer for less than a second, shows a huge detonation which dramatically brings down an entire cliff face. Misleading advertising: A New Zealand film fan won a refund from Paramount Pictures after noticing that a scene in the trailer for the Tom Cruise film Jack Reacher (pictured) did not appear in the final edit . Paramount Pictures, the film company behind Jack Reacher, admitted the error and agreed to refund the cost of Mr Congdon's ticket. It said the trailer for the action thriller was released before its final edit had been completed and, as a result, the 'split-second' scene used to promote the film was cut before it made it to the cinema. But the studio nevertheless defended the trailer, which showed at least two further scenes not featured in the film's final cut. Mr Congdon made his complaint after seeing the advert on television earlier this year, and noticing that the explosion in the trailer did not appear in the film's final edit when he went to see it in the cinema. He told the New Zealand ASA that the 'explosion where the whole cliff comes down' was 'the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie... aside from having Tom Cruise in it.' Paramount said it was a 'usual and . longstanding practice in the film industry' that cinema trailers and . television advertisements be produced weeks or months before editing was . complete, the New Zealand Herald reported. 'Thus, . despite our best intentions, it is always possible that certain scenes . appearing in an advertisement or trailer may not appear in the final . version of a film,' the company told the ASA. It . added: 'The explosion in question was a single split-second element . omitted from a 130-minute long action film and [we] believe that, taken . as a whole, the impression created by the advertisement was a true and . fair reflection of the film which could not reasonably be considered . misleading or deceptive to customers.' Deleted scene: The missing explosion the fan called 'the defining part of the ad that made me really want to go see the movie' Although based on a series of best-selling novels, Jack Reacher had modest worldwide receipts of $212million, with the casting of Tom Cruise in the title role regarded a controversial choice. A signature feature of the novel's lead character is that he is unusually tall, while Cruise is only 5ft 6in. MailOnline contacted Paramount to find out why the explosion did not make the final cut, but as yet we have received no response.","The scene in question appears for less than a second in the trailer .

Ballet prodigy Sergei Polunin has turned up in Moscow after vanishing just days before his new show was set for its UK premiere. There were fears after the 23-year-old Ukrainian, dubbed the bad boy of ballet, stopped showing up for rehearsals for the UK premiere of Midnight Express a week before the show was to start. The show's director, Peter Schaufuss, had expressed concern for the star, who is well known for his party lifestyle. Sergei Polunin dances with Tamara Rojo at the Royal Ballet in February: The wildchild ballet star has turned up in Moscow after last week fleeing rehearsals for Midnight Express, his latest London show . It was the second vanishing act by Polunin, who dramatically quit Britain's Royal Ballet in January last year just a week before he was due to dance in The Dream. After the Ukrainian dancer failed to show up for rehearsals last week his hotel room was searched but he had vanished. It was even feared he might have been involved in an accident. But a spokesman for the Stanislavsky and Nemirovich-Danchenko Theatre, where Polunin now dances, said yesterday that the star was fine and back in Moscow. The reason for his sudden departure from remains unknown, but there have been claims that he left because he didn't like Mr Schaufuss's production of Midnight Express. The heavily tattooed Polunin is a . rising star in the ballet world, joining the Royal Ballet at the age of . 13 and at 21, becoming the youngest dancer to be made a principal. After . quitting the Royal Ballet last year, he told reporters that he found . rehearsing ""very boring"" and wanted to give up ballet by the age of 26 . as it was so gruelling. But . he returned to the stage quickly, performing with Moscow's Stanislavsky . Ballet and making guest appearances with the Royal Ballet. Polunin and Rojo in another scene from the same production: After the Ukrainian dancer failed to show up for rehearsals last week his hotel room was searched but he had vanished, raising fears he may have been hurt . His lead role in Midnight Express, which had its preview performance last night at the London Coliseum, was taken by understudy Johan Christensen, who had been in rehearsals with Polunin. The ballet, that Schaufuss first choreographed in 2000, is based on the 1977 memoir by Billy Hayes about being jailed in Turkey for drug smuggling. The book was also made into a film which won a Best Writing Academy Award for Oliver Stone.","Sergei Polunin stopped going to rehearsals for Midnight Express last week .

A mother of three lay dead beneath six feet of rubbish for 19 months before anyone noticed she was there, an inquest has heard. The skeletal remains of Julie Ann Watson, 37, were found curled in a foetal position beneath a pile of bin bags to the rear of a derelict house, yards from where she lived in South Belfast. Her body was so badly decomposed no cause of death could be determined and authorities had to resort to calling in an archaeologist to help with post-mortem examinations. 'A desperately sad and shocking case': Coroner . Jim Kitson, sitting at Belfast Coroner's Court, could not determine the . cause of Julie Ann Watson's death because her remains were so badly decayed . 'This is a desperately sad and tragic case,' said Belfast Coroner Jim Kitson. 'It is also in some ways shocking that the body of a young woman of some 37 years of age can lie undiscovered for a period of 19 months.' Ms Watson was last seen alive in August 2009 and her final bank activity was a month later, police said. The heavy-drinking mother may have died from sniffing solvents after an aerosol can was found beside her, a pathologist said, but he was unable to make a definitive finding because the body was so badly decayed. The coroner could not determine a cause of death. 'It appears quite clear that Julie's life was out of control and sadly it appears Julie was in the grips of some sort of alcoholism or addiction,' Mr Kitson said. Her brother William Watson had not seen her since 2006 and a close friend said she had become afraid to leave her home. Nicola Johnston recalled her drinking from morning to night, litre after litre of cider. 'She was sitting crying like a baby,' Ms Johnston added. Ms Watson was only found after an elderly neighbour complained about the growing piles of rubbish at the property on Donegall Avenue, which the inquest heard was a common spot for fly-tipping. Construction workers found the dead woman in April 2011, the Irish Independent reported . Her body was covered in several old fractures from an accident or assault, pathologist Dr Alistair Bentley said, including a bone in her neck broken by pressure. None of these injuries caused her death and had happened a considerable time beforehand, the expert added. An archaeology expert had to be brought in to identify the different fractures, which may have been caused by falls linked to excessive drinking. Miss Watson had a difficult start to life and was put into foster care after her parents split, her brother said. She later went through a divorce, descending into a spiral of depression and alcoholism, the inquest heard. 'She thought the whole world was against her,' Mr Watson recalled. After her divorce she 'dropped off the radar', the coroner said. She stayed with friends or in hostels but later moved into a property at Kitchener Street, close to where her body was found, with a friend called Joseph Blair. He told police she tended to leave for weeks at a time and he did not consider them to be in a relationship. After she disappeared in August 2009 he assumed she was living somewhere else. He was interviewed by police but a detective told the inquest his account was plausible and there were no signs of a crime having been committed. Dr Bentley said: 'Within the limits imposed by the degree of decomposition there was nothing that I found to suggest that she had been the victim of a homicide.' Her bones were found curled in a foetal position with an aerosol and plastic bag close. A pathologist said she may have been inhaling the gases of the spray, which can interfere with the heart beat, but it was not possible to analyse for the toxic substances. The coroner said it was clear she was not the victim of a murder. 'Her death will remain undetermined due to advanced decomposition,' he added. Sorry we are unable to accept comments for legal reasons.","Julie Ann Watson's body was so decomposed no cause of death could be determined .

NICE is considering recommending that patients and staff are banned from smoking in hospital grounds . Staff, patients and relatives should all be banned from smoking in the grounds of hospitals, according to new guidance from the NHS  watchdog. The ‘no concessions’ policy on smoking would see the removal of . smoking shelters from hospital grounds. Staff should also be disciplined if . they smoke at work or at any other time when they . could be identified as an NHS employee, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence guidance says. The organisation is considering the draft recommendations in an attempt to encourage hospital bosses to put an end to the sight of patients in hospital gowns smoking outside medical centres. The guidance, which will not be compulsory, also suggests that patients who wish to smoke should be given nicotine . patches and gum and informed in writing that smoking at the hospital is banned. Relatives of patients wishing to smoke they should be sold nicotine replacement in hospital shops to discourage them. Until now NICE recommended that the NHS should ‘seek to promote not smoking as the norm’. NICE is also encouraging hospitals to provide patients with information on the dangers of smoking. This will include advising them not to smoke near other patients, pregnant women, women with children or while at home or in a car. Hospitals will also be told to offer people who want to stop smoking a referral to a stop smoking adviser. Mike Kelly, director of the NICE Centre for Public Health, said: ‘The benefits of stopping smoking are well known, and people are already required by law not to smoke inside enclosed or mostly enclosed buildings. ‘This draft guidance sets out . proposals on supporting people in a hospital environment not to smoke, . as well as supporting the smoke-free policies in hospitals. The watchdog also says that hospitals should deal with patients who wish to smoke by giving them nicotine patches and gum . ‘Secondary care providers have a responsibility to protect the health of people who use or work in their services. ‘The draft recommendations propose that this duty of care should also cover providing advice on how to improve health, including stop smoking interventions.’ The draft proposals will now be the subject of a two month consultation. Treating smoking-related illnesses is estimated to cost the NHS £2.7 billion each year. Smoking is the main cause of preventable illness and premature death in England. A wide range of diseases and conditions are caused by smoking, including cancers, respiratory diseases, heart and other circulatory diseases.","NHS should adopt a 'no concessions' policy on smoking, according to draft guidance from NICE .

An American photographer has taken a series of close up photographs of bullet holes which look uncannily like the most beautiful galaxies. Deborah Bay, from Houston, Texas, created her collection, The Big Bang, by getting firearms experts at Houston Community College to fire bullets at Plexiglas – a lightweight, shatter-proof alternative to glass. An American photographer has taken a series of close up photographs of bullet holes which resemble the Milky Way . She then used macro-photography to capture images of the bullets lodged in the Plexiglas as a way of looking at the tension between the destructive nature of weapons and the fragile beauty of the damage they create. The result was a collection of images which she says show ‘the jewel-like beauty and the inherent destructiveness of the fragmented projectiles’. ‘When you think about the impact of the bullet hitting an animal or a person or whatever it’s intended to hit there is just the push and pull in the pictures of the beauty versus the horror,’ Ms Bay told Wired. To get the close-up shots, the photographer sometimes had to combine multiple images of the same bullet hole in order to get enough depth of field. The colours visible in the images come from minerals in the gunpowder, and from coloured lights and gels Ms Bay uses in her studio. Ms Bay, who is fascinated with weapons and their inescapable role in American culture, says on her website: ‘I began thinking about The Big Bang after seeing a sales display of bullet-proof Plexiglas with projectiles embedded in it.

A woman who was nearly killed in a horrific car crash has made a miraculous recovery to become a champion triathlete. Less than a year ago, Jackie Stretton was fighting for her life after she was involved in a pile-up caused by thieves on the run from police. She was put into a drug-induced coma after suffering a broken back, broken leg and bleeding on the brain. The 26-year-old was warned she would never compete again but she has stunned doctors with her enthusiastic return to sport. Jackie Stretton suffered a broken back, broken leg and head injury in a car crash which was caused by car thieves involved in a police chase . Ms Stretton said: ‘Doctors told me I should never race again because of knee ligament damage sustained in the crash but I didn't want to let two people driving like idiots ruin my life. ‘I am the kind of person who, as soon as someone tells me I can't do something, I am determined that I will do it. ‘I proved a point to myself, I would hope that it shows other people that sometimes really bad things happen but it should never change your aims, ambitions and dreams.’ Ms Stretton, of Chelmsford, Essex, who accepts that doctors would not encourage her involvement in triathlons, admitted the past year had been an emotional rollercoaster. She said: ‘I can't believe it has been a year - I spent six months lying on a sofa and six months trying to live the life I missed out on, I suppose. ‘When I returned for my first triathlon, my only aim was to compete so when I won, it was an amazing feeling. ‘It made all the hard work and determination worth it.’ Ms Stretton was nearly killed when she became the innocent victim of a high-speed police chase which had started in Suffolk. Before the crash, she took part in triathlons and other adventure races. She was told she wouldn't be able to compete again as a result of her injuries . After the crash, Ms Stretton set herself the goal of returning to competitive sport before her 26th birthday - an aim which she achieved with just days to spare. She is pictured running just before the crash . Tyrell O'Donnell, 20, from Torquay, Devon and Jason Young, 21, from Axminster, Devon, lost control of their Fiat Stilo on the A414 in Danbury, Essex, after the 100mph pursuit. The chase had crossed two counties before the pair's vehicle collided with a blue Beetle which then smashed into Ms Stretton’s tiny hatchback sending her head-on into a pursuing police car. However, she was determined to return to competition before her 26th birthday - and she managed the feat with two days to spare. She took part in a ‘Tri-Adventure’ which saw her endure two hours of running, cycling and orienteering in Surrey. Recovering: Ms Stretton's tiny hatchback car was sent head-on into a police car during the car chase. She was left fighting for her life . She went on to win the first triathlon she took part in after returning to competitive sport . Her next challenge is competing in a gruelling ironman event in Scotland in June to raise funds for the Essex Air Ambulance who airlifted her to hospital following the accident. The gruelling City to Summit event involves a 2.4-mile swim in Edinburgh, a 112-mile bike ride and then 26.2-mile off-road marathon to the summit of Ben Nevis. She said: ‘I booked myself on to that race when I was lying in a back brace on my sofa. ‘It was my ambition - I knew I was going to get better if I kept my focus on doing that race - I had something to strive for. ‘To have come through something so horrific just showed me that I am quite strong and capable of a lot, more than I thought I was.’ As a result of her injuries, for months Ms Stretton could only stand with the help of a back brace . Judge Rodger Hayward-Smith QC made headlines in August last year as he bemoaned sentencing guidelines which only allowed him to sentence the pair to 18 months and 16 months imprisonment, respectively, for aggravated vehicle taking. He stunned onlookers at Chelmsford Crown Court saying: ‘You will get out of prison and will get your life back but Jackie Stretton will never get over this, physically or mentally. ‘It is absurd - if I just pass sentence and allow credit for your guilty pleas, because I have to - it will not be enough. ‘It is awful. I am stuck with it because of what the law says and I can't abide it.’ However, Ms Stretton has not let the justice system soften her resolve despite the pair being released earlier this year after serving just half of their sentence. The Sainsbury’s product manager said: ‘That's the criminal justice system for you.' Having regained her fitness, she now plans to raise money for the Essex Air Ambulance which airlifted her to hospital after the crash . She admitted crying every day following the accident after being told she may never compete in competitive sport again. At first she could not feed herself and could stand up for less than a minute at a time without the help of a back brace. But now she has moved into her own flat and she continues to rebuild her life. She said: ‘The last 12 months has been a real emotional journey. My lowest point was when my leg cast came off and I couldn't bend my knee at all. ‘There were a lot of points where I thought I would be like this forever. It was horrendous but I just kept pushing myself a little further every day. ‘I have been pretty much working, training at the gym and racing. ‘They [the thieves] have got over it, but I want to show them that what they did could not destroy my life. ‘It . was really upsetting to see that they were both released, but fingers . crossed they have both learned their lesson and they won't hurt anyone . else. ‘I wouldn't wish what happened to me on my worst enemy.’","Jackie Stretton was injured in a crash caused by thieves in a police chase .

Many major hospitals have missed their national accident and emergency target every week for the last six months, it has been claimed. Andy Burnham, the Shadow Health Secretary, said that major A&E units across England have failed to meet the target of seeing 95 per cent of patients within four hours. This has been the case every week since late September. His claims come after one A&E department in Norfolk was this week forced to erect an emergency tent outside because it was so overcrowded. Mr Burnham said new data from NHS England shows the 95 per cent target has been missed across the NHS, with less than 70 per cent of patients being seen within four hours at some trusts. He said that compared to last year, 107,000 more patients have had to wait longer than four hours. ‘Standards of care are deteriorating in many parts of the country as the NHS is dragged down by David Cameron's toxic mix of cuts and re-organisation,’ said Mr Burnham. ‘England's A&E departments are suffering their worst winter for a decade, with thousands more people waiting longer to be seen across the country. ‘The NHS has failed to hit the target almost the entire time Jeremy Hunt has been Health Secretary. He urgently needs to get a grip and focus on what matters. ‘Almost 5,000 nursing jobs have been lost since David Cameron entered Downing Street. Ministers must develop a plan to bring all A&Es in England back up to national standards.’ A Department of Health spokeswoman said: ‘The NHS is seeing an extra one million patients in A&E compared to two years ago and despite the additional workload it is coping well. ‘Patients shouldn't face excessive waits for treatment, which is why we provided £330 million to help the NHS cope with the extra pressure the cold weather brings. ‘The Government is meeting its promise to deliver a real terms increase in health spending and there are now 7,000 more professionally qualified clinical staff in the NHS since 2010. In contrast, the number of admin staff has fallen by over 18,000, and the money saved put back into frontline patient care.’ On Monday, Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital's A&E department became so overcrowded that it was forced to erect an emergency treatment tent . Mr Burnham’s comments come just after . it emerged that patients in Norfolk faced the prospect of being treated . in a tent on Monday after an A&E department became overcrowded. A treatment tent, usually reserved for use during major emergencies, was erected outside Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital as a precaution but it was not needed to treat patients. One ambulance crewman said: 'We are so fed-up with getting slated and being made to look as if the ambulance service is to blame for the delays - but it's not us, it's A&E. 'They want to get out and save lives. That's all they want to do and they are getting caught up in a political row. 'The tent is usually used at plane crashes and big events, such as the Lord Mayor's parade. To put it up outside the A&E is unheard of.' Another ambulance worker, who also asked to remain anonymous, said: 'It's a mini-hospital in a tent.' 'It will usually have in it treatment bays, drugs, oxygen, the same stuff on board an ambulance but inside a tent - which is a lot colder.' Hospital chief executive Anna Dugdale said: 'The demand on emergency services over the bank holiday weekend had been exceptionally high and the ambulance tent was erected for a short period as a precautionary measure.'","Shadow Health Secretary Andy Burnham claims some A&Es are only seeing 70% patients within four hours .

He has waxed lyrical since her death, calling Baroness Thatcher ‘a model’ and ‘the greatest statesman of the 20th century.’ But despite his overtures, Silvio Berlusconi has still not made final cut for her very last hurrah. The former Italian premier was intent on appearing at the funeral with world leaders next week, and has been lobbying hard behind the scenes for the invitation. There were ‘numerous and insistent’ phone calls to the Italian embassy in London, according to the Italian newspaper Il Fatto Quotidiano. No invite: Former Italian premier Silvio Berlusconi, left, had been intent on attending Baroness Thatcher's funeral but has not been invited . He even dispatched an envoy, his right-hand man Gianni Letta, to petition the embassy on his behalf. But to no avail. Acting prime minister Mario Monti, a technocrat who is unlikely to cause embarrassment, is to be Italy’s representative. Downing Street confirmed that each country was only allocated one diplomatic invitation. ‘It is up to the individual countries to decide who they want to send,’ a spokesman said. Guest: Prime Minister Mario Monti will be Italy's representative at Baroness Thatcher's funeral . ‘Of course there may be other invitations to Italians but they are personal, chosen by the family.’ The snub is likely to have caused great offence to the billionaire politician, a huge fan of Baroness Thatcher’s. On Monday he said he had been ‘honoured by her friendship and esteem.’ In fact Baroness Thatcher was one of Berlusconi’s staunch defenders. As corruption charges mounted against him she had insisted that he was the victim of ‘character assassination’. In government we had ‘very similar goals’, she said. Ever coarse, Berlusconi had responded by saying - in Neapolitan slang - that the former Conservative leader was ‘a hot piece of ass’. Berlusconi is report to have kept a picture of Baroness Thatcher on his desk and is said to have once missed his daughter's birthday party to have dinner with her. But in 2008, he reportedly snubbed the Iron Lady when he was supposed to be the guest of honour at a dinner thrown in Italy for the Baroness, but failed to turn up.

The 75-year-old actress will star in Lee Daniels' forthcoming film, The Butler, but her casting has created a backlash from veterans because of her stance on the Vietnam War. They have been angered by Fonda's inclusion in the film because of her involvement in the protest against the war, where she called Americans 'war criminals'. A movement to boycott the . film, which will be shown in U.S. cinemas this October, is gaining momentum. Larry Reyes, a Navy veteran, has started a . Facebook campaign called 'Boycott Hanoi Jane Playing Nancy Reagan' and . described her casting as a 'slap in the face'. But Fonda, a seven-time Oscar nominee, showed no signs of backing down and told her critics to 'get a life.' In a statement to The Hollywood . Reporter, she said: 'If it creates hoopla, it will cause more people to . see the movie… I figured it would tweak the right. Who cares?' Mr Reyes said that while Fonda had 'every right' to protest the Vietnam War, she 'bordered on treason' when she went to Hanoi, Vietnam, called Americans 'war criminals,' and was photographed seated on an anti-aircraft battery. He told FOX411’s Pop Tarts column: 'Growing up in a military family I heard my father and uncles talk about what Jane did, so from an early age I knew about her history with the war and how upset veterans were about it. 'Then when I heard she was going to play such a well-liked and highly respected president’s wife, it got to me. Jane Fonda will play Nancy Reagan, who was married to President Ronald Reagan, died in June 2004. The actress says the former First Lady is 'happy' she was awarded the role . 'They (the filmmakers) knew by picking . Jane for the part they were going to stir up some stuff. I’m not a . conservative or a liberal, I’m an American. And that was a slap in the . face. 'It’s my right to protest this film, and if I can stop a few people from seeing it, I will be happy.' Yet according to Fonda, Mrs Reagan is 'happy' she was awarded the role. The Monster-in-Law star said she sent the former First Lady some questions to make sure she portrays her accurately, which she answered. She said the First Lady’s response to her being cast came as a surprise, 'because back when she was feisty she wasn't nice to me. We all mellow. We all mellow.' The Butler is based on the story of an African-American man (played by Forest Whitaker) who served as a butler to eight presidents in the White House over 30 years and touches upon the dramatic changes in American society including the civil rights movement and Vietnam.

Malawi President Joyce Banda has denied calling Madonna a 'bully' amid claims that she had not approved a statement from her office attacking the singer. The president is reportedly furious over the statement which accused the star of blackmail, demanding behaviour and bullying state officials on a recent visit to the country. According to the BBC, the head of Malawi's NGO board, said that President Banda 'did not approve' or know about the statement which came from her office on Wednesday. Scroll down for video . War of words: Malawi president Joyce Banda, left,  has denied calling singer Madonna, pictured right on her recent visit to the African country, a bully . Philanthropist: Madonna plays with Malawian children at Mkoko Primary School in the region of Kasungu, central Malawi earlier this month . The latest development in a extraordinary war of words which erupted following the star's visit to new primary schools in the country follows a statement released by the singer's charity yesterday which accused President Banda of 'releasing lies' The statement from President Banda's office had claimed that the 54-year-old Material Girl singer, who adopted two of her four children from Malawi, has failed to keep her promise to spend money improving infrastructure in the impoverished nation. It accused her of wanting the government to ‘roll out the red carpet’, adding: ‘If Madonna believes she deserved to be treated differently . . . it is worth making her aware that Malawi has hosted many international stars, including Chuck Norris, Bono, David James, Rio Ferdinand and Gary Neville, who have never demanded state attention or decorum despite their equally dazzling stature. The statement added that Madonna hadn't been invited to the African country and accused her of exagerrating her contribution to the state. Return: American pop star Madonna sits with the two children she adopted in Malawi, David Banda and Mercy James, in a classroom of the Mkoko Primary School in the area of Santhe in Kasungu district . Promotion: Madonna uses her star power to highlight the struggle for children in Malawi . It said: 'Among the many things that Madonna needs to learn as a matter of urgency is the decency of telling the truth. 'For her to tell the whole world that she is building schools in Malawi when she has actually only contributed to the construction of classrooms is not compatible with the manners of someone who thinks she deserves to be revered with state grandeur. Strong words: President Banda had apparently claimed that Madonna demanded special treatment on her visit to the country . 'The difference between a school and a classroom should be the most obvious thing for a person demanding state courtesy to decipher.' 'In the feeling of Madonna, the Malawi Government and its leadership should have rolled out a red carpet and blasted the 21-gun salute in her honour because she believes that as a musician, the whiff of whose repute flies across international boundaries, she automatically is candidate for VIP treatment,' the statement read. 'Granted, Madonna has adopted two children from Malawi. According to the record, this gesture was humanitarian and of her accord. 'It, therefore, comes across as strange and depressing that for a humanitarian act, prompted only by her, Madonna wants Malawi to be forever chained to the obligation of gratitude. 'Kindness, as far as its ordinary meaning is concerned, is free and anonymous. 'If it can't be free and silent, it is not kindness; it is something else. Blackmail is the closest it becomes.' A 'saddened' Madonna had hit back yesterday with a strongly worded statement which accused President Banda of 'lies'. She pledged to continue her work with the country. She said: 'I'm saddened that Malawi president Joyce Banda has chosen to release lies about what we've accomplished, my intentions, how I personally conducted myself while visiting Malawi and other untruths. 'I did not ever ask or demand special treatment at the airport or elsewhere during my visit. 'I will not be distracted or discouraged by other people's political agendas. 'I made a promise to the children of Malawi and I'm keeping that promise.' Madonna has been a frequent visitor to Malawi in recent years after pledging to donate millions to set up schools, orphanges and medical centres in the impoverished state. She adopted her son David in 2006 and daughter Mercy James in 2009 from Malawi.

He was initially cared for by Hollywood trainer Bob Dunn. But Bubbles was moved again to the sanctuary, which cares for more than 40 other chimpanzees and orangutans, in 2005 and has remained there since. None of Michael's children are said to have visited the animal. A source at the sanctuary told The Sun: 'It is a world away from the life he once knew, but Bubbles seems all the happier for it.

But as the shop assistant tried to calm her daughter down, the bus driver turned round and swore at them and ordered them to get off. Shock: Paryss Walter, 22, said she is now scared of getting on buses after she was ordered off because her daughter Lillie was crying . The mother protested and other passengers on the bus in Walton, Suffolk, said they did not have a problem with the young girl. However, Paryss claimed the driver became more aggressive so she got off the bus with her daughter in the dark - even though others said she was within her rights to stay on. She made an official complaint and the worker has now been ordered to go on a customer service re-training course. But the company was unable to tell the . aggrieved mother whether there was any other disciplinary action taken . because of employee confidentiality. Bus trouble: Paryss, 22, said her daughter was having a tantrum on the bus - but she was shocked to be ordered off . Paryss was left in tears following the incident and she said she is now frightened of getting back on the bus. 'The driver stopped the bus and turned round and said ""that's it - I have got a headache - I have had enough. Get off my f****** bus"". 'He was raging and it was totally disproportionate to what was happening - I was so shocked and I could not believe it. I was going to get off but it was the other passengers who told me not to be silly, that I had nothing to be ashamed of.' The mother said her daughter had been having a tantrum but said the driver's response was 'totally over the top'. She added: 'Lillie is two years old and like many children of her age she does sometimes cry and get upset and can scream. 'I told the driver that I was within my rights to stay on the bus, but then he started to make his way towards me, so I left at that point as I was starting to worry about what he would do to me and my daughter. 'When I got off I realised I was shaking in fear and then I burst into tears. It was dark outside and I did not want to walk home as it was a good 10 minutes from where I live and it is not well lit and of course I had Lillie with me. 'It was freezing cold, it was dark and I was scared because it was pitch black - I could not believe what was happening to us.' Paryss, who had been to visit her mother, suffers from  panic attacks and has a weak heart which she had surgery on when she was a child. The mother was planning to walk home but went into a coffee shop to steady her nerves after the incident at about 5.50pm. A kindly customer could see that she was so upset that he drove her and Lillie the remainder of their journey home. First Bus said to her in a letter following the incident on February 21 that they had taken action against the driver. Proud mother: Paryss was returning from visiting her own mother when she was ordered off the bus in Walton, Suffolk .

A spokesman for the National Trust . said: 'Throughout the winter, water and ice has been permeating through . the chalk so we've seen consistent but small falls of rock. Changing face: Walkers could soon face being deprived of some of the country's most beautiful views after the prolonged cold and wet winter has led to a series of devastating landslides . Closure: Since last April heavy rain has caused several landslides on large sections of the Jurassic Coast in Dorset . Spectacular views: Walkers on the South West Cliff path. With stunning views from a great height the walk is a popular option for walkers . 'The south coast is an evolving landscape and is prone to cliff erosion but the wet weather has exacerbated the falling of the chalk. 'The bad weather affects it, particularly this year.' While cliff erosion is typically caused . by the sudden change between cold and warm weather, ice in the rock can . also prove harmful. When the water deposited by rain or snow freezes it expands, causing cracks and weaknesses to form in the chalk. Experts believe the cliffs on the southern coast will move up to 200 yards away from France this century but a series of freezing winters could accelerate the process. Jo Rawlings from the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, said: 'The recent wet weather has seen sections of our coast become very vulnerable to movement. We're now warning the public that some coastal paths in particular are likely to be unstable. 'We advise people to take care when walking on top of cliffs and also give a wide berth to the base of cliffs when walking below on the shoreline.' Crack: Earlier this year a 150ft (45m) long, 6ft (1.8m) deep crack appeared on cliffs near Bowleaze Cove, Weymouth . Safety: Walkers have been warned about a large crack which has appeared near a stretch of the Dorset coast path .","Since last April heavy rain has caused .

Police are looking for the mother gave birth to her daughter and then left her newborn wrapped in a blanket lying on a park bench. The infant, who has been named Charlotte after the police woman who took her to hospital, was found in Hailesland Park in Edinburgh yesterday. Police have urged the mother, who was not with the baby, to seek medical attention immediately as she she is believed to have given birth just 24 hours beforehand. The newborn, named Charlotte after the police officer who accompanied her to hospital, was discovered by a passer-by in Hailesland Park in Wester Hailes, Edinburgh . Police have urged the mother, who was not with the baby (seen here with her nurse), to seek medical attention immediately as she she is believed to have given birth just 24 hours beforehand . The girl was discovered lying peacefully on a bench behind Kilncroft Stair at around 12.55pm by Lawrence Liddell. Mr Liddell, 59, said today: 'We really couldn't believe it when we found the baby. 'It was a really tiny newborn wrapped up in a blanket - she wasn't wearing anything underneath. 'I had met my friend in the hallway of the flats and we started walking along together because we were both heading out to visit our mothers. 'As we were walking along we saw the baby. Lawrence Riddell discovered the tiny infant wrapped in a blanket . 'She wasn't crying and she didn't appear to be in any kind of distress.' The child may only have been there for 30 minutes in temperatures of around nine degrees. Unemployed Mr Liddell, who was with his friend, said: 'The whole thing took us totally by surprise. 'My friend held on to the baby and I went and got the concierge from the flats and the police.' 'We think the mother must have wanted the child to be found judging by where she had left it. 'Thank goodness the baby was found unharmed. 'I hope the mother is found. Who knows what kind of a state she is in?' The girl is now being cared for by staff at the Simpson's Centre for Reproductive Health at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Baby Charlotte weighs 5.7lbs (2.6kg) and all routine newborn checks have been performed. As a precaution Charlotte is being treated with antibiotics and tests have also been performed to rule out infection including Group B Strep. Maria Wilson, chief midwife, at NHS Lothian said: 'Baby Charlotte has had a good night and is doing well. 'Our staff are continuing to care for her and we hope the mum and baby can be reunited.' Charlotte was found just a short distance from the local police station and train station in a discovery which has stunned local residents. Monika Tyrrell, 70, a care worker said: 'I feel so sorry for the mother. Something serious must be the matter for her to do something like this. 'Whatever the situation, I hope she can be reunited with her baby. 'She could have had some kind of a breakdown. 'People walk past that bench all the time, there's a lot of movement. 'There's no-one around this area that I know of who looked like they might be pregnant.' As a precaution Charlotte is being treated with antibiotics and tests have also been performed to rule out infection including Group B Strep . Chief Inspector Richard Thomas of Police Scotland said the baby girl had been found in a maroon-coloured blanket before being taken to the ERI where she is now being cared for. He said: 'We believe the baby was probably lying on the bench for a short amount of time, probably less than 30 minutes. She does not seem to have suffered in any noticeable way. 'The baby was wrapped up in the blanket and had been washed and cleaned. 'It seems likely she had been found within 24 hours of being born. He added: 'At this point we are seeking to trace the mother to establish that she is safe and well and receives proper medical attention. We don't want to frighten her.' Hailesland Park resident Steven Brodie, 35, said: 'I just hope this story is going to have a happy ending. 'It's pretty shocking that whatever has happened, the mother has felt she had no other options but to dump the baby and run. 'You do hear about things like this happening from time to time, but it's pretty astonishing when it happens on your doorstep. 'It's great that the baby has been found safe and well and that it wasn't more serious. Fingers crossed everything turns out OK.' Anne Denholm, chairwoman of Wester Hailes Community Council, said the mum will have left her there knowing she would be found. She said: 'It's quite a busy park and has all been done up recently. The poor girl who left her there will need help, it's really sad. 'It's been cold outside so it's a good job she was somewhere she could easily be found. In 2005, a newborn 6lb boy was found in a plastic bag in Holyrood Park, but the mother was never found.","One-day-old baby girl discovered on park bench wrapped in blanket .

Sentenced: Christine French pocketed over £25,000 in benefits that she was not entitled to while working as a cleaner for footballers David Healy and Steve Harper . A cleaner claimed £25,000 in benefits while working for Premiership footballers who she was stealing from, a court has heard. Christine French, 57, took £20,000 in jewellery from the wives of Sunderland Striker David Healy and Newcastle goalkeeper Steve Harper, to help pay off debts of £15,000. She pleaded guilty to three counts of benefit fraud at Newcastle Crown Court where she was yesterday given a 12 month prison sentence suspended for 12 months. She trembled in the dock today as the court was told that she had fraudulently claimed between £100 and £120 a week while cleaning the homes in Ponteland's Darras Hall estate - a favourite among footballers. Defending her, Susan Hirst, said French was 'robbing Peter to try and pay Paul' after her husband of 30 years suddenly left her in a state of  financial chaos. She owed a £10,000 in loans and a further £5,000 in finance. Newcastle Crown Court heard that when she initially began claiming income support and council tax benefit in September 2003, she was entitled to the payments. However, after starting work as a cleaner on August 1 2005, she continued to claim the money, which she was no longer entitled to, until she was sacked after the thefts were noticed in late 2010. James Adkin, prosecuting, said French had fraudulently claimed a total of  £25,895.08 while working as a cleaner and offering an ironing service. Miss Hirst said that French currently has £10.80 a week deducted from her benefits to re-pay that amount. She said: 'All of the offences rose from the financial mess she was in. Her husband of 30 years left her suddenly with a huge amount of debt. Life has been a real struggle for her over the last seven to eight years. Trust: French was trusted by the family's of Mr Healy (left) and Mr Harper (right) - and even babysat the Newcastle United goalkeeper's children . 'She has been struggling with depression since her husband left her. This really has ruined her life.' Judge John Evans said that 'she would have faced immediate custody if . the matters had come to light at the same time' as the thefts. She was also given a supervision requirement for six months. In May 2011 Judge Richard Lowden sentenced French to eight months imprisonment, suspended for two years, with supervision for 12 months, after she pleaded guilty to three charges of theft relating to £20,000 worth of rings, necklaces, bracelets and earrings. At the hearing for the first offence, the court was told that French had fallen prey to the temptation of the 'wealth she was surrounded by' and pocketed jewellery belonging to the wives of Mr Harper and Mr Healy. The self employed cleaner sold or pawned the stolen items to help pay off her colossal debts. The court heard French was not only trusted to clean the homes of the families, but would also babysit the Harper's children. French was confronted and admitted what she had done. Because she owned up so quickly £14,000 worth of jewellery was recovered from pawn shops and jewellers where she had taken them.","Christine French pocketed over £25,000 .

Angler Craig Birchall is the butt of jokes after he caught one of Britain's smallest ever fish - a tiny stickleback that weighed a tenth of an ounce. Craig, 23, was looking to catch a big roach or perch fish when he cast his rod into a lake. As he relaxed on the bank his small float bobbed up and down on the surface of the water, prompting Craig to grab his rod in readiness. When he picked it up he could barely feel anything on his line but reeled it in and found a small spec on the end of his hook. On closer inspection he identified the catch as a three-spined stickleback, a common tiddler in British waters. After . laughing to himself about the catch, Craig placed the 1.5 inch-long . specimen on a set of kitchen scales and it weighed in at three drams, or . 5.1 grams. Although he . missed out on a record for the biggest ever stickleback, which stands at . four drams, Craig has caught one of the tiddliest of tiddlers ever in . British angling. Big catch: Angler Craig Birchall with the stickleback which he hooked with bait . Craig, a palletiser operator from Scunthorpe, Lincs, has been jokingly mocked by friends and family for his not-so-big catch. Popular: The three spined stickleback is the most widespread fish in UK waters . He said: 'I was just fishing for roach and perch and was using squatt as bait, which is like a maggot but smaller. 'After a while my float stated dipping up and down and I thought it might be a small perch just messing about. 'So I pulled it in, not really expecting to much on the end of the line, and saw this very small stickleback. 'I weighed it using a set of kitchen scales, took a photo and it then went back into the water safe and well. 'It is the smallest fish I have ever caught and I had no idea it was so close to the record until I checked later. 'My mum, girlfriend and family members have had a good laugh about it because the fish was so small.' Dr Mark Everard, an aquatic scientist and author of 'The Little Book of Little Fishes' said: 'The three spined stickleback is the most widespread fish in UK waters. 'They do very well in urban waters because they are quite tough. 'They are one of the most smallest species and one of the most important in the food chain as they get eaten by other fish and water birds.' The current British record for a three spined stickleback was set in 1998 by Dennis Flack in Cambridgeshire.","Fisherman Craig Birchall the butt of jokes after he hooks stickleback .

He is so small he needs round-the-clock care to build up his strength - and sleeps cuddled up to a labrador in the home of Rebekah Kennedy, 26, manager of Fishers Farm Park, in Wisborough Green, West Sussex, where he was born. Tiny: Bobby, the runt of triplets, is 10in long and stands 9in tall - so the other lambs in his flock dwarf him . Smallest: He is thought to be the world's smallest lamb - weighing in at just 2.2 pounds and only as high as a pint glass (seen here with one of his normal-sized peers) Care: Bobby is miniscule he needs round-the-clock care to build up his strength - and sleeps cuddled up to a labrador . Bobby's vital statistics have been sent . to the Guinness World Records and staff are confident he will soon be . recognised as the world's smallest lamb. Ms Kennedy said: 'I've worked here for seven years and I've never seen a lamb so small. I took Bobby home with me to help him get a bit stronger and he's improving. On the day he was born he barely bleated but now he's calling and calling to me around the house.' Ms Kennedy said Bobby is 'a bit wobbly on his feet'  but that he can walk to her across a room now. 'He's a bit like a tortoise, keeping it slow and steady,' she said. 'I've hand-reared a few lambs but none as tiny as Bobby. It's a bit like looking after a premature baby at the moment and I've been giving him antibiotics to clear his lungs up.' Fighter: Little Bobby is quarter of the size of other lambs. He has already beaten the odds as he was only given a 50 per cent chance of surviving . She said lambs should normally be three or four times Bobby's size by now. 'I've called him Bobby because I love the name, said Ms Kennedy, 'I have to feed him every two hours so . he's sleeping in a dog bed in my bedroom and I've set an alarm to wake . me up when it's time for his milk.'

'I'm really hoping we can get Bobby fit and healthy so he can get back to the farm and meet all of our visitors soon.' Kelly Bowers, an assistant at the farm, said she could not believe her eyes when she found Bobby shortly after his birth. 'We came in in the morning and Bobby had just been born. He was so small - I couldn't believe how small he was. 'His mum had licked and cleaned him and was busy pushing out the other two babies. We left her to it but once Bobby's brother and sister had entered the world we took him away because he wasn't suckling. 'All the visitors to the park have been marvelling at how tiny Bobby is and saying how cute he is and that they have never seen such a small lamb.

A woman died after her hijab caught fire on a gas cooker - and she had accidentally set her clothes alight in similar situations three times before, an inquest heard yesterday. Surayya Khan's family has helped to launch a safety campaign urging the importance of being aware of fire risk in the kitchen. The mother of three fought for life for nearly two weeks before dying of multiple organ failure at a Manchester hospital in October last year. Death: The street in Burton, Staffordshire where Surayya Khan set herself alight while cooking in her kitchen . Mrs Khan, 67, was cooking at her home in Burton, Staffordshire on September 23 when the headscarf she wore as a Muslim woman came into contact with a gas hob. Her husband Mohammed struggled frantically to save her life, but she suffered severe burns to her head and neck. The fire victim was taken to Burton Queen's Hospital by paramedics, but later transferred to Wythenshawe Hospital in Manchester for specialist treatment. Mrs Khan was placed in an induced coma and died on October 5. Fire investigator Lee Dugmore told the inquest into her death: 'Mr Khan found his wife with her clothes on fire. He removed his pullover and used it to smother the fire. 'Mrs Khan had a history of lapses in concentration. She would place her hands on the cooker for support. The most likely cause is the transfer of the naked flame from the gas hob to her clothing.' Hospital: The mother of three fought for her life at Wythenshawe Hospital but later died of her injuries . Mr Khan burnt both his hands attempting to smother the flames, and one of couple's daughters applied water to Mrs Khan's burns as they waited for an ambulance to arrive. Mr Dugmore revealed that it was thought Mrs Khan's headscarf had caught fire three times while she was cooking during the two years before her death. 'She would extinguish it with her hands or by moving to the sink,' he said. South Staffordshire coroner Andrew Haigh recorded a verdict of accidental death, saying: 'Despite treatment she did not recover. This death resulted from a genuine tragic accident.' He praised Mr Khan's efforts to save his wife, putting himself in danger and sustaining 'serious burns' himself. Staffordshire Fire and Rescue Service this week returned to the family's home to fit specialist smoke alarms, as Mr Khan suffers from hearing difficulties. Mrs Khan's death led to a campaign by fire safety officials warning people of the dangers of cooking while wearing loose clothing. As part of the campaign, her daughter Rukhsana said last October: We are devastated by the loss of our mother, but if we can help to prevent any other family from going through what we are it will be worth it. 'Saris and headscarves are loose items of clothing which could catch fire if you get too close so I would just like to remind people to take extra care in the kitchen, make sure your personal safety is your priority.'","Surayya Khan's headscarf caught fire on the cooker in September last year .

Rapist: Hesam Khosravi, 24, today had his 'unduly lenient' sentence increased from six to 11 years . An Iranian immigrant who filmed himself raping a woman at knife-point on his Apple iPad today had his 'unduly lenient' sentence nearly doubled. Hesam Khosravi, 24, kicked and beat his victim and threatened to tape her mouth up during the attack in Trafford, Greater Manchester. He was originally jailed for six years but the Court of Appeal increased his term to 11 years. Leading judges agreed with Attorney General Dominic Grieve that the original sentence was too short. Khosravi pulled his victim around by . her hair and forced her to strip and perform a sex act before raping . her, Minshull Crown Court in Manchester heard during the trial. The immigrant could be heard laughing . and commentating on the assault in Farsi as the woman cries and sobs . throughout, in footage of the attack. Police . found the recording on his iPad of the attack last April after he was arrested for an . unconnected offence - but Khosravi claimed it was consensual . ‘role-play’. Khosravi, who faces a deportation . application on his release, had taken crystal meth before the attack, . which made him ‘more aggressive’. It was argued on Mr Grieve's behalf at the Court of Appeal in London that six years failed to reflect the seriousness of the offence, the need for deterrence and the 'public concern that offences like this give rise to'. The appeal judges were told that 'aggravating' features of the case included 'deliberate and gratuitous violence' and 'degradation and humiliation', which included the filming of the crime on an iPad. Increasing Khosravi's sentence, Lady Justice Hallett, sitting with two other judges, said: 'Watching the footage was an extraordinarily unpleasant task. 'Lenient': The Iranian was given six years behind bars at Minshull Crown Court in Manchester but today the Court of Appeal in London nearly doubled that term . 'The victim's obvious pain and distress is excruciating to watch. 'How the victim must feel knowing that the recording has been shown in court and watched by outsiders one cannot imagine.' She added: 'What is particularly chilling is the offender's calm dominance throughout.' The judge said: 'The offender was determined to terrify and humiliate at the same time. He succeeded. 'His behaviour that night was simply cruel, and the lasting psychological harm he has caused is immeasurable.'","Hesam Khosravi kicked and beat victim and threatened to tape her mouth .

Demand: Sam Dunne, 19, rang murdered EastEnders actress EastEnders actress Gemma McCluski family to demand a ransom . A sick hoaxer rang murdered EastEnders actress Gemma McCluskie's family to claim he had raped her and wanted a £2million ransom. Sam Dunne, 19, of Greenhithe, Kent, . admitted calling her two brothers as police searched for the missing star. He made some of the demands to Tony McCluskie, 36, who was later jailed for a minimum of 20 years for killing her. The actress's torso was found in Regent's Canal, Hackney, last March. Her older brother battered his sister to death after a furious row over his addiction to skunk cannabis. He then used knives and a meat cleaver to cut off her limbs and head before dumping them separately in a canal. Dunne, a warehouse worker, struck after 29-year-old Gemma was reported missing from her home and her family launched an appeal to find her. More than 100 people mounted a high-profile search, which . former EastEnders stars Martine McCutcheon and Brooke Kinsella helped to . promote on Twitter. Seeing phone numbers for both Gemma's brothers on a poster, Dunne called them on Tuesday 6 March 2012. Tony McCluskie was jailed for life after he was found guilty of murdering his sister Gemma and dumping her body in a canal . He claimed he had Gemma and demanded . money for her release - the call gave hope to Gemma's family that she . was still alive as well as diverting police attention away from Tony McCluskie. Adopting a false East European accent Dunne told the family if they wanted . to see Gemma again they needed to take £2million to Benfleet . International Station. He then followed up again with a call requesting . another 500 Iraq dollars. In one of the calls, Dunne said to Tony McCluskie  that Gemma's family needed to 'sort out their attitude'. Dunne's accent kept changing during the conversation. When Tony McCluskie asked to speak to her, Dunne said Gemma was in a locked room and had been stripped and sexually assaulted. The conversations on speaker phone . were heard by several friends of the McCluskie family who had gathered . at Gemma's flat in a desperate bid to find the . star. Danny McCluskie, her other brother, also received a call with the same demands. More were made but he did not answer his phone. A statement from Gemma's cousin Leanne Dye, who listened in on the call, was read out in court. She said: 'After the phone went dead I had to run out of the room to be physically sick. I was very distressed.' Police said this one of the weapons Tony McCluskie used when he attacked his sister Gemma, who had lost patience living with him . The caller's number had been withheld but police were able to trace it and subsequently Dunne to his mother's house in Greenhithe, Kent. Murder detectives investigating . Gemma's disappearance arrested Dunne at home and found £100 of cannabis . was stuffed down his underpants. In police interview he said he had . been with friends who were joking about making calls to numbers they had . seen on a Facebook page featuring an appeal to find a missing girl. He claimed he did not dial the . numbers but he, among others, shouted demands down the phone. He . admitted he had been smoking cannabis that day. But witnesses said they heard only one voice on the phone, not several. Dunne was sentenced to six months in prison after pleading guilty at Medway Magistrates Court. Investigating officer Acting . Detective Chief Inspector John Nicholson, from the Homicide and Serious . Crime Command, said: 'Dunne acted despicably, temporarily giving hope to . Gemma's many friends and family that she was indeed still alive. It's . hard to imagine how anyone could think it was a good 'joke' to torment a . family going through such an incredibly difficult time in this way. 'Of course Tony McCluskie - who we . now know had already murdered his sister - must have thought his luck . was in as Dunne was providing him with an alibi. Within hours of these . calls, Gemma’s torso was recovered from the Regents canal in east . London. Cordoned off: A police officer by Regent's Canal in east London where Miss McCluskie's torso was found in a suitcase after being thrown into the water in March last year . 'At those early stages of the murder . investigation it was unclear who was responsible, and I had to divert . significant resources to arresting, searching and interviewing Dunne and . his associates, resources that should have been committed to other . vital aspects of the enquiry.' Last year the Old Bailey heard that Gemma was left in charge of the . family home in Shoreditch, east London, when her mother Pauline was . hospitalised with an MRSA infection after surgery to remove a brain . tumour. McCluskie spent most of the time in . his room, smoking up to 15 cannabis joints and drinking up to ten pints . of lager, fortified with shots of tequila, every day. Gemma was killed after returning from . the opening of the new Royal London Hospital in Whitechapel. Earlier in . the day friends heard her ringing McCluskie to tell him she was sick of . his cannabis habit and he would have to move out. When she arrived in the afternoon of . March 1 last year, she discovered he had left the bathroom taps running . and flooded the bathroom. 'I always loved you': Gemma's former boyfriend has left a tribute to the actress .

Matthew Bennett, 26, flew into a rage when a guest at a Christmas party made a joke he considered racist . A man has been jailed for nine years after attacking a guest at a Christmas party with a claw hammer because he made an apparently 'racist joke'. Matthew Bennett, 26, flew into a rage when fellow reveller Jon Brooks quipped 'I'm not racist because I've got a black labrador' after Bennett said he had a mixed-race sister. Bennett left the party and went home to fetch the weapon before coming back and battering Mr Brooks around the head, leaving him with permanent brain damage. Bennett, 26, was cleared of attempted murder but admitted grievous bodily harm with intent at Bristol Crown Court. Jailing him for nine years and four months yesterday, Judge Neil Ford said: 'You accept that what you did was a wholly disproportionate, wicked and dangerous act. 'You aimed a blow at him with the intention of causing really serious harm.' The attack happened at a party thrown by the pair's mutual friend Stephen Martin in Patchway, Bristol, in the early hours of Christmas Day last year. Mark Hollier, prosecuting, said seven men in their 20s gathered to drink and take cocaine and ecstasy but added: 'There was no overt hostility or aggression.' Mr Brooks, 30, made his 'joke' when Bennett mentioned he had a sister of mixed race. Bennett, of Patchway, then went to his girlfriend's house to collect a hammer before returning to the party, where he smashed Mr Brooks on the leg without warning. He accused him of making fun of him and then struck him a powerful blow to the head. The court heard Mr Brooks' eyes rolled up into his head and he collapsed to the floor. Judge Neil Ford jailed Bennett at Bristol Crown Court yesterday for the 'wholly disproportionate, wicked and dangerous act' He was taken to nearby Frenchay Hospital and found to have suffered a depressed skull fracture, and fragments of bone had penetrated his brain. Bennett, a father-of-one who has another child on the way, was arrested on Christmas Day and claimed he had aimed for Mr Brooks' shoulder but hit his head by mistake. Timothy Rose, defending, said: 'He has confronted his guilt and his responsibility for what he did that night. 'He has insight into the consequences, is self-critical and genuinely remorseful. He apologises for what he did that night. He extends his apology to the victim.' Former warehouse worker Mr Brooks spent 12 days in hospital and was left with speech and mobility impairment. He told the court: 'I was in an induced coma for three days. My family thought I was going to die.""I only met Bennett twice, and the third time ended with this.' Mr Brooks is still recovering and is slowly regaining use of the right side of his body, which was paralysed after Bennett's savage assault. After the court case ended on Thursday, he said: 'I sat there in hospital and did it myself. It was like learning to speak and move all over again.' Mr Brooks' sister Sophie said: 'The family went through hell.

Dumped boyfriend Robbie Hayball (pictured) taunted his ex-lover on the phone as he plunged to his death in his van over a 350ft cliff . A dumped boyfriend taunted his ex-lover on the phone as he plunged to his death in his van over a 350ft cliff, an inquest heard today. Chef Robbie Hayball, 20, left the line open so Shannon Woodford, 21, could hear his screams as he ploughed through a fence, and onto rocks below. The father-of-two had taken his white van to the top of the beauty spot just minutes after she told him their four year relationship was over. He then told her when she phoned: 'I'm glad you called, listen to this...' Distraught Miss Woodford told the . inquest: 'I heard a loud rustling sound, a loud scream and the phone . made some more noises before going off.' Mr Hayball died instantly as his van was smashed to pieces when it landed on the jagged rocks below. Newport . Coroner's Court court heard Mr Hayball was devastated at living apart . from his children during the couple's 'on-off' relationship. He had stormed out of her flat into the night following a row in which he had become violent. Miss Woodford told him it was over and she didn't want to see him again. The full-time mother wept as she told the inquest, in Newport, Isle of Wight, about their last angry words to each other. The couple had been on a 'date night' to see Taken 2 at the cinema in a bid to patch up their problems. He . confessed he had mounting troubles, was staying on his mum's sofa, his . car was broken, and without her and the kids he had 'nothing left to . live for'. Devastated Miss Woodford listened in . terror to Mr Hayball's scream as he plummeted to his death off Culver . Cliffs, Isle of Wight, at around 3am. Shannon Woodford, (right) former partner of Robbie Hayball, described how she heard her boyfriend plunge to his death, while his mother Yowapha (left) wept at the inquest . He ploughed through a barbed wire fence and onto the rocks below. Miss . Woodford, who has a three-year-old son and two-year-old daughter, said: . 'After Rob left he called me again and again trying to tell me he was . sorry but I told him it was over. 'I told him I didn't want to see him again and that it was over. 'Then . he sent me a text saying ""Give the kids a kiss goodbye. I hope you can . live with yourself. It is for the best, goodnight x"". Culver Cliff near Sandown, Isle Of Wight pictured here, where the incident happened . 'I called him straight back and he said: ""I am glad you called me so you can hear this, listen to this...' 'Then I heard him drive through the fence and over the cliff. 'I didn't know where he was - he had told me he was driving up 'a big hill'. 'Next I heard a loud rustling sound, a loud scream and the phone made some more noises before going off.' Miss Woodford tried to ring again, but . could not get through and dialled 999 to raise the alarm with police on . October 11 last year. Members of the H.M. Coastguard Search and Rescue team scanned the area where Mr Hayball died . Coastguards and the RNLI launched a search operation and Mr Hayball's white van was spotted submerged 5 feet beneath the waves at the base of the cliff. Trackmarks were found at the top of the steep drop, in White Cliff Bay. Pouring rain, strong winds and turbulent seas hampered efforts by two RNLI crews to reach the vehicle. Specially trained teams winched down the cliff face to get close to it and saw the rear door of the van was swinging open. Best friend Jack Fraser-Noble, leaving the court, said Mr Hayball didn't express his feelings very well . Mr Hayball's body was eventually found wedged under rocks and recovered, but his van was washed away. A final text to friends and relatives at 2.38am had read: 'I am sorry but she has driven me insane. 'Thank you all but don't let my kids think that I was the one. It's her - pure poison.' His grieving mother Yowapha Hayball, from Newport, sobbed during today's hearing and left as Isle of Wight Coroner Caroline Sumeray read out results of the post-mortem. It revealed Mr Hayball died of multiple injuries following trauma. Tests showed he was nearly double the drink drive limit. Miss Woodford said the pair had an 'on-off' relationship. Mr Hayball's brother, Jason Hayball, 18, from Newport, said his brother had not seemed depressed when he saw him earlier that evening but he had felt under pressure. Mr Hayball said: 'Everything added up to stress him out - his relationship, where to live, his kids and money. 'The stress of having to keep the relationship going because he had to see the kids got to him.' Best friend Jack Fraser-Noble, 21, paid tribute to Mr Hayball, who had worked 60 hour weeks to support his family and renovated cars and motorbikes in his spare time. Mr Fraser-Noble said: 'He didn't express his feelings very well, I think that was his downfall. 'I had no idea that things were so bad. He was a motivated person who wanted to get on in life.' Recording an open verdict, Mrs Sumeray said: 'This was a young man saddled with children a lot earlier than he had intended in life. 'I have heard how he had ambitions and was a good chap, a good friend. 'I think his mind was clouded by fury and alcohol, distress and anger at all the stresses in his life.' Loved ones have set up a shrine at the cliffs, regularly laying flowers at a cross in Mr Hayball's memory.

'Hounslow slasher': Sasha Masamba, 21, attacked two women with knives as they walked home at night . A man dubbed the 'Hounslow slasher' and described as a 'every woman's nightmare' has today been given an 18-year sentence. Sasha Masamba, 21, attacked two women with knives as they walked home at night, leaving them with permanent scars around their face and neck. He was said to be particularly dangerous because there was no motive to the attacks which terrorised women in suburban streets in west London. Masamba, of Hounslow, west London, pleaded guilty to two offences of wounding with intent to cause grievous bodily harm. He was jailed at the Old Bailey for 18 years - four of them to be served on licence. The Recorder of London, Judge Brian Barker, said: 'This is a most disturbing case. 'Noticeably, there was no request for money or sexual intent. The deep concern is a lack of any rational explanation for these acts. 'The victims could easily have died because the knife wounds were near arteries.' The Old Bailey heard that, over 10 days in August last year, Masamba prowled the area around Hounslow station and on two occasions slashed women late at night. Bobbie Cheema, QC, prosecuting, told the court: 'This defendant is every woman’s nightmare - a man who arms himself with a knife and then prowls around late at night waiting for a lone female to attack. Scroll down for CCTV . Caught: He was arrested at Hounslow station by new recruit Pc Rebecca Skinner on August 21 after she recognised his CCTV image which had been released to the media . Vicious: He attacked women them with permanent scars around their face and neck . 'He targeted, followed and then assaulted the innocent women walking home from public transport.' She said the women were attacked from . behind. In one case, Masamba had been prowling around for three hours . looking for a victim. The first attack was on university student Miss Zablocka, 19, who had only been in Britain for two weeks. She was walking home from the station just before midnight after spending the evening with friends in the West End. The man grabbed her throat and then said: 'Sorry, I am only joking.' She did not realise she had been cut but after he made off she felt dizzy and fell to her knees. Miss Zablocka was taken to hospital and had seven stitches to a 3cm wound. She also had a continuous cut stretching round her neck. 'I want to bite your ears . off, pluck your eyes with chopsticks, cut your limbs with a breadknife . and feed your insides to sever rats.' Masamba on his Facebook page . On August 17, Masamba attacked . waitress Miss Aurelio as she was heading home from work in central . London. He approached her from behind and she saw a breadknife as he . slashed her across the chin. Miss Cheema said she put up a fierce . fight during which Masamba tried to stab her twice in the stomach. The . knife was later found in a nearby street and had DNA from attacker and . victim. She was said to be awaiting plastic surgery for a 5cm scar on her face. Both women were said to have been traumatised by the attacks and are afraid of going out alone at night. Miss Cheema said a couple of days later, Masamba posted threats on his Facebook page. They said: 'I want to bite your ears . off, pluck your eyes with chopsticks, cut your limbs with a breadknife . and feed your insides to sever rats.' Masamba was said to have written to the judge saying he hated himself for what he had done. He was arrested at Hounslow station . by new recruit Pc Rebecca Skinner on August 21 after she recognised his . CCTV image which had been released to the media. His not-guilty pleas to the attempted . murders of Kaja Zablocka, 19, on August 7 and Deserilyn Aurelio, 26, 10 . days later were accepted. DCI Amanda Hargreaves said outside court: 'This lengthy sentence reflects the nature of the offences. 'Masamba was caught before he potentially killed someone, which I believe was only a matter of time.' Later, police released a statement from Miss Aurelio in which she said: 'The night I was attacked it just felt like a small cut to my chin at first, but the next day I realised how serious it was and became more and more scared. 'I have lost my confidence and avoid being outside alone at night. 'I have an awful scar on my face, it is very visible on my chin, this is a constant reminder of the attack and how close I came to being killed. 'I am still waiting for plastic surgery on the scar so I can then hopefully begin to look at myself as normal again. 'I am still very self-conscious of the scar. People stare at it and often ask what happened. This always upsets me as it reminds me of that horrible night.'","Sasha Masamba, 21, attacked two women .

Appearance: Fred Talbot, 63, is seen in public today for the first time since his arrest as he leaves his home in Bowden, Cheshire . TV weatherman Fred Talbot steps out in public today - for the first time since his arrest on suspicion of sexually abusing four schoolboys. Wrapped up in warm winter clothing, the 63-year-old presenter was seen leaving his house after being arrested on suspicion of indecent assault and inciting a child to commit acts of gross indecency. The allegations relate to former pupils at Altrincham Grammar School, Greater Manchester, between the early 1970s and early 1980s. Talbot was a biology teacher at the school before he became a television weatherman in 1984, . Today the weatherman dressed in a woolly hat, puffa jacket and grey trousers made a bid not to be seen leaving his £500,000 semi detached cottage in Bowdon, Cheshire where he had been holed up since his arrest. After checking the coast was clear out of the window, the former ITV's This Morning presenter tentatively peeked round his front door before emerging on foot for a walk. Sources close to Talbot said he was 'devastated' by his arrest on Tuesday. One friend said: 'This investigation has hit Fred very hard and he just wants to clear his name. He denies any wrong-doing and he simply cannot understand why this is happening to him. 'Fred's a very popular down to earth figure in the area is a regular at local pubs and he is mortified that people will talking about this investigation.' The inquiry into Talbot was sparked after publicity about a separate investigation into allegations of historic sexual abuse of pupils at a nearby Catholic boys school. The presenter who became famous for his 'floating map' reports in Liverpool's Albert Dock for Richard and Judy's This Morning show on ITV, was on a cruise in the Caribbean when his 18th century cottage was raided by police December 11 last year. Officers broke in through the front door and searched the property for clues but spent a further four months investigating before arresting him. He has now been bail until August. Detectives said they were appealing for more information to help with their investigation. They said the alleged offences did not take place within school grounds. Venturing out: Talbot looked out of the window and peered out of the front door to check the coast was clear before leaving his home today . TV weatherman: Fred Talbot, wearing one of his iconic knitted jumpers, and his ITV This Morning weather map . Talbot has not taken 'off air' at ITV's Granada Reports North West news programme although he was not formally suspended. Today his agent Dave Warwick said: 'He has not been charged with anything so there is nothing to formally deny. There is nothing further to say.' In a recent interview Talbot said he had been 'left in limbo' following the police raid. Brought up in Altrincham, Talbot was a pupil at North Cestrian Grammar School and in 1964 was a founding member of the Altrincham and District Astronomical Society. Search: A police van parked outside the weatherman's home on Tuesday as he was questioned by police over historic sex abuse allegations . He co-discovered a meteor shower, the June Lyrids, in June 1966. During one famous incident whilst presenting the weather on This Morning at Albert Dock in Liverpool, a streaker swam naked up to the map and jumped on. In 1998, Talbot was named 'Weatherman of the year' at the Annual International Weather Festival in Paris and also acted as a weather forecaster on ITV Breakfast programme Daybreak. In 2007 Talbot was awarded the honorary degree of Doctor of Science by Manchester Metropolitan University in recognition of bringing to a mass audience, 'a better understanding of scientific and environmental issues.'

"By . James Rush . PUBLISHED: . 12:18 EST, 11 April 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:46 EST, 12 April 2013 . David Archer, who is thought to be Britain's most prolific shoplifter, has been jailed for his 342nd offence . A man who is thought to be Britain's most prolific shoplifter has been jailed for his 342nd offence. David Archer, who targets charity shops, was jailed today for a total of 18 months after admitting two new shoplifting offences and two breaches of an ASBO. The 58-year-old homeless man, who had been staying in Mostyn, in Flintshire, admitted stealing clothing and a camera from an RSPCA charity shop in Colwyn Bay and a Carer's Trust charity box from the Co-op store in Llandudno Junction, as well as two breaches of an ASBO banning him from charity shops. Mold Crown Court heard how he wrote a letter to the judge saying he had in the past donated to charities because he appreciated the work they did. He said he had stolen because he wanted to keep warm during the cold weather. But Judge Rhys Rowlands asked the defendant, who is said to have started stealing at the age of ten, how stealing a charity box or a camera would help keep him warm. He said: 'I don't know if he takes me for a fool, but I am not. I don't accept a word of what he says in relation to that.' The court was told Archer had 338 previous convictions - 261 for shoplifting, other thefts and burglary, along with 11 previous convictions for breaching an ASBO which bans him from all charity shops and prevents him possessing a charity box. It was almost 48 years since he first offended at the age of ten by stealing from a shop in Denbigh. Judge Rowlands said he 'shuddered to think' what Archer must have cost his victims and the state over the years. 'You have a dreadful record and a history of targeting charities,' he said. 'You have repeatedly chosen to breach the ASBO now on 13 occasions. 'It is one of the most depressing criminal records that I have seen for a while.' The judge said it would be unjust to ignore that Archer's victims were charities. 'Rarely does a court have to deal with someone so determined to breach an order designed to protect charitable institutions,' he said. Archer was jailed for stealing a charity box for The Carer's Trust from the Co-op store in Llandudno Junction . Prosecutor Gareth Parry told how Archer stole clothing and a camera from the RSPCA charity shop in Colwyn Bay and a Carer's Trust charity box from the Co-op store in Llandudno Junction. He also admitted two breaches of an indefinite ASBO imposed in 2006 which, among other things, prohibited him from entering any charity shop in England and Wales and from possessing charity boxes. Mr Parry said Archer was seen on CCTV burning a piece of string which secured the charity box in aid of carers, which was on the counter at the Llandudno Junction store. He bought a bottle of brandy but hid the charity box in his clothing. He was seen stealing from the RSPCA shop and police were alerted. Archer also admitted stealing clothing and a camera from the RSPCA charity shop in Colwyn Bay and two breaches of an ASBO . In mitigation, Andrew McInnes said Archer had been released from prison without funds and had nowhere to live. Archer - who claims to have spent 28 years in prison and every Christmas but one in the last 40 behind bars - was stuck in a cycle of being released, re-offending because of his difficulties with alcohol and drugs and then being sent back to prison. The court heard he was motivated to change but there was no hostel accommodation available to him. The court was told the defendant had no contact with his family, suffered from osteoporosis and wanted to change his ways.","David Archer jailed for 18 months after admitting four new offences .

Warning: Richard Jones, 41, was told he must complete 'work-related activities' or face having his benefits suspended . A man who lost his leg in an accident has been told he has to get a job just weeks after being told  he was 'fully disabled and unfit for work'. Richard Jones, from Barrow, Cumbria, has been on benefits since 2000 when he suffered a shattered pelvis, damage to his spinal cord, and reduced use of his right arm. Then in 2008 he was involved in a biking accident in which he broke his tibia and fibula then two years later had to have his right leg amputated. In February, the Department for Work and Pensions told him he could keep his benefits. But this week he has been told he has to complete 'work-related activities' or face having his benefits suspended. 'That . letter from the Department for Work and Pensions dated February 8 says . I'm fully disabled and unfit for work,' he said, 'so why are they now . saying just six weeks later that I have to be looking for work when . clearly I can't?' The father-of-four said his disabilities - combined with dyslexia that renders him unable to read or write - made him unemployable. He . said he never knew from one day to the next whether he was able to fit . his prosthetic leg, be reliant on crutches or even his wheelchair for . mobility. 'If I could work I . would, but I can't do anything,' he said. 'It's not just me, I know of . other people that have been struck off. 'There's a man down the road . who's being struck off now and he's got cerebral palsy and can hardly . walk, has a crook hand and he's being forced to work.' Disabilities: He had to have his right leg amputated in 2010 following a motorcycle accident. He was confirmed as 'fully disabled' and 'unfit to work' just six weeks ago . The charity Scope has described the government's Personal Independence Payment reforms as 'fundamentally flawed' and will adversely impact on an estimated 600,000 people nationally. 'In 2013, disabled people are struggling to make ends meet,' Scope chief executive Richard Hawkins said. 'Life costs more if you're disabled. But this year living costs are spiralling and income is flat-lining. Disability Living Allowance needs reforming and could be better targeted to meet the extra costs people face,' he added, 'but disabled people are frightened by the government's plans. 'They believe it's just an excuse to cut their support.' Tough: Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Iain Duncan Smith has made it tougher to claim disability benefits . A spokesman for the DWP said it does not comment on individual cases. The latest in a series of radical changes to the welfare system come into effect on April 8 – with most benefits being uprated by just one per cent, below inflation, and disability living allowance (DLA) being replaced with a new personal independence payment (PIP). Official figures suggest that 71 per cent of those being paid DLA get the benefit 'without systematic checks' and that there has been a sharp increase in parts of Britain, notably the North East and the North West, in the run-up to reform. Claims for disability benefit had more than doubled in some parts of the country as people scramble to 'get ahead' of the tough new regime. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the surge was an illustration of the need to reform a 'ridiculous' system which has seen the numbers claiming spiral to 3.2 million, at a cost to taxpayers of £13.2 billion. This is about the same as the entire budget of the Department for Transport.","Richard Jones, 41, has been on benefits since accident 13 years ago .
