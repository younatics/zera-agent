David Cameron is ready to take Spain to the European courts over 'totally disproportionate' checks at the border with Gibraltar. Government lawyers are now examining whether Madrid has broken the law on a right to free movement in the EU, Downing Street said. The dramatic threat of legal action comes as British warships set sail for Gibraltar today in a show of naval strength. Proud moment: Crowds watch as the helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious leaves Portsmouth to take part in a deployment codenamed Cougar '13 in the Mediterranean and the Gulf . Legal action: David Cameron, pictured today on a visit to Watford, is threatening Spanish PM Mariano Rajoy with . legal action over 'politically-motivated' delays at the Spain-Gibraltar . border . Putting the brakes on: Mr Cameron admits the legal threat is 'unprecedented'. The Prime Minister spent the day promoting cycling, with Olympians Chris Hoy and Victoria Pendleton . Waved off: Helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious leaves Portsmouth to take part in a deployment codenamed Cougar '13 in the Mediterranean and the Gulf . On a mission: Relatives of navy personnel wave as the helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious departs Portsmouth . Three ships including the frigate HMS . Westminster depart for Gibraltar today, with ministers boasting it will . demonstrate the Royal Navy’s ‘formidable strength’. Madrid . has imposed draconian border controls and suggested that a £43 fee . could be imposed on every vehicle entering or leaving the outpost . through Gibraltar’s fenced border with Spain. It . came after the British territory began work on a concrete reef in the . Mediterranean which Spain claims will destroy fishing in the area. Mr Cameron warned his Spanish counterpart Mariano Rajoy last week that the draconian checks had to end. But . there was a repeat of long delays at the weekend, with the Royal . Gibraltar Police yesterday tweeted that Guardia Civil checks had caused . queues of up to two hours at the border, with Spanish officers checking . 'every car' going onto the Rock. Today . the Prime Minister's spokesman said: 'We feel that these ongoing border . delays as a result of these border checks are politically-motivated and . totally disproportionate.

Sailing off: Relatives of navy personnel wave as the helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious departs Portsmouth . The government believes the controls could be illegal under EU law, contrary to the right to free movement. 'This would be an unprecedented step so we want to consider it carefully before making a decision to pursue, but the Prime Minister is disappointed by what's happened over the weekend,' the spokesman added. 'If we go down this route then we will certainly press the European Union to pursue the case as a matter of urgency. 'We will continue to reiterate to the Spanish our position that they need to de-escalate the issue on border checks.' The European Commission is warning Spain it must ensure 'smooth and efficient border crossings' including following rules set out in the Free Movement Directive and the Schengen Borders Code. A source said: 'The Commission is of course following the situation on the ground and is in contact at technical level with its Spanish counterparts in order to organise jointly a visit on the spot, foreseen for the month of September.'

He added: ‘The Spanish authorities . have decided, for no good reason, to revive the border checks and . general harassment of the Franco epoch. ‘They . are causing delay and botheration and they are now threatening a tax on . goods vehicles going to the Rock. That is illegal under EU law, and . tantamount to a blockade. They must stop it all, and pronto.’ As . diplomatic relations between Britain and Spain were plunged into the . deep freeze, the Ministry of Defence announced details of the naval . deployment to the region, called Cougar ’13.

Appeal: David Cameron asked the Spanish Prime Minister to scale back contentious border checks with the British territory, including blocking flights to Gibraltar . Exhausting: Drivers wait in the sweltering heat to enter Spain, after the Spanish authorities increased border checks at the border with Gibraltar . Spain is also considering the possibility of raising the matter of Gibraltar at the UN's General Assembly or the International Court of Justice at The Hague.

The list of San Diego Mayor Bob Filner's sexual harassment victims just keeps getting longer and lewder. Not only did he inappropriately interact with a mayoral staffer, campaign volunteer and constituent - it seems the mayor targeted female veterans who had been raped while in the military. At least eight female military veterans are among the total 13 women who have come forward to claim that the San Diego mayor sexually harassed them, from hitting on them to groping. Two of the veterans, Eldonna Fernandez and Gerri Tindley, shared their stories of the predatory Filner with CNN Wednesday. Scroll down for video . Used and abused: Military veterans Eldonna Fernandez, left, and Gerri Tindley, right, were both victims of rape while in the service. Both claim to have been sexually harassed by Bob Filner at an event to help abused female vets . These new accusations come after the San Diego mayor was asked to resign by long-time supporters after several credible sources came forward saying Filner sexually harassed them. But Filner refused to resign, and took a two-week leave of absence Monday to attend therapy instead. Eldonna Fernandez met Filner at a National Women's Veterans Association of America 'Healing and Hiring Fair' when he was still a U.S. Congressman serving as chairman of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs . Ms Fernandez, a retired master sergeant from the Air Force, had served 23 years in the military and says she was raped three times during her service. She never reported her rapes because she believed the system would not support her. Now she speaks about her abuse and is an active member of the NWVAA. At the fair, Ms Fernandez exchanged business cards with Filner at the event, and very quickly he asked her if she was married. 'You're beautiful, and I can't take my eyes off you, and I want to take you to dinner,' she recalls him saying. She said OK and later received a 'creepy' phone call from the congressman. 'Hi, it's your newly favorite congressman, Bob Filner. You know, the one who fell in love with you at your last speech.' He proceeded to ask Ms Fernandez to dinner, but she never called him back. Not leaving: Despite being asked to resign by his own supporters, Filner announced at a press conference July 26 that he was taking a two-week leave of absence to go to therapy . Gerri Tindley, another veteran, was at the same event when Filner made inappropriate advances on her. The two were both scheduled to speak at the event and met in the green room. Ms Tindley was going to speak about the violent rape she experienced during her eight years in the service, and the son she had from the assault. Filner asked about the rape, and then attempted to 'comfort' her by getting as close as he could on the couch and rubbing her 'like he cared.' Ms Tindley was so uncomfortable with Filner's touches that she almost fell off the couch trying to put space between the two of them. Tara Jones, president of the NWVAA says she has spoken to seven to eight women with different encounters of sexual assault by Filner. Victim: Fernandez thought she deleted her voicemail from Filner but rediscovered it in the trash section of her phone when allegations that the mayor committed acts of sexual harassment came out . 'He went to dinners, asked women out to dinners, grabbed breasts, buttocks. The full gamut. Everything that is complete violation of what we stand for,' Jones told CNN. 'He's a sexual predator. And he used this organization for his own personal agenda.' Ms Jones believes the other military veterans, most of them abuse victims, were targeted because of their past. 'He preyed upon people who were vulnerable, who he knew nine times out of 10 would not speak up,' she said. But they did speak up, and now they are angry. 'He's part of an organization that's against sexual assault and sexual violence against women and sexual harassment and he's doing the very thing that we are fighting to make stop in our service and in our country,' Ms Fernandez said. 'He didn't have our backs, he was looking at our backs.'","At least eight female military veterans - most of them abuse victims - claim San Diego Mayor Bob Filner sexually assaulted them .

"By . Pa Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:15 EST, 14 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 13:23 EST, 14 July 2013 . More British soldiers and veterans committed suicide last year than were killed in battle, it has been reported. The Ministry of Defence confirmed that in 2012 seven serving soldiers were confirmed to have killed themselves, while a further 14 died in suspected suicides but inquests had yet to be held. The Government does not record suicides among former soldiers, but an investigation by the BBC's Panorama found at least 29 veterans also took their own lives last year. Tragic: Rates of suicide among soldiers and veterans in 2012 greater than number killed in action. Stock picture of British soldiers of the 1st battalion of the Royal Welsh patrolling streets in Southern Afghanistan, in February . The 50 suicides compares with 40 soldiers who died in action in Afghanistan during the same period. A spokesman for the MoD said suicide among members of the Armed Forces remains 'extremely rare' and is lower than comparative rates in the civilian population. Panorama said it wrote to every coroner in the country to ask for the names of soldiers and veterans who killed themselves last year and also analysed newspaper reports of coroners' inquests. Lance Sergeant Dan Collins who survived a bomb blast while serving in Helmand Province in Afghanistan in 2009, killed himself while still a serving soldier on New Year's Eve 2011 after suffering with Post Traumatic Stress Disorder, the BBC reported. His mother Deana told Panorama her son was a 'victim of war' and his name should be added to the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire which honours the military casualties of every conflict since WWII. 'Soldiers with PTSD are exactly the same. They're victims of war and they should be treated exactly the same,' she said. Commodore Andrew Cameron, chief . executive of Combat Stress, said: 'Every suicide by a soldier or veteran . is one too many but 50 in one year is desperately sad. Although figures reveal there were 50 suicides among service personnel and veterans in 2012, the MoD says it remains 'extremely rare' 'Our thoughts go out to the families . and friends affected. If confirmed, these figures remind us that serving . in the armed forces can be very traumatic and can result in . psychological as well as physical wounds. 'The priority now needs to be to . ensure that the NHS must have a greater understanding of how to support . soldiers and veterans suffering from Service-related mental ill-health. 'The NHS and emergency services are . generally the first organisations to have contact with a veteran in . emotional turmoil. We are working with the NHS to increase awareness and . improve responsiveness to veterans who need help and treatment when . they are in crisis. 'A greater focus should be placed on . identifying soldiers and veterans suffering in silence with mental . wounds so they can get the help and support required before it is too . late.' An MoD spokesman said: 'Every suicide is a tragedy and our thoughts remain with the families of all those who have sadly taken their own lives. 'Mental health of our personnel and veterans is a top priority for the Government, that is why we have committed £7.4 million to ensure there is extensive mental health support in place for everyone who needs it. The Panorama special, Broken By Battle, will be broadcast on BBC One tomorrow at 9pm.","Research found 50 soldiers and veterans killed themselves last year .

'Bemused': The IPCC today criticised the decision to give PC Shaun Jenkins his job back after having sex while on duty in Caerphilly, South Wales . An armed policeman who had sex with a married woman while on duty has been allowed to keep his job because his gun was within reach – attached to the trousers which were around his ankles. PC Shaun Jenkins, 36, was on patrol when he picked up a woman in an armed response vehicle and took her back to his house for 40 minutes while his colleague waited outside. Jenkins was later sacked for gross misconduct after the woman’s husband found out about the afternoon liaison and reported his love rival to police bosses. But the award-winning officer was reinstated after an appeal ruling that his gun was never out of his control and he would have been able to respond to an emergency. Yesterday the decision to give Jenkins his job back was criticised by the Independent Police Complaints Commission. Head of the IPCC in Wales, Tom Davies, said he was ‘bemused’ by the findings of the Police Appeals Panel. He said: ‘The finding that the gun was never out of PC Jenkins’s direct and immediate control because it was in a holster, attached to his trousers, which were attached to him, albeit around his ankles, is surprising.’ He continued: ‘I am also bemused by the panel’s conclusion that his conduct did not significantly downgrade the protection to the public because there was nothing to suggest he could not have been back in the police vehicle within a minute or two. ‘These findings can only undermine public confidence in the credibility of the police discipline system.’ Mr Davies also said the way Gwent Police dealt with a complaint about PC Jenkins from the husband of the woman he had sex with was ‘unacceptable’. PC Jenkins was on duty in Caerphilly in April 2010 when he invited the woman, who he knew, to his home for sex. An investigation by Gwent Police initially resulted in a final written warning but when the IPCC told the force to treat PC Jenkins’s actions as gross misconduct he was sacked. However in April 2012 he successfully appealed against his dismissal and was reinstated. PC Jenkins had already won a bravery award when he was caught having sex on duty. And after being reinstated he won a Chief Constable’s Award for bravery after clinging for over an hour to a suicidal woman who was threatening to jump off a railway bridge. Despite his awards Mr Davies said PC Jenkins’ behaviour and the force’s handling of the complaint against him were ‘unacceptable’. He said: ‘Any officer having sex on duty is unacceptable behaviour that falls well below what is expected of all police officers. ‘Those who carry firearms are rightly subject to the highest standards of training, procedures and discipline. ‘The manner in which this complaint was originally handled by Gwent Police is unacceptable and their attempts to “fast-track” the complaint and deal with it outside the formal regulations are not good enough.’ Criticism: A panel at Gwent Police (HQ pictured) gave the PC his job back because they believed he had control of his gun and could have left the tryst if there was an emergency . A spokesman for Gwent Police . responded: ‘We note and fully accept the findings of the IPCC report . which was critical of the Force’s handling of a complaint against a . serving officer. ‘Our complaints handling processes . have been reviewed and improved as part of our on-going efforts to . ensure we provide the best possible service to the public.’ Earlier this year a married PCSO was . jailed for seven years for misconduct in public office after he engaged . in sexual affairs while he was supposed to be on uniformed patrol. Peter Bunyan, 40, would track down . phone numbers and addresses of women while on duty using the database . with Devon and Cornwall police. The father-of-two had affairs with . four women before and during his policing shift – sleeping with one . lover up to ten times when he was on duty. He was found guilty in March of . neglecting his duties after it emerged he would turn his police radio . down on shifts while having sex with women, as well as encouraging one . mentally ill woman to send explicit pictures of herself on email to the . police station. He was convicted of sleeping with . four women and illegally accessing data relating to three lovers on the . Criminal Information System. In the same month police officer Lee . Wilcox, 45, was jailed for nine months after he had sex with a . vulnerable woman he met on duty. The married father had helped the woman on two occasions while working as a PC with South Yorkshire Police.","PC Shaun Jenkins picked up lover for 40-minute tryst with colleague outside .

San Diego’s troubled mayor is in more hot water as his former director of communications brings further allegations of inappropriate sexual behavior against him. Irene McCormack Jackson filed a lawsuit on Monday alleging that Mayor Bob Filner sexually harassed her, put her in a headlock on multiple occasions, dragging her 'around like a rag doll,' and said ‘crude and disgusting’ things to her. The lawsuit, seeking unspecified damages, was filed in San Diego County Superior Court by celebrity attorney Gloria Allred on behalf of Jackson, 57, a former journalist and employee of the San Diego Port District. Public accusations: Irene McCormack Jackson filed lawsuit Monday alleging that San Daniego Bob Filner sexually harassed her, put her in a headlock on multiple occasions and said 'crude and disgusting' things to her . Out in the open: Jackson, left, talks about the alleged sexual misconduct she suffered at the hands of San Diego Mayor Bib Filner as her attorney Gloria Allred, right, listens . Allred said Filner had repeatedly asked Jackson when they could have sex and asked her on several occasions to ‘come to work without panties.’ Jackson, who now works in a different position at San Diego’s City Hall, is the first alleged victim of Filner to make her accusations against Filner publicly. Jackson and Allred called on the 70-year-old mayor to resign. ‘A man who lacks character makes a mockery of his ideas,’ Jackson said at a news conference Monday evening. Allred said Filner needs to stop ‘treating women as pieces of meat,’ adding that his video apology was inadequate and that his statement that ‘I need help’ is not enough. ‘Do you need help to know that making vile and disgusting sexual comments is wrong,’ Allred said. Allred also announced that the council is undertaking investigations into Filner's use of a credit card during a trip to Paris, his dealings with a land developer, and his absence during a key vote about the city's pension plan. Jackson, who became the Democratic . mayor's director of communications because she said she ‘believed in . him’ at the time, did not take questions during or after the press . conference. Media field day: Allred and Jackson held a news conference on Monday where they revealed details regarding their accusations of sexual misconduct against Filner . More fire: Allred also announced that the council is undertaking investigations into Filner's use of a credit card during a trip to Paris, his dealings with a land developer, and his absence during a key vote about the city's pension plan . Within the past few weeks, a growing number of details have emerged about how Filner reportedly kissed constituents and groped female staffers. The San Diego mayor released a cryptic video two weeks ago apologizing for ‘inappropriate’ behavior towards women in his office but refused to resign, saying that he planned to get help. His refusal to leave his post as the city's first Democratic mayor in two decades has prompted some of his closest allies to come forward and reveal more about his alleged inappropriateness. The women in his office became so used to his advances that they coined the names 'the Filner headlock' and 'the Filner dance' for the times when he would corner women and make sexual advancements. In front of it: San Diego Mayor Bob Filner released a statement apologizing for his mistreatment of women that he worked with, and did so before any of the women came forward to rehash specific details . On top of that, his former fiancée . released a statement saying that his behavior became 'more aggressive, . standard decorum seemed to disappear' and played a major role in her . decision to end the engagement a week before he released his video . apology. 'Bob recently began texting other . women sexually explicit messages and setting up dates while in my . presence and within my line of vision,' his ex Bronwyn Ingram told local . station KPBS. 'I have . witnessed a severe deterioration in Bob's ability to engage with anyone . in a civil manner, myself included. During our trip to Paris, he . screamed at me in public without provocation, among other inappropriate . and disrespectful acts. 'Anyone . embroiled in so many serious controversies is impaired in ability to . run a city. The mayor's office is now paralyzed, engaging only in . defensive posturing and struggling to survive. 'I therefore urge Bob to put the best interest of the people of San Diego first and submit his resignation.' Filner's fiancee Bronwyn Ingram (L) walked out on him just days before he released an apologetic video, and later made her own statement bashing his behavior . Aside from his ex-fiancée, none . of the women who allege that Filner harassed them have come forward, . choosing instead to talk through lawyer Marco Gonzalez. He . told The Los Angeles Times that the mayor would allegedly begin by . making lewd comments to the women in question, and continue to ramp up . their interactions by cornering them and then forcibly kissing them. In some cases, he would grab the breast or butt of female staffers. While no charges have been filed, the attorney floated the possibility that they will file lawsuits against the 70-year-old. 'This . mayor cannot control himself... He does not deserve to be the mayor of . this city any longer,' Gonzalez said at a press conference outside of . City Hall. Bob Filner became San Diego's first mayor in 20 years from the Democratic Party when he assumed office in 2012, coming off of a 20-year career in the U.S. Congress . The continued calls by Gonzalez as well as friends and longtime political allies, have not changed Filner's stance, however. 'I’m . not going to resign, and here’s why: as your elected mayor, I fully . expect to be accountable to the citizens of San Diego for all of my . actions,' he said at a press conference. 'But . as a citizen of this country, I also expect -- and am entitled to-- due . process, and the opportunity to respond in a fair and impartial venue . to specific allegations. 'I do not believe I am guilty of sexual harassment, and I believe a full presentation of the facts will vindicate me.'

New York's billionaire mayor Michael Bloomberg has splashed out on a bespoke hand-made copper bath at a cost of around $13,300. Built to fit the mayor's exact specifications, French craftsmen have hand-molded the vast tub - the latest addition for his five-storey Manhattan townhouse which he is in the process of renovating. The finished piece is expected to be shipped from the town of Villedieu-les-Poeles, in Normandy, northern France, this month. Lavish: A luxurious copper bathtub, hand-molded to major Michael Bloomberg's specifications, has been built in France and is expected to be delivered to his Manhattan townhouse this month . According to news service, AFP, it took skilled workmen 250 hours to build the lavish bath tub, by molding two 2mm-thick big sheets of copper. Etienne Dulin, the owner of the 200-year-old Atelier du Cuivre (Copper Workshop), which was commissioned for the work, told AFP: 'He requested a nickel finish, to give a slightly glossier effect.' He said that the advantages of a copper bath are that it takes the temperature of the water almost immediately, meaning the water cools down slower, and he said copper also kills bacteria. Based on the man-hours required to build it, the news service estimated the cost of the bath at at least 10,000 euros ($13,300). Free-standing roll-top baths can be bought from around $500 or less. Mr Dulin said: 'These days, those who have money are looking for ways to distinguish themselves from the crowd and we are virtually alone in the world in being able to deliver this kind of quality.' Bloomberg, pictured (left) Monday during a news conference defending police stop-and-search powers, is expected to have paid at least $13,300 for his giant copper bath tub . Mr Bloomberg, who completes his 12-year stint as mayor of NYC in November, has recently come under fire from critics angry that the public-transport advocate uses two SUVs to get to work. The founder of Bloomberg LP, a financial data and media company, has previously boasted that he takes the subway almost every day. But in fact a New York Times investigation found the vehicles are waiting outside his house virtually every morning. The Chevrolet Suburbans drive him past two local subway stations and drop him 22 blocks away at an express train station that goes direct to City Hall, according to the news service.","Michael Bloomberg's new copper bath hand built by craftsmen in France .

A rodeo clown who dressed as Barack Obama and asked the crowd if they wanted to see the President 'run down by a bull' was today banned from the Missouri State Fair for life. The unnamed stuntman was widely criticized by Democratic and Republican officials after the controversial act on Saturday. The clown won't be allowed to participate or perform at the fair again and fair officials said they were also reviewing whether to take any action against the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association, the contractor responsible for the event. Numerous Missouri officials denounced the act after video and photos were posted online. Some Democratic Missouri lawmakers suggested on Monday that there should be financial consequences for the fair. Scroll down for video . Anger: A rodeo clown dressed as Obama has angered visitors to Missouri State Fair . The fair said in a written statement . announcing the clown's ban that he had engaged in an 'unconscionable . stunt' that was 'inappropriate and not in keeping with the Fair's . standards.' The fair's press release did not identify the clown. At . least one person defended him. David Berry, a Missouri Rodeo Cowboy . Association member who was at Saturday's event, described the clown as a . friend and said there was nothing offensive or unusual about his . actions. Berry said the Obama character was meant to look like a dummy . and that rodeo clowns have long performed such acts, often imitating . sitting presidents. 'The . joke is not that it was the president,' Berry said. 'They drag out this . person dressed like a dummy and all of the sudden this dummy just takes . off running. That's what's funny.' But other rodeo professionals said the Missouri fair stunt appeared to go too far. 'It's . not unheard of for a rodeo clown, depending on how he reads his . audience, to play politics a little bit,' said Jim Bainbridge, the . senior public relations coordinator at the Professional Rodeo Cowboys . Association, based in Colorado Springs, Colorado. 'But . this crossed a line. Clearly, when you're suggesting that the president . should be injured, it kind of gets to a level of hostility that is . inappropriate.' Outcry: Many people took to Twitter to condemn the rodeo act . Perry Beam, . an attendee who posted a photo of the event on Facebook, has said it . had the feeling of Ku Klux Klan rally. He said that, at one point, . another clown ran up to the one wearing the Obama mask and played with . the lips on the mask. The . rodeo's announcer — whom some media initially identified as making the . comments about Obama — sought Monday to distance himself from the . clown's actions. Announcer . Mark Ficken said through an attorney that the clown was wearing a live . microphone and had given the announcer no advance notice about the skit. Ficken is president of the Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association and also . is superintendent of the Boonville School District. 'He . was as surprised as anyone with the appearance of an Obama-masked rodeo . clown,' said Ficken's attorney, Albert Watkins of St. Louis. Watkins . said Ficken's only comment during the event was to say, 'Watch out for . that bull Obama!' Watkins said that was meant as a warning for the . clown's safety. Fair . Marketing Director Tammie Nichols said the rodeo clown was hired by . Missouri Rodeo Cowboy Association and that fair officials did not know . he was going to mock Obama. 'We've . worked with this company for many, many, many years. We have a . longstanding history with them and never had any trouble,' Nichols said. The . association did not respond to an email request from AP for an . interview on Monday and had removed the names of its officers from its . website. A statement on the site said the association's directors are . 'dealing with the situation firmly and quickly as this type of behavior . will not be tolerated.' Most . of the Missouri State Fair's roughly $4.5 million budget comes from . fees charged to attendees and vendors, but it receives about $558,000 . from tax revenues, according to the state budget office. Missouri . House Democrats have suggested the Republican-led chamber should form a . special committee to investigate the incident and determine whether to . continue providing tax dollars to the fair. State . Republican Steve Webb, chairman of the Missouri Legislative Black . Caucus, said Democratic Governor Jay Nixon should cancel the governor's . annual ham breakfast scheduled for Thursday at the fairgrounds. But . Nixon spokesman Scott Holste said the governor did not plan to cancel . the breakfast because of the 'deplorable actions that took place during . this one event.' The stunt on Saturday raised fresh concerns about how ridiculing President Obama is nothing more than thinly veiled racism. One . of the other rodeo clowns wobbled the lips of the Obama mask, and the . man wearing it was forced to run after a bull gave chase, according to a . man who witnessed the event. Boycott: The stunt led to some families and politicians saying they will stop visiting the fair . A . couple who had taken a foreign exchange student to the fair to show . them American life said they left in disgust after seeing the offensive . stunt, according to the Kansas City Star. Senator Claire McCaskill called the event shameful and unacceptable, according to CBS St Louis. 'The . young Missourians who witnessed this stunt learned exactly the wrong . lesson about political discourse - that somehow it’s ever acceptable to, . in a public event, disrespect, taunt, and joke about harming the . President of our great nation,' Ms McCaskill said. The Jackson County Democratic Party also issued a statement that called the rodeo 'a show as ugly as any you could see.' 'Encouraging . physical harm to the President, whatever the party, is not acceptable . and should not be tolerated,' the statement read. Anti-Obama sentiment is high in rural Missouri, where the President lost 60-40 per cent to Mitt Romney in the 2012 election. However, the rodeo clown dressed as .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 06:45 EST, 13 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 17:20 EST, 13 August 2013 . Two priceless medieval panels depicting saints  have been stolen from a remote church. A third was damaged when thieves cut the artworks from a choir screen at 15th-century Holy Trinity church in  Torbryan, Devon. The panels are as rare as a Turner or Rembrandt, said an expert, who feared they may have been stolen to order. Examination: Dr Neil Rushton, from the Churches Conservation Trust, examines the remaining damaged panels and the gaping hole left following the theft . 'Priceless': Two mid-15th Century panels depicting medieval saints were stolen from the church in Devon . The painted panels which depicted St Victor of Marseilles and St Margaret before they were stolen . ‘Paintings of God, Mary and the . Apostles are two a penny in English churches, which is why it is . possible these thieves targeted lesser saints as they are much rarer,’ said Dr Neil Rushton, an arts historian with the Churches Conservation . Trust. ‘This is the best example of this type . of medieval art in this country. They are as unique and priceless as a . Turner or a Rembrandt and are irreplaceable. They are intrinsic to this . building and the theft devalues the whole church.’ The panels, about 18in by 6in,  were . part of a series of 40 depicting God, Mary, the Apostles and other . saints set in a rood or choir screen that was a common feature in . medieval church architecture. Investigation: Thieves used a knife to rip out the panels, leaving a hole in the screen and damaging a third artwork in the process . The damage where the panels were ripped free after thieves used knives to cut them loose . Dr Neil Rushton: The paintings are intrinsic to this building and the theft devalues the whole church' Those stolen featured St Victor of . Marseilles and St Margaret of Antioch, while the one that was left . damaged pictured a female saint. The panels were once whitewashed   to . protect them from the puritanical zeal of the Reformation, when many of . the intricate screens, especially those that included representations of . saints, were taken down. 'Rare': The panels belonged to one section of the screen that spans the aisles of the historic church . Dr Rushton said the panels were of . ‘cathedral quality’. ‘They have been painted by a specially commissioned . artist who would have been a top artist of his day,’ he added. ‘They are contemporary to when the . church was built. It shows  there was a lot of money around here at the . time, mostly from the  wool trade. Historic: The 15th Century church deep in the Devon countryside was targeted by thieves in a 'devastating' blow . ‘Unless the damage to one panel was an . accident, it is difficult to understand why those who did it bashed it . when they did such a delicate job of removing the other two.’ Experts believe the paintings may have been stolen due to their rarity. The panels have been described as 'the best example of this type of panels in this country' and 'as unique and priceless as a Turner or a Rembrandt'. The panels in the pre-Reformation church have survived 'exceptionally' well from the late medieval period and feature lesser saints, making them much rarer than paintings of God, Mary and the apostles. It is also believed the artist was specially commissioned to produce the panels for the screens due to the 'very high status' of the artistry involved. The church itself was built in the 15th century and is designated by English Heritage as a Grade 1 listed building. A number of other panels have been . stolen in the past but Crispin Truman, the chief executive of the . Churches Conservation Trust  charity, said the Torbryan screen remained . ‘probably the best  preserved medieval rood screen in the country’. ‘They are fantastic examples of . craftsmanship of the time,’ he said. ‘The value of these panels is in . the building, they belong there.’ Holy Trinity is open to the public and . still hosts services. Dr Rushton admitted that it would not have been . difficult for the thieves to carry out the crime because of the trust’s . policy of trying to keep churches open. ‘We do not want locked doors and people turning up and not being able to get in,’ he said. ‘But we take a risk if someone’s determined enough they are going to come in and steal.’ While acknowledging that the panels . were essentially priceless because of their rarity. He added: ‘Someone . may pay a lot of money for them or they may be sold at a car boot sale . for ten quid – we really don’t know.’","Panels featured paintings of saints by 'high-status' artists .

An 11-year-old boy was fighting for his life today after being seriously injured when a light aircraft crashed in the grounds of an Elizabethan manor house while apparently attempting a loop-the-loop. It came down near Canons Ashby House in Northamptonshire and the boy - a passenger - was airlifted to Birmingham Children’s Hospital while the pilot was taken to University Hospital Coventry. The plane plummeted 100ft when the pilot, believed to be the boy’s father, lost control of it and crashed into the grounds of the Grade 1 listed National Trust property at around 11:45am. Wreckage: Rescuers at the scene of a light aircraft crash where an 11-year-old boy was seriously injured.

Emergency workers: The plane plummeted 100ft when the pilot, believed to be the boy¿s father, lost control of it and crashed into the grounds of the Grade 1 listed National Trust property at around 11:45am . Eyewitnesses reported seeing the De Havilland DH.60 Gipsy Moth attempting a loop-the-loop moments before the engine ‘cut out’ at the top of the climb. Ben Nichols, 19, who lives at nearby Lodge Farm in the village, saw the plane spiral to the ground with sister Zara, 20. ‘We were working the sheep at the time,’ said Mr Nichols. ‘Then we saw this two-seater biplane, it was whirling around a bit, looked like it tried to do a loop. Then the engine cut out. ‘It spiralled down a bit, regained a bit of control and landed with a thud.’ Response: Eyewitnesses reported seeing the plane attempting a loop-the-loop moments before the engine 'cut out' at the top of the climb .

Police were last night hunting Paul Flint after he went on the run for a second time in the space of 13 months . A convicted murderer has gone on the run from jail for a second time and is suspected of carrying out a string of burglaries. Police were last night hunting Paul Flint, who once killed a man while breaking into a house. It is the latest in a string of cases of dangerous inmates walking out of low-security jails. Flint, 48, who was jailed for murder and burglary in 1990, failed to return to Hollesley Bay prison, Suffolk, in June last year after being released temporarily. He was arrested five days later in Bristol by police using a Taser. On July 1 this year he walked out of Ford Prison in West Sussex. Detectives believe he may have since committed at least three burglaries in nearby Brighton and Hove during which more than £2,500 and a laptop were stolen. They said the 5ft 11in killer, who is black, bespectacled and stocky, should not be approached. He was found guilty of the murder of John McTurk after attacking him during a burglary in Islington, North London, in 1989. Last weekend, murderer Daniel Rosenthal, who has paranoid schizophrenia, disappeared after being allowed to go on an unsupervised walk around the gardens at low-security Southfield Hospital in Totton, Hampshire. The 58-year-old, who was jailed for murder after chopping his mother to pieces in 1981, was not found for almost 24 hours. Last month, violent robber Mark Donnison, 43, escaped from Hollesley Bay, after being sentenced for absconding from North Sea Camp open prison, Lincolnshire, in August 2012. A Ministry of Justice spokesman said: ‘We are committed to ensuring risk to the public is minimised. All those in open conditions have been categorised as being low risk to the public.’ Flint walked out of Ford Prison, in West Sussex, on July 1 this year .","Paul Flint was jailed in 1990 for the murder of John McTurk .

The number of prescriptions for diabetes drugs has soared by more than half to a record 42.5 million in less than a decade. Official figures reveal a 57 per cent rise from 27.1 million in only seven years in England. In the same period, the cost of the medicines increased by nearly half from £514million to £764.1 million last year. The number of prescriptions for diabetes drugs has soared by more than half to a record 42.5 million in less than a decade . This is costing the Health Service an extra £250 million a year to treat the country’s 3 million diabetics. The report from the Health and Social Care Information Centre said the rise in prescriptions and bills is driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes. Other factors include greater use of newer and more costly medicines. Experts believe another 850,000 people are unaware they have the condition. However, increasing numbers have been identified since the start of a system rewarding GPs financially for diagnosing and treating patients. Items for diabetes now account for 9.3 per cent of the total cost of prescribing in the NHS and 4.3 per cent of all items. The report from the Health and Social Care Information Centre said the rise in prescriptions and bills is driven by the increasing prevalence of diabetes . This compares with 6.6 per cent of the bill and 3.8 per cent of items in 2005-6. Simon O’Neill, director for health intelligence at the charity Diabetes UK, said more investment is needed to ensure that patients receive the right  treatment earlier. This would help cut the  estimated £8billion a year spent on treating the complications of the condition, he said. Nine out of ten of patients have type 2 diabetes, when the body cannot process blood sugar. This leads to high levels which can damage organs and lead to years of ill-health. Type 2 is strongly linked to lifestyle factors, including being overweight, eating a poor diet and not exercising enough. According to Diabetes UK, 24,000 people with diabetes in England and Wales die early each year because of the condition.","Official figures reveal a 57% rise from 27.1 min only seven years in England .

A video shot after the assault on the consulate shows people scrambling to save Stevens after he was discovered in a room of the building.

A translation provided by The New York Times shows that one of the Libyans said: 'I swear, he's dead.' Another man says: 'Bring him out, man! Bring him out,' another says. There is hope as others are heard saying: 'The man is alive. Move out of the way. Just bring him out, man. 'Move, move, he is still alive!'

A Colorado man confessed this weekend to killing two teen boys who he said were out to blackmail him using video footage of him asking them for sex. William Dean Otto, 43, pointed police to the bodies of Danny Espinosa-Gamboa and Jonathan Gonzalez, both aged 16, buried in shallow graves near the South Platte River in Northeastern Colorado. Otto told police the boys came to his house with footage of him propositioning one of them for sex. They threatened to blackmail Otto with the video and he said he shot them when, after he refused to pay them each $10,000, one of the victims brandished a butcher knife at him. Scroll down for video... Slain: William Dean Otto admits to killing Danny Espinosa-Gamboa (left) and Jonathan Gonzalez (right), both aged 16, on Friday. Otto claims the boys tried to blackmail him with video footage of the 43-year-old propositioning them for sex . Adams County Sheriff department spokesman Sergeant Terrance O'Neill told the Denver Post that Otto was arrested Sunday. When police followed his directions to the rural edges of Colorado near the Nebraska border, they found bodies. The families of Espinosa-Gamboa and Gonazalez identified the boys as the victims Monday evening. Otto apparently owns two homes in the Centenial State. He told authorities the two boys arrived at his home in unincorporated Adams County, east of Denver, early on Friday and demanded $10,000 each or else they would expose him for propositioning and inappropriately touching one of them. Scene of the crime: Otto has a home (pictured) in Adams County, Colorado, where he admits to shooting and killing the boys. He claims one of the teens threatened him with a knife . Otto said that after he refused, one of the teens procured a knife from the kitchen. When he threatened Otto with the weapon, Otto shot them both dead with a .22 caliber rifle. He said he then wrapped the bodies in blankets and plastic and drove toward his other home in the far northeast corner of the state, in Sedgwick County. At some point, he doused the corpses in gasoline and set them ablaze before burying them in shallow graves near the South Platte River. The boys were reported missing by Saturday evening. Shallow graves: Pictured is the South Platte River in Sedgwick, Colorado. Otto told police he drove the boys' bodies to the rural area, burned them, and then buried them along the remote stretch of river in the state's northeast corner . According to neighbor Rob McClary, Otto grew up in rural Sedgwick home along with a sister. The home may also have been where he first met the boys he ultimately killed. McClary said that Otto had, in recent years, hosted many parties for teenagers at the farm home. ‘They said they were related to Billy when we asked how they knew him,’ McClary told the Denver Post. A boy interviewed by 9News said Otto's Adams County home was also 'a kick back spot' for teens and that Otto would often offer them beer. McClary, who knew Otto for many years, said he was shocked by the revelations about his old neighbor, who now faces two counts of murder in the first degree. ‘He was always very nice,’ said McClary. ‘Very polite.’","William Dean Otto told police exactly where he buried Danny Gustavo Espinosa-Gamboa and Jonathan Gonzalez in a shallow grave near the South Platte River .

Yes, it's been hot and humid for the last few weeks. And, yes, it can get grimy during summer in the city (even in Chelsea!) but I prefer to look on the bright side and think hot days and nights mean hot fun.. But there is one side of this humid weather that's been getting me down. My make-up keeps sliding off! I'll start the day looking picture-perfect, but when I get home my face is shiny, my mascara has smudged around my eyes, and my lipstick has disappeared! Scroll down for video . It may be hot outside but Binky Felstead has perfected make-up that will last all day long . My make-up skills can't compete with the weather, so I've decided once again to consult cosmetics pro Daniel Sandler to find out how to bullet-proof my look. Make-up expert Daniel has beautified countless celebrity faces, creating gorgeous looks that will stand up to the heat and dazzle of mega-watt movie lights. If anyone can heat-proof and sweat-proof my make-up, Daniel can. How To Bulletproof Your Makeup . Start with a fresh, clean face. Avoid too much moisturiser as this can eat away at your make-up during the day; just lightly blend Daniel Sandler Retexturizing Face Primer all over your face. This is the most important part of the process to ensure your make-up stays put through the day, as the primer will lock your cosmetics in place and also help smooth out fine lines. Next blend Stila's Prime Pot lid primer across the eyelids to form a long-lasting base for eyeshadow. Run a navy blue eyeliner along the upper lash line. Then apply a green eyeliner to the lower waterline before smudging it . Apply Daniel Sandler Invisible Radiance Foundation onto the face, aiming for a fresh, light coverage to even out your skin tone. Now dab a touch of Daniel Sandler's Watercolour Blusher in So Pretty onto the cheeks with your fingertip, blending it into the foundation. You only need a tiny blob of this product - it's a fluid blusher and it's water-resistant, which means it has serious staying power. Alternatively, use a cream blusher and fix it in place with translucent powder. Run a navy blue eyeliner along the upper lash line. Then apply a green eyeliner to the lower waterline before smudging it with a small brush to soften the effect. Using waterproof products like the Daniel Sandler Long Lasting Waterproof Eyeliners will give your make-up that extra longevity – I’ve used the shades Blue Velvet and Green Velvet. Brush Stila Forever Your Curl mascara onto your lashes for a really long-lasting, smudge-proof result. Waterproof mascara can be tricky to remove, but a clever little make-up artist's trick is to apply ordinary mascara first then add a coat of waterproof mascara. This makes it easier to remove at the end of the evening. Define your eyebrows with Stila's Stay All Day Waterproof Brow Colour and groom them into place with a brush. Rub Daniel Sandler's Invisible Veil Powder into your hands and press it onto your face. This will fix your products in place without giving a heavily powdered feel. 17 Photo Flawless Primer . Rimmel Undercover Shadow Primer . Bourjois Radiance Reveal Healthy Mix Foundation . Revlon PhotoReady Cream Blush in Flushed . Barry M Bold Waterproof Eyeliners in Blue and Green .

And last Thursday, shareholders suffered another blow after it was reported that analysts from brokerage Stern Agee downgraded the company from 'neutral' to 'underperform'. Sam Poser, the analyst who wrote the report for Stern Agee, cited reasons for this rating as reduced earnings expectations and concerns over the senior executive leadership, according to The Daily Beast. He wrote: 'Unfortunately, it appears that those who concur with the top executives remain at the company, at the expense of numerous talented people who have left.'

Worrying: Officials in New Zealand have released a list of bizarre baby names which were put forward by parents for their children but rejected (file picture) Naming a child is one of the most difficult decisions faced by any new parents. But it appears that not all parents take the responsibility as seriously as they should. Officials in New Zealand have today released a list of baby names which were put forward by parents for their children but rejected by authorities. As reported by the Daily Telegraph, the list of 77 names shows that the parents of one child wanted to call it 'Anal'. Thankfully for the child, the Department of Internal Affairs turned down the proposed name. Other suggested names on the list included 'Lucifer', 'Mafia No Fear' and 'Queen Victoria'. One child was set to be called '.', as in 'full stop' until the authorities prevented it. Other bizarre examples show that some parents appeared to have given up on thinking of a name for their child, with names '2nd', '3rd' or 5th' all put forward. The name rejected most often was 'justice' which was turned down 62 times. Combinations on this including 'Juztice' and 'Justus' were also refused. Rules in New Zealand prevent any child being given a name which implies that they hold a official title or rank. This has resulted in the names 'Princess' and 'King' being regularly rejected. Odd: The name rejected most often in New Zealand was 'justice'. This image shows Mount Taranaki in New Zealand . In 2008, a court in the country ordered that a girl called 'Talula Does The Hula From Hawaii' should have her name changed. The judge in the case criticised parents who give their children odd names.

For years wildlife experts have wondered why the tail of a rabbit is so bright compared to the rest of the animal's fur, and now researchers from Germany may have finally solved the mystery. But Dirk . Semmann, an evolutionary biologist from the University of Göttingen, claims the bright white tuft has evolved to distract and confuse predators. He adds that because the tail moves and seems to vanish and reappear as the rabbit makes sharp turns, the predator is forced to re-focus each time, slowing the attacker down and giving the rabbit time to escape. Researchers from Germany have discovered that rabbits, pictured, whose fur is predominantly designed to camouflage them in the wild, have a contrasting bright white cottontail to distract and confuse would-be predators. Previous theories thought the rump patch evolved for mating or to warn off rivals . The domestic rabbit is a descendant of the wild European rabbit. Rabbits were introduced to Britain by the Romans who used their fur for clothes and ate their meat. The earliest known records of rabbits in Britain were recorded in the 12th Century. The European rabbit is found in the majority of Europe but has also been introduced to other countries, including New Zealand, Australia and Chile. Wild rabbits lives in grassland, on coastal cliffs and woodland. Their coat has evolved to blend in with these environments and hide it from would-be predators. Scientists previously thought the tail contrasted so drastically against its natural camouflage because it formed a key part of the rabbit's . mating ritual. Others believed it acted as a warning to rivals and other animals. Semmann told Nature.com: 'The idea first appeared when I . was running. I met this rabbit; it was always running . and turning at some point. 'That got me thinking about the problem.' Semmann asked 24 people . to play a video game that involved following a virutal rabbit as it made sharp turns left and right. One rabbit had a flashing white tail while the other did not. The players were then told to pinpoint the rabbit's location at each turn and determine which direction the animals were heading. All the 'hunters' made the correct decisions within 0.5 . seconds in both games but when the rabbit had a tail, the number of correct calls were significantly reduced. This lead Semmann to conclude that rabbits are more likely to survive when they have bright rump patches and this explains why these tails contrast against the rest of the animal's body. The research found that by focusing on the tail, a would-be predator ignores . the main body of the animal. When the rabbit then makes a sharp . turn, this focus point disappears and moves forcing the predator to re-focus on the animal. This slows the predator down and gives the rabbit vital seconds to escape. Semmann presented his findings at the Behaviour 2013 conference in Newcastle. The research found that by focusing on the tail, a chasing predator ignores the main body of the animal. When the rabbit then makes a sharp turn, this focus point disappears forcing the predator to re-focus on the animal.

At the same time the UK taxpayer is sending £1.14billion in foreign aid to the country over the five years of the Coalition. The revelation sparked a storm of protest last week, coming after UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom accused the government of ‘treason’ for sending billions in aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’ while making cuts to police and social services at home. But Ms Greening insisted the foreign aid sent to Nigeria would ‘help Nigeria progress and develop as a country’. She told BBC Radio 4: ‘I believe it is being well spent but we obviously have to make sure that we critically assess the projects underway. ‘We do expect them to invest in their country as well. The so-called space programme was in fact investment in satellites, weather satellites and for communication. ‘So actually this investment that they’re making in the so called ""space programme"" which is actually satellite technology, some of which is actually has been provided by UK companies based in Surrey, is a sensible investment and actually one that we would be expecting them to be making alongside the investment that we make.’ Space race: A Nigerian engineer at work on one of the country's satellites developed in a British laboratory . Nigeria’s space programme started in 2003 but its first satellite lost power and disappeared from orbit. It now has three in space, NigComSat-1R, NigeriaSat-2 and Nigeria-Sat X, the first to be constructed by Nigerian engineers. Although it has bought its own . satellites and launched on Russian rockets, Nigeria has built . laboratories which it hopes will produce its own space craft by 2028. The . National Space Research and Development Agency confirmed Nigerian . astronauts should be trained and ready for space travel within two . years. Big spending: Nigeria has already launched these surveillance rockets from Russia as part of its plans to join the space race . In July this . year, NASRDA’s director general, Professor Seidu Onailo Mohammed, . declared: ‘By our road map we are supposed to have astronauts prepared . by 2015. Before the end of the year, the recruitment of astronauts will . begin so that we have them handy and as soon as we get the nod we can . pick from that number.’ Critics last week asked why Britain . was, in effect, subsidising a space programme for a nation where 70 per . cent of people live below the poverty line. The £1.14billion Nigeria will receive . over the five years of the Coalition is double the £500million set . aside to prop up struggling accident and emergency departments at our . own hospitals. Backbench . Tory MP Philip Davies said it was ‘totally unjustifiable and . unaffordable’ for Britain to give this money to Nigeria, given the scale . of its ‘grandiose’ space programme. ‘We cannot go around the world saying “don’t worry, we will feed your public for you while you waste your money on all sorts of other projects”,’ he said. ‘We have got to say to these countries “you have got to spend that money on your people where it’s most needed not on some grandiose space programme”. We are against welfare dependency at home but at the same time we are encouraging welfare dependency abroad.’ The row surrounding Mr Bloom flared when he insisted that sending aid to Africa was tantamount to treason. He added: ‘How we can possibly be giving a billion pounds a month, when we’re in this sort of debt, to Bongo Bongo land is completely beyond me.’ He claimed foreign leaders frittered the money away on ‘Ray-Ban sunglasses, apartments in Paris and Ferraris’. Poverty: Millions of Nigerians are living in poverty, despite the country earning huge profits from its oil deposits . Resources: Nigeria generates millions in oil revenue every year but much of the population lives in poverty . The Department for International . Development’s budget is rising by 35 per cent in real terms by 2015. But . while aid costs are ballooning, spending on the military, the police, . border control and care homes is being slashed. Britain . is also spending about £280million a year on aid to India, another . country with its own space programme. Debate: UKIP MEP Godfrey Bloom has reignited the issue of Britain's foreign aid contributions with his infamous 'bongo bongo land' comments . Despite Nigeria having the . second-highest national income of all African countries, most of its . people still live in poverty. It is also mired in corruption. The most . modest estimates suggest between £2.5 and £5billion is stolen from the . state’s coffers every year by corrupt officials and politicians. Jonathan Isaby from the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘When budgets are tight both for families and the . Government alike, people cannot understand why ministers are sending . more and more of our hard-earned cash overseas. ‘Taxpayers . find it especially unacceptable when their money is sent abroad as aid . to developing countries which then somehow find sufficient cash to fund . the likes of a space programme. ‘It . is totally unacceptable that British taxpayers’ money is effectively . subsidising Nigeria’s efforts to send an astronaut into space.’ The . Nigerian government has not released detailed figures on how much it is . spending on its space programme, but it is thought to be hundreds of . millions of pounds a year. British aid to Nigeria will increase by 116 . per cent under the Coalition government, from £141million in 2010/11 to . £305million in 2014/15. It amounts to a total of £1.14billion over five . years. The country has also been criticised for failing to crack down on corruption. The only senior figure from Nigeria to have been prosecuted over corruption in recent years was jailed by a British court. James Ibori, the former governor of the country’s oil-rich Delta state, was sentenced to 13 years for money laundering, forgery and fraud totalling nearly £50million. He used the money to live a lavish lifestyle, buying a house in London worth £2.25million and luxury cars worth over £650,000. Last night a spokesman for the Department for International Development said spending aid money in Nigeria would help cut crime and illegal immigration in Britain. ‘No UK aid money goes through the Nigerian government,’ she said. ‘Our investment goes into specific health, education and poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria is home to a quarter of the poorest people in Africa, and supporting their development will benefit our own trade and security.’","International Development Secretary Justine Greening defends aid cash .

Working away from home can be lonely, especially if you are 220 miles above Earth on the International Space Station. But Japanese designers have come up with a way to stop the astronauts from feeling isolated - the world's first talking robot astronaut. Kirobo - derived from the Japanese words for 'hope' and 'robot' - has been sent into space to keep astronaut Koichi Wakata company. Scroll down for video . Robot: Kirobo (pictured) has been sent to the International Space Station by Japanese scientists . Friend: Kirobo has been designed as a companion for astronauts to stop them from getting lonely . Mr Wakata will become the space station's first Japanese commander later this year. Although he will be joined by five flight engineers, including two Russians, two Americans and one Latvian, researchers hope that being able to talk with Kirobo in Japanese will keep his spirits up. The robot was among five tons of supplies and . machinery on a cargo rocket headed for the International Space Station which was launched into space from . an island off Japan today. Robot designer Tomotaka Takahashi, of the University of Tokyo, advertiser Dentsu and car maker Toyota worked on the robot, which will communicate with another robot on Earth while in space. He said the challenge was making sure it could move and talk where there was no gravity. 'Russia . was the first to go to outer space, the U.S. was the first to go to the . moon, we want Japan to be the first to send a robot-astronaut to space . that can communicate with humans,' said Yorichika Nishijima, the Kirobo . project manager. Lift off: The unmanned cargo rocket carrying Kirobo takes off from Tanegashima Space Center . Cargo: The rocket contains five tonnes of machinery and supplies for the International Space Station . History: The launch marked the first time a talking robot astronaut has been sent into space . Humanoid: Kirobo will act as a companion for Japanese astronaut Koichi Wakata, who will become commander of the ISS later this year . Mr Takahashi said he hopes robots like Kirobo that hold conversations will . eventually be used to assist astronauts working in space. 'When people think of robots in outer space, they tend to seek ones that do things physically,' he said. 'But I think there is something that could come from focusing on humanoid robots that focus on communication.' Because Kirobo does not need to perform physical activities, it is smaller than most robots that go into space. It is about 34cms tall and weighs about 1kg. Ahead of the launch on Saturday, Kirobo told reporters: 'One small step for me, a giant leap for robots.' Launch: The robot was sent into space on a H-2B rocket which set off at 04.48am local time . Companion: Kirobo (right) will be speak Japanese with astronaut Koichi Wakata (left) at the ISS . Japan boasts the most sophisticated robotics in the world, but because of its 'manga' culture, it tends to favour cute robots with human-like characteristics with emotional appeal. Mr Takahashi said sending a robot into space could help write a new chapter in the history of communication. 'I wish for this robot to function as a mediator between person and machine, or person and Internet and sometimes even between people,' he said. Japan has an ageing population and there is hope that in the future robots like Kirobo could be used as companions for elderly people in their homes and in nursing homes.

Researchers believe the woman who inspired the Mona Lisa painting was Lisa Gherardini Del Giocondo . A Florentine family tomb was opened up this afternoon for the first time in centuries in a bid to identify the bones of a woman who is believed to be the model in Leonardo da Vinci's Mona Lisa portrait. Researchers believe the woman who inspired the artist's 16th century painting which now hangs in the Louvre, Paris, was Lisa Gherardini Del Giocondo, a merchant's wife who lived across the street from de Vinci. Last year, a tomb in a former St Ursula convent in Florence was opened and several skeletons found. Experts reckon the skeletons there could be the remains of Gherardini. In a bid to correctly identify the woman, samples will now be taken from the Gherardini family tomb in the Martyrs' Crypt in Santissima Annunziata basilica where her husband and two sons are buried. A round hole was cut in the stone floor just big enough for a person to wriggle through. Speaking at the crypt today, geologist Antonio Moretti said the remains had an inscribed stone indicating they belonged to the family of Lisa Gherardini's husband and sons. Scroll down for video . Silvano Vinceti (centre), head of Italy's National Committee for the Promotion of Historic and Cultural Heritage, looks on as researchers open the tomb in the stone church floor above the family crypt of Florentine silk merchant Francesco del Giocondo - Lisa's husband - at the Santissima Annunziata basilica in Florence today .

'The carbon-14 test will tell us which of the three dates back to the 1500s. 'Only then will we know which skeleton to do the final DNA test on.' It is believed Lisa's husband Francesco Del Giocondo commissioned the portrait to celebrate either Lisa's pregnancy or the purchase of a house around 1502 and 1503.

She died in 1542 at the age of 63 and was said to be buried near . the convent's altar. This type of burial was common which is why researchers are carrying out a number of tests to check they have the right bones. If the team think they have a positive match, Vinceti plans to commission a virtual reconstruction of Lisa Gherardini's face, based on the bone structure, and compare it to Leonardo's painting. 'If we succeed, we can finally resolve three questions which have obsessed historians and art-lovers worldwide,' Vinceti said. 'Was Gherardini the model for the Mona Lisa? Or was it some other model, as some people say? Or is it just a construction of the painter's fantasy?' Leonardo is famous for the huge range of his genius, ranging from painting to sculpture to anatomy. He is known not only for paintings such as the Mona Lisa and The Last Supper but for conceiving modern machines like helicopters and tanks many centuries before they were finally built.

Gloating: Ask.fm has proudly revealed a surge in numbers since the suicide of Hannah Smith, who blamed bullies on the site . The shameless website blamed for allowing trolls to drive teenager Hannah Smith to suicide has bragged about how it has had a record number of users. The 14-year-old's father David Smith today called Ask.fm 'heartless b*******' after the Latvian-based social network exclaimed millions more had signed up since his daughter's death ten days ago. Mr Smith said it was like they were 'dancing on Hannah's grave'. The site, which David Cameron called 'vile' and demanded people boycott, tweeted yesterday: 'Ask.hits 70million registered users'. Hannah hanged herself on Friday, August 2, after anonymous bullies on the site told her to 'go die', 'drink bleach' and 'get cancer'. Her father told the Daily Mirror: ''It just proves what a heartless bunch of b******* the people that run the site are. 'It should be shut down, but instead they're boasting about the numbers of hits and members they've had - and all the while, the Government is doing nothing.' Ask.fm claimed yesterday it has 70million users, but six weeks ago it tweeted it had 60million users. Based on those figures it makes £6million a year on advertising, although last week some of Britain's biggest businesses started pulling out because of its image as a place for anonymous bullying. It came just 48 hours after the website's bosses claimed the teenager sent most of the vile abuse to herself. It was reported the social networking site insists that she set up most of the anonymous identities used to bombard her own page. A source at the firm based in Riga, Latvia, said: ‘With the Hannah case, the company have looked at every identity – the [computer] IP addresses are trackable. She posted the anonymous things herself.’Scroll down for video . Boast: The Ask.fm Twitter account rarely tweets but yesterday it revealed a huge rise in users - 10m more in six weeks . Upsetting: Hannah Smith and her father Dave when she was a baby and and as a teenager, and he said today Ask.fm were 'dancing on her grave' Ask.fm allows users to ask questions or invite them from other members but they can remain anonymous, allowing trolls to pick out victims. Mr Smith, a lorry driver from Lutterworth, Leicestershire, added that the issue was not if Hannah had sent any of the messages. ‘She was bullied online,’ he said. ‘If Hannah did do some of it herself, then it just shows how desperate she was.’ Mr Smith said Ask.fm should be working to stop the abuse instead of deflecting blame for Hannah’s death. ‘Ask.fm has information to say that Hannah was being bullied but they have not passed on that  information,’ he said. ‘They are  trying to discredit a 14-year-old girl who has committed suicide. ‘They have not once been in touch with me. Hannah has touched a lot of hearts. But they are trying to  discredit her because this company was making millions.’ Tragic Hannah, 14, from Lutterworth, .

"By . Sam Webb . PUBLISHED: . 12:15 EST, 4 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 12:35 EST, 4 August 2013 . Professor Mary Beard was sent a bomb threat on social networking site Twitter. It is the latest in a series of threats and vulgar insults she has been subjected to . Television historian Mary Beard has revealed she was sent a bomb threat on Twitter, hours after the social networking site’s UK boss personally apologised to women who have been attacked by 'trolls'. Ms Beard, a professor of classics at University of Cambridge, said she had contacted police after receiving a message last night claiming a bomb had been left outside her home. She wrote on her Twitter page: 'Just got 1 of these messages. A bomb has been placed outside your home. It will go off at exactly 10.47pm and destroy everything. Told police.' She later wrote: 'OK all, it’s 11.00pm and we are still here. So unless the trolling bombers timekeeping is rotten.... all is well. But how stupidly nasty.' The writer is among a number of prominent women who have been subjected to a stream of vile abuse and threats on Twitter. Guardian columnist Hadley Freeman, Independent columnist Grace Dent and Europe editor of Time magazine Catherine Mayer, as well as a number of other women, have previously said they had been the subject of bomb threats on the site, while two received threats of rape. In separate incidents, Labour MP Stella Creasy and campaigner Caroline Criado-Perez, who successfully fought for a woman’s face to appear on £10 banknotes, were also threatened on Twitter with rape. Two arrests have already been made in relation to those threats. Professor Beard, 58, told BBC Radio Five Live: 'There’s something very strangely and awkwardly insidious about it. 'It is is scary and it has got to stop. I didn’t actually intellectually feel that I was in danger but I thought I was being harassed, and and I thought I was being harassed in a particularly unpleasant way.' Tony Wang, Twitter UK general manager, posted a series of tweets yesterday saying abuse was 'simply not acceptable'. The TV classicist informed her followers of the violent threat . Sickening: She called the hollow threat 'stupidly nasty' The professor also tweeted about her struggle to report the threat to the website's administrators . His messages came after the website clarified its rules on abusive behaviour amid a growing backlash over a series of attacks. Mr Wang wrote: 'I personally apologise to the women who have experienced abuse on Twitter and for what they have gone through. 'The abuse they’ve received is simply not acceptable. It’s not acceptable in the real world, and it’s not acceptable on Twitter. 'There is more we can and will be doing to protect our users against abuse. That is our commitment.' The company has updated its rules to make it clear that abuse will not be tolerated and has put extra staff in place to handle reports of abuse, it said. The move comes as Scotland Yard said its e-crime unit was investigating allegations by eight people of abuse on the microblogging site. UK twitter boss Tony Wang says Twitter is taking the issue seriously and apologised to those who have suffered abuse . An online petition calling for Twitter to add a 'report abuse' button to tweets has already attracted more than 124,000 signatures. An 'in-tweet' report button has been added so people can report abusive behaviour directly from a tweet, Twitter said. The anonymous Twitter accounts from which the bomb threats originated were suspended, although screen grabs were widely circulated online. Scotland Yard said an investigation into eight allegations had been launched. The force said: 'Detectives from the Specialist Organised & Economic Crime Command have taken responsibility for the investigations into a number of allegations recently made to the MPS relating to allegations of malicious communication made on the social networking site Twitter. 'The Police Central e-Crime Unit (PCeU), who hold the police national cyber crime remit, is now investigating allegations made by eight people that they have been subject to harassment, malicious communication or bomb threats.' It said the decision was taken to centralise the individual investigations, including three from outside London. Many are taking part in a one-day boycott of Twitter to put pressure on the site to take more effective to prevent online abuse and threats. The hashtag #twittersilence has been trending all day and some of the celebrities supporting it are Thick Of It actor and comedian Chris Addison, magician Derren Brown, comedian Sarah Millican and TV presenter Kirstie Allsop. Journalist and author Caitlin Moran promoted the boycott, saying: 'I’m pro the mooted 24-hour walk-out on 4th of August, because not only is it a symbolic act of solidarity – which are my favourite kinds of symbolic acts – but because it will also focus minds at Twitter to come up with their own solution to the abuses of their private company.' However, some have called the boycott 'pointless'. Others said the best way to prevent online abuse is to name and shame offenders. Twitter user Caileigh Scott said: 'Silence is what oppressors and abusers want from their victims. 'Make noise, not #twittersilence. Be heard.'","TV historian has been subjected to a stream of online abuse .

The Olympian was spotted kayaking by Bronwin du Plessis, 25, who was walking with his wife around the Old Harbour. He said: 'He was standing next to a kayak with three of his friends and I saw the prosthetic legs. I looked up and I thought 'oh, it's Pistorius'. 'I had my camera with me so I quickly took a few photographs. It was totally by chance. 'Then they started carrying out the kayak and he was up in front with a friend at the back and then there was another two friends in another kayak. 'He looked relaxed, he wasn't looking over his shoulder - he was just like a normal person. 'You wouldn't think it was the same person you saw in the courtroom.'

Mr du Plessis said there were about a dozen other people around at the time but that none 'paid much attention' to Pistorius. He said this could have been because of his longer hair style - even though he kept his prosthetic legs on the whole time. 'He looked like a totally different person,' added Mr du Plessis, who described the moment as 'surreal'. Pistorius has been living with his uncle since being bailed by Pretoria Magistrates Court. According to Beeld, Pistorius' uncle Arnold Pistorius said the athlete was in Hermanus visiting a family friend's mother - who is terminally ill.

His family, and those close to him, have encouraged him to spend a few hours a week on the track to assist him in finding the necessary mental and emotional equilibrium to process his trauma and prepare for the trial.' The athlete was 'overcome with emotion' when he pulled on his carbon fibre running blades for his first track training since Ms Steenkamp's death, his agent Peet van Zyl said, adding that Pistorius described his return to the track as 'bittersweet'. Ms Steenkamp's parents previously said they are still searching for answers. In a television interview in June, June Steenkamp said: 'There is only one person who knows what happened' on the night her daughter was killed.'

In an age where women are liberated, have choices and careers and (better) economic equality, why are we still putting up with men behaving badly? What’s with Kim Kardashian putting up with new dad Kanye’s blatant unavailability - both emotional and physical - when he should be beaming by her side, being proud and protective. Rihanna giving Chris Brown a zillion second chances when she has visual evidence - her smashed up face - of what ‘love’ means to him. What's with Kim Kardashian putting up with new Dad Kanye's blatant unavailability? Simon Cowell’s mini-tribe of exes all sobbing that they should have been the one to father his love child. Why exactly? Yes, I get the yacht/jet/diamond appeal but seriously, who really wants to spend their life with a man who collects their exes rather than puts them in the past, where exes are supposed to be. Why is Cara Delevingne sniffing around Kate Moss’s ex Pete Doherty? What am I missing? Yes, we should all be entitled to make and learn from our mistakes but what message is this sending teenage girls, who we know are obsessed with celebrity? Simon Cowell's mini-tribe of exes all sobbing that they should have been the one to father his love child. Why exactly? What’s wrong with going for the nice guy? Women have always been brainwashed into the appeal of the ‘bad boy’. The drama of it all is seen as exciting. There’s the ‘hot’ make-up sex after the fights; the heady rebellion of going for someone who only thinks about now, doesn’t care about the future. When you’re 18 and tentatively exploring life and sex and relationships, this can be appealing. But as an adult, who can be bothered with the reality of dating a guy who’s never on time (if he bothers turning up at all), who has no money, drug or alcohol problems, an inability to plan ahead, an allergic reaction to a mere whiff of commitment, no real goals or ambition and loathes your friends and family (but not half as much as they loathe him). My definition of a bad guy is this: it’s someone who doesn’t treat you nicely. The stereotype that nice equals weak is false. Studies show nice people are not necessarily less assertive or competitive than ‘difficult’ people. Tracey says women have been 'brainwashed' into liking bad boys and that nice doesn't equal boring . ‘Nice is boring’ also doesn’t stand up to scrutiny. Unless ‘boring’ means calling when they’re supposed to and being where they’re supposed to be, with the person they’re supposed to be with. ‘Nice is average looking’ is shot to smithereens by Jon Hamm topping Sexiest Man Alive polls worldwide and also being a nice guy. ‘Nice’ isn’t just an throwaway word by the way: it’s measurable. Psychologists define nice people as those who score high on a personality trait called agreeableness. If you’re nice, your over-riding concern is having happy, positive relationships with other people. You like harmony and you don’t like upsetting people. Nice people are generous, trustworthy, reliable and considerate. They don’t play games because they don’t like to make other people feel uncomfortable. The ability to be able to ‘put yourself in someone else’s shoes’ or ‘see how your partner sees’ is a hugely positive factor in relationships. This is the automatic default for the average nice guy. Studies show agreeable people also stay married longer, are more intimate in their marriages, have better relationships with their kids and - not surprisingly - are more satisfied with their lives overall. Case closed for any female who has even a hint of intelligence and high self-esteem.

A teenage girl's ashes were tossed into the street by thieves after they found them in her mother's truck. The ashes of Emma Ransom had been kept in a velvet pouch by her mother since the 19-year-old's death in 2009. Culprits apparently tipped the ashes out of the pouch onto the pavement when they found them in a truck during a series of vehicle break-ins in Calgary, Canada, on August 2. Precious: Emma Ransom, 19, was killed in a car crash in 2009 - since then her mother had kept her ashes close to her in a velvet bag . A green jacket . that belonged to Emma was also taken. Emma was killed along with two other women when the car they were driving in 2009 near Nanton, Alberta, slammed into an oncoming car. Ransom was barely able to hold back tears yesterday as she discussed losing her daughter for a second time. 'The first thing I looked for were my daughter's ashes, and they were gone,' she said. 'The policeman found the little pouch in the middle of the road and it was empty, so we went down to the corner and found the pile of ashes there. Grief: Colleen Ransom tried to salvage as many of her daughter's ashes as she could from the rain-soaked street . Robbed: Thieves found the bag containing the ashes in Mrs Ransom's truck . Spree: Several other vehicles were stolen from the area of Calgary on the same day . 'It had been raining, they were wet and we couldn't scoop them. 'We got a few anyways.' Ransom, who tightly clasped a large picture of her smiling daughter, said she always kept her close by. 'Anybody who has lost someone knows how precious it can be. They were the only things I have left of my daughter and I like her to come with me wherever I go,' she said. 'I thought, who would do that? Who would take the ashes and dump them? And then I realised they probably didn't know they were my daughter's ashes.' The few remaining ashes are now safely in her home. Ransom said in future she plans to take her daughter's ashes with her, but will keep them in her purse. Ransom said the pain of the loss of her daughter hasn't eased over the past four years. 'It never goes away. She's always there. I wake up … I think about her. I think about her constantly.'

All three were very petite and one of them might be named Sarah, police said. One was blond, one had brown hair and the third had black hair.

The home of Erica Lynn Parsons' adoptive parents in Salisbury, North Carolina is being searched today as the FBI join the hunt to find the 15-year-old who went missing two years ago. Her parents Sandy and Casey Parsons said that she went to live with her biological grandmother in Asheville  two years ago, but authorities say that isn't true. Erica was officially reported missing July 30 by her 19-year-old adoptive brother. She was last seen in November 2011, then 13-years-old. The search is on: Authorities are searching the home of Erica Lynn Parsons' adoptive parents after she was just reported missing July 30. She was last seen in November 2011 . Where is she? Erica was reported missing by her older brother nearly two years after she disappeared from her Salisbury, North Carolina home . Last sighting: Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011, when she left her adoptive parents' home on Miller Chapel Road in Salisbury . Rowan County Sheriff's Office spokesman John Sifford confirmed the search, but said it was standard with such a case. He said people shouldn't read too much into it. Without a trace: Erica Lynn Parsons, 15, was reported missing by her 19-year-old brother July 30 after she was last seen in Salisbury, North Carolina, in November 2011 . The couple has hired an attorney. They spoke with reporters last week, saying they wanted to give their side of the story. An attorney hired by Erica's adoptive parents, Casey and Sandy Parsons, claimed that his clients were under the impression that the 15-year-old went to live with her biological grandmother and wanted to be left alone, the Charlotte Observer reported. The lawyer, Carlyle Sherrill, said that two years ago, a person claiming to be a relative or friend of Erica's birth parents came by Parsons' home on Miller Chapel Road to pick her up and take her to her family. The adoptive parents said they did not raise an alarm at the time because Erica visited that person in Asheville on several occasions. According to Sherrill, In February 2012, Erica called the Parsonses and informed them in no uncertain terms that she was not coming back because she did not want to live with them anymore, Asheville Citizen-Times reported. ‘They looked at it as being a rebellious teenager. That was an attitude they took,’ Sherrill said. ‘I don't know that at any time it dawned on them she was a missing person.’ According to police investigating the case, when they questioned Casey and Sandy Parsons over a two-day period last week, the parents lied to them and were uncooperative. 'Rebellious teen:' Erica, who was adopted by the Parsons family when she was 2 weeks old, allegedly informed them by phone that she does not want to return home and plans to stay with her birth parents' relatives . Their attorney, however, insists that his clients did not purposefully fabricate anything, but were rather relaying information that they believed to be true. Sherrill added that her clients stopped answering questions when detectives began insinuating that that the Parsonses may have played a role in their adopted daughters' disappearance. On Friday, Erica's adoptive aunt and grandmother were interviewed by investigators. Meanwhile, the Parsonses spoke to local reporters, saying that they believed the 15-year-old was OK, but afraid to contact them due to all the media attention. 1998: Erica Lynn Parsons, age 2 weeks, is taken in by Casey and Sandy Parsons, who have three children of their own. She is the biological child of Sandy Parsons’ brother’s wife. 2000: The Parsonses officially adopt Erica in Cabarrus County . 1999-2011: The couple have two more children, Brooke and Toby. February 2010: William James Parsons, 16, the couple’s biological son, is arrested for biting his younger brother. August 2011: James Parsons is charged with two counts of assault, animal cruelty and assault on a minor. Charges are dismissed when Casey Parsons does not appear in court. Nov. 19, 2011: The Parsonses take Erica to a McDonald’s in Mooresville to catch a ride to the Asheville home of her biological grandmother, Irene 'Nan' Goodman. December 2011: The Parsonses say on her third visit to Asheville, Erica calls home and says she doesn’t want to live with them anymore. 2012: Casey Parsons files a missing persons report for her daughter, Brooke. July 30, 2013: After his parents kick him out, James Parsons contacts the Rowan County Sheriff’s Office and reports that Erica has been missing for two years. August 2013: After undergoing two days of questioning by investigators, the Parsonses hire attorney Carlyle Sherrill. Aug. 5, 2013: The Rowan Sheriff’s Office issues a missing/endangered persons alert for Erica. Aug. 9, 2013: The Parsonses have agreed to appear on the Dr. Phil Show. Source: Salisbury Post . Casey and Sandy Parsons told the press that despite accusations from police, they have done nothing wrong. ‘[Police said] we had killed Erica and buried her in our backyard,’ Casey Parsons said. ‘We told them ""Go do what you want to the house. Look. Go dig the yard up. Erica is not in this yard. Erica is fine.""' According to the couple, they believed that their adopted daughter has been living with her biological grandmother, Irene Goodman, since December 2011, when the girl traveled to Asheville to visit her for Christmas. However, police and Erica's birth mother, Carolyn Parsons, said that the teen's paternal grandmother has died. Despite Casey and Sandy Parsons' protestations that they have never hurt Erica, the Department of Social Services has removed their two other children from their home and launched an investigation of its own. According to DSS documents obtained by Channel 9, at least one person had been concerned that Erica was being abused as a child. The report stated that when Erica was 4-years-old, she was observed with ‘four marks on her rear end, a long one down the back of her leg and a couple on the side of her face.' According to a woman involved in the case, the little girl was perpetually punished by her adoptive parents. The person who raised the alarm about Erica's treatment told DSS at the time that Casey Parsons even carried ‘a belt’ and used it to whip the girl. However, a DSS investigation into the allegations of abuse has yielded no evidence. According to a report summing up the investigation, ‘no signs of cuts, contusions, or scratches’ have been found,  and Erica showed ‘no signs of fear with either of the parents going up and sitting on each of their laps without being asked.’ The person who reported the abuse, however, insisted that Erica was very submissive and would do whatever she was told out of fear of being punished. The Parsonses' lawyer told ABCNews.com that around November 2011, Case and Sandy Parsons got a call from Erica's birth mother, who said she wanted her daughter to come stay with her and another relative in the Asheville area for a while. Erica has been missing since November 19, 2011. On July 30, nearly two years later, her older brother, James Parsons, reported her missing. He told authorities that when he asked about his sister previously, his parents said she had left and moved in with other relatives, the Salisbury Post said. Claims of innocence: Casey and Sandy Parsons gave an interview to local media in which they insisted that they have done nothing to harm Erica, and that they believed she has been living with her grandmother . The 19-year-old said he fears that something may have happened to Erica and his parents are not telling him. According . to Sherrill, James Parsons called police after being forced to move out . of his parents’ house as punishment for assaulting his mother with a . baseball bat in June. Casey and Sandy Parsons described . their son as an emotionally disturbed young man who is bi-polar, . suicidal and at times violent. In February 2010, James was charged with assaulting his then-3-year-old brother, Toby, by biting the toddler on the arm. That . summer, James was charged with assaulting his mother, who had just . undergone surgery, his sister and brother, and also choking the sister’s . dog. According to the . arrest warrant, the teen pulled his mother’s gastrointestinal bag tube, . causing it to bleed, and kicking the woman while she was on the floor. James also allegedly threated his baby bother with a knife and grabbed . his sister, Brooke, by the throat. The charges against James Parsons were later dropped because his mother failed to appear on court. Vendetta: The parents accused their son, James, of filing the missing persons report just to get back at them for forcing him out of the house after he had attacked his mother . Worst fears: The girl's adoptive grandparents, Janet and Steven Parsons, . are afraid that something happened to Erica, and their son, Erica's . father, and his wife are not telling them the truth . ‘He . always told me he was going to get me. I never thought he’d do this,’ Casey Parsons said, implying that her son filed the missing person’s . report to get back at her. Last . year, authorities said Casey Parsons reported her daughter Brooke . missing, but the child was later found and returned home. When the Parsonses, who adopted the girl when she was just 2-weeks-old, tried to contact Erica's family in Asheville, they could not be found. The parents have agreed to speak out . about their adopted daughter on the Dr. Phil talk show, . hoping it will help investigators find Erica. Relatives told Channel 9 the girl has had a life filled with pain and fear. According to one family member, Erica could not speak to or look at anyone because she was always being punished and abused. Erica Parsons is described as 4 feet 5 . and weighing between 85 and 90lbs. She has brown hair and brown eyes and . appears small for her age.","Erica Lynn Parsons, 15, last seen November 19, 2011, leaving adoptive parents' home in Salisbury, North Carolina .

Gloria Bullard, 87, stood in Times Square, just like she did as thousands celebrated the end of World War II that day in 1945, and let herself be swept off her feet. The stage was set under a giant video projection of the famous photo, 67 years after V J Day became one of the greatest moments for the Greatest Generation. Re-joicing: Gloria Bullard is seen smiling as she re-enacts the famous Victory over Japay Day kiss from 1945, a photo she appeared in as a young nursing student. Her gentleman caller is WWII fighter pilot Jerry Yellin . The iconic photo of a nurse and a soldier in a the middle of a jubilant kiss as New Yorkers took to cheer on the Allied victory is actually two photos. Perhaps the most well-known was taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt and shows the couple kissing head on. It’s the version that appeared in TIME magazine’s end of the war issue. The other shot, of the very same moment, was taken by Victor Jorgensen a shows the kissing couple from the side, with more of the Times Square crowd in the background. Among the onlookers watching what would become one of history’s most famous kisses was nursing student Gloria Bullard, then known as Gloria Delaney. She’s taking a peek at the smoochers, as seen at the photos far back at left. 'It was so exciting': There, at the far left, Bullard's head peeks out, smiling, from the crowd . ‘We decided to walk over to Eighth Avenue to take the bus home,’ Mrs. Bullard said in a New York Times interview she gave in 2010. ‘That’s when we got caught in Times Square.’ Bullard was let out of class at New York Medical College, then at 105th Street, to join in the festivities—all while still wearing their starched, white uniforms. ‘That was a no-no, but who cares that day,’ Mrs. Bullard said. ‘We didn’t want to lose any time at all.’ Bullard, then doing her part to fill-in for nurses who were enlisted in the war effort, has now pitched to help memorialize the Greatest Generation’s most momentous day. Memorial: To commemorate the historic moment and the day it has come to represent, a jumbo screen of the photo, comprised of smaller shots of couples from the day has been lit for 24 hours on the 67th anniversary VJ Day . Iconic shots: The famous Time Square photo commonly thought of is actually two photos. This one, taken by Alfred Eisenstaedt and the one in which Bullard appears, which was taken by Victor Jorgensen . Under a sign that was erected in Times Square for the 67th anniversary, Bullard was held in the steady arms of World War II fighter pilot Jerry Yellin on Wednesday. Above them, innumerable photos of couples who met during the war years are projected in such a way as to come together and form the legendary photograph. Both then and now, Bullard is all smiles and she still remembers the day fondly. ‘It was so exciting,’ Mrs. Bullard said. ‘Horns, church bells, all kinds of noises.’ Unfortunately, the woman who claimed for years to be the nurse being kissed in the photo, Edith Shain, died in 2010. So Bullard’s account is the best that remains. But she says Shain was enjoying herself, too. ‘It looked to me like she was trying to keep her skirt down. I got the impression she was enjoying it.’ Greatest generation: Bullard remembers the moment fondly and says the nurse being kissed, long claimed to be the late Edith Shain, enjoyed it too. 'I got the impression she was enjoying it,' Bullard says .","A giant version of the 1940s photo was projected on Times Square jumbo screens .

British scientists have achieved a ‘profound’ breakthrough in the fight against cancer that could lead to new treatments and possibly even its prevention. They have unlocked the DNA secrets of 30 of the most common forms of the disease, bringing us closer to understanding their causes. Despite significant advances in medicine, remarkably little is known about what triggers cancer, which kills half the 325,000 Britons diagnosed with it each year. Researchers have unlocked the DNA secrets of 30 of the most common cancers, bringing us closer to understanding their underlying causes.

For instance, if something we eat is . shown to cause mutations, people could be told to avoid it in the same . way as they are advised to quit smoking to cut the odds of developing . lung cancer and wear sunscreen to protect themselves against skin . cancer.

The CDC says it costs more than $223.5billion a year . A shocking new government study claims that excessive drinking costs the nation more than $223.5billion a year in health care, lost productivity, crime and early death - and most of the burden is carried by taxpayers. The research, released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control, finds that binge drinking, alcoholism and alcohol abuse is dragging millions - and sometimes billions - of dollars from the economies of every state in the country. The health and productivity losses mean that for every cocktail, pint of beer or glass of wine consumed, American society must pay nearly $2 in additional costs. The nation's capital, which has one of the highest rates of alcohol consumption in the country according to CDC figures, pays the most. Washington DC residents consumed more than 680 drinks each in 2006 - the year that the study surveyed. Those drinks cost out more than $966billion in ancillary healthcare bills and productivity losses as a result - more than $1,660 per resident of the city. Utah, where strong influence from the Mormon church means alcohol is heavily regulated, has the lowest rates of alcohol consumption and - as a result - the lowest costs. Utah residents consumed fewer than 200 drinks each in 2006 and paid just $578 per capita. The shocking figure of $223.5billion is larger than the economies of Ireland and Pakistan. Researchers say it should serve as a wake-up call that the country needs to curb its drinking habit. 'Excessive alcohol use has devastating impacts on individuals, families, communities, and the economy,' CDC Director Dr Tom Frieden said in a statement. 'In addition to injury, illness, disease, and death, it costs our society billions of dollars through reduced work productivity, increased criminal justice expenses, and higher healthcare costs. 'Effective prevention programs can support people in making wise choices about drinking alcohol.' About 42 percent of the cost of heavy drinking was paid by state or federal funds - whether through Medicare and Medicaid or by  other government services. That amounted to the largest share of the cost - and less than the cost paid by heavy drinkers and their families. Some 70percent of the costs of excessive alcohol use was incurred by binge drinkers - those who consume five or more drinks in a single sitting. Binge drinkers account for an estimated 70percent of the cost of alcohol abuse in America, the CDC study found . Authors of the study cautioned that the data doesn't include drinkers whose productivity at work is hampered by hangovers. A MailOnline analysis of CDC data shows that New Hampshire had the highest rates of alcohol consumption, with 736 drinks purchased per capita in 2006. Washington, DC, and Nevada were the next highest.

A former Kentucky official has shot his much younger ex-lover and killed her father and brother in their home before shooting himself dead at his own father's graveside. Raymond Curtis Smith, 51, a former Knox County judge executive who later served time in federal prison for fraud, shot and wounded 21-year-old Robin Smith in the bedroom of her Pineville, Kentucky home on Tuesday morning, police said. Trooper Shane Jacobs told CNN that the pair had recently ended a relationship. Despite their names, they are not related. Robin's brother, 21-year-old Mychael Dustin . Smith, and her father, 50-year-old Michael Smith, were both killed at . the home. Each victim had been shot once. Victims: Michael Smith, left, and his son Dustin, right, were killed and Robin Smith, center, was critically wounded when Robin's former love opened fire on them at their home on Tuesday morning .

Raymond Smith then fled the scene and drove ten miles away to Hammons Fork Cemetery in Fort Lick, where his father is buried, and fatally shot himself beside the grave. His body was found by relatives. Robin Smith was conscious and speaking when police arrived at her home shortly before 10am and was airlifted to the University of Tennessee Hospital, where she is in critical but stable condition. Raymond Smith was elected in 2002 and served as judge executive between 2003 and 2007. In the role, he was responsible for overseeing the money and expenses for the county, similar to a chief financial officer. But his term was wrought with problems.

The semi-private seats are curtain-enclosed areas which the mother and her new-born can sit in, away from the glare of other passengers. Bizarre: A Chinese city has introduced 'lactation rooms' on its public buses for women who want to breastfeed . They have emerged following campaigns in China this year to promote breastfeeding and increase the number of public spaces for women. Despite health authorities in China agreeing on the benefits of breastfeeding, the rate of breastfeeding for children under the age of 6 months is just 28 per cent. The issues of breastfeeding in China is steeped in controversy with the argument against wrapped in layers of traditional beliefs and misconceptions. Earlier this year, UNICEF launched a campaign to promote the use of public spaces for breastfeeding. Because of a lack of public facilities to accommodate breastfeeding mothers, there is a very small proportion of mothers who understand the advantages of it. Through the campaign, it is hoped that more public spaces can be found and used. As reported by China.org, mothers in China recently called for employers to provide private locations at worksites to allow them to pump their breast milk. Breastfeeding is said to promote health for both mother and infant and helps to prevent disease. It has also been associated with better mental health through childhood and into adolescence. Artificial feeding is said to be associated with more deaths from diarrhea in infants in both developing and developed countries.","Specially-designed seats being rolled out on public bus system in Zhengzhou .

Ms Bush is currently working as the CEO of Global Health Corps, a company she helped start with partner Dave Ryan. She's been spending much of the last year traveling throughout Africa, but she's still made time to start a relationship with Miky Fabrega, who lives in Panama. Former first daughter: Barbara Bush recently spoke with People about her new boyfriend, niece Mila and her support for a Hillary Clinton bid for president in 2016 . The family Bush: Barbara Bush, far left, followed by her mother Laura Bush, father and former President George W Bush and twin sister Jenna Hager . The painter and creative consultant was Ms Bush's date for her father's presidential library dedication in April - and says her father approves of the new boyfriend. 'My dad is obsessed with art right now,' Ms Bush told People, referring to Mr Bush's recent foray into painting. 'So anyone that likes art, he is excited about.' Father's approval: Ms Bush says her father is a fan of new boyfriend Miky Fabreja, sitting on her left at the dedication of the George W Bush Presidential Library last April .

Getting serious: Despite constantly traveling for her job, and the fact that her boyfriend lives in another country, the two have been pictured together quite a lot . Pets are a favorite subject of the former president, and Ms Bush said that her cat had sat twice in her father's studio. Though she has no political affiliation, the republican president's daughter admitted that she's rooting for Hillary Clinton to run for president in 2016.

A man from southern New Jersey has apparently killed his wife and young son before taking his own life in what police consider to be a murder-suicide. The tragedy unfolded Tuesday in Pitman - a town of about 9,000 located 15 miles south of Philadelphia - where local authorities found the bodies of 49-year-old Francis Adolf, his 44-year-old wife, Bonnie, and the couple's 6-year-old son, Francis Jr. Authorities say when they arrived at the home of the Adolf family, they found the husband's writings indicating that he intended to harm himself and his loved ones. Family tragedy: Police say 49-year-old Francis Adolf (left) murdered his wife, Bonnie (right), 44, and their 6-year-old son before taking his own life . Crime scene: A police vehicle is parked outside the Adolfs' home on Kenton Avenue in Pitman, New Jersey, where three family members were found dead . The medical examiner is expected to perform autopsies on the bodies to determine the cause and manner of death. Police arrived at 65 Kenton Avenue at around 10am Tuesday to perform a welfare check after getting a call from someone expressing concern. As officers walked into the house, they discovered the bodies of Francis Adolf, his wife and son. Handwritten notes and emails authored by Francis Adolf led investigators to believe that he had planned to kill his family and then himself. Mr Adolf worked as a nurse at Virtua Health System along with his wife, and was a self-described Christian libertarian. According to his Facebook page, he attended Gloucester County Community Church. According to Bonnie Adolf's page, the woman graduated from Helene Fuld School of Nursing in Camden in 1990. The couple married in 2004. Francis Adolf had been active on Twitter and had 210 followers. Outlining his personal philosophy, he wrote: ‘I'm a Christian Libertarian but I frequenty [sic] find myself tweeting in the flesh, and sometimes in the nude too.’ Grisly: Officials are seen wheeling away the body of one of the victims on a gurney; the medical examiner will perform autopsies to determine the cause of death . Alarming: Officers were performing a welfare check after getting a phone call when they came upon the dead family. Cops also found Francis Adolf's writings indicating that he had been planning to harm his family . The 49-year-old nurse posted messages criticizing President Barack Obama and his signature health care legislation; the Catholic Church and social welfare. Some of his tweets were particularly odd. On July 27, he wrote: ‘Finally, out of the ER. Driving/texting and the Percocet is kicking in. Weeeeeeeeeee!!!’ Three days later, Mr Adolf posted an enigmatic message on Twitter, writing: 'Goodbye forever twitter. My Marriage is too important. Pray for me, my wife and family. Love you all. Thanks.' Local authorities have said that there was no history of domestic abuse in the Adolf household, although one neighbor recalled hearing loud arguments between Bonnie and Francis. Other homeowners in the area described the 49-year-old husband and father as asocial and not very talkative, with at least one person, Gus Bader, labeling him as ‘strange,’ according to NJ.com. Members of the tight-knit community were left in equal measures shocked and puzzled after learning of the tragedy. Neighbors told NBC 10 Philadelphia that Francis Adolf Jr, known to all as Frankie, was about to turn 7 years old and was getting ready to enter second grade at Memorial Elementary School. Last tweet: On July 30, Mr Adolf posted an enigmatic message on Twitter, writing: 'Goodbye forever twitter. My Marriage is too important. Pray for me, my wife and family. Love you all. Thanks' Pitman Mayor Russ Johnson III said the slain boy and his own son were classmates. ‘You've got to do your best as parents but I don't know how I can possibly explain it to my kid -- to any of those kids in that school,’ the mayor said. The elementary school sent a statement out to parents, saying that Frankie died in a tragic incident. ‘Everyone here in the district -- especially those within the Memorial School community -- is heartbroken about the loss of Frankie,’ the missive read. ‘We extend our sympathy to all of Frankie's family and friends, and to the wider community of Pitman, on this very sad day.’ Local resident Jack Klose, 66, described the 6-year-old victim as a 'beautiful boy' who was his grandson's best friend. Francis Adolf’s mother, Delores, told The Philadelphia Inquirer she could not explain what happened. ‘Bad things happen to good people,’ she summed it up.","Officers found bodies of Francis Adolf, 49, his wife, Bonnie, 44, and their 6-year-old son, Francis Jr, in their Pitman, New Jersey home .

Doctors say the 12-year-old girl who contracted a deadly amoeba while swimming at an Arkansas water park will be the third to survive the brain-eating parasite. Kali Hardig contracted parasitic meningitis, a very rare form of meningitis that only 130 people have been diagnosed with in the U.S. in the past fifty years, a month ago. It's 99 per cent fatal with only two reported instances of survival. But doctors now believe Kali will make it out of the woods, due in large part to early detection and experimental treatment. Scroll down for video . Getting better: Doctors believe 12-year-old Kali Hardig will survive her rare form of meningitis she got from an amoeba at an Arkansas water park . Good signs: Kali wrote her name for the first time Monday, left, after only barely being able to squeeze her mother's hand a week ago . Kali was brought into the Arkansas Children's Hospital on July 19 with a fever, not long after she went swimming at the Willow Springs Water Park in Little Rock. Doctors diagnosed her with primary amebic meningoencephalitis (PAM), a rare form of meningitis which has only produced 130 cases in the U.S in the past 50 years. The rare form of meningitis is caused by the Naegleria fowleri amoeba entering the body through the nose and traveling into the brain. Symptoms appear quickly, about one to seven days after inception, and include headache, fever, nausea, vomiting and get worse causing stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, seizures and hallucinations. Eventually the infection destroys brain tissue which causes fatal brain swelling. To combat the the infection, doctors cooled Kali's body to reduce the swelling and even put her on breast-cancer drugs. 'She wound up being on a ventilator for over two weeks,' said Dr. Mark Heulitt, one of the doctors who treated her. But the treatment seems to have worked, and she was taken off the ventilator on August 6. Three days later, Kali was moved out of the pediatric intensive care unit. Making strides: Doctors believe early detection and experimental treatments are helping Kali get over her infection . Stronger: Kali was taken off a ventilator and transferred out of the pediatric intensive care unit last week . On Monday her family posted a picture on a Facebook support page of Kali writing her name for the first time. That's remarkable progress for a girl who was barely able to squeeze her mother's hand last week. They are obviously ecstatic at the change of outlook. 'We've went from being told that our little girl wouldn't survive this amoeba to now they're saying that Kali is going to be the third survivor and going to get to go home,' said her mother Traci Hardig. Mother's battle: Traci Hardig, Kali's mother, is battling breast cancer and is focusing on being healthy to take care of her daughter when she is released from the hospital . Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots of their noses. The amoeba needs very specific conditions to thrive. It grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85 degrees. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the last 50 years. Only one person has survived in the United States. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Health officials say swimmers can reduce their risks even further by: . Ms Hardig, who is battling breast . cancer, is now making sure to focus on her health so she can take care . of Kali when she gets home. 'It's kind of a battle to decide that . you want to put your health on hold because you want to totally focus on . Kali, but I know I have to try to get myself better too, because Kali's . coming home and I'm going to get to take care of her,' she said. Ms Hardig is also hoping to raise awareness of another case of PAM. Zachary Reyna is being treated for the infection at Miami Children's Hospital. He contracted the amoeba while knee boarding in a ditch near his house with friends in LaBelle, Florida earlier this month. 'We're praying for him to be survivor number four,' Ms Hardig said. The condition is caused when the Naegleria parasite enters a patient's brain, usually after accidentally inhaling stagnant, warm water up the nose while swimming. Arkansas Department of Health spokesman Ed Barham told MailOnline the water must be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide. Naegleria are found in nearly every freshwater body of water - even lakes. But, they only become active when water heats up. The . cruel irony of the parasite is that the risk is highest when the . temperature is hottest - and swimmers are looking for a reprieve from . the heat. The CDC says there . have been around 130 cases of the disease in the U.S. in the last five decades . - making the disease extremely rare, when compared to the number of . lakes and muddy swimming holes Americans dip into for refuge from the . summer heat each year. Another case: 12-year-old Zachary Reyna of LaBelle, Florida is also fighting the infection after contracting the amoeba knee boarding in a ditch earlier this month . The U.S. has recorded just 130 cases of Naegleria fowleri infections in the last 50 years . The amoebas are most active when the water temperature reaches about 85 degrees, Barham said. However, this is the second time the parasite has infected a swimmer at Willow Springs Water Park. In August 2010, 7-year-old Davian Briggs died after contracting the disease after he had been swimming at the lake. Because two cases have been seen from the same body was water, state health officials asked the park owners to close their swimming hole. They obliged. 'Though the odds of contracting Naegleria are extremely low, they are just not good enough to allow our friends or family to swim,' owners David and Lou Ann Ratliff said in a statement. Closed: The owners of Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas, have shut down the lake after learning of two reported cases of the deadly disease in three years . Another tragedy: Davian Briggs, 7, died of the disease in 2010 after swimming at the Willow Springs Water Park - where little Kali is believed to have been infected . The park, which attracts up to 250 swimmers a day - and thousands over the course of a summer - is now looking into installing a hard pool bottom at the swimming hole and filling it with chlorinated water supplied by Little Rock. Kali's mother said she had no idea about the risks of swimming in warm lakes and had never heard of the disease. 'You're a mom, you're a dad. You can still take your child swimming. We don't want to scare people. We just want you to know there are little things you can do to help them out. So they can go and still be a kid,' she said. She encourages parents to make their children wear nose plugs while swimming - to minimize the risk of inhaling water through the nose and contracting the Naegleria parasite. Still, Barham, of the health department, says that swimmers really shouldn't be too concerned about the danger of swimming in fresh water.","Kali Hardig, 12, contracted primary amoebic meningoencephalitis after swimming at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas .

The mother of the baby murdered by a nurse in 1982 has made a desperate plea to find more victims so her daughter's killer will not be released from prison after serving just one third of her sentence. Petti McClellan's daughter Chelsea was just 15-months-old when she was repeatedly injected with a lethal substance by Genene Anne Jones - who was later sentenced to 99 years in prison for the murder. It is believed Jones killed as many as 46 babies under her care at Bexar County Hospital while she worked there from 1977 - 1982. If she gets out, she will have served less than one year for every infant death she is suspected of being involved in. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO .

This is my mission now' Victim: Jones was sentenced to 99 years in prison for the 1982 murder of 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan who died under her care at Bexar County Hospital . Petti is making it her mission to . find a family whose baby may have been taken away from them at the hands . of Jones so she can keep her in prison forever. The 63-year-old could be released as soon as 2018 under an expired Texas law that grants a 'mandatory release' to inmates with good behavior. If Petti has her way she will remain behind bars, but the shocking news of her early release has forced her to relive the day her daughter died. Nurse: Genene Jones was convicted of murdering 15-month-old Chelsea McClellan in 1984 . 'Jones was working at a new pediatric clinic in Kerrville,' she told ABCNews.com. 'I remember being so excited to have a neighborhood . pediatrician that I could take Chelsea and my son Cameron to. 'Cameron was about three-years-old when he got the flu so I took him into . the clinic, and I brought Chelsea with me. 'As we . sat in the waiting room, Genene said she would update Chelsea's shots. 'I took Chelsea and followed Genene into the examining room. I noticed . that the syringes were already fixed. 'I was holding Chelsea, she was . facing me, and Jones gave her the first shot in her left thigh. Immediately Chelsea had trouble breathing. She tried to say my name and couldn't.' Before she could stop her, Jones gave baby Chelsea a second shot in her right leg. That's when she stopped breathing. 'Genene had this wild look in her eyes, like she was on a high,' Petti recalls. 'She got . really excited, and she yelled that Chelsea was not breathing. She . grabbed her from me and put her on a table. She told me to go get . the doctor.' By the time an ambulance came to the clinic, a doctor had stabilized Chelsea and she was breathing on her own. Doctors wanted to transfer the toddler . to a bigger hospital in San Antonio where she could be monitored. Petti . followed in her car while Jones was riding in the ambulance with two . EMTs. Her baby died during that ride after Jones again injected her with succinylcholine chloride, claiming she was having a seizure. The EMTs testified in her murder trial that Chelsea's vitals were fine.

Talking about the death of her . daughter, Petti told ABC: 'It was a real mother's terror. I was a mess, I . just fell apart. I don't remember much from that moment.'

Three years after an unidentified woman was found abandoned in a hospital waiting room, wearing only an adult diaper and hospital gown, Alabama authorities have found her name and the person who was supposed to be caring for her. Unable to speak, and with no identification, Edith Allen's history had been a mystery until Monday. Her carers had scant clues to go on - just a cesarean section scar and initials in her dentures. However, a tip off finally led authorities to Ms Allen's carer Cathy Jean Thomas, of Douglasville, Georgia, who faces charges of claiming more than $25,000 in Ms Allen's social security checks over the past three years. Named: Three years after she was found abandoned, Edith Allen has her identity back . 'It's a relief to me. It's been a long, . drawn-out process over something that should have never happened,' Alabama Bureau of Investigation agent Lieutenant Scott . Bartle, who has led the search for Ms Allen's identity, told Al.com. Because Ms Allen, who was named Sally by the medical staff who have cared for her since she was found in August 2010, did not have an identity she was unable to qualify for Medicaid. The 68-year-old woman, who had a urinary tract infection, and was dehydrated and malnourished when she was found, has built up medical bills of $200,000 in the past three years. Although she can barely speak and has learning disabilities, Ms Allen did try to help authorities identify her. 'She would attempt to write her name and, what's really sad, is, if you look at the name she was attempting to give the hospitals here in Oneonta, it matches the name and the signature that she would give to the adult day care she stayed at in Georgia,' Blount County district attorney Pamela Casey said. From the start, officers feared someone may still be claiming her social security checks. Thomas, 59, became the disabled woman's carer in 2009 and, according to authorities, . filled out the necessary paperwork to take charge of Ms Allen's social . security benefits. 'Thomas . did acknowledge receiving Edith Allen's money and using it to obtain . goods and services that never went to Allen,' Lieutenant Bartle said. 'For three . years, she has reaped the benefits of those checks.' Charged: Cathy Jean Thomas, who was Edith Allen's carer, is accused of identity theft . He added that Thomas, who has been charged with identity theft, denied being the one who abandoned Ms Allen, who weighed less than 90lb when she was found at the hospital. Ms Allen was originally cared for by Thomas's sister until she died, which was when Thomas took over, according to Al.com. The search for Ms Allen's identity was further hampered because her short blonde hair had been dyed dark and she was wearing large, black-rimmed glasses when she was found, possibly in an attempt to disguise her. Several newspaper articles and television reports featured her story, and fingerprints and DNA were taken in the hope of finding a match in missing persons databases. 'The Alabama Bureau of Investigation probably followed over 1,000 to 2,000 leads,' Ms Casey told ABC3340. In 2011 Ms Allen's new carers spoke to the press again in the hope of finding her relatives, or anyone who knew her. Although they did not provide immediate leads, her story was carried on various social media sites, which eventually helped identify her. After a tip off to LostNMissing, a non-profit volunteer group, officials were able to match Ms Allen with her medical and financial records. Thomas has since been charged and is being held on a $50,000 bond. Ms Casey said she now wants to pass Edith's Law, which would give more security to those with learning disabilities and help stop others being treated in the same way as Ms Allen was. 'We have to do something about this. We have to be able to identify these people and we have to make sure the benefits that are provided to them are actually going to them and for them,' she said. Ms Allen's court-appointed guardian, attorney Sid Summey, is thrilled that her identity has been revealed. Protection: District attorney Pamela Casey wants to introduce laws to protect patients like Ms Allen . 'A lot of compassion has poured out for this lady.

Authorities say the body of a woman found last week near a Northern California park was that of missing federal defense investigator, Sandra Coke, of Oakland. Police would not say how she died or offer any more information on a possible link between her death and 56-year-old Randy Alana, a violent sex offender and Coke's former boyfriend. A major hunt began at the Solano County fairgrounds in Vallejo late . on Thursday and continued until a body was discovered by Contra Costa County sheriff's search and . rescue teams in a woody area near Laguna Valley Park, Vacaville, on Friday. Tragedy: Sandra Coke, 50, whose body has been discovered after she never returned from answering a call about her missing dog . Authorities . remained tight-lipped about what led dozens of local, state and federal . investigators to the area and only confirmed yesterday that the body was that of the missing investigator. Colleagues and friends have expressed their devastation at the news of the death of Coke, 50, who spent decades advocating justice for inmates of death row. 'It's been real heartbreaking,' said . Bryan Stevenson, director of the Equal Justice Initiative in Alabama, . where Coke worked in the mid-1990s. 'She was just a wonderful person and . skilled and committed advocate. It's a terrible, terrible loss.' Starting in the 1990s, Coke worked for the California . Appellate Project, the San Francisco Public Defender's Office, the Equal . Justice Initiative of Alabama and her own private investigation office. At the time of her death, she had been working for the Office of the Federal Defender in the . Eastern District of California in Sacramento, where she helped overturn . a wrongfully obtained murder conviction in Sacramento County in 2001, . according to federal defender Heather Williams. Search: Members of Sonoma County rescue team discovered Coke's body in an Oakland park after a two-day hunt . Announcement: Solano County Sheriff spokesman Daryl Snedeker (second from right) refused to confirm that the body was Coke's until Tuesday . Thorough: Multiple agencies searched for evidence in the case of Sandra Coke . Coke left her Oakland home shortly . after 8.30 pm on August 4 after reportedly telling her 15-year-old daughter . she was meeting with someone who had found her missing dog. She said she would be back in 30 minutes. Her daughter called police when her mother did not come home that night. Later that night, she was seen with Alana, a . high-risk sex offender with a lengthy criminal history whom she dated . some 20 years ago, police said. Sources said that video has been recovered showing Coke's car crossing the Carquinez Bridge after her disappearance. Her car was subsequently found in a West Oakland . parking lot, and one of her cellphones was found in Richmond last week. Alana, 56, of Oakland, a registered sex offender with convictions for voluntary manslaughter, rape and kidnapping, was arrested on an unspecified parole violation on August 6. He . has not yet been named a suspect or charged in Coke's death. Oakland police Officer Johnna Watson said: 'We are looking at an angle to see if foul play was involved.' A family friend, Laura Burstein, said . Coke dated Alana more than 20 years ago. Another friend, Dan . Abrahamson, told KGO-TV, that Alana recently reappeared in the area and . reached out to Coke for help. Alana . was being held without bail. He is considered a high-risk sex offender, . with state records showing he has convictions for rape and kidnapping. Dozens of Coke's family and friends announced a $100,000 reward on Thursday for any information leading to her return. ‘These last few days have been a living nightmare,’ said her sister, Tanya Coke, who believes foul play may be involved. Questioned: Former boyfriend Randy Alana was arrested in connection with Coke's disappearance, but police refuse to confirm any links between the former convicted sex offender and her death . Calls . to Tanya Coke on Friday were not immediately returned. Earlier, Sandra . Coke's family released a statement hoping for her return. ‘We . are enormously grateful for the efforts of everyone - law enforcement, . colleagues and friends of Sandra, and members of the public and the . media - who have labored day and night - to find Sandra,’ the statement . read. Police found . Coke's 2007 Mini Cooper convertible on Monday, just a few blocks from . her home and her cellphones were discovered near the Oakland-Emeryville . border and near Interstate 80 in Richmond. On Tuesday afternoon, Coke's family released a statement thanking law . enforcement, the public and others for helping in the search. 'The Coke family is devastated by the loss of our beloved Sandra,' the . statement read. 'She was a loving mother, daughter, sister and auntie, . and a shining light in our family; her good cheer, easy laugh and . generous hugs will be missed. 'Those of us who were privileged to know Sandra will remember her as an . unusually kind, generous and big-hearted person. 'She passionately . devoted her professional life to helping the poor and those who endured . difficult childhoods. 'All of us will miss Sandra's beautiful, giving . spirit.' Coke came to Alabama in 1995, a time when juveniles could be put to . death for crimes, and when the juvenile death row population, at 16 . inmates, was the largest in the nation, her colleague Bryan Stevenson said. As . an investigator, she was assigned to probe capital cases that are . appealed to federal court to ensure death sentences are fair. Her work . collecting school records and interviewing family and friends uncovered . that most of the juveniles suffered traumatic childhoods, evidence not . presented during trial. It was Coke's gentle way of interviewing inmates and their families that Stevenson remembers most. 'She had a wonderful way of endearing people to her and persuading . people to talk to her about difficult things,' he said. The family asked for privacy to mourn and thanked friends for . creating a fund to provide for her daughter's care and education. Donations to that fund can be made at www.sandracokefund.org.

A biplane of the British Royal Flying Corps and a Deutsche Luftstreitkraefte fighter hurtle towards each other in the midst of the First World War battle for the skies, crashing in flames, the pilots miraculously escaping to safety amid the smoke and the blaze... These spectacular photographs have become famous as some of the most dramatic records of the war in the air, and are expected to fetch a princely sum at auction in Australia today. Yet they're all completely bogus. Clash of the titans: The photographs appear to show British and German warplanes mid-combat . That hasn't stopped Wesley David Archer's photographs from becoming coveted by collectors - partly for their bizarre history. The photos first came to public notice in the 1930s, when one 'Gladys Maud Cockburne-Lange', who claimed to be the widow of a British air ace, went to a publisher with a trove of photos her husband had reportedly taken with a camera mounted on his plane. Mrs Cockburne-Lange claimed the pilot had set up the shutter to be triggered with a machine gun. The publisher at the time was understandably wowed by the incredible shots - so much so that he paid $20,000 for the work. The pictures then became the basis for a book, Death In The Air: The War Diary And Photographs Of A Flying Corps Pilot, which was published in 1933. Archer claimed it was the journal of an anonymous Flying Corps pilot killed in combat. Incredible: The pilot appears to eject to safety from the German fighter plane . True story: The pictures formed the basis of a book of Archer's experiences, even though they had been set up with miniature planes on wires . The photos caused a sensation, appearing in newspapers and gallery exhibitions. To begin with, no one seemed to notice that the clear, high-speed images were well beyond the capabilities of cameras and film available at the time. Nor did the fact that British aeroplanes were smack in the middle of several frames - meaning the pilot would have been firing on his mates - raise any initial eyebrows. The 'widow' quickly disappeared from public view once she had cashed in on the images. But it wasn’t until 1984 that the images were definitely declared fakes, after the effects of Wesley David Archer - a former American pilot and early movie special effects man - were donated to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D.C. The trove included a number of photos similar to the Cockburn-Lange images — but before Archer had airbrushed out the wires holding up the miniature planes. Archer, according to Petapixel.com, had fallen on hard times during the Depression. He created the aerial tableaux, using his skills in visual trickery, then had his wife pose as Mrs. Cockburn-Lange to sell them. The money they made from the fake shots was enough to tide the couple over until Archer could find a more suitable outlet for his talents in the film industry. Bidding starts today at Noble Numismatics for a collection of 34 of the images.","Special effects man Wesley David Archer faked shots in 1930s .

A British bride who went to live in Gambia with her husband was found hanged after he told her he could not father children. Simone Lally, 27, left her home in Lancashire for a new life with Mohammed  Jabakhanji, 29, and hoped to start a family. But only a year after their beachside wedding, he discovered her dead in their home. Tragic: Simone Jabakhanji moved to Africa from Lancashire to start a new life with her husband Mohammed but was found hanged at their home shortly after he discovered he was infertile . An inquest was told their  relationship was tempestuous from the start and marred by  frequent arguments. The couple ran into problems when . medical tests showed Mr Jabakhanji had been left infertile by his . unhealthy lifestyle of smoking cannabis and drinking. Just days before she died in August . 2011, Mrs Jabakhanji called her mother and best friend to tell them she . had fallen out with her husband and his family. Mr Jabakhanji, who is from Ghana, . reported the death at their home in the capital Banjul and was initially . arrested on suspicion of murder. He was later released without charge. Happier times: Simone and her husband, who was known as Carlos, pictured on their wedding day in a Gambian beach ceremony . The hearing, held in  Preston, was . told that Mrs Jabakhanji had been travelling to Gambia for many years . and met her future husband in 2009. The couple were married in a beachside . ceremony there on  Valentine’s Day 2010 attended by her family, . including brother Paul and mother Janice. Mrs Lally said she spoke to her daughter about her husband, who was known as Carlos, on the evening of her death. Dream wedding: Simone pictured at her beach wedding on Valentine's day in 2010 with her mother Janice and Peter Lally in Banjul, Gambia . ‘She had phoned because she and Carlos . had an argument, she always wanted to speak with me or her friend when . they had an  argument,’ she said. Mrs Lally said she had concerns about . the relationship as her daughter complained that her husband had become . aggressive after returning from Ghana, where tests had revealed his . infertility. She said her daughter was used to her . husband going ‘into his own space’ for days after a row and then . pretending nothing had happened. Mrs Lally told the hearing: ‘She said . “I suppose I can put up with that instead of him breaking my legs”. When . I spoke to her on the  Friday, she was frightened of Carlos. ‘I spoke to him eventually and he promised me that he would look after her.’ Despite the devastating news that her new husband could be infertile Mrs Jabakhanji's mother Janice said she seemed 'normal' when they spoke on the day of her death . Just hours later, Mrs Lally spoke to him again. She said: ‘I had a phone call off Carlos two minutes after midnight. ‘He was crying. I kept asking, “What’s the matter?” He said, “It’s Simone, she’s dead”.’ Close friend Abigail Stone told the inquest that she had also spoken to Mrs Jabakhanji via video link on the day of her death. She said the couple had a furious row after Mr Jabakhanji accused his wife of disrespecting his family. Miss Stone advised her friend to return to England but she insisted on remaining with her husband. Coroner Simon Jones said there had been no co-operation from the Gambian authorities over the death, despite repeated requests. No autopsy was carried out in Gambia and the body had been embalmed before repatriation to England. Mr Jones recorded an open verdict, saying: ‘There is very little information about the circumstances.’ It was not possible to be certain Mrs . Jabakhanji meant to end her life, he added. ‘That would be at odds with . conversations she had with  family and friends. Similarly there is no . evidence to suggest anyone else was involved.’","Simone Jabakhanji, 27, moved to Gambia in 2009 to be with Mohammed after the pair met during a family holiday .

The photo has appalled Chinese internet users who have set up an online search for clues to the baby's identity. This photograph (pixellated by MailOnline) of the newborn baby drowned in a river has horrified people in China . 'Abandoning babies is not new but most people do it at a place where the child will have a choice of a new life,' said one. 'Dumping a baby in a river to die is inhuman,' China has a one-baby policy, introduced in 1979 to keep the country's population under control, which restricts urban couples to having just one child. Despite egalitarian policies in China, many families hope to have a son to provide for them in their old age, and as a result the country has a higher rate of female infanticide and lower ration of female: male births. Ultrasounds, commonly used in western countries to assess risks of problems with babies in utero, are not allowed in China because of the risk of couples aborting babies if the scan shows that they are not the parents' preferred gender.

The London-based luxury shirt brand has accused the British arm of the U.S. underwear giant of misleading its customers by using the name Pink to market and sell its line, which is aimed at teenagers.

The Chanel designer 9right) described the German Chancellor (left) as having 'special proportions . The outspoken Chanel creative director – who has previously come under fire for his controversial comments about singer Adele and other well-known females – criticised the German political figure for the trousers she wore in a meeting with United States President, Barack Obama, in June. He told Germany's Focus magazine: 'Miss Merkel [should dress] according to her special proportions. [When she was pictured with Obama], the proportions were bad, like the cut. The pants were too long.' Angela is the latest woman to feel the brunt of the 79-year-old fashion designer's acid tongue, following his criticism of Adele, Pippa Middleton and Michelle Obama. Never one to shy away from controversy, Karl famously branded the 'Skyfall' hitmaker a 'little too fat' in February 2012, while complimenting her ""beautiful face and divine voice"" at the same time. Karl gave singer Adele a rather backhanded compliment. While complimenting her voice he also stated that she was 'a little too fat' Pippa Middleton was also on the sharp end of Karl's tongue when he said she should only ever show her back . The designer also insisted Pippa Middleton – sister to Britain's Duchess Catherine – should  'only ever show her back', and recently claimed: 'I think that her sister looks better.' More recently, Karl gave his unflinching opinion of US First Lady Michelle Obama's fringe haircut, saying: 'Frankly, the fringe was a bad idea.'","Chanel director Karl Lagerfeld has criticised the German Chancellor .

Nahella Hard, 32, was told her husband has brain tumour just eight days after she learnt her baby has brain damage. But the mother-of-two is refusing to let the double tragedy affect their daily lives. Nahella Hard, 32, was told her husband, Anthony, 33, has brain tumour just eight days after she learnt her baby, 18-month-old Casey, has severe brain damage . She said: ‘We were a happy family before this and we will carry on the same way. ‘Every moment with my boys is a blessing and we just take each day as it comes.’ Mrs Hard went into labour in November 2011 with her husband Anthony, 33, at her side. There were complications during the birth but the couple took baby Casey home unaware there was anything wrong. However, when he didn’t develop normally doctors carried out an MRI scan and found that he had extensive brain damage. The couple were still reeling from the blow when Mr Hard had a seizure at his RAF base, after suffering from headaches.

Mrs Hard says that she will do everything possible to ensure that family life carries on as normal for the sake of the couple's daughter, Teagan, nine . Mr Hard said: 'I'm so proud of our family. We've been through so much and Nahella has been incredible. She's the most amazing wife and mum' Now doctors can only buy Mr Hard time with radiotherapy and surgery to ‘chip away’ at the tumour. Mrs Hard spends her days caring for her two ‘boys’ while getting on with the job of being a housewife and mother to Teagan. Whatever the future holds the family say they will stay positive.

TV star Martin Clunes stepped in to stop a 'nonsensical' operation on his wife using medical knowledge gleaned from his nine years playing grumpy GP Doc Martin. The actor, who made his name on Men Behaving Badly, stopped a surgeon taking out Philippa Braithwaite's appendix 'because it was the wrong thing to do'. The 51-year-old also admitted medics may have actually thought he was West Country doctor Thomas 'Doc' Martin because they handed him his wife's medical notes when he arrived to visit her in hospital. Scroll down for video . Life imitating art: Martin Clunes stepped in to stop a 'nonsensical' operation on his wife Philippa using knowledge built up playing curmudgeon GP Doc Martin on TV . 'You have to remember that British medical dramas are obliged to be . accurate. You can't just make things up as they do on American shows. 'So . we have a medical expert on the series and I have learned about certain . conditions and procedures,' he told Reader's Digest. Mr Clunes married his second wife Phillipa in 1997, who is producer on Doc Martin, which has been running since 2004. He has said he had to get involved when doctors said they wanted to carry out what he described as a 'nonsensical' operation. He said: 'She had an infection in her gall bladder and the surgeon was minded to take out her appendix. There was no infection in her appendix and instinct told me that it would be the wrong thing to do. So I took her home instead and she was treated there. 'As Philippa's husband, it was my prerogative to do this. But when I was chatting to hospital staff they handed me her medical notes to look at in a way they might not have with an ordinary member of the public. 'I do wonder whether there wasn't some confusion between me and Doc Martin.' Mistaken identity: 'Doc' deals with a collapsed patient on screen, but Mr Clunes admitted hospital staff may have confused him with the character after they handed him his wife's medical notes when he arrived to see her . But it is not the first time he has saved the day. In 2011 the actor came to the aid of a baby boy who played his newborn son in the TV series and who needed urgent funds for vital medical equipment. Alfie Cane, who when six-months-old played the GP’s newborn baby James Henry, has a rare condition which means he cannot support his head. He also has a misshapen skull, which could cause serious complications if left untreated. His parents Tilly and Adrian needed to raise £2,000 to pay for a helmet which can strengthen Alfie’s muscles and reshape his skull as it grows.

Apple will never hit the heights it did under Steve Jobs and is set for a grim and steady decline says the man who knew him best. Oracle CEO and America's third richest man, Larry Ellison told CBS News that without the guiding force of the mercurial Jobs, Apple will 'not be nearly so successful because he's gone.' Best friends for a quarter of a century with Jobs, who passed away in October 2011, Ellison, who is worth $43 billion, said that ultimately the Apple chief was 'irreplaceable.' Candid: Larry Ellison made it plain that Apple would struggle without Steve Jobs and he expected them to decline in an interview with CBS News . Labeling Jobs as an 'incredible inventor' and 'our Edison, our Picasso', Ellison, 68, said that despite the caliber of people still at the Cupertino, California firm, the company is still likely to decline without its co-founder. 'I'm not shorting Apple. I like Tim Cook. I think there are a lot of talented people there...but Steve is irreplaceable,' said Ellison to CBS News. During the course of the wide ranging interview with Charlie Rose, Ellison described his friends battle with cancer. 'We'd always go for walks. And the walks just kept getting shorter,' said Ellison to CBS News. 'Until near the end we'd kind of walk around the block or maybe - maybe four blocks, something like that. 'And you just watched him getting weaker. And this is the strongest guy I knew. This was absolutely the strongest, most willful person I have ever met.' Visionary: Larry Ellison said that without Steve Jobs - this generation's 'Edison and Picasso' Apple would struggle to match the heights they hit under their co-founder . New Relationship: Laurene Powell is now moving on with her life and is seeing former Washington D.C. mayor Adrian Fenty . Struggles Ahead: Larry Ellison said that current CEO Tim Cook is talented but unfortunately for him Steve Jobs was 'irreplaceable' An emotional Ellison said that in the end 'the cancer wore him out' and after almost a decade battling the disease, Jobs made the decision to end his regime of medication. 'He was just tired of fighting, tired of the pain,' said Ellison. 'And he decided, shocked Lorraine (his wife), shocked everybody that the medication was gonna stop. 'He just pulled off the meds, I think on a Saturday or a Sunday. And by the following Wednesday he was gone.' During the interview, Ellison turned his attention to Google CEO Larry Page, 'specifically' for what the Oracle CEO believes was his decision to 'take our stuff'. Ellison's Oracle is currently involved in a bitter legal fight with Google over programming language for the Android operating system. 'We don't compete with Google,' said Ellison. 'We don't do anything Google does. We just think they took our stuff and that was wrong. 'That's a completely separate issue...I think what they did was - was - absolutely evil. 'Larry makes the decision over there. He runs that company. And they decided, let me be very clear. When you write a program for the Android phone, you write it. 'You use the Oracle tool, Oracle Java tools, for everything. And at the very end, you press a button and said, 'Covert this to android format.' Google CEO Larry Page and his business practice was attacked by Oracle CEO Larry Ellison in the interview with Charlie Rose on CBS News . In light of his controversial comments, Ellison clarified that he did not believe that Larry Page, known for his 'Don't Be Evil' motto, 'slipped up this one time' and added that it was the actions and not Page that were evil. 'This really bothers me,' said Ellison. 'I don't know how he thinks you can just copy someone else's stuff. It really bothers me.' When asked about whistleblower Edward Snowden and his online security and government surveillance revelations, Ellison said that these NSA programs were 'great' and 'essential'. 'By the way, President Obama thinks it's essential,' Ellison said to CBS News. 'It's essential if we want to minimize the kind of strikes that we just had in Boston. It's absolutely essential'. Indeed, Ellison's comments on Apple came just three weeks after the Californian firm was overtaken by Samsung to become the world's most profitable mobile phone company. Necessary: Larry Ellison endorsed the revelations made by NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden . Apple’s share of the smartphone market dropped to 14 per cent, its lowest for three years, because of ‘lackluster’ iPhone 5 sales and tougher competition from rivals, according to industry analysts. Driven by demand for cheaper Android devices in Asia and Latin America, Samsung’s handset  division made an estimated £3.4billion operating profit in the second quarter of this year. The South Korea-based electronics giant, also the world’s biggest TV company, made 27.7 per cent of all phones sold during the quarter. Apple’s iPhone was said to be ‘underperforming’ with an estimated operating profit of £3billion according to research firm Strategy Analytics. In the past, while selling fewer phones, the more expensive iPhone has kept Apple’s profits ahead of competitors’. But with no new products to do battle with Samsung’s latest, the Galaxy S4, Apple finally lost its crown. Neil Shah, of Strategy Analytics, said: ‘With strong volumes, high wholesale prices and tight cost controls, Samsung has finally succeeded in becoming the handset industry’s largest and most profitable vendor.’ However, experts say Apple could overtake Samsung again when it launches its next iPhone model.","Oracle CEO told interviewer that Steve Jobs was irreplaceable and that Apple would now struggle going forward business wise .

Boost: Investor Carl Icahn tweeted he had bought Apple shares and withing three hours the value rocked by $17bn . Apple's shares rocketed by $17billion in less than two hours after a legendary U.S. investor tweeted he had bought a large stake in the company. Carl Icahn told his 40,000 followers he was backing the business and said its price was 'undervalued', kick-starting a chain reaction that sent the markets wild. At around 1pm yesterday Apple shares were valued at around $472billion, but by 4pm they hit $489billion, a rise of 4.75 per cent. He sent the message at 2.21pm, causing a rise of $171million every minute until the market closed. The activist investor also said her had a 'nice conversation' with CEO Tim Cook about a larger stock buyback, sending the company's shares to a near seven-month high. He had told Cook that he should return a large amount of the company's cash reserves to shareholders. Icahn did not say how many shares he has amassed. Rules require investors to disclose stakes of five per cent or larger within 10 days of hitting that threshold. 'Had a nice conversation with Tim Cook today. Discussed my opinion that a larger buyback should be done now,' Icahn tweeted. 'We plan to speak again shortly.' 'We currently have a large position in Apple. We believe the company to be extremely undervalued.' The billionaire with a reputation for pushing aggressive corporate . change said on Twitter he planned to talk more with Cook, who has . presided over a sharp fall in the share price over the past year.

Apple has for a long time been the darling of the technology market, with the phenomenal success of its products. Last September shares were priced at $700 each but this was at $400 in June after the markets were spooked because it appeared they lacked a new dynamite product. The boost yesterday is in stark contrast with the fortunes of rival BlackBerry. It has put itself up for sale as the struggling smartphone maker seeks to revive the fortunes of its ailing brand. The handset revolutionised mobile phone technology when it was introduced in 1999 but its popularity was badly dented by the launch of Apple's iPhone in 2007 and has since lost out to Android phones as well as Microsoft's Windows device. The Canadian handset maker has failed to lure consumers to buy its BlackBerry 10 devices, which were meant to reverse the fortune of the company.","Carl Icahn told his 40,000 followers: 'We have a large position in Apple'

It comes after police put an appeal for information on the wanted teenager on Facebook, and Greenwood replied, saying: ‘Catch me if you can.’ But . the officers had the last laugh when they arrested Sam Greenwood just . 12 hours later...and added their own riposte: ‘Caught you. Do not pass . Go, do not collect £200, go straight to jail.’ Greenwood, from Rochdale, was sentenced . to four months in a Young Offenders’ Institute in January after his . driving conviction. He was freed on licence, but failed to . attend mandatory appointments at Rochdale Probation Service and a man hunt for his arrest was launched. Officers . from Greater Manchester Police put out an appeal on the official GMP . Rochdale North Facebook page, alongside Greenwood’s photograph. The . next day Greenwood wrote underneath: ‘Catch me if you can.’ Police . urged him to hand himself in, posting: ‘You are a talented young man. Don’t waste your life away. So many people are willing to help you – but . you’ve got to start helping yourself.’ Greenwood failed to heed their advice, but was spotted by officers out on patrol and placed back behind bars on June 26. They . then returned to Facebook to respond a second time: ‘Caught you. Do not . pass Go, do not collect £200, go straight to jail.’ On Wednesday, he was sentenced at Bury magistrates court after previously pleading guilty to failing to comply with the conditions of his licence, two counts of vehicle interference, taking a vehicle without consent, attempted burglary and car theft. Greenwood was matched to the crimes after leaving a trail of blood and fingerprints. While in custody he also admitted to 32 other offences, including theft from a motor vehicle and vehicle interference, which were taken into consideration. Defending, Asim Ali said: 'What's . happened in the immediate past is that when he's gone to probation, . police have gone and arrested him and taken him into custody for a . number of days. 'There is a pattern of this and because of that he's stopped going.' Caught you: The GMP Rochdale North page showed 59 people 'liked' Greenwood's 'Catch me if u can' comment .

Guilt-ridden thieves who stole a £20,000 custom-made wheelchair from quadruple amputee French swimmer Philippe Croizon have returned it. Mr Croizon was staying with family at a house in northern France when a trailer containing his wheelchair was stolen. But the Frenchman who was the first quadruple amputee to swim across the English Channel was reunited with his wheelchair today. It was left by the thieves in a car park on Friday and found by the driver of a bus for handicapped people. 'He only called me on Monday evening to tell me about it, after watching a report on this case' on French television, Mr Croizon told AFP. The 44-year-old, whose limbs were . amputated after he suffered a freak 20,000 volt accident in 1994, had previously appealed for its return. 'They haven't just stolen my wheelchair, they've stolen my autonomy,' Mr Croizon said after the theft of the wheelchair and its trailer. 'I feel sad and angry,' he said. 'Let them keep the trailer if they want, but at least give back the wheelchair.' Last year Mr Croizon made history by swimming across four intercontinental channels. He is only the second person to swim the Bering Strait. American long-distance swimmer Lynne Cox was the first to swim the route . in 1987. Croizon became a quadruple amputee . when he was severely electrocuted by a 20,000 volt charge while he . attempted to install a television antenna on his roof in 1994. Bereft: 'They haven't just stolen my wheelchair, they've stolen my autonomy,' said Mr Croizon . It is . believed the first shock stopped his heart beating, while the second . actually jolted it back into action and saved his life. Over a period of several months surgeons attempted to save his limbs but were eventually forced to amputate his arms and legs. A . keen sportsman prior to his accident Croizon spent months in hospital . followed by years of physical re-education. He has battled depression . and despondency to return to the world of sporting achievement.

Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly were spending the summer working . in bars and clubs around the Mediterranean. But now they are facing up to 25 years in jail if convicted. The girls' families are today preparing to fly to the country. Hell: The notorious Santa Monica women's prison in Lima where the girls could end up if convicted . Santa Monica women's prison on the outskirts of Lima, Peru, where it is believed British teen Melissa Reid, 19, and Irish hostess Michaela McCollum Connolly could spend as long as one year awaiting trial . Santa Monica prison is overcrowded and known to some of South America's most dangerous female criminals . Former counsel general in Lima, Michael Russell, said Peruvian jails are 'pretty dour and horrible'. 'It's all a matter of money, quite . frankly. You have to buy your space, you have to buy your food. If you . don't have money you suffer quite a lot.' Miss . Reid and Miss McCollum Connolly were arrested last Tuesday after . officers say they found more than 11kg of the Class A drug in their suitcases as . they checked in for a 6,000-mile flight back to Spain. The Foreign Office is said to be providing assistance to the girls but according to the guard they have had no visitors. Shock: The parents of Melissa Reid have yet to come to terms with their daughter's arrest saying they had no idea she had even left the island of Ibiza . Unsure future: Melissa and Michaella are currently held in prison in Lima, Peru . Shocked: Melissa Reid's parents William and Debra said they are struggling to come to terms with the news. They thought their daughter was still in Ibiza . Miss Reid left her job as a sales assistant at Next and travelled to Ibiza in June. Her mother Debra, 53, said she had been stunned to discover her daughter was no longer there. She . said: ‘As far as we knew, Melissa was in Ibiza. That is where she has . been. She met the other girl out in Ibiza. I don’t know anything else . about her.’ Speaking . from the family’s £400,000 detached home in Lenzie, near Glasgow, her . 53-year-old father William added: ‘We are just trying to come to terms . with it and we don’t really know anything.’ The family were unsure what to do. ‘If it was in Spain, it would be easier to jump on a plane out there to . be close to her, but Peru is a lot further away,’ he said.

They . say they did not know the aspiring model from Belfast had left the . popular Ibizan party town of San Antonio, where she had been working . occasionally as a nightclub hostess since June. But Spanish police say Miss McCollum Connolly had not been formally reported missing. Her mother Nora said: ‘We have been . speaking to Michaella. It’s a very difficult time.

Radio 4 listeners could be forgiven for thinking they had tuned in to the wrong station this week. Instead of the usual round-up of the day’s politics, they were confronted by a graphic discussion of pornography and sex. To replace Today in Parliament, which is off air during the summer recess, the BBC aired the first instalment of a ten-part series called Summer Nights, featuring explicit discussions of swinging, orgasms, and sex toys. To replace Today in Parliament, which is off air during the summer recess, the BBC aired the first instalment of a ten-part series called Summer Nights, featuring explicit discussions of swinging, orgasms, and sex toys . And the broadcaster caused further outrage with a 15-minute drama, aired at 10.45am, which focused on a married man who discovers he is gay by using pornographic websites. Listeners complained the scheduling was ‘completely inappropriate’ yesterday, branding Summer Nights a ‘porno You and Yours’ after the station’s regular consumer affairs programme. Opening the show, at 11pm on Monday, Woman’s Hour presenter Jane Garvey told listeners it would be different to their usual fare, saying it would contain a ‘frank discussion of sex and sexual behaviour’. She added: ‘If that isn’t what you want to hear now then you can switch off and re-join Radio 4 at midnight for the news.’ An ‘expert’ panel – including a ‘sex activist’ and a psychotherapist – then began discussing masturbation and sexual positions, while drinking red wine. One panellist claimed people experience pleasure during rape while another described violent sexual fantasies. Listeners were also given a detailed account of what to expect in a ‘vanilla’ porn film – with Susie Orbach, 66, explaining how the women would be ‘waxed’ before sex. The psychotherapist then described a sex craze among young people called ‘mag and bag’ in which a woman’s face is covered during sex while her partner looks at a woman in a magazine instead. Benedict Garrett, a self-described ‘sex activist’ branded pornography ‘democratic’. The 33-year-old, who also works as a male escort and stripper, said: ‘Porn democratises the human body way more than any mainstream media does. The BBC received four official complaints about the programme and listeners took to Twitter in outrage, calling it 'awful' ‘In the sense that if you type into a Google search engine disabled porn, porn with fat people, porn with midgets, porn with people who are missing a limb, you can find it.’ He went on to discuss his work as a prostitute, saying he had once slept with a 40-year-old virgin and giving details of what sexual positions they had tried. The BBC received four official complaints about the programme and listeners took to Twitter in outrage, calling it ‘awful’. One wrote: ‘Driving home at 11pm listening to Radio 4 as usual … but it’s all about sex! Shocking – don’t they know we’re British!’ Another added: ‘I don’t want them to discuss sex on Radio 4 any more than I want to discuss it with my mum.’ The BBC was also criticised for airing the drama How To Have A Perfect Marriage at 10.45am on Radio 4 despite its adult content. The short play featured a  wife who discovers her husband uses the internet to procure gay sex. The character also finds out her mother has bought Viagra for her father. One listener, Jean Howell, said: ‘This content is totally inappropriate for this time of the morning and I had to turn the radio off so the little ones in my house did not get upset … Do the producers of these programmes not have children? There should be a watershed on radio for adult content.’ The drama received five official complaints. A BBC spokesman said programmes were ‘commissioned and scheduled with audience expectations in mind’. He added: ‘The Woman’s Hour drama often tackles challenging issues and Summer Nights is a late night discussion programme covering numerous topics – and in both instances the nature of the content was clearly flagged to listeners before broadcast so that they could decide whether to continue listening.’","Summer Nights featured explicit talk of swinging, orgasms, and sex toys .

Joan Edwards’s solicitors yesterday tried to clear themselves of any blame over the spinster’s bequest to the nation finding its way into party coffers. West Country solicitors Davis Wood initially refused to comment on the case for reasons of ‘client confidentiality’ but then produced an ambiguous statement. It said: ‘At the time of the instructions received from the late Miss Edwards, the solicitor specifically checked with Miss Edwards about the unusual nature of her proposed bequest and it was confirmed by Miss Edwards at the time of her instructions that her estate was to be left to whichever political party formed the Government at the date of her death.’ Peter Wood, partner at Davis Wood Solicitors, the firm which drew up Joan Edwards's will in 2001 . This statement again failed to provide any evidence that Miss Edwards intended to make a generous gift to the Tories and Lib Dems. Richard Roberts, who chairs the Law Society’s wills and equity committee, said: ‘Wills are construed extremely tightly and I have now seen a copy of Miss Edwards’s will. It does say quite specifically “for whichever government” . . . it does not say “for which political party shall form the government”. ‘If that’s what Miss Edwards intended, the solicitors writing the will should have said that. They didn’t.’ Asked if the verbal clarification secured by the executors trumped what was written down, Mr Roberts said: ‘No. The will is crystal-clear on the face of it. ‘Solicitors who prepare wills know . perfectly well they have to avoid ambiguity. It is regrettable but it . appears they did not actually interpret her instructions clearly.’ Miss . Edwards died last year and had no husband or children. Her will was . drawn up by the Bristol-based firm run by experienced partners James . Davis and Peter Wood. On Tuesday afternoon, after obtaining a copy of . the will, the Mail rang Davis Wood and was put through to Mr Wood. He . declined to comment, on the basis of ‘confidentiality’, so the Mail . emailed a series of questions asking who was responsible for . interpreting the will as meaning she wanted her money to go to . ‘political parties’. Miss Edwards died last year and had no husband or children . Mr Wood again declined to comment, citing the same professional reason. The political parties, on the other hand, had no such qualms. By late afternoon, as the buck was being passed frantically around Whitehall, a consensus was emerging that it must surely be all the fault of the executors. Former midwife Joan Edwards dedicated her life to public service and then left £520,000 as a gift to the nation when she died. Here is how the Government could put her money to use within her beloved NHS: . Sources at the Lib Dems and the Tories were actively briefing against the small West Country firm. Both parties maintained the first they had heard of Joan Edwards was when the solicitors phoned up with the welcome news she had left them some money. The Lib Dems insisted: ‘The decision to give the money to political parties was taken solely by the executors of the will.’ A Tory spokesman added: ‘The solicitors for the deceased informed the Conservative Party that it was a beneficiary of the will.’ By yesterday morning, heavyweights on all sides of the political spectrum were urging that the money be repaid, and by 11am, the Lib Dems and Tories had announced they were giving up their windfalls. The will was drafted on September 17, 2001, without mentioning political parties at all. Instead, it stated she wanted her money to go to ‘whichever government is in office at the date of my death for the government in their absolute discretion to use as they may think fit’. Edward Fraser, a wills specialist at London solicitors Colemans CTTS, added: ‘It seems to be very ambiguous and unusual how it was drafted by the solicitor. It is very woolly. ‘I would not have approached it like this. If she gave these instructions, they should have been crystalised in a “letter of wishes”, so her executors had proper guidance.’ The Mail asked Davis Wood solicitors whether anything had been put in writing at the time, among a series of further questions yesterday, but has yet to receive a reply.","Davis Wood Solicitors drew up Joan Edwards's will in 2001 .

Drivers are having to put up with a 'Jekyll and Hyde' attitude to petrol pricing based on their location, the AA has warned. Some towns are charging far more for petrol and diesel than others and there are even 'pump price dogfights' within some cities, the AA said. It warned that motorists were charged more when there was no competition between retailers in some locations. However, motorists lucky to be in a location with plenty of fuel suppliers could paid less because retailers would competitively drop their prices to lure in sales. It reported that the surge in UK petrol prices had slowed but the current average price, at 137.52p a litre, was still 1.74p a litre higher than a month ago. The AA said: 'The average hides the Jekyll-and-Hyde nature of UK fuel pricing, where prices in some towns have gone up substantially more - some places passing on the full 5p-a-litre lift in wholesale prices during early July. 'This has forced drivers in communities of tens of thousands of people to pay above-average prices for the cheapest petrol locally, even at the supermarket. 'Cheapest petrol at 137.9p a litre is common in many small market and coastal towns.' The AA went on: 'The presence of a competitive retailer is dividing some cities. Some towns are charging far more for petrol and diesel than others and there are even 'pump price dogfights' within some cities . The AA warned the presence of a competitive retailer is dividing some cities . 'In Exeter (in Devon), a supermarket and . two non-supermarket retailers on the west side engaged in a pump price . dogfight at the start of this week, charging 132.9p for petrol. 'To the east of the city, without a competitive rival, supermarkets were charging 134.9p and 135.9p a litre. 'In neighbouring towns Dawlish and Crediton, supermarket petrol cost 136.9p.' The AA said the average cost of diesel has risen from 140.24p a litre in mid-July to 141.87 now. Diesel now costs nearly 1.5p more than a year ago. Regionally, London has reinforced its position as the area of the UK with the cheapest average price for petrol, at 136.9p a litre. This is 1.5p lower than Northern Ireland (138.4p) which is the most expensive region. Scotland, averaging 142.7p a litre, pays the most for diesel while the East Midlands shares the cheapest slot with Yorkshire and Humberside, both averaging 141.4p. AA public affairs head Paul Watters said: 'Recent wholesale price falls and evidence of individual non-supermarket retailers undercutting the superstores suggest the UK fuel price climate is cooling enough for some welcome respite for drivers. 'It's probably too soon to expect a price war to break out, but a bit of late summer pump relief for holiday motorists wouldn't go amiss - so long as it isn't restricted to towns with competitive supermarkets.'","'Jekyll and Hyde' pricing means fuel costs surge in some towns .

Soft drinks giant Red Bull has accused a little-known UK microbrewery of infringing its trademark and has demanded it change its name. The energy drinks firm has sent Norwich-based Redwell Brewing - which only started trading in October and employs just eight staff - a threatening letter insisting it could not use the word 'red' because it owned the trademark. The Austrian company also objected to the second part of the name 'well' because it ends with the same two letters as 'bull'. Scroll down for video . Redwell Brewery: The directors of the microbrewery in Norwich, left to right Amy Hancock, Patrick Fisher, Benjamin Thompson and Michael Baxter . The stage has been set for a classic David Vs Goliath battle as Redwell looks to defend its name against a firm that employs 9,000 people, turned over €4.25 billion last year, and whose products are sold in 161 different countries. Finance director Benjamin Thompson . said: 'It's quite worrying. The reason for their response to our . trademark is ridiculous really. 'Their . stance is completely unfair and unreasonable. It's quite concerning . when you've got a massive company trying to get you to do something you . shouldn't have to do. 'Our brands are completely different and we're not trying to infringe their brand in any way.' Newcomer: The brewery only started trading in October . The trouble flared up about two months ago when Redwell applied to trademark its name. Red Bull was alerted to the matter and brand . enforcement manager Hansjorg Jeserznik wrote to the owners of the small . brewery in Bracondale near County Hall ordering them to withdraw the . application. In the letter, Mr Jeserznik, accused Redwell's application . of compromising Red Bull's earlier trademark 'red' which would confuse the public. His letter read: 'Furthermore the term ""bull"" and the term ""well"" share the same ending and just differ in two letters. 'The ending ""ll"" is identical and . therefore the terms Red Bull and Redwell are confusingly similar from a . visual as well from a phonetical point of view.' He added: 'Consumers ... will . easily consider the sign ""Redwell"" as a line extension under ""Red Bull"", . in particular that the goods and services offered under ""Redwell"" and . ""Red Bull"" are coming from the same undertaking. 'The consumer will thus be confused as to the origin of the services.' Threatening legal action unless Redwell obeyed its demand, Mr Jeserznik argued that the trademark would 'take unfair advantage of, dilute and . tarnish the Red Bull trademarks'. Redwell Brewing was founded by directors Patrick Fisher, Benjamin Thompson, Michael Baxter and Amy Hancock. And they have vowed to fight the global firm, saying they have already ratcheted up 'thousands of pounds' in legal fees. Mr Thompson said: 'We called ourselves Redwell after Redwell Street in Norwich. It was not just some random name we picked out of thin air. Cheers: Mr Thompson and Ms Hancock raise a glass despite legal worries brought on by global giant Red Bull . 'Patrick and Amy are part-owners of the Norwich Tap House in Redwell Street, and our beers are sold there. 'The name of Red Bull never came up . at all when we were discussing what to call the brewery. I cannot see . that there would be any confusion between Red Bull and Redwell. 'For a start, Red Bull is two words and Redwell is one, and then the second words are different. We are different names, brands, designs and products.' Mr Thompson explained after some . initial legal wrangling, Red Bull agreed to let them keep using the . name Redwell on its existing products, but demanded any new lines it . introduces and branding such as T-shirts be given a different name. What's in a name: The firm are refusing to rebrand and say they have already clocked up thousands of pounds in legal fees . He added: 'A lot of hard work has gone into developing our brand. The design on our bottles and other merchandise was created by third year graphic designers at Norwich University of the Arts. 'It would be catastrophic for us now to have to go back to the drawing board to find another name.' Mr Fisher said: 'It seems like an over-the-top reaction. As a small, innovative brewery, it's quite worrying to have this thing hanging over our heads, when we are looking to move the business forward. Redwell supplies craft beer to pubs . in Norwich and London and is expanding to sell across the country to . Edinburgh, Glasgow, Newcastle and Manchester. It produces 3,000 litres of beer every week, has been selling beer for about five months, and employs eight people. Confusion: Redwell say Red Bull never even crossed their minds when they were devising their name, and their name was taken from the street where they also run a pub . It claims to be the first brewery to brew its own lager in Norwich for more than 30 years. Founded in 1984, Red Bull employed 8,966 people in 165 countries by the end of last year as its top product rules and dominates the global energy drinks industry. Mr Thompson said they had now replied to Red Bull's request and were trying hard to find a reasonable solution without giving up their name. A Red Bull spokesman said the company did not comment on pending cases.","Red Bull has demanded a tiny brewery called Redwell change its name .

When Karen Griggs’ handbag, stuffed with £5,000 in cash, went missing she reported it to the police. But she soon gave up hope that the bag – or the money - would ever be found. Now the bag has been found exactly where she had forgotten she left it, on a peg in a church in Devon, six years after she reported it missing. And even more miraculously, all the money was still there. The 47-year-old said: 'I feel so stupid. I must have left it in the church but obviously I didn’t realise that, and I reported it stolen to the police. 'I thought it had been stolen from my home. It is crazy that I have got the money back after all this time. 'I can’t believe that it’s just been . hanging on the same peg where I left it in the same holdall with my bank . cash card in it, exactly where I must have left it. 'It is an amazing story but I feel embarrassed. I used to go into a lot of churches in Brixham to pray at the time and I don’t even know which one found it. 'I would like to know so that I can give a donation to church funds to thank them.' US-born Mrs Griggs had been on her way to the bank to change the money into dollars ahead of a trip back to her place of birth in 2007, when she had popped into a church and absentmindedly left it there. Puzzled police in Brixham have described its sudden and unexpected reappearance as 'one in a million'. The money was so old that the notes were out-of-date and had to be replaced by the Bank of England. Brixham PC Tim Perrin said: 'The church couldn’t say how long it had been there before they looked . inside and found all these bundles of £20 notes. 'A very nice lady from the church came and handed it in to Brixham police station. 'We did some research and discovered that it had been reported stolen in 2007 from a Brixham home. 'In all my experience as a policeman . this is a one in a million. It is very strange. A cash card was still . with it and that’s how we traced it back. Honest: The money was found at a church in the quaint Devonshire town of Brixham . 'The people at the church are very modest about what they did in returning it and don’t want any publicity. 'The owner wanted to thank them for their honesty but they want to remain anonymous.' Mrs Griggs hit the headlines in 2009 for . another case of forgetfulness when she left her keys in her car and a . thief stole it.

Thousands of protesters demanding the resignation of Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy demonstrated in Madrid and Barcelona last night. They took to the streets to call on Rajoy, the leader of the Popular Party who has been Prime Minister since 2011, to stand down over claims he took money from a government slush-fund. What started as a peaceful event turned violent when riot police clashed with some protesters, leaving many people from both sides injured. Scroll down for video . There were violent clashes in Madrid last night after proteters called for Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy to resign . Last night's protest had not been expected and saw thousands of people marching in the Spanish capital . The protesters packed the streets outside the Madrid headquarters of Rajoy's Popular Party, insisting that he should leave office because of allegations he received payoffs from a slush fund before his party won elections in 2011. They marched through the city in demonstrations that had not been expected but began peacefully. Shortly before midnight, groups of protesters in Madrid's Plaza de Cibeles clashed with police wielding batons.  The protesters charged the police on several occasions and were beaten back by officers. Those injured included a police officer hurt by a flying projectile and a protestor with a bloodied face, while some of the protesters were arrested by authorities. The demonstrations came after opposition leaders this week called for Rajoy to explain himself before Parliament or face a censure vote. Critics of the 58-year-old politician said he should resign after text messages emerged showing him comforting a former political party treasurer under investigation over a slush fund and secret Swiss bank accounts. Shortly before midnight, protesters and riot police clashed, leaving people on both sides bloodied and hurt . Riot police fought back when protesters charged them as the demonstration turned violent . The treasurer has claimed Rajoy took under-the-counter payments, accusations denied by Rajoy who has brushed off the calls for him to stand down. The scandal first emerged in January when Spanish newspaper El Pais published copies of account ledgers purportedly showing irregular payments to top party members. Further leaks of supposed statements implicated the grey-bearded premier himself. The spectacle of alleged greed and corruption has enraged Spaniards who are already suffering with austerity measures and sky-high unemployment.

Hundreds of workers were left stranded and in tears yesterday after they were called to their company head office, unexpectedly made redundant and then told they could not use their company cars to get home. Sales representatives for telephone directory Thomson Local received a mysterious email late on Tuesday afternoon ordering them to attend a meeting at head office at noon yesterday. They drove from across the country to Farnborough, Hampshire, where they were ushered into two rooms – and half were told they had lost their jobs because the company had gone into administration. Account representative Jocelyn Green, 57, from Chelmsford, Essex, pictured left, is worried about paying her mortgage,  while Emma Foulds, 23, from Bath, right, said there had been no warning of the job losses . About 200 workers were made redundant. Some had worked for the firm for 27 years. Parents were told to remove child equipment before handing over company cars as well as company mobile phones, leaving them stranded and unable to contact friends and relatives. They were left to return home on public transport to places such as Devon, Leeds, Manchester and North Wales. Emma Foulds, 23, from Bath, said there had been no warning of the job losses. She said: ‘We knew that the company was up for sale, so people thought the meeting was because we had new owners who wanted to introduce themselves. ‘But as soon as we walked into the room there was no senior management and people we did not recognise, [the] administrators.’ Miss Foulds said: ‘People started crying, there are a lot of pregnant people who are not going to get maternity leave, pensions may have gone. It is disgusting how they have dealt with it.’ Employees drove from across the country to the office in Farnborough, Hampshire, pictured, where they were ushered into two rooms and half were told they had lost their jobs .

She said: ‘I have worked for Thomson since July 1986 and have worked tirelessly for them. ‘I have been noticed as one of the top three reps in the country, never missing a sale or a target. When I got the email I thought it could be a buyout, but this is crazy. ‘To travel 86 miles to get here and be told: “Sorry, you don’t have a job” is a terrible way to be treated. ‘I was crying my eyes out in the meeting.

Now teenagers in the city will be taught how to cook the home-grown balti as part of a plan to tackle youth unemployment. Responding to the demands of locals business and high unemployment, the cooking lessons will form part of the Birmingham Baccalaureate, a course to run alongside GCSEs and aimed at providing skills needed to meet the needs of city employers. Key skills: Students in Birmingham will learn how to cook the city's famous balti dish from September to plug lacking local skills. Zafar Hussain, pictured, from Shabab restaurant, in the 'Balti Triangle' was filmed demonstrating how it's done to be shown during the lessons . Famous for its tomato-based dish, the . city's 'Balti Triangle' region is home to scores of curry houses and . takeaways - forming a major employment sector in the city. During research, local businesses including restauranteurs highlighted gaps in the skills of young people starting work, and a curriculum aimed at plugging those gaps has been developed. From September, 10 schools in Birmingham will be teaching teenagers not only how to cook a curry, but also skills around digital data storage, engineering, life sciences and hospitality. Teachers from the schools developed the cookery lesson with help from the Birmingham Balti Association and Zafar Hussain from Shabab curry house, which sits in the 'Balti Triangle'. Andy Munro, chairman of the association, said: 'The balti is something Birmingham is very famous for. When it came about almost 30 years ago, nobody realised this one-pot cooking method would become so iconic. 'It was the first bit of fusion . cooking over here, a new take on the traditional curry introduced by a . Pakistani restaurateur on the Ladypool Road.'

He said the lesson will show young people how to make the city's signature dish, helping to 'continue the balti’s legacy through to the next generation'. He . added: 'It’s important that schools teach a wide range of skills and, . more specifically, skills that will guarantee youngsters jobs in their . home city.' Dr Nicki Senior, programme director . for the Birmingham Baccalaureate, said: 'We already have 10 schools on . board and many others have shown support for the award. 'Putting curry on the curriculum is . just the tip of the iceberg, we want school leavers to have a deeper . understanding of their city and what employers in the region need.' The Birmingham Baccalaureate is framed . around the young average age of people in the city: in contrast to the . national and regional picture, there are more children than pensioners . (22 per cent are children aged 0 to 15 years). As well as a higher proportion of young people, they are more likely to be unemployed than their peers in other UK cities. Ingredients for the Birmingham Balti: . The finished product . vegetable oil . 2 chopped tomatoes . 1 small finely chopped onion . 1 diced chicken breast de-boned . 1 teaspoon of garam masala . I tablespoon of ginger and garlic puree . pinch of fenugreek . pinch of paprika . pinch of turmeric . pinch of cumin . 2 small green chillies chopped . freshly chopped coriander . Birmingham MP Gisela Stuart, said: 'We are the fastest growing young city in Europe and, in contrast to the national and regional picture, have more children than pensioners.

Exposed: Dressed in his finery, Thomas Lee Hornsby's wife discovered he was a bigamist after seeing this picture of his second wedding on Facebook . A husband was exposed as a bigamist after his wife saw photographs of his second wedding on Facebook. Thomas Lee Hornsby, from Sunderland, split with his first wife in February 2011 after an affair with Joanne Henderson, who he then married without getting a divorce. Hornsby, who has bipolar disorder, wed again in a ceremony on April 4 this year but his crime was revealed shortly afterwards after he posted pictures online. The 37-year-old, from Sunderland, was exposed by his first wife after she spotted the images of him and Ms Henderson celebrating with guests. Sunderland Magistrates' Court heard that Hornsby, from Pallion, Sunderland, had lied to a city registrar about being married when planning his new nuptuals. Rebecca Laverick, prosecuting, said: 'A registrar at Sunderland Civic Centre said that she had had a meeting with the defendant and his new wife prior to the wedding ceremony. 'She said that they met on February 26 and went through the formalities. 'She questioned him about whether or not he had been previously married and he said no.' A decree nisi was put in place in May 2012, but was not made absolute. In trouble: Hornsby lied to the staff at the Sunderland Civic Centre (pictured) about still being married, and was sentenced today . Hornsby's first wife contacted the police after seeing the photographs of her husband with his new bride. Caught: The 37-year-old's first wife said she was 'shocked' about the pictures especially as they were never divorced after they split in 2011 . She said she was 'shocked and embarrassed' to find out about the deception via Facebook. Hornsby admitted in a police interview that he had gone ahead with the ceremony knowing he was still married. He had also pleaded guilty to the charge of bigamy at an earlier hearing. Gavin Sword, defending, said: 'There was no financial gain in this case and no immigration issues. 'I don't think it (the wedding) can have come as any great surprise. They had been in a relationship for at least a year at this point. 'Whilst there was a deception to the registrar, I don't think there was to either of the two ladies in this case.' Hornsby's marriage to Ms Henderson was deemed void after the deception was uncovered. Magistrates sentenced him to eight weeks in prison, suspended for six months. Sentencing Hornsby, chairman of the bench Eric Reay said: 'The reason for this is the deliberate deception you put about in the lead up to your second marriage. 'You deceived the registrar, you deceived your first wife and your new wife. 'This was deliberate.'","Thomas Lee Hornsby wed Joanne Henderson in April while still married .

Wine should be watered down to preserve the health of middle-class drinkers, ministers have suggested. They argue that the minimum strength of ‘still wine’ should be reduced by law from 8.5 per cent alcohol-by-volume to 4.5 per cent – about a third as strong as today’s typical table wines. Earl Howe, the health minister, said the market for low- or reduced- alcohol wines has been ‘increasing rapidly’ in recent years. NHS figures show that professionals are almost twice as likely to drink heavily than those on lower income . He claimed that allowing producers to make weaker wine would be in the ‘long-term interest’ of the public, amid concern over rises in liver disease and cancers linked to alcohol consumption. NHS figures show that professionals are almost twice as likely to drink heavily than those on lower incomes. Earl Howe said the market for low- or reduced- alcohol wines has been 'increasing rapidly' in recent years . They also warn that small, regular . amounts of wine – viewed by many middle-class drinkers as a reward after . a hard day of work or looking after children – can cause long-term . problems, including liver damage and even cancer. Lord Howe told the Daily Telegraph: . ‘The Government has consistently made the case for a change to the EU . wine rules to permit reduced and de-alcoholised products to be called . wines.’ However, . critics say the suggestion will anger many wine-drinkers, who have faced . above-inflation tax rises on their tipple of choice over the past five . years. Wine producers in . the European Union have already mounted opposition to a new definition . of wines, which could include alcohol-free drinks. As a result, the latest round of negotiations over the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy failed to reach an agreement. Nevertheless, Lord Howe promised to ‘continue to work hard to bring this topic back on to the EU wine policy agenda as soon as possible’. The market for weaker wine has indeed grown in recent years. Almost seven million bottles with an alcohol content of less than 8.5 per cent were sold in Britain in 2011 – two million more than the year before. Should wine be watered down to 'protect the middle class'? Furthermore, alcohol consumption has, on average, been falling since 2004. But despite this trend, a study published last year showed that just 29 per cent of us actually pay attention to how much alcohol drinks contain. A government spokesman said yesterday: ‘We want to encourage alcohol manufacturers to make lower-alcohol alternatives; these [current] rules do not help our cause. ‘We will continue our efforts to change EU wine rules, to allow all wine producers to make and market lower-alcohol products. ‘This will help to help promote healthier choices and tackle the serious harm alcohol causes’.","Government calls for minimum strength to be cut from 8.5% to 4.5% .

The government has spent £800million calling in consultants to do the work of staff made redundant with pay-offs worth almost £300million. The revelation sparked claims Whitehall departments have ‘let good people go’ before rehiring former civil servants on expensive, temporary contracts. The spending also flies in the face of a ban on the use of external consultants as part of the government’s austerity programme. Revolving door: The government has spent almost £300million laying off staff, and up to £800million bringing in consultants . The total pay-offs in 2012-13 to core staff at the 17 main central Government departments was £290 million, Cabinet Office figures show. The data reveals the Ministry of Justice recorded a high of £89 million in exit payments for staff in 2012-13, followed by the Department of Work and Pensions' £67 million. But at the same time Whitehall departments paid out £505 million on consultants and short-term staff, listed as ‘consultancy and contingent labour’. Analysis by The Times of the data placed the overall cost of consultants and temporary staff at nearer to £800 million for the 17 main departments. It includes private firms brought in to work on projects including HS2, Universal Credit and the West Coast Main Line railway, plus more than £328 million on ‘off-payroll’ staff. Grip: Tory MP Priti Patel said ministers had to do more to control spending . Tory MP Priti Patel told The Times: Witham, said: ‘Ministers need to get a grip on consultancy and temporary staff costs. ‘Paying for these services should be the exception rather than the rule and Whitehall must restructure itself to bring these costs down.’ Bernard Jenkin, the Tory chairman of the Public Administration Select Committee, added: ‘We have let good people go as part of the downsizing - but how many of these consultants are ex-civil servants?’ In August 2012 Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office, claimed the last government used consultants as a 'comfort blanket', adding: 'If there was anything difficult to be done, they would reach for consultants immediately, which is both very expensive, but also it actually undermines the position of mainstream civil servants.’ The coalition, he added, was trying to reduce the dependence on consultants through trying to achieve a skills transfer from consultants used to civil servants, and knowing where existing skills were across Government. A Cabinet Office spokeswoman said: ‘We've already put an end to excessive consultancy spend by establishing stringent controls across Government saving, over £1.6 billion in 2011/12 compared to the level of spending in 2009/10. ‘Cabinet Office delivers projects across a wide range of high-profile policy areas. ‘It is sometimes necessary to recruit for specialist business-critical roles. Such roles are only authorised where the skills are not readily available within civil service and where using temporary labour is better value for taxpayers' money than hiring full-time staff. ‘Bringing in procurement, finance and digital expertise plays a crucial part in our determination to strengthen the corporate centre in Whitehall and ensuring that government operates like the best-run businesses.’","Whitehall accused of 'letting good people go’ before calling in consultants .

Britain’s summer heatwave triggered a surge in spending as shoppers splashed out on food, alcohol and clothes. Sales in July were 3 per cent higher than the same time last year, the biggest rise for two and a half years. Consumer confidence was boosted by the hot weather, the birth of Prince George and sporting victories including Andy Murray winning Wimbledon and the rugby Lions triumphing in Australia. Spending: Retailers report a 3 per cent increase in sales in July compared to the same time last year . Heatwave: As temperatures soared to over 30 degrees, shops saw a surge in sales . As temperatures hit 30 degrees in many parts of the country, families rushed out to stock up on barbecue essentials fuelling a 2.1 per cent year-on-year rise in food sales volumes. This increase was the highest since April 2011, with the amount spent on food rising by 5.7 per cent. ‘Feedback from supermarkets suggested that the sunny weather boosted sales across a range of products including food, alcohol, clothing and outdoor items,’ the Office for National Statistics said. Department stores saw July sales surge 3.1 per cent on a year earlier, while sales of textiles, clothing and footwear were up 1.4 per cent. Supermarkets also reported higher sales of garden furniture. Property boom: House prices are rising three times fast than wages, and in many areas have returned to their highest level since the financial crash . It is the latest sign of a growing economic recovery after employment figures yesterday showed a record number of people are now in work, hitting 29.7million. It follows a flurry of figures showing house prices at their highest level since the financial crash and manufacturing output and car production also on up. From April to June the economy grew by 0.6 per cent, double the 0.3 per cent seen in the first quarter of 2013. New Bank of England governor Mark Carney last week raised growth forecasts for this year from 1.2 per cent to 1.4 per cent and for next year from 1.7 per cent to 2.5 per cent. In July, the average amount spent each week hit £7 billion, up from £6.8billion in June 2013 and £6.7 billion in July 2012. Squeeze: Total pay rose by 2.1 per cent last month, but wage increases have been outstripped by the soaring cost of living . Economy: As thousands of people flocked to the beach during the heatwave, including Brighton, they stocked up on food, alcohol and clothing . Martin Beck, UK economist at Capital Economics, said shoppers were ‘lured outside by the sunshine’. He said: ‘With consumer confidence on the rise and continued growth in employment, the retail sector looks set fair for the third quarter, even as the boost from the weather fades.’ Month on month, there were dips in sales volumes across department stores and textile, clothing and footwear retailers, but supermarket sales grew 2.5 per cent. James Knightley, economist at ING Bank, said the retail sales data suggests a ‘decent increase’ in GDP in the third quarter. But he added that, with the economy also creating jobs, interest rate hikes are likely to come much sooner than late 2016 as implied by the Bank. The data tallies with recent official figures which showed steep discounting by fashion retailers helped drive a drop in consumer price index (CPI) inflation, to 2.8 per cent in July from 2.9 per cent a month earlier. And it suggests Britain's high streets are recovering after a weather-hit start to the year and five years of economic malaise. Shoppers' migration to the internet continued, with the average weekly amount spent online rising 10.7 per cent to £586.6 million. The amount spent online accounted for 9.5 per cent of all retail spending excluding automotive fuel.","Total sales in July up 3% on the same time last year, ONS reveals .

There was hair-pulling, spitting, and fisticuffs at the school gates – and that was just the parents. Two young mothers have been found guilty of assault after an unseemly brawl outside their children’s school in south London. As Kelly Giles was waiting to pick up her child from Merton Abbey Primary School, she was confronted by Keyleigh Gore, who claimed she had called her 'fat' and insulted her daughter.

Gore, 25, pushed Miss Giles who fell back on to a low level wall and then started repeatedly punching her. Fisher, who initially tried to break up the pair, then assaulted Miss Giles by pushing her in the shoulder and then hitting her in the face. Miss Giles was left with extensive bruising to her lower back, arms and above her left eye as a result of the attack. Both Keyleigh Gore and Sasha Fisher were hauled before magistrates today following the childish spat outside Merton Abbey Primary School on March 12 this year. Gore, from Wimbledon, South London, admitted she had pushed Miss Giles in order to 'get her off her' after the two became embroiled in a hair-pulling tussle, she claimed. Sasha Fisher, 21, claimed that she initially tried to break up the fight but later hit Miss Giles in the face in 'self defence' Fisher, 21, who lives on the same estate as her accomplice, said she had broken up the two women and that she had later hit Miss Giles in the face with her palm only because she had feared for her safety. After a three-hour trial, both were found guilty of assault by beating after their claims of self-defence were rejected by officials at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court. John Brummell, chairman of the bench, said it was clear that the injuries suffered by Miss Giles were as a result of the two beatings dolled out by the other women.

His wife liked the photograph of them signing the marriage register so much that she posted it on Facebook for all their friends to see. Unfortunately for Joynson – who was pocketing hundreds of pounds in benefits claiming he was single and living alone – the local council saw the picture too. Guilty: Smiling as he signs the marriage register, this is the picture that got 'single' Heath Joynson caught by fraud investigators . The 45-year-old, who was receiving housing and council tax handouts, was found to be living with his wife, who had a job. North Staffordshire Magistrates heard he had falsely claimed benefits totalling £1,241. Joynson started claiming benefits from Stoke-on-Trent City Council in May 2010, but failed to notify it when he got married and started living with his wife. The council spotted the photograph on his wife’s Facebook page and invited him to three interviews, but he failed to attend. Lionel Desa, prosecuting, said: ‘Her Facebook profile showed  them signing a marriage register. Her profile also showed she  was employed.’ Enjoying the high life: The court heard that the couple, pictured here on holiday together, have now separated as a result of Joynson's drug use . Joynson pleaded guilty to failing to . notify a change of circumstances affecting his entitlement to benefits . between September 20, 2010, and January 9, 2011. Cheat: Heath Joynson claimed more than £1000 which he was not entitled to after tricking his council into giving him housing and council tax benefit . He also admitted stealing £519.87 worth of goods from two supermarkets, failing to surrender to bail, and failing to attend a follow-up assessment following a test for the presence of a class A drug. He was sentenced to a 12-month community order with supervision, a six-month drug rehabilitation requirement and 120 hours of unpaid work. A council spokesman said: ‘The offender tried a host of tricks and lies to avoid his responsibilities. ‘But our determined investigation team found pictures of his marriage ceremony on his wife’s Facebook page. Now he is paying the price of deception and we are sending out a strong message that we will piece together information from a range of sources and expose people who are defrauding the public purse.’ The court heard that Joynson’s wife left him five months ago because he started using heroin. A man has been convicted of bigamy after his wife found a photograph on Facebook of him marrying another woman. Thomas Hornsby, 37, of Sunderland, separated from his first wife in February 2011 after starting an affair with Joanne Henderson. He started divorce proceedings but they were never formalised and he wed his new lover in a ceremony on April 4 this year. Sunderland magistrates sentenced him to eight weeks in prison, suspended for six months.","Heath Joynson, 45, stole more than £1,000 in benefits he was not entitled to .

Tragic: It was claimed Sadie Anne Jayne McGrady may have had less severe injuries if repairs not not been substandard . A six-year-old girl died in a car that had been written-off after a previous crash then welded together in a 'botched repair job', a coroner's court has heard. Sadie Anne Jayne McGrady, from Mostyn, in north Wales, died from severe head injuries on the A548 in Flintshire, on July 22 last year. Sadie’s mother Catherine Barlow had attempted to drive across two lanes of a dual carriageway when they were hit at about 11.20am. Mark Buckley, from Ashton under Lyme, said he was overtaking vehicles on the dual carriageway eastbound, at about 60-65mph, when Miss Barlow’s car suddenly appeared in front of him. He slammed on the brakes but could not avoid a collision. Miss Barlow’s car was shunted into the opposite carriageway and when off-duty nurse Leonie Lewis went to help the occupants Miss Barlow said to her: 'I’m so sorry. What have I done?' When interviewed, she said she had waited for one car to pass, seen Mr Buckley’s car approaching about 200 metres away and thought she had enough time to cross to the central reservation. But substandard repairs carried out to the silver Vauxhall Corsa following a 2008 insurance write-off may have resulted in Sadie having greater injuries than may otherwise have been expected, a vehicle examiner told the court. At an inquest into her death yesterday, Sadie’s father John Paul McGrady paid a moving tribute to his daughter. A statement read to the court in Ruthin said: 'Sadie enjoyed good health. She was full of life. 'Her passing has had a massive, devastating effect on our lives.' 'It has left a massive hole that can never be filled.' Sadie’s sister Megan who was five spent time in intensive care but has since recovered. The scene where the six-year-old died last year. According to an expert inadequate welding had been carried out on one of the car's panels . Floral tributes were left at the scene where Sadie died in Flintshire . Evidence read out by Mr Gittins on behalf of vehicle examiner Gary Roberts said 'very sub-standard repairs' had been carried out on the side panels of the car next to where Sadie had been sitting. If a car is written off by an insurance company, they will usually tell DVLA so that a ‘VIC marker’ (Vehicle Identity Check marker) can be put on the vehicle record. To remove the VIC marker the car needs to pass a VIC test and if it passes it is okay to drive. The VIC test compares the details DVLA has about the car against the car itself. It takes place at a VOSA (Vehicle and Operator Services Agency) test centre. A spokesman from the DVLA said: 'When insurers notify us of vehicles on which they have made total loss payments a marker is set against the vehicle record and the vehicle registration document is destroyed. 'No further documents will be issued on such vehicles until a Vehicle Identity Check has been conducted to confirm the identity of the vehicle and have a current MoT if required.' 'There was a severe broadside impact to the offside of the vehicle,' he said. 'The consequence of a previous sub-standard repair undoubtedly caused greater intrusion of the side panel. 'Inadequate welding had been done to reinstate the quarter panel. 'There is an increased likelihood of the occupants sustaining greater injury, although I do not know by how much.' Seven people, including two of Sadie’s cousins, were injured in the two car crash on the A548 in the village of Gwespyr, North Wales. The girls’ grieving parents  kept a round-the-clock vigil at Sadie's sister's bedside while she lay in intensive care. North Wales coroner John Gittins has said he will now write to vehicle and insurance associations - including the DVLA - asking for changes in the rules governing previously written off vehicles. Williams Sayner, of the North Wales Police Forensic Collision Investigation Unit, confirmed there are currently no statutory requirements regarding secondary testing of a car after it has been repaired following a write-off. He also confirmed the manner and speed of driving of the man at the wheel of the Ford Focus 'cannot be considered blameworthy in any way'. Heartbroken: Megan (left) was told the devastating news that her older sister Sadie (right) had died in the car crash . Playmates: Sadie (left) and her sister Megan (right) were inseparable. Their grieving parents escaped the crash without serious injury . Speaking to the family, Mr Gittins said: 'Sadie was the light of your life. I am very conscious of your suffering.' Evaluating post-mortem evidence he said Sadie’s death had resulted from 'a blunt force head injury as a result of a traffic collision'. He recorded a verdict of accidental death.","Sadie Anne Jane McGrady died from severe head injuries on July 22 last year .

'Digsusted': The teenagers found live maggots wriggling around inside the box at the Tesco branch in Sunderland . Teenagers buying sweets in Tesco were horrified to discover live maggots crawling around inside a box of chocolates. The two boys told how shoppers abandoned their trolleys and walked out in disgust after they found the creatures wriggling around inside a box of Cadbury's Caramel Nibbles at the store in Sunderland. 'Disgusted' Josh Downs, 18, said what he initially thought was caramel leaking from the bag turned out to be maggots dropping off the packet and onto his hands. Mr Downs, who was buying treats with his friend Braden Little ahead of a trip to the cinema, said: 'I didn't realise what it was at first - I thought it was caramel leaking out of the packet. 'I felt something move and saw the maggots on my hand and my clothes. It was disgusting. 'It absolutely stank of fungus,' Mr Downs added. 'A lady shopping in the same aisle told me to go and wash my hands straight away.' His friend Mr Little, also 18, said other shoppers at the store in Roker Avenue were 'horrified' by the grisly sight on the supermarket shelf. 'Some people just abandoned their shopping and left the store - they were as disgusted as we were,' said the teenager, from Fulwell. 'The maggots were small and slimy and were crawling around the box. 'They were absolutely horrible and they smelled really bad. 'You just don't expect it in Tesco - I definitely won't be shopping there again,' he said. Tesco has said it is investigating the incident. 'Brushed off': Braden Little, 18, was reaching for a packet of chocolate sweets at the supermarket when he realised the box was crawling with maggots . The teenagers, who will both take up places at Sunderland University in September, immediately complained to the store manager about what they had seen. But the friends say they felt the incident was not taken seriously. 'We went to the customer service desk, but they just seemed to brush us off,' Mr Little said. 'They have told us they are doing an internal investigation, but we haven't heard anything since.""

Ban: The 'e-collar', favoured by celebrities including Hollywood actress Jessica Biel, are no more effective than traditional forms of dog training . Collars that give dogs electric shocks should be outlawed immediately after Government research concluded they were no better for training dogs than traditional methods of reward. That is the view of the Kennel Club in response to two reports commissioned by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), which found they could actually cause harm to people's pets rather than change their behaviour. The devices, used by Hollywood dog whisperer Cesar Millan and actress Jessica Biel, have already been banned in Wales and pressure is now mounting on ministers to extend this to the rest of the UK. The Kennel Club is campaigning hard for action on the grounds the 'e-collars' are cruel and harmful and has written to ministers calling for action. The controversial collars can deliver a shock lasting as long as 30 seconds. Up to 500,000 British . owners are said to use them. Kennel Club secretary Caroline Kisko argued the reports, which cost £540,000, proved the devices hurt dogs and were less efficient than manufacturers claimed. She said: 'There is no denying the results of . these two surveys. 'Action needs to be taken now to prevent further harm . being done to the UK's dogs. 'Even with industry trained . professionals, and the project being conducted by an organisation (ECMA) with a clear agenda, it was still found that electric shock collars . often had a detrimental effect on dogs and did not prove to be a better . alternative than training using positive reinforcement.' She added the devices failed to address . underlying behaviour and could lead to further behaviour problems by . training a dog to respond out of . fear of further punishment rather than a natural willingness to obey. Fan: Dog Whisperer Cesar Millan uses electric shock collars to help train neglected canines, although the Kennel Club believes they are harmful . Good boy: Traditional rewards work just as well as the punishment meted out by electric shocks . DOG TRAINING SCHOOLS . In the first of the two studies, scientists at the Universities of Bristol and Lincoln, and the Food and Environment Research Agency, concluded the use of e–collars 'can lead to a negative impact on welfare at least in a proportionate (number) of animals trained using this technique'. It found that many owners used the devices without adhering to the instructions. Cruel: Electric collars, such as these pictured here, can emit shocks lasting 30 seconds . The second follow–up study was conducted by the Lincoln team in conjunction with the Electronic Collar Manufacturers Association (ECMA). It showed that the devices were no more effective than other methods of training, such as giving rewards for dogs who have problems chasing other animals, a common reason given for using shock collars. But ECMA denied that the collars caused pain, although spokeswoman Angela Critchley admitted Defra officials had been in contact with its members since the publication of the reports. She told the Telegraph: 'Defra has approached ECMA to ensure that its members' products continue to be manufactured to set standards and to further educate users on how to operate the training products responsibly.' 'ECMA members have signed up to a robust code of practice where all products meet the latest technical requirements and provide user guides with consistent instructions to improve the quality of lives of dogs while protecting animal welfare.' A spokesman for Defra said its research showed the collars 'cause no long–term harm to dog welfare when manufactured to a high standard and used appropriately' but that those using the devices 'to inflict unnecessary suffering may be prosecuted under animal welfare laws'.","Kennel Club calls for controversial electric collars to be banned immediately .

The study by the nonprofit Partnership for New York City found that commuters in the Big Apple spend an average 48 minutes getting to and from work. That's nearly 23 minutes longer than the average commute in the U.S., according to U.S.Census figures. The sheer magnitude of people flowing in and out of Manhattan every day is largely to blame for the city's lengthy commute. Commuters wait for their trains to be called at Penn Station in New York. A study by the nonprofit Partnership for New York City found that commuters in the Big Apple spend an average 48 minutes getting to and from work . New Yorkers wait in traffic as they head into Manhattan from Brooklyn. Manhattan doubles its population every work day with 1.5 million commuters . The borough doubles its population every work day with 1.5 million commuters - which is more than the populations of Phoenix, Dallas and San Francisco combined, the report points out. More than one third of those commuters are traveling from other states, while the majority come from the other four boroughs. By comparison, roughly 150,000 commuters travel between Queens and Brooklyn every day. That's a much smaller number than the amount traveling to and from Manhattan, but it's more than enough to clog the bus, train, and especially road routes between the two boroughs. The report says more than half of commuters between Brooklyn and Queens have to drive because of 'limited' public transit options. To ease congestion along those routes, the report recommends increasing bus service between the two boroughs. The report also recommends that new businesses consider locating in boroughs outside of Manhattan. Brooklyn has seen a 24 percent increase in the number of people who both live and work there over the past decade thanks to a boom in new businesses there. Similarly, the Bronx has seen a 28 percent jump in the number of people who commute there for work. 'But the borough still has a lot to do before becoming a jobs center,' the report notes. 'For every one person who commutes into the Bronx for work, four people commute out, indicating a lack of job opportunities.' The Partnership for New York City describes itself as a 'nonprofit membership organization comprised of a select group of two hundred CEOs from New York City's top corporate, investment and entreprenurial firms.' The organization says its goal is to stimulate the city's economy by contributing directly to jobs programs and serving disadvantaged communities.","The nonprofit Partnership for New York City reports that New Yorkers' commutes average 48 minutes .

Simione's employees and his estranged wife say he had become increasingly paranoid as a result of abusing steroids and had spiraled into a delusional fit, fueled by racism against blacks and Hispanics and his belief that the nation was descending into chaos, court documents allege. Police say he even went so far as to threaten President Barack Obama, saying that he should be murdered because he is a 'n*****.' Arrested: Jason Simione, 39, is accused of trying to hire a hitman to kill his beautiful wife Megumi Simione, her family and his 9-month-old son . Simione is charged with abusing his son Jett. He also allegedly wanted to have the baby killed if he didn't gain custody of him . Police seized some 68 weapons and 70,000 rounds of ammunition from Simione's home in Dania Beach, Florida. They say he was a 'survivalist' who was preparing for the end of the world . Simione allegedly began to plot his wife's murder when she told him in July that she wanted a divorce . Authorities called Simione a 'survivalist,' who was preparing for the end of civilization. They seized 68 weapons from his house and tens of thousands of rounds of ammunition, along with what they allege were parts to build pipe bombs. Simione, 39, bragged on Facebook just months ago that 'he had never been happier' after the birth of his baby Jett. He was married to a beautiful 28-year-old woman, Megumi 'May' Simione, whom he had met in Hawaii. That all changed in July when Megumi Simione said she wanted a divorce and moved out. Police say Jason Simione asked his El Salvadoran employee for help killing his estranged wife, her brother and her mother. If he didn't win custody of little Jett in the divorce, he wanted his baby killed, as well. Simione allegedly added that if the hitmen raped his wife, he wouldn't mind. He allegedly told the employee that he had already withdrawn the cash to pay for the executions. When police raided Simione's house, they found so much hardware, they had to use a shopping cart to haul it away . Simione's divorce lawyer maintains that all of the weapons - including a .50-caliber sniper rifle made to stop cars - were owned legally. Simione runs a business that supplies pouches and slings to the military . A massive .50-caliber sniper rifle, seen here being fired by Simione's estranged wife, was taken from Simione's home. The weapon is so powerful, it can crack an engine block and stop a truck . The investigation began last week when Megumi Simione called police and reported that he had thrown the couple's baby against a table in a fit of rage, leaving the child with bruises and a cut on his head. Simione's ex-wife, Tara Simione, told the South Florida Sun-Sentinel that Jason Simione - who is broad and muscular - might talk a tough, but he wouldn't hurt anyone. She said Simione believed his estranged wife Megumi was planning to flee to her native Japan with her family and his son. Megumi, and Simione's own employees, though, describe how . In an effort to protect himself from what he believed was the certain chaos that would engulf the United States, he stockpiled dozens of assault rifles, a massive .50-caliber rifle made to stop vehicles, and up to 70,000 rounds of ammunition. Simione, seen in court at left, was arrested and ordered held on $5million bail. He was charged with three counts of soliciting first-degree murder, child abuse and threatening to use an explosive . Simione's estrange wife and his employees said he had become increasingly paranoid after he began to abuse steroids . Simione's ex-wife said he told her that he believed Megumi was planning to take the couple's child to her native Japan after the divorce . Police say Simione was also building a pipe bomb and had acquired many of the raw materials to assemble one. Court documents allege he also asked the El Salvadoran employee for advice on assembling the device - like gang members in his own country. He stashed many of the weapons around his house, along with SWAT-style body armor. He had even built an armored 'kill room' off his bedroom where, according to police, he planned to make a stand and fight SWAT officers if they tried to arrest him at his home. The attorney for Simione's company, Bulldog Tactical, told the Miami Herald that all of the weapons and armor that police seized are legal and that it's part of his business to own and regularly use military-style weapons. His company supplies canvas slings, bandoliers and other accessories for holding weapons and ammunition to the military and law enforcement agencies. Simione was a firefighter in his hometown of Hollywood, Florida, for several years, but never served in the military. 'It sounds all dramatic, but that’s ridiculous,' attorney Susan Brown told the newspaper. 'That’s like a jeweler having jewelry in the house or a lawyer having law books.' A judge ordered him held on $5million bail.","Jason Simione is the owner and founder of Bulldog Tactical Equipment, which makes canvas ammunition pouches and slings for the military .

"By . Chris Parsons . UPDATED: . 10:27 EST, 4 November 2011 . The northern New Mexico town of Los Alamos has been revealed as having the highest concentration of millionaires in America. The town, which is home to a government nuclear weapons lab, topped a report after it was found that more than one in ten households is home to a millionaire. Report findings state there are 885 millionaire households among the population of Los Alamos of around 18,000. Millionaire's row: Los Alamos, New Mexico has 885 millionaire households, accounting for nearly 12 per cent of homes in the town . Luxury living: Many of the towns and cities with the highest concentration of millionaires in the U.S. were on the coast . According to research by financial forecasters Kiplinger, the numbers give Los Alamos an 11.7 per cent concentration of millionaire households. Los Alamos saw off competition from Naples, Florida, which was second, and Bridgeport, Connecticut, which was third in the list. Experts believe the reason behind Los Alamos's unlikely success as the home to the highest concentration of U.S. millionaires is the nearby National Laboratory. The facility is the town's biggest employer and is home to many of the nation's top chemists, physicists and engineers. 1. Los Alamos, New MexicoPopulation: 17,950Millionaire households: 885Concentration of millionaires: 11.7% . 2.

San Francisco, CaliforniaPopulation: 4,335,391 Millionaire households: 121,229 Concentration of millionaires: 7.5% . The inevitably high salaries these top scientists pull in contributes to the town's ranking for concentration of millionaires. Kiplinger said of its report: 'If it weren’t for the national laboratory, Los Alamos might be just another stagecoach stop in the desert. 'Top chemists, engineers and physicists have pulled in hefty paychecks here since 1943, when the lab launched the Manhattan Project.' Los Alamos is an unlikely candidate for the title of the U.S. place with highest concentration of millionaires. The small, dusty city of around 8,000 households has just one public golf course and very few luxury shops, with those wanting to experience the high life usually driving 35 miles northwest to nearby Santa Fe. David Thompson, from Phoenix Marketing International, who conducted the research, said: 'We put out our millionaire update as sort of an informational thing. 'People like to see where the millionaires are. 'Los Alamos has been No. 1 for quite some time, at least five years.'It’s because it’s a small area with a large percentage of highly educated and highly trained engineers and scientists.' According to the Journal North, a spokesperson for the National Laboratory said the average salary for its 9,665 employees is $102,552. No employee at LANL makes more than $1 million annually. Seventy-two percent of lab workers have a bachelor’s degree, 19 percent hold a graduate degree and 22 percent have doctoral degrees. Los Alamos County Councilor Michael Wismer told Journal North: 'When you associate millionaires, you think of Cayman Islands or exclusive mansions, and that really doesn’t depict our community. 'Our largest employer is the laboratory, and people make salaries appropriate with their skill levels. 'We have a very high academic requirement at the lab. We have a brain trust that’s unique, and they’re paid well.' Naples, Florida, known as the 'Paradise Coast' ranked second in the list of the highest concentration of millionaires in the U.S. Second placed Naples, in Florida has a far higher number of millionaire households - over 12,000 - but these are spread over a population of 320,000 people. The area surrounding Naples is known as the 'Paradise Coast, and is popular with wealthy holidaymakers and retired couples. The combined area of Bridgeport, Stamford and Norwalk in Fairfield County, Connecticut, has an even larger number of millionaires - nearly 30,000 - across its population of nearly 917,000. According to the Kiplinger report, the southwest Connecticut area is a 'hotbed for the sweater-vest and sailing crowd', while Norwalk boasts 13 private boat clubs.",Nearly 12 per cent of households in Los Alamos have assets worth $1m or more .

NFL legend Jerry Rice has finally sold his custom-built mansion after almost six years for less the half the original asking price. The six-bedroom, ten-bathroom home in Atherton, California, about 30 miles from San Francisco, was originally put on the market in 2007 for $22million. But after failing to find a buyer, the former San Francisco 49er sold the home in January for $9million, reports Realtor.com. The Hall of Famer had the three-storey mansion built in 2001 and comes complete with a vast array of luxuries - including a dedicated gift wrapping room. Set in 1.4 acres of one of the U.S's most expensive zip codes, the house boasts a guesthouse, deluxe home cinema, own elevator and game room with full bar. Befitting for a sportsman known for his gruelling workouts, the mansion also has a full gym, with steam room, sauna and plunge pool. He told Haute Living Magazine in 2001: 'If I’m up late and can’t sleep, I can just trot downstairs for a workout and then relax in the sauna or rejuvenate with the cold plunge. 'I love it for privacy reasons, too. I love being able to get into my workout without having to consider the social aspects of going out to a gym.' There is also a seven-car garage and a 5,000 sq ft basement, which houses a games room, full bar, wine room and craft room.

Jailed: David Kwiatkowski, a former travelling lab technician, reached a plea agreement after being accused of infecting dozens of patients with hepatitis C through contaminated needles . A hospital technician who knowingly infected 47 patients with hepatitis C has reached a plea agreement that will jail him for around 30 years instead of the nearly 100 he could have faced if convicted in a trial. The travelling technician is accused of using hospital painkiller syringes and returning the contaminated devices to the shelf. He told investigators he had been stealing . drugs for more than a decade and was 'killing a lot of people,' according to the plea agreement filed Monday. Without the agreement, David Kwiatkowski . faced prosecution in the states of New Hampshire, Kansas, Georgia and . Maryland. The document, drawn up by prosecutors in a New Hampshire federal court, . revealed that across these states Kwiatkowski had infected patients with the same strain of the virus that he had. The document also contained new revelations that he was fired from two Michigan hospitals and resigned from two others before beginning his traveling temp career. Thirty-two patients in New Hampshire . have been diagnosed with the strain of hepatitis C carried by . Kwiatkowski, who worked at 18 hospitals in seven states before being . hired in New Hampshire in 2011. There have been seven cases in Maryland, . six in Kansas and one in Pennsylvania. One of the Kansas patients has died, . and hepatitis C, a blood-borne viral infection that can cause liver . disease and chronic health issues, played a 'contributing role,' the . plea agreement said. The plea agreement includes details of . an interview Kwiatkowski gave investigators in New Hampshire after his . arrest in which he said he knew he'd been diagnosed in 2010 but . continued to 'swap out' syringes of the painkiller fentanyl. He said he had been stealing drugs . since 2002 and estimated that he had swapped syringes at least 50 times . in New Hampshire, at least 30 times in Georgia and more than 20 times in . Kansas. Under the plea deal, Kwiatkowski would avoid criminal charges . in the latter two states. Kwiatkowski has been jailed since his arrest in Massachusetts in July 2012, when he was  accused of stealing drugs from Exeter Hospital's cardiac catheterization lab, in New Hampshire, and replacing them with blood-tainted saline.

Kwiatkowski has been jailed since his arrest in Massachusetts in July 2012, when he was accused of stealing drugs from the cardiac catheterization lab at Exeter Hospital, New Hampshire, pictured, and replacing them with blood-tainted saline . If convicted at trial, he could have been sentenced to up to 98 years behind bars. He agreed to plead guilty to 14 federal drug theft and tampering charges he faced in exchange for a lighter sentence of 30 to 40 years in prison. Kwiatkowski's attorneys did not immediately respond to emails or a phone message left at their office Monday night. A hearing on the plea agreement is set for Wednesday. Linda Ficken, of Andover, Kansas, is among those Kwiatkowski is accused of infecting. Ficken, 71, said Monday she's glad he pleaded guilty but wishes the sentence were longer. 'It should've been life, since he gave us potentially a death sentence,' she said. More than a year after Kwiatkowski's arrest, Ficken said, she is still angry at Kwiatkowski and at the system that let him move from job to job after he was fired over allegations of drug use and theft. After Kwiatkowski's arrest, two of his previous employers confirmed that he had been fired over drug allegations. But several new incidents emerged in Monday's court filing. According to the plea agreement, Kwiatkowski was fired from a Michigan hospital in 2004 after failing a drug test and was fired from another that year for gross misconduct. He resigned from two more Michigan hospitals while under investigation for drug use.","David Kwiatkowski admitted stealing drugs since 2002 and swapping new syringes with his contaminated ones in hospitals across seven states .

Disguise: Alex Abou-El-Ella, who donned full Islamic dress to undertake a daring mission to snatch her daughter Mona back from the child's father in Egypt . A desperate mother dressed head-to-toe in Islamic dress and hid her face behind a veil to carry out a daring mission to snatch her daughter back from the child's Egyptian father. Alex Abou-El-Ella, 29, of Slough, Berkshire, risked everything to rescue her daughter Mona, three, two years after her husband spirited the girl out of Britain and took her to his home country. She ignored Foreign Office warnings not to travel to the country, which is gripped by civil unrest, tracked down the child and disguised herself as a local to carry out the audacious rescue. Her success was in large part thanks . to the help of British author Donya Al-Nahi, who has been nicknamed Jane . Bond for her efforts in helping a string of women rescue children . snatched by Arab fathers. Mrs . Abou-El-Ella, who is still married to Mona's father, Mustafa, told the . Sunday People of the dramatic moment she snatched back her daughter in . the Nile Delta city of Kafr el-Dawwar. With . the help of Scot-born Mrs Al-Nahi she had tracked down the nursery . where Mona was enrolled and the block of flats where she was living with . her father's family. The . pair, who had enlisted a trusted driver, sat staking out the block early . in the morning until Mona appeared with an aunt and a boy just before . 9am. That's when the desperate mother . seized her moment. Moving awkwardly in the unfamiliar Islamic dress in . which she had disguised her self, she got out of the car and followed . them. 'I was walking behind . them, faster and faster, and saw Mona's hand a few metres away from me,' she said. 'So I grabbed her, pulled her into my arms and the lady . looked at my face - but all she could see were my eyes.' Embracing her child tightly, she turned and fled as the other woman began to scream. Stumbling in the flowing black material of the burka, she had only seconds to bundle the astonished child into the back seat of her car - but was horrified to find the door was locked. 'I was panicking but Donya managed to open it and pull Mona in,' she said. She managed to leap in as well before the woman who she had just snatched Mona from caught up with them and they drove away. It was then that the confused toddler - who had been away for some two years - cried out for help from the woman she knew as mummy, to Mrs Abou-El-Ella's dismay. 'I felt shocked and upset to hear those words coming out of her mouth about another woman,' she said. 'But after half an hour she looked up at me and said, ""Are you my mum?""' Reunited: Alex and Mona back in Slough. It is just 12 days since the pair arrived back in the UK after the rescue . Lots to catch up on: Mona, three, had not seen her mother for two years when she came to rescue her, and didn't recognise her, leading her to call for help from the women she had come to know as her parent . The next challenge was smuggling Mona back out of Egypt without alerting the country's authorities. Mrs Abou-El-Ella, who was born in Poland but came to Britain as a teenager, used the Polish passport belonging to her older daughter to conceal Mona's Egyptian surname and bribed an official to allow her to board a London-bound flight. The subterfuge worked, and they arrived back at Heathrow ten days ago, using Mona's genuine passport to re-enter the UK legally. Mrs Abou-El-Ella has since contacted her husband to tell him that she has their child. Brushing up on her English: After Mona was taken Alex could only speak with her by phone with communication becoming increasingly difficult as the child forgot English and began speaking more and more in Arabic . Together again: Alex with Mona and her eldest daughter Olivia, six, whose passport she used to smuggle the toddler out of Egypt without raising suspicions from border authorities in Cairo . She met Mustafa when he was running a food stall in Slough, shortly after splitting from her former long-term partner and father of her eldest daughter Olivia, six. They moved in together and wed in September 2009, three months before Mona was born, with the former Catholic converting to Islam, although she never practised the religion. Mona was just a year old when Mustafa whisked her off to Egypt, giving his wife no warning of his intentions. He had simply told her he was taking the girl to visit friends. Instead he had travelled straight to Heathrow airport, bought a ticket and boarded an EgytpAir flight. Mrs Abou-El-Ella still has questions about how he was able to get the Mona through passport control without her own passport. Invaluable help: Alex with Donya Al-Nahi, who has been nicknamed Jane Bond for her efforts in helping a string of women rescue children snatched by Arab fathers . Over the following two years, she had on-off contact with her daughter by phone - with communication becoming increasingly difficult as the child forgot English and began speaking more and more in Arabic. And her husband would periodically threaten to cut off contact altogether, she said. Police told her she could do nothing since the UK has no extradition treaty with Egypt. It was only after a woman heard of her plight and contacted her to tip her off about Donya Al-Nahi, who has helped a string of mothers reunite with children snatched by Middle Eastern fathers, that she was given hope. Mrs Al-Nahi said: 'You only have one mother and no-one has the right to take you away from your mum. But Alex was the real hero here. She took the girl.'","Alex Abou-El-Ella risked everything to rescue daughter spirited away by her Egyptian father two years ago .

The need for a political breakthrough is pressing. At least 51 people were killed on . Monday when the army opened fire on Morsi supporters camped outside . Cairo's Republican Guard barracks where the deposed leader is believed . to be held. The military said it opened fire in response to an attack by armed assailants.

VIDEO  Men with rifles spotted firing on pro-Morsi supporters . U.S. officials say they're reviewing developments in Egypt, but the . White House and State Department strongly backed continued U.S. military . and economic assistance to Egypt. 'I'll be blunt - this is an incredibly complex and difficult situation,' White House press secretary Jay Carney answered when asked whether what . occurred in Egypt was a coup. 'There are significant consequences that . go along with this determination, and it is a highly charged issue for . millions of Egyptians who have different views about what happened.' He added, 'It would not be in the best interests of the United States to immediately change our assistance program to Egypt.' Congress, like the administration, is trying to reconcile democratic principles and U.S. interests. Obama and his national security team have condemned the violence, which . killed at least 51 Islamist protesters and three security forces on . Monday alone, but haven't condemned the military for seizing power. Several lawmakers have followed that lead, rejecting any immediate move . to cut off aid at a time when the Muslim Brotherhood is calling for . all-out rebellion against the army and any power vacuum could be filled . by Islamic militant groups that might threaten stability in the Arab . world's most populous country, or in Israel next door. The administration insisted Monday that it won't withhold funds from Egypt's army after its second takeover of a civilian government in the past 29 months. Most of the money goes to the military under an arrangement U.S. leaders have honored since Egypt's 1979 peace treaty with Israel. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., lamented Monday: 'In Egypt, governments come and go. The only thing certain is that American taxpayers will continue to be stuck with the $1.5 billion bill.' The bloodshed has shocked Egyptians, . already tired of the turbulence that began 2-1/2 years ago with the . overthrow of autocrat Hosni Mubarak in a popular uprising. It also raised alarm among key donors . like the United States and the European Union, as well as in Israel, . with which Egypt has had a U.S.-backed peace treaty since 1979. Millions of people took to the streets . on June 30 to demand Morsi's resignation, fearing he was orchestrating a . creeping Islamist takeover of the state - a charge the Brotherhood has . vehemently denied. But for many Islamists, the overthrow . of Egypt's first freely elected president was a bitter reversal that . raised fears of a return to the suppression they endured for decades . under autocratic rulers like Mubarak. Protesters said Monday's shooting . started as they performed morning prayers outside the barracks. But . military spokesman Ahmed Ali said that at 4 a.m. (0200 GMT) armed men . attacked troops in the area in the northeast of the city. Emergency services said 435 people were wounded. At a hospital near Cairo's Rabaa . Adawiya mosque, where many of the wounded and dead were taken, rooms . were crammed full, sheets were stained with blood and medics rushed to . attend to those hurt. 'They shot us with teargas, birdshot, rubber bullets - everything. Then they used live bullets,' said Abdelaziz Abdel Shakua, a bearded 30-year-old who was wounded in his right leg. Mustafa Shalaby, a young doctor at the . hospital - one of at least three places where casualties were taken - . said he counted 45 dead and more than 400 wounded. A Reuters journalist at the scene saw first aid helpers attempting mouth-to-mouth resuscitation on a dying man. Film broadcast by Egyptian state TV . showed Morsi supporters throwing rocks at soldiers in riot gear on one . of the main roads leading to Cairo airport. Young men, some carrying sticks, crouched behind a building, emerging to throw petrol bombs before retreating again. The graphic scenes came just three . days after Cairo, Alexandria and other cities and towns were rocked by . running street battles between Morsi's supporters and opponents, which . went on for hours despite a heavy military presence. Mansour decreed that Egypt will hold . new parliamentary elections once amendments to its suspended . constitution are approved in a referendum - a process that could take . about six months, less than some people had expected. However, it was faulted for repeating flaws in the 2011 transition plan that contributed to the current crisis. In what appeared to be an olive branch . to Islamists, the decree included controversial language put into the . constitution last year that defined the principles of Islamic sharia . law.

Fighting for their cause: Wounded supporters of president Morsi wait for treatment at a field hospital in Cairo . Collateral damage: An ambulance driver lies on a hospital bed after being shot while trying to help the injured . Whether that will be enough to lure . back the hardline Islamist Nour Party, which had supported the . military-led transition plans until Monday's attack, remains to be seen. Nathan Brown, a leading expert on .

A judge has called the Crown Prosecution Service 'crackers' for pursuing a £7.49 criminal damage claim against a retired Army captain. Timothy Hallam, 55, who is said to have sawn the top off a wooden fence post in a long-running dispute with neighbours Alan and Carol Smith in Thurgoland, near Barnsley, is due face trial next month. But district judge John Foster said the decision to prosecute Mr Hallam was 'the height of nonsense' and questioned whether the CPS was in touch with what mattered to the public in a time of austerity. District Judge John Foster, left, has described as 'the height of nonsense' a court case over a £7.49 fence post row between Alan and Carol Smith, pictured right, and their neighbour, retired Army captain Timothy Hallam . Sitting at Barnsley Magistrates Court, the judge said: 'I cannot believe - even given the vagaries of the Crown Prosecution Service these days - that it wants to proceed with this case against a 55-year-old man of exemplary character. 'It is crackers. The CPS really needs to get some sense of what is important to the public. 'This is a dispute between neighbours. It was a fence post before he cut the top off it and it is still a fence post. 'The neighbour is £7.49 out of pocket. It is the height of nonsense.' The Smiths are believed to have filmed Mr Hallam chopping the top off the fence post with their CCTV cameras. Mr Hallam said the case arose from a long-running dispute with his . neighbour over rights of access and encroachment. He said: 'This is a matter of . principle which I will not give way to. If I lose the case it could . undermine a seriously expensive civil action. 'Take my employment away as well as . leave me with a criminal record but the principle is something I will . live with long after all this is over and I want to be able to live . comfortably with my conscience if I have nothing else in the world.' Prosecutor Chantel Lowery-Green said . it was impossible to prove whose land the fence post was on, and said it . was felt Mr Hallam had to be prosecuted because of a chance of further . trouble. A CCTV still showing Timothy Hallam chopping the top off the fence post - he argues it is on his property . The fence post, seen here in the centre of the picture with wires coming out of it, is at the centre of the case . She said the boundary dispute was due to be sorted out at county court. 'A way out of this would have been to offer Captain Hallam the chance to be bound over to keep the peace. 'I understand he will not accept a . binding over because he says he was in his rights to cut the top off the . post. We will have to list it for trial.' Brian . Bushell, for Mr Hallam, said he believed he was within his legal rights . to cut off the top of the post because it was on his land and he . claimed it contravened planning regulations. Neighbours' dispute: The post lies between the Smiths' home, left, and Mr Hallam's house, on the right . The Smiths are said to have been involved in a long-running dispute with their neighbour in the Yorkshire village . Now Barnsley Central MP Dan Jarvis has waded into the row, saying the CPS needed to clarify the issue to assure the public that the correct decision had been made to prosecute. He said: 'Given the current pressures on the public purse and the comments made by the judge, it is right that questions are asked about the wisdom of pursuing a case of this nature which has presumably come at significant expense to the taxpayer.' Mr Hallam was granted unconditional bail until the trial on September 12. A CPS spokesman said following the judge’s comments they would reassess the case before proceeding with the prosecution. He said: 'We are aware of concerns raised by district judge Foster. This is a matter which was charged by the police and we await a full file from them at which point the matter will be further reviewed.'","Timothy Hallam, 55, of Thurgoland, S Yorks, is accused of criminal damage .

"Birds set up home on roof and made nest in chimney after she fed them . By . Amanda Williams . PUBLISHED: . 08:42 EST, 8 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 04:04 EST, 9 August 2013 . Terror: Retired care worker Penny Freeman, 69, said she could not leave her house without fear of attack from seagulls . A pensioner has claimed she was held hostage in her own home for four days - by seagulls. Retired care worker Penny Freeman, 69, said she could not leave her house without fear of attack from the birds, which she said swooped and vomited on her. The gulls set up camp in her back garden to protect a nest in the chimney - and 'flapped and pecked' at Ms Freeman every time she went outside. Ms Freeman said she and 67-year-old brother Jim were stuck inside her home in Bridlington, East Yorkshire, for four days. She said: 'It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying. I felt like a prisoner. 'I couldn’t get to my washing, I couldn’t even leave the house from the back door because the gulls wood swoop at me, squawk, flap their wings and try to scare me away. 'It was pandemonium - really frightening. The noise was appalling. The father bird would sit on the shed which is about three feet away from the house and flap its wings. 'They also warn off predators with vomit, so when we tried to go outside, they would vomit on us. It was really vile.' Ms Freeman told how gulls first became attracted to her property around eight months ago when she started feeding some birds in her garden. From then on, one of the gulls became increasingly aggressive, pecking at her windows with such force that she thought the glass would break. The birds set up home on her roof and made a nest in her chimney. Then at the end of last month, a fledgling fell from the roof into their garden- and since then the birds have not left its side. She and her brother Jim, who ran a convenience store before he retired, said they have been waiting with baited breath for the little chick to learn to fly so its parents would leave. 'Every time it flapped its wings we thought, ""this is it, we’re free"",' Ms Freeman said. 'But eventually after about four days it did fly off and its parents followed too. One of the birds which Ms Freeman, 69, claims held her 'hostage'. She took this piicture through the window of her Bridlington, East Yorkshire . The retired residential home worker couldn't walk out of her house without the two birds - which had set up camp in her back garden to protect their chick - attacking her by flying at her . 'They are like lizards, they are raptors and they have nasty scaly feet. I find them very threatening.' Ms Freeman, who retired to the seafront less than a year ago, is now calling for action from the East Riding of Yorkshire Council. She said: 'I would like to see some sort of Government help and advice for helping to keep them off your roof. 'I would like the council to start taking this seriously because the centre of town is a mess - it is a real mess. 'I do really think that something should be done to make sure this doesn’t happen to other people. I like to see birds from a distance we have a wonderful bird variety in the garden.' A spokesperson for East Riding of Yorkshire Council said culling is not a 'practical or economical method of control'. For four days Ms Freeman, who lives with her 67-year-old brother Jim Fudge, was holed up inside her home in the picturesque seaside town . He said: 'Being harassed by the adult birds protecting their young can be difficult to deal with until the fledglings have left the area. 'The main way to resolve the problem is to proof buildings to prevent the birds nesting in the first place. 'Gulls can present a variety of problems, including noise, mess caused by droppings, damage to property, birds swooping on animals and people, and flues becoming blocked by nesting materials. 'The solution for individual property owners is to undertake bird-proofing measures to deter the gulls from roosting or nesting on their building. Terror from above: Ms Freeman said: 'It was terrifying, absolutely terrifying. I felt like a prisoner' Ms Freeman told how the torment began about eight months ago when she started feeding the birds in her garden - and now it's worse than ever . 'A range of proofing methods exist, including netting and bird spikes to deter birds from roosting. The responsibility for proofing a building rests with the property owner, and not the local authority. 'Problems arising from the aggressive behaviour of birds stealing food from people’s hands are exacerbated by the feeding of birds by residents and visitors.' Kay Harrison, of the RSPCA Bridlington, Driffield and District Branch, said: 'Regarding gulls, people should not feed them. They do get very protective over their young and young birds should be left alone. 'Their parents will be watching them. Injured birds can be taken to any vet who will deal with them with no charge to the finder.'","Penny Freeman, 69, said she couldn't leave her house without fear of attack .

A Michigan oncologist has been set a $9 million bond by a federal judge after being accused of intentionally misdiagnosing cancer patients in Detroit to scam Medicare. Judge Sean Cox made the ruling Tuesday, following a hearing in which prosecutors asked him to increase Dr. Farid Fata's $170,000 bond to $9 million, based on the assets available to him and his wife. They fear 48-year-old Dr Fata, who was born in Lebanon, may try to flee the country. Scam: Dr. Farid Fata is accused of administering cancer treatment to people who didn't need it to scam Medicare out of millions of dollars . Cox also ordered that Fata not practice medicine if he's released on bond. Defense lawyer Christopher Andreoff wanted a much lower cash bond amount for Fata. He says his client is a U.S. citizen and not a flight risk. The . government says Dr Fata, who owns Michigan Hematology Oncology, ripped . off Medicare by giving chemotherapy to patients who didn't need it and . diagnosing cancer when it wasn't apparent. Prosecutors are still looking for victims in the case, according to CBS Detroit affiliate WWJ. Patients . of Dr Fata who have questions concerning their medical records or . information regarding the investigation are urged to call the U.S. Attorney's Office Information Line at 888-702-0553. The oncologist is accused of bilking the federal government out of millions of dollars in Medicare from the unnecessary chemotherapy to patients in remission. Raid: Federal agents seized medical records from several of Fata's Detroit-area offices (pictured) According . to federal prosecutors, Dr. Fata, of Oakland Township, 'systematically . defrauded Medicare by submitting false claims for services that were . medically unnecessary.' According . to the complaint, Fata defrauded the federally funded healthcare . program out of roughly $35million over a two-year period. On . Tuesday, federal authorities took Fata into custody and raided several . of his offices in the Detroit area, seizing medical records they say . will show that he was misdiagnosing patients in a scam to steal from the . federal government. 'Violating a patient's trust and placing them at risk through fraudulent . abuse of our nation's health care system is deplorable,' FBI Special . Agent in Charge Robert D. Foley III said in a news release. At . a bond hearing on Friday, Jeff Berz, whose father was one of Fata's . patients, testified that Fata refused to stop administering drugs after . his father didn't respond to chemotherapy. History: Oncology nurse Angela Swantek says she complained to investigators about Fata in 2010 . 'From the time that my father began getting the chemotherapy, his health deteriorated,' he said. Angela . Swantek, an oncology nurse who spent time at one of Fata's clinics, . told ABC News that she first complained to investigators about Fata's . alleged wrongdoings as far back as 2010. 'I . don't know how he's gotten away with it for this long,' she told ABC . News. 'I was disgusted. I got in the car, I was still sitting in the . parking lot and I was truly almost in tears just because of what I saw . and how patients were getting their chemotherapy.' Fata's attorney, Christopher Andreoff, says the government is wrong and that his client is not guilty of anything. 'The . government has not retained an expert to give an opinion that there was . a mistreatment, or misdiagnosis, or unnecessary tests given to any . patient,' he said. If convicted, Fata faces up to 20 years in jail.","Dr. Farid Fata 'systematically defrauded Medicare by submitting false claims for services that were medically unnecessary,' authorities say .

Children's sweets were last night at the centre of new fears over the horsemeat scandal. It emerged that gelatine, which originates from the skin and bones of animals and is found in sweets as well as jelly, trifles and some yoghurts, will be tested for traces of horse. The tests will be expanded to 514 products in total, including stock cubes and steak, the Food Standards Agency said yesterday. Children's sweets are among a new set of products set to be tested for traces of horse (file picture) Products such as stock cubes contain gelatine which is made from the skin and bone of animals . Last night the FSA could not confirm whether children’s sweets would be among the products tested, as it had not yet decided on the exact list. The news came as the House of Commons catering outlets were dragged into the scandal. Parliamentary authorities admitted four beef products had been withdrawn from the heavily subsidised eateries used by MPs, peers and staff. Nestle has confirmed that three of its products have been recalled from France, Italy and Spain . A Commons spokesman said the withdrawn products were steak and kidney pie, beef and onion pie, steak and kidney suet pudding, and beef meat balls. He added the move was 'precautionary' after one of the House’s suppliers, Brakes, announced it was carrying out tests. He added: 'This relates to meat derivative products rather than to fresh meat provided at the House of Commons.' A spokesman for Brakes last night said that all four of the products the Commons asked it to test were negative for horse DNA. Two phases of FSA testing are currently ongoing. The first phase includes raw minced beef products such as burgers, minced beef and meat balls, which are being checked for horse and pork DNA. The second includes 140 samples of beef-based ready meals including lasagne and cottage pie. The third phase, which will begin next week, includes products marketed or labelled as containing beef as a major ingredient, such as gelatine, stock cubes and beef dripping. These 150 samples will bring the total number of products tested to 514. The FSA will publish the results from all three phases of the study, including brand names, with initial findings available from the end of the month. Twenty-eight local authorities are carrying out the sampling for the first two phases. Sampling for the third will be allocated to other councils. The agency will disclose any formal action taken in April. Meanwhile Nestle confirmed that three of its products had been recalled in France, Italy and Spain. They were not on sale in the UK. In a statement, the company said: 'Our tests have found traces of horse DNA in two products made from beef supplied by HJ Schypke [a German firm]. 'The levels found are above the 1 per cent threshold the UK’s Food Safety Agency uses to indicate likely adulteration or gross negligence.

Coming to the same conclusion as it did in December, the all-male panel found that bosses can fire employees they see as threats to their marriages, even if the subordinates have not engaged in flirtatious or other inappropriate behavior. The court said such firings do not count as illegal sex discrimination because they are motivated by feelings, not gender. Game over: Iowa's top court upheld its ruling that dentist James Knight (right) had a right to fire hygienist Melissa Nelson (left) out of fear she'd make him want to stray from his marriage . Happily married: This undated photo provided by Melissa Nelson shows Melissa with her husband, Steve, and their children in Fort Dodge, Iowa . The 32-page ruling upholds a judge's . decision to dismiss a discrimination lawsuit filed against Fort Dodge . dentist James Knight, who fired assistant Melissa Nelson, even while . acknowledging she had been a stellar employee for 10 years. Knight . and his wife believed that his attraction to Nelson — two decades . younger than the dentist — had become a threat to their marriage. Nelson, now 33, was replaced by another woman; Knight had an all-female . staff. The all-male court . issued its revised opinion Friday in the case after taking the unusual . step last month of withdrawing its December opinion, which had received . nationwide publicity, debate and criticism. Fashion choices: Melissa Nelson insisted that she did not wear inappropriate, too-tight ensembles to work, instead wearing her uniform (pictured) Nelson's . attorney, Paige Fiedler, had asked the court in January to reconsider, . calling the decision a blow for gender and racial equity in the . workplace. She had warned . the opinion could allow bosses to legally fire dark-skinned blacks and . replace them with light-skinned blacks or small-breasted workers in . favor of big-breasted workers. 'It . was a great decision,' Knight's attorney, Stu Cochrane, told Messenger News. 'I don't . see this as necessarily different from their first decision, but I'm . impressed with the court's effort to clearly communicate the rationale . for the decision.' Justice . Edward Mansfield wrtoe in their opinion that had  Nelson brought a . sexual harassment or hostile work environment claim, the outcome could . have been different. Instead, the former employee had alleged that she . was fired because of her gender. The court had only granted reconsiderations five times in the last decade. Dr Knight had said he fired Ms. Nelson because he'd grown too close to her and was worried he'd try to start an affair. In December, the court ruled 7-0 bosses can sack . employees they see as an 'irresistible attraction,' even if they have . not engaged in flirtatious behavior or otherwise done anything wrong. The decision drew national attention and sparked much controversy. Ms. Nelson's attorney said Iowa's all-male high court, one of only a handful in the nation, failed to recognize the discrimination women see routinely in the workplace. The dental nurse insisted she was never interested in Knight romantically, regardless of his own feelings. 'Absolutely not,' she said. 'I'm happily married.' Content: Happily married with children Nelson said she saw Knight as a father figure and had 'absolutely' no interest in him romantically . Since Knight fired her she has been working as a waitress six nights a week. While her former boss claimed her clothes were so tight he couldn't look at her without being aroused, Ms. Nelson said the only outfit she wore to work was standard scrubs worn by many nurses and assistants in dental offices. Asked if she saw herself as irresistibly attractive, she laughed. 'I'm just an ordinary girl,' she said. 'Just an ordinary mom.' Ms. Nelson, 33, worked for Knight for 10 years, and he considered her a stellar worker. But in the final months of her employment, he complained that her tight clothing was distracting, once telling her that if his pants were bulging that was a sign her clothes were too revealing, according to the opinion. He also once allegedly remarked about her infrequent sex life by saying, 'that's like having a Lamborghini in the garage and never driving it.' Knight and Nelson — both married with children — started exchanging text messages, mostly about personal matters, such as their families. Knight's wife, who also worked in the dental office, discovered the messages and demanded Nelson be fired. The Knights consulted their pastor, who agreed that terminating Nelson was appropriate. Knight fired Nelson and gave her one month's severance. He later told Nelson's husband he worried he was getting too personally attached and feared he would eventually try to start an affair with her. Family man: Knight's wife, who also works in the dental office, demanded Nelson be fired when she discovered text messages . Ordinary mom: Nelson has been working as a waitress since she lost her dental job and is unsure of her future career path . Nelson was stunned because she viewed . the 53-year-old Knight as a father figure and had never been interested . in starting a relationship, Fiedler said. Nelson filed a lawsuit alleging gender discrimination, arguing Knight wouldn't have terminated her if she was male. She did not allege sexual harassment because Knight's conduct may not have risen to that level and didn't particularly offend her, Fiedler said. However, it has been revealed Knight sent Nelson raunchy text messages about six months before her dismissal asking how often she 'experiences orgasms.' Knight argued Ms. Nelson was fired not because of her gender, but because her continued employment threatened his marriage. A district judge agreed, dismissing the case before trial, and the high court upheld that ruling. Mansfield noted that Knight had an all-female workforce and Ms. Nelson was replaced by a woman. He said the decision was in line with state and federal court rulings that found workers can be fired for relationships that cause jealousy and tension within a business owner's family. One such case from the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld a business owner's firing of a valued employee who was seen by his wife as a threat to their marriage. In that case, the fired employee had engaged in flirtatious conduct. Jurisprudence: Justice Edward Mansfield penned the Iowa Supreme Court's decision on Knight's dismissal of Melissa Nelson . Mansfield said allowing Nelson's lawsuit would stretch the definition of discrimination to allow anyone fired over a relationship to file a claim arguing they would not have been fired but for their gender. Knight's attorney said the court got it right. The decision clarified that bosses can make decisions showing favoritism to a family member without committing discrimination; in this case, by allowing Knight to honor his wife's wishes to fire Nelson, he said. Knight is a very religious and moral individual, and he sincerely believed that firing Nelson would be best for all parties, he said. 'While there was really no fault on the part of Mrs. Nelson, it was just as clear the decision to terminate her was not related to the fact that she was a woman,' he said. 'The motives behind Dr. Knight terminating Mrs. Nelson were quite clear: He did so to preserve his marriage. 'I don't view this as a decision that was either pro-women or opposed to women rights at all. In my view, this was a decision that followed the appropriate case law.'","Melissa Nelson was fired in 2010 after working for dentist for 10 years .

But it could also cause potentially deadly changes in blood pressure. Research shows many people’s blood pressure varies with temperature, with a drop in the mercury particularly damaging. Over time, these fluctuations raise the odds of dying by more than a third. Lack of sunshine and inches of rain can also take their toll, the Glasgow University study found. Rain, rain go away: Scottish researchers found that British weather could be putting people's health at risk because sudden drops in air temperature affect blood pressure . While the finding may seem odd, blood vessels near the surface are known to narrow in cold weather, to conserve heat, which increases blood pressure. Blood pressure changes put the body under strain and increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. Researchers said doctors should note the weather when measuring a patient’s blood pressure. This would help them determine which patients are sensitive to it so they can adjust their treatment accordingly. Heart expert Sandosh Padmanabhan made the link after comparing more than 40 years of blood pressure data on patients in the west of Scotland with meteorological data for the area. It showed half of the patients were sensitive to drops in temperature, such as those that occur between summer and winter. A fall of around 10C led to an increase in blood pressure of between 3mm and 6mm of mercury. While this might not seem much, a change of just 2mm is enough to significantly affect the odds of fatal heart attacks and strokes. Dr Padmanabhan said: ‘Every millimetre counts, that’s the important thing.’ Further analysis showed those whose blood pressure was sensitive to temperature were 35 per cent more likely to die over the period studied. Lack of sunshine also increased blood pressure – likely due to dull days tending to be colder. Rain was found to be damaging but the researchers attributed this to patients becoming stressed while struggling to the doctor’s in wet weather. Heart attacks and strokes are more common in winter, but the study, published in the journal Hypertension, is the first to look at the issue in detail. Dr Padmanabhan said doctors need to be aware of the link to properly manage blood pressure. Otherwise a good reading in summer may lead to a patient missing out on potentially vital medicine. Similarly, someone who is known to be sensitive to temperature could pay extra attention to what they eat and how much exercise they do, to keep their heart healthy. A Blood Pressure UK spokesman said: ‘It is really interesting to know there may be a relationship between the weather and blood pressure; more research is needed to understand the potential mechanisms behind this. ‘However until we can control the weather, we can still rely on more traditional ways of controlling our blood pressure, such as eating more fruit and vegetables, less salt and alcohol, and taking more exercise. ‘Even if the sun isn’t shining, I  would advise going for a brisk walk as a reliable way of reducing your long-term blood pressure.’ High blood pressure affects almost 16million people in the UK. Scientists have recommended doctors note the weather when taking the blood pressure of patients because it may give a truer reflection of a person's health .","Scottish research found air temperature changes affect blood pressure .

New York state police now have the power to see whether New Yorkers are texting while driving - even if their phones are on their laps. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo has launched a $1 million plan to prevent distracted driving,  including purchasing specially-modified Chevy Tahoes that sit higher than regular SUVs for the police department. These modified cars enable police to look down through other vehicle's windows to discern whether a driver is using their phone while driving. Text book arrest: Trooper Donald Ginnane using a modified Chevy Tahoe vehicle issues a ticket to yet another distracted driver talking on a cell phone . Modified: The unmarked Chevy Tahoes sit higher than regular SUVs enabling police to see into other vehicles to discern whether people are using their mobile phones while driving . The cars are part of Governor Cuomo's war on distracted driving. In addition to the new cars, the state has enacted stricter punishments for those caught using their phone on the road. Last week, Cuomo signed a law that raises the penalty for texting-and-driving to match those for reckless driving and speeding. Distracted: Driving while using a mobile phone is now punishable by steep fines and demerit points . Anyone caught texting or browsing on their smart phones while driving will incur a first-time fine of between $50 and $150 and lose five points from their license. Drive and ambition: Governor Cuomo has been pushing his anti-distracted-driving agenda since his first year in office in 2011 . Second-time offenders who are caught using a phone on the road will be fined up to $200, and thereafter could pay up to $400. 'Distracted driving has become a frightening epidemic on our roadways, and fines are an important tool to punish and prevent this reckless behavior,' Cuomo said in a news release. 'Combined with stronger penalties on your license and increased . enforcement, these increased fines will send a tough message to all . drivers that distracted driving is a serious problem with serious . consequences.' Cuomo's crackdown on distracted driving isn't just a professional quest - it's personal. The Governor has three children at home, two of whom are teenagers new to the roads. 'This is very real. I’m living this. I have two 18-year-olds who are driving,' Cuomo told ABC News. New York state figures show that one in five accidents are caused by distracted driving.

Nearly half of the 12 million children in England have rotting teeth or are at serious risk of tooth decay, according to a damning official report. Sugary drinks, snacks between meals and poor dental checks are all blamed for the rapid deterioration of children’s teeth before they are eight. By the time they are 17, six in ten suffer from tooth decay or gum disease, or are  at risk of the problems, according to a Department of Health survey. The worrying results come after the introduction of a ‘traffic lights’ scheme which is being trialled in 95 dentists’ surgeries in England and which the Government is hoping will lead to a revolution  in dental care. Under the new system, patients will be given a more thorough check-up than currently provided on the NHS, and then given a ‘green’, ‘amber’ or ‘red’ rating on the condition of their teeth and gums. Initial results from the trial, seen by The Mail on Sunday, show that 28 per cent of England’s 44 million adults and 13 per cent of children under 18 have a red rating, meaning they are actively suffering from tooth decay or gum disease. A third of children and more than half of adults are classed as amber, meaning that they are at serious risk of dental problems. Only 16 per cent of adults and 55 per cent of children were given a green rating for healthy teeth and gums. Every year about 30,000 children end up being admitted to hospital because of rotten teeth. Many have five or six taken out at once, with some having the whole set of 20 baby teeth removed. Dr Stephen Fayle, a Leeds-based paediatric dentistry consultant, described the figures as ‘worrying’ and said that too many parents let their children snack throughout the day. He added: ‘We know children who eat and drink between meals are much more likely to get dental decay.’ Consumption of ‘healthy’ pure fruit juices and products marketed as ‘no sugar added’ had also exploded, he said. ‘Parents think they are giving their children healthy drinks between meals, but they can do a  lot of damage.’ Explosion: There has been a sharp rise in the number of 'no added sugar' products available on the market, but these can be high in naturally occurring sugar . Such drinks were doubly dangerous as they were high in naturally occurring sugar as well as being acidic, which weakened the enamel. ‘The average level of decay in five-year-olds now is very similar to the level  in 1983,’ he said. But in poorer areas the situation was worse, with deprived children losing more teeth by five than in the early 1980s. The pilots, which could be rolled out across the country by 2015, are designed  to replace the much criticised contract, devised by Labour in 2006. This contract is extremely unpopular with some dentists, who say it promotes a quick-fix ‘drill and fill’ approach because it offers rewards for carrying out treatment rather than keeping patients’ teeth healthy. Last year, the Office of Fair Trading found that unscrupulous dentists were duping patients into paying millions of pounds for private treatment that should be free on the NHS. However, Barry Cockcroft, chief dental officer for England, last night claimed the traffic-light findings were ‘not statistically robust’ and stressed: ‘There is no country in the world that has lower rates of children’s tooth decay.’ Dr Cockcroft helped preside over the 2006 contract, in which dentists are paid for how many ‘units of dental activity’ they carry out. He admitted: ‘It seems perverse to continue to pay dentists to do more and more treatment, when the volume of disease is falling. We want to pay them according to better outcomes for patients.’ Dr John Milne, chairman of the General Dental Practice Committee of the British Dental Association, welcomed the move towards preventative dentistry as ‘a positive step forward’, but said  more still needed to be done to improve children’s teeth.","'Traffic light scheme' being trialled in England to combat tooth decay .

Barring an unfortunate lightning strike, it looks like Alex Rodriguez was right - he will be in the Yankees’ lineup Monday night. Despite multiple reports claiming to confirm Major League Baseball will announce on Monday a 214 game suspension – along with 50 game bans for as many as 15 others – of the tarnished player, Rodriguez will be able to play Monday night. The accused cheater’s plan to appeal the suspension allows for him to be on the field until an arbitrator hears the case. Despite openly defying the league and practically daring MLB Commissioner Bud Selig to ban him for life, Rodriguez is able to appeal because of how the suspension is being handed down. Scroll down for video . What, me worry?: Alex Rodriguez is expected to appeal his suspension allowing him to play until the case is heard by an arbitrator . Expected to be announced at 12pm Monday, Rodriguez’s suspension can be appealed because it will be handled exactly as the other suspensions set to be announced – as part of the joint drug agreement, according to reports. By suspending the slugger, who boasted on Friday that he’d play for the Yankees Monday unless he was ‘struck by lightning,’ in that manner, Selig enables Rodriguez to appeal to an arbitrator under the guidelines of drug testing regime agreed to between the league and the player’s union. A lifetime ban is no longer being considered, according to CBS Sports’ Jon Heyman. Per the JGA, Rodriguez can don the pinstripes until a decision is reached by an arbitrator, allowing him to play Monday night and into the immediate future, at the very least. The Yankees have no choice but to activate the aging slugger if he is ready to play. The teams of all players involved have been notified of their suspensions, according to the New York Daily News. Almost all of the players are expected to accept the suspensions without appeal, the league also notified Yankees that Rodriguez will appeal the suspension, the paper noted. Should an arbitrator side with the league and uphold the suspension in full, it would likely carry into the 2015 season, a risk Rodriguez appears willing to take. Defiant till the bitter end: Rodriguez boasted Friday night that he was going to play for the Yankees Monday unless 'struck by lightning' Something on his mind?: Rodriguez looks like he has the weight of the world on his shoulders in this photo from the 2009 season . Originally reported to be 12 players, including a few minor leaguers, the total suspended is now expected to be 15, Heyman originally reported Sunday afternoon. It is not known who the three additional players are – but they will not be Oakland A’s pitcher Bartolo Colon, Toronto Blue Jays outfielder Melky Cabrera or San Diego Padres catcher Yasmani Grandal since they were suspended last year for use of performance enhancing drugs. In taking his case to an arbitrator, Rodriguez, 38, will likely try to throw the Yankees – a team that will have paid him over $275million by the end of this season – under a bus for a host of reasons. Rodriguez plans to accuse team doctors of misdiagnosing injuries and the Yankees of mishandling injuries of his as far back as 2009 – which forced him to seek alternatives that would put him back on the field, according to the Daily News. An A-bomb! From A-Rod: Rodriguez watches his towering home run sail over the fence Friday night . Chicks dig the long ball: At least one fan was happy to see Rodriguez during his final rehab game Saturday for the Trenton Thunder . The long-fading star may also point to the fact that the longest suspension served for a PED-related offense since the drug testing program went into effect in 2005 was 100 games after Giants’ pitcher Guillermo Mota’s second positive test. A-Rod has never tested positive for PEDs. Despite the level of vitriol directed at the team, manager Joe Girardi told reporters in San Diego Sunday that he has the accused steroid cheat ‘penciled in’ for Monday. ‘He's in there, and I'm going to play him,"" Yankees manager Joe Girardi said after New York's 6-3 loss at San Diego.’ The three-time MVP brazenly declared Saturday that he’d be flying to Chicago to join the team for Monday’s game, but there are still doubts Rodriguez can play third base on an everyday basis after 20 years in the Major Leagues, especially coming off his second hip surgery. Better times: Rodriguez celebrates as the Yankees clinch the 2009 World Series, his only championship . The honeymoon ended quickly: What started out so promising, quickly became acrimonious as A-Rod's personal life soon became a major distraction for the team . Rodriguez only played a full nine innings once during his most recent rehab stint at Double-A Trenton, and had very few chances in the field. He did hit a two-run home run Friday night, in addition to cleanly fielding the only two chances he had at third, but he only played five innings. The 14-time all-star walked in all four of his plate appearances during his final minor league game Saturday night. Shortly after hitting the home run, Rodriguez went rogue during a post-game news conference. The alleged cheat accused both the Yankees and MLB of conspiring to keep him off the field and void his contract. ‘There is more than one party that benefits from me not ever stepping back on the field. And that's not my teammates and it's not the Yankee fans,’ the tormented slugger said, adding, ‘when all this stuff is going on in the background and people are finding creative ways to cancel your contract and stuff like that, I think that's concerning for me.’ Not everyone is convinced: A fan holds a sign that reads ""CHEATER,"" while Rodriguez signs autographs before a Friday rehab game for Double-A Trenton . Been there, done that: Fans have been holding up signs labeling the beleaguered player a cheater for years, this sign is being held up by a fan in Philadelphia during the 2009 World Series . Though teammates have supported the paranoid pariah’s return to the team while on the record, many reports have them saying off the record that he will be an unnecessary distraction, something Girardi publicly disagreed with. ‘I don't suspect it'll be awkward. Most of these guys know him as a teammate and have laughed a lot with Alex and been around Alex a lot,’ he said. ‘I think it'll be business as usual. I'm sure there will be more media there, obviously, tomorrow, but I think that's probably more for Alex to deal with than the rest of the guys. I don't think it'll be a big deal.’ Big deal or not, A-Rod was right, all signs point to him being in the road greys Monday night against the White Sox, unless he is struck by lightning. Wonder what he was thinking: Rodriguez stares at the ball he hit for his 600th home run in August, 2010 .","A 214 game suspension against Alex Rodriguez is expected to be announced - along with other, lesser bans - Monday afternoon .

Twitter could become the latest high profile company to come under scrutiny for its tax arrangements after reporting UK profits of less than £100,000. The abbreviated accounts of the company, which is tipped to float on the New York stock market for £7billion, indicate that the company may be using corporate structures in Ireland to close deals with UK advertisers. Such a set up, similar to a controversial arrangement adopted by internet giant Google, would mean that any profits from the sales would not be subject to tax.

Low profits: The company has reported profits of less than £100,000 in the UK last year . Google faced much criticism for claiming to 'close' its deals in Ireland. Although there was no suggestion that Google had broken any laws, chairman of the Commons public accounts committee Margaret Hodge, concluded that its behaviour on tax was 'devious, calculated and, in my view, unethical'. She had received evidence from several tax whistleblowers. Profits remaining in the company after tax are listed in Twitter's abbreviated accounts at £92,408 for 2012 compared with £16,500 from the previous year. Twitter's London headquarters would not confirm whether UK sales were completed in Ireland, according to The Guardian. Similar arrangement?

Cops are hunting for the driver of a red Ferrari that slammed into a car carrying two retirees, killing one of them and leaving his long-time partner heartbroken. The owner of the 2009 Ferrari Scuderia, Radomin Delgado, is considered ‘a person of interest’ and is being sought after by the Florida Highway Patrol, but has not been named a suspect in the death of retired postal worker Jorge Arrojas, 60 – the driver of the car smashed into by the super car at over 100mph. It is not known if Delgado was driving the car, but the well-known amateur race car driver has been ticketed driving at excessive speeds in the past, according to reports. Heartbroken: Miguel Larrieu (left) lost life-long partner Jorge Arrojas (right) in a violent collision with a fast-moving Ferrari . Arrojas and partner Miguel Larrieu, partners for over four decades and best friends since childhood, were in a 2012 Hyundai Sonata and had just merged onto a highway when they were rear-ended by the Ferrari, which officers told NBC Miami was traveling at a high rate of speed. ‘It was like an explosion,’ Larrieu told the Sun-Sentinal. The Hyundai was sent tumbling through the air and over the guardrail, end over end until coming to a rest with Arrojas slumped over, his head on Larrieu’s chest. Larrieu frantically tried to wake his dead best friend, ‘in 10 seconds, my life as it was came to an end,’ he told the Sun-Sentinal. ‘Please Jorge breathe,' I must have said it 100 times,’ Larrieu told NBC Miami between tears. In a heap: The 2009 Ferrari Scuderia that hit Arrojas and Larrieu's Hyundai Sonata is unrecognizable . A person of interest: Radomin Delgado, the owner of the Ferrari, is being sought by authorities for questioning . The driver of the car fled the scene and was not found by baffled FHP officers. ‘We don't know how he left the scene. Whether he may have been picked up by someone else, or called someone. Witnesses say when they went down to the Ferrari, they could not find the driver,’ FHP spokesman Joe Sanchez told NBC Miami. Authorities know the car belongs to Delgado, but have not spoken to him since the horrific collision. Visits to his gated home by both the FHP and local media have been met with silence. A lawyer hired by Delgado sent an email to the FHP saying that his client is invoking his right to be silent, according to officials. Shattered: Larrieu is devastated over Arrojas' death . ‘The lawyer told us he had advised his clients not to speak about the case without him being present,’ FHP spokesperson Joe Sanchez told the Miami Herald. ‘He said his clients have invoked their right to remain silent’ Authorities want to meet with Delgado because they would easily be able to determine if he was in the car or not based on injuries or bruising he would have. ‘It's important that we see the owner of . the vehicle because if he was driving the Ferrari, he's going to have . some injuries and based on that injury, due to the airbag explosion or . the impact itself, then we can go ahead and seek a warrant,’ Sanchez . told NBC Miami. Gone, but not forgotten: Arrojas lifelong partner said 'his absence will be missed forever' Delgado was ticketed last year for driving over 100mph on a local highway, according to NBC Miami, he has not yet been charged in this collision. Finding Arrojas' killer may be of some consolation to Larrieu, but it will not replace his life-long partner. ‘All I feel now is a big void, like I'm in a nightmare,’ Larrieu told the Sun-Sentinal. ‘Someone in a 20-second interval completely took (him) from me,’ Larrieu told NBC Miami, ‘his absence will be missed forever.’","The Ferrari's driver fled the scene, leaving authorities stumped as to how he or she escaped .

HI-SEAS (Hawaii Space Exploration Analog and Simulation) aims to address problems that may be encountered in future space missions by simulating exploration in areas of the world similar to space environments. The aim of this first mission, funded by NASA’s Human Research Program, the University of Hawaii and Cornell University, was to learn about living and cooking in Mars. Scroll down for video .

The volcano is a barren landscape, an abandoned quarry with little vegetation that's as similar to Mars' landscape as planet Earth can get. The crew members have been living under Mars-like conditions. According to HI-SEAS 'communication latencies and blackouts, in close quarters, under strict water-use rules, etc' are part of the deal.

The freeze-dried vegetables were a big hit, he said, and were used in almost every meal. But, he added, 'The freeze-dried meat is only really enjoyable when used in meals. In itself it’s too bland and hardly has any aroma.' There were also some meals that the crew won't be advocating for a real mission to Mars.

Some crew members have been practicing terrain exploration, leaving their habitat and venturing outside, fully kitted out in their spacesuits, onto the barren lava field to conduct experiments with thermal imaging, geological identification, and microbiological detection.

The structure of the CMB, the oldest light in the universe, is displayed in the high-latitude regions of the map. The central band is the plane of our Galaxy . ‘We found that the standard picture of an early universe, in . which radiation domination was followed by matter domination, holds to the . level we can test it with the new data,’ said Eric Linder, a theoretical . physicist at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. ‘But there are hints that radiation didn't give way to . matter exactly as expected,’ he added. ‘There appears to be an excess dash of radiation that is not . due to CMB photons.’ Currently, our knowledge of the Big Bang and the early . formation of the universe stems almost entirely from measurements of the CMB. These are primordial photons set free when the universe . cooled enough for particles of radiation and particles of matter to separate. The elusive subatomic neutrino tracks showing electrons and muons caught in a nano second. Neutrinos are the second most populous residents of today's universe, after photons . These measurements reveal the CMB's influence on the growth . and development of the large-scale structure we see in the universe today. Using the latest satellite data from the European Space . Agency's Planck mission and NASA's Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), . Linder, working with Alireza Hojjati and Johan Samsing, analysed CMB . measurements to higher resolution, lower noise, and more sky coverage than ever . before. ‘With the Planck and WMAP data we're really pushing back the . frontier and looking further back in the history of the universe, to regions of . high energy physics we previously could not access,’ said Linder. ‘While our analysis shows the CMB photon relic afterglow of . the Big Bang being followed mainly by dark matter as expected, there was also a . deviation from the standard that hints at relativistic particles beyond CMB . light.’ This map shows the oldest light in our universe, as detected with the greatest precision yet. The ancient light, called the cosmic microwave background, was imprinted on the sky when the universe was 370,000 years old. It shows tiny temperature fluctuations that correspond to regions of slightly different densities . Linder suggests the reason behind these relativistic . particles are early versions of neutrinos, the phantom-like subatomic particles . that are the second most populous residents of today's universe. Another theory is dark energy, the anti-gravitational force . that accelerates our universe's expansion. ‘Early dark energy is a class of explanations for the origin . of cosmic acceleration that arises in some high energy physics models,’ said . Linder. ‘While conventional dark energy, such as the cosmological . constant, are diluted to one part in a billion of total energy density around . the time of the CMB's last scattering, early dark energy theories can have . 1-to-10 million times more energy density.’ Linder believes early dark energy could have been the driver . that seven billion years later caused the present cosmic acceleration. Its actual discovery would not only provide new insight into . the origin of cosmic acceleration, but perhaps also provide new evidence for . string theory and other concepts in high energy physics. ‘New experiments for measuring CMB polarisation that are . already underway, such as the POLARBEAR and SPTpol telescopes, will enable us . to further explore primeval physics,’ Linder said.","Study involved an analysis of thermal radiation left over from the Big Bang .

The excess radiation found may have been due to early neutrinos or dark energy- providing a new insight into the origin of cosmic acceleration ."

A&E units will not cope with the surge in patients this winter unless bosses make urgent changes, MPs have warned. Just one in six casualty units has enough consultants working during its busiest hours and most are ‘relying too heavily’ on junior doctors. A report published today warns of an impending ‘crisis’ as more than 100,000 patients now spend at least four hours in A&E every month. A&E: MPs are warning that NHS bosses must quickly draw up plans on how they will cope with the expected rise in patients this winter . It says the launch of the NHS 111 helpline made problems worse as unqualified call centre workers sent patients unnecessarily to casualty. MPs on the health select committee say NHS bosses must quickly draw up plans on how they will cope with the expected rise in patients this winter. Their report revealed how consultants may be absent for the 16 busiest hours of the day – between 8am and midnight – in 83 per cent of casualty departments. But to cover gaps in rotas, trusts are spending about £500,000 a year on locum doctors who tend not to be as skilled, it said. Junior doctors do 12-hour shifts without breaks and many work seven nights in a row ‘under intense pressure’, it added. The report comes as the number of emergency cases is soaring. A lack of GP out-of-hours services has been blamed for patients increasingly arriving at A&Es with non-urgent problems. A report says the launch of the NHS 111 helpline made problems worse as unqualified call centre workers sent patients unnecessarily to A&E . And Britain’s ageing population has led to rising numbers of elderly people being admitted for long-term treatment. Winter this year was particularly busy, with many staff reporting departments at breaking point as they dealt with cases of flu, chest infections and the vomiting bug norovirus. Although summer is usually quieter, the . heatwave has triggered a surge of patients suffering from sunstroke, . heart problems and allergies. Dr Cliff Mann, of the College of Emergency Medicine, warned that staffing levels ‘had come to a crisis’. He claimed the methods used to plug rota gaps were ‘untenable and unsustainable’. Tory MP Stephen Dorrell, chairman of the health select committee, said: ‘The system is “flying blind” without adequate information about the nature of the demand being placed upon it. The committee is mindful of pressures which will build during next winter and is concerned that current plans lack sufficient urgency.’ He said he was ‘not convinced’ that the plans so far presented to him by NHS chiefs, senior GPs and ambulance bosses were ‘adequate’. Last winter, many A&E departments were reported to be at breaking point as they dealt with cases of flu, chest infections and the vomiting bug norovirus (picture posed by models) Britain's ageing population means rising numbers of elderly people inevitably require treatment . He added: ‘We think it is extraordinary that consultant coverage for a minimum of 16 hours a day during the working week is guaranteed in only 17 per cent of designated A&E departments. The figure is even lower at weekends and there are high vacancy rates for senior staff and consultants leading, inevitably, to high locum costs. ‘We know that early assessment by a senior clinician can improve outcomes and accelerate a patient’s progress through hospital, but for this to happen there must be sufficient numbers of senior staff in the emergency department.’ MPs also said the NHS 111 helpline was in the ‘last chance saloon’, although they claimed it has the potential to work. Hospital watchdog Monitor says £500million should be spent recruiting 10,000 extra staff including 1,100 consultants, 1,300 junior doctors and 4,000 nurses and midwives. Dame Barbara Hakin, the chief operating officer of NHS England, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's very disappointing that accident and emergency departments don't have as much consultant cover as we would all wish them to have. 'We need to work much harder at making this an attractive profession for young doctors, so we can recruit them. 'Inevitably if you have a situation where you don't have the best possible resource, then that can compromise making sure patients get the best treatment. 'We need to do two things about this. First and foremost, we need to look at how we can make our accident and emergency departments the very best they can be, which means improving recruitment. 'But also, we need to make sure that the patients who don't need to be there and don't want to be there aren't. That's about tackling issues in general practice, in community services and in social care which will help to keep the patients that we are most concerned about - the vulnerable and the elderly - in their own homes.' Dame Barbara agreed there were 'difficulties' with the roll-out of the 111 service, adding: 'If certain providers had done what they said that they were going to do and had the call handlers in place to talk to patients, then it would have been fine. That didn't happen. 'But we were able within a very few weeks to get a really great service, and the 111 service is now stable.'","More than 100,000 patients wait for 4hours or more every month .

The meteor fireball that crashed into Russia in February was part of a 656-foot wide asteroid called 2011 EO40. Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor that were scattered across the Russian town of Chelyabinsk, where the meteor landed, and claim it came from the large Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed Earth as it orbits the sun. They added that the piece may have broken off because of the stress caused by the gravitaional pull of the planets and the sun, or could have been caused by the asteroid hitting into something else during its orbit. Scroll down for video . The meteor fireball, pictured, that crashed into Russia in February was part of a 656-feet wide asteroid called 2011 EO40. Spanish astrophysicists analysed fragments of the meteor and claim it came from the Apollo asteroid that regularly crosses passed Earth as it orbits the sun . Experts said the meteor that left a 50-foot hole in a frozen lake on the outskirts of Chelyabinsk, in the Urals, weighed around 100,000 tonnes and measured 55 feet in diameter . This caused the fragment to separate off and plummet towards Earth. The meteor fireball, also known as a superbolide, was seen over Chelyabinsk in the south of the country near the border of Kazakhstan and around 900 miles east of Moscow. It exploded over Russia's Ural Mountains and is the biggest space rock to have hit . earth in more than a century. The 10,000 tonne rock, measuring . around 55 feet in diameter, created a huge hole in a frozen lake when it . crashed into the ground. Over 1,000 people were injured by the exploding rock and scientists managed to recover more than 50 tiny fragments of the meteor, allowing them to study its contents and origin. Nasa scientists at the time said the shockwave caused by the crash was greater than 30 Hiroshima nuclear bombs and was so powerful it travelled twice around the world. The Russian meteor hit the Earth just hours before an asteroid called 2012 DA14 was spotted nearby but the two incidents were not found to be related. Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the expedition from Urals Federal University in February following the crash, said that 53 fragments of the meteor have been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake . In February divers searched the waters beneath the ice for traces of space rock but surfaced empty handed, leaving some experts questioning whether the hole was indeed formed by a piece of falling debris . Professor Carlos de la Fuente Marcos and his brother Raul from the University of Madrid identified 20 possible sources from a cluster of asteroids dubbed Chelyabinsk asteroid family. They . told The Telegraph: 'The most probable parent body for the Chelyabinsk . superbolide is 2011 EO40. Under such conditions, the cluster cannot be . older than about 20,000–40,000 years.' However, the only way to confirm this theory, claims Marcos, would be to go into space and take samples of the 2011 EO40 asteroid. German . scientists are also set to publish finding later this year that claim . the meteor was made of a stony material called chondrite breccias.Most asteroids are made up of boulders, dust and ice. Professor . Carlos de la Fuente Marcos added that another similar incident is . 'unlikely' but smaller fragments might crash to Earth as the asteroid . continues its orbit. The meteor caused widespread property damage in Chelyabinsk city, with health officials saying that 46 of the injured remain . hospitalised. The debris narrowly missed a direct . and devastating hit on the industrial city which has a population of . 1.13 million but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit . up with a blinding flash. Service pieces of a meteorite are displayed in a laboratory in Yekaterinburg after being recovered from near Lake Cherbarkul in the Chelyabinsk region. A total of 53 pieces have been brought for analysis to the university in Yekaterinburg . Paul Chodas of NASA's Near-Earth Object Program Office said at the time: 'We would expect an event of this magnitude to occur once every 100 years.' He told the Wall Street Journal: . 'When you have a fireball of this size we would expect a large number . of meteorites to reach the surface and in this case there were probably . some large ones.' Viktor Grokhovsky, who led the . expedition from Urals Federal University, said that 53 fragments of the . meteor had been plucked from the ice-covered Chebarkul Lake. The local governor estimated the . damage at 1 billion rubles (£21.5million) and said he hopes the federal . government will provide at least half that amount. The debris from the crash in February narrowly missed a direct and devastating hit on the industrial city of Chelyabinsk, which has a population of 1.13 million, but spread panic through its streets as the sky above lit up with a blinding flash . Lidiya Rykhlova, head of the . astronomy department at the Moscow-based Institute for Space Research, . said experts have drafted a program that envisages building powerful . telescopes, including space-based ones, to warn against potentially . dangerous asteroids, comets and other threats. As it raced through the sky, the . 50-foot wide chunk of space rock compressed the air ahead of it, . creating the enormous temperatures that meant it exploded in a fireball . somewhere between 18 and 32 miles above the ground at around 9.20am . local time on 19 February. Although . some debris fell to earth, ‘whipping up a pillar of ice, water and . steam’ and creating a 20-foot-wide crater, the damage in nearby towns . was actually caused by shockwaves created by the meteor breaking the sound barrier and then exploding.

In October a 9in piece . of the Seymchan meteorite found in Siberia in 1960 sold in New York for . $43,750 (£28,200). Astronomers have also revealed that the meteor could have hit UK cities if it had hit at a slightly different time of day. The city of Chelyabinsk, 900 miles east of Moscow and close to the Kazakhstan border, took the brunt of the impact . Local residents said they witnessed burning objects in the sky of the Chelyabinsk and Sverdlovsk regions .","Experts say the meteor weighed 10,000 tonnes and was 55 feet wide .

Many of the applications that have been rejected have been deemed inappropriate - one game involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls' skirts on the screen, for example. And while others may not have been lewd, they were either entirely bizarre or even dangerous. The Tawkon Radiation Detector app, pictured, was rejected because it could be used to calculate how much radiation was being emitted by mobiles and mobile phone masts.

It used the device's built-in accelerometer to determine how high into the air it is thrown, but Apple rejected it because it could cause damage to the devices or to the users . To be accepted onto the App Store, apps must be functional in that they must not crash, include hidden features or work in a way other than what the developer advertised. They must also have a user function and developers can't charge for app that doesn't do anything.

For example, apps that were considered 'offensive' or to contain adult or mature content, and were subsequently rejected, include iBoobs, an app that involved shaking the phone to make a pair of virtual breasts move, and PinPoints X that used GPS to plot the location of sex adverts around cities. There was also the Puff app that involved causing a gust of air to lift up girls' skirts on the screen and Video Strip Poker app that would remove clothing from a virtual model each time a user won a card hand. Other apps that contained less obvious adult content but were still rejected included PopCap's Unpleasant Horse game. It involves riding a horse through clouds and sending ponies to their death by jumping on them. Although it was initially rejected for containing 'mature content', this decision was appealed and the app was later accepted.

Following a petition on Change.org, though, the app was removed. A revised version was submitted and a counter-petition was filed with 48,000 signatures in support of keeping the app on the App Store but The Manhattan Declaration app was rejected on the basis it was offensive to 'large groups of people.'

Scientists are not sure why they do this, but there are various theories as to why it could be. Researchers at California State University have suggested that it could be be a crude tool for allowing the creatures to work out when a night is too bright for them to safely venture out. Another popular theory is that the glowing is a form of protection from the sun - that it allows the scorpions to convert harmful UV rays into harmless visible light. The fluorescence is caused by chemicals in the cuticles of the scorpions hard outer body parts. As a scorpion matures the intensity of the fluorescence increases. Leanne Thompson, Reptile Keeper at Chessington World of Adventures Resort told MailOnline: 'There is no proven reason as to why they glow but one popular belief is that they glow so that individual scorpions can see each other in the dark. 'New-born Laos Forrest Scorpion do not glow and it’s believed that this is so other adults can’t seem them and try and eat them.' Researchers at California State University suggested that it could be be a crude tool for allowing them to work out when a night is too bright for them to safely go out. The scientists believe that the scorpions cannot see UV light so would be unable to tell whether it was a bright night. Therefore, they think they evolved the ability to glow under UV light as they can see themselves glowing green and are alerted to the danger. Another popular theory is that the glowing is a form of protection from the sun - that it allows the scorpions to convert harmful UV rays into harmless visible light. Although scientists don't know why the scorpion glows, they do know how. Scorpions have fluorescent chemicals . in the cuticle of their sclertie, or hardened body parts, and these chemicals include beta-carboline. The fluorescence occurs as a . result of sclerotisation, which is the process of the body part hardening. As the scorpion matures and moves through its development stages, called instars, the intensity of the glow increases. The predatory arthropod is usually found in peaty areas of Laos and Vietnam and can reach the length of 12 cm. The species tends to live in groups, but is thought to show cannibalistic tendencies. Pictures have been taken of an amazing, glowing scorpion at Chessington World of Adventures. It is a Laos Black Forest Scorpion which glows under UV light . If they are caught, they can be extremely aggressive, especially towards other scorpions, predators such as meerkats and a particular type of centipede called Scolopendra. Heterometrus laoticus are part of the Heterometrus family of giant forest scorpions and is known to contain some of the largest scorpions on earth. Despite their behaviour, most do not have a fatal sting. The symptoms from a Heterometrus sting are classed as mild and there have been no reported human fatalities. However, the sting can cause local pain, inflammation, swelling and redness of the skin and these symptoms can last for days. Scorpions have been found in many fossil records and the oldest known scorpions lived around 430 million years ago on the bottom of shallow tropical seas. These pictures have been released to celebrate the BIAZA (British & Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums) Big Bug Bonanza at Chessington World of Adventures Resort until 11th August.

A churchgoing mother has won a £20,000 unfair dismissal case after she was wrongfully accused of viewing hardcore porn at work. Elaine Buckley, 50, has been married for almost 30 years and regularly fundraises in her local community. But in 2010 the finance manager was called into her boss’s office to explain why she had been looking at porn sites during working hours. She strenuously denied the claims but her employers at Waters Edge Ceramics, a dental laboratory in Oldham, fired her for gross misconduct. Elaine Buckley, 50, was wrongly accused of watching porn at work . The mother-of-two said: ‘The whole experience has been so humiliating. I was just horrified when they first told me of the allegations. 'I am a normal 50-year-old mum. I like . walking my dog, spending time with my children and friends and generally . being a mum - not looking at pornography. 'I believe that what happens between a woman and a man or a man and a man or two women in their bedroom should be kept private between them.' Mrs Buckley said that in November 2010 the company announced that redundancies would take place. A week later she exchanged cross words with Gemma Taylor, her boss’s daughter, who had been brought in as her line manager after finishing university. The next day she was invited for a disciplinary meeting at which it was revealed that her computer had been used to view hardcore pornography. IT consultant Paul Burton printed off . a report of her computer use - which revealed that the machine had been . used to view hard-core pornography. Elaine said: ‘They kept using the words ""obscene"" and ""pornographic"" websites. ‘If . it was a cooking website then that might make sense because I could be . looking up a recipe for a colleague but not a pornography site. ‘I . kept denying it. I couldn’t understand why they thought I had been on . the sites. I had been working with the company for ten years, they knew . me. ‘My computer was used by other people too and the site could have been a pop up site where the cookies saved to the machine. ‘But they didn’t believe me. It was such a dark, dark time for me.’ Waters Edge Ceramics (pictured) dismissed Mrs Buckley (pictured above) after accusing her of watching porn at work . On November 11, Elaine was handed . with two letters announcing her suspension. On 17 December, she was . sacked from her role by a further letter. It . stated that she had ‘accessed inappropriate and obscene websites’, . spent a ‘wholly unacceptable’ amount of time on personal sites and . failed to follow an order not to do so. Elaine . tried to appeal within the company but was unsuccessful and so took . Waters Edge Ceramics to employment tribunal in February 2011. Manchester . Alexandra House heard that the sites could have been accessed by pop-up . sites that Elaine did not know were there or other people who used the . computer. The hearing was told the company had no evidence that Elaine had viewed pornography. On . November 2, 2011, Employment Judge Diana Kloss recorded that Mrs . Buckley was ‘unfairly dismissed’ under section 98(4) of the Employment . Rights Act 1996. Mrs . Buckley, who has undergone counselling as a result of the ordeal, said: . ‘Going to the tribunal was nerve wracking.

As ocean and air temps rise, more methane-rich material like . permafrost and hydrates melt. Methane traps more heat than carbon, and . speeds the warming. This amplification effect means drastic warming can . be triggered much faster than current models predict, some scientists claim. 'It it is not an exaggeration to suggest, based on best available scientific evidence, that burning all fossil fuels could result in the planet being not only ice-free but human-free,' he claims. 'If we burn all the fossil fuels it is certain that sea level would eventually rise by tens of meters,' he claims. 'The only argument is how soon the rise of several meters needed to destroy habitability of all coastal cities would occur.

A Cambridge educated City intern has appeared in court after drunkenly threatening another student with a knife in a row over a girl. Luke Haggerty had been ‘stupidly drunk’ as he celebrated on the night of his graduation in June and made unwanted advances to another student’s girlfriend. The other student rebuffed him and Haggerty staggered into the street where police spotted him and escorted him home. But while at home he grabbed a kitchen knife and returned to the Balare nightclub in Cambridge where he confronted the other student who ran away. Haggerty, 22, was too drunk to give chase and was arrested by police who charged him with possession of an offensive weapon. The court heard he had stocked shelves to fund his dream of studying at Cambridge after gaining straight A-grades at his grammar school. He wept in the dock at Cambridge Crown Court as he admitted the offence and was given a suspended sentence by Recorder John Foy QC. Haggerty became so distressed he began to hyperventilate and was allowed to sit down by the judge. Caroline Allison, mitigating, said Haggerty had attended a state-funded grammar school in Yorkshire and achieved his dream of going to Cambridge. He graduated in Economics from Trinity College and narrowly missed a first-class degree. She said: 'This is not what some of the public might think of as a posh lad who has had every opportunity and thrown it away with no thought at all.' The 22 year old had stocked shelves to fund his dream of studying at Cambridge after gaining straight A-grades at his grammar school . She said Haggerty was devastated by the 'stigma, upset and shame' his behaviour had brought on his family and on the university.

Brave: Victim of abuse John McCabe has successfully campaigned for a new police investigation into sex crimes at a Durham borstal . A borstal boy who was among hundreds abused by a paedophile ring in prison while police allegedly turned a blind eye has won a campaign to have the case re-opened. John McCabe was sexually assaulted at 17 at the Medomsley Detention Centre, County Durham, by members of a gang he said raped him 'every single day'. Police have re-launched their investigation after complaints were ignored, amid claims many boys were systematically abused by 'agents of the state' in the 1970s and 1980s. Two prison officers were jailed after a 2003 investigation, Lesley Johnson for six years and warden Neville Husband for 12 years. It was Husband who abused Mr McCabe. But at least four other staff were said to be involved and in one case a victim allegedly spoke to police about being abused in the 1970s and was told to 'f*** off' or he’d be sent back to prison. Mr McCabe, who suffered six months of attacks and has waived his right to anonymity to tell his story, told the Daily Mirror: 'I was asked to work in the kitchens. That’s where I met him (Husband). He told me if I didn’t do what he wanted he’d kill me and nobody would care. ‘I thought I was the only boy he abused. Now I know there were more. A lot more. And it wasn’t just him. 'I’m fighting for justice for those boys, for myself. Too many people have got away with this for far too long.' John went to the police in 2009 after Husband was released, but the Crown Prosecution Service took no action, leaving him 'devastated'. Shame: Boys were abused at the Medomsley Detention Centre, near Consett, County Durham, in the 1970s and 1980s . His local MP, Michael McCann, Labour's representative in East Kilbride, Strathaven and Lesmahagow, has helped his constituent with the campaign. He told MailOnline: 'John and I have carried this on and want to help in any way we can. 'If anyone has any information about abuse inside the detention centre or outside we would like them to tell the police. 'There were two convicted but we know there were others who carried out abuse and were never brought to justice. 'John has been incredibly brave in talking about what happened to him and I hope that it will inspire bravery in others. 'There were people who were abused by agents of the state and when they tried to get help it was refused. I don't believe that will happen now'. Paedophile: Prison guard Neville Husband (left) was jailed for 8 years for his abuse, but Michael McCann MP (right) is helping with the new campaign for justice as he says more men were involved . Police are appealing for any victims to come forward. Det Supt Paul Goundry, head of safeguarding for Durham Constabulary said: 'Neville Husband preyed on some of the most vulnerable children and young people in our society and left many of them with mental scars which have lasted a lifetime. 'While we contacted and took statements from a number of victims as part of this investigation, we believe there are others who for whatever reason have never come forward. It is those people we are now asking to contact us and pass on any information about what took place during their time at Medomsley, whether it happened at the centre or off-site. I can assure them we have experienced officers on hand to talk to them and they will be treated with the utmost sensitivity. 'What happened at Medomsley was organised abuse on a large scale and we are committed to ensuring every victim feels they have had the opportunity to speak. Throughout our enquiries we will be in constant touch with the CPS who will ultimately advise on whether there are grounds to bring criminal charges. 'John has shown great bravery in giving up his right to anonymity and talking about the abuse he suffered. I hope that by doing so he will encourage others to come forward and pass on any information they have.'

Smooth-talking: Roy Moyse has been given 28 days to pay victim Karen Culverwell the measly sum of a £1 . A serial conman who wiped out a wealthy divorcee of 125,000 pounds which he blew on gambling has been ordered to pay her back just one pound. Roy Moyse has been given 28 days to pay victim Karen Culverwell the measly sum after a court heard he had no assets to his name which he could give her. The smooth-talking charlatan had just been released from prison for a string of similarcons on other vulnerable women when he targeted Mrs Culverwell, 50. He moved in with her in Christchurch, Dorset, after discovering she was divorcing her company director husband and was due for a large settlement. During their short-term relationship he convinced her to loan him money and give him access to her bank account. He went on to completely wipe out her divorce settlement and savings which went on paying off his gambling debts. Moyse, 45, was jailed again for two years in May after pleading guilty to six counts of fraud. He reappeared at Bournemouth Crown Court for a confiscation hearing to determine how much money he should repay Mrs Culverwell. A judge ordered him to pay her the token sum of £1 as that is all he could afford right now. The judge, Recorder James Waddington, told him: 'I’m satisfied there should be a confiscation order in this case of one pound, there being no other assets in your case. 'I will give you 28 days to make good on that.' Fraudster Roy Moyse pictured with his first wife Julie in June 1991. The serial conman went on to wipe out a wealthy divorcee of £125,000 which he blew on gambling . Moyse was told that if he ever comes into money or assets in the future he must pay Mrs Culverwell as much as he can at that time, even if he is ever declared bankrupt. After the hearing, Roger Doerr, financial investigator at the Dorset Police fraud unit, said: 'He has no assets so we can’t restrain any money. 'But £1 is something anyone can afford and this will set him on the road to paying off the full amount. Moyse has been given 28 days to pay victim Karen Culverwell the measly sum of a £1 . 'We have gone through a Proceeds of Crime Act order and he will have to pay the pound back within the time frame or he will get another week in prison. 'If he comes into money, by winning the lottery for example, we can revisit him for the £125,000. If he doesn’t pay it, he will go back to prison. 'The order will be in place for life or until it is paid off. We can chase him to his grave. 'If the order was not granted then we couldn’t chase him. It is a means that we can keep control of his finances.' Moyse met mother-of-two Mrs Culverwell in August 2010 after she split up with her long-time husband Robert and the pair began dating. Between September 2010 and March 2011, she made numerous small loans to him which he failed to pay back. In September 2011, Mrs Culverwell received her divorce settlement and was persuaded by Moyse to place the money in an internet account and give him access. He then made numerous unauthorised transfers from the account to his own. Mrs Culverwell only realised his deceit two years into their relationship when she tried to take out a mortgage on a new house and was told there was nothing left in her account. She declined to make any comment on the case. Moyse began his cons on women by hanging around the millionaire’s playground of Sandbanks to pick out potential victims, usually in wine bars. He either used to claim he was a barrister or a businessman who was waiting for a big business deal to go through. He was jailed in 2008 for three years for conning four women out of 50,000 pounds but was released after serving just over 12 months in prison.","Roy Moyse has been given 28 days to pay victim Karen Culverwell .

A 12-year-old boy is fighting for his life after developing a rare infection caused by an amoeba attacking and eating his brain. Zachary Reyna fell critically ill after playing on a knee board with friends in a ditch near his LaBelle, Florida home. If he recovers from the infection caused by the brain-eating amoeba he will be only the four person to have survived. Fighter: Zachary Reyna is in intensive care after contracting a rare infection from a deadly amoeba . Risks: Zachary is being treated in hospital, above, for an infection only three people are known to have survived . The single cell Naegleria Fowleri or brain-eating amoeba, lives in warm fresh water and attacks the brain after entering the body through the nose, according to Naples News. In the past 50 years only 31 have contracted the rare primary amoebic meningoencephalitis (Pam) infection, and only three have survived so far. 'He can be number four. That's what we're hoping for, for him to be number four,' Zachary's brother, Brandon Villarreal, said. The family first noticed there was something seriously wrong with Zachary after he slept for a whole day after playing with friends on August 3. At first they thought he had a 24 hour virus, but soon realized there was something seriously wrong with the usually active, baseball loving child. Vigil: The family of the 12-year-old, pictured with his sister, are staying by his bedside. He became sick after playing in a ditch with friends . 'I wish I could just touch him and it would transfer over. It don't work like that,' Brandon told ABC7. 'It's just tough to see him like this.' Primary amoebic meningoencephalitis is as rare as it is horrific. It is caused by an amoeba that implants itself in its victim's brains - usually when infected water shoots up their nose. The amoeba grows in the sediment at the bottom of pools of warm, stagnant water and is most active at about 85F. The water must reach a relatively high temperature for the parasites to reach numbers that threaten humans. Health officials have recorded only 125 instances of the disease in the United States in the past 50 years. Only two people have survived in the U.S. One other survivor was found in Mexico . Swimmers can reduce their risk by: . The family have been keeping a vigil by his bedside at Miami Children's Hospital, where Zachary has been sedated. '[It] . will actually eat away at the tissue; it literally eats the tissues,' Dr Mark Heulitt told KATV. 'It is a severe form of meningitis where your . brain will be eaten by the amoeba.' Brandon is positive that his little brother, who loves to play baseball, will pull through. 'He's fighting and he's strong, he's really, really strong,' he said. Swimmers have been warned to be careful in still water around Florida, as health officials try to prevent further infections. The amoeba is common in warm, stagnant water in central Florida, especially in the summer. Health officials have advised swimmers and water skiers to wear nose clips as a safety precaution because it cuts off the only way the amoeba can enter the body and do damage. A Department of Health spokesman told MailOnline the water must to be forcefully, almost violently, pushed up the nose - as it can be after diving into the water, being dunked or using a water slide. Three boys, aged between 10 and 14, developed the infection last year after wakeboarding or swimming. Mark Zeitler, whose nephew of Will Sellers, who died from the infection last year, has warned people to stay away from water in the summer. 'We're not trying to be alarmists, but . as that water heats up, find other places to recreate,' Mr Zeitler told . the Orlando Sentinel. Warning signs: Zachary's family realized he was sick when the usually active child could not stop sleeping . It can take up to a week for the infection to show symptoms, which include headaches, fever, vomiting and seizures. A 12-year-old girl who developed the condition in July is still in hospital after managing to fight off the infection. Kali Hardig came in contact with the amoeba as she swam in a sandy bottom lake at Willow Springs Water Park near Little Rock, Arkansas.","Only three people have survived primary amoebic meningoencephalitis .

The woman is understood to have broken into the house through a downstairs window as the star was watching television in his lounge. He told a friend: 'It was an absolutely terrifying experience. Seeing this woman standing there in my house was like something out of a horror movie. 'It was frightening but I’m going to take it as a warning. In some ways I’ve been lucky. You have to look on the positive side because it could have been a whole lot worse. I now know that I need to improve my security. She could have had a gun.' It was initially believed by those close to Cowell that the intruder was an 'over-zealous fan.' After getting into the £9million property – once described by Cowell as 'safe as the Bank of England' – the woman is said to have gone from room to room. According to a source, at one point she was 'lying on Simon’s bed in his bedroom'. She also managed to get into a bathroom.

Bizarre: Nathan Meunch arrives at Shrewsbury Crown Court with a paper bag over his head despite being pictured at an earlier hearing . Two fraudsters who tried to pass off ice cubes as iPads but were rumbled when they melted have been spared jail. Nathan Meunch, 29, and Nigel Bennett, 39, walked into a post office with a parcel claiming they were posting iPads. But in fact they had stuffed the package with ice cubes before sending it via Special Delivery on May 14 last year. They hoped to log an insurance claim with Royal Mail claiming £2,500 of iPads had been mislaid. But the pair were unaware the soggy parcel had burst behind the counter at the post office in Whitchurch, Shropshire. Staff became suspicious when they noticed wet patches on Meunch's jacket and alerted Royal Mail investigators. Meunch, of Leegomery, Telford, was found guilty of fraud following a trial. He turned up at court on Friday wearing a bizarre paper bag disguise just weeks after posing for pictures at an earlier hearing. Meanwhile Bennett, of Stirchley, West Midlands, pleaded guilty to the same charge. Both men received a 12-month community order and 150 hours of unpaid work. They were also ordered to pay £500 towards prosecution costs within six months. Recorder Mr Christopher Hotten QC told them: 'You, Mr Bennett, accept responsibility for the idea of this offence. 'You were short of money and you wanted to make some money. 'You prepared a package containing ice cubes which was represented to contain iPad screens. 'You, Mr Meunch, took it to the post office and dispatched it and it was you who submitted a compensation claim. 'The plan was unsuccessful. The ice melted and the post office were quite well aware within an hour that this was a scam.' Rumbled: Nathan Meunch (left) and Nigel Bennett (right) tried to pass off ice cubes as iPads . During the trial the court heard the parcel had 'disintegrated' in front of shocked postal workers. Counter clerk Elaine Sloane, told the court how she served Meunch, on May 14, 2012 and noticed damp spots on his jacket. She said: 'I just happened to say to the gentleman is it raining outside and he said yes but it seemed strange to me because I could see from where I was sitting it didn't look like it was raining.' 'I asked him what was inside and he said iPads. 'About an hour later, a colleague noticed a puddle of water beneath the Special Delivery pile. 'We had a little look and you could see all ice in there. 'He had sent it as iPads and I couldn't believe it was all this water and the box was disintegrating.' Denis Desmond, defending Bennett, said: 'The reason he did this was he was running a music hall and could not raise the money to rent the venue. 'He hatched this not just unsuccessful but rather pathetic plan.' The court heard in 2008 Bennett, an engineer, was jailed for three years for possession with intent to supply ecstasy.","Nathan Meunch and Nigel Bennett claimed they were posting iPads .

'A 'fruitcake test' has been used by the UK Independence Party to uncover unsuitable characters who might embarrass the party. Psychometric tests were used to analyse the personalities, reliability and honesty of more than 300 people wanting to run in next year’s European elections. Experts were called in to prevent a repeat of May’s local elections when UKIP candidates were accused of sexism, racism and homophobia. But one candidate who passed with flying colours was Godfrey Bloom, the sitting MEP who last week railed against Britain giving aid to ‘Bongo Bongo land’. Pass: UKIP's Godfrey Bloom cleared the party's psychometric testing, but last week caused a political storm after complaining about British aid being sent to Bongo Bongo land . UKIP leader Nigel Farage ordered a shake-up of the party selection process to weed out people with views which risked living up to David Cameron’s infamous claim that the party was a ‘bunch of fruitcakes, loonies and closet racists’. A professional recruitment company was hired to oversee the process, ahead of elections to the European Parliament in May 2014. Many predict UKIP could top the poll – forcing the Tories into second place- but such success will bring unprecedented levels of scrutiny.

Information testScour a bundle of information and give a pithy response, in line with party policy . At a gruelling bootcamp candidates faced . 160 questions about their personalities, where they were asked to rank . their responses from 1 to 7. The answers were then analysed to see if they were consistent to weed out anyone displaying dishonest traits or ‘game’ the system. Would-be politicians went on to face a series of tasks to see if they could cope with the pressure of being a UKIP representative. It included a series of grillings by a panel of party bigwigs, and mock media interviews to see how they would fare being torn apart by a Jeremy Paxman or John Humphrys. A writing test challenged them to produce a press release which might get used by local newspapers. In another section, each candidate was given a large bundle of information from which they had to produce a pithy response, which was in line with party policy. As the 300 were whittled down to just 77, successful candidates included Daily Express journalist Patrick O’Flynn, Mr Bloom and Mr Farage. But Mike Nattrass, currently UKIP MEP for the West Midlands, did not make the grade. Journalist James Delingpole, who boasted on his application form that his skills include 'winding up greenies or lefties', was also rejected. In a letter to members he said: '‘I’ve just this second had a call from [UKIP chairman] Steve Crowther telling me I didn’t make the cut anyway. 'Apparently – quelle surprise! – I did well on the public speaking bit; but fell down on the psychometric testing (!) and the interviews. 'Seems what you’re looking for is solid candidates with years of party membership and proven dedication to the nitty gritty of party business. Well if those are your criteria, you’ve certainly done the right thing!’ Former Tory MP Neil Hamilton was not included on the list, but Mr Farage is reportedly planning a 'different leading role for the party'. Thumbs down: The new process ordered by UKIP leader Nigel Farage saw just 77 out of 300 wannabe politicians make it through to the next stage . To even get to the stage of being . considered for selection to stand in the MEP elections, they first had . to have passed a test set for anyone wanting to be a UKIP MP. This included five tests covering knowledge of party policy, media scrutiny and public speaking. Only those who achieved an A grade even made it on to the long list to try to stand for Brussels. The . final list of approved candidates will now be sent to every UKIP . member, who will vote on who should top the lists in each region for the . European elections. During the local elections, UKIP candidates were suspended or investigated after being pictured making a Nazi salute, denying the Holocaust or having links to the BNP. The party leadership hopes the tough new tests will prevent future similar embarrassment, but cannot guarantee it. ‘No system designed by man will ever be foolproof,’ said a source. Meanwhile a UKIP local council candidate is to be charged over claims that he used fake signatures on his election nomination form. Hugh Mennie, who stood for election to Cambridgeshire County Council in May, is accused of causing or permitting a false statement to appear in a nomination paper.","Personality quiz used to check the honesty and reliability of politicians .

British warships headed to the Mediterranean yesterday, as David Cameron prepared to sue Spain over its treatment of Gibraltar. The Prime Minister has ordered government lawyers and Foreign Office officials to draw up plans for legal action. He has finally lost patience with the Spanish after they continued to impose what he sees as illegal border checks, which break European Union rules on the free movement of people. En route: The helicopter carrier HMS Illustrious departing Portsmouth yesterday . Taking the case to the European Court of Justice would mark the first time Britain has taken a fellow EU nation to court. The plans emerged as a Royal Navy taskforce, including the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and two frigates, set sail for Gibraltar. The journey is part of a long-planned exercise – but government officials say the show of force may help ‘focus minds’ in Spain. Britain’s ambassador Giles Paxman, brother of Newsnight presenter Jeremy, informed the Spanish of the intention to go to court yesterday afternoon. Government lawyers were last night deciding whether to lodge a case with the ECJ, or call for the European Commission to take action itself; senior sources told the Daily Mail that Mr Cameron demanded answers from the Foreign Office ‘by the end of the day’. Unprecedented: Prime Minister David Cameron is threatening Madrid with legal action over delays at the Spain-Gibraltar border . He is expected to consult with the attorney general Dominic Grieve today, and could make a formal announcement tomorrow. Officials are also drafting plans for political retaliation to hit Spanish interests if Madrid fails to back down. Ministers believe the Spanish have engineered the controversy to distract attention from the parlous state of its economy, and a corruption scandal engulfing the govern . A Downing Street spokesman said:  ‘Clearly the Prime Minister is disappointed by the failure of Spain to remove the additional border checks this weekend. We are now considering what legal action is open to us. This would be an unprecedented step so we want to consider it carefully.’ Exhausting: Drivers wait in the sweltering heat to enter Spain, after the Spanish authorities increased border checks at the border with Gibraltar . They said the action by the Spanish was ‘politically motivated and totally disproportionate’, and illegal under EU law. ment of prime minister Mariano Rajoy. A Whitehall source added: ‘We’re also exploring whether there are other political options we could pursue to make clear to the Spanish that the issue is putting our bilateral relations at risk, and persuade them to de-escalate the issue.’ The European Commission said it will send monitors to the border to assess the situation – but sources said these monitors would not arrive until next month at the earliest, because they are on holiday. The stand-off began when the government of Gibraltar started building an artificial reef in the waters off the Rock last month to deter Spanish fishermen, who were damaging the marine environment. Spain responded by imposing draconian border checks, and threatening to slap tolls on travellers and ban Gibraltar-bound flights from Spanish air space. Spanish media reports suggested that the case could be taken to the United Nations, with Spain and Argentina joining forces to demand sovereignty over Gibraltar and the Falkland Islands. Spanish foreign minister Jose Garcia-Margallo will sound out his Argentinian counterpart, Hector Timerman, at a meeting in Buenos Aires next month. Ignacio Ibanez, the director general for foreign affairs at Spain’s foreign ministry, said his country was ‘not worried’ about legal action. ‘We are not worried because we are convinced about what we are doing, and we know that the right is on our side,’ he said, adding that it was ‘normal’ that Spain would talk with Argentina about Gibraltar and the Falklands. Spain wants Britain to hand over Gibraltar – but it has no intention of letting go of Ceuta and Melilla, two enclaves it holds on the coast of North Africa. The tiny territories on  the Mediterranean are the subjects of a long-standing dispute with Morocco. While Britain calls Gibraltar an overseas territory, Spain claims that the cities are actually part of mainland Spain. Spanish officials say their historical claim on the areas predates the modern country of Morocco, and so refuse to give them up. Like Gibraltar, they are duty-free havens that attract smugglers. Juan Jose Improda, the regional president of Melilla, stressed that Gibraltar is classified as a ‘non-self-governing territory’ by the United Nations, meaning its status is discussed by the UN Committee on Decolonisation, while Morocco has done nothing to include Melilla and Ceuta on that list. Maria Leon, a 30-year-old born in Ceuta, said: ‘We are as Spanish as people from Madrid or Valencia.’ However, she added: ‘I do feel sympathy with the people of Gibraltar. So what if our land is at the tip of another country? I think the politicians should just leave things alone and let us get on with our lives peacefully.’ Ten British vessels with a capacity of 3,000 personnel have headed to the waters off Gibraltar. The frigate HMS Westminster and two support vessels will call in at the British base at Gibraltar for three days, beginning on August 19. Longstanding Spanish rules mean that once they call at the Rock they cannot sail directly to any Spanish sea port. London mayor Boris Johnson said the deployment should send a clear signal to the Spanish. ‘Perhaps it really is a coincidence – as the Foreign Office claims – that we have just sent a fleet of warships to Gibraltar,’ he said. ‘But I hope not. I hope that one way or another we will shortly prise Spanish hands off the throat of our colony.’","David Cameron has ordered lawyers to draw up plans for legal action .

Unions have tightened their grip on Labour and are now responsible for three-quarters of all big donations to party coffers. The Unite union, which went to war with Ed Miliband over plans to curb union influence, gave £722,195 from April to June this year. New figures reveal that even the Lib Dems have raised more from individual non-union donors than the Labour party since the election. Red Ed: Five of the biggest trade unions accounted for three-quarters of the total donations to Labour coffers in the three months to the end of June . The revelations will heap further pressure on Mr Miliband, who has faced growing criticism for his failure to set the political agenda in recent weeks. A new opinion poll shows 40 per cent of people now back David Cameron and George Osborne to run the economy, compared to just 24 per cent for Mr Miliband and shadow chancellor Ed Balls. The Labour leader is caught between trying to widen the appeal of his party while relying increasingly on trade unions to bankroll his campaign for Number 10. Most people use their will to leave money to family and friends, charities or the church. But one mystery woman decided to donate more than half a million pounds to whoever was in power. Joan LB Edwards bequeathed a sum of £520,000 to the party in government at the time of her death. But with the Tories and Lib Dems in coalition, the two parties had to share the cash. As the larger party, the Conservatives received £420,576 while the Lib Dems had £99,423. The unusual arrangement meant the money was destined for a political party rather than the government. Last year it emerged dead Britons had left the Treasury £54,000 to help pay off the ballooning national debt from beyond the grave. The Electoral Commission today released details of all donations to political parties over £7,500. In the three months to the end of June, . Labour received a total of £3,136,447 in such donations, of which 72 per cent . came from five of the biggest unions. Unite gave £772,195, the GMB £485,830, UNISON £458,080, USDAW £411,147 and the Communication Workers’ Union £143,121. Labour stressed that the figures did not include smaller donations, and said union money accounted for 25 per cent of total donations since the start of the year. Over the period Labour reduced its overdraft facilities by £2.5 million and took out two new loans of £1.22 million each with the Co-operative Bank and Unity Trust Bank. The party had outstanding loans of £12.79 million at the end of June. By contrast, the Tories are recorded as having £2.6 million of loans but have access to overdraft facilities of up to £10.13 million. Tory party chairman Grant Shapps said: ‘Despite Ed Miliband’s promise of change, these independent figures prove his Labour Party is still dominated by the trade unions. ‘They choose the candidates, pick the leader and remain Labour’s biggest donors - providing three quarters of the party's money. ‘Until Ed Miliband stops taking his union paymasters’ cash, he will be too weak to stand up for hardworking people. ‘Instead, he can only offer what the union barons want in return for their money - the same old Labour policy of more spending, more borrowing and more debt, exactly what got us into this mess in the first place.’ In the money: David Cameron's Conservatives received most in donations overall, while Nick Clegg's Lib Dems had more in donations from non-union sources than the Labour party, lead by Ed Miliband . The UK Independence Party was buoyed by donations more than doubling to £160,000. It included a single payment to its Tiverton and Honiton branch worth £50,000, the second highest payment to a local association of any party. UKIP has grown hugely in the last year, picking up an extra 15,000 members. Last month Unite general secretary Len . McCluskey aid out a £63billion shopping list of left-wing policies he . says Labour must adopt or lose millions in funding. He . said the Labour leader had to be ‘bold’ and reverse the coalition’s . benefit reforms, halt spending cuts and borrowing billions to build . 1million extra homes. Labour’s reliance on union backing means it now raises less from individuals than Nick Clegg’s Liberal Democrats. In the latest three months, the Lib Dems raised £801,000 from non-union donations while Labour received only £730,000. Since the 2010 general election the Lib Dems have raised £6million from individuals compared to £4million for Labour. And Mr Miliband has struggled to widen the supporter base, with only 305 individual Labour donors, compared to 1,077 for the Lib Dems. Even with the union barons bankrolling the party, Labour still received less than the Conservatives. David Cameron's party received a total of £4,116,006, including major donations from businessmen. The largest gifts to the Conservatives were £280,770 from co-treasurer and hedge fund boss Michael Farmer and £263,600 from investment banker James Lupton. Labour said the Tories received £1,042,970.93 in the last quarter from donors who attended private dinners with Mr Cameron and other senior ministers. It included £694,370 from donors in the financial sector. Sadiq Khan MP, Labour’s Shadow Justice Secretary, said: 'The Tories have raked in over £1 million from private dinners with David Cameron and senior Ministers in the last quarter. 'And more than two thirds of that comes from the City – the bankers and hedge fund bosses whose taxes David Cameron cut. 'Hardworking families are seeing their living standards squeezed, with prices rising faster than wages. Meanwhile David Cameron shows how out of touch he is, standing up for the millionaires who fund his party.' Meanwhile, the new figures show the Ministry of Sound gave £65,000 to the Lib Dems, just weeks before the nightclub's boss James Palumbo received a peerage from Nick Clegg. The superclub firm made a donation of £50,000 to the central party on June 6, and on June 30 a further £15,000 was given to the Bermondsey and Old Southwark local association of Lib Dem deputy leader Simon Hughes.","Five biggest unions responsible for 72% of  £3,136,447 given in April-June .

One of the teenage girls doused with battery acid on the island of Zanzibar was released from hospital last night. Kirstie Trup, 18, who was soaked with acid along with her friend Katie Gee, also 18, in the horrifying attack last week, will return to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital on Thursday to undergo skin grafts, her mother Rochelle has said. Miss Gee, who is said to have suffered burns to 80 per cent of her right arm and 50 per cent of her torso, remains in hospital where she is expected to undergo surgery. Apprehension: Kirstie Trup, left, and Katie Gee, today began a fourth day in Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after being flown home from Zanzibar . Care: The two teenagers were both taken to Chelsea and Westminster Hospital after returning to the UK from Zanzibar on Friday . Mrs Trup, 49, told the Evening Standard: 'I can confirm that Kirstie has been temporarily discharged until Thursday when she’s back in for a skin graft. We won’t make any comments regarding Katie.' Miss Gee's mother Nicky Gee declined to comment on her daughter's treatment at what she described as a 'very sensitive time'. The hospital refused to comment on the girls' condition today. The Telegraph reports that Miss Trup managed to limit the extent of her injuries by running into the sea. Her father Marc Trup told the paper that the salt water and the acid 'completely altered the result'. He added: 'The other girl panicked, ran around and made her way to a public toilet.' Temporary discharge: Miss Trup returned to her family home in Hampstead, North London, last night after being released from hospital ahead of skin graft procedures on Thursday . Members of . both girls' families had been keeping a bedside vigil at the hospital, . where the victims' condition had been described as 'stable'. Police in Africa have arrested two suspects and questioned six others they believe have 'important information'. Extremist preacher Sheikh Issa Ponda Issa is understood to be under armed guard in hospital after he was injured while trying to evade police. He is said to have been shot in the shoulder as he tried to flee in Morogoro, 200 miles from Dar es Salaam. 'Beyond imagination': The teenage girls were covered by sheets as they were escorted out of an ambulance and into the hospital on Friday . Treatment: Consultant plastic surgeon Andy Williams, left, is part of the team treating the girls for their injuries, a glimpse of which can be seen in this photograph, right, released by Kirstie Trup's family . The Daily Telegraph said Sheikh Issa . Ponda Issa handed himself in to police a day after he was injured following the attack on the volunteer teachers. Held: Islamist cleric Sheikh Issa Ponda Issa is understood to be under armed guard in hospital . He is understood to have links to Uamsho, a radical Islamist group police suspect may have been involved in the attack. Acid attacks have become the hallmark of the group which wants Zanzibar’s independence from Tanzania and Sharia law to be imposed on the island. The cleric visited Zanzibar in the weeks leading up to the attack on the British girls and was seen encouraging his supporters to protest against ‘colonisation’ from Christians and inciting Muslim youths to violence. Miss Trup and Miss Gee were flown home from Africa in an emergency air ambulance and immediately sent to the capital's regional burns centre on Friday. Asked whether the victims of such an attack as they suffered would be likely to require surgery, plastic surgeon Dr Mohammad Jawad told MailOnline: 'Most certainly.' Dr Jawad, who helped to rebuild model and television presenter Katie Piper's face after she was wounded by an acid attack, said full assessment were likely to be carried out under general anaesthetic to establish the depths of the burns suffered. The surgeon said treatment plans would be discussed with each patient and that they would undergo skin grafts. 'The aim is to get the area healed in a normal way and reconstruct what is lost, and of course we are all looking for aesthetically pleasing outcomes.' Dr Jawad said further treatment could take place in the future following initial procedures, and added that the victims would need 'plenty of psychological support and good scar management'. One friend of the pair told how one of the two men involved in the unprovoked attack 'smiled' before throwing acid. Speaking . from Zanzibar, medical student Olivia Moore told Channel 4 News: 'The . two men were on a moped and they went past a group of tourists. 'They . stopped for the girls and the two men then looked at each other, . nodded, and then the man on the back of the bike smiled and threw acid . on the girls. 'From then on it's just chaotic. There was no incident that preceded the actual attack. 'Everyone was shocked. Nobody can think of a motivation or anything that precipitated this.' Attack: Two men on a moped hurled acid in the girls' faces as they walked to meet friends for dinner in Stone Town, Zanzibar (seen in a file photo) Miss Gee has already taken to Twitter to thank well-wishers for their support, while a photograph released by the teenagers' families showed the injuries one of them suffered in the attack. The young women were enjoying the last week of a trip as volunteer teachers to the predominantly Muslim island when the corrosive substance was thrown at them in an apparently unprovoked attack. They had originally planned to return in time to collect their A-level results this week, with Miss Trup hoping to study history at the University of Bristol while Miss Gee is considering the University of Leeds, it was reported.","Kirstie Trup and Katie Gee, both 18, doused with acid on Zanzibar .

Detectives investigating illegal payments to police officers for inside information are demanding that a private detective agency hand over its list of paid confidential sources. The list is held offshore and belongs to RISC Management, a London-based agency under investigation for allegedly bribing Metropolitan Police officers on behalf of wealthy clients. It is believed the list may contain the identity of scores of corrupt officers and Government officials. Probe: Metropolitan Police officers are demanding to see the list containing the identity of corrupt officers and Government officials . Evidence of a confidential source . payment system was discovered among computer files and documents . recently seized from RISC’s office by the Met’s anti-corruption squad. One invoice suggests that Risk Solutions, a management company in . Gibraltar, is paid to keep the list of confidential sources secure. The discovery is a significant breakthrough  in the Met’s year-long corruption probe. When . The Mail on Sunday learned about the list two weeks ago, detectives . urged us to delay publication of the report while it carried out an . operation last week. The Met refuses to say what steps it took, but a . spokesman confirmed last night that detectives would force disclosure of . the list through the courts unless RISC handed it over voluntarily. The Mail on Sunday has spoken to former RISC insiders who described how the ‘source payment system’ worked. Cash . from a well-known bureau de change is couriered to RISC’s office and . passed to a small group of senior executives who run and pay . confidential sources. Each . source has a codename, for example T43, but only a few RISC executives . know their real identity, which is recorded on the list. The . system was set up six years ago. It followed concerns expressed in an . internal memo seen by this newspaper that RISC needed a way of dealing . with the ‘time bomb’ of large cash payments to unidentified sources in . the event of an official investigation into its affairs. 'Plot': The Mail on Sunday report in June that named RISC management for allegedly bribing Metropolitan Police officers . Anti-corruption detectives are examining allegations that two RISC executives bribed officers on an anti-money-laundering unit (SCD6) for information about the case they were building against their Nigerian client, James Ibori, a former state governor, and his British solicitor Bhadresh Gohil. RISC invoices were sent anonymously to the Met and police watchdog last year. The invoices purportedly detailed £20,000 of payments between 2007 and 2008 to the SCD6 detectives and other ‘confidential sources’ associated with the Ibori prosecution. In May, RISC chief executive Keith Hunter and former managing director Cliff Knuckey were arrested on suspicion of bribing SCD6 detective constable John MacDonald. James Ibori, a former state governor had a case built against him . Hunter and Knuckey are former Met detectives. Knuckey trained MacDonald in anti-money- laundering techniques before he left the force in 2003. MacDonald was also arrested and placed on restricted duties. All three men deny the allegations. The Crown Prosecution Service has since . advised there should be no further action concerning DC MacDonald and he . has returned to full duties. RISC maintains that Gohil fabricated the invoices to assist an appeal against the seven-year sentence he received in 2011 for money-laundering. Ibori pleaded guilty earlier this year and was jailed for 13 years. However, The Mail on Sunday has learned of another significant discovery among RISC’s seized files that suggests the invoices are genuine. It is an internal RISC email dated August 5, 2008, and titled ‘0382/C – Invoice Breakdown’. Attached to the email is a two-page invoice detailing RISC’s work on the Ibori case (Project 0383/C) from March to May 2008. One entry on April 8 reads: ‘Engaged with source in eliciting information re: forthcoming interviewing strategy to de [sic] deployed by Police.’ The next line records a £5,000 ‘Cash payment made to above source for information provided’. The invoice is almost identical, including spelling mistakes, to those sent anonymously to the Met more than three years later. Detectives believe the invoices they received in 2011 are authentic but are a later version, with details of RISC’s work on the Ibori and Gohil case included. Knuckey maintains that Gohil fabricated the RISC invoices and denies making any corrupt payments. He agrees that he recommended the offshore source payment system to Hunter but said none of his own confidential sources was registered this way. It is understood that Knuckey left RISC in 2009 after falling out with Hunter over a client invoice. In a statement, RISC said: ‘RISC’s business relationship with Risk Solutions had no connection or role in respect of the James Ibori / Bhadresh Gohil case whatsoever. The business relationship related to historic and wholly unrelated clients of RISC, the details of which remain absolutely confidential to those clients. ‘Risk Solutions has never made any source payments for or on behalf of RISC for any purpose, in the same way that RISC has never made any unlawful payments to serving police officers.’",'Scores' of corrupt officers and Government officials may be named .

A town judge on Tuesday refused to dismiss a drugged-driving case against Kerry Kennedy, ex-wife of Gov. Andrew Cuomo, clearing the way for a fall trial. Kennedy ‘cut a wide swath of danger and risk’ when she was arrested in July after her Lexus swerved into a tractor-trailer near her home north of New York City, Justice Elyse Lazansky wrote in a ruling filed in North Castle Town Court. The judge acknowledged Kennedy's public service but said a trial did not have to end that. Request denied: A town judge refused to dismiss a drugged-driving case against Kerry Kennedy (pictured) stemming from a July collision involving her Lexus and a tractor-trailer . ‘It is safe to say that Kerry Kennedy is not a typical criminal defendant. She has achieved a great deal and is dedicated to good works ... other gifted powerful and wealthy politicians and celebrities too numerous to mention have faced a wide variety of criminal charges and have gone on to do their jobs or serve the public in many important ways,’ Lazansky said. No trial date was set, but a trial would be in October at the earliest. Kennedy, dressed in a blue dress spangled with small white flowers, appeared dour as she stood outside the courthouse after the hearing flanked by her lawyer and one of her three daughters, as well as her sister-in-law, Molly Kennedy. When asked how Kennedy felt about the decision, defense attorney Gerald Lefcourt said Kennedy was ‘not happy about it, but it is what it is.’ ‘We are very disappointed and we disagree with it, but we have every confidence that Ms. Kennedy will be exonerated,’ Lefcourt said. Drugged driving: Kerry Kennedy was charged with driving under the influence in July and now says she accidentally took sleeping medication . Police said the daughter of the late . Sen. Robert F. Kennedy failed sobriety tests. A small amount of a . sleeping drug was found in her blood. She said she believed she . accidentally took a sleeping pill that morning instead of thyroid . medication. Prosecutors had argued that dropping the charge would feed the perception that famous people are treated differently. Kennedy . and her lawyers had argued in court papers that fairness demanded a . dismissal. They said she took the sleeping pill accidentally and the . only harm done was to Kennedy's own pride and her famous name. They recounted her work for social justice and included a large file of glowing letters from friends and relatives. Kennedy's . mother, Ethel Kennedy, wrote that ‘Human rights defenders in need from . the tomato fields of Florida to the slums of Port au Prince, the desert . of Western Sahara and the still homeless of New Orleans have come to . rely on her compassion, keen insight, judgment and support.’ Other letters came from her brothers, sisters and in-laws, several priests and an assistant secretary of state. Lefcourt . noted that the assassinations of Kennedy's father and uncle, President . John F. Kennedy, meant Kennedy ‘experienced more tragedy by the age of 8 . years old than most people experience in a lifetime.’ Pill mix-up: The daughter of assassinated senator RFK says she meant to take her daily thyroid medication that morning last July . He . wrote that Kennedy's accident caused no injuries or damage to other . vehicles, and ‘any harm is limited to the humiliation and embarrassment . inflicted on Ms. Kennedy, and the damage to her reputation because of . her community standing and family name.’ Justice Elyse Lazansky said in her ruling that going to trial will not prevent Kerry Kennedy from carrying on with her humanitarian work . However, . the Westchester County District Attorney's Office opposed a dismissal, . saying that ‘would feed a public perception that people of wealth and . privilege are treated differently than others.’ The . defense said that position held Kennedy to a higher standard ‘because . of her family name and purported wealth and notoriety.’ Kennedy is due back in court October 8 for a pre-trial appearance. The judge has yet to set a trial date. In court documents filed in March, . Kennedy argued that she inadvertently took the drug zolpidem, a form of . Ambien, instead of her daily thyroid medication, prior to the July 13 . incident. The filing claims the two bottles 'are virtually identical in size, shape and appearance.' Kennedy, . who was once married to New York governor Andrew Cuomo, crashed her . Lexus into a tractor-trailer in North Castle, New York, at around 8am as . she was heading to the gym. Police say the 53-year-old mother of three then fled the scene and was found at an exit ramp. Close call: There were no injuries on I-684 (pictured) after Kennedy reportedly hit a tractor trailer, fled, and was found nearby by cops . Kennedy failed a sobriety test and . was allegedly slurring her words. A small amount of the sleep-inducing . drug was found in Kennedy’s blood. The driver of the vehicle that was . struck by Kennedy's Lexus, 47-year-old Rocco Scuiletti, pleaded guilty . last November to a count of disobeying a traffic device and was later . fired from his job, Chappaqua-Mount Kisco Patch reported. Letters . of support from famous family members and friends, including her mother . Ethel Kennedy, were all part of the 99-page motion. “I . have too much regard for the lives of others, as well as my own, to . place them at risk by driving under the influence of zolpidem,’ Kennedy . wrote in an affidavit. Humanitarian: Kennedy, pictured here at a May 13 rally in support of New York farm workers, and her lawyers recounted her work for social justice in court filings . Equality before the law: Prosecutors opposed a dismissal of Kennedy's case, saying that would feed a public perception that people of wealth and privilege are treated differently than others . The Kennedy family has been prominent in the news in New York's northern suburbs over the past year. Kerry Kennedy's sister-in-law and close friend, Mary Kennedy, hanged herself a year ago at her Bedford home.

Cameron Cleland, 16, searched the internet for ways to kill his victim before deciding to ‘gut her like a pig’. The solicitor’s son even practised his attack in front of a mirror at his parents’ £1million home. He lured the girl to a secluded location by threatening to kill himself if she would not meet him, a court heard. Cleland told her to ‘be quiet and submit to death’ before launching a ferocious assault. Her life was saved because a dog walker interrupted the attack. The schoolboy admitted attempted murder and was jailed for life at Bradford Crown Court, with a minimum term of seven years before he can be considered for parole. The defendant had been predicted to get A* grades in his GCSEs at a leading independent school. The court heard he came from a ‘highly respected family’ and his parents were in court to hear Judge Durham Hall, QC, describe their son’s ‘chilling’ response to rejection. The judge said he carried out the attack without any ‘hesitation, pause, provocation or warning’. ‘You threatened her with rape and then tried to heighten an ordeal already beyond contemplation to a normal person – you told her to be quiet and submit to death,’ said the judge. ‘This cannot be passed off as a young man coping with sexual rejection and you have since expressed your regret that you did not kill her. Your victim was distraught, confused and bewildered and the trauma you have caused her is incalculable.’ The judge ordered that Cleland should lose his right to anonymity as a juvenile. The schoolboy told psychiatrists he would have been prepared to go to prison for the rest of his life if he had succeeded in killing her. Michael Smith, prosecuting, said Cleland was a highly intelligent and ‘slightly geeky’ teenager who had been infatuated with the girl for some time, although she did not share his feelings. Terror: Bradford Crown Court heard how Cleland had practised in front of the mirror before carrying out his attack . Last October he contacted Childline to admit he liked an 11-year-old girl and found it a ‘bit weird’. He later said he wanted to rape her. 'Chilling': Judge Jonathan Durham Hall sentenced Cleland to life with a minimum of seven years at Bradford Crown Court . The teenager would stare at the girl on trains and filmed her on his mobile phone. A month before the attack he threatened suicide if she would not meet him and there were 130 texts between them. Eventually he persuaded her to meet him at a secluded spot in Ben Rhydding, near Ilkley in West Yorkshire in April. Mr Smith said the girl ‘freaked out’ when she saw him walking towards her with his hoodie up. Cleland, who was wearing surgical gloves, asked her to go down a drive to talk and when she refused he knocked her to the ground and went for her neck with a penknife. The knife was blunt and caused only scratches so he tried to strangle her. The girl managed to break free, but he knocked her to the ground again and continued his attack. He was disturbed by dog walker Angela Heap, who found him astride the girl with his hands around her throat. Mr Smith said the girl remembers a woman telling her to run home. The victim suffered wounds to her chest and hands, cuts and grazes to her back and body, bruising to her eyes and neck marks consistent with strangulation. When Cleland was arrested he was carrying a knife with the girl’s blood on it. A psychologist and psychiatrist concluded he was not mentally ill but could be in the early stages of a psychopathic condition.","Cameron Cleland made 'chilling' murder plan when younger girl rejected him .

Graham Winston-Peters and Ivy Pink may not be household names, but they have appeared on more TV shows than most celebrities. They are so obsessed that they have notched up more than 50 ‘reality’ appearances in the past ten years – and that’s not counting their work as extras and in music videos. Scroll down for video compilation . 'We're not shy': Graham Winston-Peters and his wife Ivy Pink, seen discussing their nudist wedding on the This Morning sofa, have racked up scores of TV appearances . The couple, from Leatherhead, Surrey, . got married in the nude on television for the show Four Weddings and . discussed their sex lives in front of the nation on This Morning. Miss Pink said she would even have given birth live if anyone would have had her. They got their taste for television . in 2003 when Mr Winston-Peters went on ITV’s Bootsale Challenge and have . subsequently won four competitions and taken home prize money from a . variety of game shows. On camera: Graham proposed to Ivy while they were in the audience on the TV show All Star Mr & Mrs . Getting hitched: Graham and Ivy embrace in front of the cameras after getting engaged while in a live studio audience . ‘I auditioned for the first show on a . whim and really enjoyed it,’ said Mr Winston-Peters, 47. ‘I won the . second show I went on, then I wanted to do more and more. ‘We’re very quick-witted and extravagant, we say exactly what we feel and nothing fazes us so TV shows love us.’ The couple met in Amsterdam at the . Van Gogh museum and after a whirlwind romance the venue for Mr . Winston-Peters’ proposal was, of course, a television studio, although . this time they were in the audience on All Star Mr & Mrs. Miss Pink . said the wedding was ‘incredible’. ‘We got married on Four Weddings.

In total the limelight-loving pair have notched up more than 100 appearances on television and film - and they're not satisfied yet. Mr Winston-Peters wants to branch out beyond reality shows and forge a full-time acting career. 'It’s my . ambition to get into acting full time, but I love reality shows too,' he said. 'I’m . just myself in front of the camera. 'I . think we have proved now that we’re not just in it for the attention, . if I was I would have made a mark and then gone.

Two of the women accused of covering up a damning internal report into a failed hospital inspection insisted last night that they never wanted their names to be kept secret. Jill Finney, former deputy chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, and Anna Jefferson, the watchdog’s media manager, both insisted they wanted the truth to come out, despite allegations that they wanted heavy criticism of the CQC to be withheld from the public. In the explosive report about the cover-up published this week, the two women were initially referred to as ‘Mr G’ and ‘Mr F’ after lawyers warned that naming them could breach the Data Protection Act or lead to libel lawsuits. Protected: Anna Jefferson, the media manager of the Care Quality Commission, was not initially named in a damning report into a failed hospital inspection . This led to further accusations of a cover-up and political pressure forced the CQC to reveal their identities, along with those of then CQC Chief Executive Cynthia Bower. But now Miss Finney, who lost her new job at internet firm Nominet in the wake of the row, and Miss Jefferson, who is on maternity leave, have condemned the botched attempt to anonymise the report as it made the story far bigger. Miss Finney, former Deputy Chief Executive at the CQC, said: ‘It was very clear that the redaction was worthless. I feel that the CQC threw a scrap of information to the media and ensured there would be an extended feeding frenzy. ‘I believe the Grant Thornton report should not have been published in the way it was this week.’ Miss Jefferson, due to return to the CQC as Media Manager next month, said: ‘I thought it was a very poor decision to anonymise it in the first place.’ Under fire: Cynthia Bower, chief executive of the Care Quality Commission, was 'round the table' when the decision was taken to delete evidence of a botched CQC inspection . Asked if she felt like a scapegoat, she replied: ‘I certainly feel extremely vulnerable and I’m astonished that this has happened. That I could be on maternity leave and exposed to this, with absolutely no evidence at all. It’s like living in a nightmare. ‘I did absolutely nothing wrong and I’ve got evidence that I actually pushed for more scrutiny.’ The CQC had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ‘Serious Untoward Incidents’ including child deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria. But it only launched a full investigation into the Morecambe Bay trust that runs the hospital in December 2011. Consultants Deloitte said in a previously unreported review that ‘there may have been an earlier missed opportunity’ to intervene. Astonishingly the CQC had no ‘written record’ of why it decided to investigate Morecambe Bay, where some 38 babies were delivered stillborn between 2002 and 2009, 15 more died in the first two weeks of birth and three mothers had died while pregnant or within a year of giving birth. The watchdog carried out an internal review of its earlier inspections, but it was never published. Baby deaths: Joshua Titcombe being held by his sister Emily at Furness Hospital in Barrow. He died of an infection which could have been cured with antibiotics . The latest high-profile account published by consultants Grant Thornton this week found that senior figures at the CQC agreed to suppress the account of their failings in monitoring University Hospitals Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust. But speaking separately to the Mail on Sunday, Miss Finney and Miss Jefferson strongly rejected the claims against them. They say that rather than containing devastating revelations about the health watchdog’s failures, the internal review actually blamed hospital managers. Miss Jefferson said it was a ‘whitewash’ rather than a ‘smoking gun’. Miss Finney said: ‘I, and others, made it clear to Grant Thornton that we thought the document let CQC off the hook and we thought it could have been far tougher.’ The pair, interviewed separately by the Mail on Sunday, deny there was any order to delete the review and stop it being published under Freedom of Information laws. Poor care: The CQC had known as far back as 2009 that there had been 12 ¿Serious Untoward Incidents¿ including child deaths at Furness General Hospital in Cumbria . Miss Jefferson said she had actually called for a better, external review of the Morecambe Bay case last July and kept minutes of a meeting with new CQC Chief Executive David Behan where she ‘pushed very hard’ for this. Miss Finney said: ‘There was no instruction to delete, but there was a need to do further work.’Employment lawyers are now looking into what action can be taken against the CQC officials, which could include stripping former Chief Executive Miss Bower and her deputy Miss Finney of their multi-million pound pensions. Miss Jefferson is due to return from maternity leave next month but it is unclear if she will be able to return to her old job. The Metropolitan Police have been asked by an MP to look into the alleged cover-up at the CQC while Cumbria Police are still looking into the death of one baby in the care of the trust, Joshua Titcombe.","Care Quality Commission hid Jill Finney and Anna Jefferson's identities .

"By . Steve Robson . PUBLISHED: . 21:44 EST, 24 June 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 02:57 EST, 15 August 2013 . Response: The former head of the CQC Cynthia Bower has denied being part of a cover-up by senior managers . The former head of the CQC has denied allegations that her management team ordered a cover up at a health trust where 16 babies and two mothers are suspected of dying through neglect saying, 'I feel I've been hung out to dry'. Cynthia Bower, the former head of the NHS regulator, denies having backed an order by her then deputy Jill Finney, to delete a report which said they failed to investigate a health trust properly, back in 2011. Police are considering whether to launch a formal investigation into the alleged cover-up by executives at the Care Quality Commission. In an interview with The Independent, Ms Bower said she would welcome a police probe. The 57-year-old, who resigned in February last year with a pension pot of £1.35m, said it would be a 'fairer and more reasonable process' than the report published by consultants Grant Thornton. Up to 16 babies and two mothers are . feared to have died between 2001 and 2012 due to poor care at the . maternity unit at Barrow-in-Furness general hospital, part of the . University Hospitals of Morecambe Bay foundation trust. Another nine infants were born with permanent brain damage. The review found that despite multiple warnings about Morecambe Bay hospitals, a CQC inspection gave the trust the all-clear in 2010. Even . when a CQC official produced a dossier showing the inspection was . flawed, bosses told him to destroy it to protect the commission’s . reputation. In the accounts . of a discussion between Ms Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and media manager Anna Jefferson about what to do with the findings, Ms Jefferson is alleged to have said: 'Are you kidding me? This can never be in the . public domain nor subject to a freedom of information request – read my . lips.' Jill Finney yesterday strenuously denied she had ordered the internal report to be deleted. She told the BBC they had not wanted it published because it was ‘not thorough enough’. Ms Bower, who earned £200,000-a-year in her former role, told newspaper that she 'categorically denies' that an order to delete the report was made or that such words were used. Quality of care: Up to 14 babies and two mothers may have died due to poor care since 2001, but the CQC gave the Barrow-in-Furness hospital a clean bill of health in 2010 . The report was not deleted, but the . Morecambe Bay trust was registered as 'compliant' in April 2011 and was . given foundation status, despite concerns about the deaths of mothers . and babies. Asked . what action that CQC had taken in response to the original internal . review, Ms Bower said: 'Many changes were already in place. We had to . learn on the job. At that point we were looking at changes in our . methods.' Ms Bower's name . was initially kept out of the damning assessment made by Grant Thornton. But the Government overturned legal advice not to name individuals . because of data protection laws. New CQC chief executive David Behan said . there was still a 'risk' that the organisation could be sued under data . protection laws but he believed publishing the information was in the . public interest. Denial: Media manager Anna Jefferson denies she ordered the critical report to be deleted . Ms Bower said she has been 'on the run' ever since her name was released into the public domain and confirmed she is 'taking legal advice'. Ms Jefferson . issued a statement last week insisting: 'I would never have conspired to . cover up anything which could have led to a better understanding of what . went wrong in the regulation of this hospital and I am devastated that I . have been implicated in this way. 'This quote is . completely untrue. I cannot imagine why my manager would have put these words . in my mouth - and in fact she has since said she did not attribute this quote . to me. 'On the basis that the quote is false, . uncorroborated and has since been retracted, I am appalled that it appears in . the report. 'The thought of what the families who have lost . babies at this hospital have gone through is heartbreaking.' The toxic order telling a CQC official to suppress his critical internal review was issued at a meeting on March 12 last year at the regulator’s London office. Present with the official – named only as Mr J – in the Finsbury Tower building were chief executive Cynthia Bower, her deputy Jill Finney and a third senior official, whose identity is not known. In the redacted report, commissioned by the CQC from consultants Grant Thornton, the three officials are identified as Mr E, Mr F and Mr G. Grant Thornton does not say which letter relates to which individual, although it has confirmed that genders have been changed. Mr J said Mr G ‘gave him an instruction to delete his report and that Mr E supported him in this, as did Mr F’. The report continues: ‘According to Mr J, the reason for Mr G giving this instruction was that the report was damaging for the CQC and posed an “FOI” [freedom of information] risk. ‘Mr J claimed that Mr G said to him “Read my lips” when he gave him the instruction.’ Mr J produced a handwritten contemporaneous note of the meeting to support his allegations. When Grant Thornton spoke to Mr G he was ‘somewhat equivocal’ about what had occurred. At an initial interview he said ‘he was not sure’ whether there had been an instruction to destroy the report. Questioned a second time, he claimed he could not remember as far back as March 2012. When asked if he had instructed Mr J to delete the report , Mr G replied that he did not as ‘he would not have been authorised to do so’, which, says Grant Thornton, ‘was somewhat ambiguous, although preceded by a denial’. Grant Thornton concluded that when given the chance to explain himself at two interviews Mr G ‘did not unequivocally deny’ giving the instruction. Mr F was also ‘somewhat equivocal’. When asked if he recalled anyone giving an instruction to delete Mr J’s report his first answer was that he did not. When asked a second time, he replied that he could not say whether the instruction was given but if it had been he could not think why he had not acted upon it, ‘which is not a denial that the instruction was given’. Mr E’s answer was much more clear-cut. ‘He “had no recollection of the meeting but said that an instruction of that sort” would have stuck in his mind.’ None of the three produced notes of the meeting. The report concluded: ‘Of the four accounts we were given during the course of the of our enquiries, we find Mr J’s version the most reliable.’","Cynthia Bower denies being part of alleged order to delete critical report .

Power shift: German chancellor Angela Merkel raised the prospect of curbing Brussels' influence . Angela Merkel will back David Cameron’s call for the repatriation of powers from  Brussels to Westminster. The German Chancellor yesterday announced she wants to encourage talks on whether the European Union should ‘give something back’ to member states this autumn. In a major boost for the Prime Minister, Mrs Merkel said: ‘We don’t have to do everything in Brussels.’ She signalled that she wants negotiations to begin after next month’s German general election. Mr Cameron has said he will renegotiate the UK’s relationship with Brussels before holding an in-out referendum in 2017. The Mail can reveal that Mrs Merkel has privately signalled to Tory Eurosceptics that she wants to do a deal to help Mr Cameron to help him get what he wants so that Britain stays in the EU. Senior sources say she has assured Mr Cameron of her support as long as he does not force her to ‘choose between Britain and Europe’. Mrs Merkel has opened a secret back channel to Tory MPs who are working with the Foreign Office to draw up a list of demands for the renegotiation. She sent an envoy from her Christian Democrat party to talk to members of the 100-strong Fresh Start group of MPs – and he promised to support the UK as long as their proposals do not involve changing EU treaties. Fresh Start, which includes influential backbenchers Andrea Leadsom, Dominic Raab and George Eustice, has visited Berlin and is planning further trips to European capitals to pave the way for renegotiation. A senior member said: ‘Angela Merkel . sent an envoy from her party to speak to Fresh Start. We were given the . explicit message that she had seen what we were proposing and could . support it.’ Uphill struggle: David Cameron, pictured on a visit to Glasgow, wants to claw back powers from Brussels before holding an in-out referendum . A source in Berlin said while they . were not in favour of ‘re-opening existing treaties’ they were in favour . of handing back power from Brussels to national and regional . government. In an interview yesterday Mrs Merkel . made clear that EU regulation has gone too far and that small numbers of . member states ought to be able to do deals together, without the need . for the whole EU to sign up. On German TV, she said: ‘I believe . that in Europe at the moment we have to take care to coordinate our . competiveness more closely. (But) we don’t have to do everything in . Brussels. ‘We can also consider whether we can give something back.’ Mrs Leadsom said: ‘It’s no surprise . that Andrea Merkel backs repatriation. The Fresh Start trip to Berlin, . and meetings with German officials in London made clear that they see . keeping Britain in the EU as a top priority. ‘They also see EU competitiveness as vital and recognise that  it has made itself too cumbersome.’ Among the ideas being  proposed by Fresh Start is an emergency brake on . future EU legislation that affects the City and a scaling back of the . EU’s powers over employment and social legislation. Sources suggest Britain could secure a . partial or complete opt-out from the Working Time Directive as the . price for supporting further harmonisation of the Eurozone economies.","Angela Merkel says it is time for the EU to 'give something back'

THE eurozone yesterday came out of its longest recession since the single currency was launched in 1999 – but economists warned that the crisis is far from over. The continent is still so blighted by rampant youth unemployment and staggering levels of government debt that even the Brussels commissioner responsible for the 17-nation bloc warned against premature celebrations. Economists did welcome the signs of recovery in the eurozone, which has been mired in a slump for 18 months, but said there is a long way to go before the 300 million-plus citizens of the single currency area can expect an end to their misery. On the up: The combined economies of the 17 eurozone countries grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of 2013 . Figures released yesterday show the . eurozone’s economy grew by 0.3 per cent in the second quarter of this . year compared with the first three months, finally ending the recession . that first hit the single currency area in the final three months of . 2011. The crisis afflicting the region has . thrown millions onto the dole queues and provoked a wave of violent . protests on the streets as governments have tried to revive their . economies and reduce their excessive borrowing through draconian . austerity measures. It threatens to create a ‘lost . generation’ of young people unable to find jobs. The youth unemployment . rate is nearly 24 per cent for the euro area overall, and a crippling . 58.7 per cent in Greece and 56.1 per cent in Spain. Official figures also revealed that . while stronger nations are returning to growth, weaker countries are . still struggling. Germany, the region’s industrial powerhouse, grew by . 0.7 per cent in the second quarter and the French economy managed growth . of 0.5 per cent, both better results than experts had predicted. Jobs: There are 300,000 more people in work since the same time in 2012, and two thirds of the jobs have gone to Brits . But Spain and Italy were still in . recession, and comparative figures for troubled Greece are not yet . available. The growth rate of minus 4.6 per cent in Greece is compared . with last year rather than the first three months of this. Europe’s economic monetary affairs . commissioner Olli Rehn said the figures suggested the European economy . was gradually gaining momentum, but added that there was no room for . complacency. ‘There are still substantial obstacles to overcome: the . growth figures remain low and the tentative signs of growth are still . fragile,’ he said. Despite the improved growth figures, . weaker eurozone nations are still beset by problems including high . unemployment, particularly among the young, enormous public debt . burdens, crippled banking systems and poor competitiveness. Commentators say the eurozone as a whole is also held back by rigid labour market laws. The overall eurozone growth rate of 0.3 per cent in the second quarter . compares with 0.6 per cent in the UK, 0.4 per cent in the US and 0.6 per . cent in Japan, according to the EU statistics agency Eurostat. Howard Archer, economist with . independent forecaster IHS Global Insight, said: ‘There is an underlying . impetus towards recovery but the eurozone is not out of the woods yet. Maybe it is a little bit nearer the edge of the woods.’ The consulting firm Fathom commented: . ‘Although these figures are welcome, doubts about the sustainability of . this recovery persist. These figures do not signal the all-clear for . the euro crisis.’ Members of the zone were hit by three major problems. First, by taking . advantage of interest rates set at low levels to suit the prudent . Germans, poorer countries were able to rack up huge debts, which they . then struggled to repay. Second, when the 2008 financial . crisis hit, they had no control over either interest rates or their own . currency. Third, in return for bailouts, countries such as Greece and . Ireland had to sign up to tough austerity policies. Andrew Smith, chief economist at . accountant KPMG, said: ‘Recovery has to start somewhere, but the . periphery countries are still in a lot of trouble.’","17 countries using single currency grows by 0.3%, more than expected .

Sarah Msika, who left a pensioner lying on the floor with a broken leg two days before he died, said the man and his wife had refused her help . An agency nurse who left a pensioner lying on the floor with a broken leg two days before he died claimed the man and his wife had refused her help. Sarah Msika admitted leaving the couple on the floor when she visited them, the Nursing and Midwifery Council heard. She has now been cleared of a number of other charges including allegations she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean one of the patients. An ambulance crew found Patient A, 79, on the kitchen floor covered in her own faeces propped up against a kitchen table. Medics then discovered her husband, Patient B, lying on his back with a broken leg in the lounge at their home on the outskirts of Norwich, Norfolk. He died of a blood clot to the lung two days later while his wife passed away six months later. Giving evidence, Msika insisted the couple had told her they were 'okay' when she visited them on August 4, 2011. She said: 'If a patient is quite dismissive of help or you are asking them and they are saying they are okay, I am not sure - I wasn't quite sure - of the steps to take.' David Clark, for the NMC, asked why the nurse had not informed colleagues about Patient B, who was lying on his back. Msika, who worked as an Agency Nurse for Mayday Healthcare Plc, said: 'I did, I know I did. I said I have got two patients or I left two patients on the floor that need assistance. 'I did tell them that there were two patients that needed assistance.' Mr Clark asked, 'Why did you not call the emergency services?' Msika said: 'I have been asked that question so many times. I have asked myself the question so many times. 'I did not at the time think I needed to call an ambulance. The concern that I had was they were on the floor. 'Patient B didn't look distressed or anything and was actually refusing any help. 'I knew nothing about Patient B. He was not my patient, I did not have any background information about him. I had no idea why he was on the floor. 'I think it is quite evident that they were a couple who were quite reluctant to receive any help.' Msika described the situation as 'challenging' but said she had never intended 'to cause harm to anyone'. The nurse referred to the NMC code of conduct, which 'states that I should respect and support people's rights to accept or decline care'. The Nursing and Midwifery Council (pictured) cleared Msika of allegations she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean one of the patients . A 'relatively brief' police investigation was mounted into the incident, but Msika faced no criminal charges, the hearing was told. Msika admitted leaving Patients A and B on the floor of their home, failing to call for emergency assistance and failing to carry out a proper assessment of Patient B. She also admitted failing to notice that Patient B had fractured his leg and failing to escalate the situation. 'I think it is quite evident that they were a couple who were quite reluctant to receive any help' - Sarah Msika . Allegations that she failed to document her visit, did not tell another nurse about the situation and neglected to adequately clean Patient A were found not proved. In relation to the allegation that Msika left Patient A sitting in faeces, panel chairman Dr Andy Thomson said: 'The panel concluded that Mrs Msika would not have been expected to clean Patient A on her own. 'The panel finds that Mrs Msika did not adequately clean Patient A. 'However, as Mrs Msika would not have been expected to clean Patient A on her own, she should have sought assistance in a timelier manner in order to have Patient A cleaned. 'The panel considered that she failed to adequately escalate this matter or seek assistance to clean Patient A . 'Therefore, the panel found this charge not proved.' The allegation that Msika had not told other nurses about the situation was dismissed as it was based on 'mutiple hearsay evidence'. A charge that she failed to make appropriate records was dismissed due to 'insufficient evidence'. Msika now faces an anxious wait over her fate as the panel ran out of time before deciding whether she was guilty of misconduct. The hearing was adjourned until December 9.","Sarah Msika admitted leaving patients on the floor of their home in Norfolk .

The Bank of England spent nearly £25,000 on leaving gifts and parties to mark the retirement of former governor Mervyn King. Lord King finished his ten-year stewardship of the Bank last month, handing over to Canadian Mark Carney. He was showered with gifts worth £13,000 and treated to farewell events costing more than £10,000. Gift: Sir Mervyn King was given a copy of this portrait by Diana Blakeney as part of his farewell from the Bank of England . The most expensive gift was a £10,000 bespoke copy of his portrait, a traditional leaving present for governors, by artist Diana Blakeney. The original will hang at the Bank, alongside portraits of the men who have held the position since the first governor in 1694. He was also presented with a £597 silver napkin ring, a replica of those used in the directors’ dining room and another traditional parting gift. Lord King also took home a more personal gift, a bust of German literary giant and politician Johann von Goethe, worth £2,505. The Bank also laid on three events – an evening reception costing £4,672 and two dinners costing £3,450 and £3,800. Included in the events cost was £1,501 for flowers and invitations. It took the final bill to £24,922 – just below the national average wage of £26,000. The total, revealed in a Freedom of Information request, was paid by the Bank of England. Fond farewell: Sir Mervyn King left the Bank of England with a portrait of himself, a silver napkin ring and a bust of German politician Johann von Goethe . Largesse: Critics said the revelations reveal the apparent culture of extravagance at the Bank, which has preached the virtues of austerity . Successor: Canadian Mark Carney took over as governor in July . Lord King, 65, who earned a £300,000 salary, will enjoy a pension from the Bank believed to be worth more than £200,000 a year. The Bank, which is owned by the Treasury, is not directly funded by taxpayers, instead raising cash from a variety of sources including the financial sector. The main source is known as the ‘cash ratio deposit’, under which lenders deposit cash interest-free. The Bank then ploughs this into investments that pay interest, and keeps the difference for itself. But the Government’s 39 per cent stake in Lloyds and 81 per cent in Royal Bank of Scotland mean the governor’s gifts were technically funded in part by the State. Matthew Sinclair of the TaxPayers’ Alliance said: ‘These extravagant leaving gifts are in stark contrast to the situation faced by millions struggling with the cost of living thanks to stubborn levels of inflation overseen by Mervyn King. ‘Taxpayers and savers continue to pay for Bank of England policy so they will find it particularly egregious they are also paying so much for the governor’s goodbyes.’ Lord King’s predecessor Eddie George, who died in 2009, was given some furniture when he left, although a spokesman could not remember what it was.","Governor retires with presents and parties costing nearly £25,000 .

The ex-wife of Dragons' Den star Duncan Bannatyne has taken out a billboard-sized advert promoting her new gym - just over the road from his head office. Joanne McCue Bannatyne is also pictured on the eye-catching poster, which includes the slogan 'Welcome Your New Neighbours'. It is plainly visible from Bannatyne's office window in his HQ next to Bannatyne's Health Club in Darlington. Visible: Ms McCue Bannatyne's advert, pictured here on the left, can be seen clearly from her ex-husband's head office just over the road . Controversial: Ms McCue Bannatyne has now taken out this advert promoting her rival gym directly opposite her former husband's HQ . CrossFit: Ms McCue Bannatyne even appears on the advert with her team, pictured here in the centre in a red vest . Ms McCue Bannatyne, 47, whose divorce from the self-made millionaire was finalised earlier this year, opened her rival CrossFit gym in May at the former Darlington FC stadium, now home to Darlington Mowden Park Rugby Club. She declined to comment on whether the wording of the advert, which features a group shot of the CrossFit team, was designed to be provoke her former husband. However, she said: 'This was where we could get the advertising space in Darlington, it is one of the two main routes into the town and hoardings are quite hard to come by. 'Whether or not it's controversial, it picks up people driving into Darlington from Teesside.' The couple announced they were separating in 2011, five years after they were married. Bannatyne had proposed to the then Miss McCue during a holiday in Barbados. Fight-back: Ms McCue Bannatyne has opened a rival gym to her husbands. Right, the couple in happier times . Their break-up was particularly . acrimonious. After his wealth was valued at £430m in the Sunday . Times Rich List, Ms McCue Bannatyne reportedly demanded he pay her . £1,000 per day, plus payments for their two children, a house in the UK and holiday home in France. Bannatyne famously took to Twitter, where he now has more than 630,000 followers, and branded his then wife a 'gold digger'. But the divorce hit the former Royal Navy sailor hard, and in another tweet he threatened to . take his own life, saying: 'My day could not have been worse. Suicide is . a considered option.' The comments were later removed. Bannatyne operates more than 60 clubs across the country under the Bannatyne Health Club banner and has more than 180,000 members, according to its website. Last year the Sunday Times Rich List . estimated his wealth to be £85m, considerably less than the disputed . £430m, which Mr Bannatyne had claimed was one of the reasons for their . divorce. Rival: Ms McCue Bannatyne said the billboard is in a prime Darlington location, visible for motorists coming in and out of the town . In May this year it emerged Bannatyne was repaying debts of £122m - money he borrowed from Anglo Irish Bank to buy 24 fitness clubs from Hilton Group in 2006. The bank later collapsed and Bannatyne was forced to hire a team of legal and financial experts to negotiate the terms of his repayments with administrators KPMG. Earlier today a spokeswoman for the 64-year-old declined to comment on the latest twist. However, Bannatyne - who is starring in a new series of Dragons Den, which began on Sunday - spoke about the divorce from his former wife in a recent interview with the Daily Express. He said: 'Relations could not be worse. She's angry with me, but I still don't know why because she won't speak to me. 'I'm still in love with her, but she hates me.' It is not the first time a rival fitness business has utilised the advertising space directly outside Bannatyne's. When Lifestyle Fitness, in Eastmount Road, opened last year, it took out an advert on the same billboard.

"By . Ap . PUBLISHED: . 21:34 EST, 14 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 21:35 EST, 14 August 2013 . A South Carolina couple that wants to adopt a young Cherokee girl took their fight to Oklahoma on Wednesday, hoping to visit the child who previously lived with them for 27 months and seeking a compromise with her biological family that would return Veronica to their home. Matt and Melanie Capobianco believe they have done everything necessary to regain custody of the girl, who is about to turn 4. The U.S. Supreme Court said in June that provisions of the Indian Child Welfare Act, which would favor the girl's father, didn't apply in the case, and a South Carolina court awarded the couple custody on July 31. The ongoing dispute has raised questions about jurisdictions, tribal sovereignty and the federal law meant to help keep Native American tribes together. Compromise: Matt and Melanie Capobianco are willing to make a deal to get their adopted daughter back . 'We made the trip to Oklahoma to get our daughter,' Matt Capobianco said at a news conference in downtown Tulsa on Wednesday. 'Veronica will be coming home, but if there is going to be some thoughtful solution that continues to involve all who love her, then this is the time.' The girl, under a Cherokee Nation court order, has been with the family of Dusten Brown, her biological father. The tribe's chief urged patience. 'The Capobiancos have requested the Cherokee Nation and Dusten Brown to follow the South Carolina court's order, but they forget that Dusten Brown has the same rights to have his arguments heard before our Oklahoma courts and Cherokee Nation Tribal Court,' Chief Bill John Baker said. 'The Cherokee people throughout time have stood our ground and for the rights of our people, and this is no different. We will continue to stand by Dusten and his biological daughter, Veronica, and for what is right.' Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin urged the families to get together and talk - even threatening Brown with extradition to South Carolina on a charge of custodial interference if he was 'unwilling to cooperate.' In a statement distributed later Wednesday, Brown's lawyers said an Oklahoma court should determine what's best for the child. Dusten Brown, shows Brown with his daughter, Veronica, says he wasn't consulted when the girl's mother put her up for adoption . 'The South Carolina court's determination of this issue was based upon facts as they existed almost two years ago. We are fully in favor of a present day determination of Veronica's best interest to be made by a court in the state where Veronica has lived for the past 19 months,' lawyers Clark O. Brewster and Robert R. Nigh Jr. wrote. They said they would contact the Capobiancos lawyer to see if the families could reach a quick resolution. Veronica was born in late 2009. Brown initially did not press his parental rights - the girl's mother is not Native American - but when he discovered Veronica was going to be adopted, he objected and said the ICWA favored the girl living with him and growing up learning tribal traditions. The Capobiancos and their supporters said Wednesday a compromise is in order. 'We don't seek victory. What we seek is peace for our daughter,' Melanie Capobianco said. Troy Dunn, a family representative, said he was willing to meet with Brown to discuss arrangements. Only one side has been deemed the rightful parents,' Troy Dunn said at the family's news conference. 'Possession is not nine-tenths of the law.' Extradition: South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley is seeking Brown's extradition after he was charged with custodial interference . A handful of protesters shouted 'Keep Veronica home' and 'You're trying to break laws in Oklahoma' at the Capobiancos as they emerged from a hotel after meeting with reporters. Some held signs reading 'Keep Veronica Home' and others that were written in the Cherokee language. Under the Indian Child Welfare Act, the Cherokee Nation has a vested interest in the child and, if invoked at the right time, the law allows the tribe to take over the adoption proceedings. In June, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that South Carolina courts should decide who gets to adopt Veronica, rejecting earlier decisions in South Carolina that said the federal Indian Child Welfare Act favored her father. South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley has written to Oklahoma Gov. Mary Fallin seeking Brown's extradition after he was charged with custodial interference after missing a court hearing this month. Fallin initially said she would consider the warrant next month, after Brown's expected Oklahoma court appearance, but on Wednesday she tried to use the extradition papers as leverage in an effort to get the families talking. A first step would appear to be setting up a meeting between the Capobiancos and Veronica. 'Mr. and Mrs. Capobianco deserve an opportunity to meet with their adopted daughter. They also deserve the chance to meet with Mr. Brown and put an end to this conflict,' Fallin said. Pressure: Oklahoma Governor Mary Fallin is urging the two families to work it out, but threatened to extradite Brown . The Oklahoma governor urged a quick resolution and said, 'If Mr. Brown is unwilling to cooperate with these reasonable expectations, then I will be forced to expedite his extradition request and let the issue be settled in court.' Fallin did not set a deadline. The Capobiancos said they didn't know how long they planned to stay in Oklahoma. In Charleston, S.C., a family court judge on Wednesday listened to an argument from Brown's attorney asking him to reconsider aspects of the order requiring his client to turn over the child to the Capobiancos. Attorney John Nichols credited Fallin on her call for the meeting between the two sides, saying neither Brown nor the Capobiancos will be happy if the case lands in court. 'That's all we have requested from day one in this case, that the courts engage in reflection and deliberation before they act,' Nichols said after the two-hour hearing. Dunn said he would meet with Brown anywhere, anytime to develop a plan to raise the child. 'There is but one solution which takes Veronica's short-term and long-term needs into account: compromise,' Dunn said.","The U.S. Supreme Court said in June that .

Parents who had a baby in 2012 can expect to shell out $241,080 by the time the kid reaches 18 years old, a number that has been going steadily up for years as average wages have gone down. A U.S. Department of Agriculture report released Wednesday looked at food, shelter, and other necessities, which rose 3 percent from 2011 numbers. The biggest expense increases were seen in costs related to child care, education, health care, and clothing. College tuition, however, was not included in those totals. Scroll down for video... Children, by the numbers: The USDA annually estimates the costs of raising a child born for a given year. Over his or her lifetime, a baby born in 2012 will cost parents an average of $241,080 . Child care, for instance, has increased twice as fast as the median income of families with children since 2000, reports KPTV. In a trend worrisome to many, median income has gone down by $4,000 in America since that same year. ‘Many families are priced out of licensed child care services,’ Lynette Fraga, executive director of Child Care Aware of America told KPTV. ‘If they are priced out, then the health and safety of those children are at risk.’ The annual report is based on data from the Federal government's Consumer Expenditure Survey, which tracks household expenditures. Variables: The number is for median income families with only one child. The number varies depending on geographic location, income, number of children and other factors . For the year 2012, annual child-rearing expenses per child for a middle-income, two-parent family ranged from $12,600 to $14,700, depending on the age of the child. In addition to age, something else that factored into the cost of child rearing was location. The report notes that geographic variations affect the cost of raising a child. Raising a child costs the most in the urban Northeast, according to the study, followed by the urban West and urban Midwest. The lowest expenses were found in the urban South and other rural areas. ‘Lower housing costs contributed to the reduced expenditures for families in rural areas,’ explained study author and economist Mark Lino, Ph.D. ‘Families in rural areas also saw lower child-care and education expenses.’ Add it up: The USDA created a calculator that allows parents to input their location, children's ages, and other factors to estimate their child rearing costs . The USDA created a calculator that families can use to estimate the costs of raising their children, one that allows them to indicate number of children, locale, income level, and other variables. Though intimidating, especially in the light of falling wages, the numbers aren’t startling to those who track such costs. According to the FDA, the 2.6 percent increase from 2011 to 2012 lower than the average annual increase of 4.4 percent since 1960. In 1960, a middle-income family were projected to spend $25,230—that’s $195,690 in 2012 dollars—to raise a child.",A USDA study says child rearing costs are on their way up as wages fall for the 12th year in a row .

'She showed me the house [in Florida]', close friend Mary Sheehan told Boston.com. 'She loved the house. She . couldn’t wait to get there.' Sheehan, 64, said her friend had . health issues, including two prior strokes, and that she hadn't been . feeling well recently, although they enjoyed their night out on . Saturday. She said she regretted not pushing Lobel to visit the doctor. 'I didn’t push it...Maybe if I had pushed it, maybe this wouldn’t have happened,' she said. Curious: Lobel was parked at the front of the complex before she crashed through the fence . Another neighbor, Kim Mayberger, 45, said Lobel was a dedicated member of the apartment complex’s board of trustees. 'I'm just in total shock right now,' Mayberger told Boston.com. Neighbors said the woman was originally from Long Island and worked as an administrative assistant at a local hospital. She had no children, was unmarried, and had no family in the area. She lived alone with her dog, Willy, who was 'like a son'. In 2007, the Patriot Ledger reported that Lobel was a staunch opponent of a permanent lifeguard at the condo's pool, saying the proposal was expensive and unnecessary, since the pool was used by a small number of people. 'It’s extremely restricted who gets in the pool. And everyone who lives there is a watchdog,' she said. Martello, who pulled Lobel from her car yesterday, was the only person at the pool at the time and was a visitor at the complex. Other neighbors came out to help him after hearing the crash.","Diane Lobel, 58, died after crashing her Jeep through the fence of her apartment complex and into the pool .

He is one of the most chilling and grimly fascinating characters to ever hit the silver screen. For decades the exploits of Dr Hannibal Lecter - brilliant psychiatrist, serial killer, cannibal - has thrilled moviegoers and, more recently, in a critically-acclaimed hit TV series. Now author Robert Harris, the monster's creator, has revealed the identity of the real life man who inspired him - a gay Mexican doctor who murdered his lover and was consumed by guilt over it until his dying day. The real-life Hannibal Lecter: Alfredo Balli Trevino was Thomas Harris' inspiration for his most famous creation . Author Thomas Harris (right) has revealed the inspiration for his most chilling creation, Hannibal Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs (left), was in fact a real-life doctor he met in a Mexican prison while working as a journalist . Harris met the doctor at the  Nuevo Leon State Prison, at Monterrey, Mexico, as a 23-year-old journalist. The author was at the prison to interview Dykes Askew Simmons, a former mental patient who was under the death sentence for killing three people. But he met 'Dr Salazar' after learning he had apparently saved the life of Simmons when he had been shot during an attempt to escape from the prison about a year earlier. The true identity of 'Dr Salazar' has now been revealed as Alfredo Balli Trevino, who died in 2009 at 81. Harris met him in 1963 while Balli Trevino was serving 20 years for the murder of his lover Jesús Castillo Rangel. A medical intern at the time, he had slit Rangel's throat with a scalpel in a 'crime of passion' and cut his body into pieces and buried them to hide his crime. The body parts were unearthed by the victim's suspicious uncle. In The Times on Saturday, Harris described the inspiration for Lecter as 'a small, lithe man with dark red hair. He stood very still and there was a certain elegance about him.' Dr Hannibal Lecter, as played by Anthony Hopkins in the 2001 film Red Dragon, is one of the most unforgettable villains in cinematic and literary history . Reporters went to Balli Trevino's former neighbourhood, where residents were reluctant to speak of him. A local man confirmed that he had worked from a small clinic where he cared for poor people and two men said they had received treatment from Balli Trevino, who they described as a 'good person' who never charged them for treatment. A year before his death, Balli Trevino gave an interview to a local newspaper - on the condition his crime would not be discussed. He said: 'If you want we can talk about anything you’d like, except for that. I don’t want to relive my dark past. I don’t want to wake up my ghosts, it’s very hard,' he said. 'I don’t remember how many years I’ve been a doctor. Now I take care of the... the elderly like me.' Harris described how the 1963 interview with Balli Trevino . took a dark twist when the doctor began questioning the . journalist on Simmons's disfigured appearance, the nature of torment and . the murderer's victims. It was . not until Harris left the doctor's office that he learned of Dr . Salazar's history from the prison warden. The doctor was a murderer and the warden told Harris: 'He will never leave this place. He is insane.' Harris says the doctor provided the inspiration behind his most famous creation. He . explained while writing his novel he needed to create a character with a . 'peculiar understanding of the criminal mind', adding: 'It was not Dr . Salazar. But because of Dr Salazar, I could recognise his colleague and . fellow practitioner, Hannibal Lecter.' Lecter was first introduced by Harris in the 1981 novel Red Dragon, where he was depicted as a brilliant psychiatrist and cannibal. He became part of cinematic history however when Hopkins portrayed the character in the Silence of the Lambs, winning an Academy Award for the part along the way. It was in this film that he delivered the immortal line: 'I ate his liver with some fava beans and a nice chianti'. In the film Lecter questions a young FBI trainee Clarice Starling about her childhood traumas, in a scene which is eerily reminiscent of Harris's depiction of his encounter with Dr Salazar. Jodie Foster as Clarice Starling, Harris's detective whose terrifying encoutner with Hannibal Lecter in the film Silence of the Lambs was inspired by a real-life doctor . The first film adapted from Harris's novels was Manhunter, which was based on Red Dragon and featured Brian Cox as Lecter. Hopkins reprised the role however in 2001's Hannibal, where Lecter became the main character of the film. He also played Lecter in a second adaptation of Red Dragon in 2002. The most recent incarnation of Lecter was the NBC series Hannibal, as portrayed by Danish actor Mads Mikkelsen. The character was chosen as the number one movie villain by the American Film Institute in 2003.","Thomas Harris reveals real-life doctor was inspiration for Hannibal Lecter .

"By . Jessica Jerreat . PUBLISHED: . 01:02 EST, 12 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 01:29 EST, 12 August 2013 . What started as a childhood obsession with trains has led to a 49-year-old man spending nearly a third of his life in jail for habitually pretending to be a subway driver. Darius McCollum has been arrested 29 times for driving trains on the subway, stealing buses and pretending to be a conductor and railway worker. 'I've always loved trains, ever since I can remember. I had the whole subway map memorized by the time I was 8,' McCollum said. Arrest: Darius McCollum is escorted from the subway in 2008 after being caught dressing like a transit worker . McCollum, who has spent 18 years in prison, has been at Rikers Island jail since his last arrest in 2010 for stealing a Trailways bus which he used to drive a unwitting airline crew to JFK Airport on. While the case may be familiar to him, McCollum and his family hope the outcome at the trial will be different this time. Attorney Sally Butler believes McCollum's actions are the result of uncontrolled impulses, a byproduct of what was, until recently, called Asperger's syndrome but is now considered an autism spectrum disorder. Obsession: Darius McCollum has spent 18 years in jail because of his love of trains . With the driving force behind his obsession pinpointed, the district attorney's office has taken a different approach. McCollum pleaded guilty to stealing the bus on Thursday, but instead of being sentenced to 15 years as a habitual offender, he will get two and a half to 5 years, and voluntarily undergo cognitive behavioral therapy. 'I really do want to change. I have motivation and people behind me - I think I can do it this time,' he told the Associated Press from jail. McCollum presents a confusing challenge . for the criminal justice system. He is not violent. He just drives the . routes, fixes broken tracks and works alongside other transit employees . without an official job. But, as prosecutors have said, he could cause . an accident or injure someone. 'I just love everything about [the subway].' he told the Wall Street Journal. 'I love the atmosphere, I love the lights, I love the signals. I love the fact that it's moving all the time, 24 hours a day, seven days a week. There's nothing negative I can say about the transit system.' The possibility that McCollum may have Asperger's was raised by a previous lawyer about ten years ago. However, before he could be evaluated he was sentenced by a judge, who dismissed he had the disorder after reading about it online, according to AP. Since that sentence, the disorder has been diagnosed. 'I knew I was different from people, but I didn't realize what was making me different,' he said. His arrests sound vaguely like tall tales where he plays the well-meaning hero. In the most recent case, he claimed to have been hired by Trailways to pick up flight attendants after a driver failed to show up. McCollum's mother has blamed the attention he receives for his crimes as further encouraging him. In 1981, when he was 15, he took over the controls of a subway train, allegedly after the driver became sick. First stop: McCollum was 15 when he drove a train for six stops on the New York subway . Alternative transport: The Asperger's sufferer also loves buses and has been arrested several times for driving off in them . He drove the E train for six stops from 34th Street Penn Station before being caught. His 87-year-old mother, Elizabeth, said . her son relished the publicity surrounding his first case and came away . believing he had done the right thing, according to the Wall Street . Journal. 1981: Arrested after driving an E train filled with passengers from 34th Street to the World Trade Center, aged 15. 1983: Impersonated a subway worker. 1985: Arrested for unauthorized use of a subway repair truck and for driving a city bus in Queens. 1986: Caught stealing a MTA vehicle. 1990: Admits stealing 13 buses over six months and driving them around the city. 1996: Caught sneaking on board a subway train wearing a Transit Authority vest and shirt. 2000: Arrested sneaking into the control tower of the 57th Street station in Manhattan. 2004: Caught trying to take a 60-ton Bombardier M-7 from Long Island. 2006: Parole violations for buying a MTA badge and construction helmet. 2008: Arrested for impersonating an MTA worker at the Columbus Circle subway station. 2008: Arrested at Penn Station for impersonating a federal agent. 2010: Caught driving a stolen bus on the Van Wyck Expressway. Although the charges were dropped, it started the cycle he has been in for years. McCollum has never held a steady job. He took the civil service exam to work for the Metropolitan Transit Authority but did not pass . It would not have mattered anyway, an MTA spokesman said. 'We would not hire anyone who has previously stolen one of our trains.' Further arrests came in 1983, for . impersonating a subway worker; in 1985 for unauthorized use of a subway . repair truck and for driving a city bus in Queens; and in 1986 for . stealing another MTA vehicle. In 1990 he admitted to stealing 13 buses in six months, despite not being caught on each occasion. 'I was just providing a service, volunteering my services and doing good deeds,' he said. Mrs McCollum worries about the attention her son's actions attract. She moved to North Carolina more than two decades ago to try to keep her son away from the tracks - but to no avail. 'He needs help is what he needs,' she said. When she heard of his latest arrest for stealing a bus she told the Daily News she was not surprised. 'He . loves trains more than anything else - buses are his second choice,' she said. 'He loves planes, too, but he hasn't been able to get on one . of those yet.' Michael John Carley, who founded the nonprofit Global and Regional Asperger Syndrome Partnership where McCollum used to attend support group meetings, said no programs exist for autism-spectrum people who get in trouble with the law. Unlike a drink-driver who can avoid jail by going to rehab, McCollum's only option has been jail. 'All of us who have been charged with helping him, we're the ones who have failed him,' Mr Carley said. 'People take one look at him, at his demeanor and his smarts, and they think he should know better. They don't understand because the disorder isn't really understood in this context.' Stop: McCollum's last arrest came after he drove a bus load of airline crew to JFK airport. He was caught as he returned the bus to the depot . His current attorney said it was up to McCollum to get better - or be rearrested and face a longer sentence. 'If I went to a jury trial and argued mental illness, we'd win, but the problem is, they put you in the mental hospital, they keep you there until cured,' she said. 'This can't be cured. It can only managed.' There is hope in sight however. McCollum has said he no longer wants to operate trains because they have become too computerized.","Asperger's sufferer has been arrested 29 times and spent 18 years in jail .

"By . Sarah Griffiths . PUBLISHED: . 07:54 EST, 2 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 07:54 EST, 2 August 2013 . American scientists claim the planet is undergoing one of the largest changes in climate in the past 65 million years. Climatologists at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct. If the trend continues at its current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive, they said. Climatologists at Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment have warned the likely rate of change over the next century will be at least 10 times quicker than any climate shift since the dinosaurs became extinct and this could have a negative impact on some animals, such as polar bears . The findings come from a review of climate research by Earth system science expert Noah Diffenbaugh and Chris Field, a professor of environmental Earth system science and the director of the Department of Global Ecology at the Institution. The work is part of a special report on climate change in the current issue of Science. However, the research is part of a . much bigger picture and other scientists have recently claimed that . global warming has 'paused' for the time being. The professors in this latest study reviewed scientific literature on aspects of . climate change that can affect ecosystems, and investigated how recent . observations and projections for the next century compare to past events . in Earth's history. If temperatures continue to rise at their current rapid pace, it will place significant stress on terrestrial ecosystems around the world, and many species like the giant panda in China will need to make behavioral, evolutionary or geographic adaptations to survive, the scientists said . Scientists from the Met Office take a different view when it comes to the future of our planet . They have claimed global warming has 'paused' but this is not unexpected and temperatures will still continue to rise. Heat going into the deep ocean is part of the reason global average surface temperatures have increased at a lower rate in the past 10 to 15 years than in previous decades, they explained. Recent low solar activity and volcanic eruptions, which send particles into the atmosphere that reflect heat, have also contributed to a slowing in temperature rises, while natural climate variations also play a part. But experts and climate scientists believe global warming has not stopped but paused - with the average rate of warming just 0.04C per decade between 1998 and 2012, compared with 0.17C per decade from 1970-1998. The scientists said periods of slow-down or 'pauses' in surface warming are not unusual in temperature records and are predicted in climate models, which suggests such periods could occur at least twice a century because of natural variation. For instance, the planet experienced a sharp rise in temperature by 5 . degree Celsius 20,000 years ago, as Earth emerged . from the last ice age. This is a change comparable to the high-end of . the projections for warming over the 20th and 21st centuries, according to the reserachers. The geologic record shows that, 20,000 years ago, as the ice sheet that covered much of North America receded northward, plants and animals recolonised areas that had been under ice. As the climate continued to warm, those plants and animals moved northward, to cooler climes. Professor Diffenbaugh said: 'We know from past changes that ecosystems have responded to a few degrees of global temperature change over thousands of years. 'But the unprecedented trajectory that we're on now is forcing that change to occur over decades. 'That's orders of magnitude faster, and we're already seeing that some species are challenged by that rate of change.' Some of the strongest evidence for how the global climate system responds to high levels of carbon dioxide comes from paleoclimate studies. 55 million years ago, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was elevated to a level comparable to today, the scientists said. The Arctic Ocean did not have ice in the summer and nearby land was warm enough to support alligators and palm trees. The scientists said that 55 million years ago, carbon dioxide in the atmosphere was elevated to a level comparable to today. The Arctic Ocean did not have ice in the summer (as pictured) and nearby land was warm enough to support alligators and palm trees . 'There are two key differences for ecosystems in the coming decades compared with the geologic past,' Professor Diffenbaugh said. 'One is the rapid pace of modern climate change. 'The other is that today there are multiple human stressors that were not present 55 million years ago, such as urbanisation and air and water pollution.' The professors also examined results from two-dozen climate models to describe possible climate outcomes from present day to the end of the century. In general, extreme weather events, such as heat waves and heavy rainfall, are expected to become more severe and more frequent. For example, the researchers said that, . with continued emissions of greenhouse gases at the high end of the . scenarios, annual temperatures over North America, Europe and East Asia . will increase by two to four degrees Celsius between 2046 and 2065. A cracked lake bed in Texas. Extreme weather events, such as heat waves and heavy rainfall, are expected to become more severe and more frequent, according to the research . With that amount of warming, the hottest summer of the last 20 years is expected to occur every other year, or even more frequently. The scientists claim that by the end of the century, should the current emissions of greenhouse gases remain unchecked, temperatures over the northern hemisphere will be five to six degrees Celcius warmer than today's averages. Diffenbaugh said: 'It's not easy to intuit the exact impact from annual temperatures warming by six [degrees Celsius]. 'This would present a novel climate for most land areas. Given the impacts those kinds of seasons currently have on terrestrial forests, agriculture and human health, we'll likely see substantial stress from severely hot conditions.' The scientists also projected the velocity of climate change, defined as the distance per year that species of plants and animals would need to migrate to live in annual temperatures similar to current conditions. Around the world, including much of the United States, species face the need to move toward the poles or higher in the mountains by at least one kilometer per year.","American scientists said if temperatures keep rising at the current rapid pace, significant stress will be places on terrestrial ecosystems .

An Alaska serial killer buried three victims in Washington state and submerged two others in a lake but refused to provide more details as to their whereabouts, according to interviews released on Tuesday by the FBI. Israel Keyes, who committed suicide in his Anchorage jail cell last year, is now believed to have killed 11 people. The FBI posted more than six hours of videotaped interviews online that agents, Anchorage police and federal prosecutors conducted with Israel Keyes in the months before he killed himself. Scroll down for the newly-released video . Chilling record: Six hours of videotaped interviews with Israel Keyes were released this week months before the serial killer's suicide in an Anchorage jail . In a November 29 interview, just three days before he committed suicide in his jail cell with a razor blade, Keyes asked if investigators had found any knives at his New York property or on a boat he owned in Washington state. He said there were two knives missing from his girlfriend's home in Anchorage, and he didn't know where they were. He was particularly concerned about a Cold Steel Tanto - 4 1/2-inch folding knife he bought in Port Angeles, Washington. Bloody trail: The FBI believe that Keyes murdered 11 people . Asked by Assistant U.S. Attorney Kevin Feldis why the knife was important, Keyes indicated authorities might find something if they took it apart. Authorities asked if it was blood? 'Well, there might, not on it, maybe inside somewhere,' Keyes replied. He said, 'yeah,' when asked if the knife was associated with one of the Washington killings. FBI Special Agent Jolene Goeden probed deeper, asking if a body were found at the bottom of a lake, would it still be intact. 'Were they contained in something or were they just tied to the milk jugs?' she asked. 'No,' he responded. Goeden asked: 'I mean, is it something where we, we might possible actually still get an intact ...' 'No,' Keyes repeated, cutting her off. He later indicated the folding blade wasn't the primary means of death. Asked if the victims were shot or strangled, Keyes replied after chuckling: 'You'll get the whole story eventually.' He then relented and said the only victim shot was Bill Currier in Vermont. All others were strangled except one Washington victim, who was hit in the head and killed as Keyes tried to subdue him. Feldis and another assistant U.S. attorney, Frank Russo, decided in the taped interview that the Washington state couple were buried in a hole and not submerged in the lake. Keyes replied: 'Yeah, that was a while ago.' Keyes worked for the Makah Indian tribe in Washington state after he got out of the Army in July 2001. 'It wasn't that long that you, um, killed somebody and it was that sort of feeling that you needed ... ' Feldis said. 'Yeah, Neah Bay's a boring town,' Keyes replied. Later, the questioning turned to the bodies in the lake, and Keyes seemingly chastised his interrogators about not figuring out one of the locations. 'You guys know about Lake Crescent in Washington, right?' he said. Feldis asked: 'And that's the lake?' 'That's one of the lakes,' Keyes replied. Keyes indicated he weighed the body or bodies down with four to five milk jugs. 'Just for one body,' Feldis asked. 'Yeah,' Keyes said. Keyes killed himself while he awaited trial for the abduction, rape and murder of Samantha Koenig (pictured) The FBI believes one victim was killed in Neah Bay shortly after Keyes was released from the Army. The other two people buried in Washington state are believed to have been killed from July 2001 to 2005. The other two victims in the state were believed to have been killed in 2005 or 2006. After his arrests in 2012, Keyes was charged with the murder of 17-year-old Samantha Koenig, an Anchorage barista who was kidnapped from the coffee stand where she worked. Her dismembered body was pulled from a lake north of Anchorage two months after she went missing. Keyes later confessed to the 2011 murders of Bill and Lorraine Currier of Essex, Vermont, and indicated to authorities there were victims in a total of 10 states. Keyes never disclosed much information about the other crimes, trying to keep as many details as possible out of the media so his daughter wouldn't be able to find any information up on the Internet or his mother wouldn't have a heart attack reading what he did. He was in constant negotiations with investigators, oftentimes frustrating them on not releasing information as he said he would. Officials released the updated . timeline of travels and crimes involving Keyes this week, which sheds new light on a . case that left a trail of unsolved killings across the U.S. The material shows Keyes' movements across the country before his arrest in Texas on March 13, 2012. However, investigators have had leads run dry on a number of other victims and are seeking the public's help. FBI . spokesman Eric Gonzalez said they hope the information will help . identify victims who remain unknown and provide some closure to their . families. 'We've exhausted all our investigative leads,' Gonzalez said. The FBI documents said Keyes frequented prostitutes during his travels and killed an unidentified couple in Washington state sometime between July 2001 and 2005. Video surveillance captures moment Keyes approached Koenig in the coffee shop and abducted her . Bill and Lorraine Currier were the only other people Keyes specifically admitted to murdering . Keyes told investigators that only . one other body - other than Koenig - had ever been recovered but that . victim's death was ruled as accidental. The bodies of the Curriers were . never found. The FBI said Keyes admitted frequenting prostitutes, but it's unknown if Keyes met any of his victims this way. Officials said Keyes told them he robbed several banks to fund his travels along with money he made as a general contractor. The father-of-one also told authorities he broke into as many as 30 homes throughout the country, and he talked about covering up a homicide through arson. The timeline begins in summer of 1997 or 1998, when Keyes abducted a teenage girl while she and friends were tubing on the Deschutes River, he told investigators. The FBI said Keyes was living in Maupin, Oregon, at the time, and the abduction is believed to have occurred near that area. The FBI said Keyes lived in Neah Bay, Washington in 2001 after he was discharged from the Army. The timeline states that Keyes committed his first homicide while living in the area. The identity of the victim is not known, and neither is the location of the murder. Keyes moved to Anchorage in 2007 but continued to travel extensively outside the state. FBI say Keyes killed his first victim in Neah Bay, Washington, in 2001 after being discharged from the Army . After killing Koenig, Keyes flew to New Orleans where he went on a cruise. He left Koenig's body in a shed outside his Anchorage home for two weeks, according to the FBI. After the cruise, Keyes drove to Texas. The FBI said that during this time, Keyes may have been responsible for a homicide in Texas or a nearby state - a crime Keyes denied. He was arrested in Lufkin, Texas, about six weeks after Koenig's disappearance. Keyes had sought a ransom and used Koenig's debit card.

A 77-year-old dementia patient has spent nearly a week languishing in prison after allegedly stabbing a woman at her senior care facility with a comb. Police arrested Martha Glover at California's Solano Life House, a home for dementia patients, following reports the grandmother stabbed an elderly woman in the face and head nearly a week ago. While she has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, her family says she shouldn't have been arrested in the first place because of her illness. Tragic: Dementia patient Martha Glover, 77, has spent nearly a week in prison after allegedly stabbing an elderly woman at her care facility . Dementia is a chronic disorder characterized by memory loss, disorientation and inability to follow directions. Glover's daughter Lenore Dangerfield told CBS the care facility was responsible for her mother and she should not have been arrested. 'She doesn’t drive. She doesn’t take . care of any of her own affairs. She can’t hold a lucid conversation,' she said. Dangerfield said police were aware of . Glover’s violent outbursts because they say they had been to the . facility before. This is California's Solano Life House where Martha Glover, 77, was arrested . Civil rights attorney Jeff Kravitz says the care facility in charge failed the suspect - who has spent six days in jail - and the victim. 'I don’t think the police ultimately had much choice about making the initial arrest,' he told CBS. 'Indeed the police have the right to . detain people who have serious psychological problems if they are a . danger to themselves or others. 'They [the nursing home] knew of the . condition of the attacker - for lack of a better word. They have a duty . and responsibility to protect her, even against her own actions.' CBS said the facility did not return calls.","A 77-year-old dementia sufferer has spent six days in prison after stabbing a fellow nursing home patient .

If there was a badge for being effortlessly stylish, surely the Duchess of Cambridge would have earned it yesterday. With her 60s tweed cap at a jaunty angle and a red, white and blue UK Scouts neckerchief, Kate even made a snowy camp in Cumbria look chic. With her outfit completed by Le Chameau wellies and a green jacket which hid her baby bump, the 31-year-old Duchess braved the 1C cold to learn how to light a camp fire, then took off her fingerless mittens to cook unleavened bread on a stick . Scroll down for video . Campfire's burning: The Duchess joked that her attempt at making a 'damper' from dough 'didn't look particularly edible' as she joined Scout volunteers today to hone her skills . Jovial: Kate laughs with the other volunteers as she looks the part in a red, white and blue neckerchief - which she knotted instead of tying with a woggle . Role model: The Scout Association hope their royal supporter will encourage other young adults to get involved in Scouting . Braving the cold: The Duchess of Cambridge during her visit to the Great Tower Scout Camp near Newby Bridge in Cumbria today where temperatures plummeted to minus five . Clearly enjoying herself, she giggled . as she wrestled with the bread. And her verdict on the result? 'Oh, it's . actually not bad, if you were really desperately hungry,' she laughed. The Duchess became a volunteer with her local Cub Scouts pack in Anglesey, North Wales, last year. She has some experience to call upon, . enrolling at eight as a Brownie in the 1st St Andrew's pack in . Pangbourne, Berkshire. Yesterday she joined other adult volunteers as . they trained to work with Beaver and Cub Scouts at Great Tower Scout . Camp, Cumbria. Simon Carter of the Scout Association said the . organisation needs adult volunteers. He said: 'The reason we value the . Duchess's support so much is that she helps out when she can. She is . very busy. We want to say to people: “You can come when you can and we . will work around you”.' One of the pack: Kate Middleton in the Brownies in September 1990 (right) Getting stuck in: The Duchess plunged her hands into a doughy mixture of flour, water and sugar as she learned how to make a campfire treat for children . Success: The group managed to get a fire going despite the falling snow . 'It's quite sugary': Kate wasn't convinced her cooking skills were up to scratch . The five month pregnant Duchess was . undeterred by the conditions, plunging her hands into a doughy mixture . of flour, water and sugar as she learned how to make 'dampers' or . 'twists' - a campfire treat for children. There were cheers and claps as the instructor, despite the wind and snow, managed to create a flame. Kate, still wearing her sparkling wedding and . engagement rings, then delved her hands into a squidgy mixture of flour, water, oil and sugar. She kneaded the dough in a bowl for . several minutes before they made elongated twists out of the pastry by . rubbing blobs of the mixture between their hands. After washing the dough mix off her . hands Kate wrapped a twist of the messy mixture around a twig stripped . of bark which was placed over the open fire ready to toast. The show must go on: Kate didn't let the snow stop her visit although she did arrive via train rather than helicopter thanks to the conditions . Be prepared: Kate learnt the Scouts continue with their activities whatever the weather . The volunteers' efforts had mixed . results, with the Duchess laughing and giggling with the others as some . of the twisters dropped into the flames. 'I'm not sure if these are going to look particularly edible,' Kate laughed. After several minutes toasting on the fire Kate pulled off a piece of the bread and, rather gingerly, popped it in her mouth. 'Oh, its actually not bad,' she told the group. 'It is quite sugary though.' Becky Coates, 38, who helped the Duchess make 'twists' to toast on the . fire said: 'It was great fun, she's lovely. You can tell she enjoys it . and got stuck in, she was straight in there. She was just treated as one of us, scouting does that, it's an amazing atmosphere.' Ms Coates, from the Sedgwick and Crosscrake Beavers in Kendal, added: 'She said, 'Maybe see you again in another scouting field'. She chuckled that it could not have been much colder. It shows you can do scouting in all weather. Not an awful lot can put us off.' Down with the kids: After lunch, the Duchess met children from Scout and Cub groups who tried some tree climbing . Passing on her skills: Kate showed the children how to safely light a fire . After lunch with the volunteers it . was time for the Duchess to teach her new-found skills to a group of . children - as the snow got even thicker. The adults were joined by around 30 . youngsters, aged between eight and ten and from the Medlock Scout group . in Manchester and other scouts and cubs from groups in Hawkshead and . Holme in Cumbria. Kate knelt in the snow to show them . how to make fire from sparks using flints and cotton wool, cheering . along after one youngster - after several attempts, managed to create a . flame. Later she viewed children practising . climbing with ropes. The Duchess watched as Khiara Keating, aged eight, . from the 465th Manchester Scout Group, struggled to climb up a tree. Suitable attire: Five months pregnant Kate wore a khaki jacket with her trusty £300 Le Chameau wellington boots and favourite blue £29.99 Zara jeans . Keeping the snow off her famously bouncy locks: Her bakerboy style tweed hat is £49 from Really Wild Clothing . 'I bet it feels a lot higher up there,' Kate said, before the youngster, 20 feet up, shouted down, 'I can't do it!' The child was winched down and received a hug from the royal visitor for her efforts. Connor Childs and Fatima Vukhari, both aged nine and from a scout group in Ardwick, Manchester, both learned about making fire with flint from the Duchess. Fatima said: 'She showed us how to do it. It was hard because the snow was putting the sparks out. It was fun. She seemed like a princess, she looked pretty and had lovely hair.' Fatima who gave the Duchess a brown teddy bear for her new baby added: 'Me and my friend got her a gift for her baby. She said it's really cute. We didn't do it pink or blue because they said it might be a girl or a boy.' Delightful company: The other volunteers said Kate was 'lovely' and was treated just like everyone else . The Duchess was originally scheduled . to come up to Cumbria by helicopter until the weather forecast was . looked at, according to palace officials. Instead she came by train from London this morning, arriving at nearby Oxenholme Station around midday. Kate, said to be 'passionate' about volunteering, helps out occasionally at a Scout group close to her home in North Wales. The Scout Association is hoping the . visit by one of the country's most high-profile figures will encourage . other young adults to get involved in Scouting. More . adult volunteers are needed for the 35,000 young people currently . waiting to join the movement, which already has well over half a million . members. Simon Carter, assistant director of . The Scout Association, said: 'The Duchess works with eight to . 10-year-olds, she's learned how to do stuff when she goes to cubs on . Wednesday evenings. 'The Queen is the Patron of the . Scouts, last year when the Duchess committed to her charity work she . didn't want to be just a figurehead, she wanted to do something . meaningful. She's passionate about volunteering.

Thirteen-year-old Sam Horowitz grinned as he performed with backing dancers on Good Morning America - while his mother revealed he planned his glitzy stage entrance when he was just nine. 'At a very young age, I took him to his first concert,' Angela Horowitz explained. 'Dancers came from the ceiling on chandeliers and he said, ""Mom, I'm gonna do that for my bar mitzvah"".

On Broadway: Sam Horowitz, whose bar mitzvah dance became an internet hit, danced on GMA on Thursday . Passionate: The teenager, from Dallas, Texas, said his new found fame felt 'like a dream' The teenager, from Dallas, Texas, took the internet by storm when the video, which was filmed last November, appeared on a Jewish parenting site. It now ranks as the most popular video on YouTube. The video shows backup dancers, a stage with his name in giant letters and an enormous round box that drops from the ceiling to . give the impression that Horowitz was lowered onto the stage. 'I would rehearse every Sunday for a month for three hours with my very good choreographer,' he told GMA, adding that his new-found fame is 'like a dream'. 'I never thought this would happen in my entire life,' he said. The performance took place at the Omni Hotel in Dallas, and footage of the routine was posted on Youtube on November 26, 2012.

Excited: Sam said he had practiced for three hours every Sunday for a month before his bar mitzvah performance . It was then posted to the Jewish parenting website Raising Kvell and has since gone viral. Reactions . to the performance on the Internet were mixed - some people called the . routine fabulous, others found it 'vulgar' and some people even went so . far as to attack the boy's sexuality. 'What is this? ""Keeping up with the Steins""? Sorry, I find it vulgar, . ostentatious, and humiliating,' commented Gary Goldstein, a physician from Oro Valley. 'Was this for the benefit of the parents . or the kid? All that was missing was a stripper pole.'

Another person commented that, 'Sam is going to make some man very happy one day,' while another added that 'this little boy has to be gay because there would be no other reason to . have something over the top for him. He's turning 13 years old he's not a . burlesque dancer.' This isn't Horowitz's first performance, though - prior to his bar mitzvah dance routine, Horowitz filmed his own music video for the Carly Rae Jepsen hit 'Call Me Maybe.'

According to a police report, 52-year-old Terry Boyd was arrested around 4am Monday when two witnesses called police saying they heard an loud argument and a man screaming for help at her Wausau, Wisconsin home. When police arrived they found two men trapped in a room on the second floor. The front door was locked and Boyd was sitting against the door to stop the officers from entering. One of the men dropped a set of keys to the officers. Boyd was apparently combative with officers during the process. One of the men said he was a roommate of Boyd's and that she locked them in the room, saying she wouldn't let them leave until one of them had sex with her. The men left the residence saying they didn't want to press charges against Boyd. After police left Boyd called the hospital, a counseling agency and emergency dispatchers saying the police had 'beaten her up.' An ambulance arrived and took her to the Aspirus Wausau Hospital where she, again, became combative with medical personal and was arrested for disorderly conduct.

Skeletal remains found in the Arizona desert could be those of a 19-year-old student who went missing in June, police said. More than 100 officers combed the sparse desert in Apache Junction, near Tempe, where the body was discovered by a property owner on August 6. Because the remains were so decomposed, authorities have only confirmed they believe it could be college student Adrienne Salinas today. Missing: Police believe a body found in the desert could be college student Adrienne Salinas . Miss Salinas went missing in the early hours of June 15 as she headed to her boyfriend's home after the couple rowed at a party. She had called for a cab at about 4am but when the driver turned up, she was already gone, according to Fox 10. When the body was found near Highway 88, detectives checked missing persons databases to see if there would be a match. Miss Salinas was the only listed in the area. Similarities between Miss Salinas and the body were noted, although police did not highlight what they were. They are now waiting for DNA results to confirm if the remains are hers. Her family were notified that a body had been found last week. Miss Salinas' father, Rick Salinas, told 3TV he was heartbroken and 'too sick' for words. He declined to say anything more about the possibility that his daughter might be dead. Search: More than 100 officers began combing the area near Apache Junction where the remains were found . Questions: The body was found off Route 88 but police do not know if it was dumped there or had washed away . Tests: Authorities are awaiting the results of DNA to see if the remains belong to Adrienne . Mr Salinas had raised the alarm after dropping round to see his daughter on June 16 and finding her door unlocked. He said he had been concerned when she failed to call him on Father's Day, according to HLN. More than 100 officers from the FBI and Tempe Police used rakes to search the area around where the body was found at 5am to cover as much ground as possible before the 110F midday temperatures. 'The area where the remains were located has been searched several times since the recovery, but today investigators from multiple agencies will search an even larger area, much of it consisting of rough terrain,'Tempe police sergeant Mike Pooley told 3TV. 'We're looking for any kind of clues that might help us solve this case.' Police have said they suspect foul play, but they do not know if the body was dumped in the desert or washed there in a recent flood. Concern: Adrienne with her father Rick, who reported her missing when she failed to call on Father's Day . Vigil: Family and friends have been trying to help find Adrienne . Miss Salinas was last seen by her housemates . in the early hours of June 15. They had held a party, at which the . teenager and her boyfriend had argued. She was seen leaving her apartment with a small bag after 3am and at 3.45am a witness reported seeing her car being driven erratically. It was later found abandoned, with two flat tires. According to cell phone records, the 19-year-old called for a cab and made several missed calls to her boyfriend, Francisco Arteaga, at about 4am. Her last message to him read: 'I'm coming overt [sic]'. It was sent at 4..43am shortly before her phone went dead. Shortly after she went missing Mr Arteaga told CBS5: 'It's impossible not to think about her. There's never been a week where I haven't seen her. It's been three weeks now. It's scary.'

The father of missing Utah woman Susan Powell - who has been missing since 2009 - is determined to keep looking for his daughter even though police have given up, and still has hope she may be alive, it emerged today. Chuck Cox, from Oregon, has now dedicated his life to finding his daughter and spends most of his days traveling along Interstate 84 - where he believes Josh Powell may have disposed of her body - and following up tips. He retired from his job as a veteran crash investigator with the Federal Aviation Administration so he could spend his days searching. His experience tells him his daughter - who was just 28-years-old when she disappeared - is dead, but the father in him dearly wants to believe she is alive. Grieving: Mrs Powell's parents Chuck and Judy Cox outside their home after their grandsons' death. Chuck said he will not stop searching for his daughter . Missing: Susan Powell vanished from the couple's Utah home in 2009. She had said she feared her husband . Remembrance: Chuck and Judy Cox, left, are joined by Susan's sister Denise Cox, right, and her fiancé, Andrew Olsen, at Woodbine Cemetery in Puyallup, where Susan's sons Charlie and Braden Powell are buried . Susan Powell was last seen at her home on December 6, 2009. Her husband Josh took their two sons on an impromptu camping trip even though it was mid winter and freezing temperatures. He was later named a person of interest but was never arrested in the case. Cox strongly believed he was responsible for the disappearance of Susan and begged police to arrest Josh. But they never did, and three years later during a supervised visit with his sons, Josh took an axe to them and killed them before setting his Washington home on fire, killing all three of them. His brother has since committed suicide and his father is currently serving time in jail for voyeurism. Cox believes that all three of them had a hand in Susan's disappearance. Due to the stress of the ordeal, Cox has lost 60 pounds. It has also taken its toll on his relationship with his wife and remaining daughters who want him to give up. 'If it were up to me, I'd pack up and be gone. I'd buy a camper and stay on the road until I found her,' he told the LA Times. 'I tell my daughters I love them, but that I'm going to find Susan. I'm not going to give up on her. I can't.' One of his daughters Denise Olsen, 34, sometimes helps her dad on his searches and explains how - even four years later - her sister's disappearance still has a heavy effect on him. Piling on the pressure: In newly-released tapes, Josh Powell evaded questions from the police the day after his wife Susan disappeared in 2009 . Family tragedy: Susan Cox Powell, pictured with her sons Charlie and Braden, disappeared in 2009. Her husband Josh killed himself and their sons in 2012 . 'After losing Susan, he's been a lot . more open and understanding,' she said. 'But every time he talks of not . stopping until he finds her, his eyes tear up. And you just have to . change the subject.' Cox is getting no help from police - they stopped their search for Susan in . May announcing they had run out of leads and had no choice but to wait . for new information. This frustrates him greatly as he believes they are holding on to vital evidence which could help him finally find his daughter. Cox is considering suing West Valley City police because they refuse to . release case files and have treated him like he is a 'meddling parent . rather than a veteran investigator', he said. 'I was the victim's father, a parent. The idea was, ""We can't trust him. He's a civilian, not . capable of grasping the intricacies of police work"". In reality, I was a . veteran investigator.

Police officers at this year's Hempfest festival in Seattle will dish out bags of Doritos with messages outlining the new marijuana laws in Washington . Normally when the police show up it means the party's over. But police officers in Seattle will be adding to the fun this weekend by providing snacks at an marijuana festival. Seattle Police Department's spokesman, Sergeant Sean Whitcomb, said the department intends to use the opportunity to spread the word about new marijuana laws, by attaching a summarized version to bags of Doritos. The law came into effect in 2012, and allows anyone to legally possess up to an ounce of recreational marijuana. But police are worried people still aren't clear enough on the rules. So, with the help of a former journalist, the Seattle Police Department has composed its own guide to the law , 'Marijwhatnow?'. “When the laws changed, there was a little bit of an informational vacuum about how police would react,” Whitcomb told nbc news. 'Marijwhatnow' clearly states that Seattle police will not arrest anyone for possessing under an ounce of marijuana, but also outlines the rules that do still exist in the state, and at federal level. Hempfest is an annual Seattle event where marijuana enthusiasts gather in protest of strict cannabis laws. It is expected to attract over 200,000 people this weekend . Police will hand out 1,000 bags of Doritos at Hempfest 2013, which is expected to attract around 200,000 people. 'We’re there to let people know what the rules are. Not everybody will get a bag, but hopefully people will talk about what’s allowed and what’s not.' Seattle's Hempfest is the largest gathering advocating cannabis decriminalization in the world. It is expected to span two miles of Seattle parks on Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Sergeant Whitcomb is also a due to speak at the three-day event. 'We wanted to do something in a fun way that said, ""look this is cool and everything but the rules are the rules""he said. 'I’ll probably throw out a few bags of Doritos.' Can I legally carry around an ounce of marijuana? According to the recently passed initiative, beginning December . 6th, adults over the age of 21 will be able to carry up to an ounce . of marijuana for personal use. Please note that the initiative says it “is . unlawful to open a package containing marijuana…in view of the general public,” so there’s that. Also, you probably shouldn’t bring pot with you to the federal . courthouse (or any other federal property). Where can I legally buy pot, then? The Washington State Liquor Control Board is working to establish guidelines . for the sale and distribution of marijuana. The WSLCB has until December 1, 2013 . to finalize those rules. In the meantime, production and distribution of . non-medical marijuana remains illegal. Can I grow marijuana in my home and sell it to my friends, family, . and co-workers? Not right now. In the future, under state law, you may be able to get a . license to grow or sell marijuana. Can I smoke pot outside my home? Like at a park, magic show, or the . Bite of Seattle? Much like having an open container of alcohol in public, doing so could . result in a civil infraction—like a ticket—but not arrest. You can certainly use . marijuana in the privacy of your own home. Additionally, if smoking a cigarette . isn’t allowed where you are (say, inside an apartment building or flammable . chemical factory), smoking marijuana isn’t allowed there either. Will police officers be able to smoke marijuana? As of right now, no. This is still a very complicated issue. If I apply for a job at the Seattle Police Department, will past (or . current) marijuana use be held against me? The current standard for . applicants is that they have not used marijuana in the previous three years. In . light of I-502, the department will consult with the City Attorney and the State . Attorney General to see if and how that standard may be revised. What happens if I get pulled over and an officer thinks I’ve been . smoking pot? If an officer believes you’re driving under the influence of anything, they . will conduct a field sobriety test and may consult with a drug recognition . expert. If officers establish probable cause, they will bring you to a precinct . and ask your permission to draw your blood for testing. If officers have reason . to believe you’re under the influence of something, they can get a warrant for a . blood draw from a judge. If you’re in a serious accident, then a blood draw will . be mandatory. The Seattle Police Department seized a bunch of my marijuana before I-502 passed. Can I have it . back? No. Will Seattle Police Department assist federal law enforcement in investigations of . marijuana users or marijuana-related businesses, that are allowed under . I-502? No. Officers and detectives will not participate in an investigation of . anything that’s not prohibited by state law. December 6th seems like a really long ways away. What . happens if I get caught with marijuana before then?   Hold your breath. Your case will be processed under current state law. However, there is already a . city ordinance making marijuana enforcement the lowest law enforcement . priority. I’m under 21. What happens if I get caught smoking pot? It’s a violation of state law. It may referred to prosecutors, just like if . you were a minor in possession of alcohol.

The 54-year-old was crying as she described the late pop star’s fear of pain and trust of physicians during her testimony. Scroll down for video . Witness: Debbie Rowe testified in ex-husband Michael Jackson's wrongful death trial in LA on Wednesday . Emotional: The 54-year-old broke down in tears as she described Jacko's 'incredible fear of pain' ‘Michael had a very low pain tolerance and his fear of pain was incredible,’ Rowe said. ‘I think the doctors took advantage of him that way.’ Rowe described how Jackson trusted doctors to prescribe pain medication to him, but felt his longtime dermatologist Dr. Arnold Klein and plastic surgeon Dr. Steven Hoefflin sometimes tried to outdo each other while losing sight of Jackson's care. ‘These idiots were going back and forth the whole time, not caring about him,’ Rowe told jurors. The mother of Jackson’s eldest two children, Prince and Paris, added that the one doctor she did trust was Allan Metzger, and she told him she was concerned that Klein and Hoefflin were giving the singer too many medications. Somber: Debbie claimed doctors were 'over-medicating' the star who had a low tolerance for pain . ‘The only physician who ever did anything, the only physician who cared for Michael was Allan Metzger,’ Rowe said, fighting back tears. A phone message left at Klein's office was not immediately returned.

Rowe described her first meeting with Jackson in the early 1980s, when he came into Klein's office for treatment of acne. She said Klein often met with . celebrity patients on weekends and after-hours so they could avoid . scrutiny, and in her first meeting with Jackson she asked him to come . into the office for future visits at a more convenient time.

A little girl growing up today has no shortage of strong female role models - senators and presidential candidates, CEOs and astronauts, governors and secretaries of state. And now, a female Wiggle. Emma Watkins, the first woman to join The Wiggles - a sort of Australian fab four of the preschool set - is making her U.S. debut, kicking off a nationwide tour in Philadelphia on Saturday and starring in new episodes of 'Ready, Steady, Wiggle!' on Sprout on Aug. 19. In the Crayola-coded Wiggles world, Emma . is the Yellow Wiggle, and on early portions of the tour in Australia . and Canada, she attracted enough tiny yellow clones with enormous bows . on their heads that they called it the Mini-Emma Army. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . A rock star for the preschool set: Emma Watkins, the first woman to join The Wiggles - a sort of Australian fab four of the preschool set - is making her U.S. debut in Philadelphia on Saturday . 'We've seen so many children arrive at the show dressed like me, head to toe with the big yellow bow, but they're not changing the size of the bow so it's bigger than their heads,' Watkins said by phone from Australia. Watkins is joined in the new version of the group by original Blue Wiggle Anthony Field and two fellow newbies: Red Wiggle Simon Pryce and Purple Wiggle Lachlan Gillespie. But she's clearly a fan favorite: Tiny groupies have given her so many bows - yellow and pink, made from pipe cleaners and cardboard - that she quips she'll need an extra room on her house to hold them. 'Essentially we're all role models for boys AND girls, but it's really nice that girls have a choice, I guess,' she says. With . their peppy dancing, waggling fingers, exaggerated facial expressions . and maniacally catchy songs like 'Hot Potato' and 'Fruit Salad,' The . Wiggles emerged 22 years ago and seemed scientifically engineered to . make a toddler, well, wiggle. The new members were announced last year . and joined the retiring original Wiggles - Greg Page, Jeff Fatt and . Murray Cook - on a farewell tour as 'Wiggles in Training.' The Mini-Emma Army: In the Crayola-coded Wiggles world, Emma is the Yellow Wiggle, and on the tour in Australia and Canada, she attracted tiny yellow clones with enormous bows on their heads . Watkins, 23, grew up with The Wiggles and sharing the stage with Page, the original Yellow Wiggle, she says, 'I just felt like I was 6 years old again.' The first time Gillespie sang 'Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star' with Page, he cried. Each new member came from the touring cast of backup dancers and understudies, but there was much Wiggly wisdom to impart - Wiggly fingers, Wiggly dancing, Wiggly songs and instruments. And there was the mentoring offstage, where the new Wiggles hosted meet-and-greets with children with special needs. 'They turn up and all they do is look at . Emma the whole time. These 2 and . 3-year-olds have never seen The Wiggles before, so Emma's their superstar' 'There were no reality TV cameras rolling at the time - it sort of sounds like it - but no one was going to be eliminated. It was just a lovely year,' Field said. Field was studying childhood education with Cook and Page when he formed the group back in 1991, hoping to combine what he was learning with his other passion, music. The Wiggles became a sensation in Australia and made their biggest splash across the pond about a decade later, helping launch 'Playhouse Disney' on the Disney Channel. They helped popularize children's music . on TV and ushered in an era of arena-packing kiddie concerts - at their . peak, they sold out 12 shows at the Theater at Madison Square Garden. 'I think The Wiggles were the ones . who said, this is going to be a show. It's going to be a rock concert of . sorts, and I think just like the TV show, they were doing these sorts . of big, energetic pop concerts,' says Stefan Shepherd, who writes about . children's music at Zooglobble.com and reviews it for NPR's 'All Things . Considered.' All told, . The Wiggles sold more than 23 million DVDs and videos, 7 million CDs and . 8 million books. They have been broadcast in more than 100 countries . and performed more concerts than the Rolling Stones. The new guard: Watkins is joined in the group by original Blue Wiggle Anthony Field and two fellow newbies: Red Wiggle Simon Pryce and Purple Wiggle Lachlan Gillespie. But she's clearly a fan favorite . Preschool hit: With their peppy dancing, waggling fingers, exaggerated facial expressions and maniacally catchy songs, The Wiggles seem scientifically engineered to make a toddler, well, wiggle . But all that touring took its toll. In 2006, Page left the group because of a rare nervous system disorder. Fatt briefly left the tour to be fitted with a pacemaker. Page rejoined in 2012, but soon he, Fatt and Cook announced their retirement. Field, who documented his own struggles with depression in a book, 'How I Got My Wiggle Back,' says it was an easy decision for him to stay on and be joined by new members. 'The first month or so, it was very strange but it was still exciting,' he says. 'I think one of the reasons I love being on the road and continuing on is I get a routine going, I keep myself healthy, I eat well and have a really, really healthy lifestyle and I exercise all the time. I'm 50 now but I'm in the best shape of my life.' The Wiggles may not be quite the phenomenon they used to be - when they stop in New York on this tour, they'll be playing just one show at the Best Buy Theater. Seen as a refreshing alternative to Barney when they debuted, they predated the revolution in more parent-friendly 'kindie' music led by the likes of Dan Zanes, Laurie Berkner, Elizabeth Mitchell and They Might Be Giants. 'If parents come away saying that wasn't . nearly as bad as I expected, then that's just gravy for them. Because . they're not playing for the parents' But parents aren't The Wiggles' target audience, and there's no doubt they can inspire a room of toddlers. 'If parents come away saying that wasn't nearly as bad as I expected, then that's just gravy for them. Because they're not playing for the parents,' Shepherd says. Some songs impart a lesson - new song 'Peanut Butter' is about food allergies, for example - while others are meant to get children up and dancing. (The group is conscious of the dangers of screen time, even if they are creatures of television.) And for a new generation of fans, these are The Wiggles - yellow bows and all. 'I think that Wiggly music is so well known and it's so dancey and catchy that the children - it doesn't really matter who's wearing the skivvies, as long as the music continues on,' Watkins says. Having a girl in the group 'means the world' to the young girls in the audience, Field says. 'They turn up and all they do is look at Emma the whole time,' he says. 'A lot of these 2-year-olds and 3-year-olds have never seen The Wiggles before. This is their first ever Wiggles, so Emma's their superstar.'","In the Crayola-coded Wiggles world, Emma Watkins .

An 18-year-old artist who died after he was Tased by police for spraying graffiti on an abandoned building has been laid to rest in an emotional ceremony in Miami. Jacqueline Llach, the mother of Israel Hernandez-Llach, was seen clasping other family members as she sobbed and followed close behind his casket, which was buried at Vista Memorial Gardens in Miami Lakes on Wednesday. The funeral home donated its services to the grieving family. As around 100 relatives and friends gathered, Hernandez's sister Offir and mother poured sand over the casket as it was lowered to the ground, their faces awash with grief. The cause of the teenager's death has not yet been released by the coroner's office, but at the funeral, the family claimed that the teenager was covered in bruises when he died. Heartbreak: Israel Hernandez-Llach's mother, Jacqueline Llach (holding a flower to her face) sobs as she attends the burial of her son, who died after he was Tased by police last week . This revelation could further fuel . the outrage over how Miami Beach police officers handled Hernandez. Witnesses said that officers high-fived as the youngster lay dying after . he was Tased. 'There . were bad bruises on the body that shows it was more than just a laser,' family spokesperson Fabio Andrade told NBC Miami. Neira Sheffer, a family friend who is a lawyer, added: 'The way the police executed things was not the most appropriate.' Hernandez's . distraught father called for an investigation into what he called an . 'act of barbarism and assassination' as Officer Jorge Mercado, a 13-year . veteran of the force, was placed on paid administrative leave - pending . an investigation - for his involvement. Laid to rest: Pallbearers for the 18-year-old graffiti artist arrive at the service in Miami Lakes on Wednesday . Heartbreak: Family and friends comforted each other at the funeral, held a week after his sudden death . The teenager, an award-winning . artist, was stunned in the chest after officers reportedly caught him . spray-painting the front of a closed McDonald's and gave chase for ten . minutes before catching him. Thiago . Souza, who was with Hernandez-Llach and acting as his lookout, said the . chase began as soon as the officers approached them and told them to . stop. Losing sight of his friend during the chase, Souza caught up to him to find Hernandez-Llach face-down on the sidewalk. 'I . didn’t even know they fired a Taser. I thought they just had him down . and he was arrested and was just tired,’ Souza said to the Miami Herald. 'I couldn’t believe what I was seeing,’ said Souza, 19. 'I asked the cops ‘what happened to my friend?’ Souza then alleges that the police began to make fun of how they caught the teenage artist. Saying goodbye: Jacqueline Llach pours sand on her son's casket during his burial on Wednesday . Farewell: His sister, Offir Hernandez, pours sand onto the boys casket, as outrage swirls around his death . Missed: Nearly 100 friends and relatives came to say goodbye to the talented artist and skateboarder . 'He said, ""You should have seen how . funny it was when his butt clenched when he got Tased"" he said, and they . were all clapping and doing high-fives all over his body. It was almost . like they were proud of what they did.' It was then that they all noticed medics working furiously to revive Hernandez, after he lost consciousness. 'The cop told me he was dead. It was just a powerful image seeing my friend there, with the medics pumping him.’ Miami . Beach Police Chief Raymond Martinez said his department was . investigating the incident and expressed his condolences to the family . of Hernandez, a Colombian immigrant who graduated from high school this . summer. Tragedy: Hernandez was Tased by police after he ran away from them when he was caught spraying graffiti . According to the police report, Hernandez fled after he was confronted by police about 5 a.m. The pursuit ended with Hernandez cornered and, with nowhere to go, he began running toward the officers, Martinez said Wednesday. To avoid physically restraining Hernandez, Officer Jorge Mercado used his Taser. Martinez said after being . stunned, the teenager began showing signs of distress and . paramedics were called . He was transported to Mount Sinai Hospital, . where he was pronounced dead about 6:15 a.m. The boy's family held a press conference with lawyers . at their Miami Beach apartment last week to say they planned to file a . complaint with the FBI or the Florida Department of Law Enforcement . over what they described as excessive use of force by the officers . involved. Bright Future: Hernandez-Llach was an awardñwinning artist known as 'Reefa,' who won acclaim for his graffiti work as well as sculpting and painting, according to The Miami Herald . Missed: Thiago Souza, 19, a friend of Israel Hernandez, shows a sketch that Hernandez drew to members of the media in Miami Beach last week. His friend is pictured with an unidentified woman, right . 'We do not want Miami Beach police . investigating the Miami Beach Police Department. We're calling for an . independent investigation by an outside agency,' said Jose Javier . Rodriguez, an attorney for the family and a Florida state legislator. 'There . is no justification of this kind of action for a second-degree . misdemeanor,' said Jason W. Kreiss, another lawyer representing the . family. Hernandez would likely not have been prosecuted over the spray-painting and would have faced a punishment of community service, he added. Police . in Miami have not made any of the reports of the incident public, but . Officer Thomas Lincoln, who wrote the official incident report said that . he did not see Hernandez shot by the Taser. He said that when he arrived on the scene the teen was 'sitting on the ground and against a wall.'. Martinez said Hernandez-Llach fled after being seen 'vandalizing private property' shortly before dawn on Tuesday.

Tribute: People view the wall where Israel Hernandez-Llach was seen performing graffiti by police in Miami Beach, Florida, August 8th, 2013 . Hernandez, who identified himself by the so-called tag name 'Reefa', was known for his graffiti work as well as for his sculptures and paintings. 'He . did it a lot,' said Hernandez's friend, Rafael Lynch, referring to his . graffiti. 'He wasn't a bad person at all. The cops didn't like him or . what he looked like.' 'In my 20 years as an art teacher, . Israel was one of the most unique and talented students I have ever . encountered,’ added Frank O'Hare, his art teacher at Miami Beach High. Officer Jorge Mercado has a checkered history with the Miami Beach police. According to his internal affairs record, Mercado has had six complaints filed against him ranging from battery to violating the department's code of respect. However, all the complaints were dismissed bar one - a violation of drug testing procedures in January 2011 for which he was suspended for 160 hours.","Israel Hernandez-Llach died after he was Tased by police who caught him spraying graffiti on an abandoned building last week .

They are as British as a stiff upper lip, however knee socks have fallen out of favour with the nation’s men. Generations of boys in short trousers welcomed the warmth and protection of knee-high grey socks during the long winter trudge to school. They were also an essential part of the kit for the nation’s military, whether it was surviving the trenches, negotiating the jungles of Burma or crewing a Royal Navy ship through the South Atlantic. Long woolen socks are a thing of the past. Ankle socks are more popular and fashionable. Debenhams is planning to cut its range of long socks by half due to poor sales . However, today’s molly-coddled youth and young men, now mostly rely on the flimsy, throw-away white socks worn with designer trainers. Many a fashionable young man will now go without socks completely, apparently happy to show a bit of bare ankle above a smart pair of brogues. The office uniform for most white collar workers is a pair or dark – black, blue or grey - ankle socks . Debenhams said it plans to halve its range of knee length socks this Autumn after seeing a 74per cent slump in sales over the past two years. Spokesman Ed Watson said: ‘A garment which once symbolised Britain’s imperial might is marching into history, bringing an end to a century long role of traditional male dress. ‘Instead, modern men are opting for ankle socks, ultra short sport socks, or in high fashion circles; no socks at all.’ He complained: ‘The common phrase ‘pull your socks up’ could mean nothing to future generations. Knee length socks once conquered an empire, but now they seem to be fading into history.’ The 11th Duke of Argyll shows how long socks were worn in a time when to 'pull your socks up' had real meaning . Long woollen knee high socks were once standard issue for both the British army and the navy. They were regarded as essential to protect soldiers in the trenches, helping to prevent foot rot which maimed so many troops during World War One. Officers had socks made of a softer, finer weave, while other ranks made do with coarser material. Thousands of women across the country knitted long socks to send to the troops during both world wars. So vital a part of life were they, that the Imperial War Museum still has a collection of knee high socks worn by British military personnel throughout various campaigns. Cold weather was by no means the only reason to wear them, for long socks were worn with shorts by the British army in tropical climates, such as India and Burma. Many former British overseas territories continue to wear the style today - police in Bermuda still wear long socks as part of their regular summer uniform. The practice of wearing long socks continued into British civilian life when millions of troops were demobilised after World War II. Many were worn with discreet calf garters to prevent them from slipping down the leg. However, Debenhams said the introduction of central heating and the more comfortable lifestyles of modern Britain mean demand for knee-high socks has been in decline since the 1960s. It said the desire of a new generation to be different from their parents in the 1970s and 1980s saw the sock fall further in popularity. The store said that modern lightweight shoes have also made wearing thick woollen socks impractical and uncomfortable. Mr Watson said: ‘While there are still some men who refuse to part with tradition, knee high socks are now worn primarily by school children and Swiss yodelling champions. ‘It’s a shame because these socks served the country well when Britain was on its back foot. Now it seems that we have become a nation, quite literally, in danger of losing its sole.’","Long woolen socks were once standard issue for the British army and navy .

"By . Olivia Williams . PUBLISHED: . 09:27 EST, 15 August 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 09:49 EST, 15 August 2013 . China is phasing out its controversial practice of taking organs from executed prisoners for use in transplant operations. China is the only country in the world that still systematically removes organs taken from dead death row prisoners, a practice that has drawn international criticism. Many Chinese view the practice as a way for criminals to redeem themselves. Organ shortage: Voluntary donations will make it possible for hospitals to no longer rely on death-row prisoners for transplants . However, officials have recently spoken out against the practice, saying it 'tarnishes the image of China' and that they will push for more ethical ways to harvest organs. The health ministry will begin using only organs from voluntary donors after a meeting in November, former deputy health minister Huang Jiefu announced. 'I am confident that before long all accredited hospitals will forfeit the use of prisoner organs,' Huang said. An Australian-trained liver transplant . surgeon, Huang said the China Organ Transplant Committee will ensure . that the 'source of the organs for transplantation must meet the . commonly accepted ethical standards in the world'. The first batch of all 165 Chinese hospitals licensed for transplants will promise to stop using organs harvested from death row inmates at the November meeting, he added. Long waiting lists: It has been very difficult to get a transplant in China for decades as in Chinese culture people are buried with all their organs in tact . Supply falls far short of demand . due in part to the traditional Chinese belief that bodies should be . buried or cremated intact. China has now launched pilot volunteer organ donor programmes in 25 provinces and municipalities with the aim of creating a nationwide voluntary scheme by the end of 2013. By the end of 2012, about 64 percent of transplanted organs in China came from executed prisoners and the number has dipped to under 54 percent so far this year, according to figures provided by Huang. At a meeting in August last year, Huang told officials that top leaders had decided to reduce dependency on prisoners' organs. Rights groups say many organs are taken from prisoners without their consent or their family's knowledge, something the government denies. So far, more than 1,000 organ donors have come through the new system, benefiting at least 3,000 patients, Huang said. Widespread criticism: China is currently the only country in the world to systematically remove the organs of its executed prisoners . Voluntary organ donation in China has already risen from 63 cases in all of 2010 to a current average of 130 per month so far this year, Huang added. However, not all donated organs are currently allocated through the new programme, leaving room for human interference, one of the main challenges the reform faces. An estimated 300,000 patients are put on a waiting list every year for organ transplants and only about one in 30 ultimately will receive a transplant. The shortage has driven a trade in illegal organ trafficking and in 2007 the government banned organ transplants from living donors, except spouses, blood relatives and step or adopted family members.","China is the only country in the .

A team of tricksters raked in thousands of pounds by overcharging a pensioner for odd jobs and gardening. Edward Dolan and his teenage son, Michael, were both jailed today for the scam, in which they charged their 84-year-old victim up to £1,250 a time for small, substandard jobs. The ruthless travelling gang's activities did not come to light until after the cancer sufferer, from Marske, east Cleveland, died in late 2011. Jailed: A team of tricksters raked in thousands of pounds by overcharging a pensioner for odd jobs and gardening. Edward Dolan, left, and his teenage son Michael ,right, have today been jailed . Over more than two years, they took a total of £17,500. One entry in the OAP's chequebook was £700 for a coat of gloss on a garage door, while there were also payments for house repairs and cleaning. The pair, both from Stokesley, North Yorkshire, were jailed after they pleaded guilty to conspiracy to defraud and money laundering. The scam came to light following the pensioner's death. The day after he died, his son was sorting through his belongings when Edward Dolan turned up at the house looking to make more money. Prosecutor Richard Bennett told Teesside Crown Court that the 47-year-old 'left in a hurry' when he was told of the pensioner passing away. But the victim's son was easily able to describe the 31-stone conman, while neighbours of the OAP later told police they had seen him there regularly. Convicted: Michael Dolan also admitted a second conspiracy with friend William McElvaney, pictured, both now 19, which involved fleecing an 89-year-old out of £180 . Michael Dolan, who was 15 when the scam started, claimed after his arrest the gardening and repair business was his, and his father was just his driver. His father tried to shift the blame onto the teenager when quizzed - but trading standards chiefs believe he ran it until his son reached 18. Michael Dolan also admitted a second conspiracy with friend William McElvaney, both now 19, which involved fleecing an 89-year-old out of £180. The woman, who suffered from dementia and lived alone like the first victim, twice called her son to say she had no money after the pair took her pension. Mr Bennett said a diary entry she made said 'gardeners have been to cut the edges' and she later told her son that they had taken all of her cash. Because she had been tricked out of money earlier in the year, her family installed a security camera which caught the pair knocking at her door. The following day, Dolan returned to the bungalow in Hutton Rudby, North Yorkshire, looking for further work and cash for 'work', said Mr Bennett. McElvaney, of  Whitby, was locked up for nine months after he admitted conspiracy to defraud over two days with Michael Dolan. His barrister, John Harrison, admitted the pair did not intend to finish the job for which they had been paid, but said his involvement was limited. Nigel Edwards, for Michael Dolan, who was jailed for two years, said the teenager accepted he overcharged for work but had no real empathy or insight. Emma Bennett, for Edward Dolan, jailed for 15 months, said his asthma, obesity and knee and toe pains, would make any prison sentence hard to cope with. Judge Armstrong heard that building and gardening experts said the £17,500 work on the home of the first victim was worth no more than £1,800.","Edward Dolan and his teenage son .

The lawyer for one of the two 18-year-olds charged with circulating rape pictures of a teenage girl who later hanged herself says his client is being persecuted by a 'cyber-lynch mob.' The tragic suicide in April of Rehtaeh Parsons, a 17-year-old high school student from Nova Scotia, Canada, brought international attention to her claims that she was gang-raped when she was 15 and then relentlessly tormented by classmates who called her a 'slut' and harassed her for sex. Much of the bullying was a result of a photo the circulated at her school that showed Parsons being assaulted by a teen boy while throwing up out a window. The two 18-year-olds are charged with child pornography. One is accused of taking the picture, both are accused of circulating it. Because the alleged crime took place when the men were 16, they are charged as juveniles and their identities cannot be revealed. 'Victim': She was labelled a 'slut' after she was allegedly gang raped by four teenagers in 2010 . Protection: The two teenage suspects, now 18, cannot be identified under Canadian law because they were 16 when the alleged crime took place . They were both in court today with their parents for a brief appearance. The judge set a trial for September 19. Josh Arnold, the attorney for one of the men, told CTV News that his client has already been convicted in the court of public opinion. 'The Internet mavens and some members of the media have acted like a lynch mob in relation to this matter. They've tried and convicted this person without any due process whatsoever,' he said. Rehtaeh's heartbroken parents say that she hanged herself in their bathroom two years after the alleged attack because she could not bear to bullying and torment at school. Her uncle was furious about the attorney's allegations. 'This man's saying that these boys have been prosecuted in the media.That hasn't been the case. That's not true,' Michael Parsons said. A handful of protestors turned out to the courthouse where the suspects in the Rehtaeh case were due to appear . 'This case has been brought forward in the media. Because, it was only through the media participation that this case is even being looked at today.' He also said he is praying for the two accused. 'I have to pray for these boys. I have to pray for them to become good men. That's the hardest thing for me to do. But it's something I have to do. That's what's hard. If you want to know the truth that's the hardest thing to do,' he told the CBC. 'I have absolutely no faith in the RCMP or the Halifax city police or the Crown prosecutors because they totally dropped this case, they totally dropped the ball.' Retaeh's death led to an outcry because no one was charged or even reprimanded at the school - either for her rape or for the bullying. Tragedy: Rehtaeh Parsons, 17, took her life in April after enduring months of bullying after an alleged gang rape . Four boys, aged 14, 17 and two aged . 16, allegedly took it in turns to sexually assault her on November 12, 2011, after plying her with . alcohol, she told her mother days after. Her . mother said she saw an image of the alleged attack which showed her . daughter being raped by a teenage boy as he gave a 'thumbs up' sign while she vomited out of a window. Police initially concluded there were no grounds to charge anyone after a year-long investigation. Royal Canadian Mounted Police Cpl Scott MacRae said they arrested two . males today. Investigators said they are being questioned and no . further information will be released at this time. 'Due to the sensitive nature around this investigation, the . investigators do want to ensure that no court process is affected,' MacRae said. The arrests came after someone came . forward in April and provided new information and said they were willing . to verify who the suspects are. 'We're just hopeful there's charges laid and others to arrest, hoping . that they're finally willing to tell their side of the story,' Leah . Parsons, Rehtaeh's mother, said. Innocence: Rehtaeh is pictured as a baby with her parents, Leah Parsons and Clen Canning . Distraught: Rehtaeh's mother chokes back tears at the teenager's funeral in April after she hanged herself . 'A sense of relief came over me that at least they're going to be questioned.' Last month Leah and her husband spoke to People magazine about their daughter's tragic death. 'When Rehtaeh was born, I promised her the world. Now my beautiful girl is gone,' Leah said. She started smoking pot to 'numb her emotions' and deal with Facebook messages and texts that came through by the dozen. They read things like: 'Sluts are not welcome here' and 'everyone knew exactly what you have done'. Rehtaeh . eventually closed down her Facebook page because there were so many men . asking her to have sex with them. They would say: ‘You had sex with my . friend, so why not me?’ The response from the school was, apparently, to do very little. Halifax school board spokesman Doug Hadley has said that none of the boys were spoken to. Her father, Glen Canning, told People: 'My . daughter wasn't bullied to death, she was disappointed to death. Disappointed in people she thought she could trust, her school, and the . police.' Left behind: Her father said she killed herself out of disappointment in her . school, her former friends and law enforcement officers who failed to . help her . Rehtaeh's death prompted the Nova Scotia government to launch reviews of . the RCMP's original investigation and the school board's handling of . the matter. An . independent review released in June concluded the Halifax Regional . School Board could have done a better job, but it was hindered by the . fact that Rehtaeh was often absent from class.

Reginald Warneford who became a national hero when he single-handedly destroyed a Zeppelin has been left off a commemorative list because he was born in India . A national hero fighter pilot who was the first person to shoot down a Zeppelin will be left off a roll call of First World War Victoria Cross heroes because he was born in India. Sub-Lieutenant Reginald 'Rex' Warneford was awarded the medal for outstanding valour when he was just 23 for the mission. Under government rules he will be excluded from a poignant commemoration next year to mark the 100th anniversary of the start of World War I. His solo mission was celebrated nationally and the country also fell into mourning when he was tragically killed two weeks later. Despite the accolade, his name will not appear on commemorative stone slabs to be laid next year because the government ruled that only servicemen and women born in Britain are eligible. Local politicians, historians and military campaigners have criticised the decision to exclude Sub-Lt Warneford, who moved to Exmouth in Devon when he was a boy. Armed forced campaigner Lionel Howell, 74, has called for Mr Warneford's name to join that of Exmouth's only other VC winner, Lt Richard Sandford. He said: 'It's disgusting to even think about leaving Rex out. 'He fought for his country; it shouldn't matter where he was born. 'If they are going to leave Rex out, they should scrub the whole thing.' Mayor of Exmouth John Humphreys said the airman had made the town his home. Mr Humphreys said: 'It's perverse that some bureaucrat has made a decision to exclude him from being recognised in his home town.' Barbara Gilbert, archivist for the Fleet Air Arm Museum where Rex's VC is held, said: 'It is very saddening to learn of official discrimination against those born overseas. 'This means that no town in the UK can claim Rex Warneford as their own.' She said eastern England had 'lived in fear' of the devastating Zeppelin bombing raids. 'Overnight, Warneford became a national hero and gave us hope,' said Mrs Gilbert. 'Killed in a crash only two weeks later, his death led to national mourning. 'Some 99 years on, it is fitting that we should remember him.' Sub-Lt Warneford was born on October 15, 1891, in Darjeeling in the foothills of the Himalayas, where his parents served in the colonial service at the height of the British Empire. An artist's impression of the daring Zeppelin raid which was celebrated nationally and earned Warneford the Victoria Cross and France's Legion of Honour . They moved back to Exmouth and Rex . joined the Royal Naval Air Service - the forerunner of the Navy's Fleet . Air Arm - when war erupted in August 1914. The Government plan to commemorate every British-born Great War VC winner . He . had completed a dozen solo flights when on June 7, 1915, he was ordered . to join a four-plane midnight attack on the Zeppelin sheds at Bercham . in occupied Belgium. Sub Lt Warneford had never flown in the dark before and quickly lost his fellow pilots. Flying a tiny single-seater Morane Parasol, mostly made from just wood and canvas, he came across airship LZ-37 airship cruising at 7,000ft. The massive bomber was kept airborne by 953,000 cubic feet of highly flammable hydrogen. Rex was armed with just a revolver, carbine, and six 20-pound bombs. He spotted the airship at Ostend and he followed it for 50 minutes over Bruges before Warneford shot at it. After the Zeppelin dropped to 7,000ft, Warneford was able to climb above it and dropped his bombs, which ripped the airship apart. Warneford's plane was enveloped in flames and he crash-landed 35 miles behind German lines. He found only his fuel line was broken and fixed the problem with a cigarette holder before coolly flying home. By the time he returned to base at 10.30am the next day, his exploits were being celebrated across the empire. King George V awarded Rex the Victoria Cross that day, while France followed up with its prestigious Legion of Honour. He won worldwide fame for becoming the first pilot to shoot down a feared Zeppelin. But he was killed 10 days later after he returned from France after collecting the award in a new biplane that bucked moments after take-off and the pilot was thrown out and killed. A Department for Communities and Local Government spokesman said: 'The men who gave their lives in the Great War will remain heroes forever. The Government will be setting out more of its plan to commemorate the 100th anniversary shortly. This will include the most appropriate way to commemorate Commonwealth Victoria Cross winners. No hero will be forgotten.'","Sub-Lieutenant Reginald Warneford, from Exmouth, was born in India .

'I don't think body image will take over at . all,' explains Gillian. 'Generally speaking. she's always attracted stares, so at 14 she's . used to that. 'She's obviously delighted she's turning into a young . woman but she's already had to come to terms with her body.' For Gillian herself, tackling her teenage years was made easy by her supportive parents. 'I was just in a very positive . environment and never let my height stop me. 'I've fulfilled everything I . wanted to do. The only big issue was getting a boyfriend at peer age. That was . the biggest, no, only drawback.' Like others with achondroplasia, a genetic disorder that affects bone growth, Gillian has a normal sized trunk but drastically shortened legs. As a result, getting around requires much forward-planning, but this notwithstanding, emphasises Gillian, she and her family are totally normal. Gillian believes that some famous dwarves use their disorder as currency, but rates actor Peter Dinklage: 'He's a man who happens to be a dwarf. If Sophie ever wanted to go into acting, he'd be the one I'd tell her to look at.' Normal: Gillian hopes the documentary will show viewers that small people are just like everyone else . Couple: Ben and Rebecca Taylor also feature in My Dwarf Family and hope to have children one day . 'I wanted people to see a different representation of a small family on television,' she explains. 'The programme offers different perspectives [on living with achondroplasia]. 'Other programmes showing small families have been quite negative but I wanted to show that we're just normal people with normal difficulties. 'We raise our daughter telling her she can be whatever she wants to be just like everyone else.' One such negative representation comes, thinks Gillian, from performers such as Warwick Davis who are all too ready to make comic currency from their condition. 'A few years ago, he [Warwick Davis] appeared at a comedy awards show with Dara Ó Briain, sitting on his shoulder. 'I just thought no ... little boys sit on people's shoulders and he's a grown man. He's showing people that he's happy to be treated as a child and I just think that's not the right message. 'I've got nothing against the guy - he has a career and is trying to do a lot for . awareness - but you have to think about whole TV audience. We need to get rid of the idea that dwarves are there to be laughed at.' One actor who does meet with her approval is Game of Thrones' Peter Dinklage, who plays the scheming Tyrion Lannister. 'He's a dwarf character but that's not the point of the role,' she explains. 'He's a man who happens to be a dwarf. If Sophie ever wanted to go into acting, he [Dinklage] would be the one I'd tell her to look at.' Whatever career Sophie eventually chooses, her 'no-nonsense' mother will be right behind her. At the moment though, she's got more immediate matters on her mind. 'I hope people will realise that it's about getting to . know the person rather than the difference,' she says of tonight's documentary. 'One of the beautiful things about my relationship with Stephen is that height has never been an issue. He fell in love with me for me. 'Apart from practical difficulties, we're just normal people who do normal things.' My Dwarf Family is on ITV1 tonight at 9pm.

Pervert: Jeffrey Howard Davies worked for South Wales Police when he touched a distressed woman and tried to get another to touch his groin . A police officer who preyed on two domestic violence victims to get his sexual kicks has been jailed for three years. Detective Jeffrey Howard Davies was a family liaison officer with South Wales Police when he touched a distressed woman and tried to get another to touch his groin. The women say they now live in fear of the police - with one suffering panic attacks following her ordeal. During his two-week trial, the court heard that Davies was supposed to help victims of domestic violence. He had been with the force since 2000. He vehemently denied the two counts of sexual assault, both in 2010, calling the allegations 'nonsense'. But the prosecution said he abused his position of authority to try to persuade his victims to have sex with him. In the first attack, he rubbed the leg of a woman who had complained of domestic abuse while the two were travelling in a car discussing the case. A victim impact statement read aloud by prosecutor John Hipkin said the woman had found it difficult to come to terms with what had happened. She said: 'What this man has done to me has traumatised me psychologically. 'I now panic if I see a male police officer in the street. I have even had to change doctors because I found out that my GP works at the police station. 'I always thought of myself as a strong person, but what this man did to me has shattered my confidence.' The woman also said she felt embarrassed and that no one would believe her. In the second attack, Davies forced a woman's hand against his groin after he interviewed her, before asking her for oral sex. She too had come to him for help after suffering domestic abuse. The judge at Swansea Crown Court said a long prison sentence for the detective must follow . In her statement the woman said: 'I was angry and shocked after it happened. 'I did not think anybody would believe me because he was a policeman.I do not trust the police as fully as I used to. 'I've started having panic attacks again - I haven't had them in four years.' Defending barrister Lucy Crowther said her client had accepted there was limited mitigation that could be made given his not guilty plea, which a judge said had put the victims through even more stress. She had tried to argue that, in some respects, the extent of Davies' sexual relations had not been as serious as two police officers who had been convicted of having sex while on duty. Pervert: Jeffrey Howard Davies worked for South Wales Police when he touched a distressed woman and tried to get another to touch his groin . Former Greater Manchester Police officer Michael Fletcher was jailed for 32 months in 2011 after having penetrative sex with a vulnerable adult while on duty. And ex-Avon and Somerset Officer Kenny Lewis, 26, was jailed for four years in 2009 after engaging in sexual activity with a number of 'vulnerable' women, also while on duty. Ms Crowther asked the court to impose a sentence nearer the sentencing guidelines for an offence of sexual touching - which has a lower starting point. However, while Judge Paul Thomas acknowledged that Davies had not engaged in 'more intimate' sexual activity, he argued there was a key difference in the case. 'The sentencing guidelines, if you excuse my inelegant phrase, fly straight out of the window,' he said. He pointed out that the sexual activity engaged in by Davies, although of a less serious nature than in the Fletcher and Lewis cases, had no consent whatsoever. He added: 'A long prison sentence must follow.' As well as imposing a three-year custodial term, Davies was placed on the sex offenders register indefinitely. Wearing a blue and red checked shirt and trousers, he bowed his head in shame as he was taken down by two security guards. Throughout the hearing, the disgraced officer could also not bring himself to look towards the public gallery where several of his former colleagues sat. South Wales Police's Assistant Chief Constable Richard Lewis said now that sentence had been passed, gross misconduct proceedings against Davies would be taken forward. He added: 'His actions were a gross abuse of position and power which will not be tolerated within policing. 'The thorough and determined investigation carried out by South Wales Police and managed by the IPCC, demonstrates our determination to tackle behaviour of this kind.'","Detective Jeffrey Howard Davies was family liaison officer with South Wales Police .

This is the horrific moment a bouncer punched a man outside a bar causing permanent brain damage that led to his death. Scott Sheard, 24, was struck by doorman Stuart Humphreys outside Destination Bar in Southport, Merseyside. Mr Sheard immediately dropped to the floor and lay motionless on the pavement. He died in hospital two years later. Scroll down for video . Horrific: This CCTV footage shows the moment a bouncer punched Scott Sheard outside a bar. He later died after suffering permanent brain damage . Powerful: Doorman Stuart Humphreys punched Mr Sheard outside Destination Bar in Southport, Merseyside . Injured: The 24-year-old lies motionless on the ground as the violence threatens to spill out of control. He suffered permanent brain damage . Mr Humphreys told police he slapped Mr Sheard across the face because he feared the Formby man was about to punch him. This CCTV footage has now been released by Mr Sheard's mother Fenella and step-dad Colin Hill who are furious that no action has been taken against the doorman. Mr Hill, from Formby, said 'The slap claim was ridiculous. The CCTV footage showed a punch, although if you blink you miss it. 'The consultant told us that Scott . was unconscious before his head hit the pavement. And an independent . eyewitness told the police that the blow was like a boxer’s punch due to . its speed. 'During the inquest Mr Humphreys said . he only wanted to knock Scott off balance. I have seen the CCTV and . would question whether that was the action of a man trying to knock . Scott off balance.' The trouble flared when Mr Sheard was pushed as left the bar in October 2009.

After he is knocked to the floor, the . CCTV footage shows Mr Humphreys appear to briefly square up to one of . his friends as the violence threatens to spiral out of control. The group of friends then shout at the doorman for striking Mr Sheard and point towards the CCTV camera above them. At the inquest into Mr Sheard's death, the coroner said he accepted Mr Humphreys . had acted in self-defence, believing he was about to be assaulted. The Crown Prosecution Service has also said that Mr Humphreys’ claim of self-defence could not be disproved in court. The film also captured the aftermath of the attack, as Mr Sheard's friends cradled him in their arms and members of the public stopped to help before paramedics arrived. Doctors told Mr Sheard's family that he suffered brain damage both from the punch and from the impact of his head hitting the pavement. He died of septicaemia in January 2012 after being left unable to walk, talk or feed himself. He was 27. Mr Sheard's mother always hoped her son would be able to come home one day so she could look after him. Since her son’s death, she has urged city clubbers and drinkers to show restraint after witnessing at first hand the damage that just ‘one punch’ can do.","Scott Sheard was struck by doorman Stuart Humphreys .

"By . Daily Mail Reporter . PUBLISHED: . 20:25 EST, 2 July 2013 . | . UPDATED: . 20:49 EST, 2 July 2013 . Elaine Silets is a train lover like no other. Not only did she make a career out of building model train displays but her expansive estate is an homage to the locomotive. And over the weekend, Silets did something she does but once per year: she opened up her gardens to the public and something like 6,000 curious train lovers descended on her home. With10 acres of gardens, waterfalls, lakes, trestles, bridges, and replica towns and pastoral scenes, her Glorée & Tryumfant Garden Railway in North Barrington, Illinois, it’s no wonder they call her the Train Lady. Elaborate: About 6,000 visitors got a chance to view Elaine Silets' elaborate, train display-covered estate outside Chicago Saturday . Silets began her new life as the Train Lady after her beloved late husband Harvey’s law career took off, leaving her in search of a hobby. That hobby became Huff & Puff Industries, a company that designs and manufactures model railroads for home and garden displays. Huff & Puff’s work has been seen in the Nieman Marcus Christmas book, in the lobby of Chicago’s Hancock Center, and in Tiffany & Co. window displays. Serious business: Silets (pictured) turned a love of trains into a famous business that creates high-end train displays, one of which even appeared in Chicago's Hancock Center lobby . Expansive: The ten acre Glorée & Tryumfant Garden Railway features Japanese gardens, waterways, topiaries, and seemingly endless displays, all with model trains chugging through year round . Intricate: Miniature people even populate the model train worlds . But Silets’ biggest accomplishment is her own garden display. Eleven model trains chug about the lavish gardens all-year round. The half-inch G-scale trains ply a Japanese water garden with waterfalls, a pond garden, rose gardens, a Snoopy topiary built especially for Silets’ grandsons, and other floral landscapes. Also open to the day’s visitors was the private train museum on Silets’ propertyThe Harvey M. Silets Memorial museum was . built in honor of the Train Lady’s husband, a famous attorney who once . represented Jimmy Hoffa. The museum is a scaled down replica of Greater . Chicago that has 16 trains of its own, a drive-in movie theatre, and . other transit-related exhibits like elevated trains and subway trains. 'I live in heaven': A train traverses a Japanese waterscape in Silets' expansive gardens that she calls heaven . Durable: There are many water features in Silets' gardens. The trains that chug over and around them run all year round . Down to business: Though Silets (left) has plenty of personal passion for her trains, they are also her business. Huff & Puff Industries (right) creations have appeared in Chicago's Hnacock Center, Tiffany's window displays, and on the Oprah Winfrey Show, The Today Show, NBC, CNN, CBS, FOX, NBC, the Travel Channel, and PBS . Choo-choo: Silets preoccupation, before it was an occupation, began when her husband's law career took off, leaving her with time on her hands . For visitors, the once a year opportunity was well worth the $10 entrance fee. ‘It was fun,’ young Ethan Sparks told the Barrington Courier-Review as he reluctantly stepped off a replica Hogwarts Express train, inspired by the Harry Potter film and book series . Visitors continually thanked Silets for inviting the public onto her estate. ‘I always feel like Queen Elizabeth for a day,’ Silets said. She even offered tips on how to create one’s own Glorée & Tryumfant Garden. In Memoriam: Elaine Silets, known as the Train Lady, maintains her huge, locomotive gardens in part as a memorial to her late husband Harvey, a lawyer who once defended Jimmy Hoffa . High flying: Like the bustling metropolis of Chicago, which is close by, Silets' garden has elevated trains as well as purely terrestrial ones . ‘I tell everyone it’s real easy,’ she said. ‘All you need is to live here 40-plus years, and buckets of money.’ ‘I’ve lived here 44 years now,’ Silets clarified. ‘There was almost nothing here — the pond was here and a shabby, 1,000-square-foot house.’ And no matter how much her home and gardens are appreciated by visitors, Silets seems to love it all the most. ‘I live in heaven,' she said. 'I do. Isn’t it beautiful?' Proceeds from Saturday’s event will go toward providing scholarships to promising artists who hope to attend the prestigious Interlochen Summer Arts Camp in Michigan, of which Silets is an alum, but who don’t have the financial ability.","Elaine Silets opens her renowned North Barrington, Illinois estate for public viewing just once per year .

An analysis of angry comments on Twitter by rail passengers has suggested the least popular train company in Britain was South West Trains. The train company had the largest percentage of outright complaints in tweets by its customers, according to a survey of 92,000 messages by social media monitoring company Brandwatch. SWT, which operates trains from London’s Waterloo station to Surrey, Hampshire and Dorset, attracted 44 per cent of all the tweets included in the study. A study of angry comments by rail passengers on Twitter has suggested South West Trains is the least popular train company in Britain . A total of 36 per cent of the SWT tweets were outright complaints. According to the study, First Great Western was the next least popular company, followed by Southeastern. The company with the most positive tweets was East Coast. Overall, 29,000 tweets were negative, with only five per cent being positive. According to the study, the top five complaints were late-running trains, no air conditioning, broken down trains, being late for work and the rush-hour crush. Joel Windels, lead community manager for Brandwatch said: 'It’s no surprise that people love to moan about public transport in Britain. It’s up there with the weather as one of the things we like to grumble about most. The study, by social media monitoring company Brandwatch, suggestedSouth West Trains had the largest percentage of outright complaints in tweets by its customers . 'However, it’s interesting to look at more specific issues that are causing these complaints, and how these differ between each operator. It may be unfair to label all train companies as woefully unhelpful, but by benchmarking each against its competitors, we can see which ones are managing to pacify commuters most.' A spokesperson for the South West Trains-Network Rail Alliance said: 'We run the busiest franchise in the UK and one of the busiest train companies in Europe, carrying almost 210 million passengers a year. The volume and amount of communication from our customers reflects that. 'We are already responding to many of the issues raised by our passengers - such as overcrowding, disruption and information provision - with hundreds of millions of pounds of investment in extra train carriages, infrastructure improvements and customer communications. 'Passenger satisfaction remains at a high level and figures for 2012-13 published by the Office of Rail Regulation show that SWT has the fourth lowest complaint rate of the 19 franchised train companies in the UK. 'It is impossible to compare the performance of companies which have a largely long-distance leisure customer base with those which have a high proportion of commuters.' According to the study, the top five complaints were late-running trains, no air conditioning, broken down trains, being late for work and the rush-hour crush .","South West Trains had largest percentage of complaints in tweets .
