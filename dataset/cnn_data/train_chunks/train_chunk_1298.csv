"Chris Tarrant has told how he desperately tried to phone his girlfriend to say goodbye after suffering a stroke flying at 39,000ft. The former Who Wants to be a Millionaire? host became convinced he was going to die after suddenly losing the use of his arms and legs on a flight from Thailand to London. He said he battled the symptoms for 11 traumatic hours but didn't want to tell the cabin crew as he was afraid they would say there was nothing they could do. TV presenter Chris Tarrant today told how he feared he would die on board a flight from Bangkok to Heathrow after suffering a stroke at 39,000ft . The 67-year-old host had flown to Thailand to film Chris Tarrant: Extreme Railways (pictured). For 11 hours on board the flight he battled his symptoms, collapsing as he reached passport control at Heathrow . Andrew Marr unknowingly had two mini strokes before his third, near-fatal stroke last year, his wife has revealed. Jackie Ashley said the BBC presenter, 54, was one of around 46,000 people a year who have a TIA, a transient ischaemic attack. In one instance he slurred his words, in the other he blacked out briefly. He dismissed them as 'funny turns' but had he recognised the symptoms he might never have had the third stroke which left him with impaired mobility down his left side, said Miss Ashley, who is backing a Stroke Association campaign to raise awareness of TIAs. Instead, he kept calling his long-term . girlfriend Jane Bird, 51, to tell her he loved her. He said: 'I got . very panicky. I was very alone up there, thinking, “I could die”. 'I . wasn't sure if I was going to fade away completely on my own. I am . incredibly lucky to be alive because one in three people who have . strokes don't make it. It has made me appreciate my life so much more.' Tarrant, . 67, had travelled to Thailand to film the second series of his Extreme . Railways documentaries and said the symptoms started at the airport in . Bangkok as he waited for his return flight on March 1. 'In . the airport I started feeling this pain in my hand,' he said. 'I looked . down and just slid off my seat. I was embarrassed more than anything. I . thought it was cramp. 'But . about an hour into the 12-hour flight I suddenly realised I couldn't . lift my arm and my leg felt funny. I remembered the advert that helps . you look out for the signs of a stroke. I tried three times to use the . satellite phone on the plane to call Jane to tell her I wasn't well but . it wouldn't work. I felt very alone. It was the longest flight of my . life. I thought that could be it for me. 'I . thought about telling the crew but they were Thai and didn't speak very . good English. I thought, “What are they going to do? We're in mid-air”. It sounds daft but I guess I didn't want to find out the answer was . there was nothing they could do. Chris tried to call his girlfriend Jane Bird using the satellite phone, fearing he would not make it home alive . 'The side of my body went numb. I became more and more frightened – then the realisation hit that it was a stroke.' He . said when the plane landed he tried to drag himself to passport control . to ask for help but keeled over. A couple who had been on the same . flight came to his rescue and called an ambulance. He said he is keen to track them down to thank them, adding: 'What they did for me was amazing.' He was taken to Charing Cross Hospital and had surgery to remove the blood clot causing a temporary loss of blood to his brain. He . spent two weeks in hospital but two months on, he has still not . regained total control of his speech or movement. The father of six and . grandfather of three was married twice before meeting his girlfriend, . who is a legal assistant, in 2007. He . told the Sun on Sunday she has been his 'rock' and hinted they may now . marry. He added: 'The stroke has been one hell of a warning. 'I . have cut out the spirits and only drink wine in moderation now. Jane is . helping me stay on the straight and narrow. The doctors told me I had . been very lucky. There was a chance I was going to be wheelchair-bound.' He . said he now has a different outlook on life. 'I'm in no rush to get . back into TV. Time is precious and spending time with family is more . important than work.' Stroke is a 'brain attack', according to the Stroke Association. Its . website says: 'For your brain to function, it needs a constant blood . supply, which provides vital nutrients and oxygen to the brain cells. A . stroke happens when the blood supply to part of the brain is cut off and . brain cells are damaged or die. 'About . a third of people who have a stroke make a significant recovery within a . month. But most stroke survivors will have long-term problems. It may . take a year or longer for them to make the best possible recovery. Sadly, in the most severe cases, strokes can be fatal or cause long-term . disability.' It says that members of the public can recognise a stroke using the FAST test: . 1) Facial weakness - can the person smile? Has their mouth or eye drooped?2) Arm weakness - Can the person raise both arms?3) Speech problems - Can the person speak clearly and understand what you say?4) Time to call 999. The Stroke Association says that failing any of these tests means it's a medical emergency and it's time to call 999.","Chris Tarrant suffered a stroke on board a flight from Bangkok to Heathrow .

"Former Manchester United defender Rio Ferdinand has praised Roy Keane's influence on him at Old Trafford, even though he thought the Irishman was 'nuts' during one of his first training sessions. Ferdinand joined the Red Devils from Leeds in 2002 and spent over three years playing alongside Keane, winning the Premier League title in his first season with the club.

And I stood there and thought ""This guy is crazy, man, I passed it to a team-mate.""' Despite his initial shock at Keane's reaction, the 35-year-old quickly realised that his new team-mate was only trying to help him get into the mindset of a United player. He added: 'I went home and thought 'This guy is nuts, how am I going to deal with him on a daily basis.' But then I realised what he said, you've got to start taking risks. He was aggressive in that sense, but I liked that stuff.' Keane and Ferdinand celebrate together after a goal from Ruud van Nistelrooy against Lyon in November 2004 .

"Chris Eubank Jnr must ditch his famous father from his training set-up if he is to realise his potential, according to promoter Frank Warren. Eubank suffered his first career defeat last weekend against British, Commonwealth and European middleweight Billy Joe Saunders. And while Warren believes the 25-year-old has a bright future but is being hindered by his dad's influence. Chris Eubank Jnr looks disconsolate with his father after losing to Billy Joe Saunders last Saturday . Eubank Snr poses during rounds as Chris Jnr's trainer talks to him from outside the ropes . Eubank Snr has consistently overshadowed his son in the build-up to his fights . Writing in his Independent column, he said: 'The boy is a terrific talent but in boxing terms needs to grow into a man – his own man. By that I mean he must step out of the all-enveloping shadow of his father, a great world champion he so closely resembles in his style, stance and mannerisms. 'He also has his dad’s arrogance, his heart and his bottle. But he hasn’t yet got Chris Snr’s skills and strategical nous. And I am not sure that Brighton’s erstwhile Lord of the Manor is the one to impart them. 'That job is best left to the man who has trained them both. Yet on Saturday night, Ronnie Davies, though nominally chief second, was virtually a bystander as posing pater, eccentrically clad as always and looking more like a character out of Tatler than a working cornerman, hovered around them. 'I really don’t get this dad thing – and I doubt the son needs it. The bottom 'line is that a boxer only requires one person in the corner giving instructions, and that is the one who works with him on a daily basis: the trainer, the one who is reading the fight. The Eubanks have got to sort out their relationship. At the moment the Eubank show seems more about Chris Snr than Jnr.'

"Vinnie Jones has revealed how Crazy Gang pal John Fashanu savagely beat up a Wimbledon team-mate by throwing him around the dressing-room and smashing him against the floor. It is one of several stunning confessions from a television documentary about the Crazy Gang that charts the club’s incredible climb in the 1980s from the lower divisions to winning the FA Cup final at Wembley. In the programme, which will be screened on BT Sport on Boxing Day, it is revealed: . John Fashanu (centre) and Vinnie Jones (right) were central figures in Wimbledon's Crazy Gang . Dave Beasant holds the FA Cup on manager Bobby Gould's head after their fairytale victory in 1988 . The Wimbeldon team following their victory over Liverpool at Wembley . Lawrie Sanchez (second right) headed the only goal of the game as Wimbledon beat the mighty Liverpool . Several former players including Fashanu, Scales, Phelan, goalkeeper Dave Beasant and Andy Thorn attended the premiere of The Crazy Gang in London on Thursday night alongside their ex-managers Dave Bassett and Bobby Gould and chairman Sam Hammam, while Jones sent his apologies from Los Angeles where he now works as a film actor. The documentary described in their own words how a collection of misfits and failures changed the landscape of English football in the 1980s, partly through a culture of intimidation and violence, towards each other and opponents. Fashanu (left) and Wally Downes (right) embrace Jones after a goal against Sheffield Wednesday . Alongside glory moments like winning promotion to the First Division and winning the FA Cup were reminders of darker times, including Fashanu fracturing the eye socket of Tottenham defender Gary Mabbutt, Jones ending the career of England defender Gary Stevens and also squeezing Paul Gascoigne’s testicles. But most shocking to fans will be the violence that existed within the club – something Fashanu, a black belt in karate, did little to hide in the film. CLICK HERE to read more about the Crazy Gang, as former midfielder admits some players broke down in tears from dressing room abuse. His close pal Jones recalled one dressing-room fight between Fashanu and an unnamed player that left him particularly stunned. ‘Fash threw him around like a rag doll, I’ve never seen anything like it, never seen nothing like it,’ said the tough-guy actor. ‘We had wooden benches that went around, Fash literally lifted him up, swung him around and smashed him down on the floor and his calf just obliterated. ‘The fella had to have 20 stitches or 30 stitches in his calf, split it to bits. ‘Fash could be hilarious, a very funny man. But when he was angry, he was a very tough man. He didn’t hold off.’ There was also the feud between Fashanu and Sanchez that ended with Sanchez calling a reporter and telling him the striker had tried to karate-kick his legs. Defender Scales was an eye-witness, saying: ‘We were used to see very unusual things and heavy conflicts but that physical face-to-face coming to blows was the most shocking thing I saw.’ And striker Terry Gibson revealed: ‘For six years they never spoke to each other. They were in the same changing room but wouldn’t even celebrate together.’ Fashanu was an intimidating figure to both the opposition and his own team-mates, it has been revealed . Referee Keith Hacket gets an earful from Fashanu and John Scales during a win against Southampton . Tottenham defender Gary Mabbutt was left with a fractured skull after a clash with Fashanu in 1993 . Sanchez admits the rift started almost immediately. ‘From the first moment, he knew what I was and I knew what he was,’ he said. Goalkeeper Beasant thought Sanchez, who unusually for footballers of that generation held a university degree, regarded the more streetwise Fashanu as pretentious for using words in conversations when he didn’t know what they meant. Fashanu comes across as largely unapologetic in the film but does admit at one stage: ‘Sometimes I even wince at some of things we made them do. Locking them in the boot of their car, dragging them around the pitch in the snow. You can’t eat for two days, someone will sit there and make sure you don’t eat. ‘I suggested to Scalesy (John Scales) that it might be an idea if we see the manager. He didn’t quite understand my English I don’t think, because the second time there was no word, I just grabbed him by his nostrils. ‘He had one of two choices, you either sink or swim. There were days when you thought Scalesy was almost breaking because it was not easy for him. Jones was Wimbledon's midfield enforcer as they made an impact on the top flight of English football . Jones gives Nottingham Forest striker Bryan Roy a piece of his mind during a fiery clash in 1994 . ‘But if he and Phelo (Terry Phelan) saw us today, they would say ""Thank you, Fash"", you may have beaten the hell out of us but you changed our character.’ While some of the Crazy Gang like Fashanu, Jones and Dennis Wise loved the atmosphere instigated by manager Dave Bassett and assistant Wally Downes, some of the later signings found it hard to cope. Scales, signed from Bristol Rovers, admits on camera: ‘The first thing I’d think about was getting down to the pub and getting away from it, having a drink. Was it conducive to me playing well? Obviously not as an athlete. But at that stage it was a coping mechanism. ‘I had some pretty frank, long conversations with my dad, saying, ""Is this really what I want to do, is this a place I want to be, I can’t cope, I am finding it incredibly different"". Yes, (it was a) challenging place to be in my life and around the club. ‘I remember getting in the car and getting psyched up for training so I would be able to cope with it, to have the confidence to be assertive. I knew if I was that person who was relatively shy and unassuming, the Crazy Gang would swallow me up.’ Defender John Scales is one player who has admitted he struggled to cope with the bullying culture . Phelan, a left back brought in from Swansea City, recalls seeing some players cry at the abuse they received. He said: ‘It was like a pack of wolves going out looking for blood. It wasn’t normal. I’ve seen players actually cry, physically break down and cry. It was a place for me that was really dark for six months, socially and emotionally. ‘As a footballer you have dreams, for six months I had no dreams. I used to sit in my bedroom upstairs, and I’d say, ""My career is gone, where can I go from here?"". Downes is unrepentant at creating a culture where only the strongest survived. ‘Very, very, very tough love,’ he described it as. Scales and Phelan did survive and shared in the FA Cup glory. But some of the most savage treatment was saved for opponents, with centre half Thorn admitting: ‘We went too far loads of times.’ Beasant and Sanchez show off the FA Cup on an open-top bus - but there were tensions in the squad . Jones and Fashanu were big mates, but the big striker came to blows with Sanchez . Dennis Wise was a terrier in Wimbeldon's midfield and worked in tandem with Jones to intimidate players . Cork recalls putting Steve Bruce’s nose out of place on one side in the opening minutes of the game and then catching him on the other side. Jones, who has gone on to have a successful career as an actor playing gangsters and tough guys, summed up the deliberate intimidation. ‘There was a few punch-ups, there were a few confrontations, we just went out, “How dare you think you can walk over us like we are a piece of crap on your shoes”. Shut up, bang,’ he said. ‘We’d look for an opponent who was weak and play on it. I’d say, ""Wisey we’ve got one here"". Or he might say ""Jonesy, we’ve got one here"". ‘We’d shout “Put it in the mixer”, when the ball was in the air you’d see their legs going, they’d be thinking “Oh, s***”. We were a proper organised force.’ Bassett admits his management philosophy was, ""Why take 12 passes when you can get it up in one?"". It was refined slightly when he was replaced by Gould in 1987 but only slightly. ‘He (Gould) just did what he was told,’ smiled Gibson. The most infamous photograph of Wimbledon's Crazy Gang era - Jones grabbing Paul Gascoigne's testicles . The Wimbledon story, from non-League to First Division in nine years, will probably never be repeated. For many of their players, it was a final chance to beat the odds and a new family. Barnado’s child Fashanu, hod carrier Jones and Southampton reject Wise all went on to great careers after leaving Wimbledon, their characters moulded by learning at a tough school. There was black humour too with Bassett suggesting setting Cork’s car on fire after he had blocked him getting a pay rise. ‘He said “What am I going to do”, I said ""Go and burn your car and claim on the insurance"",’ said Bassett. And the fire did take place. It was the violence though that will divide opinion as to whether Wimbledon’s story was a fairytale or a nightmare. The last word had to go to Fashanu, of course. Did he have any regrets? ‘Not striking Lawrie Sanchez sooner,’ he replied.

"Mario Balotelli has been charged by the Football Association for posting an allegedly abusive or insulting image on social media. It is unlikely, though, this incident will result in the end of the striker’s Liverpool career, as the club have no plans to sell him in the January transfer window. Balotelli’s contract has clauses in it relating to his behaviour but Liverpool are continuing to work with the 24-year-old. Liverpool striker Mario Balotelli has been charged by the FA for a controversial image posted to Instagram . Balotelli has struggled at Liverpool since arriving last summer and is yet to score a Premier League goal . The Liverpool striker insisted that he meant no offence by tweeting that his mother is Jewish . QPR defender Rio Ferdinand was also charged under FA rule E3 back in October. The former Manchester United man was handed a three-match suspension and fined £25,000 for a tweet which included the word 'sket' - slang for a promiscuous female. Ferdinand had previously been fined £45,000 in 2012 for referring to then Chelsea defender Ashley Cole as a 'choc ice' on Twitter. He sparked the latest controversy by posting an image on Instagram that depicted the computer game character Super Mario which read: ‘Don’t be racist — be like Mario. He’s an Italian plumber created by Japanese people who speaks English and looks like a Mexican.’ But below the image, the words continued: ‘jumps like a black man and grabs coin like a Jew.’ Balotelli quickly deleted the picture from his account and responded to criticism, tweeting: ‘My Mom is Jewish so all of you shut up please.’ He subsequently apologised on Twitter on Tuesday, insisting the image was meant to be ‘anti-racist with humour’. The FA found him in breach of rule E3[1] and the Italian has until 6pm on December 15 to say how he will answer the charge. Balotelli submitted evidence of how he has been racially abused on social media after he was asked by the FA for his observations about the image he reposted on Instagram on Monday night. That, however, has not stopped the FA taking action. The FA added in a statement: ‘It is further alleged that this is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief.’ After Balotelli submits his decision, his case will be heard by a three-person committee but there is no fixed penalty, unlike if an incident happened during a game.

'It is further alleged that this is an ‘Aggravated Breach’ as defined by FA Rule E3[2] as it included a reference to ethnic origin and/or colour and/or race and/or nationality and/or religion or belief. 'The player has until 6pm on 15 December 2014 to respond to the charge.' A Liverpool spokesperson said: ‘We acknowledge the FA’s decision and the player will work through the process to answer the charge. While that process is ongoing, the club will not be making any further comment.’ Nicolas Anelka was given the minimum five-match suspension and an £80,000 fine in February for making a quenelle gesture during West Brom’s game with West Ham last December. He was later sacked by the club. By contrast, Benoit Assou-Ekotto was banned for three matches and fined £50,000 for congratulating Anelka via Twitter on making the gesture, which is viewed as being anti-Semitic. Since joining Liverpool from AC Milan for £16million, Balotelli has rarely been out of the headlines, thanks to his poor form, swapping shirts with Real Madrid defender Pepe at half-time during a Champions League game and questions about his attitude. He will miss Saturday's game against Sunderland at Anfield as he recovers from a groin problem that he suffered on international duty. This is a crucial period for the club and Brendan Rodgers is adamant there will be no distractions. He said: ‘Sunderland is a big game. Basle, Manchester United away, the League Cup game the week after. It’s a period of big games. I need to choose a team that’s going to be fit and fresh.’ Balotelli apologised for his Instagram post, insisting it was meant to be 'anti-racist with humour' QPR defender Rio Ferdinand was given a three-match suspension by the FA in October for an offensive tweet .

SECOND RED CARD (March 2011) Balotelli apologises to his team-mates after he is sent off during a Europa League tie with Dynamo Kiev for a reckless challenge on Goran Popov. BACK-HEEL BLUNDER (July 2011) Balotelli is immediately substituted by an enraged Mancini after performing a pirouette and back-heeling wide when clean through on goal in a pre-season friendly against the Los Angeles Galaxy. FIREWORKS AT HOME (October 2011) Ten firefighters used breathing apparatus as they put out a blaze at Balotelli's  £7,500-a-month house in Mottram St Andrew, Cheshire, after fireworks were set off in a bathroom. The Italian was left with a repair bill of £400,000. THIRD RED CARD (November 2011) The third red card of Balotelli's City career arrives in a league match against Liverpool, the 21-year-old dismissed for two yellow cards. BREAKING CURFEW (December 2011) Balotelli breaks a club 48-hour curfew by visiting a curry house ahead of a match against Chelsea. RICHARDS CLASH (December 2011) Just days after Balotelli's curfew lapse, he again attracts negative headlines after pictures emerge of a training-ground bust-up with team-mate Micah Richards. PARKER CLASH (January 2012) Balotelli is charged with violent conduct by the Football Association, and subsequently handed a four-match ban, after appearing to stamp on the head of Tottenham's Scott Parker during a Premier League match. INTER PRESS CONFERENCE (March 2012) Balotelli gatecrashes the press conference to announce the appointment of Andrea Stramaccioni as Inter Milan's new coach. FOURTH RED CARD (April 2012) Balotelli is sent off for two bookable challenges on Arsenal full-back Bacary Sagna. Also guilty of a shocking knee-high challenge on Gunners midfielder Alex Song.

"Ukraine alleged today that a huge convoy of up to 100 Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers had infiltrated its territory. If confirmed, the claim could destroy a new 'roadmap' to peace discussed by the two countries' leaders and EU officials at a Minsk summit less than 24 hours earlier. The news comes as a column of Ukrainian tanks, trucks and heavy artillery was pictured massing near the town of Mariupol, close to where Pro-Moscow separatists began shelling today. A column of Ukrainian tanks, heavy weapons and trucks have been pictured massing near the town of Mariupol after reports Russian armoured vehicles crossed the border . Ukrainian soldiers towing a heavy artillery gun rest outside Mariupol, a short distance from the town of Novoazovsk that Pro-Moscow separatists began shelling earlier today . There was also a second report of a border crossing by five armoured infantry carriers and one truck at Amvrosiyivka (pictured, troops outside Mariupol) Smoke billows from a building that has been shelled on the outskirts of the small southern Ukrainian city of Novoazovsk in the Donetsk region . Earlier today Vladimir Putin . faced anguished calls from soldiers' mothers and wives demanding that he . brings home alive the men detained in Ukraine. The emotional pleas from the women, and the disturbing account of an enormous new deployment of Russian firepower in Ukraine, raises searching questions on Mr Putin's aims in the dispute, hours after he informed the world he was committed to an end to bloodshed. Kiev appealed for Nato's help yesterday over the new convoy, alleged to be travelling towards Telmanove, 50 miles south of rebel-held city Donetsk and 13 miles inside the border. A Ukrainian military source insisted the convoy must be Russian in origin. 'You cannot buy 100 tanks at a market in Donetsk or Lugansk,' the source told French news agency AFP. 'Of course they have been moved from across the border.' Firefighters work to extinguish a fire shelling by pro-Russian militants in the southern Ukrainian city of Novoazovsk . Members of the Ukrainian volunteer battalion stand in a steel armoured truck after the country appealed for NATO's help with the conflict . Ukraine alleged on Wedensday that a huge convoy of up to 100 Russian tanks, armoured vehicles and rocket launchers had infiltrated its territory . There was a second report of a border crossing by five armoured infantry carriers and one Kamaz truck at Amvrosiyivka, said security spokesman Andriy Lysenko. Ukrainian premier Arseny Yatseniuk said his country needed 'practical help' from Nato, with which it has the status of a special partner, and demanded 'momentous' decisions at its summit in Wales in early September. He also claimed Russia was set to turn off the gas supply taps to Europe this winters. Nato chief Anders Fogh Rasmussen vowed to create a new 'spearhead' force with 'very, very high readiness' to cope with what the alliance saw as Russia's new belligerence. It came as the strategically important town of Novoazovsk, in the south-east of the country, was shelled by pro-Russian forces today. The attack raised fears of a counter-offensive by Ukrainian forces. In . response to outgoing fire early this morning, pro-Moscow forces lobbed . at least 10 shells at the Kiev stronghold, with plumes . of black smoke rising above the town. Mr Putin alleged the detention of 10 Russian servicemen came after they crossed the border 'by accident', a claim widely disbelieved in Kiev, which claims it has faced repeated attacks from Kremlin troops in a conflict which has seen almost 2,300 deaths.

Mother of Yegor Pochtoyev, Olga begs Putin to bring her son back, after he was captured in Ukraine . A video was also released with a group of tearful mothers pleading for them to be returned, as some of the captives appeared at a press conference in Kiev. However it received little play on major state-run TV channels. 'My child, Yegor Pochtoyev, is currently a captive in Ukraine. I beg you in the name of God - give me my child back,' urged his mother, Olga. 'Give him back alive. Him and all the other men that are captives with him. 'Son, and other boys - we are with you. We will take you out of it no matter what happens. 'If the military chief won't do it - we, your mothers, will get you out.'

She demanded of Putin and defence minister Sergei Shoigu: 'Help them, rescue them, bring them back home safe and sound.' The relatives of other detainee soldiers Sergey Arkhipov and Sergey Smirnov also begged for their release. Newspaper Vedomosti expressed a growing questioning of the Kremlin's policies in Ukriane. 'Silence or incoherent commentaries from official bodies only strengthen the atmosphere of suspicion and make us remember unpleasant episodes of Russian and Soviet history.' Earlier, Ukraine president Petro Poroshenko said he was committed to a new roadmap to peace, and would work for a ceasfire in fighting. Mr Putin - while accused of flooding eastern Ukraine with fighters and military equipment - said he had no role in organising a truce. Blitzed: Smoke rises from the Kiev-held town of Novoazovsk after it was shelled by rebel forces, raising fears they are launching a counter-offensive hours after leaders met to discuss the escalating crisis . Bombardment: Ukrainians watch the attack on Novoazovsk by Pro-Moscow forces. The town was also hit repeatedly by shelling on Tuesday, injuring four people in a hospital, mayor Oleg Sidorkin said . Novoazovsk lies on the Azov Sea on the road that runs from Russia to the major Ukrainian port of Mariupol and west to Crimea, raising fears the separatists are seeking to create a land link between Russia and Crimea, which Russia annexed in March. On Tuesday, Mr Putin and Mr Poroshenko met in the Belarusian capital of Minsk for their first ever one-on-one meeting, which lasted over two hours. Mr Poroshenko called the talks 'overall positive' and said Mr Putin had accepted the principles of his peace plan, which includes an amnesty for those in the east not accused of serious crimes and calls for some decentralisation of power to the region.

Mr Putin, however, insisted that only Kiev could secure a ceasefire deal with the pro-Moscow separatists, saying the internal conflict was 'Ukraine's business'. Russia 'can only help to create an atmosphere of trust for this important and necessary process,' Mr Putin said. 'We in Russia cannot talk about any conditions for the ceasefire, about any agreements between Kiev, Donetsk, Luhansk [the two rebel regions].'

"A leading Labour MP has claimed that 2,000 Britons have travelled to Iraq and Syria to fight for ISIS and other jihadist organisations. Khalid Mahmood, MP for the Birmingham Perry Barr constituency, claimed that official figures on the numbers of British jihadis is grossly underestimating the size of the problem. UK security officials believe in the region of 500 men have travelled to Iraq and Syria, but Mr Mahmood claims this figure is widely inaccurate. Scroll down for video . Labour MP Khalid Mahmood believes British jihadists are being able to enter the country due to lax security . Abu Abdullah al-Habashi, left, and Abu Dharda, right, are believed to have been killed in Kobane, Syria . He said: 'The authorities say there are 500 British jihadists but the likely figure is at least three to four times that. I think 2,000 is a better estimate. My experience in Birmingham is it is a huge, huge problem.' Mr Mahmood told the Sunday Telegraph: 'The Government does not have significant people at border control. The fact is these jihadists are coming in and going out without almost ever being arrested. We have had hardly any arrests. We have had people coming back in after six months in Syria and they are not being picked up.' Mr Mahmood's warning follows reports that British jihadis Abu Dharda, 20 and Abu Abdullah al Habashi, 21. The two men from London are believed to have been killed in heavy fighting in the Syrian border town of Kobane, which has been the subject of a major counter-offensive by Kurdish fighters, supported by US Air Force bombers. Al-Habashi grew up in north London in a British-Eritrean family and converted to Islam at the age of 16. The US Air Force has been using the fearsome B1-b bomber to attack ISIS targets in Kobane, Syria . He told the BBC back in August that he was one of the few British jihadists who fought with ISIS in Syria and Iraq. During the interview, he admitted that he was never going to return to Britain despite the pleas of his family. Dhardra grew up in west London and is from a British-Somali background. He entered Syria in December 2013 after crossing the Turkish border. Almost 30 Britons are believed to have been killed fighting for jihadist organisations although the Foreign Office confirmed that determining exact figures is incredibly difficult. A spokesman said: 'We are aware of reports of the death of two British nationals in Syria. 'The UK has advised for some time against all travel to Syria, where all UK consular services are suspended. 'As we do not have any representation in Syria, it is extremely difficult to get any confirmation of deaths or injuries and our options for supporting British nationals there are extremely limited.'","Khalid Mahmood claimed officials have underestimated Jihadi numbers .

"Alexis Sanchez will be given next week off after Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger admitted his £30million man is in the ‘red zone’. The Chile international has been one of the stars of the season so far following his switch from Barcelona. But, including internationals, Sanchez has played 27 games since August, and this has taken a toll. And Wenger will rest the striker after today’s clash with Stoke.Arsenal head to Turkey on Monday for their Champions League clash against Galatasaray, but Sanchez will stay in London. VIDEOS Scroll to watch . Chile international Alexis Sanchez is pictured in training on Friday at Arsenal's London Colney base . Sanchez braced the winter elements as he trained with his team-mates ahead of the Stoke clash . Sanchez has starred for Arsenal since his £30million arrival from Barcelona in the summer . Sanchez is put through his paces in trainingas the Gunners look to make it three wins on the spin . Sanchez shares a joke with Lukas Podolski after Arsenal's 1-0 victory over Southampton on Wednesday . The Chile international takes on Southampton's Ryan Bertrand at the Emirates Stadium . It Is no surprise to see Sanchez in the ‘red zone’ — the forward has played more minutes, in all competitions, than any other Premier League outfield player this season (1,771). That is considerably more than the likes of Chelsea’s Eden Hazard (1,673) and Manchester City’s Sergio Aguero (1,435). He has also played 530 minutes for the Chile national team this season, compared to Hazard’s 180 minutes and Aguero’s 205 for Belgium and Argentina respectively. With the Gunners already through to the knockout stages and with little chance of finishing above Borussia Dortmund at the top of Group D, Wenger views next week as the perfect time for Sanchez to recover. ‘He will not go to Turkey,’ Wenger confirmed. ‘He will need a week’s break, I did it with many players before who were playing every game. ‘I did it with (Thierry) Henry, with (Robin) Van Persie and it always helped them to get through without injury. ‘Sanchez is in the red zone, you can see when he plays, but he can dig deep. Sanchez is mobbed by his Arsenal team-mates after scoring the winning goal against Southampton . ‘He played his 27th game on Wednesday (against Southampton) since the start of the season. Unfortunately you never know how far you can push it. ‘We are not scientific enough to predict that completely but he recovers very quickly.’ Wenger hopes the decision to give Sanchez a breather next week will help his star man maintain his exceptional form. And the manager says Sanchez is now revelling in the spotlight after emerging from Lionel Messi’s shadow at Barcelona. ‘It’s not easy in a team where you have such a dominant figure as Messi,’ said Wenger. ‘The game naturally goes through the strong point so in Barcelona the game goes through Messi. It means the other players become a bit more peripheral. ‘You can see now when you watch Barcelona, Luis Suarez was dominant at Liverpool and now you think “where is he?”’ Wenger was also left contemplating a mixed bag of injury updates to his fragile squad on Friday. The Arsenal ace is shoved off the ball and Wenger fears his new signing is in the 'red zone' Arsenal have been boosted by the return to full training of Mathieu Debuchy and Wojciech Szczesny, but are sweating on the fitness of Kieran Gibbs (hip) and Laurent Koscielny (achilles) for the match with Stoke. Theo Walcott (groin), Tomas Rosicky (thigh), Yaya Sanogo (calf) and Nacho Monreal (ankle) have been ruled out. Mesut Ozil (knee), Mikel Arteta (calf) and Jack Wilshere (ankle) are all long-term absentees. Walcott had an injection on Friday in the hope of clearing up a groin problem that has dogged him since the last international break, but he won’t be available until next week at the earliest. In light of Gibbs and Monreal’s injury struggles, Wenger confirmed Arsenal’s interest in Ipswich left back Tyrone Mings. Sportsmail revealed on Friday that the Gunners will look to sign him next month, and have been quoted a price of £10million. And Wenger said: ‘He is one of the players we follow, but we are not close to signing anybody at the moment.’","Sanchez has been Arsenal's top performer this season, scoring 14 goals .

"Crystal Palace forward Wilfried Zaha has lifted the lid on his difficult time at Manchester Untied. Zaha, tipped as one of English football's brightest prospects at the time, was signed from Palace by former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013 for a fee believed to be around £15 million. But he was loaned straight back to The Eagles for the remainder of the season and did not arrive at Old Trafford until the following summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. Zaha was signed by former Manchester Untied manager Sir Alex Ferguson for around £15m in January 2013 . 'Sir Alex obviously saw something in me and that's why he brought me to United. But I never got to be coached by him. I signed and by the time I came back (from the loan spell at Palace), he had left. That was weird,' Zaha told The Sun. The forward was a peripheral figure under Moyes, used sparingly and sometimes out of position. And the lack of first-team opportunities afforded to him, coupled with the stresses of moving to Manchester alone, proved frustrating for the youngster. 'I had a lot to deal with living on my own in Manchester. It was lonely. It wasn't the best,' he said, 'If you're not playing, you're not happy.' After failing to make an impact under Moyes, Zaha was loaned to Cardiff City for the second half of last season. Although life off the pitch improved at Cardiff, with one of Zaha's brothers making the move to the Welsh capital to keep him company, the forward's form did not, as he contributed just one assist in 11 games. Zaha found first-team opportunities hard to come by at United and has been loaned back to Crystal Palace . Zaha returned to Palace again at the start of this season on another loan deal and could yet rejoin The Eagles permanently in the summer. The 22-year-old has been given a new lease of life under Palace boss Alan Pardew and is working hard towards rediscovering the sort of of form that led United to sign him two years ago. For now, though, Zaha remains focused simply on playing regular, first-team football and will leave any decisions on his future until the end of the season. 'I'm not ruling anything in or out. I'm just going to play,' he said. The 22-year-old forward is working hard to rediscover the form that led Untied to sign him in the first place .","Wilfried Zaha signed for Manchester United in 2013 for £15m .

"A disabled mother has been fined £120 for taking her youngest child out of primary school during term time. The mother-of-four, who wishes to remain anonymous, suffered a stroke after paying the charge, according to campaign group Parents Want a Say. The woman's three oldest children were given permission to go on vacation by their secondary school, but her youngest child was not allowed. Despite this, the family went ahead with the holiday, as it was funded by a charity, who could only afford term-time holidays. The mother was slapped with the charge when she returned from the trip. Since the rules, heads have turned down requests for children to skip school for term-time holidays, as well as refusing applications for pupils to attend relatives' weddings, funerals and even leave on doctor's advice . Changes to the law, which came into force on September 1, mean schools no longer have the discretion to grant 10 days of authorised leave to pupils each year. Instead, headteachers are being told they should only approve an absence under 'exceptional circumstances'. The new rules are aimed at preventing youngsters missing vital chunks of their education. In the year before the new legislation was introduced, the number of parents hit with fines soared by nearly 70 per cent in the past year. Some 63,837 penalties were issued to parents in the academic year to July 2014 in England, compared with 37,650 fines throughout the previous 12 months. The new legislation, brought in on September 1, aims to prevent youngsters missing chunks of their education . The move has been criticised by campaigners who claim it is unfair on parents and has no affect on the level of a child's academic achievement. Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, is chairman of campaign group Parents Want a Say, which has collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who oppose the new rules. He told MailOnline: 'The government's own research says that a small amount of authorised holidays has no negative affect on achievement and may in fact result in better outcomes. 'The time that parents have to concentrate on their children means that if they do ensure that work is put into academic issues then it can be better for the children. 'The only benefit to be expected from the new policy is for Ofsteds statistics on absence to look different. We should concentrate on what is best for the children rather than ticking Ofsted's boxes.' He added: 'There are many cases where families are badly impacted by the new rules.  Families should be supported by the government rather than family life made more difficult.' Mr Hemming said he would raise the case of the disabled mother with Nicky Morgan, the Education Secretary. A spokesman for the local authority that imposed the penalty charge, said it could not comment on individual cases, but added: 'Cases such as this create difficult decisions for head teachers, particularly in the light of changes introduced by national government at the beginning of this year, which dramatically restrict their ability to exercise discretion. 'If absence is not authorised and parents still take their children out of school then the local authority is obliged to issue a penalty notice.' Liberal Democrat MP, John Hemming, is chairman of campaign group Parents Want a Say, which has collected more than 200,000 signatures from parents who oppose the new rules . In one of the most high profile cases, Kerry Capper, 25, was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days. Miss Capper said she let her daughter have the odd day off to 'keep an eye on her' as she was recovering from cancer. In 2010, her daughter Libby Bennett had been diagnosed with a tumour in one of her kidneys, but recovered after several months of chemotherapy. The cancer has not come back but Libby remains under the care of Birmingham Children's Hospital for regular check-ups. Between January and March this year Miss Capper kept Libby at home for a total of seven days when she felt unwell, instead of sending her to Paget Primary School, in Pype Hayes, Birmingham. She was ordered to pay a £120 penalty fine, but was cleared of a criminal act. Kerry Capper, 25, was cleared at Birmingham Magistrates' Court last month for keeping her daughter off school for seven days . In another case taken up by the campaign group, a five-year-old was refused permission to go with her parents on the family's first holiday abroad. Pauline and Craig Stephenson from Cramlington, Northumberland, asked Northburn Primary School for leave to take their daughter Lauren to France for a week in September. Craig Stephenson, a police officer, can only take leave only at authorised times. Because of his work commitments he was not able to take time off during the six-week holidays. The school refused but the family still went. 'Now we are left in limbo wondering whether we will be fined,' said Pauline Stephenson. 'It is not something we would normally do but we took books for her and the trip was educational. We went into Paris and Lauren learnt French words. 'I feel annoyed because we are good parents and we take school very seriously. This is the only family holiday we have ever had abroad.' In a separate case, James and Dana Haymore, from Chelmsford, refused to pay Essex County Council a £120 fine for taking their three children to the US to attend a family memorial service. He refused to pay a £120 fine from his local council and was expected to appear in court where he faced a £2,500 fine and a jail term. But the council said it was no longer in the public interest to pursue the case as the family left to live in the US. Elsewhere, 41-year-old salesman Jason Short left his job, so he could take his family away during the school holidays. Plymouth City Council fined Mr Short £120 for taking seven-year-old Madeleine on holiday to Turkey in June, during the only time he was allowed to take off work. He claims he had explained the situation to teachers at Salisbury Road Primary School in Plymouth and was told not to worry but was later hit with the fine. But he returned home after the break to find he had a letter from the council stating he would be fined for taking Madeleine out of school without permission.","Mother was fined £120 for taking her youngest child out of school in term .

"A group of hackers has exposed the mobile phone numbers of 4.6 million U.S. Snapchat users, to 'raise awareness of the app's security issues'. The anonymous hackers released the database a week after Snapchat claimed it had introduced measures to fix a security glitch, which it was told could result in users' personal information being put at risk. The group has released the database via a website SnapchatDB, giving people the option to download the list of usernames and phone numbers as well as their location. A group of anonymous hackers released the phone numbers of 4.6 million Snapchat users on New Year's Day in the U.S. to 'raise awareness' of the site's security vulnerabilties . The hackers redacted the last two digits of each number, claiming the stunt was designed to 'raise awareness' of the issue. The group have left the usernames in their entirety adding that people tend to use the same username across the internet. In a statement on the site Snapchat DB, the group of hackers said: 'This information was acquired through the recently patched Snapchat exploit and is being shared with the public to raise awareness on the issue. 'The company was too reluctant at patching the exploit until they knew it was too late and companies that we trust with our information should be more careful when dealing with it. 'For now, we have censored the last two digits of the phone numbers in order to minimise spam and abuse.' The group said it would consider releasing the original database, without the redacted digits, 'under certain circumstances'. The hackers redacted the last two digits of each phone number on the list to avoid hacked account holders being abused. However, they later said in a statement they would consider releasing the original database 'under certain circumstances' On Christmas Day Australian security research group, Gibson Security revealed details of a security hole affecting the Snapchat site. The security group revealed how the vulnerability on the site could be manipulated and added that Snapchat did not respond to their warnings when they raised the issue months ago. Gibson Security tweeted that it had no involvement in the release of the users' personal information. The tweet said: 'We know nothing about SnapchatDB, but it was a matter of time til something like that happened.' After Gibson published its findings Snapchat said it took user privacy seriously and replied in a blogpost. It said: 'Theoretically, if someone . were able to upload a huge set of phone numbers, like every number in an . area code, or every possible number in the US, they could create a . database of the results and match usernames to phone numbers that way. 'Over . the past year we’ve implemented various safeguards to make it more . difficult to do. We recently added additional counter-measures and . continue to make improvements to combat spam and abuse.' On Christmas Day an Australian security firm Gibson Security revealed a vulnerability with the site, which could lead to users' personal information being leaked. Snapchat said it had taken action to address the issue . The MailOnline has contacted Snapchat for comment on the release of the SnapchatDB database - they have yet to respond. Snapchat is a photo messaging app. It allows users to take photos, record videos and add messages and drawings. Messages are known as snaps and users can set a time limit on how long recipients can view their snap, ranging from one to 10 seconds. The snap is then deleted from the recipient's phone and erased from Snapchat's servers. Google Play lists the app as having been downloaded between 10 million and 50 million times.","Hackers release database of phone numbers, usernames and locations .

"West Ham manager Sam Allardyce passed up the opportunity to sign Swansea forward Wilfried Bony - with Andy Carroll brought in instead. Allardyce revealed he had been scouting Bony when the Ivory Coast international was in prolific form at Dutch club Vitesse Arnhem in 2013 but a move never materialised as he was able to strike a deal with Liverpool to sign Carroll on a permanent basis instead. Bony completed a move to the Swans and has been in scintillating form, scoring more Premier League goals in the calender year than any other player. West Ham manager Sam Allardyce said the club turned down the chance to sign Wilfried Bony (above) Allardyce said: 'We signed Andy Carroll and it was one or the other. 'It couldn't be both and we ended up getting a deal done with Andy so our interest (in Bony) ended because we couldn't do both. We didn't have enough money in the budget that year. 'We spent big money on Andy and the rest had to be proportioned out for the considerable amount of other players we needed at the time.' While Bony has been drawing plaudits for his performances in Garry Monk's side, Carroll is still working his way back to full fitness after suffering the second long-term injury since his loan switch from Anfield was made permanent. West Ham signed Carroll from Liverpool on loan in 2012-13 and then made the deal permanent in the summer . Carroll has suffered a number of injury setbacks during his time at Upton Park . The duo are likely to lead the line for their respective sides when Swansea and West Ham meet at Upton Park on Sunday and Allardyce admits preventing Bony adding to his 18 league goals in 2014 will be tough. 'I think it is very difficult to stop him,' he added. 'In the main it'll be about not only the defenders but the team as a whole stopping the supply. If you work hard on shutting down their midfield and wide areas and limit the supply then that is the best way forward but that won't happen all the time. Bony's goal against Crystal Palace on Saturday was his 18th in the Premier League in 2014 . Carroll has only scored twice for West Ham since making his move permanent in the summer of 2013 . 'When I say we have to get tight on him, we have to be aware of him without getting too tight because he is very strong and very skilful and to knock him off the ball is not an easy task. 'He seems to be able to roll a lot of defenders and hit the ball in the same movement. He is a threat in the air and it will be very interesting for our lads to compete against someone in such good goalscoring form and hopefully on the day we can keep him quiet.' Bony may have been one striker to pass Allardyce by but the Hammers have their own prolific forward back for this weekend. Summer signing Diafra Sakho, who has scored six goals in eight league appearances so far, has recovered from a back injury and should be involved. Allardyce's West Ham side are flying high in fifth place in the Barclays Premier League . Fellow new recruit Enner Valencia could also start his first game after working his way back to fitness and, along with Carroll and his other forwards, Allardyce is pleased with the wealth of talent he has in attacking areas. 'We're looking forward to having Diafra back, I'm not sure he's ready to start a match yet,' he added. 'Having Enner back, Andy getting more and more match fitness; Carlton Cole and Mauro Zarate, our attacking options are the best we have ever had. 'There are a number of combinations we can now play to break down the opposition. It was nice to score two goals to come from behind at West Brom and it has put us all in a very confident mood having won two games in a short period of time. 'Game three coming up on Sunday is now a big test for the lads, can we make it a third one in the space of eight days? For us it is trying to maintain our results record and try and get more points on the board. If we can get three, what a great week that would be.'","Sam Allardyce admitted he was interested in signing Wilfried Bony .

What more can I say? ‘I am always occupied with the first match and that’s Southampton. After the match we can say that but before it is always difficult.’ The return of Rooney will be a big boost to Van Gaal who also has Radamel Falcao in contention for a starting spot up front.

At the height of the U.S. occupation of the country, Iraq boasted 400,000 combat forces. But the number of able troops had dwindled down to roughly half that by last summer, the Post said. In September Gen. Martin Dempsey, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told reporters that U.S. military assessors had discovered that 24 of the Iraqi army's existing 50 brigades were not fit to fight because of their sectarian differences. The remaining 26 brigades didn't have the right training and equipment, Dempsey admitted, making it impossible for the nation to properly defend itself against ISIS. The Washington Post said Thursday that an updated count conducted by Michael Knights, a fellow with the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, now puts the number of active brigades at just 36. In any case, the country isn't currently equipped to launch an offensive against ISIS that would allow it to retake its largest city, Mosul. That sort of a mission would require roughly 80,000 soldiers, Dempsey has said. In September he suggested that a time may come when U.S. ground forces would be needed to supplement Iraqi forces if they underwent a major incursion to retake Mosul but has made it clear he's made no such recommendation to the president. As of the beginning of November the U.S. had 1,400 non-combat troops in Iraq serving as advisers with the option to send in up to 1,700 more under the direction of President Barack Obama. Obama has ruled out putting American combat boots on the ground to the irritation of lawmakers who would like to see the U.S. take a more aggressive role in the Middle Eastern conflict. Instead, he has asked for $5.6 billion from Congress to fund his current military campaign against ISIS, including $1.6 billion to train and equip Iraqi and Kurdish forces. The Pentagon said at the time of the request that additional troops and money sent in to Iraq would aid in the creation of 'two expeditionary advise-and-assist operations centers, in locations outside of Baghdad and Irbil, to provide support for the Iraqis at the brigade headquarters level and above. 'These centers will be supported by an appropriate array of force protection,' Pentagon spokesman Rear Adm. John Kirby said in a statement. Kirby also also claimed that U.S. Central Command would 'establish several sites across Iraq that will accommodate the training of 12 Iraqi brigades, specifically nine Iraqi army and three [Kurdish] Peshmerga brigades.' The Washington Post reported Thursday that the U.S. also has high hopes for the creation of a 'national guard' of Iraqi, Shiite and Kurdish peshmerga forces similar to a 2006-2007 program initiative by the U.S. that would be managed by the Iraqi government. The formation of a national guard would have to be approved by the Iraqi legislature, though, and it's no where close to taking that step. U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Army Gen. Martin Dempsey addresses questions from U.S. military members during a town hall meeting in Baghdad, Iraq last week. Dempsey has indicated in the past that U.S. troops may be put into combat situations in Iraq in the future, even though President Barack Obama says they won't . A fighter for ISIS holds holds the group's flag and a weapon on a street in the city of Mosul in June. Iraqi security forces have made substantial progress in taking their country back from the Islamic extremist group, but it will be a long time before it will have the resources to retake Mosul, the nation's largest city . A dozen of the United States' top attack aircraft are being rerouted from Afghanistan to Kuwait to aid in the fight against ISIS. The A-10 Warthogs will also joined within six weeks by Reaper drones as well, the New York Times reports. A-10s come with a 30mm cannon and can carry missiles as well as 500lb bombs. Flying as low as 50ft, the planes are better able to access to targets on the ground than the warplanes currently carrying out airstrikes in Iraq and Syria. They also feature heavy armor, which protects them against small-arms fire and rocket-propelled grenades. In Afghanistan they have proved successful and targeting Taliban near American patrols and keeping the terrorist group at bay. Even legislators who normally take a dovish stance on military intervention, including Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have acknowledged that some U.S. ground forces may be necessary to destroy ISIS, though. Paul plans to introduce legislation after the Thanksgiving holiday that declares war on ISIS in Iraq and Syria and authorizes the president to continue bombing the countries and to deploy U.S. soldiers into combat situations there in certain circumstances, including 'for limited operations against high value targets.' The White House has pointed to old Authorization of Military Force agreements passed by Congress giving George W. Bush permission to invade Iraq and engage terrorists militarily as its legal authority to carry out air strikes in ISIS in the two countries. According to Paul and other Capitol Hill lawmakers, however, the current Commander in Chief's authority to attack the group expired 60 days after the first bomb was dropped, per the War Powers Act, and he must seek new authorization from Congress - which he'll most likely get if it comes up for a vote - to continue the strikes. According to Bloomberg News, the cost of air strikes averaged $8.3 million a day in mid-October and had already cost more than $580 million since they began Aug. 8, data from U.S. Central Command showed. On Thursday Iraq's finance minister Hoshiyar Zebari said his country had made headway in the battle against ISIS in no small part because of the U.S.-led airstrikes. Zebari told Reuters ISIS soldiers are no longer able to engage in direct combat with Iraqi forces because the fighting exposes them to air raids. 'After all these years nobody wants to see a caliphate of hatred. They are no longer an existential threat to our existence,' he said. Iraq army forces and Peshmerga forces are seen here launching a US-led operation in Saadiya in Iraq last weekend. They later regained control of the town in the Diyala region . Iraq army and Peshmerga forces celebrate their victories over ISIS in Saadiya and neighboring town Jalawla . 'They are still a very very serious threat,' though, he cautioned, noting that ISIS has continued to use an array of other guerrilla tactics, including roadside bombs and suicide bombers, to conduct warfare. Zebari said he didn't know how much longer it would take to eliminate ISIS entirely, telling Reuters, 'I don’t have the crystal ball to tell you. It will take some time. 'I think we are winning, they are losing,' he added. Just this week Iraqi soldiers and police working with an Iranian-backed Shiite group and Kurdish peshmerga fighters were able to retake the towns of Saadiya and Jalawla in the Diyala region. Some of the greatest hindrances to additional progress come from within the Iraqi military, not from outside forces, however. 'Definitely we will recommend strongly that there should be some serious deep-rooted reforms in the military security establishment to fight corruption, mismanagement,' Zebari told Reuters while previewing a request to spend close a quarter of the country's 2015 budget on defense spending. Of the most common forms of corruption within the battalions is the enlistment of 'ghost soldiers' - Iraqis who sign up but never show up for service allowing commanders to pocket their pay. 'All the formations have to be reviewed in terms of the numbers. There should be no ghost members of the military,' Zebari said. 'People should be accountable. Your battalion, the number of your members should be accounted for, for weapons or salaries, for munitions for food. These are basic things it doesn’t need a genius (to understand).' Since taking over in August Iraqi's new Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who replaced previous PM Nouri al-Maliki, has already replaced more than 20 senior military commanders, the Post says.","'The idea is, at least in the first instance, to try and build a kind of leaner, meaner Iraqi army,' a senior U.S. official said .

"A woman sparked an air rescue operation after she was knocked unconscious when she fell over her own dog while walking on a remote beach. Marion Browner was fossil hunting with her family  near Cromarty, in the Scottish Highlands, when her fox terrier Nacho became tangled up in her legs. The 50-year-old was knocked unconscious for several minutes after she struck her head on rocks. She woke up to find she had twisted her ankle and bruised her ribs. Remote: Marion Browner was fossil hunting with family near Cromarty in the Scottish Highlands on Sunday when she tripped and hit her head. Above, A Coastguard team arrive to airlift Mrs Browner to hospital . Excitable: Nacho, Mrs Browner's fox terrier, pictured, became tangled up in her owners' legs while walking . Mrs Browner's family alerted paramedics who had to dispatch a Coastguard helicopter as the beach they were on was miles from the nearest road. Mrs Browner was airlifted to Raigmore Hospital in Inverness. She said: 'Things happened so quickly. I was in a lot of pain. It was so dramatic but there was no way I could walk. 'I was knocked out for maybe three or four minutes apparently but when I woke up I was pretty bleary and out of it. 'It's typical of Nacho really, she's always jumping about and is very excitable when out walking. Rescue: Mrs Browner was winched on board a Costguard helicopter, pictured, and taken to Raigmore Hospital in nearby Inverness . 'I just lost sight of her and she got tangled up between my legs, the next thing I know I'm on my back unable to move.' Mrs Browner and her husband, Sean, who run a bed-and-breakfast in Inverness, were at Ethie Haven, on the North Sea coast, on Sunday afternoon when the accident happened. Her family, visiting from Australia, raised the alarm just after 1.30pm but the accident happened miles from the nearest road, meaning paramedics were unable reach them. The Coastguard helicopter from Stornoway, Rescue 100, was sent out and Mrs Browner was winched on board and taken to Raigmore Hospital. She said it had been a huge relief to see the aircraft overhead but was 'petrified' as she was winched up. She said: 'I knew right away I had hurt myself badly. 'Fortunately, my brother-in-law Brendan, who is on holiday from Australia, was with us and, as he is a physiotherapist, he looked after me while we waited for the helicopter to arrive. 'A medic had come along and administered me with morphine because the pain was getting really bad. 'But when they were getting me onto the helicopter it was absolutely petrifying. It was really horrible to see myself get nearer and nearer the blades. 'I don't know if it was the morphine that was making me so scared. 'As well as banging my head, I also hurt my hip and ankle - which is causing me the most pain - and it had to be X-rayed to make sure it wasn't broken.' A spokeswoman for the ambulance service confirmed that a road ambulance had been called out after the alert was received at 1.45pm. She said: 'We were called to assist the Coastguard and tried to reach the casualty on foot, but were unable to do so. 'The Coastguard helicopter transported her to Raigmore Hospital with ankle injuries, which were not thought to be serious.' Treatment: The 50-year-old was knocked unconscious for several minutes after hitting her head on rocks. Above, the Coastguard arrive to help Mrs Browner - who was miles away from the nearest road .

"Louis van Gaal gave Manchester United players the full hairdryer treatment during a stunning dressing room blast following their humiliating 5-3 defeat at Leicester. Van Gaal was furious with his players for allowing a 3-1 lead to slip and led a fiery dressing room inquest with his players following the capitulation. Van Gaal, who has a reputation for losing his temper with his players, was openly critical of his expensively constructed team after their second defeat in the Barclays Premier League. Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs appear in shock after Manchester United's capitulation against Leicester . United players look dejected after the fifth goal at the King Power Stadium . United players celebrate Ander Herrera's goal as the visitors raced to a 3-1 lead at the King Power Stadium . United capitulated to a humbling loss to leave Van Gaal furious at his players for ‘giving the game away’. Van Gaal’s team led 3-1 after an hour but crumbled defensively in the face of Leicester’s energetic attack to suffer defeat after leading by two goals for the first time in Premier League history – a run stretching 853 games. Jamie Vardy, playing non-League football two years ago, terrorised United’s backline with his direct running and had a hand in all the goals, winning two penalties, and finishing calmly to put Nigel Pearson’s side 4-3 up. A Leonardo Ulloa brace, David Nugent spot-kick and Esteban Cambiasso goal added to overturn strikes from Robin van Persie, Angel Di Maria and Ander Herrera as Leicester became only the sixth Premier League team to put five past a United side. Van Gaal named Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Van Persie in the starting line-up but afterwards complained: ‘We have too many players who want to seek for the goal.’ The match turned on Mark Clattenburg’s decision to award a soft penalty in the 62nd minute for a push by Rafael on Vardy after the Leicester striker had shoved the Brazilian to the floor to win the ball. Van Gaal gave United players the hairdryer treatment in the dressing room after the game . Van Gaal looks shattered on the bench as Leicester raced into a 5-3 lead despite the game looking done . Van Gaal declined to criticise the referee but added: ‘I am sitting on the fence. He was waiting for the push but it was stupid to do that. You know you are in the penalty area and you allow the referee to whistle if you make a challenge.’ Sportsmail columnist Jamie Carragher was more forthright on Sky Sports, calling the decision from Clattenburg ‘shocking’. But he criticised United for splashing £150million in the transfer window without securing a ‘proper defender’. ‘Spending all that money and not bringing in a top defender is mismanagement at the end of the day,’ said the former Liverpool defender. ‘United look vulnerable like that at the back this season.’ Rafael (centre) and Wayne Rooney (right) argue with referee Mark Clattenburg after Tyler Blackett was sent off . Injury to Evans means he will miss the match against West Ham on Saturday. ‘Luke Shaw shall be fit enough to play so we can manage it but it is a thin defence,’ conceded Van Gaal. Leicester now stand seventh in the table after a tough run of fixtures and Pearson said: ‘At 3-1 down I would have been happy to get anything out of it. It says a lot about character. I think we have a bit more quality than people may be aware of.’ Vardy added: ‘We knew their full backs would push up and leave a bit of space, which was easy enough for us to exploit when we got the ball and that’s exactly what we’ve done. Every chance has gone in the back of the net.’ Radamel Falcao was taken off on his first start for United as the Colombian striker works towards full fitness .

Cate Carter, who lives nearby, has been able to see one funny side of the dire situation. She told Fox 13: 'I thought about putting a lemonade stand out here, a beer stand, something out there, charging them.' But, pointing at the hole, she added: 'Looking at the road there, it looks like it came down there -- looks like a good six, seven inches. 'This is bad stuff. It could come this way. It could go that way. Who knows? It's very scary.' According to the Hernando County Sheriff's Office, a resident reported it was 25 yards by 25 yards and 30 feet deep on Saturday. Hours later, it was 40 yards by 40 yards. Now it is said to have doubled. One of the nearby homes has already been evacuated and others fear the may be forced to move.

"Three people have died after a small plane crashed into the only vacant lot in a dense Chicago suburb. The twin-engine Beechcraft Baron crashed in Palos Hills on Sunday evening, shortly after takeoff from Chicago Midway Airport as it headed towards Lawrence, Kansas. The aircraft is believed to have experienced mechanical difficulties with residents hearing the engine 'splutter' while it flew overhead. Authorities have said the pilot may have desperately tried to find a place to crash that would avoid casualties on the ground. Scroll down for video . Crash site: Workers remove the wreckage of a small plane that crashed  in the Chicago suburb of Palos Hills. Three people on board were killed in the crash . Investigation: The National Transportation Safety said there is no obvious reasons why the twin-engine plane crashed shortly after taking off from Midway Airport . Palos Hills Deputy Police Chief James Boie said: 'There's only one empty lot in the whole neighborhood and that's where the plane came down. 'Some of the residents said they heard an airplane. It sounded like it was kind of sputtering and then it came down right away. It did come close to one of the houses.' He said he had no immediate identification of the victims, adding a medical examiner was at the site Monday morning. About two blocks all around had been cordoned off by authorities. But he said there was no fire at the time of the crash and no evacuation ordered, though some people were kept away from their homes after the crash. Lunsford said in an earlier email that the FAA had sent a team to investigate and the National Transportation Safety Board had been notified. So far they have found nothing that would point to the cause of why the plane went down. Boie said planes from Midway often fly overhead, but he recalled no incident in recent memory of a small plane crash in the community southwest of downtown Chicago. Michael D'Alessio, who lives with his family a few blocks away from the crash, told The Chicago Tribune he woke up after hearing the sound of the plane going down and called 911 immediately.

When D'Alessio went outside to see what happened, he passed by an airplane seat lying on the ground near the crash.

"Daniel Sturridge has taken to Instagram to prove that he is on the road to recovery as the Liverpool striker trains in Los Angeles in a bid to recover from a thigh injury. The 25-year-old has been sent to the USA to continue his rehabilitation from the injury which has sidelined him for most of the season. Sturridge posted a picture of himself while travelling along with lyrics from Canadian singer PartyNextDoor's 'Don't Worry'. Daniel Sturridge took to Instagram to tell fans he will be back 'stronger and better than ever' The Liverpool striker posted pictures of himself in the gym going through various drills including kettle bell lifts (right) and balancing on a vibrating Power Plate . The English forward tests his balance and strenghtens his leg muscles using a vibrating Power Plate . Sturridge is joined by a personal trainer as the former Chelsea man goes through a stretching exercise . Sturridge also spent time strengthening his legs using kettle bells while in the LA gym . Ankle ligaments - England v Republic of Ireland May 2013, returned for pre-season. Ankle ligaments - December 2013. Missed nine games. Thigh - during England training, September 2014. Missed six weeks. Calf - during Liverpool training, October 2014. Missed three weeks. Thigh - during Liverpool training, November 2014. Out for six weeks. He wrote: 'Don't worry bout me.. People don't count me out cause I got people counting on me. 'Working hard every day to get back fit... Jus know.... I'll be back stronger and better than ever!!' Sturridge also showed off his work in the gym, posting three different images which shows the striker balancing on a vibrating Power Plate and lifting kettle bells. The England forward has not played for the club since August 31 after he initially strained a thigh on international duty. On the eve of his comeback he pulled a calf muscle in his first full training session back with the first team and just when he appeared to have got over that he sustained another, different, thigh injury which has ruled him out until the new year. Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said last month that the club may have to look even deeper into the root of Sturridge's problems - this is the ninth separate but similar injury has had in his career, with the player suggesting the issue may be hereditary as his father, a trainee at Birmingham, and two uncles Dean and Simon - both professional footballers - also suffered the same problems. It is understood the striker has travelled to America to undergo warm-weather training and rehabilitation to help with his recovery for a fortnight. He has not gone to the United States to have any medical treatment or procedure. 25-year-old Sturridge has not played for Liverpool since August and will be out until next year . The striker first injured his thigh while on international duty with England earlier this season . Sturridge scores for Liverpool during their 2-1 victory over Southampton on the first day of the season . 'He has gone away to get some specific work in with some of our staff and he is coming along well,' said Rodgers. Sturridge's absence has been compounded by the failure of £16million summer signing Mario Balotelli to pick up the slack having yet to score a Premier League goal. He too came back injured from the last international break and has not been available since because of a groin problem, forcing Rodgers to pick Rickie Lambert who has responded with two goals in his first two matches leading the line and has put in good performances in the two games since then. With Balotelli facing a possible Football Association charge for posting an apparently anti-Semetic and racist graphic on social media - for which he has until 6pm on Friday to give his explanation to the FA - the spotlight has only intensified on the troubled Italy international. Rodgers insists, however, that until the 24-year-old is available to play he cannot waste much time thinking about him. Mario Balotelli has struggled to make an impact since his £16million move from AC Milan . 'He is a very much a Liverpool player but he is injured at the moment and there is not much more to add from me,' he said. 'He is not fit to play, my concentration at this moment is on players who are fit and available to play and that is my only thinking at the moment. 'He is working with the medical team on a daily basis and I trust the team of people here to look after injuries. 'At this moment in time the team is doing well and whenever he is back fit then we will see where he is at. 'Hopefully he will be available sooner rather than later.' Balotelli, laughing in the stands, has struggled to fill the void left by Sturridge's injury . Steven Gerrard celebrates scoring against Leicester during Liverpool's 2-1 win on Tuesday . While the debate continues over Steven Gerrard's future in light of the club's contract offer, which he has not yet accepted, Rodgers has to concern himself with the more immediate issue associated with the midfielder. Having previously admitted the 34-year-old cannot play three matches in a week, effectively the Reds boss has to decide whether to retain his captain in the starting line-up to face Sunderland on Saturday or hold him back for Tuesday's must-win Champions League tie at home to Basle, which is followed by a trip to Manchester United the following Sunday. 'The only focus is our next game but of course you are having to plan forward and look at one or two teams down the line,' said Rodgers, who this week had to quash reports there had been a disagreement between him and Gerrard. 'If you rest someone they are rotated, if they are rotated they are dropped, if he is dropped he is left out so you can't win as a manager. 'I'll always pick a team which I think can win the game.'

"Dave Whelan has undermined his chances of escaping censure from the Football Association after managing to cause further offence to the Chinese community in what appeared to be an attempt to apologise to the Jewish community. The Wigan chairman is already under investigation from the FA after an attempt to justify the appointment of Malky Mackay as his new manager – at a time when he too is under investigation by the FA for a series of racist, sexist and homophobic messages – by allegedly insulting both Jewish and Chinese people. In one interview last month he reportedly claimed that Jews ‘chase money’ while trying to defend Mackay’s use of the word ‘chink’. This time 78-year-old Whelan has referred to Chinese people as ‘chingalings’ in what is supposed to be an apology to the Jewish community via an interview with the Jewish Telegraph. The FA are aware of the remarks and are also looking into them. Dave Whelan (centre) faces another racism row after making comments about Chinese people . ‘When I was growing up we used to call the Chinese “chingalings”,’ he told the newspaper. ‘We weren’t being disrespected (sic). We used to say, ""We’re going to eat in chingalings"".' ‘The Chinese weren’t offended by that. That was the name everyone in Wigan called it [the first Chinese cafe in Wigan].’ Only on Thursday Whelan requested a further week to respond to an FA charge for his original comments. Whelan, who has said he will resign as Wigan chairman if he is found guilty of a breach of FA regulations, has to either accept the charge or contest it in the disciplinary hearing that will then follow. On the subject of his allegedly stereotypical statements about Jews, he told the Jewish Telegraph: ‘I apologise profusely to anyone who has taken offence because I would never offend the Jewish community under any circumstances. Whelan came under fire after appointing Malky Mackay (right), despite an FA investigation into the Scot . The Wigan chairman has until 6pm on Friday, December 12 to respond to his misconduct charge . ‘I have nothing but respect for them. They’re hard-working people, they’re honest people. They fight for what they believe in. ‘There’s nobody could knock the Jewish community. For them to accuse me of that, it hurts me a lot. ‘Never have I made anti-Jewish comments. ‘We have always, always respected what the Jewish people did, especially through the war. ‘We’ve always respected how those Jewish [people] stood up to every single thing they were put through, torture, horrendous. ‘And I have nothing but the highest regard and respect for the Jewish people.’ Matt Lawton’s exclusives in August led the way over Mackay, who has returned to management at Wigan . CLICK HERE to read more on the Cardiff racism storm, revealed by Sportsmail's chief sports reporter Matt Lawton. Whelan gave the interview, it is claimed, after a Manchester Jewish charity called off a fundraising breakfast he had been due to address later this month after donors threatened to withdraw support if the event went ahead. ‘Please take it I have a lot of Jewish friends,’ he said. ‘I bet there are a dozen who have got apartments in Majorca, where I am. ‘And so many Jewish people go to Barbados at Christmas. That’s when I go. I see a lot of them in the Lone Star, in restaurants. I play golf with a few of them. ‘I don’t want to mention any particular names because I don’t want to pull their names into it.’ Whelan, who made his fortune through his sports stores, also told the newspaper ‘two Jewish boys’ had taught him the market trading business.","Dave Whelan referred to Chinese as 'chingalings' during interview .

"Hull are under investigation by UEFA for possible breaches of financial fair play rules, it has been announced. The Tigers, who played in the qualifying rounds of the Europa League after finishing as runners-up in the FA Cup final, are among several new clubs who have had formal investigations into their finances opened by UEFA's club financial control body (CFCB). The clubs involved will have to submit further information to the CFCB but face no immediate sanctions. Hull City face an investigation by UEFA over a possible Financial Fair Play (FFP) breach . Hull, who are managed by Steve Bruce, are one of a number of clubs currently under investigation by UEFA . In October, Liverpool were one of seven clubs who were absent from European competition last year who had investigations for possible financial fair play (FFP) breaches opened against them. UEFA's rules dictate that losses must be restricted to £35.4m over a two-year window. Liverpool joined Monaco, Roma, Besiktas, Inter Milan, Krasnodar and Sporting Lisbon in being subjected to investigations relating to ""potential break-even breaches"" though the Reds are thought to be confident they will avoid any penalties.

"A 22-year-old glamour model dubbed France's Kim Kardashian has been arrested for allegedly trying to murder her boyfriend in a heated row. Swiss-born Nabilla Benattia was being held at Paris police station today after fellow reality TV star Thomas Vergara was stabbed repeatedly in the throat and chest. He was today in a ‘serious condition’ in the Georges Pompidou hospital in central Paris, while Ms Benattia was also treated for severe shock. Scroll down for video . Arrested: French reality star Nabilla Benattia, who has been dubbed the nation's answer to Kim Kardashian, was taken into custody after her boyfriend Thomas Vergara was stabbed repeatedly in the throat and chest . Wounded: Ms Benattia's boyfriend (pictured with her) was left in a serious condition in a Paris hospital . A police spokesman confirmed that Ms Benattia was being held ‘for suspected attempted murder’ and was being questioned at length. She was originally arrested for ‘assault and battery’ but the allegation was upgraded when prosecutors saw Mr Vergara’s wounds, said the spokesman. Officers were called to their hotel room in the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt at 2.30am after staff reported a ‘major argument with lots of screaming’. Ms Benattia, whose mother is Italian and father is Algerian, was arrested after firefighters got into the couple’s room. She is said to have raised the alarm by calling reception, saying that three men had attacked Mr Vergara outside the hotel. 'Incoherent': A police source said officers doubted the version of events given by the glamour model, pictured . Investigation: Mr Vergara has told police that he does not want to file charges against Ms Benattia (pictured) This version of events is disputed by staff and police, however, who say nothing was seen on CCTV, and there was no evidence of Mr Vergara’s blood outside the hotel. ‘Her version of events is incoherent’, said an investigating source. ‘It is not backed up by the initial evidence’. A knife is believed to have been thrown out of the hotel room window and had been wiped clean, said the source. Mr Vergara has told police that he does not want to file charges against Ms Benattia, although he may have to give evidence against her. Ms Benattia, who is thought to have denied any wrongdoing, can be held for up to 48 hours. The couple are household names in France after both appearing in the same TV show – ‘The Reality TV Angels’. Crime scene: The hotel where the stabbing took place in the Paris suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt at 2.30am . Its producer, Jeremy Michalak, said he was ‘in a state of shock’, adding: ‘I don’t know what happened. I’ve been trying to contact Nabilla.’ Ms Benattia, who has DD-sized breast implants, spent a month in detention as a minor over a fraud conviction in Switzerland. Last year she was arrested in France for allegedly spitting at a railway worker. Known popularly as ‘The Bimbo’, she has since launched her own short-lived reality TV show, featuring her family, as well as a line of clothes. She was voted the most disliked person in France in a survey conducted for Voici magazine last year. Her last public message, at 9.30pm yesterday, told her 1.1million Twitter followers in Arabic-French slang: 'I love you guys a lot I swear!!!'","Nabilla Benattia, 22, appeared in TV show alongside Thomas Vergara .

"Shamed CIA boss David Petraeus has spoken out for the first time since his affair with his biographer became public, forcing him to resign - and revealed he is determined to make his marriage work. Breaking his silence almost a week after he dramatically stepped down, Petraeus also revealed he has not spoken to his mistress, Paula Broadwell, since the scandal emerged and denied he had ever given her classified military documents. He maintained that his shock resignation on Friday had nothing to do with hearings about the terrorist attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi, which he was due to testify at this week. Instead, Petraeus, speaking with HLN reporter Kyra Phillips, said he stepped down as he was deeply remorseful about the affair and the only honourable thing left to do was to admit his failings. Scroll down for video . Speaking out: David Petraeus, whose affair with biographer Paula Broadwell led to his resignation last week, has said he is committed to making it work with his wife and acknowledges his mistake . And, relaying her conversations with Petraeus to HLN on . Thursday, Phillips said he was now focusing on repairing the damage inflicted on his family, including his two adult children, Anne and . Stephen. He admitted to . her that he had 'screwed up terribly' and that he 'felt fortunate to . have a wife who is far better than he deserves,' Phillips said. 'He knows he made a big mistake,' she said. 'He does . want to move forward making things work with his family. He doesn't want . to throw 37 years out the window with his wife.' 'This woman is strong,' she added of Holly Petraeus. 'She knows what she wants. She's . obviously, according to people that know her well, not happy about this . - very, very upset about this. Scandal: Petraeus and Paula Broadwell, pictured, conducted an affair from November 2011 until July 2012 - forcing his resignation when details were made public . Ladies man: General David Petraeus is pictured kissing Jill Kelley, who inadvertently exposed his affair . 'I do not know if she's committed to . working this out with Petraeus... But I . do know that Dave Petraeus does not want to throw 37 years away and . would really like to make this work and make things right with his . family.' Petraeus, 60, revealed . very little about his ten-month affair with Broadwell, . which ended in July, but said they had not spoken since Friday. 'They have not talked since this story . broke,' Phillips said. 'They talked a couple of times when he ended this relationship . which was a couple [of] months ago. But they have not talked since the . story broke.' These . previous conversations have been confirmed by sources who saw Petraeus . and Broadwell chatting at an intelligence event in Washington on October . 27, weeks after the start of the FBI probe. Found! Paula Broadwell was pictured on Tuesday night at her brother's home in Washington D.C., left, but there was no sign of her husband Scott, a radiologist with whom she has two young sons . Search: FBI agents remove computers and documents from Broadwell's home in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday. Petraeus has claimed he never gave her any classified military documents . In . a further twist to the scandal on Wednesday, it emerged that Broadwell, a married mother of two, . had admitted taking military documents from government buildings to her home. The revelations, which caused FBI . agents to swoop on her house in Charlotte, North Carolina on Monday night, added to fears that the . affair could have allowed a national security breach. But Phillips added: 'He . has insisted to me that he has never passed classified information to . Paula Broadwell. As long as I have known him, he has never wavered on . classified information, ever.' Phillips . added that Petraeus denied that the scandal was leaked in order to . allow him to step down before testifying about the September 11 attack . in Benghazi. 'He has said this has nothing to do with Benghazi and he wants to testify,' she said. 'He will testify.

A photo in June 2011 shows Broadwell watching as Petraeus and Holly arrive for a Senate Select Intelligence Committee hearing on Petraeus' nomination to be director of the CIA . 'He has maintained to me all along this was a personal failing... which, as I said, to me was quite stunning and to many other people... And so he has made it very clear that this was about an extramarital affair and not over classified information or Benghazi.' In the week since the affair emerged, . the scandal has implicated an increasing number of players, including a . top U.S. general whose job now hangs in the balance. Petraeus . and Broadwell, the author of his biography 'All In', met during his . 2006 visit to Harvard, where she was a research fellow, and they kept in . touch, eventually starting an affair as he took over the CIA in 2011. The . relationship came to light after Jill Kelley, who organised military . social events in Tampa, Florida, began receiving anonymous threatening . emails telling her to keep away from Petraeus. Implicated: Jill Kelley, a Florida socialite who organised military parties, reported threatening emails she was receiving from Broadwell to the FBI and during their investigation, the affair was discovered .

November 12 FBI searches Mrs Broadwell's home after she admits to storing military documents . Kelley, who became friends with Petraeus and his wife through her work with the military, reported the emails to the FBI, who traced the emails back to Broadwell. Some emails contained classified information about Petraeus' whereabouts that was not publicly available, so the FBI, believing there had been a security breach, launched an in-depth investigation into the sender of the messages. In the process of their investigation, they uncovered emails revealing Broadwell had conducted an affair with Petraeus and later, in October, interviewed both parties, who admitted to the affair. On November 6 - Election Day - the . FBI told Director of National Intelligence James Clapper about the probe . during a phone call. He then spoke with Petraeus and advised him to . resign. Two days later, . President Obama was told about the affair and Petraeus visited him at . the White House to hand in his resignation. Obama accepted Petraeus' resignation and he stepped down as the head of the CIA on November 9. The . scandal also dragged in another general, the U.S. Commander in . Afghanistan, General John Allen, as the FBI investigated Kelley's emails . from Broadwell. During the . probe, they reportedly uncovered 20,000 to 30,000 pages of email . correspondence between Allen and Kelley, both of whom are married with . children. While they both . deny any wrongdoing, officials have claimed some of the emails were . 'flirtatious' and another likened the contents to 'phone sex'. Allen, who will be promoted to NATO . supreme commander in Europe, remains in his position but the promotion . is on hold while the investigation continues. And in yet another odd twist, the FBI . agent Kelley initially contacted about the threatening emails, . Frederick W. Humphries II, was dismissed from the case after reportedly . becoming 'obsessed' with it. Involved: During the FBI's search, they also reportedly discovered thousands of 'inappropriate' and 'flirtatious' emails between Kelley and Gen.

He even sent Kelley a topless photograph of himself, but Humphries now insists he was never assigned to the case and the picture was simply a 'joke'. As the scandal seemed to engulf an increasing number of people connected to the military, Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has said he is 'unaware' of any more names of those involved. But in a memo, which does not explicitly name the scandal, he has asked the Joint Chiefs of Staff to review ethics training and to brainstorm on ways to steer officers away from trouble. His press secretary, George Little, said the memo was the product of internal Pentagon discussions that began before Petraeus announced he was resigning due to his affair.

"Southampton's midfield options are becoming stretched at just the wrong time, with Jack Cork facing at least six weeks on the sidelines. The 25-year-old will not play again this year after sustaining ankle ligament damage in Wednesday's late 1-0 defeat at Arsenal. Cork's absence compounds an increasingly tough situation for Saints in central midfield, with James Ward-Prowse and Morgan Schneiderlin also out of contention for Monday's match with Manchester United. Jack Cork (right) battles for possession with former Southampton team-mate Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain . Jack Cork suffered ankle ligament damage against Arsenal on Wednesday night . The midfielder (right) had to be substituted during the match and will miss the nest six weeks . Toby Alderweireld has helped fill the void in the past two matches but he is a doubt with a hamstring injury - hardly the ideal preparation for manager Ronald Koeman. 'I went to the training centre this morning about some updates of the players,' the Dutchman said ahead of his clash with compatriot Louis van Gaal. 'Jack Cork has ankle ligament (damage) and he will be out for maybe more than six weeks from what I heard from the doctor. 'Morgan Schneiderlin is doing well but he's not fit for Monday. 'Toby Alderweireld is positive. It's not really a hamstring injury, it's more fatigue in his muscle and he's doubtful for Monday. 'Maybe yes, maybe not, we have to wait, the game is on Monday and now we have two or three days more.' Toby Alderweireld (left) looks unlikely to play after being forced off with injury at Arsenal . Fellow midfielder Morgan Schneiderlin is also out of Monday's game with Manchester United . Dusan Tadic has been passed fit to face United, but Koeman will not be fast-tracking Ward-Prowse back from a fractured foot. That leaves Southampton struggling for numbers in central midfield, meaning 19-year-old Harrison Reed could make his first Premier League start alongside the likes of Victor Wanyama and Steven Davis. 'He is ready,' Koeman said. 'He's a young player and he has to develop himself, but always I'm a manager at a club who likes to have development of young players. That means also that you give chances to play. 'I didn't choose Harry when Schneiderlin went off in the game against City because of the level of competition, the physical strength in that game. Toby did it fantastic and the reason I did the same (against Arsenal when Cork went off). 'Harry played last Monday and young players need to play every week and he's an option for this Monday.'","Jack Cork has damaged ankle ligaments and will not play again this year .

"'Peter Pan Live' didn't exactly fly for NBC on Thursday night as just nine million viewers tuned in - less than half of the audience 'The Sound of Music' pulled in last year. The Nielsen company reported this year's musical production, starring Allison Williams as Peter Pan and Christopher Walken as Captain Hook, reached 9.1 million viewers. In comparison, 'The Sound of Music', which starred Carrie Underwood as Maria, reached 18.6 million viewers last year, compelling NBC to go back to work getting another musical on the air. Despite its high ratings, some performances last year were slammed by critics - including Underwood, who panned for her 'amateur' acting and Stephen Moyer, as Captain Georg Von Trapp, who was written off for 'clenched' singing. Scroll down for video . Head-to-head: Peter Pan Live, starring Allison Williams, left, pulled in 9.1 million viewers on Thursday night compared to last year's live version of The Sound of Music, starring Carrie Underwood, right . This year's performance attracted fewer viewers than a repeat of a 'Big Bang Theory' episode, which was watched by 10.7 million people during the first half-hour of 'Peter Pan Live'. They missed Williams, 26, enduring a wobbly start to the production as she almost crashed into a wall while attempting to impress Wendy with his magical flying powers. But the actress, who is better known for playing Marnie in the hit show Girls, recovered quickly, cushioning herself against the wall with her hand and shook off the minor mishap. The three-hour production also starred Christopher Walken as a charismatic Captain Hook - complete with tap-dancing and his inimitable swagger. But he was not without his mishaps either, as it appeared he was lip syncing some of the songs, while Gawker accused the whole cast of taking the fun out of the children's classic. Despite the low number of viewers, it appeared to be a hit among many who did tune in, with Today anchor Savannah Guthrie quipping on Friday: 'It was not Peter Pan-ned. Star performance: The 26-year-old Girls star received high praise from viewers on social media for her role as the 'boy who wouldn't grow up' in Thursday night's live show on NBC . We're Hooked: Veteran star Christopher Walken showed off tap-dancing skills with his band of pirates as Peter Pan's arch nemesis Captain Hook . On Twitter, one viewer, @joey_aulisio, wrote: 'Allison Williams killed it. Walken killed it. That wooden gator killed it. Tiger Lily - call me. THAT DOG! Great job everyone.' Another, @ryansatin, wrote: 'If you're not watching Walken as Hook, you are missing out on a truly special moment in TV history.' Girls co-star Lena Dunham tweeted: 'Allison is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst. She will slay.' Celebrity fans also offered their support. Katy Perry tweeted: 'I believe in you Allison Williams!' Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.' The NBC Nightly News host - the father of Allison Williams - took the night off anchoring duties to watch his daughter's performance from the wings. Mr Williams told TVNewser: 'We will be watching the broadcast - immediate family only - sequestered in an undisclosed location... close enough to the production as to burst through the stage door the moment the credits roll.' Alanna Saunders, a 22-year-old woman of Cherokee descent, was plucked from obscurity to play the starring role of Native American princess character Tiger Lily . Peter Pan with Wendy Darling and her brothers fly off to Neverland in the live telecast of the children's classic . However there were grumbles from viewers, as one Twitter user, @KittyKateMD, wrote: 'Although Allison Williams is singing beautiful, but her English accent is horrible! #PeterPanLive'. Another fired back: 'Chill with the hate people. Just be thankful its not as awful as Carrie Underwood in The Sound Of Music #PeterPanLive'. Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' But she added: 'Weird that the 'lost boys' are grown men.' Like The Sound Of Music, Peter Pan Live! wisely leaned on Broadway performers, including five-time Tony Award-nominee Kelli O'Hara, who was sadly underused, as Mrs Darling. The show also starred Jake Lucas (who was in Broadway show Newsies) as John Darling and a very good Taylor Louderman (Bring It On: The Musical) as Wendy. The beefy-armed Christian Borle, a Tony winner and veteran of last year's The Sound of Music Live!, played Mr Darling. (In a twist, Borle won his Tony playing Captain Hook in the Peter Pan play Peter and the Starcatcher.) Wendy Darling sings a romantic song expressing her unrequited love for Peter Pan in a performance which stayed true to JM Barrie's classic novel . Christopher Walken's Captain Hook character delighted viewers with his drawling dialogue and dancing . Borle, who also stars in NBC’s Smash, played two characters - the children’s strict dad Mr Darling as well as Hook’s right-hand pirate, Smee, a character he was far more successful at playing. But one of the stand-out performances came from the show’s second biggest star, Minnie Driver, despite only being seen onscreen for the last five minutes. Despite being the first voice we heard as the narrator throughout, Minnie came out at the very end to play Wendy Darling after she was all grown up - a mother who was still longing for Peter Pan’s return. Wendy's emotional moment at the end as Peter Pan finally returns - and she allows her daughter to follow him to Neverland - was one which moved many fans to tears. It was also a more culturally sensitive Peter Pan, with Alanna Saunders, a 22-year-old woman of Cherokee descent, portraying the Native American princess character Tiger Lily, and the offensive song Ugg-a-Wugg transformed into True Blood Brothers. However the biggest reaction went to a rather unexpected cast member - a crazy bright purple-and-blue crocodile, who tormenting Captain Hook and his pirates throughout. 'And the blue crocodile just broke Twitter,’ viewer Zach Brooks tweeted. Allison Williams' Girls co-star Lena Dunham tweeted: 'Allison is about to undertake one of the greatest drag roles in history and we are so proud we could burst. She will slay.' Katy Perry: 'I believe in you Allison Williams!' Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.' Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' Anna Kendrick went on stream of tweets as she watched. She posted: 'Dog is already the only character I care about #PeterPanLive. 'Tinkerbell sounds just like the iPhone alarm and these kids are still asleep? I don't buy it. #PeterPanLive' 'OH s***!!! Neverland is an acid trip and I never want get sober. #PeterPanLive' Sarah Silverman: 'There are only two women in #PeterPanLive and they're both Christopher Walken' Sarah Michelle Gellar: 'I wonder what next years live musical will be??

The show had its fair share of problems, including an early flying mishap for Williams while Walken was accused of bad lip syncing .

"More than 500 homes have been sold at an average cost of £320,000 as work continues on the world's largest eco-resort. With a footprint of 330 hectares, Funtasy Island will occupy six islands in the Riau Archipelago in Indonesia when it opens in late 2015. Located less than 10 miles from Singapore, the eco-resort will be accessible via a 20-minute luxury yacht or ferry ride. Funtasy Island in Indonesia is poised to become the world's largest eco-resort . A look at some of the properties at Funtasy Island, where more than 500 homes have been sold at an average cost £320,000 . Visitors will be able to interact with dolphins, stingrays and other marine life at Funtasy Island . The cost of building the eco-resort is around £154 million ($240 million). The average cost per square metre of property comes in at about £3,200 ($5,000). Surrounded by crystal clear waters, Funtasy Island will be home to a limited number of villas carefully designed to sit harmoniously with the unspoiled natural environment. Plans for the sprawling eco-resort include a dolphin discovery habitat, jungle expedition and boat ride . Located less than 10 miles from Singapore, the eco-resort will be accessible via a 20-minute luxury yacht or ferry ride . One million tourists are expected to visit the islands every year, with the number of houses projected at 1,200. In line with Indonesian property law, foreign investors can't buy their piece of paradise here as they can only lease it for set terms. However, after a 20- or 25-year lease, there is the option of a renewal. The average cost per square metre of property comes in at nearly £3,200, say developers . Developers say Funtasy Island will be unlike any other real estate development . Away from the private enclave of residences, there will be many specially designed spaces that offer worlds of fun dawn to dusk. The outgoing can enjoy nature trails, aquaculture, adventure and water sports, children and young at heart will be charmed by famous characters, and there will be shopping, dining and entertainment for everyone in the Wave Promenade. Despite the building work, 70 per cent of the islands will be preserved. The crystal clear waters surrounding Funtasy Island are home to an assortment of interesting sea creatures . Speaking to CNN, Funtasy Island Pte director Michael Yong said: 'It's already an impressive site but the property is just a start. 'Without that 70 per cent of the natural attractions, our island development will be just like any other or another real estate development.'","More than 500 homes have been sold at an average cost of £320,000 .

"A British family has received more than £23,000 in compensation from a tour operator after their Tunisian holiday was ruined when each of them fell ill with ‘horrendous’ gastric symptoms. Christopher Sheldon, his wife, Amanda, and their 26-year-old son, Daniel, all suffered stomach cramps, diarrhoea, vomiting, fever and headaches during their two-week stay at the Caribbean World Borj Cedria hotel, southeast of Tunis, in October 2011. Amanda, 45, was diagnosed with gastroenteritis and is still suffering from gastric-related symptoms, although her husband and son have both made a full recovery. Compensation: The Sheldon family fell ill while staying at a Caribbean World Resort in Tunisia . Amanda Sheldon still suffers from symptoms three years after the nightmare holiday . Christopher, 47, told MailOnline Travel: ‘She’s still quite bad. She came back with a very bad case of gastroenteritis and every now and again she’s still really bad with it. ‘This has just really sort of rocked her.’ In their claim, the family, from Ashington, Northumberland, complained about unsanitary conditions in the three-star resort’s restaurant. They said chicken was undercooked, food was served on damaged and dirty crockery on occasion, and uncovered and reheated food was left out for long periods of time. They also claim to have seen cats roaming free in the restaurant. The family fell ill just a few days into their two-week stay at Caribbean World Borj Cedria in October 2011 . Christopher, formerly a manager in the food and drink industry, said: ‘We were appalled by the state of the restaurant when we arrived and it isn’t something I expected from a three-star resort, it was disgusting. ‘We even overheard staff at one point saying that they would not eat in the restaurant. ‘We all fell ill with horrendous symptoms a few days into the holiday. This meant that we were not able to go on any excursions or explore the local area as we had hoped because we had to stay at the hotel as we felt too ill to travel. ‘My wife is still suffering with stomach issues which she finds very uncomfortable and at times embarrassing. We did not expect our annual holiday to turn out the way it did. ‘We are pleased that our legal battle is now over and feel like we can finally move on from our ordeal.’ The Sheldons say their 'horrendous' symptoms prevented them from going on excursions . The Sheldons, who booked online with Sunsave Travel Limited, hired solicitors from Irwin Mitchell to pursue a claim against the Bradford-based tour operator. Irwin Mitchell said Sunsave Travel Limited denied any liability and a £23,600 settlement was reached after it issued court proceedings. Nichola Blackburn, a legal specialist with Irwin Mitchell’s international personal injury team said: ‘What was supposed to be a lovely family holiday with their son became ruined by illness. The family saved up hard for their trip and it ended up being one they will never forget, for all the wrong reasons. ‘Sunsave Travel Limited denied liability, Court proceedings were therefore issued. ‘We are pleased that a settlement has been agreed that reflects the illness each family member endured while at the hotel, and also takes into account the on-going altered bowel habits Amanda faces as a result of the holiday.’ MailOnline Travel has contacted Sunsave Travel Limited for comment.","The Sheldon family suffered 'horrendous' symptoms on two-week trip .

"After another appearance as an emergency centre back at West Ham in March, Michael Carrick was asked about the role he has filled all too frequently for Manchester United over the years. ‘You have to adapt,’ said the England midfielder. ‘There are different jobs to do in certain games, different formations that you have to adapt to. That is not something that bothers me. I could do without centre-half at times, especially against Andy Carroll, but that is something you have to live with.’ Still, Carrick could hardly have expected to be back at the heart of United’s defence in his first game under Louis van Gaal in last weekend’s Manchester derby. Michael Carrick (right) could play the rest of the season at the heart of Manchester United's defence . Louis van Gaal's defensive injury woes forced the Dutchman to bring on Carrick at centre back on Sunday . Here is how United finished their 1-0 derby defeat against City at the back... Antonio Valencia (winger) Michael Carrick (midfielder) Paddy McNair (a kid) Luke Shaw (a prospect but a rookie) Fit again after ankle surgery in the summer, Carrick came off the bench just before half-time at the Etihad to fill in once again when Chris Smalling was sent off for a second booking. He finished the game playing alongside teenager Paddy McNair after Marcos Rojo was stretchered off with a dislocated shoulder. Van Gaal may be forced to start with the same unlikely partnership at home to Crystal Palace on Saturday, although he also has the option of Tyler Blackett. With Rojo joining Jonny Evans (ankle) and Phil Jones (shin splints) on the sidelines, however, Carrick is preparing to drop into defence once again. ‘If I need to play there then fine,’ he said this week. ‘I have not had a lot of football recently so I will play anywhere. ‘It’s not somewhere I have played an awful lot of games. I have had spells of playing there over the years, playing two or three or four games in a season. But I don’t mind.’ Paddy McNair (left) and Luke Shaw (right) were part of United's makeshift defence against City on Sunday . The England international looked assured at the back as United lost 1-0 to rivals Manchester City . Nemanja Vidic was deemed past his sell-by date at Old Trafford but is now playing in Serie A for Inter Milan . United’s injury problems in defence this season have raised questions over Van Gaal’s decision not to bring in a specialised centre-back in the summer despite losing Nemanja Vidic and Rio Ferdinand and spending more than £150million on new players. The latest names to be linked with a move to Old Trafford are Ron Vlaar of Aston Villa and FC Porto’s £10m-rated Bruno Martins Indi, but Van Gaal’s hands are tied until the January transfer window opens in nearly two months’ time. It means that this may not be the last time that Carrick is pressed into duty as an emergency defender by the Dutchman, and the 33-year-old’s track record in that position suggests that it represents something of a gamble. He impressed in the 2-0 win at Upton Park in March, having previously played next to Evans in a 5-0 win over Wigan in 2011 and in a back-three alongside Patrice Evra and Darren Fletcher during a 3-1 Champions League win over Wolfsburg two years earlier. Chris Smalling was shown a second yellow card for this challenge on James Milner and will now be suspended . United's spending included a summer buy on defender Marcos Rojo who is now out with a dislocated shoulder . In fact, last summer Gary Neville suggested that Carrick would be an ideal candidate if Van Gaal was to persevere with the three-man defensive system he has long since discarded. But more often than not it has been an awkward fit. Many fans will remember Carrick being outjumped by Marouane Fellaini for Everton’s winning goal on the opening weekend of the 2012-13 season after he was forced to fill in for the injured Ferdinand at Goodison Park. Subsequent appearances as a centre back alongside Evans against Braga and then Vidic against Fulham that season proved little better, even though United recovered to win 3-2 on both occasions. Winger Antonio Valencia (right) started the Manchester derby at right back for United . Carrick is no stranger to having to fill in at centre back for the Old Trafford club . Prior to that, Carrick was at fault for one of Blackburn’s goals as United suffered a shock 3-2 defeat to the Premier League’s bottom club on New Year’s Eve in 2011, and was also part of a back-three alongside Fletcher and Ritchie De Laet that was taken apart in a 3-0 defeat at Fulham in 2009. There could be no blame attached to his performance at the Etihad last week as 10-man United came close to salvaging a draw after falling behind to Sergio Aguero’s strike. But as a gifted player known more for his passing technique than his tenacity faces the prospect of another spell in defence, Carrick has more reason than most to bemoan United’s baffling injury problems under Van Gaal.

"A 16-year-old tennis star was left with blood streaming down her face after her father hit her in the face for losing a match.

Umpires called the police after Ioana Andrada Surdeanu, a Romanian junior player, was slapped by her father . Defending Lucian Surdeanu, her father, the tennis player said it was normal for him to 'punish' her after matches, usually by taking her phone. She said: 'I didn't play well in that match. At the end, he went to confiscate my phone. That's the way he punishes me when it is my fault and I don't win matches. I was annoyed and I threw the phone at him and said ""take it"". 'Of course he didn't catch it, and he got angry because of the way I've behaved. He pushed me and slapped me twice. One of the slaps hit my nose. 'I sat down on my knees, and I put my hands on my face so he would not be able to hit me again. I had a little blood, I was scared and shaking. 'He gave me a wet towel and said that I should go to the tournament's doctor. When I came back, he was already kicked out from the tennis court and they told me he had been sent to the hotel.' 'By the time I got to the hotel, they had already arrested him. The umpires took me to the police station. On our way, we stopped near a police car. It had bars on the back seat and when I looked inside I saw my dad.' Miss Surdeanu, who had reached the quarter final of the International Tennis Federation Tournament, screamed when her father, Lucian, hit her . Miss Surdeanu defended her father, saying she 'deserved' to be punished after her defeat . Mr Surdeanu was given a £237 fine for hitting his daughter and has reportedly returned home . Despite needing treatment from a doctor to stem the blood pouring from her nose, Miss Surdeanu, ranked 249th in the world, tearfully defended her father. 'At the police station they didn't let me see him, like he was dangerous and I had to stay away from him. 'My father is not a beast, he didn't break my nose, I didn't have my face covered in blood. It's true, he slapped me. But so what? I deserved it. 'It was my fault because I've yelled and said some bad words to him. I was irresponsible after all the sacrifices he made for me. I admit that I was scared in that moment he hit me, but I know he regrets what he did and he loves me as much as I love him. 'He maybe exaggerated a little, but he didn't deserve to be arrested. I'm worried for him. I want to continue this journey in tennis with the support of the whole family. 'When I read that he is described as a ""criminal"" and a ""beast"", I feel like I want to scream. I feel guilty for what is happening.' Mr Surdeanu was given a £237 fine and has reportedly returned home to Romania.

He took them to the courts when they were just four years old, later realising that he should have waited until they were at least six. He says the motto he drilled into them from an early age was:  ‘You got to be rough, you’ve got to be tough and you’ve got to be strong.' 2) John Tomic, the father and coach of Bernard Tomic, headbutted his son's hitting partner, breaking the player's nose after a row on a training court in Madrid. Despite this, he said: 'I don't feel guilty, I didn't do anything wrong.' 3) Damir Dokic, father of Jelena Dokic, bizarrely threatened to assassinate the Australian ambassador to Serbia and was ejected from Wimbledon in 2000 for breaking a journalist's camera. The father of the tennis star also hit the headlines after saying he would kill himself if his daughter was a lesbian. 4) Jim Pierce, father of retired player Mary Pierce, shouted at her daughter to 'kill the b****' during a tournament. In 1993, Ms Pierce obtained a restraining order from her father, who had verbally abused her. His outbursts were so bad that he was eventually banned from Women's Tennis Association matches. 5) Croatian player Mirjana Lucic said she left her home with her mother and four siblings to escape her abusive father Marinko. He told the Telegraph: 'I never used excessive force, and if I did give her the occasional slap, it was because of her behaviour; I did what I believed what was best for the child.'

"Paul Scholes believes Barcelona are a 'ghost' of the side they once were and Lionel Messi is bored having won everything club football has to offer. The former Manchester United midfielder says Barca manager Luis Enrique has a tough task on his hands trying to motivate a team who have 'won it all and conquered the world.' Scholes attended Barcelona's La Liga match at Valencia last weekend and concluded from their below-par performance that 'something is missing.' Lionel Messi is 'bored' having won everything with Barcelona, according to Paul Scholes . Messi lifts the European Cup for the third time after Barcelona beat Manchester United in the 2011 final . Scholes and Messi go toe-to-toe in the 2008 Champions League semi-final at Old Trafford . Writing in his Independent column, Scholes said: 'When I try to find a way of summarising the attitude of the team, and of some longer-serving individuals, I keep alighting on the word ""bored"". 'It is not meant to sound flippant, but it just seems the most accurate way to describe the way the team seem to treat the style of football that once made them the best side on the planet.' Scholes claims that Messi, who has won six La Liga titles, two Copa del Reys and three Champions League titles, is struggling to keep himself motivated. He writes: 'As for Messi, his achievements put him in a different category to the rest of us who played the game. But even so, in him, as much as anyone, I detected that mood of boredom.

'He has never been a player given to chasing the full back when his team lose the ball, but now, more than ever, he keeps his movement to an absolute minimum. 'For a young manager like Luis Enrique, it will be hard to change the way Messi, and the rest of the stars in this team, play the game. They have won it all. They have conquered the world.

"Princess Juliana International Airport in Saint Martin is often referred to as having one of the world's most frightening airport runways. And these holidaymakers who were enjoying a day at the beach in the Caribbean certainly found out why. The airport, while being the second-busiest airport in the Eastern Caribbean, has a runway of just 7,152 feet in length - and it is located right next to the beach. Princess Juliana International Airport in Saint Martin is known to have the world's scariest runway . Tourists can stand right against the fence along the runway's perimeter, across the street from a local beach . Though sufficient for small or medium-sized jets, large carriers fly extremely low over the nearby beach, often only just clearing the perimeter's fence. The video begins as the plane prepares to take off and sunbathers emerge from the water at Maho Beach for a closer look at the JetBlue Airbus A321. The video begins with three brave individuals attempting to hold on as the plane accelerates . Unfortunately, one tourist cannot withstand the blast and is catapulted backwards toward a concrete path . The woman landed headfirst against the beach's wall as passersby raced to her side to help . Several daredevils are then seen holding onto the wire fence that separates the airport runway from the local sandy beach. As the plane begins to accelerate, the sand and dirt kicks up, causing a literal whirlwind among the several brave tourists who are attempting to hang on. Just a second later, one of the remaining two still holding onto the wall is blasted into the air, away from the fence and into a concrete footpath just feet from the fence itself.","Passersby in Saint Martin attempt to hold onto fence while jet accelerates .

"With a 354-foot replica of the Eiffel Tower at the centre, the vegetable gardens in the Chinese town of Tianducheng may be the world's most elaborate allotment. Where greens and radishes grow were supposed to be the beautifully manicured gardens of a development built to be just like Paris. But those plans were abandoned when developers ran out of money and the garden became overgrown and unsightly. Scroll down for video . A 354-foot replica of the Eiffel Tower stands at the centre of the failed Paris copycat development in the Chinese town of Tianducheng . Manicured gardens were supposed to beautify the town but locals have instead created vegetable gardens at the foot of the attraction . The few residents who remain in Tianducheng are happy with the gardens say it's better than having weeds taking over the space . Sensing an opportunity locals have stepped in to make the most of the space and now their vegetables are flourishing in the shadow of the bizarre landmark. Tianducheng, in the city of Hangzhou in the east China province of Zhejiang, opened with great fanfare in 2007 with Parisian-style houses and its own Arc de Triomphe. Its one-third scale Eiffel Tower (the real one is 1,063 feet) looks remarkably realistic, but wasn't enough to entice the 10,000 residents developers hoped for. Just 2,000 moved in and local media refer to it as a ghost town. With the tower starting to rust and a lift to the top never coming to fruition, the few residents who remain are largely happy about the vegetable plots saying they are more appealing than weeds. Tianducheng opened with great fanfare in 2007 but fell substantially short of their 10,000 resident target . Developers ran out of money and have failed the complete the project, which is now largely farmland and abandoned residential towers . The developers blame Tianducheng's location for its failure. Copycat towns are no new concept in China, with Italian city of Venice recreated in the port city of Dalian in China's north-eastern Liaoning province. The World Heritage-listed Austrian Alps village of Hallstatt has also been mimicked in Guangdong province, much to the disapproval of those from the original.","Tianducheng was built to resemble Paris with its own 354-foot Eiffel Tower .

"A notorious former strip club has been transformed into a luxury boutique hotel in Rhode Island, US. Built around the history and culture of Providence, The Dean is a hotel that values collaboration with its neighbours. Filled with custom furniture, craftwork from local purveyors and found objects from Europe and beyond, The Dean revels in the details. But just three years ago the building was in disrepair - once used as a brothel and strip club, designer and developer Ari Heckman decided to breatehe new life into the dilapidated eyesore. Designer and developer Ari Heckman has utilised original themes from the strip club in a fascinating new look . The bar where ladies would dance and entertain the crowds is now a chillout area - but notice the drawing on the wall and a hark back in time . The tired and tacky green shutters have been ripped off, and the exterior of the hotel looks fresh and inviting to the tourism industry . Built in 1912, the building was originally meant to house the clergy, but by the time Great Depression came around, it became a shelter for the poor and impoverished. Then, as theatre took over the downtown Providence area, the building became a pit-stop for actors and actresses. But then the area fell into decline, and it became a strip club, with 60 hourly rooms upstairs. The renovation works took two-and-a-half years to complete, and now the building has had a much-needed focus . The Dean is filled with custom furniture, craftwork from local purveyors and found objects from Europe and beyond . The exit door to the old strip club - girls would have come and gone through here, earning their living while entertaining their 'clients' Interestingly, the shapes from the old strip club have been incorporated into the hotel's fresh and clean design . Ari Heckman used to walk past the strip club, and once it had shut down, he seized upon the opportunity for his next project . These rooms are a far cry to what was there before, where strippers used to entertain their clients, with the furniture of high standard . The bathrooms in the rooms at The Dean are beautifully designed and add a real touch of class to the building, and right, the bright walkways . Built around the history and culture of Providence, The Dean is a hotel that values collaboration with its neighbours and really stands out . Speaking to Curbed.com, Mr Heckman said: 'It was in that condition up until the moment we bought it. I went to the building on the last day of its active strip club life. The next day,the lights were off and that was the end of that.' 'There were definitely moments of panic, where it felt highly unrealistic that we would be able to make something out of that. 'There was nothing good happening in those rooms. They did everything wrong to make the space feel as disturbing as possible.' Fast forward two-and-a-half years and the refub is complete - rooms are eloquently designed with decor from New England and Belgium, while working with the original layout of the building and structure. There is a restaurant, a coffee shop, a bar, and a karaoke lounge, as well as 52 beautifully-designed bedroom suites. Certain themes from its past remain, for example there is an artistic drawing of a naked woman on the walls of the bar.","After walking past the shut-down strip club on numerous occasions, designer Ari Heckman bought building .

"Crystal Palace have completed the permanent signing of academy product Wilfried Zaha from Manchester United for a fee of £6million. Despite initially jumping the gun by announcing the deal before United believed the finer details had been finalised - which saw the south Londoners then quickly remove the confirmation from their official website, the club confirmed the deal later on Monday evening. Zaha left Selhurst Park in 2013, joining Manchester United for £15million, but has since returned to the club on loan after failing to impress at Old Trafford.

He tweeted: 'Glad to be back permanently and appreciate all the messages #CPFC #home' Zaha, tipped as one of English football's brightest prospects at the time, was signed under former Man United boss Sir Alex Ferguson in January 2013. But the terms of the transfer saw him loaned straight back to the Eagles for the remainder of the season and he did not arrive at Old Trafford until the summer, by which time Ferguson had retired and been replaced by David Moyes. During a disastrous campaign for the club under Moyes, Zaha made just four United appearances before playing out the second half of last season at Cardiff. However, Zaha is rejuvenated back at Palace and manager Alan Pardew has decided to keep the talented winger, as he doesn't fall into Louis van Gaal's United plans. Zaha cost United £15million, but the £6million fee back to Crystal Palace is significantly less .

"La Paz is now officially home to both the longest and highest urban cable car network in the world. The six-mile 'green line' transit system connects the Bolivian capital with its twin city, El Alto. It is the last of three cable car lines to be installed above the city, which is located 13,600ft, making it one of the world's largest urban cable car systems, with more than six miles of lines, 11 stations and 74 towers in total. As of December 4, La Paz, Bolivia, is now home to the highest urban cable car route in the world . On hand to inaugurate the third line of the Mi Teleferico system was President of Bolivia, Evo Morales. The latest opening comes after the cable car network launched with a red line in June, carrying more than three million passengers over the past months. In September, the yellow line opened with 169 cars and four stations in total. On hand to inaugurate the opening of the third line of Mi Teleferico was President Morales . The third line - green, to complete the colours of the Bolivian flag - marks the completion of the first phase of Mi Teleferico. At the ceremony, President Morales spoke about the modernisation project, made possible due to the country's recent period of economic and political stability. According to Tele Sur, Morales said: 'These kinds of large works can only be carried out when there is economic stability. Morales spoke about the project, which is only possible due to the country's recent period of stability . The city has guaranteed an additional $450 million to the project, which will eventually encompass 5 lines . Though the network had been proposed by previous governments, it had never gotten off the ground . 'When there is social stability, this guarantees political stability, and this political stability also guarantees economic stability, including economic growth. 'We have four hundred and fifty million dollars guaranteed for the new five lines of cable cars in La Paz.' The project, which travels high above the mountainous south side, had been proposed by previous governments but never carried out. La Paz is officially the highest capital city in the world with altitudes as high as 12,000 feet (3,650 metres) above sea level, where traditional forms of transportation such as trains would be expensive to construct.","System's third 'green line' went into service officially on December 4 .

"A naked body scanner previously used at airports in both the US and UK has been put up for sale on eBay for $7,995 (£5,100). The US seller has listed a Rapiscan Secure 1000 SP (Single Pose) Backscatter Body Scanner X-Ray on the website. The scanner model was used at airports across America until last year and also trialed at Manchester Airport in the UK. The X-ray scanner, used in airports, is on sale on eBay for a bargain $7,995 (£5,100) It's not an easy shipment, with the body scanner coming in three packages . The US Transport Safety Administration discarded the controversial model last year over privacy fears about the detailed images it showed on screen and Manchester also stopped using the scanners, while London's Heathrow Airport uses millimetre wave-based scanners. However, they are still in use to check for hidden weapons at airports across Africa, including popular holiday spots Kenya and Tanzania, as well as at courthouses and prisons in the US. The scanner is said by the user to cost around $113,000 (£73,000) at full price and is packaged in three crates. The seller writes in the description that they 'sell government surplus' equipment, and that anyone interested is welcome to go along and 'inspect'. The description continues: 'The Secure 1000 bounces very low dose of x-rays off of a person to generate an image. This image is then analyzed by an operator to identify concealed potential threats. 'Front and Back Scanning for Comprehensive Threat Detection: The Secure 1000 SP generates a front and back scan simultaneously, which eliminates blind spots and potential opportunities for concealment, thereby increasing checkpoint security.' The scanner, used in airports throughout the world, could be a fixture in someone's home . The scanner is being sold by a user who deals in 'government surplus,' and has a 100 per cent rating . Sadly for any worldwide interest, the ebay user cannot ship the item out of the US . Airport bodyscanners are used to detect hidden weapons, although some scientists claim the Rapiscan model could be tricked to miss guns and C-4 explosives. The TSA spent a reported £1billion dollars installing the Rapiscan body scanners at airports, but they were eventually discarded due to privacy concerns and replaced with millimeter wave scanners. The item for sale is based in Chattanooga, Tennessee, US, and unfortunately to anyone overseas, will only be shipped locally. Used at airport to check for knives, explosives, concealed liquids and narcotics, you could be the envy of all your friends with this security machine.

"Nothing evokes a sense of place like the heady waft of a familiar smell. And passengers travelling from Heathrow's Terminal 2 can now be transported to across the world in a single sniff. To celebrate the completion of its newly reinvigorated terminal, the airport has installed a 'scent globe' which shoots out the smell of its most fragrant destinations, intending to 'take passengers on a sensory journey before even setting foot on their flights'. Smell you later: Passengers travelling from Heathrow's Terminal 2 can experience the new scent globe . Perched in the departure lounge, the orb offers curious globetrotters whiffs of Thailand, South Africa, Japan, China and Brazil. The selection were chosen for their popularity with Heathrow air passengers. To conjure up the essence of the five nations, Heathrow worked with Design in Scent, to produce tailor-made scents from ingredients associated with the designated country. South Africa's smell captures the adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense, wild grass and musky animalics through the scent of Hyraceum (a rock like substance made from the excrement of the Cape hyrax). While Brazil's scent oozes rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee, tobacco and jasmine. While some destinations have smells travellers would rather forget, here are Heathrow's interpretations of the following heaven-scented locations: . South Africa - The adventure of safari with notes of tribal incense, wild grass and musky animalics . Japan - Cool, oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts, green tea and Ambergris . China -  Mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower create an orient explosion . Thailand -  An appetising mix of lemongrass, ginger and coconut . Brazil -  Rich rainforest fauna with a palette of coffee, tobacco and jasmine . A  staff member enjoys a whiff of the scent globe, which shoots out the aromas of five different countries . Japan is brought to life through cool, oceanic tones with a mix of seaweed and shell extracts, green tea and Ambergris, capturing the essence of coastal villages synonymous with the great Pacific Island. According to the Heathrow Airport website: 'China's mystical temple incense and subtle Osmanthus Fragrans flower create an orient explosion' and 'Thailand tantalises the taste buds with an appetising mix of lemongrass, ginger and coconut'. Normand Boivin, Chief Operating Officer at the airport said: 'Heathrow connects the UK to 180 destinations in 28 countries and carries over 72 million passengers a year. T2: The newly renovated terminal, which opened in June, is now operating at full capacity . 'Heathrow is the UK's hub airport; mixing direct passengers, transfers and freight to make long haul flights viable. We strive to offer a unique experience that delights our passengers.'

"The distraught families of two British hostages beheaded at the hands of ISIS fanatics today came together in show of unity at a memorial service for one of the murdered men. In a symbol of solidarity, Alan Henning's anguished wife and daughter linked armed with the family of David Haines as they attended the private memorial in honour of Mr Henning. The 47-year-old taxi driver was beheaded by the British Islamtic State terrorist dubbed 'jihadi John' in a gruesome video released last month while on a second aid convoy to Syria to help refugees. Scroll down for video . Barbara Henning (second from right) and her daughter Lucy (right) linked arms with Bethany (left) and Mike Haines (second from left) as they attended a memorial service to pay tribute to Alan Henning . In a show of solidarity, the two grieving families attended the service in Eccles, Greater Manchester . Father-of-two David Haines, who spent two decades protecting innocent civilians across the Third World, was also beheaded in September in a similarly disturbing video. Before the service earlier today, Barbara and Lucy Henning walked into Eccles Parish Church, Greater Manchester, alongside Bethany and Michael Haines, Mr Haines's daughter and brother. They were joined by dozens of mourners who donned vibrant yellow colours - a poignant reminder of the yellow ribbons which filled Mr Henning's hometown when it was believed the father would return home. After the service, the family unveiled a memorial plaque at the church bearing her husband's name and the words 'Our Hero'. Speaking at the service, which was held in lieu of his funeral, Mrs Henning told how her beloved husband had been killed for being 'selfless and caring'. Mrs Henning (left) told the service that her husband had died for being 'selfless and caring' but that she knew he would live on through their children Lucy and Adam (right) The service was attended by mourners who wore yellow scarves, in a poignant reminder of the yellow ribbons which flooded Eccles when it was hoped Mr Henning might return home . Others pinned yellow ribbons to their clothes as they attended the service, which was held instead of a funeral . Some mourners arrived wearing yellow roses to remember the 47-year-old aid worker and taxi driver . Crowds of local people gathered near the church to listen to the service, as it was played out on speakers . She also condemned his killers for using the banner of religion as an excuse to carry out their despicable crimes. She said: 'We must never forget the reason why he went to Syria and the reason he was taken from us - for being what we all should be, selfless and caring.' She added: 'These people are hiding behind a peaceful religion to carry out their crimes against humanity. 'We know this because we have seen the outcry from Muslims across the globe, condemning their behaviour. Mrs Henning (left) lays flower at a memorial plaque (right) unveiled at the church of her 'hero' husband . His two children Lucy and Adam joined their mother in laying the yellow flowers upon the stone . There was also a floral tribute to Mr Henning, spelling out the word 'hero' in yellow blooms . 'I only hope that we can bring these people to justice or that they receive the justice they deserve in the next life. No god would ever condone the killing of innocent people.' Mrs Henning also paid tribute to the families of the other four hostages who are also believed to have been murdered by jihadi John: John Foley, Steven Sotloff, Mr Haines and Peter Kassig. She added that she 'hoped and prayed' that hostage John Cantlie, a photojournalist seized by militants in 2012, would be released and returned to his family 'so that they are spared the horror'. The 43-year-old has appeared in a series of propoganda videos in which he is dressed in a Guantanamo-style orange jumpsuit and delivers messages, in the style of a news reader, to Western governments. Mr Henning, 47, was beheaded by British terrorist dubbed 'jihadi John' in a gruesome video released online last month during his second aid convoy to Syria where he travelled to help refugees . The service heard how Mr Henning had a brilliant sense of humour and had died because he was 'selfless and caring' In a video published last night, Mr Cantlie said he accepted 'long ago' that his fate is 'overwhelmingly likely' to be the same as his 'cellmates'. Mrs Henning also thanked those who had sent words on comfort in the aftermath of the tragedy. She said she had taken courage from those who had told her that her husband would live through their two teenage children and any grandchildren she will one day have. She also revealed the her 'loving, witty and caring' husband was a great joker and a terrible snorer. She told how, at the wedding of his nephew, where he was best man, Mr Henning produced two Hula Hoops instead of the rings. Rev Cyprian Yobera led the service, which is being held instead of a funeral for Mr Henning . David Haines, 44, was killed by IS militants in Syria  after spending more than a year as a hostage . Mrs Henning asked for donations to be made to Hostage UK, a charity which helps the families of kidnap victims. In a statement she released before the memorial, Mrs Henning said her children may never understand why their father was taken from them. She said: 'Alan was a peaceful, selfless man who left his family in the UK at Christmas 2013 to drive in a convoy all the way to Syria with his Muslim colleagues and friends to help those most in need. We, as a family, are extremely proud of him. 'Lucy and Adam understood why he had to go, he had explained to them how he had seen children with nothing, living in tents and queuing for food and water, and how much harder it was for them in the middle of winter. 'Some of these children had lost their entire families, killed by their own country's leadership. 'On behalf of the entire family, I want to thank everyone who campaigned for Alan's release, who held vigils to pray for his safe return and who condemned those who took him. 'Your efforts were a great support to us and we take comfort in knowing how many people stood beside us in hoping for the best.'","Barbara Henning and her two children attended service for Mr Henning, 47 .

"Louis van Gaal hit out at his Manchester United players after watching them crumble to an embarrassing 5-3 defeat to Leicester. United raced into a 3-1 lead thanks to goals from Robin van Persie, Ander Herrera and Angel di Maria, who chipped Kasper Schmeichel with a delightful goal in the 16th minute before Leonardo Ulloa banged in a header. Marcos Rojo missed a clear header from four yards and full debutant Radamel Falcao struck the bar, but Van Gaal's team then went to pieces. Louis van Gaal and Ryan Giggs appear in shock after United's capitulation against Leicester . United players celebrate Ander Herrera's goal as the visitors raced to a 3-1 lead at the King Power Stadium . Jamie Vardy and Estebian Cambiasso found the net after some terrible defending while David Nugent and Ulloa also scored penalties to seal the Foxes' first home win over the Red Devils in 29 years. After enjoying such a comprehensive win over QPR last week, Van Gaal found the defeat at the King Power Stadium hard to take. 'We start last match against QPR very good with a new team, new players and then we played very well here, but we gave the game away,' the United manager said. 'Leicester had five shots on goal, and that was it. 'These five goals were existing because we made errors in ball possession. 'We created a lot of chances and made superb goals but you have to do that over 90 minutes, not 60 minutes. It was not enough today. 'You have to kill the game and we didn't do that.' Angel di Maria scored a contender for goal of the season with United's second strike of the game . At times in the first half, United were simply irresistible. Argentinian duo Rojo and Di Maria looked dangerous down the left flank while Falcao, Van Persie and Wayne Rooney looked a devastating front three. But in defence, United's concentration and marking was easily exposed by the Premier League newcomers. Eyebrows were raised when Van Gaal decided to not to spend any of his vast budget on a centre-half this summer, and it is easy to see why after this display. Chris Smalling, who came on for the injured Jonny Evans in the first half, was easily bullied by Leicester's front three. Rafael (C) and Wayne Rooney (R) argue with referee Mark Clattenburg after he Tyler Blackett was sent off . Tyler Blackett, one of only three players to start every game for United this year, was sent off when he hacked down Vardy to hand Leicester their second penalty while Rafael was at fault for the first spot-kick when he barged over the former Fleetwood man. United lacked the energy to mount a comeback late on as Van Gaal was forced to withdraw Falcao and Di Maria through fatigue. 'I had to change Falcao, not because he was bad - he played very well - but because I have to build (his fitness) up. That is my problem,' Van Gaal said. 'Di Maria also had a problem.' Radamel Falcao was taken off on his first start for United as the Colombian striker works towards full fitness . Van Gaal refused to criticise referee Mark Clattenburg for awarding the penalty against Rafael even though the Brazilian was fouled by Vardy in the build up. 'It was only 3-2 at the time, that was not a problem,' he said. 'The problem was we did not keep ball possession.' Van Gaal, who is already without Phil Jones because of a hamstring tear, may now be without Evans for a while. The Northern Ireland centre-half left the stadium on crutches after injuring his foot in a tackle with Ulloa. Defender Jonny Evans added to United's injury list after leaving the stadium on crutches . 'I don't know how bad it is,' Van Gaal said. 'We will see tomorrow, he will probably have a scan.' Van Gaal's opposite number Nigel Pearson lauded his players after their historic win. The Leicester boss reserved special praise for Cambiasso, who starred on his first start since moving to the Midlands club on a free transfer from Inter Milan. Pearson said: 'He had a very profound influence on the game. 'It's never easy for a player with such high expectations on him to come in against a side like Manchester United and run the show. Leicester manager Nigel Pearson (R) has praised the performance of new signing Esteban Cambiasso . 'Before today he had played 45 minutes of competitive football for us. 'He brings know-how, experience and quality.' Three years ago Vardy was playing his football in the Conference, but despite his amazing journey, he is in no mood to rest on his laurels. He said: 'It's massive. Obviously, it's not been an easy journey to come here, and now we are at the top, but it's all about staying here now. 'We managed to get three points today and that moves us up the table a bit.'","Manchester United were beaten 5-3 by Leicester in Premier League clash .

The move made the bridge a popular tourist attraction but it proved too much for the dogs who were too afraid to cross over the glass. Security guard Xiong Yin, 35, said: ‘Some of the dogs did not seem to mind but the rest refused to step on the glass. ‘There was a risk that the dogs that were all very small might fall, and so we decided to remove them.

The group, including several puppies, became spooked when crossing part of the bridge that has a glass panel covering the floor . ‘They were very popular with tourists that had been posing for pictures with them. But it was dangerous.’ He added that usually dogs and other animals avoided the bridge, but he believed these dogs had followed a small group of tourists that had been feeding them, and had hoped to get more food later by keeping behind the visitors.

"Click here for all the facts and stats from our brilliant Match Zone . Louis van Gaal has already said it could be three long years before the rebuilding work is complete here at Manchester United and there was little on Saturday to suggest that day might come any sooner. Never mind the challenge ahead. This was a long 90 minutes, a game that was settled by a second-half Juan Mata goal but one that was torturous at times for the Old Trafford supporters who seem every bit as anxious as their team at the moment. Pay no attention to the statistics that boast more than 70 per cent of the possession and a ratio of shots that would have you think Van Gaal had masterminded a commanding performance. VIDEO Scroll down for Sportsmail's Big Match Stats: Manchester United vs Crystal Palace . Juan Mata strikes from the edge of the box with a shot that was deflected past Julian Speroni to give Manchester United all three points . Mata celebrates breaking the deadlock in front of a delighted Old Trafford crowd after 67 minutes . Man Utd: De Gea, Valencia, Carrick, McNair, Shaw, Blind, Januzaj, Fellaini, Rooney, Di Maria, Van Persie. Subs: Mata, Lindegaard, Ander Herrera, Fletcher, Vermijl, Blackett, Wilson. Goal: Mata 67. Crystal Palace: Speroni, Mariappa, Dann, Delaney, Ward, Puncheon, McArthur, Ledley, Bolasie, Chamakh, Campbell. Subs: McCarthy, Doyle, Hennessey, Gayle, Fryers, Bannan, Kelly. Referee: Chris Foy. They were playing a Crystal Palace side that will do well to remain in the Barclays Premier League this season and they produced a laboured display even if their visitors did sit back and let them have most of the ball. Sir Alex Ferguson said United’s football too often lacked pace and ambition when David Moyes was in charge last season and to their all-conquering former manager this would have been no easier on the eye. The fact Angel Di Maria and Adnan Januzaj were both hooked by Van Gaal said it all. Ferguson always employed pace and width to punish opponents but United’s wide men were woefully ineffective on this occasion, with Di Maria a poor imitation of the player who so dazzled when he first arrived from Real Madrid. Yes, Palace defended deep and in numbers. But still Di Maria should be better than this. In fairness to the Argentina international, his failure to really threaten might have had something to do with the orders United seemed to be under. With his own defence severely weakened by injuries and suspension and Daley Blind partnering Patrick McNair at centre half as a result, Van Gaal may well have urged a bit more caution than usual. Both sides observe a minute's silence in honour of the war dead before the start of play as the teams commemorate Remembrance Day . Manchester United and England captain Wayne Rooney takes a shot as United came out of a a frustrating afternoon with a win . Adnan Januzaj looks to inject a little bit of quality into the game as he takes on Joel Ward down the right hand side . Fraizer Campbell had Crystal Palace's best chance of the game but his lob over David de Gea was also over the crossbar . MINS PLD    KM    MILES . Man United                               112.0    69.6 . Marouane Fellaini           90          11.4      7.1 . Michael Carrick               90          11.1      6.9 . Wayne Rooney               90          11.0      6.8 . Crystal Palace                            108.5      67.4 . James McArthur               90          11.3      7.0 .

The fact Wayne Rooney was deployed in midfield alongside Marouane Fellaini — with Michael Carrick planted between them and the back four — rendered Robin van Persie an isolated figure in attack and made United a less potent force as a result. It may not have helped, either, that this was the third formation Van Gaal has employed in 12 games. The manager admitted afterwards that his side needed ‘more speed’, even if he was entitled to be satisfied with a first clean sheet in six games as well as three points that ‘keep them in the race for the places they want’. But they were fortunate not to concede when a mistake by Blind and McNair was almost punished by Fraizer Campbell and not until Mata arrived from the bench did the 67th-minute breakthrough come. As Neil Warnock remarked in his post-match press conference, rarely has he had a better opportunity to beat United at home. The selection of Blind at centre half did make sense when the versatile Dutchman is a naturally defensive player and Carrick was always going to be more comfortable in midfield when this, remember, was his first start of the season. United did look fairly composed to begin with. They enjoyed more than 80 per cent of the possession in the opening 10 minutes and after little more than 20 minutes — according to the statisticians — had completed 174 passes to Palace’s 34. They had also threatened with a decent effort from Januzaj. Luke Shaw prevents Jason Puncheon breaking away for Crystal Palace as United dominated possession but struggled to create chances . Rooney takes a shot but the Palace defence were prepared to put their bodies on the line in a dogged first half defensive display . Michael Carrick, starting his first game this season, is tackled by Marouane Chamakh as Neil Warnock's side proved a frustrating obstacle . Young defender Paddy McNair, who was impressive in a makeshift United defence, works to keep Yannick Bolasie away from goal . But United were also proving a tad impatient, unleashing a series of shots from distance when a more confident attacking team might have tried to get more into the Palace penalty area. United were trying to attack from all areas. Luke Shaw set off from inside United’s half and forced a fine save from Julian Speroni, and Blind also pressed forward only to then concede possession cheaply. Such was the speed with which Palace then broke on the counter-attack Rooney had to cover for his team-mate at centre half. Damien Delaney wins the ball ahead of Januzaj as Palace showed determination to frustrate Louis van Gaal's side for more than an hour . Angel di Maria was finding life tough on a difficult afternoon before Juan Mata's strike put Manchester United into the lead . Di Maria was a shadow of the player he was when he arrived in England - see his pitch map and more in Match Zone . Neil Warnock bellows instructions to his team, who showed plenty of passion and organisation to keep United at bay for so long . Di Maria tries a volley but his way is blocked by a wall of Palace defenders lined up inside their own penalty area . A moment’s misjudgement from Blind and McNair was almost extremely costly, their failure to intercept a long ball forward suddenly invited Campbell to strike. As it was the former United player’s lob over David de Gea floated the wrong side of the crossbar when he really should have scored. With the arrival of the half-time whistle came the sense that 45 minutes of domination had been squandered too. Only once had Speroni really been called upon to make a save, and that must have concerned Van Gaal. A second save for Speroni would come shortly after the break, with Van Persie testing the Palace goalkeeper. But still United needed more urgency; still they needed to attack with more purpose. Rooney threatened with a curling shot that flew narrowly wide but a better chance would come in the 57th minute when Fellaini, having secured the corner in the first place, saw his thumping header cleared off the line by James McArthur. After little more than an hour Van Gaal decided it was time to make a change. Off came Januzaj and on went Mata. The Spanish midfielder had only been on the pitch for four minutes when he put Van Gaal's side into the lead . Mata is mobbed by Robin van Persie and Rooney as Old Trafford experienced a tide of relief with the goal 23 minutes from time . It was a decision that reflected well on Van Gaal, Mata exchanging passes with Di Maria before unleashing a shot that took a deflection off the head of Damien Delaney and beat Speroni despite the Palace goalkeeper getting a hand to the ball. Perhaps Speroni should have done better. Mata almost struck again when another deflected effort bounced off a post, with Van Persie then failing to convert from the rebound. In the end it mattered not. In the end United were rewarded for their dominance with the victory that keeps them just two points off the Champions League places. And right now Van Gaal will take that, even if the task of guiding this club back to the summit of the English game remains a massive one.

"Mammoth Lakes saw nearly 600 earthquakes in 24 hours last week - the worst swarm of tremors in nearly a decade. Monitors show a concentration of seismic activity in the region which has sent shockwaves through the the California town. Starting just before 5am on Thursday they have ranged between 1.0 and 3.8 in magnitude. Scroll down for video . An earthquake monitor shows a collection of seismic activity in Mammoth Lakes, California. Yellow dots show tremors in the last 12 hours and green in the last 24 hours . At least 109 of the earthquakes were magnitude 2.0 or greater, and at least six, however, were greater than magnitude 3.0. A member of the U.S. Geological Survey told the LA Times that it is the worst spell seen in California's Eastern Sierra in at least 10 years. Researcher David Shelly said that they now be tracking the area - one of the most seismically active in the country - closely. Even though they have sent ripples through the community, residents say they are used to it as there are constantly small shocks. There are 17 volcanoes in the region, however most of them are dormant, while there are a countless number of fault lines across the Long Valley Caldera - a 20-mile depression next to Mammoth Mountain. The crater was formed 760,000 years ago during a 'super-eruption' which saw hot ash blanket most of the Western states . Mr Shelly described that deep down in the earth, there is magma, but it is not moving and not what is causing the earthquakes. The swarms are partly caused by volcanic activity under Mammoth Mountain - a volcano which hasn't erupted in 57,000 years . He said: 'It doesn't mean that the volcano is any more active,' he said. 'It's an ongoing process in an volcanic system.' The earthquakes are usually triggered when water and carbon dioxide above the magma move to higher layers of the earth's crust and cracks in the faults. The increase in fluid pressure sets off the movements. In the 1980s, the area was hit with a succession 6.0-magnitude tremors. However it may have been overshadowed by the Mount St. Helens eruption in Washington state - when 57 people died. At the beginning of this year, residents commemorated the 20th anniversary of the North Ridge earthquake. It centered in Reseda, a neighborhood in the north-central San Fernando Valley region of Los Angeles, killing 57 people and injuring more than 5,000.

"Since Sir Alex Ferguson left Manchester United in 2013, his old club have been making a habit of breaking some rather unwanted records. On Sunday, Louis van Gaal's side continued a miserable start to the 2014-15 Premier League season by surrendering a two-goal against Leicester before suffering a shock 5-3 defeat. Not since 1984, against Brian's Clough's Nottingham Forest, have United let a two-goal lead slip as second half goals from Steve Hodge, Johnny Metgod and Gary Mills cancelled out a Gordon Strachan brace.

"A mob stoned to death a suspected terrorist before burning his corpse and eating him in revenge for a series of attacks in Congo that have left 100 people dead. Witnesses said the young man, who has not been identified, aroused suspicion on a bus in the north east of the country when passengers discovered he could not speak the local Swahili language and that he was carrying a machete. Witnesses said he was then stoned to death by the crowd before his body was burned and eaten. Authorities in Congo collect the burnt remains of the suspected terrorist who was stoned to death by a lynch mob before being burnt and eaten . The incident in the town of Beni comes following a number of overnight raids in the area blamed on the Islamist group ADF-NALU. The Ugandan rebels are thought to have massacred more than 100 people this month, using hachets and machetes to kill their victims. Speaking from the town of Beni, Congo's President Joseph Kabila said the ADF-NALU militants would face the same fate as the rebel movement M23, which was defeated by a UN-backed government offensive last year. Mr Kabila said: 'There is no question of negotiation with the terrorists. 'They will be defeated as was the case with the M23. And it will be very soon.' ADF-NALU is an alliance of groups opposed to the Ugandan government that has operated from bases in neighboring Congo since the mid-2000s. Witnesses say the man was set upon after riding a bus and the passengers became suspicious when they found him carrying a machete . The movement was blamed for the deaths of 14 people, who were killed early on Thursday in the village of Kampi ya Chui, bringing the total death toll this month to at least 107, said Teddy Kataliko, president of the Civil Society of Beni. Tensions ran high in the town this morning with around 100 demonstrators blocking the road from the airport into town, throwing stones and waving machetes to demand greater government protection against the rebels. Local government officials could not immediately be reached for comment. Earlier in the week, the government sought to downplay the threat posed by the group, which it had previously said was defeated in an operation earlier this year. UN soldiers stand guard in the town of Beni in Congo earlier this week following attacks that have left 100 people dead . Estimates of its strength vary greatly, but the website of the UN's peacekeeping mission in Congo estimates it has around 500 fighters. The Ugandan government has said ADF-NALU is allied with Somalia's al Qaeda-linked al Shabaab movement, but analysts say the nature of these ties is not clear, despite the ADF-NALU's clear Islamist ideology. In his speech on Friday, Mr Kabila appealed for public support for a ramping up of its offensive against the group, but did not specify what that would entail. Congolese president Joseph Kabila arrived in Beni on Wednesday and gave a speech saying that there was no question of negotiation with terrorists . He added: 'I call on the population to support the army because the victory against the M23 was because the population was behind the army. 'I call on young people to join the army in great numbers.' Mr Kabila also defended the UN peacekeeping mission known as MONUSCO following criticism from locals that it had failed to defend them and had even collaborated with ADF-NALU. Crowds of mainly young men attacked several peacekeeping facilities with stones and bows and arrows last week, forcing the evacuation of some staff. The U.N. mission says it has stepped up patrols in the area in the wake of the massacres.","Witnesses said the suspected terrorist aroused suspicion while on a bus .

"From an online survey of more than 44,000 people, seven came out as the world's favourite number, followed by three and eight . Whether it’s a birthday, the address of your first house, or your age, numbers tend to hold certain significance in everyone’s lives. From an online survey of more than 44,000 people, seven came out as the world’s most popular number, followed by three and eight. But what is the significance of these numbers, and why are so many people drawn towards the number seven? In China, the number 7 is considered lucky because it sounds similar to the Chinese words for 'arise' and 'life'. It is also symbolic of togetherness and, as a result, is seen as a good omen in relationships. The number six traditionally represents humanity, and therefore seven is seen as the centre of humanity and its connection to the creator. Seven is also the number of the universe and combines the heavens, typically symbolised by the number three, and the body of Earth, associated with the number four. The number appears regularly throughout cultures and history, too. For example, there are seven ancient wonders of the world, seven days of the week, seven circles of the universe, seven deadly sins, and seven basic musical notes. In Buddhism, seven is the number of ascent, and Buddha is said to have walked this number of steps at his birth. While in Christianity, God is represented by the seventh ray in the centre of the six rays of creation. In Buddhism, seven is the number of ascent, and Buddha, carved model in Sri Lanka is pictured, is said to have walked this number of steps at his birth. While in Christianity, God is represented by the seventh ray in the centre of the six rays of creation . As part of the study, respondents were asked to nominate their favourite number and give a reason why. The top five were: . Hebrew tradition states seven is the . number of intelligence, and there are seven Great Holy Days in the Jewish year. Elsewhere, the traditional Menorah has seven branches. As part of the numbers poll, respondents were asked to nominate their favourite number. In total, people chose 1,123 individual numbers from 30,025 submissions. Almost half of the submissions were for numbers between one and 10. Every number between 1 and 100 was chosen, as were 472 numbers of those between 1 and 1000. The lowest whole number that received no points was 110. London-based author Alex Bellos who conducted the study said: ‘The reason why a reverence for the number seven is a constant throughout human history can never be known, but to me the only credible reason is because of its unique numerical properties. Hebrew tradition states seven is the number of intelligence, and there are seven Great Holy Days in the Jewish year. Elsewhere, the traditional Menorah, pictured, has seven branches . Fear of the number thirteen is called Triskaidekaphobia, a word coined in 1911, and superstitious sufferers associate the number with bad luck and misfortune. In Tarot cards, Death is the thirteenth card in a deck, while the end of the Mayan calendar's 13th Baktun, or cycle, was said to be the time of the apocalypse in 2012. In religion, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ in the Bible, was the thirteenth member at the last supper. Friday the 13th is considered the unluckiest day of the month. But in Italy, 13 is considered a lucky number, especially when gambling, whereas 17 is considered unlucky. Although it is not known why these numbers hold this significance in Italy, 17 is linked with bad luck because when written in Roman numerals XVII, it can be rearranged to spell the Roman word VIXI meaning ‘I have lived’ - found on ancient tombstones. 'Of the numbers between 1 and 10 seven . is the most arithmetically special. 'It is the only number that cannot be . multiplied or divided with other numbers in the group. For example, the . numbers from 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 can be doubled and still sit within the . group. 'The numbers 6, 8 and 10 divide by 2 and 9 divides by 3.' In second place in Bellos' poll was the number three. It is similarly lucky, especially in China because it sounds like the word birth. Many eastern cultures also consider there to be three important stages to life, namely birth, marriage and death. In Christianity, the number three represents the Trinity - the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit; Three gifts were bought to Jesus in his manger and there were three crosses at Calvary. This number is often used to represent the heavens. According to Teutonic mythology, three is the number of good fortune and fate. The number three is also significant in Norse mythology and paganism. For example, Thor has three main weapons for use against the giants. Elsewhere, in Slavic religion, Triglav is the three-headed god of war. In third place in the poll was the number eight. Spiritually, the number eight is symbolic of infinity and paradise because it follows the seven days of creation. Third place in the poll went to the number eight. Eight is symbolic of infinity and paradise because it follows the seven days of creation. In Islam, the throne of the world is supported by eight angels, each one corresponding to the eight divisions of space and constant letters in the Arabic alphabet, written in The Qur'an pictured . It is seen as lucky in Buddhism, because there were traditionally eight good luck omens, and in China it is seen as a sign of wealth and prosperity. The number 88 is also significant in China because, when written, it resembles the characters used for joy and happiness. In Islam, the throne of the world is supported by eight angels, each one corresponding to the eight divisions of space and the groups of constant letters in the Arabic alphabet. Asked why he undertook the project Alex Bellos said: ‘Favourite numbers are a fascinating area of research since they reveal surprising ways that we are influenced by arithmetic. 'Once I decided to get interested in favourite numbers I have been amazed by how passionately so many people feel about them. It is the love that dare not speak its name.’ The art of numerology claims everything is broken down into single-digit numbers and claims these numbers are present throughout nature and history. One: Traditionally linked to the sun, it is seen as a ‘strong and individualistic’ number and people who favour this number are good leaders with courage and ambition. They can also be demanding and selfish. Two: People who prefer the number two are prone to being emotional and intuitive but are often introverted and overwhelmed by negative emotions. Three: Outgoing and witty people tend to favour the number three. They are expressive and artistic but can be aggressive and egotistical. Four: Alternatively,people who like the number four are sturdy, steady and reliable. They can be stubborn, are complain a lot. Five: This number is linked to travel. Those who prefer this number hate being stuck in one place for too long and are easily bored. They have a tendency to be dramatic and fickle. Six: If someone prefers the number six they are calm and caring, but prone to being clingy, self-righteous and vain. Seven: The winning number in the online poll was seven. According to numerology, this claims the majority of people who took part in the study were wise and intellectual, but can also be critical and impatient. Eight: Powerful, successful people tend to favour the number eight, which came third in the poll and is associated with Uranus, but this can make them materialistic and workaholics. Nine: This number is said to combine the other numbers and their traits. People who prefer the number nine are prone to mood swings and self-pity.","Online survey asked 44,000 people what their favourite number is .

"British intelligence agencies have ‘more blind spots’ when monitoring potential terrorist threats than five years ago, the country's top anti-terror police officer has said. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley said the revelations by former US data analyst Edward Snowden and advances in technology left counter-terrorism detectives at Scotland Yard operating on a ‘shaky platform’. It comes after three men appeared in court yesterday over an alleged terrorist plot, following a police operation three days before Remembrance Day. Metropolitan Police assistant commissioner Mark Rowley warned that Britain's intelligence agencies have ‘more blind spots’ than at any time for five years . Mr Rowley, head of counter-terrorism for the Association of Chief Police Officers (Acpo), told the Times: ‘We are less capable and have more blind spots than we had five years ago.’ ‘Since the Snowden episode and with technology developments our intelligence picture is less good than it was - both domestic and international - and that makes operations harder to run.’ He also suggested powers to relocate terrorism suspects would make a ‘big difference’ after shadow home secretary Yvette Cooper called for them to be reintroduced in the Commons this week. ‘If you have significant information that somebody is a terrorist risk and despite all your best efforts you cannot build a case to put them in prison - really the state has two choices: either to say we'll accept that risk or put in measures where you have some controls around people. ‘It's a political decision, but our experience is that for people in many of the situations we deal with the ability to relocate would make a big difference.’ Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measures (Tpims) were introduced under the coalition government to replace the previous Labour government's control orders, which did include relocation powers. British jihadists fighting for ISIS pose an increasing threat to the UK, intelligence services believe . Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden, in hiding in Russia, leaked details of British and American spy techniques . Labour frontbencher Ms Cooper claimed that Theresa May's introduction of Tpims is failing to manage the risk of terror suspects after it was reported that a 26-year-old man fled the UK in the back of a lorry apparently bound for Syria or Iraq. The Home Secretary replied that the Government would be looking at Tpims in the new Counter Terrorism Bill, which she was bringing forward.","Scotland Yard's anti-terror chief Mark Rowley warns of growing threat .

"A mother who tackled a leading historian on live television about immigration insisted last night that her family’s home town has become like a ‘foreign country’. On BBC1’s Question Time, Professor Mary Beard dismissed stories about the number of migrant workers overwhelming Boston as ‘myths’ and said ‘public services can cope’. But Rachel Bull, an office manager in Boston, who  was in the audience, immediately challenged the Cambridge University classics professor, claiming hospitals and schools are struggling to cope in the Lincolnshire agricultural town. Scroll down for video . Clash: Office worker Rachel Bull, left, challenged Professor Mary Beard, right, on Question Time when the historian dismissed claims that Boston is being overwhelmed by migrant workers . Mrs Bull – whose grandparents moved to Britain from Poland after the Second World War – said that she is not against immigration, but believes ministers should reconsider allowing Romanians and Bulgarians unrestricted rights to live and work in the UK from December 2013. After Professor Beard – known to millions for the BBC2 series Meet the Romans – told Question Time on Thursday night she believed local services in Boston are able to cope, Mrs Bull raised her hand and said: ‘I’m sorry, I really disagree.’ She told the panel, which was sitting in Lincoln: ‘I have a business in Boston, I have family that live in Boston and we’ve got land at Boston and we’ve had major issues with workers who’ve got nowhere to go, camping on our land and we can’t move them off because the police aren’t interested. Boston is at breaking point. All the locals can’t cope any more – the services, doctors’ surgeries, hospitals. ‘I have a family member that’s a midwife at Boston Pilgrim Hospital. The facilities are at breaking point because of these people coming into the country and nothing is being done. You go down to Boston High Street and it’s just like you’re in a foreign country. And it’s got to stop.’ Yesterday Mrs Bull said that Boston, which has a population of around 61,000, is too small to cope with such a large number of migrants, now thought to number 9,000. 'At breaking point': Mrs Bull said facilities in her Lincolnshire hometown are overstretched because of the influx of workers from overseas . She added: ‘The problem is we’re not like these politicians or other people on television, we’re on the frontline. I’ve not been to university, I’m just a 35-year-old who spoke from the heart.’ Mrs Bull, whose  family has a retirement home business, said she is worried that more migrants from Romania and Bulgaria will make the problems worse. She said many workers head to the area on the promise of work, but end up without employment or money. Mrs Bull, who has a 10-year-old son, said: ‘They are going to come to Boston because of the landworkers, the farms and agriculture, that’s where they would get work. ‘But we’ve got so many homeless on the streets, this town has so many problems that are just being swept under the carpet and the locals are crying out. Someone needs to help us. ‘I don’t want it to be about them and us. We all want to work together as one, but when resources are stretched that’s when the animosity starts, and we don’t want that.’ Mrs Bull, who now lives elsewhere in Lincolnshire, said her family has had repeated problems with migrants camping on their land and that it has been impossible to get help from the authorities and police to move them. 'I don't want it to be about them and us... but when resources are stretched that's when the animosity starts, and we don't want that' Rachel Bull . She said: ‘My dad and brother used to go there every day as my dad speaks Polish, to explain to them that they have to move on because we were getting complaints from environmental health, and local residents were complaining about the mess they were leaving. There were empty bottles, human faeces, needles. ‘We felt sorry for them as there was a young couple who had been promised work, they’d been dropped off in  Boston, had their passports taken off them, they had no money, and they were just left stranded. ‘We gave them a bit of money for them to get some food and drink to help them out, but the numbers just grew.’ Mrs Bull’s grandfather was a flight sergeant who fought for Britain, flying Lancaster Bombers and Mosquitoes. She said her family is proud of its background and enjoy pierogi – traditional dumplings – from the local Polish shops. She said: ‘We just want help from the Government, and we want them to reconsider when the Romanians and the  Bulgarians come in.’","Office worker Rachel Bull challenged leading historian Mary Beard on the impact of immigration on her Lincolnshire .

"It will cost Crystal Palace £10million for them to convert Wilfried Zaha's loan switch from Manchester United into a permanent one. The 22-year-old left Selhurst Park in January 2013 but has returned to his former club on loan after failing to make an impression under both David Moyes and Louis van Gaal at United. The Eagles are reportedly working on a transfer window deal  that would see them pay a flat £3million fee, plus £3m in add-ons to United if the triggers are met - and the loss of £4m in add-ons written off in the original deal which saw Zaha leave for Old Trafford.

"Ponocos cop killer Eric Frein wrote a chilling description of his cold-blooded sniper attack on a Pennsylvania State Police barracks in which he shot dead one trooper and gravely wounded a second. 'Friday, September 12, got a shot around 11pm, he dropped. I was surprised at how quick,' the diary reads. 'I took a follow-up shot on his head and neck area. He was still and quiet after that. 'Another cop approached the one I just shot. As he went to kneel, I took a shot at him, one jumped in the door. His legs were visible and still. 'I ran back to the Jeep.' Eric Frein is a survivalist and marksman who has eluded police for nearly a month after a sniper attack on a Pennsylvania State Police barracks that left one trooper dead and another critically wounded . Pennsylvania State Police released these digitally-enhanced pictures of Frein that show him with a beard and with a Mowhawk, which they believe he trimmed his hair into . The diary, which Frein wrote while on the run from an exhaustive police manhunt, was found September 29 at campsite that officers stumbled on in the woods near his home in Canadensis, Pennsylvania, in the Pocono Mountains. State police Lieutenant Colonel George Bivens, read passages from the multipage journal at a press conference today. Corporal Bryon K Dickson II, 38, was killed in the attack on September 12 in Pike County as he stepped outside during a shift change. Trooper Alex T Douglass, 31, was critically wounded when he ran over to help Cpl Dickson. Lt Col Bivens said the diary makes no mention of Frein knowing either trooper - or even that he was intending to target any one individual. Instead, in sets out Frein's desire to kill law enforcement officers and commit mass murder. Some had speculated that Frein deliberately targeted Trooper Douglass because he was friends with Frein's sister-in-law. State police released two new photos of the campsite they found in the woods near Frein's home. He has been evading police for nearly a month . State police released images of this rock formation that . The announcement comes as police released a digitally altered picture of Frein showing him with a beard and a Mohawk, which they believe he cut his hair into. Authorities also released new pictures of Frein's campsite - including a cluster of rocks he was using for shelter. His journal describes how Frein fled in a Jeep, but ran it into a swamp and took off on foot, a botched getaway Frein termed a 'disaster,' said Bivens, who described the document as a 'cold-blooded and absolutely chilling account.' The journal was found September 29, when authorities discovered a campsite at which they also found explosives, ammunition, food, water and clothing. Hundreds of law enforcement officials have been looking for Frein — described by authorities as a survivalist and expert marksman with a grudge against law enforcement — in the woods around his parents' home in Canadensis, in the Pocono Mountains. Officers believe they have spotted Frein in the woods, but the distance and rugged terrain allowed him to slip away. The most recent sighting came Tuesday afternoon, when an officer thought he spotted a brief glimpse of Frein from about 200 yards away, Bivens said. That was the fourth sighting by police or the community since Friday, he said. 'We will get Frein. Whether that is today, whether that is tomorrow or whether that is next week, remains to be seen,' Bivens said. Fri Sept 12th got a shot around 11 pm and took it ... . He dropped ... I was surprised at how quick. I took a follow up shot on his head ... neck area ... . He was still and quiet after. Another cop approached the one I just shot.

"A Darwin man discovered a huge sinkhole which had opened up just metres from his home late last week after he heard the sound of the earth collapsing in on itself. Darwin River resident Lance Hart told Nine News he was alerted to the hole when he heard a 'rumbling kind of like distant thunder'. 'Can't be thunder, it's dry season,' Mr Hart said, before he revealed that when he ventured out into his backyard a few days later he realised something was wrong when he came across a large crack in the earth. Scroll down for video . Darwin river man Lance Hart was amazed when he discovered a gaping sinkhole just metres from his home . Though it's not the first of its kind in the area, this sinkhole is the biggest locals have ever seen. Mr Hart likened it to the famous scene from Crocodile Dundee where Paul Hogan's character bragged, 'that's not a knife, this is a knife', and laughed that he now had the biggest sinkhole. In a video posted to YouTube Mr Hart walked less than 50 metres from the back of his home and stood at edge of the gaping hole, which swallowed trees and boulders. Mr Hart told Nine News he watched enourmous boulders swallowed by the water at the bottom of the hole . His footage shows the sheer size of the sinkhole, estimated to be 40 metres wide and drop down 15 metres to the point where it's filled with water. 'That, is a big hole,' Mr Hart narrated. 'I have no idea how deep that water is, but from the rocks that are still falling in to it... We're seeing massive boulders slide down and disappear underneath the surface so it's obviously very deep,' he continued. Trees as tall as 20 metres which once stood tall where the hole now lies are nowhere to be seen, and experts are unsure whether the gap will continue to expand. Before he reached the hole, Mr Hart found a long fissure in the earth . The sinkhole absorbed everything around it and experts are unsure whether it will continue to expand . Neighbour Daniel Cocks told the program he was extremely grateful the gap didn't appear on his property, where he keeps his collection of 24 old Land Rovers. 'They're 30, 40 year old Land Rovers, I've got 24 of them... I don't really want to lose them, not in a great big hole,' Mr Cocks laughed. At the end of the YouTube video, Mr Hart summed up his new backyard feature in one word: 'Amazing.'","Lance Hart found huge hole after he heard sound of the earth collapsing .

"Ashley Young has had his 'fare' share of criticism in the past and it appears the Manchester United midfielder was in an unforgiving mood after enjoying a night out with his girlfriend Nicky Pike. The couple shied away from the cameras after being spotted getting into a taxi after leaving the plush Novikov Bar in Mayfair on Thursday. The childhood sweethearts, who have two children together, were believed to have left the popular footballers' hotspot at around 11pm and looked less than impressed about being photographed after their evening out. Ashley Young and girlfriend Nicky Pike enjoyed a night out at Mayfair's Novikov Bar on Thursday night . The couple didn't take too kindly to being photographed as they shied away from the camera . And the early night was probably attributed to Young's determination to return to the United starting line-up following a hamstring injury. The 29-year-old hasn't featured in the Premier League for the Red Devils since tearing his hamstring in their New Year's Day 1-1 draw at Stoke City. Young has since made one substitute appearance for Louis van Gaal's side, in their 3-0 FA Cup fourth round replay win at home to Cambridge United on February 3, but started for the Under 21s in their 2-1 win against Chelsea on Monday night. Prior to his injury, the England international was in impressive form for United - having made 13 appearances this campaign by the turn of the year. And Young is keen to continue to improve under Van Gaal - who has deployed the midfielder in an unfamiliar left wing-back role with relative success.

I think there a lot of players who just like to stick to one position, but for me I don't mind as long as I'm in the team,' said Young, who made his 100th Reds appearance in last week's win over Cambridge, in an exclusive interview with the club's official match programme United Review earlier this week. 'I'm pleased with how the season has gone personally. Of course you always have that thing in your head that makes you want to do better. 'I'm my own worst critic – I want to play my best and I always try to do my best. Even when I've played well there is usually something that I think back to that I didn't do right. 'I think this season has so far gone as well as it could have gone for me, bar the injuries. I'm happy about that and hopefully we can continue with good results as a team.'

"The police force responsible for controlling the Ferguson riots has spent more than $170,000 replenishing stocks of riot control equipment ahead of an expected revival of disorder. Michael Brown, 18, was shot dead by police officer Darren Wilson in a confrontation on August 9 that sparked months-long protests across Ferguson, Missouri. The police's recent spending is aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether the Officer Wilson will face a criminal trial for the August 9 death of Brown. Police officers wait to advance on protesters after firing teargas during the worst of the Ferguson riots in August . The police force's response to the disorder triggered concerns about the militarization of police . As well as accusations local police were racially profiling black members of the community, concerns were raised about the force's military-style response to the disorder. It has now been revealed that since August, when the protests first began, St Louis County police have spent $172,669 on crowd control equipment, the Guardian reported. This included spending on 650 teargas grenades, 1,500 beanbag rounds and 6,000 pepper balls. Further spending was also made on 235 riot gear helmets, 135 shields, 25 batons and 60 sets of shin guards. Meanwhile, the future of the chief of police in Ferguson remains unclear amid reports he will step down from this position as soon as next week. Police chief Thomas Jackson is expected to announce plans to leave his post as part of an effort to overhaul the city's police department, CNN is reporting, citing 'government officials'. The move is said to be part of an attempt to show the people of Ferguson the department is taking action regardless of the result of Officer Wilson's grand jury trial. It could also be a way of offering the community a 'sacrificial lamb' in the case of the grand jury deciding not to indict him on criminal charges. CNN is reporting that the announcement could come next week. Scroll down for video . 'Stepping down': Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson will step down from his position next week as part of an effort to overhaul the city's police department, according to reports . Jackson has faced a major backlash over the way his department handled the shooting of Michael Brown in August . 'The animosity that existed in Ferguson were way before Mike Brown's shooting, justified or not. So, unfortunately, the leadership in the police department has to change,' said CNN legal analyst Mark O' Mara. 'And if he's sort of a sacrificial lamb to get this started, it's going to have to be. Ferguson's going to have to more forward. And it doesn't seem they can move forward with this police chief in place.' As part of the plan the St. Louis County police chief will step in as the interim chief for Ferguson. However the reports are being shot down by Jackson and the local press. 'It’s absolutely not true. Nobody has asked me to resign nor have I been fired,' Jackson told the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Shot dead: Michael Brown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend . Police officer Darren Wilson shot Michael Brown in a confrontation on August 9, the circumstances of which have been heavily disputed . Similarly, in a sit-down interview with CNN late last month, Jackson apologized for the way his department handled the Brown incident and its aftermath, with police clashing with protesters. However he maintained he would not be stepping down. 'I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,' Jackson said on September 29. 'Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through. 'This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it.' Scene: This image shows investigators inspecting the body of Michael Brown Saturday August 9, 2014 . Aftermath: Demonstrators protest following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown . Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics. Grand jury proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilson's testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged. The decision could be made public within the next month. In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick, widespread arrests. They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy, community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets. Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement. That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare.","St Louis County police has spent $172,669 replenishing riot  equipment .

"If there’s one gadget that is crying out for a redesign it’s the humble umbrella, whether they’re being torn apart in the wind or clashing into people. That’s where the Air Umbrella comes in. The ambitious design creates a 'force field' of air above a user to deflect rain. The potentially revolutionary device comes in three sizes but won't be available until late next year. Scroll down for video . A Chinese inventor is seeking funding for his Air Umbrella gadget (shown). It is a replacement for regular umbrellas, using air instead of fabric. The sceptre-like device blows out air at the top to make a 'force field'. This protects the person or people underneath from rain. Credit: Air Umbrella/Kickstarter . The gadget was created by inventor Chuan Wang from Nanjing, China and it is currently part of a Kickstarter campaign. On their page the team notes that the product is still in a research and development phase - although that hasn’t stopped them already reaching their target of £6,200 ($10,000). The Air Umbrella will come in three sizes and prices to meet different needs. The smallest is Version A, which measures 11.8 inches (30 cm). Version B is 20 inches (50 cm) long while Version C can be extended and retracted, growing from 20 to 31 inches (50 to 80 cm). A is the cheapest at £55 ($88), B will set you back £61 ($98) and C is £67 ($108). However the battery life isn’t terribly impressive, ranging from only 15 to 30 minutes. The long and thin device resembling a regular umbrella but without the fabric. It works using a lithium battery to power the fans inside. At its base is a button that turns it on and off, while the bottom can also twist to change the size of the air emitted. Above this is the somewhat large lithium battery, with a motor mounted on top. This drives a set of fans in the head of the sceptre-like device. Air is drawn in at the bottom of the head, and then expelled at the top. This creates a canopy of air above a person that will blow water away and apparently keep you dry in the rain.

However, the company doesn’t say how the device copes in windy conditions. And you’ll have to wait a little while to get your hands on it, with the release not due until December 2015.

"Disney theme parks make up four of the world’s top 20 tourist attractions, according to new research. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida, Tokyo Disneyland, Disneyland Park in California and Tokyo DisneySea registered a total of more than 66 million visitors last year. The destinations are among 15 theme parks included in a list of the world’s top 50 tourist attractions compiled by tourism website Travel + Leisure. The most popular tourist destination across the globe last year was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013 . The most popular destination across the globe was Istanbul’s Grand Bazaar, which recorded 91.25m visitors in 2013. The 15th century market is famous for its hand-painted ceramics, lanterns, intricately patterned carpets, and Byzantine-style jewelry. Mexico City’s The Zócalo - the ceremonial Atzec plaza - came in second place with 85 million visitors, while New York’s Times Square was third in the list with 50 million. The Zocalo hosts military parades, cultural and political events, concerts, exhibitions, fairs, and public art installations, while Times Square is known for it lively entertainment, Broadway shows and many shops. Disney World’s Magic Kingdom in Orlando, Florida recorded 18.6 million visitors last year making it the 12th most visited tourist attraction in the world . Other attractions that made up the top ten were New York's Central Park, and Union Station in Washington D.C. which both attracted 40m visitors. The Las Vegas Strip came in sixth position followed by Tokyo's Meiji Jingu Shrine and Sensoji Temple. Niagara Falls was in ninth place while New York City's Grand Central Terminal was in tenth position with 21.6m visitors. There was no place on the list for any British attractions, and the least visited place in the top 50 most popular tourist destinations was the Taj Mahal, which still recorded between seven and eight million tourists. It means the British Museum in London (6.7 million), the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (6.3 million), and the Roman Colosseum (5.1 million) narrowly missed the cut. Nevada's Las Vegas Strip attracted 30.5m annual visitors in 2013, making it the sixth most popular destination . The figures were compiled from data supplied by government agencies and industry reports including the Global Attractions Attendance Report. The attractions themselves also supplied their own data when ticket sales weren’t available. Travel + Leisure defined tourist attractions as ‘cultural and historical sites, natural landmarks, and officially designated spaces’. It meant that while destinations such as the Las Vegas Strip made the list, popular spots such as malls and shopping centres were not included, despite often attracting tens of millions of visitors each year. Beaches and religious sites were also omitted. Niagara Falls in New York and Ontario registered 22m visitors, placing it ninth in the top 50 tourist attractions . Bourbon Street in New Orleans was 45th in the list of the world's top 50 destinations with 7,470,000 visitors . The publication of the list comes shortly after the World Tourist Organisation published their annual report earlier this year detailing the state of global tourism. It revealed there was a five percent growth in international tourism in 2013, which amounted to an additional 52 million tourists and which brought the total up to 1.087 billion. The growth defied predictions that the global economic downturn would slow tourism. Regions that showed the biggest growth in international tourism in 2013 were Asia, Africa and Europe. Of these areas, Southeast Asia, Central and Eastern Europe and North Africa were the most popular places to visit. The Taj Mahal in India recorded between seven and eight million visitors in 2013 putting it in 50th position . The Great Wall of China had 10.7m visitors in 2013, making the historic attraction the 26th most popular site . The Palace of Versailles, in France just made it onto the list with 7,527,122 tourists visiting the site last year . The Forbidden City in Beijing attracted an astonishing 15,340,000 in 2013, making it the 16th most popular tourist attraction in the world last year . The Great Smoky Mountains National Park in North Carolina and Tennessee had 9,345,695 in 2013 . Europe currently remains the most visited region in the world, welcoming an extra 29 million visitors last year to attract a total of 563 million tourists – 52 percent of the entire tourist market. Northern, Southern and Central America saw an increase of six million visitors to reach a total of 169 million. Africa attracted three million more arrivals than 2012, reaching a new record of 56 million. Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico City, recorded 20 million tourists in 2013, putting it in 11th place . The list of top 50 travel destinations also revealed that South Korean theme parks Everland and Lotte World were among the most visited attractions, beating the Eiffel Tower with nearly seven million, the Great Pyramids with nearly four million and Stonehenge with one million. Travel + Leisure noted that accessibility can be a factor in determining how many visitors visit a particular attraction, adding that it takes extra effort to reach destination’s such as Yellowstone National Park, which recorded 3.2 million visitors, the Terracotta Army in Xi'an, China, which had 4.8 million, and Peru’s Machu Picchu, which has restricted tourism to 2,500 entries per day, or 912,500 per year. 1 Grand Bazaar, Istanbul .

"Tony Blair has refused to rule out working for President Putin as he defended making millions from advising some of the world’s worst despots. Rejecting claims that he has no credibility as a Middle East peace envoy or international advisor after taking Britain into the Iraq War under false pretences, he also argued he now understands the world better than do western governments - who should ‘listen to me’. Mr Blair’s extraordinary remarks were made in an interview with Vanity Fair in which he defended the considerable wealth he has accrued since leaving office while insisting his main aim was to improve the world. Tony Blair with Russian president Vladimir Putin. Blair has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders . Mr Blair, 61, has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders, including the ex-Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi and Kazakhstan president Nursulstan Nazarbayev. After detailing Mr Blair’s work for several questionable world leaders, the author of the profile and interview, Vanity Fair contributing editor Sarah Ellison, wrote: ‘And is there anyone he wouldn’t work for? ‘For instance, would he work for Vladimir Putin if Putin called asking for advice? Blair smiled, and switched the topic to Kazakhstan.’ Later she wrote: ‘He paused and then added, “I’m not holding my breath for the call from Putin.” Tony Blair greets Kazakhstan's President Nursultan Nazarbayev in Downing Street during 2000. Blair has been widely attacked for selling his services to some of the world’s most authoritarian leaders . ‘But if it came, I asked? “It won’t come, so let me not either praise or insult”.’ He insisted the Russian leader was never likely to seek his services. Mr Blair, who insisted that ‘whatever criticisms people have of me, they’ve seldom thought of me as politically stupid’, said there were no conflicts of interest between his charity role and lucrative work as an international advisor. But he stressed that he was now a ‘private sector individual’ not a government representative and should not be bound by the same rules. Quizzed on his most controversial legacy, Mr Blair said the world should listen to him precisely because of his track record in Iraq and Afghanistan. ‘People say, “Why should you listen to him?” – because of Iraq. And I keep saying, that’s why you should listen to me. Because I’ve been through this in government, and since leaving office I’ve been studying it the whole time, he said. He added: ‘One thing that is quite interesting to me is how poor Western governments are at the moment – and I don’t exempt mine from this – how poor they are at understanding what’s going on in the world.’ His own understanding of the world, he boasted, was ‘just so much more sophisticated and deep than the understanding I had in government’. Unfortunately for Mr Blair, those who have encountered him in his role as official envoy of the Quartet – the international coalition seeking peace in the Israeli-Palestine conflict - told Vanity Fair they were not impressed. A prominent Israeli lawyer said he had ‘trivialised’ the Quartet while Mahmoud Labadi, a senior Palestinian leader, dismissed him as ineffectual. And there was also some withering criticism from his former friend, novelist Robert Harris, who compared Mr Blair’s controversial post-Downing Street years to a Greek tragedy. Harris described his former friend as a ‘very curious individual’, saying: ‘The truth is whatever he perceives it to be at a given moment. I don’t think he’s ever really…lying. I think he becomes convinced at the moment he’s saying something that it’s true.’","Blair made comments as he defended making millions from advising some of the world’s worst despots .

"Cristiano Ronaldo touched down in Manchester on Sunday evening ahead of his much-anticipated return to Old Trafford - a match that will see the Real Madrid star go head-to-head with Ballon d'Or rival Lionel Messi. Wearing a red Michael Jordan Nike baseball hat with the words 'Born and Bred' on the front, Ronaldo arrived in Manchester with his Portugal team-mates where they face Argentina in a friendly at Old Trafford on Tuesday night and the Real Madrid forward is most certainly the star attraction. The former Manchester United ace will make just his second appearance at his former stomping ground since leaving for Madrid in 2009 - and the presence of Barcelona's Messi means there will be a mouthwatering clash in prospect.

Lionel Messi takes in tea as a standard looking recovery session begins on his left leg . Messi poses with Argentina team-mates Javier Mascherano (left) and Angel di Maria, who will play at his home stadium . Ronaldo, as he so often does, got Portugal out of a rather sticky hole on Friday when he scored the winner with just 18 minutes remaining against Armenia to ensure his nation remain in the hunt for qualification for the 2016 European Championship in France. That goal also brought Ronaldo yet another record. With that solitary strike, Ronaldo moved ahead of former Newcastle United, AC Milan and Denmark forward Jon Dahl Tomasson on to 23 goals in the European Championship, ensuring he is now the leading scorer in the competition's history (qualifying and tournament combined). In what will be the 27th meeting between Ronaldo and Messi - who will make his second appearance on English soil in five days after starring in Argentina's 2-1 victory over Croatia at Upton Park last Thursday - English fans are sure to be dazzled by some remarkable skill. Ronaldo became the highest scorer in European Championship history with his goal against Armenia, beating Jon Dahl Tomasson .

Like Ronaldo, Messi stepped up when his nation needed him most and converted the winning penalty to complete a comeback victory for Argentina against Croatia on a night when Carlos Tevez made his return to the home of West Ham United. But the little maestro looked relaxed as he sat on a treatment table during a recovery session in Manchester, sipping tea and talking to a friend.

"Flight 666 to 'HEL' on Friday the 13th ought to be virtually empty with superstitious travellers quietly booking the next flight. But passengers on AY666 to Helsinki in Finland appeared not to be too concerned as the plane was almost full when it took off from Copenhagen today. Even pilots on board the Airbus were sharing a joke about the unlucky numbers. Friday the 13th: Flight AY666 to Helsinki in Finland from Copenhagen was almost full today . 'It has been quite a joke among the pilots,' said pilot Juha-Pekka Keidasto before flying the Airbus A320 from Copenhagen in Denmark to Helsinki. 'I'm not a superstitious man. It's only a coincidence for me.' The daily flight AY666 from Copenhagen to Helsinki falls on Friday the 13th twice in 2013.

Pure HEL? The Finnish capital of Helsinki in high season . Some airlines, such as Scandinavian Airlines, do take such fears 13 seriously. The airline does not have a row 13 on board.

The number 13 said to represent disorder: There were 12 apostles in the Bible and there are 12 hours in a day, and 12 months in the calendar. But passengers on flight 666 to 'HEL' should have had a calm flight over the Baltic at this time of year. 'It's hopefully smooth skies,' Keidasto said on Guardian online. 'And if there's some passenger who is anxious about this 666, our cabin crew is always happy to help them.' The flight later landed safely.","Passengers on AY666 to Helsinki in .

"With tears in her eyes and a quivering voice, the mother of a critically injured Chinese toddler left to die in the street after she was run over twice has pleaded with her little girl to get better. Qu Feifei, the mother of two-year-old Yue Yue - which translates as Little Joy in Chinese - was clearly in emotional agony speaking about her child who has been declared brain dead. She said she told her girl: 'Don't give up on mum, mum is not giving up, let mum have one more chance to love and spoil you.' She may now face the painful decision of whether to turn off the life support machine keeping her daughter alive. The Chinese Government's state news agency Xinhua quoted doctors as saying Yue Yue 'is in a deep coma and clinically brain dead'. Scroll down for the video... Warning: Graphic content . Devastated: Yue Yue's mother Qu Feifei has been told her two-year-old daughter is brain dead . Agony: Qu Feifei may now face the decision of having to turn off her daughter's life support machine . Fighting for life: Yue Yue, two, is in a critical condition in intensive care after being run over twice . Cared for: The little girl has regained the ability to take weak breaths with the help of a respirator and has some feeling in her arms . It appears her condition has deteriorated, despite showing signs of some recovery earlier this week. 'We cannot give any information,' said a hospital spokesman this morning. Her parents, who are poor migrant workers, have been keeping millions informed about their daughter's condition via a specially created website. Despair: Yue Yue's mother reacts after finding out the toddler was run over while she was in a nearby market . Distraught: The girl's parents wait anxiously for news in the hospital, where she is in a coma . Yesterday they posted that Yue Yue was showing signs of recovery and said medication had been reduced. Reports claimed her heart beat had stabilised and she had regained the ability to take weak breaths and some feeling in her arms. But as of Wednesday evening Beijing time, no update had been posted. There were initial reports this morning that Yue Yue had died, but these appear to be unfounded. Unaware: Video footage shows the little girl crossing the road at Guangfo Hardware Market, without spotting the van approaching . Injuries: The girl is hit by the van, which fails to stop leaving her lying in the road . Horrific: Yue Yuem lies critically injured on the floor after she was run over by a van in Foshan city, Guangdong, China . Callous: Dozens of people then drive or walk past the critically injured child without stopping to help her . Child victim: Yueyue is held by her mother. Her older brother is also pictured . The shocking incident was caught on CCTV and has stunned millions in China, with many saying their society – which has enjoyed 30 years of rapid development – is rotten and immoral. It also sparked global outrage after more than a dozen people can be seen in the footage walking or driving past the stricken girl as she lay in the street in Foshan city, Guandong province. Yue Yue was only moved from the road when Chen Xianmei, a street scavenger, stumbles across her. Chen told reporters: 'I didn't think of anything at the time, I just wanted to save the girl.' The case is quickly becoming a political issue and it is feared Communist Party officials have called for tighter controls over the reporting about the incident for fear of a public backlash. President Hu Jintao is in his final year of office and his main policy and slogan has been to build a 'harmonious society'. But millions are using Yue Yue's tragedy to highlight all that is wrong with modern China and claim their society is anything but harmonious. Public anger is festering over rampant corruption in politics and business, lack of the rule of law, pollution that is seeing cancer rates soar and the widening rich-poor gap, with many of the 'spoilt' siblings of the political elite – so called princelings – being singled out for extra criticism. Both drivers who ran over Yue Yue have been arrested, but claimed not to have seen the little girl in the 'dark' street. Chinese media reports that one of the men had allegedly just broken up with his girlfriend and was on his mobile phone when he hit the girl. Heroine: Chen Xianmei became an instant symbol of understated decency after she saved baby Yue Yue's life . The Shanghaiist claims one driver called Yue Yue's father to offer him money just before he was arrested. It claims he said: 'You saw that girl on the CCTV footage, she didn't see where she was going, you know. I was on the phone when it happened, I didn't mean it. When I realised I had knocked her down, I thought I'd go down to see how she was. 'Then when I saw that she was already bleeding, I decided to just step on the gas pedal and escape seeing that nobody was around me.' Authorities in Foshan presented Chen, who went to Yue Yue's aid, with $1,570 as a reward. Another company in the city has also offered to donate $7,500 to her family and rescuer. Many people in China are hesitant to help people who appear to be in distress over fears they will be blamed. High-profile law suits have ended with good Samaritans ordered to pay hefty fines to individuals they sought to help. The incident has also sparked a series of soul-searching articles in Chinese newspapers, including the Guangzho Daily and People's Daily Online.

"ISIS is on the lookout for a skilled professional to manage its failing oil refineries and has been using black-market agents to advertise the £140,000-a-year post. The terror group is said to have captured at least 11 oil fields in Iraq and Syria during its offensive campaign and was thought to be making around £2million-a-day from sales in June. But a string of fatal accidents and a lack of ideological commitment from trained engineers has seen its profits slump by more than two thirds. Meet your new bosses: ISIS is looking to recruit a skilled manager to run its faltering illegal oil business . Up to now jihadists have run their newly-acquired business through intimidation - threatening to kill employees' families if they fail to comply. But their murderous approach to those not loyal to the ISIS cause has seen them hemorrhage trained engineers, The Times reports. The refineries manager position is the most senior of several vacancies that the terror group is hoping to fill. Oil workers in Iraq say black market agents have been spreading the word through jihadist networks - casting their net as far afield as north Africa. Robin Mills, at Manaar Energy, a consultancy firm in Dubai, has confirmed the reports but believes ISIS will struggle to attract the best staff with the pay packet they are offering. He said: 'The money is good, but it's not that good. A western oil exec posted to Iraq right now, let alone working for ISIS, would expect to earn a lot more than that.' Biggest source of wealth: A pro-militant social media account put out this picture of smoke rising after an attack by ISIS on the country's largest oil refinery in Baiji in June . And officials at Iraq's North Oil Company, which has lost one field to ISIS, said: 'With each round of fighting, more staff drift away. Initially they coerced staff, threatening to kill their families. Now they're offering the carrot instead.' It is believed the militant group has also struggled to attract large buyers for its product. Matthew M. Reed, a Washington-based consultant who analyzes oil and politics in the Middle East, told CBC News last month: 'No big traders, no serious companies are going to fool around with that oil. 'That oil is essentially radioactive at this point. No one wants to touch it.' What that means is that the vast majority of the group's oil sales is going to so-called 'middlemen'. These are people who own their own tanker trucks and who have connections to established smuggling networks in northern Syria and southern Turkey, or to local refineries in places like Syria, Iraq, Kurdistan and Turkey. Under threat: Iraqi security forces said they advanced to within one mile of the city of Baiji this week in a new offensive to retake the country's biggest oil refinery . Mr Reed adds: 'They're relying on very small transactions and a lot of them in order to move the oil because they're selling it by tanker truck more often than not. 'And a tanker truck can't hold that much oil.' The terrorist organisation has gone about plundering oil and gas facilities since its emergence in 2012 and last month was said to have appointed an 'oil minister' to run the illegal industry after its operatives stole 200 lorries in Iraq. It has captured oil fields at Sasan, Ajeel and Sadid in Iraq as well as Omar in Syria while large refineries have also been captured at Fallujah, Aksas and Tikrit. Iraq's largest oil refinery in Baiji, located around 130 miles north of Baghdad, has also been under siege since June - and is thought to be ISIS' biggest source of wealth . Mission: The terrorist organisation has gone about plundering oil and gas facilities since its emergence in 2012 . Using smuggling networks to transport their product across borders - jihadists can make around £15 a barrel . After many existing engineers fled ISIS has been forced to operate with 'skeleton staff' at some of their facilities including Omar, which has changed hands three times since the conflict started. It is understood that ISIS was taking about 80,000 barrels a day from oil fields it was controlling in Iraq and Syria - but that has halved in recent months. Iraqi security forces said this week they were now within a 1.2 miles of the city of Baiji in a new offensive to retake the refinery.","Terror group has captured at least 11 oil fields in Iraq and Syria in campaign .

"Christian Bale has said drones would be sent out after biblical character Moses had he been real and alive today. Bale, who plays Moses in Exodus: Of Gods and Kings, the forthcoming biblical epic directed by Ridley Scott, added that although Moses is depicted as a freedom fighter in the Bible, he is seen as a 'terrorist' by his enemies. The says he came to these conclusions while studying religious books and scriptures from different religions, including the Bible, the Torah and the Koran. Scroll down for video . Christian Bale said drones would be sent after 'terrorist' Moses had the character been real and alive today . 'What would happen to Moses if he arrived today? Drones would be sent out after him, right?,' Bale said in an interview with ABC's Nightline. '[He was] absolutely seen as a freedom fighter for the Hebrews, but a terrorist in terms of the Egyptian empire.' He also praised British director Ridley Scott, the man behind blockbusters such as Gladiator, Blade Runner and Alien. 'What he is writing is a story of revolution,' Bale said. 'And that's a story that can resonate, no matter what time.'

He upset several Christian writers with his comments, who claimed they meant that Exodus: Of Gods and Kings would not stick to the Bible. Christian writer, Brian Godawa, wrote on his blog that he hoped Bale's comment was 'a reflection of the actor's own ignorant bigotry than of the actual movie.' Chris Stone, the founder of Faith Driven Consumer, an organisation which campaigned to reinstate Duck Dynasty star Phil Robertson following the show's suspension over homophobic slurs, said he was surprised by Bale's description of Moses, The Hollywood Reporter wrote. 'There's nothing in the biblical history that supports that,' he said. 'It's an indication that there will be a tremendous disconnect between Bale's interpretation and the expectations of the market.'

A video showing a user browsing his account clearly shows this. Satellite images have also been obtained which show two Buk-M1 air defence missiles in the bottom left hand corner. If Russian BUKs were supplied to the rebels in Donetsk, it is unclear when exactly they were sent. Some accounts suggest they were secretly smuggled across the border this month, while others say earlier.

It was filmed at around 8.45pm on Saturday.

"A garbage truck has become trapped in a sinkhole in a busy Melbourne road after a burst water main caused the bitumen to collapse. A crane was used to extract the truck from the road at midday, five hours after the vehicle became stuck on Orrong Road in the inner city suburb of Armadale. Sergeant Paul Melrose from Prahran Police told Daily Mail Australia that the truck became trapped in the ‘half-a-metre to metre deep’ pothole on Friday morning when the bitumen collapsed. Scroll down for video . The KS Environmental garbage truck sank into the bitumen in the Melbourne suburb of Armadale at 7.30am on Friday morning. The truck is expected to remain stuck in Orrong Road for hours to come, until a crane removes it from the collapsed road. Prahran Police estimate the sinkhole is around a metre deep, explaining 'the back wheels have sunk into the road up to the vehicle's rear axles.' ‘A water main has burst and as water has flowed through underneath the roadway, it has worn away at the road's foundations. ‘The truck drove over the road and with no support underneath it, the bitumen has collapsed and the truck has dropped down into the hole, all the way to its back axles,’ said Sergeant Melrose. The road is closed in both directions and will remain closed, with 110 homes expected to be without water for several hours this afternoon, according to a spokesperson for South East Water. Crews have switched off the water in the area as they work to repair damage to the road after the KS Environmental truck 'hit the burst water main in the road,' according to South East Water. 'Crews were called to the site early this morning to block off the area and assess damage after the water main burst. 'Unfortunately, repairs have been delayed after the truck hit the water main. We apologise for the inconvenience.' The busy Armadale street will be closed in both directions for most of the day, causing major dramas for commuters in the suburb, seven kilometres south-east of Melbourne's CBD. Drinking water is available to households without water at 110 Orrong Road, Armadale. KS Environmental told Daily Mail Australia they have ‘no comment’ about the mishap. The busy street will remain closed in both directions, which is expected to continue to cause problems for motorists in the suburb, which is only seven kilometres south-east of Melbourne's CBD. A post on social media shows the road closure and a number of workmen trying to move the garbage truck. A crane will be required to finally extract the truck from the sinkhole. The burst water main, which caused the road's foundations to erode and bitumen to collapse, has now been fixed and turned off. It is currently unknown how long road repairs will take once the truck has been removed. ‘The usual early morning traffic was hampered by the road closure,’ said Sergeant Melrose. It is unknown at this stage how long it will take to repair the damage to the road.","A truck has been trapped after a burst water main caused road collapse .

"The police chief at the center of the scandal that erupted after an officer shot teenager Michael Brown dead insists he will not be stepping down. Thomas Jackson has said he is staying put despite calls for him to quit and months of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of the 18-year-old. He says that he wants to 'see it [the scandal]' through and believes he has the support of the police and the community. The storm began when Officer Darren Wilson, who is white, shot the African American teen on August 9. Scroll down for video . Defiant: Thomas Jackson (left) has said he is staying put despite calls for him to quit and months of unrest in Ferguson, Missouri, following the death of 18-year-old Michael Brown in August . His death was followed by months of riots in the city along with calls from the community for the police to be held accountable. According to officials, the plan was to oust Jackson  as a result of the scandal, but they hoped he may have left of his own accord. But told CNN: 'I'm going to stay and see this through.' Jackson added: 'I certainly have the support of the police department and the community. I have a lot of support in the community. I think this is my job to complete, and I'm going to do it.' This week the force stocked up on riot gear ahead of the grand jury decision over whether Wilson will be charged for Brown's death. More than $170,000 worth of equipment has been taken in to help take the unrest expected in the wake of the decision. As well as accusations local police were racially profiling black members of the community, concerns were raised about the force's military-style response to the disorder. This included spending on 650 teargas grenades, 1,500 beanbag rounds and 6,000 pepper balls. Further spending was also made on 235 riot gear helmets, 135 shields, 25 batons and 60 sets of shin guards. A Grand Jury is set to decide whether Officer Darren Wilson (left) will be charged over the death of the youngster. Police have brought in more riot gear to prepare for further unrest . In a sit-down interview with CNN late last month, Jackson apologized for the way his department handled the Brown incident and its aftermath, with police clashing with protesters. However he maintained he would not be stepping down. 'I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,' Jackson said on September 29. 'Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through. 'This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it.' Continuing conflict: The youngster's death was followed by months of clashes with police in Missouri - some of them turning violent . Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics. Grand jury proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilson's testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged. The decision could be made public within the next month. In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick, widespread arrests. Expected disorder: Law enforcement will receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement . They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy, community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets. Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement. That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare.","Thomas Jackson says he is going to 'see this [the scandal] through'

"They are meant to excite and tantalize viewers, creating suspense and intrigue. Producers hope to pack enough action into their film trailers to make people go to the cinema as soon as films are released. But now cinemagoers are reporting that trailers can actually be a huge disappointment - either giving away the entire plot of a film or being better than the movie itself. Scroll down for video . Cinemagoers want to be excited and teased in film trailers such as for The Hobbit: Desolation of Smaug, but many feel trailers are giving too much away or are more exciting and engaging than the film, research found . Research by the University of East Anglia's school of art, media and American studies found that more than 80 per cent of people have been left disappointed with a film after seeing the trailer. Some viewers complained about spoilers while others said the trailers created unrealistic expectations of action and adventure that never materialised. The researchers studied responses to the trailer for The Hobbit: The Desolation Of Smaug, found that audiences want trailers which excite, tease and leave them emotionally engaged, without revealing excessive narrative. Lead researcher Keith Johnston said: 'Despite the enduring appeal and apparent popularity of these coming attractions, modern trailer releases arrive with a perceived popular stigma - the presumption that they actively mislead or deceive audiences. Viewers criticised the trailer for the new Hobbit film for its special effects and departing from the actual book . The Man of Steel trailer had an emotional and engaging tone which viewers felt was absent from the film . 'Our research confirms this complaint. 'But we also found that audiences are aware of those issues when they watch a trailer, and find trailers enjoyable despite the expectations that a marketing campaign might set up.' The trailer for the next Hobbit film was criticised for the HD look of the film, its perceived reliance on cameos and over reliance on cameo appearances. Among the complaints about trailers were that they gave away too much of the action and plot, and gave a 'distorted view' of the film. Others complained that the trailer for The Grand Budapest Hotel was more exciting than the movie they saw . Films such as Free Willy have been criticised in the past for giving away the plot and ending of the 1993 movie . The Superman film, Man of Steel, was criticised by respondents to the survey for having a strong emotional and narrative hook, which viewers felt the film lacked. The Grand Budapest Hotel was also viewed by many as being a disappointing film after an engaging and fun trailer led people to expect more. Prometheus however was praised in the study as 'wonderful in its own right, and did an absolutely brilliant job of showcasing something that promised to be thoughtful, spectacular and exciting.' The trailer for Cast Away gives away the plot that Tom Hanks eventually is rescued and returns to see his wife . Prometheus was one of the films praised for its trailer, showcasing the action that features in the film itself . Mr Johnston added: 'The key message to trailer producers, however, is that audiences want to be excited and teased about forthcoming films, to be emotionally engaged without feeling pummelled by excessive narrative revelation.' Other films have been criticised for giving away too much in their trailers. In the trailer for Free Willy viewers are already informed of the ending of the classic, with a shot of the killer whale freed and swimming in the ocean. Similarly in Cast Away an image of Tom Hanks returning to his wife after spending so long stranded on the beach may create emotion, but also gives viewers a clue as to the ending of the film.","Study found most cinemagoers disappointed with film after seeing its trailer .

Word of peace: Pope Francis condemned the actions of ISIS and said that although Muslim leaders need to take stronger stand on religious terrorism, greater inter-faith dialogue is needed . Pope Francis sought to offer a balanced message as he met with Turkish officials upon his arrival in Ankara, his second trip to the Middle East this year. 'Fanaticism and fundamentalism, as well as irrational fears which foster misunderstanding and discrimination, need to be countered by the solidarity of all believers,' Francis told Turkish officials at President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's massive new presidential palace. Francis praised Turkey's welcome of some 1.6 million refugees and said the international community had the 'moral obligation' to help Ankara provide for them. The three-day visit comes at a sensitive moment for the Muslim nation, as it weighs how to respond to the Islamic State advance amid U.S. calls to get more engaged with the international coalition fighting the extremists. Turkey has accused ISIS of casting a shadow over Islam and has said Muslim countries have a duty to stand up against the group's radical views. Welcome: Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Pope Francis  review an honour guard during a welcoming ceremony at the presidential palace in Ankara . Peace keeper: Pope Francis sought to offer a balanced message as he met with Turkish officials upon his arrival in Ankara, his second trip to the Middle East this year . The pope is on a three-day visit to Turkey with the delicate mission of strengthening ties with Muslim leaders while condemning violence against Christians and other minorities in the Middle East . Turkey is still negotiating with the United States over how and to what extent it will be helping the coalition in its battle against ISIS. Erdogan has been pressing for a safe haven and a no-fly zone along the Syrian border with Turkey and also wants the coalition to go after Syrian President Bashar Assad's regime. Sensitive to the delicacy of the geopolitical issues at play, Pope Francis treaded lightly in his opening remarks, not pressing any overtly political statement. The pope was greeted at Ankara's Esenboga Airport by a line of Turkish dignitaries, headed by Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu, as he descended the steps of his plane. He inspected and greeted Turkish honor guards before heading to the mausoleum of the Turkish republic's founder, Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, where he laid a wreath. Paying his respects: Pope Francis lays wreaths at the mausoleum of modern Turkey's founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk in Ankara on Friday . 'My wish is that Turkey, which is a natural bridge between the two continents, is not just a point of intersection, but at the same time a point where men and women belonging to all cultures, ethnicity and religion live together in dialogue,' Francis wrote in a guest book at the mausoleum. Beyond the geopolitical issues, the three-day visit will give Francis a chance to reach out to Turkey's tiny Christian community - less than one percent of Turks is Catholic - and visit with the spiritual leader of the world's Orthodox Christians, Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew I. Francis will tour two of Istanbul's most impressive sites, the Hagia Sofia - the Byzantine church-turned-mosque that is now a museum - and the nearby Sultan Ahmet mosque, Turkey's most important place of Muslim worship. The Vatican's plans call for him to pause in the mosque for a moment of 'reflection.' The Vatican added a speech to Francis' itinerary Sunday at an event in which some Syrian refugees are expected to attend. The absence of any meeting with a group of refugees had raised eyebrows given that Francis had met with refugees in Jordan and in the Palestinian territories and has made welcoming refugees a major thrust of his papacy.","Pope Francis called for greater inter-faith dialogue over terrorism .

"Louis van Gaal has accrued players worth a total of £150million, been handed a gentle list of fixtures to begin the campaign, and was afforded breathing room from the pressure of continuing Sir Alex Ferguson’s legacy. But, remarkably, the stunning defeat by Leicester means Manchester United have started this season worse than they did under David Moyes. With Moyes in charge, United gained seven points from their opening five Premier League games – as well as picking up victories in the Community Shield, Champions League and Capital One Cup – while Van Gaal has collected only five points and was dumped out of the League Cup 4-0 by MK Dons. Louis van  Gaal (centre) reacts during Manchester United's humiliating defeat at Leicester . David Moyes endured a nightmare start as manager of United - but it was better than Van Gaal's . Such early comparisons may turn out to be wholly erroneous but they are nonetheless alarming. Van Gaal is a better fit for United than Moyes, and his record shows he should get it right, but it is worth examining the context of United’s current circumstances. 16 Aug - Swansea City (H) 1-2 . 24 Aug - Sunderland (A) 1-1 . 30 Aug - Burnley (A) 0-0 . 14 Sep - QPR (H) 4-0 . 21 Sep - Leicester City (A) 3-5 . 17 Aug - Swansea City (A) 4-1 . 26 Aug - Chelsea (H) 0-0 . 1 Sep - Liverpool (A) 0-1 . 14 Sep - Crystal Palace (H) 2-0 . 22 Sep - Manchester City (A) 1-4 . United fans will not enjoy the Premier League table as it stands today with the club in a lowly 12th position... ...and here is the Premier League table as it stood on September 22, 2013 - with United in eighth position . Transfers . During last summer’s transfer window Moyes believed Ed Woodward was going to land him a world-class central midfielder, with Cesc Fabregas the leading target. Thiago Alcantara looked on at one point and Ander Herrera too but instead United ended up scrambling to buy Marouane Fellaini for £27.5m on deadline day - £4m more than his buyout clause. There was an aborted last-minute deal for Fabio Coentrao. Juan Mata arrived in January for £37.1m but only played 12 games under Moyes. Van Gaal splashed out £60m to bring Argentina forward Angel di Maria to the club from Real Madrid . Marouane Fellaini was Moyes's only big-money buy as United missed out on all their targets . By contrast Van Gaal walked into the job with Luke Shaw and Herrera secured for a combined £60m, then sanctioned deals of £16m for Marcos Rojo, £14m for Daley Blind, and a British-record fee of £60m for Angel Di Maria. Radamel Falcao arrived for a £6m loan price. But for all the glitz, graft was missing. Arturo Vidal failed to materliaise and Kevin Strootman is injured. Mats Hummels, the commanding defender United are crying out for, stayed in Dortmund. Nemanja Vidic departed before Van Gaal arrived. Nonetheless, it is fair to say the Dutchman has been backed in the market more than his predecessor. Tactics . A classic 4-4-2 formation was the sole preserve for Moyes in his first five league games; two strikers, two wingers, two central midfielders and a flat back four. It was the system Ferguson used to make United great. At Everton, Moyes had preferred a sole centre forward with his wide men tucking in but the players available in his new job dictated that wasn’t possible. In the 4-1 defeat by Manchester City, however, 4-4-2 became rigid as his team were pulled apart by the fluid movement of their rivals. Van Gaal has toyed with two different formations already. He employed a 3-5-2 system to begin with, having found success with it at the World Cup with Holland. But it is naturally a counter-attacking set-up at odds with United’s ethos and the paucity of defenders made it a hindrance. No wins have come through using it so far. Daley Blind (left) has been entrusted with the sizeable task of shoring up United's all-star midfield . Ashley Young perhaps best sums up Moyes's insistence on using wingers in a 4-4-2 formation at United . Against Queens Park Rangers, Blind was handed the holding midfield role in a new diamond formation – 4-3-1-2 or 4-1-2-1-2 depending on your preference – as Di Maria and Herrera drove forward from deep to support No 10 Mata and strikers Robin van Persie and Wayne Rooney. The win was exhilarating but it papered over defensive frailties that were ruthlessly exposed by Leicester. Blind is asked to cover too much ground across the pitch and without experienced central defenders behind, or full-backs staying deeper, the problem is exacerbated. It might require another switch in formation to address the problem. Van Gaal’s history shows he is adaptable and innovative. Substitutions . Part of the problem with Moyes, from a supporters’ point of view, was his apparent dawdling over changes during matches. It would seem he deliberated excessively over how to alter losing positions and only make substitutions when it was too late. Only Tom Cleverley was sent on during the defeat at the Etihad while the goalless draw against a Chelsea team intent on defence could have benefited from attacking replacements earlier. Van Gaal has not exactly shown the Midas touch from the bench yet either. Nani for Javier Hernandez and Fellaini for Herrera in the loss against Swansea failed to work. Against Leicester we can only assume Di Maria was exhausted, otherwise taking him off for Mata with the score at 3-3 when the Argentine was on song was bizarre. Van Gaal has used his maximum of three changes in each match trying to test his entire squad, and on three occasions has been forced to make a switch because of injury. A stern looking Juan Mata (back right) listens to his boss on the bench at Leicester . Moyes was able to call on the likes of Danny Welbeck, who is now at Arsenal, from the bench last season . Fixtures . It is indisputable that Moyes was handed harder opening games than Van Gaal. Last season, United played three of the big boys in Liverpool, Chelsea, and City, with a trip to Swansea and a home tie against newly-promoted Crystal Palace the ‘easier’ games (both were won). Seven goals scored, six against. Van Gaal’s set of fixtures has been markedly more appealing, including matches against all three promoted teams plus a home match against Swansea and visit to Sunderland. Nine goals were scored, with eight against, but given three matches in four from late October will come against City, Chelsea and Arsenal, Van Gaal would surely have hoped for more points on the board. Gylfi Sigurdsson celebrates scoring during Swansea's shock opening-day victory at Old Trafford . Rooney faces up to United's 4-1 derby defeat at rivals Manchester City under Moyes last September . Public statements . The area where Van Gaal does trump Moyes is in front of the cameras. Whereas Moyes seemed uncomfortable with the enormous focus on being United manager, Van Gaal carries an aura and speaks with confidence. Within a short period after the list was released Moyes was railing against the fixture computer and hinting at the hard run being somehow contrived. There were also regular blasts at referees. Ferguson was obviously never shy to venture down such routes but from Moyes it transmitted a sense of early excuse-making. (Words such as ‘try’ and ‘hope’ peppered his interviews, much to the irritation of supporters familiar with bold declarations of United’s intent.) Captain Wayne Rooney rages at referee Mark Clattenburg during the 5-3 defeat at the King Power Stadium . Moyes never gave off an air of authority in the same way that Sir Alex Ferguson did at United . Compared with Van Gaal, who declined the chance to blame Mark Clattenburg for his officiating in awarding Leicester’s highly-dubious first penalty on Sunday. ‘I don't know if it is a penalty but we have to look at ourselves because we made such big errors as a team,’ he said. There will be occasions when the officials get blamed but in the context Van Gaal had to accept United’s failings were the cause for their capitulation. From that mentality, he can address the faults. Like our Manchester United Facebook page here.","Manchester United crashed to a 5-3 defeat at Leicester on Sunday .

"The name Brabham could return to Formula One if ambitious plans to revive the iconic brand come to fruition. Codenamed 'Project Brabham', the aim is to use crowdfunding as its main financial source to create what they claim will be 'an innovative model of open-source racing'. Brabham will initially return to the track next season with a three-year LMP2 programme in the World Endurance Championship. David Brabham, son of late triple world champion Jack Brabham, (left) with Sir Stirlng Moss . By year four, the marque will run as a constructor in LMP1, with the goal of winning the WEC and Le Mans. Longer-term ambitions include the prospect of competing in Formula E, as well potentially making a comeback in F1. Brabham's last race was in 1992 in Hungary, with 1996 world champion Damon Hill at the wheel in his maiden campaign. Spearheading the project is David Brabham, son of three-times world champion Sir Jack, and who has enjoyed an exemplary racing career of his own. Brabham, winner of Le Mans in 2009, said: 'I have long dreamt of seeing the Brabham team back out on the track, winning at the highest level and continuing the legacy my father laid down when he first started the team in the '60s. An advert for the 'crowdfunding' campaign to build a world endurance championship team . 'Looking at the normal racing model was not exciting or sustainable enough for me to rebuild the team from scratch. 'For me to bring Brabham back we have to do things differently. 'After careful consideration and research we have created a new model of open-source racing which will bring fans closer to the action, inspire drivers and engineers around the world and offer the rare opportunity to be a part of this new, but historical, race team. 'We will open the door to people and share the incredible journey that awaits us. 'I am a big believer in the power of collective thinking and see many advantages in this model that will help Brabham become a winning team again, but in a new and inspiring way. The Brabham team won back-to-back constructors' and drivers' titles in 1966 and 1967 . 'Who knows where that could lead? Back to Formula One, I hope. 'Project Brabham gives people the chance to be part of the team from the start.' Sir Jack Brabham, who died earlier this year, remains the only driver in F1 history to have won the world title - in 1966 - with a car of his own construction. Further constructors' and drivers' titles followed in 1967 with New Zealander Denny Hulme at the wheel, whilst Nelson Piquet won two further drivers' championships in 1981 and 1983 under current F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone's ownership. David Brabham himself competed in F1 with Brabham in 1990 and again four years later with Simtek.","David Brabham said he planned to use 'crowdfunding' to build a team .

"A hard-partying Baltimore woman who was shocked to find a $362 Uber cab fare after a night of drinking has managed to recoup her loss - and then some - with crowd funding . Gabrielle Wathen used the online cab service to get home after her 26th birthday party on Halloween Friday night. She was charged nine times the standard rate because 'prime time' surge pricing was in effect for the 22-minute ride back to her apartment. Scroll down for video . Night out: Gabrielle Wathen , 26, from Baltimore, Maryland was stunned when she checked her receipts from the night before and saw that Uber had charged her in ‘prime time’ when rates are higher . Instagram: Wathen explained her predicament on Instagram, right, and showed the Uber receipt, left . She set up a page on GoFundMe called 'Uber Stole My 26th Birthday' and said she 'spent a good two hours of my birthday crying over' the massive taxi bill. 'I feel taken advantage of and cheated by the Uber name. $367 for a 20 minute ride should never be justified, even on Halloween,' she wrote. Within 12 hours, Miss Wathen was able to raise nearly $600 from sympathetic donors - enough to cover the bill and pay for another big night out. The page has since been taken down. As many commentators on her page pointed out, even highly intoxicated, she should have known the cab ride would have been expensive. Uber alerts riders when surge pricing is in effect and the smartphone app makes passengers type in the price increase (in this case, nine times the standard rate.) 'I felt sympathy for maybe a second, because I've been in a position where I couldn't get a cab to save my life, and walking when I get off work at 3am is dangerous. I take Uber all the time and you have to AGREE to the rates! Even drunk I've known what I could spend. They didn't steal anything from you... But it sure looks like you have no problem stealing from others,' one user wrote. Another commenter said: 'Um, you have to type in the amount for Uber when it's at peak. I'd be happy to take you to an AA meeting instead...' Wathen wrote: 'I live in Baltimore and went out with my friends to celebrate my birthday at midnight. 'When 3 AM rolled around, I suggested we take an Uber home to avoid drunk driving (#responsibility/#MADD). 'I live 22 minutes, tops, from the party I was leaving.When I awoke this morning, I heard a friend talking about how outrageous Uber rates were the night before (9x original rate).

My rent is $450 and I can no longer pay it today due to this completely outrageous charge. She wrote: 'I worked incredibly hard this week to be able to enjoy my birthday this weekend. 'This misunderstanding has cost me 80 per cent of the funds I have to my name (embarrassingly so) and I spent a good two hours of my birthday crying over it. ‘I feel taken advantage of and cheated by the Uber name,’ she added. 'Thanks for the ride, Muhammed. ‘$367 for a 20-minute ride should never be justified, even on Halloween.'

"With Manchester United once again in the grip of a defensive crisis, Louis van Gaal could call upon Michael Carrick as a stopgap in Saturday's Premier League match with West Ham. The midfielder has long been a fall-back for United at centre-half and, having recovered from an ankle injury suffered in the summer, could make his first appearance under the Dutch boss. United's most experienced centre-back, Jonny Evans, limped out of Sunday's defeat to Leicester with an ankle problem while Phil Jones has a hamstring injury and Tyler Blackett is suspended. Michael Carrick could be forced into action at centre-half in this weekend's game with West Ham as Manchester United find themselves in the midst of another defensive crisis . Louis van Gaal is missing key personnel at the back as United aim to return to form against the Hammers . Jonny Evans limped off with an ankle injury during United's embarrassing 5-3 defeat to Leicester on Sunday . Tyler Blackett was sent off at Leicester and will be suspended for Saturday's match at Old Trafford . Carrick is, of course, more comfortable in central midfield but has never complained when called upon to slot in at the back. His performances in such a role, however, have been somewhat mixed. Carrick was pressed into action in defence when United played at Everton on the opening weekend of the 2012-2013 campaign but was bullied by Marouane Fellaini, who scored the only goal in a 1-0 win. But for the heroics of David De Gea, United could have been on the receiving end of a thrashing as Carrick struggled to adapt to his role. Fellaini, now at United, towered above him for the winning goal in the second half. Marouane Fellaini outjumps Carrick to score Everton's winner on the opening weekend of the 2012-13 season . Carrick had problems with Braga forward Eder when United played Braga in the Champions League . And a week later, there were more problems as United started with Carrick alongside Nemanja Vidic in a 3-2 win over Fulham. In a Champions League tie with Braga, playing with Jonny Evans, he was embarrassed by the Portuguese side's frontline of Alan and Eder as they took a two-goal lead. United went on to prevail 3-2 but their abysmal start exposed an alarming lack of depth at the back. The season before, Carrick played alongside Phil Jones in a home match against Blackburn and again struggled as United fell to a 3-2 defeat on Sir Alex Ferguson's 70th birthday. He was at fault for Yakubu's goal to put Blackburn two goals up and looked shaky all afternoon. Back in December 2009, Carrick was forced to anchor a makeshift back three at Fulham with Darren Fletcher and Ritchie De Laet alongside him. Carrick struggles with Fulham's Danny Murphy during a Premier League meeting in December 2009 . All were completely overpowered as Fulham romped to a 3-0 win thanks to goals from Danny Murphy, Bobby Zamora and Damien Duff. But it's not all been bad. On other occasions, Carrick has performed well in the defensive position. Last season, David Moyes asked him to fill in against West Ham alongside Jones and United kept a clean sheet in a 2-0 success. In 2011-2012, he played competently alongside Evans as United thrashed Wigan 5-0 at Old Trafford and back in 2009, he marshalled a back three of himself, Fletcher and Patrice Evra in a 3-1 Champions League win over Wolfsburg. Carrick successfully marshalled the United back line in their 2009 Champions League win over Wolfsburg . In the summer, former United favourite Gary Neville tweeted that Carrick would be the 'perfect' fit as centre-back in Van Gaal's 3-5-2 formation. But though such a system worked well for Holland at the World Cup, Van Gaal has already abandoned it in the Premier League. And on the balance of past evidence, even if the manager returned to it, Carrick would not be the man to play in such a crucial position. These are desperate times for Man United and Van Gaal simply can't afford to have Carrick performing badly at the back. United's emergency defender must stand up and be counted this weekend along with the rest of the back line.

"It was a hectic summer of comings and goings at Old Trafford, with the deadwood quickly being shifted out to make way for the exciting and expensive new acquisitions demanded by Louis van Gaal. But is there life after Manchester United? We have a look at how those who departed have been faring at their new clubs in the early part of the season. DANNY WELBECK (Sold to Arsenal on deadline day for £16m) No two ways about it, Welbeck looks a new player since swapping Old Trafford for the Emirates. Revitalised and rejuventated, the England striker has scored four goals in his first five matches for the Gunners and looks to be enjoying his football again. Danny Welbeck has enjoyed a new lease of life after leaving Manchester United for Arsenal . Welbeck scored a hat-trick in Arsenal's 4-1 win over Galatasaray in the Champions League on Wednesday . Welbeck's move made perfect sense, with United bringing in Radamel Falcao and captain Wayne Rooney undroppable, he was going to rot if he remained. At Arsenal, he has game time and a fresh sense of purpose. Wenger said his performance against Galatasaray on Wednesday, in which he scored his first ever hat-trick, was 'electric' and more goals appear inevitable. 8/10 . RIO FERDINAND (Released; joined Queens Park Rangers in July) The vastly experienced centre back, 35, was not expected to play a great deal in United's defence this season and his 12 years of service at Old Trafford came to an end. As it happens, Van Gaal could have done with Rio after a debilitating injury crisis left him desperately short at the back. The former England man may not have been the solution, however, judging by the poor start he has made at Loftus Road. QPR have conceded 13 goals in the six matches Ferdinand has featured. He was at fault for their opening day defeat by Hull when he allowed James Chester to score the winner from a corner and he was tormented by Peter Crouch in the 2-2 draw with Stoke a fortnight ago.4/10 . Rio Ferdinand has struggled to shore up QPR's leaky defence since arriving at Loftus Road during the summer . NEMANJA VIDIC (Joined Inter Milan on a free transfer in July) Vidic, 32, insisted his summer move to Italy was a 'step forward' in his career but things didn't get off to the best of starts. He endured a nightmare debut at Torino, conceding a penalty in the first half before being sent off late on for sracasticaly applauding the referee. After serving a one-match suspension, Vidic returned against Palermo but was caught out just three minutes in, losing the ball to Franco Vazquez who went on to score. And things didn't get much better in Sunday's 4-1 home defeat by Cagliari as the Inter defence was ripped open time after time. Vidic also conceded a penalty when he hauled down Marco Sau. 4/10 . Nemanja Vidic has been responsible for some costly errors at the beginning of his Inter Milan career . SHINJI KAGAWA (Joined Borussia Dortmund for an undisclosed fee in August) On the scrapheap at Old Trafford, Kagawa made a wise decision and returned to the club where he made his name - Borussia Dortmund. He immediately reminded the 'Yellow Wall' what they'd been missing with a goal against Freiburg on his first match back and has been pretty good since. He showed something like his best form in Dortmund's 3-0 Champions League win over Anderlecht on Wednesday, setting up two goals and showing the kind of incisive passing that persuaded United to sign him in the first place. Sir Alex Ferguson admitted to Jurgen Klopp that he failed with Kagawa but it looks like he is now slowly returning to his full ability. 7/10 . Shinji Kagawa has been impressive since returning to first club Borussia Dortmund . PATRICE EVRA (Sold to Juventus for £1.2m in July) With the big money arrival of Luke Shaw, Evra's opportunities, like those of Vidic and Ferdinand, appeared limited and he moved on to Juventus. The Frenchman, 33, has made a good start to his career in Italy, helping his new team to four consecutive clean sheets in Serie A and the Champions League. They were finally breached by Atletico Madrid on Wednesday night, suffering a 1-0 defeat. Evra has claimed that the move has reawoken a sense of sacrifice for the cause that had gone missing at Old Trafford. He told Italian newspaper La Repubblica: 'Now there are so many strong players, but I do not know if they are for Manchester - for this club you have to sacrifice everything. That is the culture that I have rediscovered at Juve.' 8/10 . Patrice Evra in action for Juventus during their Champions League match with Atletico Madrid this week . TOM CLEVERLEY (Loaned to Aston Villa) Cleverley admitted he would have to leave Old Trafford to shake off the negativity that has surrounded him over the last two years and he's started well enough at Villa. His debut came in a 1-0 win over Liverpool at Anfield and manager Paul Lambert described his display as 'fantastic.' Back-to-back 3-0 losses to Arsenal and Chelsea were less encouraging but Cleverley has the perfect chance to rebuild his reputation at Villa Park. 6/10 . Tom Cleverley takes on Chelsea's Willian during Aston Villa's 3-0 defeat at Stamford Bridge on Saturday . JAVIER HERNANDEZ (Loaned to Real Madrid) Like Welbeck, Chicharito knew he would only get a regular run of games away from Old Trafford. To that end, Real Madrid wasn't the obvious destination but he's done fairly well so far. Hernandez has been a popular addition with fans and team-mates alike and he opened his account with two goals in the 8-2 win over Deportivo. His role will continue to be making an impact from the bench but Carlo Ancelotti did start him against Ludogorets in the Champions League. Unfortunately, he missed a really good close-range chance and Karim Benzema, the man who replaced him in the second-half, went on to score the winner. 7/10 . Javier Hernandez in action for Real Madrid against Ludogorets in the Champions League . NANI (Loaned to Sporting Lisbon) With little to no chance of playing for United this season, Nani returned to Sporting. He's certainly been playing more and even scoring - against Maribor in the Champions League and against Gil Vicente in the Portuguese league. But the club's form has been disappointing and they sit seventh in the table after 10 games. Nani missed a penalty against Arouca during his first game back and was involved in a bizarre incident against Belenenses when he and Jefferson tries to carry off an opponent they believed was play-acting late in the game, leading to the latter getting sent off. 5/10 . Nani takes on Chelsea's Oscar during the sides' Champions League meeting on Tuesday . WILFRIED ZAHA (Loaned to Crystal Palace) The 'forgotten one' under David Moyes, Zaha wasn't likely to fare much better under Van Gaal and returned to Crystal Palace to try and salvage his talent. He started well enough, scoring the Eagles' last-minute equaliser in a 3-3 draw at Newcastle United. He has since started in the goalless draw with Burnley and the Capital One Cup loss to Newcastle. Zaha seems to be slowly but surely rediscovering his touch but a permanent move away from United would be sensible. 7/10 . Wilfried Zaha on the ball for Crystal Palace during their Capital One Cup tie with Newcastle last week . ALEXANDER BUTTNER (Sold to Dynamo Moscow for £4.4m in June) United got a decent price for the long-forgotten left-back and the 25-year-old is seeking to resurrect his career in the Russian capital. He has started seven matches this season but expressed his exasperation that all anyone wants to talk about is his time at United. 6/10 . Alexander Buttner playing for Dynamo Moscow against Panathinaikos in the Europa League . FEDERICO MACHEDA (Joined Cardiff City on a free in July) One-week wonder Macheda had spent most of his Old Trafford career on loan and was only likely to flourish if he moved away permanently. He is featuring for Cardiff but his only two goals so far came at Port Vale in the Capital One Cup. 4/10 . Federico Macheda finds the net in Cardiff's match with Sheffield Wednesday - but it's disallowed . BEBE (Sold to Benfica for £2.4m) Arguably the biggest flop of the Ferguson era, Bebe finally left the club for Benfica over the summer.

"A new ISIS propaganda video has emerged on social media showing the indoctrination and training of dozens of child soldiers from Kazakhstan. Entitled 'Race Towards Good', the video was produced by the terror group's main media branch, Al Hayat Media Center. The dialogue in the video interchanges between Kazakh and Arabic, with three sets of subtitles including English. The high quality film opens with a slow motion sequence of two lines of armed Kazakh adult fighters jogging along in the desert. In between the two lines, a lone fighter wearing a peaked hat can be seen riding a white horse and carrying the black flag of ISIS. Scroll down for video .

They are preparing themselves to fight the kuffar (non-believers) and the mushrikin (polytheists) who are spreading their kufr and shirk, and to fight the tawaghit (sinners) in their various forms.' The propaganda video shows a group of new adult ISIS recruits from Kazakhstan training in an assault courses and receiving specialist sniper training. Ranging in age, the adults are also shown in a classroom being taught about the firing range for different sniper rifles - including weapons from the United States. The video states that 'soon they will be ready to join the army of the Islamic State' before shockingly revealing the role of Kazakh children in ISIS. The video shows the youngsters shouting God is Great in Arabic. The video states: 'They begin their days in search of knowledge in the schools of the Islamic State where they are taught to hold firmly to this creed. This is coupled with a resolve forged in the midst of worldwide crusader aggression, which together form the ultimate base for raising tomorrow's mujahidin (fighters).' The video shows the children learning how to read and write in a classroom before military training . It also shows Kazakh men receiving instruction in the use of sniper rifles and other infantry tactics . Unlike the recruits, the sniper instructor is masked as he teaches the men how to deal with range . The young boys are shown catching the bus to their religious school. One of the boys mimics pointing a rifle towards the camera whilst others recite ISIS slogans. The boys are then shown being taught the ISIS radical interpretation of Sharia'h law in a classroom. A Kazakh cleric is shown sitting in the classroom, where he tells the camera what it means to be a Kazakh in the Islamic State. 'We spent our childhood far away from this blessing. We were raised on the methodology of atheism, and Allah's refuge is sought.' He goes on to denounce the West, claiming 'the kuffar poisoned our minds.' He insists 'Our children are happy. They're living in the shade of the Qur'an and Sunnah.' After showing the Kazakh boys being taught to interpret the Qur'an and learn how to read and write Arabic, the children are shown undertaking military training. The video cuts to the youngsters undergoing the same military drills practiced by the men . It is shows the young boys developing their hand-to-hand combat skills in the classroom . The propaganda video shows a toddler brandishing a toy sub-machine gun while wearing military fatigues . The boys are shown sitting in a group and are all wearing matching camouflage fatigues. One of the boys shows off his ability to strip apart and reassemble a machine gun whilst the other boys watch on with little interest. The scene is narrated by an interview with the children's Arabic teacher, who claims: 'They will move on to do physical and military training until they get older and pound the thrones of the tawaghit. With Allah's permission, they are the next generation. They are the ones who will shake the earth and spread this precious deen (religion) to all regions of the earth.' The child soldiers are then shown carrying out gun manoeuvres and tactical formations. It also briefly shows shots of the boys working out in the gym and practicing martial arts. One of the Kazakh children, who gives his name as Abdullah, is asked in an interview what he is doing. The boy replies: 'I'm training in a camp.' When quizzed about what he will do in the future, Abdullah chillingly declares with a smile: 'I will be the one who slaughters you, O kuffar (non-believer). I will be a mujahid, insha'allah (God willing.)' The boy is then shown as part of the Kazakh boys brigade sitting as a group. A toddler, wearing a balaclava is seen tottering nearby, carrying a mock machine gun and wearing military fatigues. One of the older boys leads a prayer before proclaiming the group's message: 'We're going to kill you, O kuffar. Insha'allah we'll slaughter you.' At the end of the chilling video, one of the children is interviewed and explains that he is 'training in the camp' He then explains how he will go on to kill people claiming that he will become a fighter . The final scene shows the boys jogging with their rifles along a road like the adult fighters at the beginning of the video. The video's final statement reads: 'These youth are honoured with being the future flag bearers of Islam.' It is thought that at least 300 Kazakh nationals have travelled to Syria and joined Islamic State, according to the National Security Committee of Kazakhstan. Nurtai Aykayev, chairman of the committee, wrote in a report that 150 of the 300 Kazakh nationals, who had joined Islamic State, were women. Dr Andreas Krieg, Assistant Professor at the Department of Defence Studies in Kings College London said Kazakhstan was not a target area for ISIS. He said: 'They are currently concentrating on Iraq, Syria, Libya and Yemen. Although recently Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi recently said he was looking to franchise the organisation in different Muslim countries. 'Teaching the foreign fighters Arabic is very important to them as they want to be able to win hearts and minds of the people in their core target areas. The reason they are training children, is the same reason the like of Hamas have been training children for the past 20 years. It is to indoctrinate them and create the next generation of fighter.' Dr Krieg said the reason young men from Kazakhstan were willing to join ISIS is similar to those prompting British people to travel to Syria and Iraq. 'Kazakhstan is a reasonably stable country. These men, like those in Britain and other western countries are disenfranchised by the society they live in. They are very susceptible to the ISIS narrative.' Iraqi Shiite militia have joined with regular Iraqi forces around Tikrit, northern Iraq to fight against ISIS . The combined forces have had several successes against ISIS forces who had taken over the area . The major counter attack is believed to have killed 'tens of terrorists' in reclaiming a northern enclave . Meanwhile, ISIS has murdered 25 members of a Sunni Muslim tribe in the Anbar province in Iraq. The bodies were discovered by members of the Iraqi army on the eastern edge of the Iraqi provincial capital Ramadi. Local officials believe the men were murdered because they opposed the ISIS incursion into their territory. Hathal Al-Fahdawi, a member of the Anbar Provincial Council, said the bodies of the men, who are from the Albu Fahd tribe, were discovered after the Iraqi army launched a counter-offensive against ISIS. He said: 'While they were combing the territories they are liberating, security forces found 25 corpses in the Shujariya area . Albu Fahd tribal leader Sheikh Rafie al-Fahdawi said at least 25 bodies had been found and said he expected the total to be significantly higher. He said the bodies were found scattered around with no signs of weapons next to them, suggesting they were not killed during fighting. Last month ISIS killed hundreds of members of the Albu Nimr tribe in Anbar in an attempt to break local resistance to their advances in the Sunni Muslim province they have largely controlled for nearly a year. ISIS has also been attacked in the Anbar province where Iraqi troops have been supported by US air power . ISIS, which has seized control of large parts of Syria and Iraq, continues to gain territory in Anbar despite three months of U.S.-led air strikes launched against the group. On Friday it launched coordinated attacks in central and outlying areas of Ramadi in an attempt to take full control over a city which is already mostly in its hands. The road from Ramadi to the military airbase of Habbaniya, about 15 miles to the east, remained under ISIS control on Saturday, Hathal Fahdawi said, preventing the army from reinforcing security forces in the city. He said tribal fighters backed by army tanks were trying to secure the road to allow forces through from Habbaniya. The ISIS lightning offensive through northern Iraq in June plunged the country into its gravest security crisis since the U.S.-led overthrow of Saddam Hussein in 2003, and raised concerns that its radical ideology will spread. In northern Iraq, a farmer near the city of Mosul discovered around 60 bodies believed to be those of prisoners killed by Islamic State fighters when they overran the city's Badush prison on June 10, witnesses said on Saturday. The bodies were found after heavy rain disturbed their mass grave. The United Nations said up to 670 prisoners from Badush were killed by Islamic state five months ago.","New ISIS propaganda video shows young children training with firearms .

"Abusive dating behavior is pervasive among America's adolescents, according to a new survey. The federally funded survey says a majority of boys and girls who date describe themselves as both victims and perpetrators. Sponsored by the National Institute of Justice, the National Survey on Teen Relationships and Intimate Violence was conducted by NORC at the University of Chicago, a prominent research center which provided preliminary results to The Associated Press. Not a game: A majority of boys and girls who date describe themselves as both victims and perpetrators of abuse . Input came from a nationwide sample of 667 youths aged 12-18 who'd been dating within the past year and who completed a self-administered online questionnaire. Nearly 20per cent of both boys and girls reported themselves as victims of physical and sexual abuse in dating relationships - but the researchers reported what they called a startling finding when they asked about psychological abuse, broadly defined as actions ranging from name-calling to excessive tracking of a victim. More than 60per cent of each gender reported being victims and perpetrators of such behavior. The survey found no substantive differences in measures by ethnicity, family income or geographic location. Elizabeth Mumford, one of the two lead researchers for the survey, acknowledged that some of the behaviors defined as psychological abuse - such as insults and accusations of flirting - are commonplace but said they shouldn't be viewed as harmless. 'None of these things are healthy interactions,' she said. 'It's almost more of a concern that our gut reaction is to accept this as natural.' The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in its campaigns against teen dating violence, also stresses the potential seriousness of psychological abuse. 'Teens often think some behaviors, like teasing and name calling, are a ""normal"" part of a relationship,' says a CDC fact sheet. 'However, these behaviors can become abusive and develop into more serious forms of violence.' Bruce Taylor, the other lead researcher for the NORC survey, said the overall abuse figures were higher than previous national studies of dating abuse, revealing 'the startlingly widespread nature of this problem.' Using a definition under which adolescent relationship abuse can occur in person or through electronic means, in public or private, and between current or past dating partners, the survey estimates that 25 million U.S. adolescents are victims and nearly 23 million are perpetrators. Mr Taylor and Ms Mumford said the high rates in their survey may stem in part from youths being candid due to the privacy of the online format. They also suggested that dating abuse is now so common that young people have little concern about admitting to it. The survey found fairly similar rates of victimization and perpetration among boys and girls - even in the sub-categories of physical abuse and sexual abuse. Many previous studies have found that girls are markedly more likely to be victims of physical and sexual dating abuse than boys. Survey says: Input came from a nationwide sample of 667 youths aged 12-18 who'd been dating within the past year . However, the researchers detected a shift as adolescents age. 'We found that girls perpetrate serious threats or physical violence more than boys at ages 12-14, but that boys become the more common perpetrators of serious threats or physical violence by ages 15-18,' they wrote. Mumford noted that the questionnaire did not delve into such details as which party instigated a two-way confrontation, or whether injuries resulted. She said it was possible girls suffered more serious injuries than boys. 'Our work suggests that prevention programs need to address both victimization and perpetration, not one or the other,' Ms Mumford and Mr Taylor wrote. They recommended starting prevention programs in middle school, and noted that that teen dating violence is viewed as a possible precursor to adult intimate-partner violence. Andra Tharp, a health scientist with the CDC's violence prevention division, said two-way teen dating violence - with both partners engaging in abuse - is widespread. She said it's an ongoing challenge among experts in the field to find the right balance in addressing the role of gender - exploring the extent to which both boys and girls are perpetrators, while identifying situations where girls are likely to suffer more serious harm. For example, Ms Tharp said that if a boyfriend retaliates against a girlfriend who hit him, there's a higher risk of injury to the girl if - as is likely - the boy is stronger. Dr Elizabeth Miller, chief of adolescent medicine at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC, said it's important to make distinctions about the types of abuse. She contends that, while boys and girls may engage in psychological abuse at comparable levels, girls are more likely to be the victims in cases of sexual violence and coercion. 'When you look at the need for medical attention, females are experiencing more severe consequences,' she said. 'We're doing ourselves a disservice if we pretend it's all the same.' While many girls are capable of aggressive behavior, they generally don't share the view of some boys that sexual coercion is acceptable, Dr Miller said. The research by Ms Mumford and Mr Taylor is expected to be published soon in The Journal of Interpersonal Violence, a peer reviewed academic journal.",A survey at the University of Chicago also found that 20per cent of teens reported themselves as victims of physical and sexual abuse in dating relationships .
"Tourists are being sold heroin test kits in Amsterdam, starting on Friday, following the death of  three Britons who died after snorting a drug they thought to be cocaine. 'Starting tomorrow the test kits will be sold in 30 smart shops which will show the presence of heroin in drugs,' the Amsterdam-based daily Het Parool said on Thursday. 'Tourists can also buy these test kits for two euros (£1.56) from street teams,' the paper added. A warning sign on the street in Amsterdam about the sale of 'extremely dangerous cocaine' to tourists . Last week two British men, aged 20 and 21, died after they snorted 'white heroin', an illicit drug it is understood they believed was cocaine. The men reportedly bought the drug from a dealer in the street in Amsterdam and were later found in a hotel room in the south of the city. The pair's death comes less than a month after another 22-year-old tourist, also from the UK, was found dead following a similar incident. Police have revealed another  17 cases, at least, involving tourists taking the so called 'white heroin' and needing medical attention. Respiratory failure is among the drug's primary side effects. Electronic signboards have been displayed with the warning: 'Extremely dangerous cocaine is sold to tourists'. Amsterdam authorities are on high alert after the death of three British tourists after they took 'white heroin' - this sign just outside the Red Light District on the Nieuwmarkt is among many warning of the dangers . As police carry out intensive investigations into the drug's dealer or dealers, Amsterdam mayor Eberhard van der Laan has backed the selling of the kits in 'smart shops' which also sell legal herbal 'smart' drugs. The mayor warned though that the heroin test kits 'should not be seen as fail proof.' 'Users will clearly be told that the test is not a guarantee that the drugs they bought are safe to use,' he said. A campaign warns tourists of the risks of buying drugs from street dealers and heroin test kits are being sold . While supporting the kits may invite criticism of Amsterdam's notoriously tolerant attitude to drug use, Van der Laan said: 'Not doing anything would be bad for the city.' 'Amsterdam will do anything to prevent more victims. This is the least we can do,' he said. While the sale of cannabis is permitted in Amsterdam coffee shops, hard drugs are illegal in the Netherlands. White heroin is historically produced in southeast Asia's 'Golden Triangle' spanning Laos, Thailand and Cambodia and is generally purer and more expensive than brown heroin.","Two British tourists died in Amsterdam last week after taking 'white heroin'

"Jamie Vardy has scored against a United from Manchester before. Not the club boasting a single player worth almost £60million, however, but the one formed in 2005 by fans unhappy about the Glazer family takeover. ‘A tap-in in front of 4,000 fans,’ recalled 27-year-old Vardy on Sunday night, fresh from vanquishing far greater adversaries with his searing pace and aggression. That 4-1 victory for Halifax Town in the Northern Premier League Premier Division came on New Year’s Day 2011, and the crowd (4,023 to be exact) was the largest in the division’s history — swollen because of the relative size of each club. Jamie Vardy celebrates his goal against Manchester United which capped off a stellar display . Vardy took his goal with the look of an experienced Premier League striker but has come a long way quickly . Halifax finished as champions that season, but Vardy, then 24, was out-scored in the strikers’ chart by Ross Hannah of Matlock Town (35 goals to 24). Hannah is now at Grimsby Town, no small climb itself, but Vardy’s trajectory is on another gradient altogether. He was at Halifax for only a year. Before that, between 2003 and 2010, he played for Stocksbridge Park Steels on the eighth rung of the football ladder, having been released by Sheffield Wednesday for being too small. ‘When I signed for Stocksbridge I was only 17, getting kicked left, right, and centre by fully-grown blokes,’ Vardy remembered while clutching his man-of-the-match award. ‘That toughens you up. When it comes to games like this, they are always going to try get in your face — it doesn’t faze me one bit.’ Vardy was scoring in non-League football as recently as 2012 but has made incredible progress at Leicester . Leicester City striker Vardy congratulates Leonardo Ulloa after creating the Argentine's first goal . Vardy won the penalty which got Leicester back into the game, tumbling under the challenge of Rafael . In his early years at Stocksbridge, a town of 17,000 people in north Sheffield, Vardy was under curfew and obliged to wear an electronic tag on his ankle after being charged with assault. He was struggling to cope with the anguish at seeing his golden opportunity in the game seemingly disappear. ‘When I was released by Wednesday I thought that was it,’ said Vardy in an interview last year. ‘There were some hard times. It wasn’t nice wearing the tag and it’s not good having to be in your house at 6pm every night. ‘I was sticking up for a mate who was deaf and somebody was taking the p*** out of him for wearing a hearing aid. They got thrown out of the pub but they were waiting for us an hour and half later. ‘They started attacking him and I wasn’t going to stand there and let him take a beating. I learned from that and from that stage things started looking up.’ During his time at Stocksbridge, where the ground holds 3,500 people, Leicester manager Nigel Pearson, who lives in the Sheffield area, would watch him play as he plundered 66 goals in 107 league games. Vardy is extremely popular with both his teammates and the Leicester fans and is rewarding their faith . Vardy was a constant handful, sometimes literally as Chris Smalling shows, for the Manchester United defence . ‘We’ve known about him since then,’ said Pearson in March. ‘A long, long time.’ Vardy went from Halifax to Conference National side Fleetwood Town in 2011 and 31 goals in 36 league games later, Pearson finally made his move. Leicester paid £1m for his signature, a record for a non-League player, in May 2012. ‘It was probably more than we’d have liked to have paid,’ admitted Pearson, ‘but it was needed when there were four or five other Championship sides who wanted to sign him all of a sudden.’ Another signpost in Vardy’s remarkable story is that he scored twice in the Blue Square Premier against Lincoln as recently as April 2012. In his first season at Leicester Vardy struggled severely to adjust and has said he almost quit as a result of heavy criticism. But last season he came back fitter and was a major reason behind the Foxes’ march to the Championship title, scoring 16 goals. Vardy has come a long way from playing non-League football in 2012 to sinking Manchester United on Sunday . Vardy is brought down by Tyler Blackett, leaving to the United defender's red card and Leicester's fifth goal . He is an immensely popular member of the dressing room, earning the nickname Cannon more for his explosive sense of humour than powerful shooting, it appears. ‘I’m a bit of a nut-job in the changing room,’ laughed Vardy last night having out-performed Radamel Falcao, Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie. ‘We’ve all had different routes. Mine was a bit worse but I’ve managed to make my way up that pyramid. I couldn’t tell you what league I started at.’ Vardy paid tribute to his manager for having faith. ‘It was a massive gamble but hopefully now I’m repaying him.’","Jamie Vardy scored one and made four as Leicester beat Manchester United .

"Roy Keane has revealed he turned down the chance to succeed Neil Lennon as Celtic manager in the summer because the Parkhead club failed to make him feel wanted enough. The former Manchester United midfielder was left disappointed by a take it or leave it contract offer packed full of unappealing clauses that 'failed to rock my boat’. The inflexible and cut-price nature of the negotiations over the manager’s job with the Scottish champions reminded Keane of the club playing on his affections when negotiating his deal to sign as a player in 2005. Roy Keane played for Celtic between 2005 and 2006 but turned down the chance to manage the club . Keane, pictured here in his testimonial match in 2006, said Celtic didn't make him feel wanted this summer . An unimpressed Keane was left thinking: ‘They were playing the part — 'It’s Celtic' — you should almost go up there for nothing. ‘Celtic wanted me but they weren’t showing how much they wanted me.’ And a non-negotiable decision to appoint his right-hand-man — thought to be under-pressure current boss Ronny Deila — also left the fiery Irishman feeling Celtic had doubts over his ability, even though he had been offered the job by majority shareholder Dermot Desmond. Speaking in his new autobiography The Second Half, the 43-year-old recalled the moment Celtic made their move in late May. ‘I got a call: would I go and have a chat with Dermot Desmond? I’d met him once before, in 2005, when I was signing to play for Celtic. ‘I met him for a cup of tea. It was in the middle of an international week, in Dublin. Keane believes Celtic thought the club's reputation on its own would be enough to lure him back to Parkhead . ‘At the end of the chat, he said: 'The job is yours'. ‘It was all pretty straightforward. There would be one or two restrictions, about staff. They had already picked the man who would be my assistant and they were insisting on him. ‘It didn’t scare me off but it did get me thinking. It wasn’t an ideal start. Were they doubting me already? ‘I came back to the team hotel and spoke to Martin (O’Neill). I told him I would have a think about it. ‘We (the Republic of Ireland) had a game against Italy at Craven Cottage in London on the following Saturday. After turning down the Celtic manager's job, Keane joined Aston Villa as Paul Lambert's assistant manager . ‘The fact I had spoken to Dermot Desmond had become public knowledge. ‘It had to, because Martin had a press conference and a few things had been leaked — as usual. ‘I was delighted. It was a massive compliment. Over the years, I had always said: “If you’re offered the Celtic job, you don’t turn it down”. ‘I was in a predicament ...and my gut feeling was saying: 'You’re on your own with this one'. Keane's  book is as fiery as his first autobiography . ‘I asked Paul Gilroy, the League Managers’ Association lawyer, to speak to Celtic to discuss terms. Money hadn’t been mentioned yet. ‘I got in touch with Celtic’s chief executive, Peter Lawwell and asked him to give me a ballpark figure before negotiations got going. ‘He mentioned a figure and he said: 'But that’s it'. Paul told me there were a lot of clauses in the contract that he wasn’t happy with. And the figures were non-negotiable. ‘I got my head around that. But it felt a bit too familiar. I had been down this road before when I signed for Celtic as a player. ‘I felt they wanted me but they weren’t showing how much they wanted me. ‘We played Italy on the Saturday and I had a message on my phone on Sunday from Dermot Desmond. ‘They wanted a heads-up by tomorrow, Monday. ‘I thought about the Celtic offer. It wasn’t rocking my boat. ‘They weren’t convincing me: 'Listen, you’re the man for us'. ‘I went to Paul Gilroy’s house (on Sunday night). There were things I wasn’t happy with in the contract. But I know if you examined every clause too carefully, you would never sign anything. ‘I rang Dermot Desmond on the Monday and said: 'I’m really honoured you offered me the job but I want to stay with Martin'.’ Keane would later take up an offer to coach at Aston Villa under former Celtic captain Paul Lambert. But he denied that any such potential job offers were behind his decision to turn down Celtic. He also spoke of his dismay that Celtic did not prove flexible enough to persuade him to change his mind when he turned down their initial unacceptable offer. The new book reveals how badly Keane fell out with former Manchester United  boss Sir Alex Ferguson . He said: ‘Had Celtic shown enough in their negotiating, 'we’ll move this, you can take that' — a bit of give and take — I might have hesitated. ‘They just didn’t show me that they wanted me and I was happier staying in the Ireland job. ‘Working with Martin had given me back a love of the game and I’m all for showing a bit of loyalty. ‘I had only been in the job two minutes. We hadn’t played a competitive game yet. ‘I felt powerful saying: 'No'. I felt good. But I wondered if I was making the right decision. ‘Right job, wrong time.’ Roy Keane: The Second Half, published by Weidenfeld and Nicolson. £20. www.orionbooks.co.uk .","Roy Keane claims he turned down the Celtic manager's job this summer .

"An Australian woman has told in graphic detail of the moment she was allegedly sexually assaulted twice during a Malaysia Airlines flight by a chief steward whilst he was on duty. Laura Bushney was flying from Kuala Lumpur to Paris on August 4 when her alleged attacker Mohammed Rosli Bin Ab Karim put his hands under a blanket and into her pants. But this is a claim which the 54-year-old has denied as he told police that Ms Bushney did not resist him. It was three hours into flight MH20 when the 26-year-old's nightmare began. Scroll down for video . Laura Bushney boarded a Malaysia Airlines flight on August 4 which was when she was allegedly sexually assaulted by a chief steward . The alleged attacker Mohammed Rosli Bin Ab Karim put his hands under a blanket and into the Australian passenger's pants whilst he was on duty . Ms Bushney claims 54-year-old Rosli, a father of three, sexually assaulted her twice . captured audio and video recordings of the alleged assault and the later confrontation with her alleged attacker . Ms Bushney wept as she recounted the terrifying moments to Channel Seven's Sunday Night program. She claimed Rosli touched her upper thigh before putting his hands under her clothing, using the excuse that he was 'comforting her'. She insisted he touched her genitals and then digitally raped her. 'I just keep saying ""Why didn't I scream, why didn't I shout?' she said. 'I am a strong person because I can do that, I know I can. But when I was in the moment, I couldn't. I felt so scared and petrified.' At the time Ms Rosli, who was flying to Paris to join her boyfriend, was curled up at the back of the plane in row 81, with her head against the window and empty seats beside her. It was then that Rosli sat on the aisle seat and told her, in answer to her question, that it would be another nine hours before the plane touched down in Paris. But something about his behaviour caused her concern. The victim was seated at the back of the plane when the alleged sexual assaults occurred . 'He grabbed my hand and told me to lie down and relax,' she said. 'I asked him to get me something to drink. I wanted to get him away from me. I didn’t feel comfortable. 'He came back and then he moved my legs and put them on his lap. I felt shocked, I didn't know what to do. I didn’t know what to say. And then he started rubbing my legs.' After Rosli walked away, Ms Bushney managed to confide in one of the closest seated passengers - Canadian national Sophie Lachance - in row 88. 'I saw her face full of tears,' she told Sunday Night. 'She literally told me, ""this man put his hands in my pants"".' It was Ms Lachance who urged the distraught Ms Bushney to report the incident to police. Although Ms Bushney didn't say anything to Rosli, when asked if she made it clear to him that what he was doing was wrong she replied that he 'started moving his hands down, moving his hands down towards my belly button and I pushed his hands away and he started to massage my legs'. 'I thought by pushing it away that I was telling him that I didn't want it to happen,' she said. As the assault was continuing, she managed to record the incident under a blanket, as well as filming video on her phone of an altercation she had with Rosli after the incident. She says in the phone recording: 'He's massaging my legs, I'm so scared I just want to get off this plane.' Rosli, she said, walked away but half an hour later he came back to the same seat and once again moved her outstretched legs onto his legs. Ms Bushney managed to confide in one of the closest seated passengers - Canadian national Sophie Lachance . 'I could feel that he has got an erection and he is rubbing himself up against me,' she said. 'He put his hands inside my pants…He put his fingers inside me. 'That's rape,’ the TV interviewer tells her. 'Yes,' she agreed through her tears. Asked if she had tried to stop him, she replied: 'No.' 'As soon as it happened he got up and I think the thought process of what he had done…he realised what he had done…it had happened so fast that I was absolutely frozen,' she said. The 54-year-old begged for Ms Bushney's forgiveness and asked her not to report the incidents . Rosli, a married man and a father of three, joined Malaysia Airlines in 1980. After the assault, Ms Bushney made a handwritten complaint to other cabin crew members, detailing what had happened. Ms Bushney was moved to a first class seat and at one point the captain came to speak to her. But neither he nor his team stopped the chief steward from approaching her yet again. 'I asked for him to be taken away, I didn’t want him anywhere near me,'  she said. Yet her requested was not heeded. A video recording, made on Ms Bushney's phone, showed Rosli sitting in a seat on the other side of the aisle, shaking his head, putting his hands to his face, or looking down at the floor as she accused him of putting his hand inside her pants. Then she can be heard saying to the steward: 'I don't want to see you, go away you give me the creeps, you dirty old man.' 'How could you do it?' she is heard asking him through her cries of despair. 'I am so scared. I want to get off this plane.' During this confrontation, Rosli can be seen begging for Ms Bushney's forgiveness asking her to give him 'a second chance'. Rosli is then heard saying: 'I am so sorry. I am so sorry ma'am.' The steward is currently detained by French police and is expected to face trial in France in six or seven months time . Malaysia Airlines has responded with a public statement but has not contacted Ms Bushney or offered an apology, any counseling or compensation . At Paris airport, Rosli was taken away for questioning and she was taken for a physical examination and a DNA swab. However an airline official in Paris told her that if she filed a report that was not true she could get into serious trouble. Despite the warning, Ms Bushney went ahead and informed French police. After 14 hours of questioning, she was required to confront Rosli one last time. When she accused him of raping her, Rosli told police that was not his intentions. 'He said that he never intended to do that and he said that I didn't resist him,' she said. Malaysia Airlines has responded with a public statement that confirmed the allegations. But they failed to offer an apology, any counseling or compensation to Ms Bushney. 'Malaysia Airlines can confirm that following allegations by a passenger travelling on flight MH20 from Kuala Lumpur to Paris on 4th August 2014 of inappropriate sexual behaviour by a member of the cabin crew, the member of staff in question has been detained for questioning by the French police.' 'Malaysia Airlines expects and accepts nothing short of the highest standards of conduct from its crew and takes any such allegations very seriously.'

"They are the most precious moments of family life... and are meant to be private. But these pictures of a baby in its cot and a tot being fed in a high chair are among images broadcast on a Russian website. The site has hacked hundreds of security cameras in Britain connected to the internet. Scroll down for video . Invasive: A baby being fed in a high chair are among images broadcast on a rogue Russian website . Private: A baby is seen in its cot on the website, which intercept and broadcast live pictures from homes . This allows it to intercept and broadcast live pictures from homes, gardens and driveways, and stream footage from workplaces, pubs, shops and gyms across the country. After the Daily Mail revealed the rogue website’s existence yesterday – and the data protection watchdog warned the public to protect their home CCTV and webcams from hackers – there was outrage around the globe at the invasion of privacy. The site carries nearly 600 video feeds from homes and businesses in the UK, along with postcodes apparently showing the location. They are among more than 10,000 it has hacked worldwide. Astonishingly, as the Mail revealed, the site – which crashed last night – features adverts sponsored by the British Government, meaning taxpayers are inadvertently paying to be spied upon. The adverts are for an online security campaign, Cyberstreetwise.com, which is designed to encourage people to be safer online. Last night ministers admitted it was ‘totally unacceptable’ for government adverts to appear on the site, and ordered that they be taken down. International problem: The site carries nearly 600 video feeds from homes and businesses in the UK, along with postcodes apparently showing the location. They are among more than 10,000 it has hacked worldwide . Critics said the revelation was ‘almost beyond satire’. Emma Carr, director of Big Brother Watch, said: ‘The public will just about accept that there is little that can be done to tackle these foreign hacking sites. The Government should absolutely know where public money is going and it certainly shouldn’t be helping to keep these sorts of sites active.’ Yesterday the Information Commissioner, Christopher Graham, warned it may take some time to get the site shut down, because of where it is based. He said images of children were unsettling and that it was up to parents to set up passwords to stop unauthorised remote access to cameras linked to the web. 'Beyond satire': The site features adverts sponsored by the British Government, meaning taxpayers are inadvertently paying to be spied upon. The adverts are for an online security campaign, Cyberstreetwise.com . He urged owners to change their passwords from manufacturers’ default settings so hackers could not break into them easily. Mr Graham said he was working with foreign agencies to combat the site, which appeared to be using an Australian domain name bought via an American company. He told BBC Breakfast footage of children in bed was ‘spooky’ but added: ‘It is the responsibility of the parents to set a proper password if you want remote access.’ Manufacturers said yesterday that the latest cameras gave users a warning if they did not change the default password. Last night Minister for Organised Crime Karen Bradley said: ‘It is clearly totally unacceptable that advertising from the cross-government Cyber Streetwise campaign was placed on the Russian website.

"Britons are set to spend a whopping £19billion on Christmas presents -  but a new survey reveals what we really want from our loved ones is a holiday. Travel and entertainment deals provider Travelzoo released findings today suggesting that while accumulating material possessions does not bring lasting happiness – spending hard-earned cash on experiences does. The survey polled over 2000 UK adults to find out which of their purchases over the past year have brought them the most pleasure and enjoyment, and also what they were most hoping to receive for Christmas this year. Top of the pleasure and enjoyment scale are holidays – 81 per cent of people stated that money spent on jetting away gave them the best money/happiness ratio. In second place was live events such as concerts (69 per cent) and in third place was fine dining, with 56 per cent of people saying this had brought them the most enjoyment from their expense. Louise Hodges, head of communications at Travelzoo said, 'We're seeing a real trend in people wanting to spend their money on presents that enable their loved ones to do amazing things and create memories, rather than accumulate more material possessions – or even worse, gifts that end up being returned or exchanged.' The infographic shows experience gifts such as holidays, concerts and spa days are well received .","A survey by Travelzoo reveals 'experience' presents are most popular .

"Islamic State extremists have set up a new learning centre in Syria dubbed 'Osama Bin Laden' school. The religious school, named after the mastermind of the the 9/11 attacks and former leader of Al Qaeda, has been set up in a town held by ISIS militants. It comes as new pictures emerged showing the beheading of three civilians in Raqqa, another of Islamic State’s strongholds in the war-torn country. Scroll down for video . Brutal: Pictures have emerged showing the beheading of three civilians in Raqqa, one of Islamic State’s strongholds in Syria . Disturbing: An executioner holds his sword aloft as armed guards watch on in front of an all-male crowd . The public executions were carried out with the victims accused of 'cursing God' and committing 'sorcery'. The school has been opened in Manbij, a small ISIS held town in northern Syria. The facility has already started religious instruction classes for residents living in the town, offering classes in Islamic State’s extremist brand of Sharia law. A short propaganda video was also released by the provincial media branch of Islamic State. The five minute film, entitled 'Sharia Educational Session for the Teachers', features brief interviews with a few residents of Manbij, discussing their opinions about the apparent positive benefits of the new religious school. Manbij was once a Free Syrian Army (FSA) stronghold before it was overrun by ISIS. Several young children can be seen watching from the front of the crowd while a number of masked gunmen also appear to be standing guard, monitoring the execution . The three civilians were reportedly put to death in the ISIS stronghold of Raqqa for 'cursing God' and 'sorcery' Fierce fighting with the FSA forced ISIS into its first withdrawal in January 2014. However the extremist group regrouped and re-captured the strategic town 18 days later. Kurdish forces have repeatedly tried to capture the town but have come up short against tough Islamic State resistance. The Kurds have recently called upon the Free Syrian Army to join them in their efforts to re-take Manbij. In a rare act of defiance, locals in Manbij even demonstrated against Islamic State in May 2014, angered at the militant group’s harsh rule of governance over the city. However the town remains under control of the extremist group. Any rare acts of rebellion or questioning of Islamic State have always been brutally dealt with by the extremist group. Recent photos of the execution of three civilians for 'cursing God' and 'sorcery' epitomise the brutal regime being maintained by Islamic State. The victims were beheaded in front of a crowd of Muslims 'to serve as a deterrent to those who dare to criticise Allah,' it has been reported. An IS fighter, wearing a black balaclava, reads out the victims' crimes through a small black handheld microphone . The images show a large all-male crowd standing near a square in the city, where corporal punishments, like beheadings and crucifixions, have previously been carried out for crimes against the Islamic State . The images show a large all-male crowd standing near the main square in Raqqa, where corporal punishments, like beheadings and crucifixions, have previously been carried out for crimes against the Islamic State. Several young children can be seen watching from the front of the crowd while a number of masked gunmen also appear to be standing guard, monitoring the execution. One photo shows an IS fighter, wearing a black balaclava, reading out the victims' crimes through a small black handheld microphone. All three of the victims are shown wearing a red blindfold and have their hands tied behind their back. They appear to have been individually led to the execution block, a crude hand cut log with a raised notch for the victims to rest their head on. A religious school, named after former Al Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden (pictured), has been set up in a town in Syria held by ISIS militants . The black flag of Islamic State can be seen flying from a tall flag pole in the background, near one of the main streets. The executor is masked and wearing a pair of sandy-coloured military issue boots. The photos show the executioner holding a curved sword above his head. A small blood trail can be seen near the back of a nearby pick up truck. Its white boot has been left open so the bodies can be taken away from the execution site. Like Minbaj, Raqqa has been one of the main bombing targets by the US-led coalition last month. The headquarters of Islamic State were reportedly bombed yesterday in Raqqa. The building, situated in the southern part of the city had been evacuated and no militants were reported to have been killed in the nine air strikes on the city. Questions have been raised about the effectiveness of the air strikes with the British based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights reporting that the recent strikes on Manbij had been a failure.","Islamic State militants have set up 'Osama Bin Laden' school in Manbij, Syria .

"Formula One has never been confused for the Trappist Order, and so it proved again in the humid paddock on Friday when the sport’s equivalent of contemplative silence — an extensive ban on radio transmissions — was abolished before it had started. So in Sunday's Singapore Grand Prix teams will be allowed to send drivers advice from the pit wall to the cockpit, farcically reversing an edict that was being trumpeted by no less than Bernie Ecclestone only 24 hours earlier. However, there are limits to what the boffins can tell the drivers to do. Messages about the cars’ cutting-edge technology can still be relayed on radio. Coaching them in where to change gear or brake or accelerate are not. Teams will be able to communicate with drivers over radio at the Singapore Grand Prix . F1 supremo Bernie Ecclestone, pictured with wife Fabiana Flosi, had earlier backed calls for a ban . The Marina Bay Circuit will stage round 14 of this season's race for the F1 world drivers' championships . Hurrah for that, at least. The 22 track jockeys, multi-millionaires among them, are the cream of a billion drivers in the world. In a statement, the FIA said: ‘It seems to us that information being passed to the driver concerning the performance of his car should be separated from information concerning his own performance. Why the change? The teams argued that safety would be imperilled if the full rule change was rushed through. Some thought they could be disadvantaged. Race director Charlie Whiting said: ‘It became clear that some teams would be seriously hampered compared to others, not just in their know-how or ability to react in the short term, but also with hardware choices that were made a year ago. ‘Two types of dashboard were available to the teams, and one can show a great deal more than the other. So in the interest of fairness we felt it would be better to introduce it in two stages and that is what we have done now.’ Drivers like Lewis Hamilton will be able to receive car performance information but not racing tips . Hamilton was fastest during practice at the Marina Bay Circuit ahead of Sunday's race . Reigning world champion Sebastian Vettel keeps in touch with mechanics as he walks the pit lane . Instead, the full set of restrictions will be in place next season. Let’s hope the matter is carefully considered rather than hastily introduced and even more hurriedly rescinded as has happened here. So what precisely is still banned? Teams will not be able to tell a driver how his line, use of kerbs, cornering technique compares to another competitor or in what way his gear selection differs from anyone else’s. Nico Rosberg (Ger)                    238pts . Lewis Hamilton (GB)                   216 . Daniel Ricciardo (A)                   166 . Valtteri Bottas (Fin)                    122 . Fernando Alonso (Sp)                121 . He cannot be advised where to brake or apply the throttle or when to use of his drag reduction system or other overtake buttons. What punishment will be imposed? That is yet to be decided. A stop-go penalty — holding a driver in the pit lane — or moving him down the grid are possibilities. That is for the stewards to decide, though Whiting said the sanction would be ‘sporting rather than financial’. There are potential problems in this. For example, will the race be subject to long post-race stewards’ verdicts? Will teams deliver messages in code or accuse rivals of doing so? However, generally, the move to greater restrictions is positive. Drivers are the stars of motor racing and to denude them of their power undermines the allure of the sport. ‘This is not PlayStation,’ said Force India’s owner and team principal Vijay Mallya. ‘These rules that drivers should not be aided have been around for a long time but they have been abused for a long time, and this gets us back to that.’ In practice on Friday, with Lewis Hamilton fastest, there was only minor confusion. Drivers occasionally asked for information but had to be denied it. British and German press have differing notions over whether ban will favour Hamilton or Nico Rosberg . Championship leader Nico Rosberg towels off in the garage during a practice session . Jenson Button claims that communication restrictions will favour hard working drivers . The most important question is how the new ruling will impact on the fight for the world drivers’ title between Hamilton and Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg. Amusingly, the majority view in the German papers was that the changes favoured Rosberg, the more thoughtful of the two, while in Britain Hamilton was largely thought to be at an advantage because he is the more natural racer who does not need instructions to find speed. There is logic to both theories. Jenson Button said hard-working drivers would be rewarded, and that sounded a reasonable appraisal. Rosberg was hampered in practice when the red flag was waved when Pastor Maldonado crashed his Lotus, stopping his qualifying simulation lap. He ended up 13th in the time-sheets, just over a second-and-a-half behind Hamilton. Pastor Maldonado climbs out of his car after crashing during practice, an incident that hampered Rosberg . Maldonado's Lotus car is removed from the track by marshals after the Venezuelan's crash . Another factor is the conditions. The race is long at nearly two hours and, even though it is held in the night, humidity and heat are oppressive. The drivers were dripping wet as they conducted their post-qualifying media engagements last night. Hamilton, who trails Rosberg by 22 points, is supported here by his father Anthony and stepmother Linda — putting him in touch at this crucial stage of the season with the man who shaped his career. Hamilton said: ‘They said they wanted to come, so I said yeah. I doubt they will be at every race but it is good to have their positivity. You have to keep the faith. There is never any question. It’s been like that since I was eight years old. I woke up believing that I could win the race and the championship. That was always our mentality. Me and my dad.’ Vettel still holds the lap record of 1:48.574 sec at the Singapore Grand Prix .","F1 teams will be allowed to speak to drivers during Singapore Grand Prix .

"It seems there is nowhere Google Maps hasn't reached, from mountain tops to ocean floors. But now the map has offered a new service, letting culture vultures tour 13 iconic National Trust properties from the comfort of their own homes. A collection of historic country houses and outstanding landscapes from the UK have been added to Google Street View in partnership with the National Trust. St Michael's Mount; This iconic rocky island is home to a community of just over 30 islanders and boasts its very own subtropical garden and legend of Jack the Giant Killer . Lyveden New Bield; The Tresham family who owned the estate were involved in the infamous Gunpowder Plot . Trelissick Garden; Trelissick is situated on its very own peninsula with ever changing views of the estuary of the River Fal . The sites that can be toured include Montacute House, which will represent Greenwich Palace, Henry VIII's main London seat and the site of Anne Boleyn's arrest, in the forthcoming BBC Two series Wolf Hall and Bring Up the Bodies. Stourhead House, the inspiration for Lady Penelope's residence in the original Thunderbirds puppet series in the 1960s and Formby, one of the only places in the UK where the rare red squirrel can be spotted. Tom Barker, head of digital at the National Trust, said: 'We're delighted to team up with Google to showcase online some of the special properties and places we look after on behalf of the nation. 'At the heart of our charitable purpose is the principle of opening up the countryside and the historic homes in our care to everyone, forever. It's great that this technology will allow so many people wherever they are in the world to get a taste of what visiting some of the nation's most beautiful places is like.'

"These photographs show a killer black bear as it closes in on its victim, a 22-year-old student who tried to flee but was caught and mauled by the creature. The images were taken by Darsh Patel, a senior year student who died in September while hiking with friends in New Jersey. Police officers - who found the bear standing guard over his corpse before they shot it dead - recovered the photographs from his phone, which seemed to have been bitten by the bear. Scroll down for video . Killer: This bear, photographed by its victim Darsh Patel, 22, killed him while he was hiking with his friends . Close-up: The 302-pound bear followed at a distance first, then closed on Patel and his friends . Recovered: The cellphone photographs were released by officers, who found the phone with a bite mark near Patel's corpse . They show the 302-pound creature around 100ft away in the woods of the Apshawa Preserve, around an hour's drive north of Rutgers University, where Patel was a student. Patel - the first victim of a New Jersey bear attack in 150 years - was hiking with four friends when he encountered the bear, according to NJ.com. The group had been warned about the bear by hikers heading away from it - but went closer to take a look. Killed: Rutgers student Darsh Patel, 22, was killed . Patel and his friends turned around when the bear got within 300ft, but it kept following. When it got to within 15 feet, the group split up and fled. The hikers say Patel lost one of his shoes during the hike, and was 'extremely winded' when the group split up. They last saw him climbing some rocks in an attempt to get away from the bear. He shouted for them to keep running. After they fled, the group called police, who found Patel's mauled corpse being guarded by the beast. It was behaving aggressively, so officers killed it with two shotgun blasts: one to the shoulder and another to the jaw. Later DNA tests found bits of cloth in the bear's stomach, as well as Patel's DNA around its mouth and claws. Patel is believed to be the first human killed by a bear in New Jersey.","Darsh Patel, a student at Rutgers University, was killed in September .

"A bright flash of light and booming noises in a cramped seat thousands of feet in the air would be enough to put off even the most hardened fliers. But passengers landing at Birmingham airport on Friday afternoon were led by example as their captain coolly steered them through three lightning blasts and left it until afterwards to calmly explain what happened. Passengers spoke of a 'massive bang' as one of the bolts struck the body of the KLM service from Amsterdam, but the blasts had no effect on the landing, which proceeded as normal to touch down at 4.30pm. Scroll down for video . Thunderstruck: These huge bolts of electricity struck the KLM flight as it came in to land over Birmingham . Bolts: The plane can be seen at the centre of the blasts of electricity . And after the plane, a Boeing 737, had touched down on the . runway, the captain confirmed to his passengers that the service had . been hit, saying simply: 'Ladies and gentlemen, you may have noticed we . were hit by lightning.' Tony Everitt, 51, was one of 174 passengers on board the flight, from which ominous 'dark skies' could be seen just before the first bolt struck. The businessman, who was returning from a conference, said: 'It was incredible - there was one . massive bang. Only moments before, I’d noticed the dark skies and told a . passenger sitting next to me that I was surprised there was no thunder . and lightning. 'After the bang, my initial thought was the engine had blown-up. Surprisingly, it wasn’t frightening, it was exciting. 'You are waiting for something else to happen, then you realise nothing has gone wrong.' Coming in to land: The flight touched down without any problems at Birmingham Airport on Friday . The picture of the plane, caught up in the centre of several branches of a lightning bolt, was taken by Tracy Meakin White, 42, who was watching the storm. She said: 'I didn’t even see the plane at first, I was just clicking on my phone and then afterwards I saw the aircraft. 'I . think it is a once in a lifetime picture, I doubt I will see anything . like that again, I am not a photographer, it was just a stroke of luck I . got the shot.' A statement from KLM said: 'Occasionally . aircraft is hit multiple times by lightning. All pilots and air crew are . trained to deal with this.' A spokesman for Birmingham Airport said: 'All aircraft landed safely without incident on Friday afternoon.' Although it may sound a terrifying prospect, commercial aircraft around the world are bombarded with bolts of lightning every single day. According to experts, the in an average year any given airliner can expect to be struck at least once on its travels. Indeed, . as the fuselage of most planes is made of conductive aluminium, their . presence in storm clouds, where huge amounts of static electricity . gather, can actually trigger the discharges. But . due to strict regulations, all passenger planes must be built with . electrical shielding which protects the inside of the plane from the . effects of lightning bolts. Those on board often fail to notice that the plane has been hit at all, or experience nothing more than a quick flash. It . is estimated that aircraft shielding is strong enough to withstand . voltages ten times the amount of a typical bolt, and no planes have been . brought down by lightning since 1967. The . worst which can usually be expected from a lightning blast is a visible . scorch mark.

"Hit TV series Game of Thrones generated more than £8.6 million worth of publicity for Northern Ireland this year, tourism bosses have revealed. Executives at Tourism Ireland were quick to capitalise on the global success of the HBO series, much of which is filmed on location in the region. They launched an 11-week international marketing campaign in April this year after HBO allowed the programme’s name and logo to be used in the tourism campaign. Dunluce Castle in County Antrim, Northern Ireland represents House of Greyjoy, ruler of the Iron Islands . It was unrolled on Twitter and Facebook in North America and Europe, including Great Britain, United States, Canada, France, Germany, Spain, Italy, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, and was aimed at targeting the show’s 14m viewers. It ran for just 11 weeks between April and June this year and received 100million hits online. Despite costing just £200,000 to create, executives say that reaching such a large audience would normally have cost almost £9million, making it Tourism Ireland's most successful ever campaign. As well as the Titanic Studios in Belfast, locations including the Cushendun caves, Murlough Bay, Ballintoy Harbour, and Larrybane have all provided backdrops for the drama. Tourism Ireland hope the success of the advertising push will increase overseas visitor numbers to more than two million a year by 2016 and generate more than £550 million for the local economy. Niall Gibbons, chief executive of Tourism Ireland, said: ‘The campaign cost us £200,000. If we were to buy the publicity, that would have cost us £8.6 million. Ballintoy Harbor, a small village in Northern Ireland, is used to represent the Iron Islands in the HBO series . Located in North East County Antrim, Murlough Bay was transformed into the setting for Storm's End fortress . Castle Ward in Co. Down was transformed from a 17th century house into the fictional castle of Winterfell . ‘It was the most successful Twitter campaign that we have ever run - and we have run a lot of them. ‘It allowed us to sell Northern Ireland to an audience who wouldn't have heard of it before.’ Game of Thrones has been shot in a variety of locations including Morocco, Iceland, Malta and Croatia. However, the majority of filming took place in Northern Ireland, where the rugged landscape provided a stunning scenic backdrop. The series has thrown the spotlight on beauty spots such as the Dark Hedges and Ballintoy harbour in north Antrim as well as Castle Ward in Co Down. Game of Thrones is one of a number of large-scale productions to have been filmed in Northern Ireland over the past decade. Others include Dracula Untold and the BBC drama series The Fall. Downhill Beach in Co. Londonderry is home to Mussenden – a tiny temple perched dramatically on a 120ft cliff top, high above the Atlantic Ocean. It was used as the location for Dragonstone in Season 2 of the hit series. Downhill Beach in Co.

Antrim provided the location for Storm's End castle, while Dark Hedges, also in Co. Antrim was used as the setting for Kingsroad, the fictional highway running up to the city of King’s Landing. Castle Ward, Co. Down was the location used to depict Winterfell castle in the series. The setting for Robb Stark's camp was Audley's Field in Strangford Lough, while River Quoile in Co. Down was used as the backdrop for Riverrun. Dark Hedges in Co. Antrim was used as the setting for Kingsroad, the fictional highway running up to the city of King’s Landing .

Down was transformed into the Haunted Forest, while Beric Dondarrion's hideout was shot at Pollnagollum Cave in Co. Fermanagh. Mr Gibbons said the organisation had ambitious plans to promote Northern Ireland as a must-see destination. He added: ‘Following a successful 2014, ambitious targets have been set for 2015. ‘We will continue to highlight iconic experiences all over Northern Ireland, including Titanic Belfast, the Giant's Causeway and our unique National Trust properties. ‘The Causeway Coastal Route and driving holidays to Northern Ireland will also be promoted widely. ‘Next year we will be working hard to maximise tourism potential of the Irish Open at Royal County Down and the return of the Tall Ships to Belfast, as well as the opening up of the Gobbins cliff path. We will continue to target people of Ulster-Scots descent; and to promote Northern Ireland as a top golf destination.’ Sean Bean is one of a number of stars to appear in HBO series Game of Thrones, based on the bestselling novels Song of Ice and Fire by author George RR Martin .

"Let's face it, as far as fans are concerned, what else do Arsenal, Liverpool and Manchester United have to play for? The best of the rest? A third and fourth place spot, which one of them, if not two, dare say it all three, could still miss out on? Admittedly, Arsenal are still in the Champions League, but Arsene Wenger has made it through the group stage, ticked another box on his managerial targets for the year and could well exit the competition at the same stage they have in the previous four campaigns. Arsene Wenger lifts the FA Cup trophy aloft after Arsenal beat Hull at Wembley last May . Aaron Ramsey celebrates scoring the winner for the Gunners against Steve Bruce's side . Arsenal realise that retaining the FA Cup is their best chance of silverware this season . Steven Gerrard's 35th birthday happens to fall on FA Cup final day at the end of this season . The Champions League is like a speck in the distance for Arsenal, but lifting that FA Cup trophy in front of 90,000 fans at Wembley is within touching distance of all three. Yes, the Money Men, the owners and chief executives and chairmen want Champions League football to balance the books and keep the Financial Fair Play demons at bay. But real fans want trophies and with Chelsea and Manchester City being dumped out of the tournament in true magic-of-the-cup fashion by Bradford and Middlesbrough, the FA Cup is there for the taking. It's at the tip of their fingers. Within their grasp. When Liverpool travel to Crystal Palace on Saturday, Arsenal host Middlesbrough on Sunday and Manchester United visit Preston on Monday, that will not be lost on their respective managers. Filipe Morais celebrates after scoring as League One Bradford City dumped Chelsea out at Stamford Bridge . Manchester United haven't won the trophy for more than 10 years (Wayne Rooney has never clinched it) The final, the showpiece event at the national stadium at the end of the league season on May 30, falls, as no Liverpool fan will let us forget, on Steven Gerrard's 35th birthday. Manager Brendan Rodgers sees it as the perfect send-off for club and country's greatest player of the past decade (surely winning the league, the only club trophy to have eluded him, would be better?). Wenger revealed after Arsenal's FA Cup final win against Hull last season that it was the sweetest trophy of his career, coming from two goals behind in the first eight minutes to win in extra time and shrug the mounting trophy drought from his heavily weighed-down shoulders. United haven't lifted it for more than a decade, their last victory coming in 2004, allowing Arsenal to catch them as joint-most winners sharing 11. Louis van Gaal has described the FA Cup as 'the most famous domestic cup in the world' Wayne Rooney, Michael Carrick and Jonny Evans have never won it. This season, Louis Van Gaal made it a priority, alongside the Premier League title, and having managed in Spain, Holland and Germany described it as 'the most famous domestic cup in the world'. Top-flight teams have taken the competition, it feels, more seriously from the early stages this season. When this trio entered at the third round, they all played strong sides. Rodgers started Gerrard and Philippe Coutinho against League Two AFC Wimbledon. Radamel Falcao, Rooney and Anders Herrera were all in from the off against League One Yeovil. In Arsenal's repeat of last year's final against Hull they went with Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Theo Walcott. Can one of them get a grip on the trophy now and wrench it from their rivals' claws?","Arsenal, Manchester United and Liverpool the top clubs still left in .

"The maker of Edward Snowden documentary CITIZENFOUR refused to travel to the film’s UK premiere last night because she fears arrest under the Official Secrets Act. Laura Poitras said she had been advised by lawyers to avoid travelling to Britain because her work with the fugitive former contractor with the National Security Agency. Snowden is living in Moscow with his girlfriend Lindsay Mills after he was granted asylum by Russia to escape charges of espionage in the U.S. Laura Poitras (left), the director of new film CITIZENFOUR about Edward Snowden (right) avoided the London premiere of the movie today because she feared arrest under the official secrets act . Poitras spoke from Berlin via patchy Skype videolink to the packed first public showing in Britain of CITIZENFOUR at the Curzon cinema in Chelsea, west London. Skype is owned by Microsoft, one of the very Internet companies accused of allowing the NSA ‘backdoor’ access to its customers communications and data. ‘It’s because of the laws of the UK, the UK Terrorism Act and the Official Secrets (Act), that make publishing this kind of work very dangerous for journalists,’ she said. ‘I’ve just been advised by my lawyer don’t go to the UK and that’s why I’m not there.’ Poitras said reporter Glenn Greenwald, who published the first stories from Snowden’s leaks, information security journalist Jacob Applebaum, and Sarah Harrison and Julian Assange from WikiLeaks had all also stayed away on the basis of legal advice. Assange is in Britain but technically not in UK territory since he is holed up at the Ecuadorean embassy to avoid extradition to Sweden to face questioning over alleged sex crimes. Poitras is a U.S. citizen, but is now living in Berlin after complaining of repeated stops by U.S. border authorities when travelling into her country. MailOnline contacted the Home Office for comment on her claims she feared arrest if travelling to the UK, but none was available at the time of reporting. American journalist Glenn Greenwald (left) was also told to avoid the showing by his lawyers . CITIZENFOUR takes its title from the email alias that Snowden used when he first approached Poitras in early 2013 through a series of encrypted emails - with a view to leaking details of the NSA’s top-secret surveillance assets to the media. Marketed as a 'real-life thriller,' it is the first of several films in the works about Snowden, who is wanted by the U.S. on charges brought under the Espionage Act. Speaking to the UK premiere last night, Poitras claimed the 30-year-old computer systems analyst had no interest in becoming a celebrity. ‘He said “I don’t want to be the story.” And I said, “You know what? Even if you don’t want to be, you will be the story because the Press works like that.”’ Snowden's revelations sparked a global debate on the limits of privacy versus the needs of national security. His critics view him as a traitor who refuses to face trial in the U.S. for his actions, while supports see him as a hero who spoke up for civil liberties. A top spy last week revealed how Snowden's leaked documents have made the job of monitoring terrorists far more difficult. Sir Iain Lobban, the outgoing head of the British government's NSA equivalent, GCHQ, revealed that since the revelations it now takes three times as long to complete routine monitoring tasks.","Laura Poitras advised by lawyers to avoid UK premiere of her new film .

His former team-mate Keane will be in the opposition dugout, with the Irishman having taken up a role as Paul Lambert's assistant during the summer. But former England centre back Ferdinand believes the manner of Keane's exit from United in 2005 was 'sad' Keane is renowned for his straight-talking, no-nonsense approach to coaching and Ferdinand believes that will be rubbing off on the Villa dressing room. 'He always expects the very highest standards and I'm sure he will be making his presence felt in the Villa dressing room,' he continued. Having fallen out with former United boss Sir Alex Ferguson and his assistant Carlos Queiroz over an interview he did with MUTV, Keane left United under a cloud in 2005. The controversy which surrounded Keane's exit saddens Ferdinand. The 35-year-old added: 'I still think it was sad the way he left Old Trafford - but he was a tremendous influence on me while he was there.'

"Chris Demaine was celebrating his dad's 60th birthday aboard a houseboat on Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe when the attack occurred . An exotic family holiday soon turned into a tragic death scene when a young man was viciously mauled by a pack of lions. Chris Demaine, from Perth in Western Australia, was celebrating his dad's 60th birthday aboard a houseboat on Lake Kariba in Zimbabwe last month when the boat's deckhand was attacked. Mr Demaine, a 25-year-old paramedic student, told The West Australian that he was visiting the area where his father grew up alongside both his parents and a number of family friends. He described the scenery as 'amazing', saying there was 'wildlife everywhere'. But on only their first night at the lake, as the Demaine family's deckhand attempted to moor the boat to a tree, three hiding lionesses pounced on him. Horrified, the houseboat passengers stood helplessly as the man was mauled to death in front of them, according to The West Australian. Their only choice was to wait and watch the lions and the screaming deckhand until park rangers arrived at the scene, scaring them away with gunshots. Mr Demaine, a former soldier who spent time in both Afghanistan and East Timor, turned out to be the only one in his company with medical experience.

Mr Demaine described the scenery at Lake Kariba as 'amazing' with 'wildlife everywhere' After quickly assessing the deckhand, who had died of his serious injuries, Mr Demaine and the boat passengers were forced to bring the body on board and wait until the morning for police to arrive.

"There have been times in Jose Mourinho’s career when he has shown what a sentimental old fool he can be. He is a romantic at heart. This was the official homecoming for Didier Drogba, the first time Chelsea’s supporters have seen him in their Champions League jersey since that incredible night in the Allianz Arena. After starting this game, he was blowing heavily for most of it in his struggle to recapture past glories. At 36, it is too much to ask. Chelsea striker Didier Drogba jumps over Schalke goalkeeper Ralf Fahrmann . Two years ago, when Chelsea went on to win the Champions League, Drogba was the main man. He was king in these parts, then. That night, he summoned superhuman powers to score their equaliser against Bayern Munich in the 88th minute and went on to strike the winning penalty in the shootout. On Wednesday night, as Chelsea fans heartily sang Diego Costa’s name after he was brought on with Loic Remy in an attempt to snatch victory, it felt like the endgame for Drogba. Drogba joins in the celebrations for Cesc Fabregas' opening goal against Schalke . Stamford Bridge had been willing him to score, but those legs could not carry him to the places his razor-sharp mind wanted to go. There were chances in each half as he attempted to add to the 34 Chelsea goals he has scored in this competition. The first was nicked off his toes for a corner. After the break, Eden Hazard, Chelsea’s outstanding player in an ordinary performance, set him clear of Schalke’s defence. He beat keeper Ralf Fahrmann, but rolled his effort wide. Then there was the ‘Gazza moment’, sliding in like the England midfielder at Euro 96, when Willian crossed from the right. He, like Gascoigne, failed to connect. ‘I was happy with Drogba’s performance,’ insisted Mourinho. ‘One inch is nothing, that is all. He could have scored.’ Drogs backs Chelsea captain John Terry as he protests against his booking for kicking the ball away . To judge Drogba on one start would be ridiculous, but the fact Mourinho reached for Costa and Remy 17 minutes from time said it all. Chelsea’s manager always looks out for his favourites. When Inter Milan were 2-0 up with four minutes to play in the 2010 Champions League final, Mourinho sent on Marco Materazzi as a substitute. It was the Italian’s reward for his loyalty during Mourinho’s final season at San Siro. This was another emotional decision by Mourinho ahead of Sunday’s game at Manchester City. Costa’s place for that is nailed on. Drogba makes way for Diego Costa during Wednesday's 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge . Drogba was on his own up front, ahead of the playground footballers — Hazard, Willian and Cesc Fabregas — who provide the attacking thrust. They have younger legs and danced around Schalke in a dizzy opening spell. There were flashes from Drogba, the silky touches that once turned this guy into one of the dangerous strikers in Europe. The neat header to Fabregas, from a long ball by John Terry, was the Drogba of old. So was the backchat with Hazard, after he took the ball off his toes when he should have peeled off him. When he was replaced by Costa, the chants were for the new man in town. Undeniably, they have replaced an old favourite here.","Didier Droga made first appearance in Champions League jersey for Chelsea since 2012 triumph .

"Two months after their son's death at the hands of Islamic State jihadists, the parents of James Foley paid a tearful tribute to the journalist today during a ceremony in northwestern France. Diane and John Foley arrived at the memorial for fallen war reporters in Bayeux to honor those who have died in war zones in 2014. During an emotional speech they urged the public not to forget that 'information is vital' and said they hoped James, who was murdered in August, 'did not die in vain'. Tearful: Diane and John Foley, the parents of US journalist James Foley, stand in the war reporters' memorial after a stone commemorating the reporters who died in 2014 was unveiled . Tribute: Mr Foley reaches out and touches the stone as his wife stands alongside Maryvonne Lepage, mother of French photoreporter Camille Lepage who was killed in the Central African Republic in May . Remembrance: Mrs Foley holds her hand up to her face and her husband looks away as the members of the audience read the names of 51 journalists who have been killed so far in 2014 . The couple unveiled a stone honoring the fallen reporters alongside Maryvonne Lepage, the mother of Camille Lepage, 28 a freelance photographer who was murdered in the Central African Republic in May. The Bayeux-Calvados journalism awards were created in 1994 in honour of the 50th anniversary of the Allied landing. Christophe Deloire , Secretary General of Reporters without Borders, said: 'Obviously, this year 2014 will be remembered for the ignominious character beheadings of journalists... with up to abyss and threats following the hostage, it is the height of ignominy. 'The number of journalists killed in 2014 is already extremely high - 51 - after 71 throughout the year 2013 and a sad record in 2012 (88).' Foley, who died on August 19 aged 40, began his career teaching basic reading and writing skills to inmates of a Chicago prison. He switched to journalism in 2007 and admitted he was 'pretty much hooked' when a Washington Post reporter told him it was possible for a freelance to cover war zones. After journalism school, he set off to report in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria. Foley was kidnapped in 2012 while covering the Syrian uprising. The Islamic State group posted a Web video showing his killing. In the letter, Foley says he held with 17 other hostages, and they passed the time by discussing movies, sports and trivia and playing games made up of scraps found in their jail cell. Victim: James Foley was beheaded by Islamic State militants in August at the age of 40. He had spent years as a freelance reporter covering conflicts in the Middle East and was captured in Syria in 2012 . During an interview in September, Diane Foley told CNN that 'as an American', she was 'embarrassed and appalled' at efforts to rescue her son from captivity. Articulate and thoughtful throughout her interview, Mrs Foley said her son 'was sacrificed because of a lack of communication and prioritization.' 'Jim was killed in the most horrific way. He was sacrificed because of just a lack of coordination, lack of communication, lack of prioritization,' said Diane Foley. 'As a family, we had to find our way through this on our own.' Arrival: Diane Foley holds the arm of her husband John as they arrive at the memorial during the annual Bayeux-Calvados war journalism awards week . Tribute: The couple deliver a speech translated by Radio France reporter Claude Guibal (right) in the war reporters' memorial before the unveiling of the stone. They said they hoped their son didn't die in vain . Another American journalist Steven Sotloff and two British aid workers, David Haines and Alan Henning, have since been executed  by the militant group in Syria. 'At AFP we cover conflicts for decades, but we did not feel as vulnerable as in parts of Syria, where it has become too dangerous to even consider the practice of true journalism ,' said Philip Chetwynd, editor-in- Chief of the AFP central . He added: 'James Foley was for many of us to AFP a friend,' he has added a tribute to the quality of work of each of the six other journalists.'","Diane and John Foley took part in the ceremony in Bayeux .

"Swingeing green stealth levies on energy bills are ‘perverse’ and should be scrapped, MPs warn today. A major report says the taxes are hitting poorer families hardest. MPs also call for middle-class pensioners to lose their winter fuel allowance, with the savings redirected to help low-income households insulate their homes. And they attack the regulator Ofgem for failing to hold energy firms to account for soaring prices. Ministers have been accused of using stealth taxes to fund the huge subsidies given to green energy firms . The findings come in a report by the Commons energy and climate change committee, which warns that, based on Government estimates, green levies will add a third to electricity prices by 2020 – even before expected rises in wholesale prices are factored in. Ministers have been accused of using stealth taxes to fund the huge subsidies given to green energy firms – needed to meet controversial carbon reduction targets set by the last government. MPs warned that most families have no idea what the green energy drive is costing them, adding: ‘There is no widespread understanding by consumers of how much of their bills is made up of levies.’ The average family pays £1,267 towards energy bills, with £112 comprising green taxes – £18 of which is directly spent on subsidising wind farms. By 2020 the contribution will have increased by more than 150 per cent, with each household required to pay £286 as part of their bills, according to the Department for Energy and Climate Change. The committee’s report says: . ‘Increasing use of levies on bills to fund energy and climate policies . is problematic since it is likely to hit hardest those least able to . pay.’ MPs suggested that if . the green subsidies were to continue they should be funded through the . tax system, which is more transparent and ‘less regressive than the . levies’. The . report questions the repeated claim by ministers that families will see . lower bills as a result of Government policies, which include measures . to promote energy efficiency. It calls on ministers to start an ‘honest conversation about the fact that energy bills are highly likely to continue to rise’. The report questions the repeated claim by ministers that families will see lower bills as a result of Government policies, which include measures to promote energy efficiency . Since 2007, average prices of gas and . electricity have increased by  41 per cent – 20 per cent in real terms – . leaving millions of households in ‘fuel poverty’. MPs warned that the . public’s ‘deep mistrust’ of energy providers will continue unless they . show greater transparency and reassure households that high prices are . not fuelling excessive profits. Dr . John Constable, director of the Renewable Energy Foundation, said: . ‘There is little or nothing to be said in favour of energy bill levies. ‘They . hurt the poor most, they reduce competition in the energy markets and . make supplier switching less effective – and by camouflaging government . taxation they reduce democratic accountability. If the levies were . cancelled tomorrow, no one would shed a tear.’ The report re-opens the debate over . whether better-off pensioners should continue to receive the winter fuel . allowance, which is worth up to £300 a year. David Cameron has ruled out any change to the system before the election in 2015. But the cross-party committee urged . ministers to introduce ‘better targeting of the winter fuel allowance . through means testing’ and to consider ‘how savings could be used to . boost investment in energy-efficiency programmes’. Since 2007, average prices of gas and electricity have increased by  41 per cent ¿ 20 per cent in real terms . MPs also said they were ‘disappointed at Ofgem’s slow progress’ in forcing the energy giants to reveal how much they were making from household bills. The regulator must ‘use its teeth’ and force energy firms to explain the reasons behind price rises, the report says. But Sarah Harrison, of Ofgem, said the watchdog welcomed the report and rejected any suggestion that it was 'falling down on the job'. 'We agree with the committee that the energy companies have been poor in communicating with and accounting to customers but that’s why we’ve been leading the way on transparency,' she told BBC Breakfast. 'We require the energy companies to report where their costs are and where they are taking their profit across different parts of their business.' She added: 'We are here not to be nice to anybody in particular or indeed tough to anybody in particular. 'We are here with one goal in mind, which is to protect customers, and we will use the full range of powers we have got to do that. 'That includes taking penalty action against companies who fail their customers - and they do.' Providers also were criticised in the report for ‘falling far short of what is required to increase transparency and improve consumer trust’. MP John Robertson, who sits on the energy and climate change select committee, said there is a lack of competitive pricing between the big energy companies. Speaking on Radio 4's Today programme, he said: 'The fact of the matter is we have six large companies that charge roughly the same and have the same increases but they are meant to be in competition with each other. 'If you think six companies will all work in the same way with the same rises and profits, I don't think that's right. 'Supermarkets try and undercut each other to prove they are the best but it seems to be about how much they [the energy companies] can make and to make it as high as possible.' Energy Secretary Ed Davey rejected the suggestion that ministers were misleading the public over the impact of green energy measures on bills. He said: ‘Our policies to support renewable energy and reduce energy waste are insulating consumers from the rising cost of  fossil fuels. And by 2020, our analysis shows household energy bills will on average be £166 lower than they would be if we did nothing.’ The trade association for the energy industry said profits were necessary for employment and investment in new power stations. Angela Knight, chief executive of Energy UK, said: ‘We have seen radical change – there are fewer tariffs and the new deals are clearer so it is easier to compare, bills have been simplified so they are easier for customers to follow and it is simple to switch from one supplier to another.’","MPs call price hikes to fund green energy 'perverse'

"It's back. The greatest prize in club football, the European Champions League, returns for another glorious season on Tuesday and as ever there's so much to look forward to. The biggest teams and the biggest stars going head-to-head in the biggest stadiums for the biggest prize on the continent. There really is nothing better. Here's 10 reasons why we can't wait for the return of Europe's top competition this week. Who will succeed Real Madrid as champions of Europe this season? 1. The return of Liverpool . It's been a long five years away for Liverpool and their captain Steven Gerrard admitted to feeling 'jealousy' as rivals Man United, Man City and Chelsea took on the cream of Europe. But the wait is finally over and the strains of the iconic Champions League anthem will once again ring out at Anfield ahead of their match with Ludogorets Razgard on Tuesday. For a club with such a proud European pedigree as Liverpool, being away from the Champions League really hurt and they'll be desperate to make up for lost time. Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard limbers up as he prepares to lead Liverpool back into the Champions League . Steven Gerrard lifts the European Cup after Liverpool's memorable comeback win in Istanbul in 2005 . Mario Balotelli is set to lead the Liverpool line against Ludogorets on Tuesday night . Brendan Rodgers has a bold and exciting team to unleash, with Mario Balotelli leading the line ahead of the likes of Adam Lallana, Raheem Sterling, Philippe Coutinho and Lazar Markovic (when he returns from suspension). There are few things more stirring in football than a big European night at Anfield and they will be worth the wait. 2. Arsenal's British core take on Europe . While Liverpool are making a return, Arsenal are mainstays in the Champions League, about to embark on their 17th consecutive season. They begin with a tricky trip to Borussia Dortmund and won't be helped by a defensive injury crsis that sees them without Mathieu Debuchy, Nacho Monreal and possibly Calum Chambers. Arsene Wenger is preparing to lead Arsenal in the Champions League for the 17th successive season . Arsenal will be without right-back Mathieu Debuchy for their trip to Borussia Dortmund on Tuesday . (Left to right) Danny Welbeck, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain, Calum Chambers and Jack Wilshere form part of Arsenal's English core as they chase glory in the Champions League . But they do boast a wonderfully creative attack, with the likes of Aaron Ramsey, Danny Welbeck, Jack Wilshere and Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain flying the flag for British talent. Throw in Alexis Sanchez, Santi Cazorla and Mesut Ozil and the Gunners should have the firepower to cause plenty of problems. They take on Dortmund, Galatasaray and Anderlecht in their group. 3. Chelsea aiming to go one better . It was a case of so near and yet so far for Chelsea as they were beaten by Atletico Madrid in last season's semi-finals. The lack of a deadly goalscorer proved the downfall of Jose Mourinho's team, but this time it's all very different. Diego Costa helped Atletico Madrid to victory over Chelsea in last season's Champions League semi-finals . But now Costa is showing excellent form for Chelsea following his £32m summer move . Diego Costa has scored seven goals in four Premier League matches since his £32m move from Atletico and if he can translate that form into European competition, there's no reason why Chelsea can't repeat their 2012 triumph. Chelsea start their campaign at home to Schalke on Wednesday and a group that also contains Maribor and Sporting Lisbon shouldn't cause too many problems. 4. Champions City with a point to prove . They may have won two Premier League titles out of three but Manchester City haven't yet been able to translate domestic dominance into European success. When they are confronted with one of the established names, they have struggled. Last season, it was Barcelona. The year before it was Real Madrid and Borussia Dortmund. The year before that Bayern Munich. Lionel Messi and Barcelona proved the downfall of Manchester City in last season's last 16 tie . City need star striker Sergio Aguero to deliver the goals if they are to improve in the Champions League . And as a result, they once again find themselves in a tough group with Bayern, Roma and CSKA Moscow, travelling to the Allianz Arena first up on Wednesday. It's time for City to perform and get to the latter stages and they undoubtedly have the quality to get there. 5. Real's Galacticos - Part II . They ended an agonising 12-year wait for a Champions League crown last season and now Real Madrid are hungry for more. Having secured the much-coveted Decima triumph on an unforgettable night in Lisbon back in May, Real start their pursuit of No 11 at home to Basle on Tuesday night. Cristiano Ronaldo celebrates scoring Real Madrid's fourth goal in the 4-1 final win over Atletico Madrid in May . New Galactico James Rodriguez celebrates with Cristiano Ronaldo during the Madrid derby with Atletico . They look an even more formidable proposition this time round, with James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos the latest Galacticos to join Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema. It's actually been quote a shaky start to the season for Carlo Ancelotti's men, with league defeats already to Real Sociedad and Atletico Madrid. They will hope the Champions League will provide the kick-start they need. 6. Barcelona's awesome forward line . Barcelona also have the Champions League firmly in their sights having strengthened their attacking options with the purchase of Luis Suarez. As we all know, Suarez won't be available until the matchday four trip to Ajax but his goalscoring talents could prove the difference between success and failure in the latter stages. Barcelona's new star signing Luis Suarez will be available from matchday four onwards . Neymar and Lionel Messi celebrate a goal in Barcelona's win over Athletic Bilbao at the weekend . However with their midfield packed with plenty of Champions League nous and Lionel Messi and Neymar up front, Barca have plenty to go on. They start their quest for a first Champions League title since 2011 when they play APOEL Nicosia on Wednesday, with two tantalising games with Paris Saint-Germain to come. 7. Bayern's stars on top of the world . Having been embarrassed by Real Madrid in last season's semi-finals, Bayern Munich find themselves with something to prove on the European stage. But at least their German stars have that winning feeling - Manuel Neuer, Jerome Boateng, Philipp Lahm, Mario Gotze, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Thomas Muller helped win the World Cup over the summer. Bayern Munich's Philipp Lahm lifts the World Cup for Germany during the summer . Thomas Muller will once again offer a potent goalscoring threat for Bayern Munich in the Champions League . Pep Guardiola is seeking to win his third European Cup as a coach . With genuine challenges likely to be few and far between in their domestic league, Bayern will set their sights on European glory and they have an amazing team. Pep Guardiola already has two Champions League wins as a manager - he'd dearly like to make it three. 8. Familiar faces . The Champions League is a constellation of stars and many of them we know very well from the Premier League. Former Chelsea and Tottenham manager Andre Villas-Boas will be leading Zenit St Petersburg into action against Benfica, Monaco and Bayer Leverkusen in Group C. Dimitar Berbatov will spearhead the Monaco attack on their return to the Champions League for the first time since 2005-2006. And Man City will come up against a familiar foe in Ashley Cole when they take on Roma. Andre Villas-Boas is in charge of Zenit St Petersburg for this season's Champions League campaign . Dimitar Berbatov will be up front for Monaco as they make their return to the Champions League . Ashley Cole will line up for Roma, who have been paired in the same group as Manchester City . 9. The minnows . The elite invariably grab the headlines in the Champions League but let's not forget some of the lesser lights taking part. Nobody could have scripted Ludogorets' qualification play-off victory over Steaua Bucharest as defender Cosmin Moti donned the goalkeeper's gloves to make two vital saves in a penalty shoot-out and secure their progress. Cypriots APOEL Nicosia will visit Barcelona, PSG and Ajax as they compete in the Champions League group phase for only the second time, while Maribor of Slovenia are also making their second appearance at this stage. Cosmin Moti was the penalty-saving hero for Ludogorets in their play-off win over Steaua Bucharest . 10. It is the best of football . Whoever's playing, the Champions League is a byword for top quality football and unmissable drama. The competition throws the world's biggest clubs and world class stars week-in week-out and it's wonderful to have it back again.","The Champions League returns this week as group stage gets underway .

"Nato would not be able to stop a Russian invasion of Eastern Europe because of years of military cuts, one of Britain’s top generals has warned. General Sir Richard Shirreff, who stepped down from his post as Nato deputy supreme commander earlier this year, said the military alliance needed to rearm if it was serious about defending itself in the future. Asked about the crisis in Ukraine, he said: ‘The reality is that Nato would be very hard pressed and they would find it very difficult to put into the field, at sea or into the air the means required, particularly on land I would assess, to counter any form of Russian adventurism.’ Scroll down for video... General Sir Richard Shirreff (left) and the Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen (right) have called for the military alliance's armed forces to be modernised . His remarks came after the Nato secretary general Anders Fogh Rasmussen revealed that the organisation will deploy forces at new bases in eastern Europe for the first time, in response to the crisis in Ukraine. The move is an attempt to deter Russian President Vladimir Putin from causing trouble in the former Soviet Baltic republics, according to Mr Rasmussen. He said the organisations's summit in Wales next week would overcome divisions within the alliance and agree to new deployments on Russia's borders – a move certain to trigger a strong reaction from Moscow. He also outlined moves to boost Ukraine's security, ‘modernise’ its armed forces and help the country counter the threat from Russia. During the Cold War the Soviet Union had a buffer zone of 'Warsaw Pact' allies, separating its border from the capitalist world . Russia has become increasingly concerned over the growing strength of Nato, which has spread east . His former colleague General Shireff, speaking on BBC Newsnight last night, said Nato needed urgent investment. He said: ‘Certainly western Europe would not be able to defend in my view against Russia without significant support from the Americans. ‘Nato would find it really difficult to get a division (20,000 people) out of the door in quick time. ‘Because certainly in western Europe what we have seen progressively is a dismantling of military capability.’ David Cameron will host next week's Nato summit in Wales amid warnings over Russian aggression in Eastern Europe . He accepted that advocating rearmament would be unpopular, but added: ‘It is a message our political leadership need to take home and listen to and act on if they are serious about ensuring that Nato has the means to defend itself in the future. ‘If Nato is serious about this, it is going to have to rearm, it is going to have to rebuild capability. European nations are going to have to put their hands in their pockets to spend more money on defence.’ Currently just four out of the 28 members spend more than the minimum target of two per cent of GDP on defence. Asked about the situation in Iraq, Sir Richard stressed the threat posed by IS, formerly known as ISIS or ISIL, had to be eradicated. He told the programme: ‘The first priority is to protect but ultimately the priority must be to eradicate IS as an external threat because of the potential impact on the Middle East ... but also its potential impact if its incubus is allowed to survive ... on our external security. There is (also) a very clear issue as far as internal security is concerned.’ When questioned about whether this meant siding with President Bashar Assad in Syria, he replied: ‘There can be no eradication of IS as a threat without a regional approach. ‘IS is operating and has spread into Syria and therefore there is likely to be or inevitably going to be a need to sit down and talk to difficult bed fellows, bad people. ‘It is one thing to say that we are going to deal with it, but you have to back up your words with actions and therefore in my view we should rule out nothing. ‘We must apply all the levers of power, political, diplomatic, economic and of course of military, but above all we need to establish the international political will to deal with this.’","General Sir Richard Shirreff said Nato needed to rearm to counter Russia .

"While violence rages on the streets of Venezuela, the children of former president Hugo Chavez have refused to move out of the presidential palace and turned it into a party pad. Rosa Virginia, 35, and Maria Gabriela Chavez, 33, are reportedly holding raucous nights in the luxurious six-bedroom villa, complete with a swimming pool and private movie theater. Current president Nicolas Maduro has a constitutional right to live there, but this problem may be low down his list of priorities, as civil unrest engulfs the country killing five people so far. Scroll down for video . Holding on: The daughters of former Venezuelan president Hugo Chavez are reportedly refusing to leave the luxurious presidential palace, and are holding 'deafening' parties there . Family: Maria Rosa (left) and Rosa Virginia (right) Chavez, daughters of the ex-president who died in March 2013, are refusing to leave the palace they have lived in for over a decade . The Sunday Times reported that palace neighbors have complained of 'deafening' parties held at the compound, which is full of valuable art and antiques. Fast food restaurants and other companies will apparently no longer deliver to the compound over unpaid bills. The paper also stated that concert organizers are sick of giving free tickets to Chavez's children . Last November, the BBC reported the Chavez daughters had refused to leave the property that they have lived in for over a decade. Tragic: Meanwhile, unrest continues  across Venezuela. Beauty queen Genesis Carmona was rushed to hospital by motorcycle after being shot in the head during an anti-government protest in Valencia on Wednesday. The 22-year-old university student died from her injuries . Victim: Carmona, who was Miss Tourism 2013 for Carabobo state, was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman who opened fire at anti-government protesters . Rosa Virginia and Maria Gabriela have reportedly had 'several altercations' with President Maduro and his wife over the issue. Meanwhile, riots continue on the streets of the country. Paratroopers are heading to a Venezuelan border area torn by fierce clashes between police and anti-government protesters. And . security forces are being accused of turning many parts of the country . into free-fire zones in their bid to silence a rejuvenated movement . challenging socialist rule. President . Nicolas Maduro's opponents charged Thursday that he has unleashed the . military, police and civilian militias against those who blame the . administration for hardships in a country that is rich in oil but . struggling with overheated inflation and one of the world's worst . homicide rates. Violence has . escalated across Venezuela since a Feb. 12 opposition rally that was . followed by clashes between young activists and the National Guard in . which three people died. At least three more deaths and dozens of injuries have occurred in protest violence since then. Leopoldo .

Embattled: It is current President Nicolas Maduro's right to live in teh palace but he has bigger problems at the moment, such as the protests sweeping the country. Five people have died in clashes with authorities so far . Violence: A student participates in a protest in Altamira this week. On Thursday President Maduro threatened to expel television network CNN from the country if it did not 'rectify' the way it has covered deadly political protests . Tensions could be high Friday in the city of Valencia, where a funeral was scheduled for a local beauty queen who was killed by a bullet this week while participating in a protest. The death of Genesis Carmona, a 22-year-old university student who had been Miss Tourism 2013 for Carabobo state, reverberated in this country that prizes beauty queens. Carmona was shot in the head by an unidentified gunman who opened fire at anti-government protesters. Miss Carmona, a marketing student and beauty queen, slumped to the ground. A bystander scooped her up in his arms and put her on his motorbike. But despite rushing her to hospital for emergency surgery, doctors were unable to save her life. On Wednesday night Miss Carmona’s family were in shock. ‘How long are we going to live like this? How long do we have to tolerate this pressure, with them killing us?’ a relative said. ‘She only needed one more semester to graduate,’ he added. On Thursday President Maduro threatened to expel television network CNN from the country if it did not 'rectify' the way it has covered deadly political protests. At least five people have been killed in the unrest that the government blames on opposition-led 'fascists' and that its rivals blame on the security forces. Unrest: A demonstrator holds an iron chain in front of the riot police during a newsprint shortage protest in Caracas. Some 600 people took to the streets of the Venezuelan capital on February 11 to protest a newsprint shortage that has caused the temporary closure of dozens of newspapers . Local television networks have provided almost no live coverage of the protests against Maduro, which began last month over a wide range of complaints including inflation, violent crime, corruption and shortages of basic products. As a result, many opposition supporters have turned to CNN Espanol, available to some cable TV subscribers, which in recent days has been the only television to offer live broadcasts of opposition press conferences. 'I've asked the (information) minister to tell CNN we have started the administrative process to remove them from Venezuela if they don't rectify (their behavior),' Maduro said on state TV. 'Enough! I won't accept war propaganda against Venezuela.' 'We do not have an official comment at this time on President Maduro's most recent comments about CNN,' Bridget Leininger, a CNN spokeswoman, said in an email to Reuters.","Former Venezuela president Hugo Chavez died in March 2013 .

"Andy Murray has that winning feeling again after engineering a spectacular turnaround in the Shenzhen Open final to end his title drought. The Scot faced five match points in a second-set tie-break, four of them in succession from 6-2 behind, but saved them with some of his best tennis on his way to a 5-7 7-6 (11/9) 6-1 victory over Tommy Robredo, his first tournament triumph since Wimbledon last year. Murray will be relieved and no doubt proud to have secured his first silverware since parting ways with Ivan Lendl before the French Open and pairing up with French coach Amelie Mauresmo in June. Theirs has been a combination which has come under a close scrutiny which should be eased by this achievement. Andy Murray raises his trophy after winning the men's singles final match against Tommy Robredo . Murray was all smiles after winning the Shenzhen Open on day seven of the event held in China . British tennis star Murray competed in his first final since winning Wimbledon in 2013 . Spaniard Robredo could barely walk to the net come the end of a gruelling contest played in intense heat in southern China, with Murray's remarkably high levels of fitness being richly rewarded. Murray had capped a glorious 12 months with his Wimbledon triumph in July 2013, which came in the wake of Olympic gold and the US Open title, but back surgery later in the year ended his season early. He returned to the tour at the start of this year, struggling to come close to the form that enabled him to end Britain's 77-year wait for a men's singles champion at the All England Club. A semi-final run at the French Open hinted at the 27-year-old running into peak form in time for Wimbledon, but a quarter-final thrashing by Grigor Dimitrov told otherwise. Sunday's Shenzhen title match was Murray's first final of an uncharacteristically fallow year to date, and it looked like being anticlimactic for his followers when Robredo moved to the brink of victory. Yet the result told a wholly different story, the manner of his victory offering fresh reassurance that Murray is lacking nothing in determination to get back to the top of the sport. Murray had entered the modest ATP 250 tier event because of his impatience to experience the thrill of winning a tournament, and to strengthen his prospects of qualifying for the end-of-year Tour Finals in London. Next week he will be in Beijing, for the China Open, before competing in Masters 1000 events in Shanghai and Paris in October, where big points and big money come into play. After he and Robredo pair traded early breaks in the opening set, Murray staved off another in the ninth game with a potent forehand. Spain's Robredo decided to wear sunglasses during the final of the Shenzhen Open . The 27-year-old came back from a set down to beat Spain's Tommy Robredo . Murray reached the final by beating Juan Monaco of Argentina in the semi finals . But there was no escape from love-40 in Murray's next service game, at 5-5. Murray saved the first break point but Robredo then thrashed back a weak serve and all the Scot could do was paddle it into the sidelines. Soon the set was gone. Murray broke for a 4-2 lead in the second set but was pegged back immediately by the world number 22. With Robredo serving at 5-4 behind, Murray earned two set points but could take neither. That looked to be his big chance, especially once Robredo surged ahead in the tie-break. Murray found some sparkling form when the match points arrived for his opponent, but then gifted Robredo a fifth chance by netting a forehand. Murray clenched his fist as he saved that too, and a backhand behind the Spaniard gave the 27-year-old his first set point of the tie-break. Robredo staved that off though, and another set point, before Murray gunned down a brilliant forehand that brought up a third, one which he took. The herculean effort was backed up by Murray as he broke serve at the start of the third set, and from then on, with Robredo suffering, the outcome was never in doubt.

"With its 200 acres complete with lakes, formal gardens and a riding school, Rydinghurst is a world away from the cramped terraces of working class Liverpool where Ringo Starr grew up. But the estate, near Cranleigh, Surrey, which The Beatles drummer bought in 1999 for £2million, will go up for sale this week and is expected to fetch as much as ten times that amount. The Grade-II listed Jacobean mansion offers a glimpse into the luxury lifestyle of Mr Starr, 74 - one quarter of the world’s most successful music group - who redesigned the estate after buying it with his wife, former Bond girl Barbara Bach, 67, from Count George Bardeau. Scroll down for video . On the market: The estate, near Cranleigh, Surrey, which The Beatles drummer Ringo Starr bought in 1999 for £2million, will go up for sale this week . Living room: The Grade-II listed Jacobean mansion offers a glimpse into the luxury lifestyle of Mr Starr, 74 - one quarter of the world's most successful music group . Nicky Haslam, the celebrity interior designer who helped the couple redesign the house, said: ‘We took it back practically to bare walls, and it was terrific fun to do. ‘I had to employ specialist plasterers, and Ringo loves all that kind of English craftsmanship. He was very hands on and can read plans, which few clients can do. ‘I was given pretty much free rein with the décor, but Ringo wanted a music room for his gold records and drum kits, and there’s another big music room, more like a ballroom, for performing. ‘There’s a wonderful kitchen, as they both like to cook and have specific food requirements. It had to be big enough to eat in, and there’s a pretty herb garden just outside.’ He added: ‘We did the pool house two years later. They didn’t leave anything undone – the garden is beautiful. Ringo certainly likes a plant or two, though I can’t say I actually ever saw him with a space in his hand, spreading manure.’ Swimming pool: Mr Starr and Miss Bach are selling 17th century Rydinghurst as they rarely find time to stay in the property . Time to say goodbye: The move ends a nearly five-decade association of Surrey with The Beatles, which began in 1965 . Mr Starr and Miss Bach are selling 17th century Rydinghurst – which boasts its own cinema, entrance lodge, cottage, coach house, indoor pool, gym, paddock, helipad and stables on top of the six bedrooms and six reception rooms – as they rarely find time to stay in the property, mainly living between their flat off the King’s Road in London and in America. 'We have spent 15 years at Rydinghurst and will always have wonderful memories of our time there' Ringo Starr and Barbara Bach . They told The Sunday Times: ‘We have spent 15 years at Rydinghurst and will always have wonderful memories of our time there. It is a beautiful home with some very special features, but we are, reluctantly, unable to spend as much time there as we would wish. ‘With commitments in American and our family all in England, we will continue to divide our time between Los Angeles and London.’ The draw of California is reportedly two-fold for the couple, who have five children between them, all from previous relationships. The first is work commitments.

'Ringo wanted a music room for his gold records and drum kits, and there’s another big music room, more like a ballroom, for performing' Nicky Haslam, celebrity interior designer . He said recently: ‘I’m really into the healthy lifestyle that they have out in LA. I do yoga every day and eat healthily. I’m obsessed with broccoli – I eat it with absolutely everything. It’s become a running joke. My wife makes fun of me for it. Broccoli is my secret to looking young.’ The move ends a nearly five-decade association of Surrey with The Beatles, which began in 1965 when their manager, Brian Epstein, decided they should all live close to each other and away from the prying eyes of the press. Although, Paul McCartney decided to stay in London, 30 miles away from Rydinghurst. Despite saying goodbye to the country, Mr Starr recently reaffirmed his love for the area, when he said: ‘When you've grown up around the dusty back streets of Liverpool, you don't ever expect to end up comfortable and settled in the leafy surrounds of Surrey, but it's a beautiful place'. Despite this, he has been preparing to sell the property since early this year and it will be put on the market by luxury estate agents Knight Frank.","Rydinghurst, near Cranleigh, Surrey, has 200 acres complete with lakes, formal gardens and riding school .

"Male smokers are three times more likely than non-smoking men to lose their Y chromosomes, a new study has found. The research may explain why men develop and die from many cancers at disproportionate rates compared to women. A recent study found an association between Y chromosome loss and a shorter life span, as well as a higher risk of multiple cancers. Scroll down for video . Since only men have Y chromosomes, the new finding offers a possible answer to why smoking is a greater risk factor for cancer among men than women. Besides lung cancer, which is caused by smoking and is often fatal, tobacco smoking is known to be a major risk factor for a range of serious illnesses. It is the world's leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure. Epidemiological data show male smokers have a higher risk of developing non-lung forms of cancer than women who smoke. In a study in the journal Science, researchers at Sweden's Uppsala University found that Y chromosomes, which are important for sex determination and sperm production, more often disappear from blood cells of smokers than those of men who have never smoked or of men who have kicked the habit. Since only men have Y chromosomes, the finding offers a possible answer to why smoking is a greater risk factor for cancer among men than women. Women have two X chromosomes; males have an X and a Y. 'There is a correlation between a common and avoidable risk factor, that is smoking, and the most common human mutation -- loss of the Y chromosome,' said Jan Dumanski, an Uppsala professor who worked on the study. 'This ... may in part explain why men in general have a shorter life span than women and why smoking is more dangerous for men. 'This discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit.' Besides lung cancer, which is caused by smoking and is often fatal, tobacco smoking is known to be a major risk factor for a range of serious illnesses. It is the world's leading preventable cause of premature death from chronic conditions such as heart disease, strokes and high blood pressure. Epidemiological data show male smokers have a higher risk of developing non-lung forms of cancer than women who smoke. The team analysed data on more than 6,000 men, taking into account their ages, exercise habits, cholesterol levels, education status, alcohol intake and many other health and behavioural factors. Besides lung cancer, which is caused by smoking and is often fatal, tobacco smoking is known to be a major risk factor for a range of serious illnesses. They discovered that in smokers, the loss of Y chromosomes appeared to be dose-dependent -- in other words, men who smoked more lost more -- and that some men who went on to quit smoking appeared to regain their Y chromosomes. Lars Forsberg, who also worked on the study, said this suggested Y chromosome loss due to smoking might be reversible . 'This discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit,' he said. The scientists are not sure how loss of Y chromosomes in blood cells is linked with the development of cancer, although one possibility is that immune cells in blood that have lost their Y chromosome have a reduced capacity to fight cancer cells. 'This discovery could be very persuasive for motivating smokers to quit,' Lars Forsberg, a researcher at Finland's Uppsala University who led the study, said in a statement. The Y chromosome is of course the stretch of DNA that makes a man. Women have two X chromosomes; males have an X and a Y. But the Y chromosome controls more than the production of male hormones. It may affect how the body fights cancer, the Finnish team said. And other studies have shown that men are more likely to get non-lung cancers from smoking than women are — from bladder cancer to colon cancer. It might be that smoking damages DNA in general and that the Y chromosome, which is one of the smallest chromosomes in the human genome and already mutation-prone, is just more vulnerable, the researchers say. More research is needed to get the answer.","Male smokers are three times more likely than non-smoking men to lose their Y chromosomes, the new Swedish study has found .

"After years of refusing to be drawn on whether he supports Scottish independence or not, Wimbledon champion and Olympic gold medallist Andy Murray appears to have finally taken a side. The 27-year-old, tweeted in the early hours of Thursday morning: 'Huge day for Scotland today! no campaign negativity last few days totally swayed my view on it. excited to see the outcome. lets do this!' With the bold statement to his 2.7million followers on the day voting starts, Murray appears to have dropped his carefully guarded neutrality when he's been asked his views on the referendum in the past. Gold: Murray represented Team GB at the London 2012 Olympics, winning a Gold and Silver medal. He now appears to be in favour of an independent Scotland . 'Yes' supporters in Twitter were delighted with the reigning Sports Personality Of The Year's tweet. One said: 'Bless you Andy. Fellow Scots going for the ace!' while another said: 'All power to @andy_murray - finally out for YES! It's true!' No campaigners also weighed in, with one tweeting: 'Disappointed in you andy , you may have just swayed the undecided.' Murray had reason to be particularly cautious about taking a stance, given the  reaction to his comment about football - 'I’ll support anyone that’s playing England' - eight years ago that is still held against him by some to this day. Team GB: Murray has an impressive Davis Cup record for Great Britain, winning 19 of his 21 singles matches. His future as a member of Team GB will now be in question . The day after his triumph at SW19 last year Murray declared that he would have to say something on independence but the nearest he has come to publicly expressing a view was in March last year, when he said in an interview with the Times magazine: 'I don't think you should judge the thing on emotion, but on what is best economically for Scotland. 'You don't want to come to a snap decision and then see the country go tits up. 'I am proud to be Scottish, but I am also proud to be British. I don't think there is any contradiction in that.' Display: Murray criticised Alex Salmond for unfurling a Saltire in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year . VIDEO Scottish Referendum: Polls open, voting begins . More recently he has pointed out that his view has little relevance because, as a longstanding resident of Surrey, he does not have a vote. But there have been hints of his thinking, such as criticising Alex Salmond for unfurling a Saltire in Wimbledon's Royal Box last year. In the past expressed his admiration for staunch 'No' supporter Gordon Brown, and did not give the impression of being a great enthusiast for independence. His private and professional connections make a nonsense of any suggestions that he is in some way anti-English, and he has never shied from wrapping himself in the Union Jack or made a secret of his pride in representing Great Britain. It was notable that after London 2012 he declined to appear at the parade of Scottish Olympians in Glasgow but made his own personal visit to his hometown of Dunblane.","Wimbledon champion appears to have taken a side early this morning .

"Bill Cosby's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame has been defaced with the word 'rapist'  after mounting allegations of sexual assault. On Thursday night, the word was scrawled three times on the star on the storied Walk of Fame - the stretch of celebrity themed sidewalk visited by millions of tourists every year. 'When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,' the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. 'The star is being cleaned up at this time.' Photographs taken on Friday showed workers scrubbing the stone. Scroll down for video . Defaced: 'Rapist' was scrawled over comediann Bill Cosby's star on the Walk of Fame on Thursday night . At work: Crews clean the graffiti off the star in Los Angeles on Friday. The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said it hoped people upset with Cosby would find different ways to express themselves than vandalism . The incident comes after 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, stepped forward to accuse the comedian of unwanted advances, including drugging and then raping them. In 2005, a Temple University employee accused him of an assault and - although 13 women who claimed they had similar experience were willing to testify in the case - it was settled out of court. Then two months ago, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the comedian during a stand-up set, scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape. He has most recently been taken to court by a woman, Judy Huth, who claims she was just 15 when Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974. Cosby's lawyers have said she previously tried to extort him and have requested that the case is thrown out, saying the accusations are too old. Accused: Cosby, 77, has been accused of rape or sexual assaults by at least 20 women since October. Many of the alleged attacks took place decades ago when the women were aspiring actresses . As the allegations surfaced, NBC dropped a new project with the comedian, while Netflix also shelved a one-off comedy special planned for the day after Thanksgiving. He also resigned from Temple University's board of trustees, which he joined in 1982. And on Thursday, the Navy announced it is revoking the former sailor's title of honorary chief petty officer, saying the allegations against him are serious and conflict with the Navy's core values. The 77-year-old Cosby has refused to answer questions about mounting accusations that he sexually abused several women.","'Rapist' was written three times on the star on Thursday night and crews cleaned it off on Friday morning .

Captain Vincent Kompany has also been passed fit after suffering a calf problem while on international duty with Belgium, but Fernando has been ruled for two weeks with a muscle injury and Stevan Jovetic is also out of action after pulling a hamstring in training with Montenegro. ‘Frank is ready,’ said Pellegrini. ‘He has worked for about one month and he doesn’t have any problems. Mangala is working normally and is in the squad list also. ‘We have to play three games in a week so we will see if they play in these games. Both of them are ready to do it but I can’t say which games they will play or if they will play. Fernando will miss the Emirates clash having featured in all of Manchester City's games so far this season . ‘But we have Fernando injured. He has a muscle problem, maybe a couple of weeks more and also Stevan Jovetic. He came back from his national team with a problem in his hamstring. ‘All the rest of the players are fit. Vincent played 90 minutes for his national team and he works normally with the squad during the week here so he doesn’t have any problems.’ Addressing the media for the first time since Alvaro Negredo was allowed to leave the Etihad on loan to Valencia with a view to a permanent move, Pellegrini confirmed that the striker was the odd man out in his Champions League squad after fracturing a metatarsal in pre-season, and was also desperate to return to Spain. Spanish striker Alvaro Negredo completed his loan move to Valencia from Manchester City on deadline day . Negredo’s departure after one season in English football has left City with just three recognised senior strikers. Pellegrini refused to say if they were in the running to sign Radamel Falcao before he joined neighbours Manchester United, but believes that City have enough forwards to cope. He said: ‘The decision for Negredo to go out was for two very important reasons – first of all, we had a restriction on the number of players we can use in the Champions League, we had one player more and in this case Alvaro was injured so he was not going to be on the list. ‘For him, it was also very important that he went back to Spain so I thought that was the best decision. But it all started with the restriction on the number of players. ‘It is one striker less of course, but we have Edin Dzeko, Sergio Aguero, Stevan Jovetic and other players we can use behind the strikers.

"A ship that was part of a famous fleet led by Sir Walter Raleigh, which sank without a trace, could have been found at last. Scientists are testing the remains of a shipwreck thought to be the Flying Joan, which was scuppered as the legendary explorer began his search for the ‘Lost City of Gold’. The 50ft boat set sail in 1617 as part of a fleet led by Sir Walter looking for the mythical riches of El Dorado. Scientists are testing the remains of a shipwreck (pictured) thought to be the remains of the Flying Joan, which was scuppered as Sir Walter Raleigh searched for the 'Lost City of Gold' The stricken 50ft boat set sail in 1617 as part of a fleet led by Sir Walter Raleigh (pictured) looking for the mythical riches of El Dorado . It sailed from Plymouth, Devon, towards the West Indies, but was destroyed by a huge storm and sank without a trace. The 120 tonne ship has lain on the sea bed for nearly 400 years but divers think they have finally found its remains off the coast of Cornwall, along with Tudor guns and pottery. Early analysis of the wreckage has proved inconclusive but English Heritage has this week sent off hull samples to be carbon dated by experts in a bid to solve the mystery once and for all. Divers Todd Stevens and Robin Burrows found the wreck in the summer of 2012 after using a magnetometer to pinpoint unusual objects on the seabed. They say their photos and artefacts prove it is Sir Walter’s ship, but experts have never verified the find. Divers Todd Stevens (pictured) and Robin Burrows found the wreck in 2012 after using a magnetometer to pinpoint unusual objects on the seabed. They say their photos and artefacts prove it is Sir Walter's ship, but experts have never verified the find. In this photo, Mr Stevens is holding a 'bung hole jug' circa 1550 . Sir Walter Raleigh (1554 - 1618) was an English aristocrat, writer, poet, soldier, politician, courtier, spy, and explorer. He was popular with Queen Elizabeth I and instrumental of the English colonisation of North America, paving the way for settlements in Virginia. In 1594 he heard about a 'City of Gold' in South America and sailed to find it, publishing an exaggerated account of his experiences in a book that contributed to the legend of 'El Dorado'. But after Queen Elizabeth died in 1603, he was imprisoned in the Tower of London for being involved in the Main Plot against King James I. In 1616, he was released to lead a second expedition in search of El Dorado in 1617, but it was unsuccessful and men under his command ransacked a Spanish outpost. He returned to England and to appease the Spanish, was arrested and executed in 1618. The Flying Joan, captained by John Chindley, was known to have sunk off Scilly on June 12, 1617 as it departed the West Country, led by Raleigh’s 440-tonne ship called The Destiny. The fleet of 30 ships was scattered by a storm shortly after setting sail and two ships, including the Flying Joan, sank. The expedition was Raleigh’s second . failed attempt to find a ‘City of Gold’ thought to be somewhere between Trinidad and . the north east coast of Venezuela. Mark Dunkley, maritime designation advisor for English Heritage, said the carbon dating analysis will likely take several months. ‘The remains of Elizabethan wreck sites are extremely rare and when discovered in English waters, they are considered to be nationally important,’ he said. ‘English Heritage cannot commit to any association with Sir Walter Raleigh until we have completed our investigation of the site and have analysed the results of tree-ring dating, which we will be undertaking within the next few months, to determine whether the hull timbers are Elizabethan or not,’ he added.

"The Football Association has defended its rejigged loyalty programme after coming in for criticism from England fans during Monday's European Championship qualifier in Switzerland. Over the summer plans were announced to alter the loyalty points system that rewards supporters for following the national team. The previous scheme, englandfans, saw supporters get two 'caps' for following the team abroad and one for a match at Wembley. Followers: England players celebrate with the travelling supporters after the 2-0 win over Switzerland . Mobbed: England players celebrate with Danny Welbeck after he scored the second goal to wrap up the win . However, that has been reversed under the new England Supporters Club, with those attending Wembley matches getting two points as opposed to those making the effort to go abroad. 'Two caps for Wembley, you're having a laugh' was chanted by supporters during England's 2-0 victory in Switzerland on Monday, but the FA has defended those changes. 'Our focus is on making Wembley a home for England which means well-engaged, well-rewarded loyal fans fully supporting the emerging young talent that we have in the England team,' an FA spokesman said. 'We want that team to enjoy playing in front of those fans at Wembley. 'Of course, we continue to be grateful for our amazing travelling support which is why we transferred all the caps previously earned by those supporters over to the new England Supporters Club. 'As such they will remain at the top of the priority list for tournament tickets if they continue to support England home and away, as many of them have done for many years.' Crowded out: Wayne Rooney attracts the attention of three Swiss players . That statement rankled with Steve Grant, an England fan who travels home and away to matches including Monday's game in Basle. He says those caps would have been automatically transferred under the pre-standing terms and conditions, pointing to the fact this issue is the tip of the iceberg. 'Those that travel away are the ones funding the supporters' club as a whole through subscriptions and those people are doing it to get away and tournament tickets,' Grant told Press Association Sport. 'Getting to Wembley is obviously easier than travelling to Lithuania and fans should be rewarded for their efforts. 'The FA can throw as many facts and figures about how they are 'engaging' with us, but the simple fact is that two-thirds of the paying members from the last campaign haven't renewed - a poor performance in the World Cup certainly isn't the only reason for that.

"Arsene Wenger has revealed that his biggest regret in football is missing out on the signing of Cristiano Ronaldo before the Portuguese star sealed a deal with Manchester United. The then 18-year-old signed for Sir Alex Ferguson's side from Sporting Lisbon in 2003, but Wenger believes he was 'so close' to getting there before United. Speaking to Arsenal's official smartphone sponsor, Huawei, Wenger said: 'My biggest regret, I was so close, to signing Cristiano Ronaldo, and not only did I not get him he signed for Manchester United, so that of course still hurts today.'

"Air drumming along to the radio brings limited satisfaction, but now there’s a device that can transform any object into a drum when you hit it. Cliphit is designed for people who have always wanted to unleash their inner Phil Collins but don’t have space for a drum kit. The potentially annoying gadget can be played anywhere and uses sensitive clips that, when attached to everyday objects such as a stapler or hole punch, produce a drum or cymbal sound when the objects are struck. Scroll down for video . The Cliphit gadget can be played anywhere and uses sensor clip technology that, when attached to everyday objects such as a stapler or hole punch (pictured), produces a drum or cymbal sound . Cliphit comes with four slots to plug the sensitive clips into and each generates a different drumming-related sound effect. Sound is emitted from a three-inch (8cm) speaker on the top of the battery-powered portable domed device. An ‘aux in’ jack also lets users connect external sound sources such as MP3 players so they can drum along with their favourite tunes. Cliphit comes with four slots (pictured) to plug the sensitive clips into and each generates a different drumming-related sound effect . Korg, a Japanese manufacturer of electronic instruments, makes the Cliphit and hopes that the device will enable more people to take up the drums. But because of the reasonable price point, the gadget may be used as an annoying toy. ‘Cliphit is a new electric drum kit that’s ideal for drum practice at home or for casual playing,’ a spokesman said. ‘The clips with their internal sensor attach to anything - a magazine, desk, or almost any surface, transforming it into a snare, hi-hat, or cymbal. ‘Cliphit will breathe new life into your drum practice and is a great way to enhance your experience and creativity.’ Sound is emitted from a three-inch (8cm) speaker on the top of the battery-powered portable domed device when an object attached to a clip (pictured) is hit . Sam Guy, an administrative assistant from Eastleigh in Hampshire, brought one for his office colleagues to play with on their breaks. The 29-year-old said: ‘It’s caused quite a stir in the office I must admit but even the bosses love it. ‘When I first played it I attached it to items on my desk and just started playing by striking my phone and stapler over and over again. ‘As soon as some of our favourite songs come on the radio we’re straight on the drums.’","Cliphit is made by Japanese electronic instrument maker, Korg .

"Gary Neville has criticised Manchester United’s Daley Blind for taking the ‘easy option’ and failing to provide telling passes for the team’s strikers. The Holland international has anchored United’s midfield since his £13.8million move from Ajax in the summer. But Blind and his new team-mates have made their worst start to a season since 1986 and are 10th after 10 games. Daley Blind's lack of incision has drawn criticism from former Manchester United defender Gary Neville . Blind is said to play 'too many square passes and takes the easy option' in United's midfield . Neville, though, feels the 24-year-old must start creating more for the likes of Robin van Persie, who has scored just three times this campaign. ‘He (Blind) has got to start looking up more and playing forward,’ said Sky Sports analyst Neville. ‘He plays far too many square passes and takes the easy option.’ Gary Neville (pictured talking to Sky Sports' Geoff Shreeves) hasn't been happy with Blind's contribution . Meanwhile, Neville defended Van Persie. ‘Van Persie is still making his clever movement,’ he said, ‘but I don’t think his team-mates are seeing him anywhere near as much as Scholes and Carrick were two seasons ago. ‘He lives off the back of centre-backs. We called him the burglar. But Blind takes the easy option. We’re talking about the highest calibre of player here (they should be able to make passes in behind).’ Like our Manchester United Facebook page.

"After vowing to take 'a long, long break' from acting, Leonardo DiCaprio has instead turned his attention to developing his property portfolio and has completed on deals worth more than $23 million in the past four months. The latest addition to Leo's growing real estate empire is a $10 million apartment at the health-centric Delos building in New York’s Greenwich Village. The Wolf Of Wall Street star has purchased a two-bedroom, two and half bath apartment on the fourth floor of the building at 66 West 11th St., under the corporation name of his Malibu Colony PCH Property, LCC, reports the New York Post. The latest addition to Leo's growing real estate empire is a $10 million apartment at the health-centric Delos building in New York’s Greenwich Village . The complex - which has WELL certification for its holistic approach to improving human wellness - boasts facilities including vitamin C-infused showers, purified air and water, and a circulated aromatherapy air supply. It also boasts posture-supportive heat reflexology flooring and 'dawn simulation' provided by a circadian lighting design. In addition, Donna Karan's Urban Zen is providing the building's residents with a 'wellness concierge' to ‘curate and coordinate your daily wellness experience.’ Lucky Leo has also been told he can use a $1 million parking space that comes with the building’s 8,000-square-foot duplex penthouse until that apartment is sold. Getting serious: Leonardo DiCaprio has reportedly moved his girlfriend Toni Garrn, seen here earlier this month, into his recently purchased $8 million Battery City Park apartment . Expansion plans: The actor already owns an apartment in the Battery Park City building but in March bought his neighbour's 2,300-square-foot unit for $8 million . The 39-year-old actor has been on a property buying spree recently, splashing out $8 million in March on a two-bedroom apartment adjacent to a $4 million apartment that he has owned at the eco-friendly 2 River Terrace in Battery Park City since 2008. The expectation is that DiCaprio will combine the 2,327-square-foot apartment with his existing home, although he has yet to file plans to combine the two units. According to InTouch, the Titanic actor has moved the 21-year-old model girlfriend Toni Garrn into the recently purchased unit. A source told the magazine: 'Leo bought the apartment [in March] and quickly moved Toni in with him. 'It seems like they’re really enjoying living together.' The source . added that the couple - who have been dating for almost a year - always . look 'happy' and 'relaxed' when around the exclusive Riverhouse . apartment building. Holiday home: The Wolf Of Wall Street actor also recently purchased this $5.23 million residence in Palm Springs . In February the 39-year-old actor spent $5.2 million on a six-bedroom mansion in Palm Springs, California. The 1.34 acre property has seven bathrooms, a detached state-of-the art gymnasium, a pool house and a tennis court with a glass pavilion surround. The multi-level, single-story mansion, which was designed by architect Donald Wexler, was built in 1965 and, although it's been fully renovated, it still features mid-century architecture. Leo's property empire also includes a large beachfront . estate in Malibu, California. DiCaprio, who missed out on a Best Actor Oscar for his role in The Wolf Of Wall Street, recently told Germany's daily Bild that, after working on three films in two years, he's taking a break.

"With walls that shimmer with gleaming honey-coloured amber and edged with gold, standing in the Amber Room of Catherine the Great feels like being inside a jewellery box. But while the £300 million decor is striking, what really catches the eye is the story behind the room which comes complete with a cast of Nazis, empresses and treasure hunters. Stolen by Nazi treasure hunters during the Second World War, the original amber room has never been found - leaving behind a mystery that continues to this day. The Amber Room (pictured) was called the eighth wonder of the world . The room is full of gleaming gold and amber, with every surface ornately  detailed . Intricate: The level of detailing is astounding and shows the high level of expertise needed to design and create the room . Catherine palace (pictured) was a Imperial Palace and one of the largest in the vicinity of St. Petersburg . Now a BBC One documentary Treasure Hunters hopes to shed some light on the fate of the room's original furnishings, last seen in the now ruined Königsberg Castle. The original Amber Room was completed in 1756 and housed in Tsarskoye Selo, a vast palace near St Petersburg that was rebuilt and renovated for Empress Catherine I. A later expansion under the Empress Elizabeth included the Amber Room, which was used by the Russian royals to entertain and impress foreign guests and dignitaries. The walls, covered in thousands of individual amber pieces put together to form mesmerising baroque designs, were a real statement of wealth and beauty. The walls of the golden and amber room literally gleam as they reflect off even the smallest light source . Opulent: St Catherine's Palace was expanded in the mid 1700s for Empress Elizabeth (left). The ornate Amber Room (right) was part of the project . Thousands of pieces of amber were needed for the reconstruction of the Amber Room . For centuries, the Amber Room was a symbol of Tsarist prestige and even survived the Bolshevik revolution. l . But in 1941, disaster, in the shape of the invading Nazi army, struck. Thanks to their delicacy, the amber tiles that decorated the room couldn't be moved so the retreating Russians attempted to hide them rather than risk damage. They were papered over, covered in gauze and cotton wool before being boarded up. But the Russians’ gamble failed. The Nazi’s found the treasure hidden in the walls and within 36 hours they dismantled the entire room, crated it up and it was on its way to Königsberg Castle in Prussia. Here the trail goes cold. Today Königsberg Castle lies in ruins, with no trace of the glittering treasure once concealed within. The detailed panels of the Amber Room are incredibly fragile and so as the Nazis invaded it was too difficult and risky to try to transport the walls . The Amber Room's walls, including its fine detailing as shown in these pictures, were papered over, covered in cotton wool and boarded up in the hope of protecting and hiding them from the invading Germans . Theories as to what happened to the amber that once decorated Tsarskoye Selo vary, with some concluding that it was destroyed along with Königsberg Castle, while others believe it could still be recovered. In the meantime, the palace of Tsarskoye Selo is home to a reconstruction of the room - begun in 1979 and completed 24 years later. With six tonnes of amber and gold decorating its walls, the recreation is almost as spectacular as the original. So will Catherine's Amber Room ever be uncovered? We may never know.

"Offensive: People in Beaconsfield are fighting against plans for a festival to honour Enid Blyton . Many of her books depict an idyllic vision of rural England. But the pretty market town where Enid Blyton lived is now divided – over a festival celebrating her life. Organisers are planning a week of activities in honour of the writer, who died in 1968 aged 71, and want to install a plaque to mark the spot where her home once stood. However, other locals are fighting to block the event on the grounds that much of the author’s work was ‘racist and offensive’. Many of Blyton’s 600 stories have been updated since her death to remove inappropriate content – with, for example, the golliwog owner of the Toytown garage in her Noddy books being replaced by a ‘Mr Sparks’. The festival is due to be held in June in Beaconsfield, Buckinghamshire, to mark 75 years since she moved to the town. Anthony Mealing, 63, who is  trying to stop the event going ahead, said: 'My grandmother, Annie Grigg, taught at a school near here where they had rather racist Enid Blyton stories issued free by the author to all the pupils in the 1950s. 'The moral of one of the stories is: Don’t leave any money around if there are any black children about as they will steal it. 'She was anti-Semitic and very racist. People don’t believe me because she is too high an icon, but she was.' Mr Mealing, from High Wycombe, said he did not want to see a plaque put up. He urged residents: 'Research the subject as you might find things you did not expect.' Mr Mealing’s view was criticised on the internet, with one resident writing : 'Enid Blyton was a fantastic story writer who deserves her place in history. She should be celebrated.' The festival is due to be held in June in Beaconsfield (pictured) to mark 75 years since Enid Blyton moved to the village . But a supporter of Mr Mealing wrote: 'For years there have been persistent rumours, based on recollections by some now elderly folk, that Enid B wasn’t a very nice lady. The golliwog owner of the Toytown garage in her Noddy books has been replaced by a Mr Sparks . 'One of her daughters also had a lot to say, criticising her too. Two TV documentaries about her also cast doubt about her character.' Former librarian Kari Dorme, the . coordinator of the festival being organised by the Beaconsfield Society, . says Blyton’s original works should be accepted for the time in which . they were written. She . said: 'In the early 1990s, some of her publishers made certain text . changes - mostly to bring her stories into line with modern thought and . sensitivities, particularly with regard to what some construed as . snobbish, racist or sexist attitudes. 'Even names were modernised. You have to accept them in the time in which they were written, which was at least 60 years ago. 'Her . books still sell at the rate of six to seven million copies a year, in . more than 40 languages. Enid Blyton is a marvellous story teller - a . real page turner. 'I feel that recognition should be given to the great contribution that she has made to children’s literacy.' Blyton first moved to a house in the town called Green Hedges with her husband, Major Hugh Pollock. The . author, who later divorced and remarried, spent most of her life there . until she moved into a London nursing home, where she died. The house was demolished in the early 1970s and the site is now called Blyton Close.","Organisers are planning activities in Beaconsfield where Enid Blyton lived .

"Suspected drug traffickers drove two trucks to a main avenue in a Mexican Gulf coast city and dumped 35 dead bodies during rush hour while gunmen stood guard and pointed their weapons at frightened motorists. The gruesome scene in downtown Boca del Rio yesterday was the latest escalation in drug violence in Veracruz state, which sits on an important route for drugs and Central American migrants heading north. The Zetas drug cartel has been locked in a bloody war with drug gangs for control of the state. Drugs battles: A police motorcyclist stands guard over two trucks piled with bodies which were dumped on the underpass in Boca del Rio while gunmen pointed their weapons at terrified motorists . Drugs war: Police have identified seven of the victims so far and all had records for murder, drug dealing, kidnapping and extortion and were linked to organised crime . Gruesome task: Police and Mexican army soldiers take away the 35 bodies which were dumped near Boca del Rio's biggest shopping mall. Some reports said 12 women were among the dead . Veracruz state Attorney General Reynaldo Escobar Perez said the bodies were left piled in two trucks and on the ground at an underpass near the city's biggest shopping mall and its statue of the Voladores de Papantla - ritual dancers from Veracruz state. According to some reports there were 12 women among the dead. Police have identified seven of the victims so far and all had criminal records for murder, drug dealing, kidnapping and extortion and were linked to organised crime, Escobar said. He didn't say to what group the victims belonged. Motorists caught in the horrifying scene posted message on Twitter warning that masked gunmen in military uniforms were blocking Manuel Avila Camacho Boulevard and pointing their guns at civilians. Busted: Alleged member of Mexico's Caballeros Templarios drug cartel, Saul Solis Solis (centre), and two of his accomplices are held after a separate incident . 'They don't seem to be soldiers or police,' one tweet read. Another said: 'Don't go through that area, there is danger.' Escobar said police were reviewing surveillance video recorded in the area. Mexico President: Felipe Calderon's nation has serious drug problems . Local . media said that 12 of the victims were women and that some of the dead . men had been among prisoners who escaped from three Veracruz prisons on . Monday, but Escobar said he couldn't confirm that. At least 32 inmates escaped from the three Veracruz prisons. Police recaptured 14 of them. Earlier yesterday, the Mexican army announced it had captured a key figure in . the cult-like Knights Templar drug cartel that is sowing violence in . western Mexico. Saul Solis Solis, 49, a former police chief and one-time congressional candidate, was captured without incident on Monday in the cartel's home state of Michoacan, Brigadier General Edgar Luis Villegas said during a presentation of Solis to the media. Solis is considered to be one of the principal lieutenants in the Knights Templar, which split late last year from La Familia, a pseudo-religious drug gang known as a major trafficker of methamphetamine. Drug violence has claimed more than 35,000 lives across Mexico since 2006, according to government figures. Others put the number at more than 40,000. In northern Mexico, the army announced the detention of two more suspects in a casino fire that killed 52 people last month in the northern city of Monterrey. The two men captured at a bar in Monterrey late on Monday confessed to being members of the Zetas drug cartel and participating in the attack, federal prosecutors said. Separately in Nuevo Leon, Mexican marines captured 19 alleged members of the Zetas drug cartel at a ranch that was being used as a training camp in the town of Colombia, the military announced. A navy statement said that seven minors were among those detained and that marines seized four rifles, a pistol, and several military uniforms and boots.","Corpses left in underpass near city's biggest mall .

"Myness, now 15 years old, was living with her grandmother when she first met the man who would become her husband. 'It happened when I was only 13 years . old,' she remembers. 'My friend who had already found herself a husband convinced me into . marriage.' Shocking though it might seem, Myness, then barely into her teens, had agreed to marry a man old enough to be her grandfather - and a feckless alcoholic to boot. Shocking: Myness, now 15, was married off to a feckless alcoholic when she was just 13 years old . Extreme though it might seem, Myness is by no means unique. According to World Health Organisation figures, 14.2 million girls under the age of 15 are forced into marriage each year. Most come from India, the Middle East, and like Myness herself, from sub-Saharan Africa - Niger, Chad, the Central African Republic and her home country of Malawi among them. The consequences are appalling. Along with an education and childhood cut short, girls suffer a traumatic initiation into sexual relationships, are put at risk of domestic violence and STI's, and have the chance of a career or better life taken away. Worse, many also die in childbirth or from pregnancy-related complications - the leading cause of death for girls aged between 15 and 19 years old in developing countries, according to UN figures. 'Child marriage is an appalling violation of human rights and robs girls of their education, health and long-term prospects,' comments Babatunde Osotimehin, executive director of UNFPA. 'A girl who is married as a child is one whose potential will not be fulfilled.' School: Like other child brides, Myness had to leave school after her wedding - much her grandmother's horror . Rescue: Myness, pictured with her grandmother (centre left) was rescued by a child protection team . For Myness, who lived in extreme poverty with her grandmother, the thought of swapping a life of hardship for that of a wife proved enough to convince her to give up school in order to marry. 'One . day my friend came to me and asked why I was suffering,' she remembers. 'Life was very . difficult at home. We could not even afford soap. 'My friend told me it . would be better if I got married like her, so that my husband could take . care of my needs.' One day, she was approached by a much older man from her . village who talked of giving her a better life - one where she'd never go hungry again. 'He kept pursuing . me to marry him,' explains Myness. 'He promised to take care of me, . provide whatever I wanted, and after sitting for my grade eight exams I . accepted.' But life after her marriage was not what she was expected. Not only was her new husband an alcoholic, he squandered any money he earned - leaving his child bride hungry.

'My husband was an alcoholic but because my grandmother was too poor to have me back, I decided to persevere in the marriage,' she remembers. 'He never kept any of his promises. When I asked him [about money], he told me he had already paid my dowry of 37,000 kwacha (approximately £65) and that was the money he would have used for my upkeep. 'I regretted what I’d done - my wish was to continue with education, but then I was helpless and had no one to support me.' Her grandmother, who had been reluctant to allow Myness to marry in the first place, was furious but says she didn't know how to get her grandchild back. But Myness' fortunes took a turn for the better when her grade eight exam results, which included passes in every subject, were released to her grandmother. 'I cried when I received the good news about my grandchild’s performance,' she reveals. 'I was happy, yet disturbed as I didn’t know what to do. Problem: Early marriage, such as this one taking place in Malawi, are the fate 14.2 million girls every year . 'I went back to school and talked to the teacher who advised me to seek help from the Child Protection Committee in our village to bring Myness back home.' Horrified by Myness' tender age, the Child Protection Committee, trained by children's charity Plan International, swung into action and traced the schoolgirl to her husband’s house. 'I was at home when some people [the child protection committee members] came and asked me if I was aware that I passed my exams and had been selected to join one of the best schools in my district,' remembers Myness. 'They promised to contribute part of my school fee and I decided to run away while my husband was away. 'I was afraid and thought he would come looking for me, but I have never seen him. The committee contributed some money and paid part of my school fee.' And Myness is by no means alone. Malawi remains a country with a high number of child brides, with girls living in the north of the country at a particularly high risk of being married off to anyone who can afford their dowry. The end of childhood: A child bride is pictured in Tanzania. Alemtsayhe Gebrekidan has told of how she suffered a similar fate when she married age 10 . Recently, however, tribal leaders have introduced new rules to try and reduce the number of child brides from the area and encourage more to stay in school. 'In the past, we had our own cultures that allowed us to take a girl to a man without any question, whether young or at any age,' explains Mackson Mwakaboko, a traditional leader from the Karonga province. 'The girl could be referred to as wealth. If a girl was born in a family, the father considered himself as rich.' But with fines of up to 60,000 kwacha (£87) for anyone who forces a child to marry, all that could be about to change. 'Many people are afraid of breaking them because they fear the consequences as they feel the penalties are too high that they cannot afford,' adds Mackson. While many child brides suffer irreparable damage, for Myness, now 15, her story has a happy ending. 'I'm happy I returned to school, even though there may be challenges. Some day,' she adds determinedly, 'I will be an accountant. 'Recently, two of my friends at school were planning to get married, but I discouraged them,' she adds. 'I told them my story, and they stopped all the marriage preparations and chose to continue with education.' Commenting on the case, Tanya Barron, CEO of global children’s rights charity, Plan UK, said: 'Child marriage is a pernicious practice, which denies millions of girls their futures. 'We know that girls who marry young are more likely to experience violence, abuse and forced sexual relations. They are also more likely to experience poor sexual and reproductive health, and more likely to drop out of school. 'Improving education and school retention for girls plays a crucial role in preventing early and forced marriage, and therefore helping to end the cycle of poverty and powerlessness that it causes.'

"A homeless dog rescued from a dump has become a mountaineer after trekking to 17,000ft above sea level to Mount Everest base camp. Rupee is believed to be the first dog officially recorded at the base camp after he joined owner Joanne Lefson on the trip. The dog undertook the gruelling challenge after being rescued by Joanne from a dump site in Ladakh, Northern India. Rupee, with owner Joanne Lefson, is believed to be the first dog officially recorded at Mount Everest base camp . It is a remarkable turnaround for Rupee who was hours from death when he was found by Joanne in a dump . Ms Lefson said Rupee could barely walk when she found him in Ladakh, Northern India . At just eight months old the pup was dying of dehydration and starvation when he was adopted by Joanne. She said: 'When I saw him on that dumpsite he couldn't have had more than an hour to live. He couldn't even walk ten metres without collapsing. 'The little fellow had heart, I could tell that but he was very weak from having no food and water for days, perhaps weeks.' Joanne previously hit the headlines after travelling the world with Oscar - the famous globetrotting dog. The pair visited hundreds of famous landmarks raising awareness for needy pups until Oscar sadly passed away in January this year when he was hit by a truck. Joanne adopted Rupee and fed him on a high protein diet of boiled eggs and rice. Rupee trekked for ten days to reach the base camp which is 17,000ft above sea level . Joanne adopted Rupee (pictured at base camp) and fed him on a high protein diet of boiled eggs and rice . The dog owner said Rupee loved the snow and played in it, chased it and even tried to chew . He made a remarkable recovery and it was then Joanne decided to undertake the expedition to Everest, which was originally planned with Oscar. Having originally been born in the Himalayas, Rupee's vet confirmed that he would not suffer from altitude sickness despite being more than 17,000ft above sea level. The pair were joined by Dev Argarwel, a film maker from Mumbai, who agreed to shoot the expedition. The trio flew to Delhi and visited the Taj Mahal before before arriving in Kathmandu and setting off to base camp the following day. Along with porters and guides Rupee and Joanne managed to complete the gruelling climb to base camp in just ten days. Joanne was concerned about Rupee's stamina and hired a porter to carry him in case he got tired . Rupee looks pleased as he poses in his native India before the pair moved to Nepal for the trek . Rupee and Joanne found time to visit the Taj Mahal during their trip to raise awareness of stray dogs . Joanne said: 'My greatest concern was wondering if Rupee could actually make it. I prepared for the worst and arranged an extra porter just in case Rupee needed to hitch a ride. 'A memorable part of the trip was seeing Rupee touch and walk on snow for the first time, he loved it. 'He played in it at every opportunity, chased it and even tried to chew it at times. 'There were many tourists climbing the mountain at the time and they couldn't believe that a dog was heading to Base Camp. They were jealous they hadn't brought their dogs with them for walkies too.' Her first dog Oscar became an internet sensation after he travelled the world and stopped at landmarks including the Eiffel Tower and the Great Wall of China and also flew in an airplane to promote efforts to find homes for stray dogs. Joanne originally planned to take her famous dog Oscar but adopted Rupee after her first pet died . Joanne said when she saw Rupee for the first time she could tell immediately that he had 'heart' She said: 'Oscar will never be replaced and it's been difficult trying to pick up the pieces but the one thing that keeps me going is honouring his legacy and working towards the day when every homeless dog will have a forever home. 'Oscar gave a face to the masses and made us realize that even when just one dog is adopted, we may not change the world but it will change the world for that animal forever and, it might just make it to the top of the world too. 'Rupee is simply an extension of Oscar's legacy and a fine example of what can be achieved when a homeless dog is given a second chance.' The dog lover said Rupee was an extension of the legacy of her previous pet, Oscar .","Rupee is believed to be first dog officially recorded at base camp .

"Reconnaissance photos captured by Cold War-era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the Middle East, revealing thousands of ancient cities, roads, canals, and other ruins. The archaeologists behind the new CORONA Atlas of the Middle East report that a survey of satellite images has revealed thousands of previously undiscovered sites in Iraq, Turkey and Syria – including long-lost cities that could be among the earliest in human history. ‘Some of these sites are gigantic, and they were completely unknown,’ said University of Arkansas archaeologist Jesse Casana at the launch of the atlas during the Society for American Archaeology’s annual conference on Thursday. Reconnaissance photos captured by Cold War-era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the Middle East, for instance this 1961 satellite photo shows Tell Rifaat in northwest Syria, which is now completely surrounded by a modern town . ‘We can see all kinds of things – ancient roads and canals. The images provide a very comprehensive picture.’ The images were taken by the first generation of United States spy satellites - a system code-named CORONA - dating from 1960-1972. The photos were intended to expose Soviet missile bases and military camps, reports National Geographic. CORONA images were acquired on large rolls of black-and-white film, and because no means of transmitting images remotely had yet been developed, canisters of film, once exposed, were ejected and parachuted to earth where they were intercepted in mid-air by a plane. The archive, consists of more than . 860,000 satellite images covering much of the world, was declassified by . President Bill Clinton in 1995. The 1960s image, left, captures an area of southern Iraq's marshes, many of which have since been drained, while the photo on the right shows the same location in the early 2000s . The University of Arkansas¿ Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) has now developed methods for efficient orthorectification of CORONA imagery and now provides free public access to the imagery database . Until recently the photos had limited use as the unique imaging geometry of the CORONA satellite cameras, which produced long, narrow film strips, made correcting spatial distortions in the images a laborious task. The University of Arkansas’ Center for Advanced Spatial Technologies (CAST) has now developed methods for efficient orthorectification of CORONA imagery and now provides free public access to the imagery database. The images of the Middle East have proved to be an invaluable resource in the archaeology of the region because they pre-date the widespread construction of reservoirs, urban expansion, and agricultural intensification the area has undergone in recent decades. Surveying land from Egypt to Iran - and encompassing the Fertile Crescent, the renowned cradle of civilization and location of some of humanity's earliest cities – the spy-satellite images have revealed 10,000 sites that had previously been unknown. The largest sites, in Syria and Turkey, are most likely Bronze Age cities and include ruined walls and citadels. Many of the CORONA images cover other areas of great interest to archaeologists, including Africa and China. Signs of ancient habitation are visible in this satellite image of Tell Hamoukar in eastern Syriah, which was declassified by President Clinton in 1995 . The photos were intended to expose Soviet missile bases and military camps, a missile launch site near Chelyabinsk in the USSR is outlined in this 1969 image .","Reconnaissance photos captured by Cold War-era spy satellites have tripled the number of known archaeological sites across the Middle East .

"A co-founder of the popular frozen yogurt chain Pinkberry has been ordered to stand trial on charges he beat a homeless man with a tire iron in California. A judge on Thursday denied a motion to dismiss the assault with a deadly weapon case against Young Lee. Lee is free on bail and is no longer is affiliated with Pinkberry. Legal problems: Pinkberry co-founder Young Lee, pictured with his attorney Philip Kent Cohen at a court hearing in Los Angeles last month, had illegal guns in his home, police claim. He is accused of beating up a homeless man with a tyre iron . Forty-two-year-old Donald Bolding testified this week that he was begging from drivers on a freeway off-ramp last year in Hollywood when his shirt rode up and revealed a sexually explicit tattoo. He says a man he identified as Lee got out of a car, demanded he apologize to his wife, then attacked him. Bolding was struck twice in the head and suffered a broken arm before witnesses stopped the attack. Lee's attorney claims his client was threatened by the man and thought he had a weapon. But . police believe it was the Korean-born entrepreneur who first approached . him after seeing what he deemed a disrespectful tattoo. They . believe that Lee drove over to the man, rolled down his window and . started arguing with him, before getting out to confront him. Officials . say Lee demanded that the man kneel on the ground and apologise and . even though he consented, he still attacked him with the tyre iron. Craze: Lee co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang. They opened their first shop in Hollywood in 2005, immediately gaining a celebrity following . The homeless man was beaten so brutally he had to be hospitalised. Former kickboxer Lee paints a very different picture, however. His . attorney Philip Kent Cohen last month told the Los Angeles Times: . 'The transient made explicit threats as if he had a weapon, which he may . have had. 'As the evidence comes out, the reality will be much different than has been presented. 'All of the people in the car felt at risk and felt threatened.' Lee . - who co-founded the healthy, low-calorie dessert chain - was arrested . after a witness called police and gave the license plate number of the . Range Rover involved, which was rented in Lee's name. Hugely successful: The Korean-born entrepreneur already has a conviction for possession of a firearm . Investigators later recovered the tyre iron through the rental car agency. Witnesses picked Lee from police photos and authorities obtained the warrant while the 47-year-old was traveling overseas. According . to police, a federal database alerted Los Angeles detectives that Lee . was aboard an inbound flight from Korea to Los Angeles Airport in January, when he was arrested. Lee has also been accused of owning illegal guns, according to police. Police searched Lee's Los Angeles home and fleet of luxury cars after his arrest in January this year and found two handguns, a Colt .45 and a Para Ordnance Brand .45. It is unclear whether the firearms were found in Lee's house or high-end vehicles including a 2009 Rolls-Royce Phantom, 2007 Ferrari 599 GTB and a 2010 Mercedes G Wagon. Accused: Young Lee, one of the founders of the Pinkberry yogurt chain appears during his arraignment in the Los Angeles Criminal Courts Building in Los Angeles, Monday, Jan. 30, 2012 . A police search warrant affidavit obtained by TMZ.com states that, due to a 2001 conviction for drugs possession, Lee is not allowed to 'own, buy, receive, possess, or have custody or control of any firearms'. He also has a conviction for possession of a firearm and could now face this same charge again. Lee, a kick-boxer-turned-architect-turned-entrepreneur, co-founded Pinkberry with partner Shelly Hwang, CBS Los Angeles reports. They opened their first location in West Hollywood in 2005, gaining a celebrity following and sparking a frozen yoghurt craze.","Young Lee, 47, was arrested last month and charged with assault with a deadly weapon .

"It is a ticking timebomb hidden on the chaotic streets of New Delhi. Despite India’s booming economy, millions of people are still battling for access to clean water. The situation is so desperate that many people in this teeming neighbourhood are falling sick. Others have set up illegal taps in a bid to cash in. CNN correspondent SARA SIDNER reports from the frontline of the war for water. New Delhi, India’s capital and the political heart of this diverse and vibrant country, is a vast and energetic city. One of the so-called ‘BRIC’ nations, alongside China, Russia and Brazil, the country’s growing importance and remarkable growth is delivering new wealth to many of its citizens. Around New Delhi you can see how the expanding middle classes are changing the face of India, with fresh prosperity expanding their ranks at a dramatic rate. But the city also faces a serious problem. Water, the absolute necessity for life, is becoming harder to come by. And it is not just in India’s great cities where a growing crisis is taking shape. Shazadi, a mother of six, scrubs her thin . steel dishes as hard as she can with as little water as possible. There . is only one way for her to get water: she must walk to the . neighbourhood spigot with heavy buckets, before filling them up and . lugging them home. Every one of these children, pictured on the outskirts of Delhi, India, has suffered from waterborne illnesses . But even when she gets the water back to her family, she worries whether it is actually safe to drink. 'We get sick two to three times per month,' Shazadi says. 'I cannot afford bottled water.' Her seven-year-old daughter, Moazmin, smiles and waves at us. She wants to play, but isn't feeling very well. 'My stomach aches and gurgles,' she says, before talking about the many times she has been to the hospital. There she is often given an injection, which she makes clear she is not fond of at all. There are around 100,000 people living in this neighbourhood on New Delhi's outskirts. Not one of them has ever had water piped into their homes. Instead, the government turns on just a single tap for them, just three times a day. This is how the vast majority in this part of the city gets access to water. At the pipe, people line up to fill their bottles and buckets. Children also take showers under the flowing water. The tap itself juts out just a few inches from a drain, which is littered with rubbish and sewage, as well as clumps of bright green algae. These people are among thousands in New Delhi who rely on truck deliveries for their water supply . To avoid the need to use this single tap a few enterprising people in the area have installed ground water pumps, but these are illegal. Some others get their drinking water from Prakash Sahoo. He has made a business of providing water to residents and businesses. Every day, in the baking hot sun, he rides his bicycle around the neighbourhood, making five or six trips to fill a large water container, which is strapped to the back of his bike. He is pouring with sweat as he makes his deliveries. 'There is no sanitation here, just so many complaints', he explains. 'So I thought: ""Let me get a water filter and supply clean water to these people, in order to help them and make some money""'. Prakash charges 10 rupees – not much more than 10 pence – per container. It is a price business owners can afford to pay; but as most in the neighbourhood make less than £1.50 a day, it is beyond the budget of the majority. And so, for most people in the area, simply getting clean water to drink is a struggle they face every day. India's government is not blind to the issue, and has long fought to provide enough clean drinking water for the masses. The figures, however, make worrying reading. The country has 18 percent of the world's population; but only 4 percent of the world's renewable water sources. And demand is growing. What is more, there are major problems with leaks and pollution, which strip away the supply even further. Mother of six Shazadi, pictured cleaning dishes outside her home, has to carry heavy buckets to and from the neighbourhood spigot to get water . T.M. Vijay Bhaskar, an official with India's department of drinking water and sanitation, says rural India faces a whole range of issues that are depleting its water. 'Because rural drinking water is dependent on ground water, ground water levels are going down because of exploitation by irrigation, by farmers and by industries, we are forced to drill deeper and deeper for drinking water,' he told CNN. 'And as we go deeper and deeper we find more and more contaminants. It may be arsenic. It may be fluoride. Now we are finding nitrate, iron, and salinity. Uranium is also involved in some places,' he said. India has set a national river conservation plan in place, which it hopes will reduce the pollution in its rivers. The plan includes interception, diversion and treatment of sewage, as well as low-cost sanitation works on riverbanks, and electric or improved wood crematoria for funerals. But authorities concede that India is facing what they call 'water stress' because of urbanisation, industrialisation and the ever-rising population. Some people have installed illegal ground water pumps to avoid queuing with buckets at neighbourhood water taps in New Delhi . According to the 2011 census, India’s per . capita water availability stands at 1,545 cubic meters, down from 1,816 . cubic meters in the 2001 population count. This year an acute water . shortage hit New Delhi. The city relies on other states for much of its . water supply, but now it is finding itself in a tug of war to get it . because those other states are dealing with shortages too. While this fight goes on, entire neighbourhoods across New Delhi rely on trucks to bring in the only water supply. Thirsty crowds emerge as soon as the truck becomes visible. Mother Bimla fills as large a bucket as possible, because the truck only comes to her area three times a week. Underneath the water truck children squat with little buckets, which they use to collect the drops of water spilling from the undercarriage. 'At times there are scuffles and we have to return empty handed,' says Bimla. When every drop of water matters, the fight for it is ultimately a fight for survival. For India, and its capital city, it is a fight they simply have to win.","A New Delhi neighbourhood provides a snapshot of the 'growing crisis' facing the Indian city, where water is becoming harder to come by .

"Boris Johnson says Britain ‘betrayed’ the Commonwealth by joining the European Union, and should ‘intensify’ ties with countries such as Australia. In a provocative newspaper article, the London Mayor said the UK must distance itself from Europe and seek a ‘wider destiny for our country’ further afield. As Tory ministers seek curbs on uncontrolled migration from EU countries, Mr Johnson said the Government should let in an unlimited number of immigrants from Australia. Careful, he bites: Mr Johnson with a baby crocodile in Australia last week . A fervent critic of the EU, Mr Johnson said it was time to ‘raise our eyes beyond Europe’ and not think of ourselves as ‘little Europeans run by Brussels’. ‘We betrayed our relationships with Commonwealth countries such as Australia and New Zealand, and entered into preferential trading arrangements with what was then the European Economic Community,’ he said. Mr Johnson, writing in the Daily Telegraph, has just been on a family holiday in Australia where he was the keynote speaker at the Melbourne Writers’ Festival. He told how he was approached by Australian Sally Roycroft, who had been teaching at a school in London but was forced to leave the UK because of what he called ‘disgraceful’ immigration rules. ‘She isn’t a citizen of any of the 27 countries of the European Union,’ Mr Johnson said. ‘She is Australian; and she has been told to bog off by the authorities in our country because it was, they said, too much of a palaver to go through the business of “sponsoring” her to stay. ‘That is the infamous consequence, as we all know, of a historic and strategic decision that this country took in 1973’, when Britain joined the European Economic Community, the forerunner of the EU. All things Australian: Prince Harry (left) wears an Akubra hat during a visit in 2003 to Taronga Zoo in Sydney, Australia. Prince Charles, centre in similar hat and, right, Australian actor Paul Hogan in Crocodile Dundee. The Mayor said the UK must ‘intensify’ links with the Commonwealth countries, and that ‘you could not do better than by starting with Australia’, calling for freedom of movement between the two countries by setting up a ‘bilateral Free Labour Mobility Zone’. He added: ‘I suppose there might be some objection from the EU – but they should be told firmly to stuff it. It is basically outrageous and indefensible that Sally Roycroft is deprived of a freedom that we legally confer on every French person.’ Under EU freedom of movement rules, any citizen of a European member state has the right to live and work in the UK. Just over 20,000 ‘skilled workers’ are each year allowed to come to the UK from outside the EU, but they need to be sponsored by an employer and pass a points-based assessment.","The London Mayor said UK must distance itself from Europe and seek a ‘wider destiny for our country’

"A Republican congressman from Texas has been accused of trying to damage his rival's reputation with a photoshopped image showing him with Barack Obama. An image of fellow Republican John Cornyn shaking hands with the President appeared on a website linked to Steve Stockman. But political analysts soon spotted something appeared to be awry, and claimed that the image had been doctored to try to make Cornyn appear to favor Obamacare. Fake? The photo, above, appears to show John Cornyn with President Obama . Original: Several media outlets claim the image was doctored from this 2009 photo showing Charlie Crist with Obama . The odd-looking photo first caught the attention of Politico's Burgess Everett, who tweeted a snapshot of the picture on January 21. Several news agencies found what they say is the original photo, taken by AP in 2009, which showed Obama shaking hands with former Florida Governor Charlie Crist, the Daily Dot reported. In the version that appeared on the Cornyn Loves Obamacare website, which was launched last week. the image showed the senator shaking hands with Obama. The website's homepage claims: 'John Cornyn doesn't want you to know the UGLY TRUTH about his intimate, cozy relationship with ObamaCare. He may deny it in public, but John Cornyn LOVES Obamacare.'

"A male porn star has been sentenced to 30 days in jail after admitting responsibility for the syphilis outbreak that closed down the adult film industry in Los Angeles last August. 'Mr Marcus', 42, whose real name is Jesse Spencer, contracted the bacterial infection on set before altering his syphilis-positive test so he could continue performing. The 19-year veteran pleaded no contest in . Los Angeles Superior Court where he was also sentenced on Tuesday to 36 months' probation and 15 . days of community labor. In August his admission came after the industry’s self-imposed 10 day moratorium which saw more than 1,000 performers in the LA area get tested and administered preventative antibiotics. Jailed: Porn star Mr Marcus has been sentenced to 30 days in jail after continuing to work after contracting the bacterial infection . At least nine porn stars were revealed to have contracted syphilis. Mr Marcus said: ‘I tried to cover it up…because I said it was like the scarlet letter. It’s the word. Syphilis, whoa. ‘Mr Marcus, syphilis? Mr Marcus, the one I worked with? The one that everybody works with? The one that’s been in this industry forever?’ Returned to work: His doctor said Mr Marcus would not be contagious 10 days after a pencillin shot so he returned to work at porn shoots after 11 days . A doctor told Mr Marcus that he would not be contagious 10 days after taking a shot of penicillin on July 13. With that diagnosis he returned to . work 11 days later, on July 24, still with syphilis. Instead of . presenting a paper or digital copy of the test results he showed the . producer a copy on his phone so the details about the infection were not . visible. While filming . another porn film, Mr Marcus said he folded the test to hide the . syphilis diagnosis and photocopied it but a producer noticed the results . were missing and questioned him about it. He said: ‘I have to live with this, no one else does. ‘I’m very sorry. I did not think that this would come out like this.’ The . porn star posted on Twitter yesterday: ‘You can be disappointed, but . don't throw stones. Some of you are living in glass houses.’ The bacterial infection has a 90-day . incubation period meaning a porn actor could potentially be carrying the disease . without it showing up on tests.

"They have quickly become one of the world's most feared and notorious militant groups after carrying out a series of atrocities while leading a murderous rampage across parts of Iraq and Syria. Yet, while western powers face growing pressure to step up military action against Islamic State militants, not much appears to be known publicly about its leadership, structure or even its size. A number of names however have emerged of suspected leaders of the militant group, who are believed to have directed the group as it has taken control of parts of northern Iraq and Syria. It was only last month that the first image was seen in years of ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, after he walked out of the shadows to deliver a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city . Despite the group's notoriety across the globe following its formation last year, its workings and structure has been difficult to pin down. It was only last month that the first image was seen in years of its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, after he walked out of the shadows to deliver a sermon at the Great Mosque in Mosul, Iraq's second largest city. He addressed the packed congregation – which included Isis fighters and local sympathisers – on the first Friday of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan, in the heart of the city his fighters took control of barely a month previously. His sermon came only days after he declared himself caliph, or ruler, of the world’s 1.2 billion Muslims. He also declared large swathes of northern Syria and Iraq seized by his fighters as his new caliphate. Baghdadi is understood to rule the group through a hit squad ready to assassinate subordinates who appear disorderly, along with a religious authority, according to a report by Sam Jones in the Financial Times. The report suggests the group is ruled by a shura council who divide responsibilities for specific areas among certain ministers. Omar . al-Shishani has been identified as one of the group's most prominent . commanders and may even have risen to become its overall military chief, . it has been claimed . A smaller military council is also said to exist, according to the report, below which are more officials with special responsibilities or expertise. Anthony Cordesman, a former director of intelligence at the Pentagon who now works for Washington think-tank CSIS, told the Financial Times that members of the group had 'learnt' since the insurgency in Iraq in 2006. He said: 'They have far more dispersed authority. They make sure they have two commanders on the scene at all times; they have a lack of a centralised control. Leaders set policy but they don’t attempt to plan every operation one by one.' Last week, another of the group's leaders was named in a resolution adopted by the UN Security Council  that sought to weaken militants in the region by cutting off the flow of foreign fighters and its financing capabilities . The resolution named six fighters accused of funnelling funds and helping foreign fighters travel to the frontline, including Islamic State spokesman Abu Mohamed al-Adnani. In June, al-Adnani apparently appeared in a video which featured extremists urging followers to 'march to Baghdad - we have a score to settle', as ISIS fighters made their way across northern Iraq. Despite the group's notoriety across the globe following its formation last year, its workings and structure has been difficult to pin down . A voice said to be that of al-Adnani is heard in the video saying: 'Continue your march as the battle is not yet raging. 'It will rage in Baghdad and Karbala. So be ready for it. Put on your belts and get ready.' Elsewhere, Omar al-Shishani has been identified as one of the group's most prominent commanders and may even have risen to become its overall military chief, it has been claimed. The young, red-bearded Chechen is one of the suspected leaders who has appeared frequently in its online videos, unlike other leaders such as al-Baghdadi. Al-Shishani has been the group's military commander in Syria, leading it on an offensive to take over a broad stretch of territory leading to the Iraq border. But he may have risen to become the group's overall military chief, a post that has been vacant after the Iraqi militant who once held it - known as Abu Abdul-Rahman al-Bilawi al-Anbari - was killed in the Iraqi city of Mosul in early June. Islamic State militants embrace in celebration after taking over Tabqa air base near Raqqa city on Sunday . In a video released by the group early in July, al-Shishani is shown standing next to the group's spokesman among a group of fighters as they declare the elimination of the border between Iraq and Syria. The video identified al-Shishani as 'the military commander' without specifying its Syria branch, suggesting he had been elevated to overall commander. The group however has not formally announced such a promotion. Another senior commander who appears to have few qualms over showing his face is Abu Wahib, also known as Shaker Wahib al-Fahdawi, understood to be one of the group's regional commanders. Haji Bakr, whose real name was Sameer Abid Mohammed al-Halefawi, was believed to have been the group's head military commander and security chief before he was killed in January, according to the Financial Times. Images which appear to be of a number of the group's leaders have been posted online, including on social media sites, but are difficult to verify. A man inspects damage at the entrance of a Tabqa hospital after a Syrian government air strike . United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay today condemned 'appalling, widespread' crimes being committed by Islamic State forces in Iraq, including killings, slavery, sexual crimes and targeting people on ethnic or religious grounds. The persecution and systematic violations, documented by U.N. human rights investigators, would amount to crimes against humanity and war crimes under international law, she said in a statement. 'Grave, horrific human rights violations are being committed daily by ISIL and associated armed groups,' Pillay said. 'They are systematically targeting men, women and children based on their ethnic, religious or sectarian affiliation and are ruthlessly carrying out widespread ethnic and religious cleansing in the areas under their control.' Christians, Yazidis and Turkmen are among those targeted by the Sunni militant group, she said. United Nations human rights chief Navi Pillay today condemned 'appalling, widespread' crimes being committed by Islamic State forces in Iraq. Pictured is an ISIS member in Raqqa in June this year . Up to 670 prisoners from Badush prison in the city of Mosul were killed by Islamic State on June 10 after being taken by truck to a vacant area and screened for non-Sunnis, she said, quoting survivors and witnesses to the 'massacre' as telling U.N. human rights investigators. 'Such cold-blooded, systematic and intentional killings of civilians, after singling them out for their religious affiliation, may amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity,' Pillay said. The al Qaeda splinter group seized control of the Iraqi city of Mosul on June 10, putting security forces to flight in a show of strength against the Shi'ite-led Baghdad government. Pillay, a former U.N. war crimes judge, called on the Iraqi government and international community to protect vulnerable ethnic and religious communities, including at least 13,000 Shia Turkmen in Salahuddin province besieged by ISIL forces since mid-June amid 'fear of a possible imminent massacre'.","Western leaders face growing pressure to step up action against militants .

"Lawyer Sanford Rubenstein, leaving law offices in New York City Wednesday . Sanford Rubenstein, the attorney accused of raping a woman, will no longer represent the family of a man who died after being placed in a police chokehold. Rubenstein's law partner announced Wednesday that Rubenstein doesn't want the woman's claims to distract from the Eric Garner case. Rubenstein, who hasn't been arrested or charged, denies any criminal conduct. His withdrawal from the chokehold case allows the Garner family to push forward for accountability and its day in court, said law partner Scott Rynecki, who will replace him. Garner's family has filed a notice of claim to sue the city and the police department for $75 million. A spokesman for city Comptroller Scott Stringer said Tuesday that the family's notice of claim was under review. The city's Law Department said it will review the claim thoroughly. Garner, who was unarmed, was stopped by police on Staten Island on July 17 on suspicion of selling loose, untaxed cigarettes. A video shot by an onlooker shows Garner telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. An officer responded by putting Garner in a chokehold, which is banned under police policy. Garner, who had asthma, is heard gasping, 'I can't breathe.' He was pronounced dead later at a hospital. The city medical examiner found that the police chokehold contributed to Garner's death. Police have promised to retrain officers on the use of force. A grand jury will determine whether criminal charges are filed. Garner's death has sparked protests including an August  23 march on Staten Island that drew thousands of people demanding justice. The notice of claim was filed by Rubenstein's firm. Rubenstein's accuser said the attack on her happened when she went back to his Manhattan apartment following a 60th birthday party last week for the Reverend Al Sharpton. Yesterday he blasted his former attorney collaborator in the wake of the accusations. Sharpton's highly visible move Tuesday to distance himself from Sanford Rubenstein came a day after police combed the 70-year-old civil rights attorney's apartment for evidence that could paint a picture of what happened in the hours after Sharpton's birthday bash Saturday. Scroll down for video . Rubenstein, who hasn't been arrested or charged, denies any criminal conduct. Right, Rubenstein arrives at his apartment in New York City . Among the potential evidence hauled from Rubenstein's Upper East penthouse on Monday were two bloody condoms and a sex toy. 'Even if it was consensual, why would he take a key leader of our organization back to his apartment right after a fund-raiser,' outraged Sharpton asked the . 'It's disrespectful to our movement, and the women in our network are absolutely outraged.' Sharpton told the News that Rubenstein, who's stood with the reverend at events dating back to 1997, 'has no future' at the National Action Network. A video shot by an onlooker shows Garner telling the officers to leave him alone and refusing to be handcuffed. An officer responded by putting Garner in a chokehold, which is banned under police policy. Garner, who had asthma, is heard gasping, 'I can't breathe.'  He was pronounced dead later at a hospital . Tears: Esaw Garner, wife of Eric Garner, is held by Rev Herbert Daughtry and Rev Al Sharpton during a rally held for Garner at Sharpton's National Action Network headquarters . Kenneth Montgomery, one of the accuser's lawyers, told the News: 'She’s fighting to keep her life together, keep her dignity, and not fall apart.' Neighbors and friends, meanwhile, detailed Rubenstein's seedy lifestyle of frequenting strip clubs and using his limousine to pick up much younger women, according to the New York Post. Sanford Rubenstein maintains that he had consensual sex with the 42-year-old retail executive whom he took home after the civil rights leader's birthday party at the Four Seasons last Wednesday. He has not been charged with a crime. However, the woman has told NYPD detectives that Rubenstein took advantage of her when she was passed out drunk and incapable of telling him no. Rubenstein's lawyer Benjamin Brafman issued a statement to MailOnline refusing to comment on the Post's claims, 'even those I know to be patently false.' He also reiterated an earlier assertion that Rubenstein will be cleared by the police investigation and that he did not commit a crime. NYPD detectives searched the attorney's $7million penthouse apartment on East 63rd Street in Manhattan on Tuesday and reportedly collected 'biological evidence,' according to the Post. Rubenstein lives in the $7million penthouse (left)  apartment at the top of this East 63rd Street highrise on the Upper East Side. Right: Sanford Rubenstein  seen here at a 2005 party in Miami, is accused of raping a 42-year-old woman. The woman pictured here is not his accuser . Cops also hauled away bedding, a mattress and a sex toy. The Post, quoting 'sources close to Rubenstein,' alleges a tawdry personal life that revolved around the constant pursuit of sex. One source told the newspaper: 'The guy’s hung like a cashew.' Another said: 'Every time I see him, he wants to tell me about his latest ménage à trois. It’s all about sex with this guy.' Neighbors say they often seen the septuagenarian lawyer with young women 'barely out of their teens,' according to the Post. One source says the Rubenstein is a regular at strip clubs. He reportedly spent to much time at high-end club Scores that all the strippers greeted him by name when he came in. He also reportedly paid an artist to paint a series of canvasses depicting the club - including a scene showing him getting a rub-down, the Post claims. He currently haunts at a strip club in Hell's Kitchen that features muscled, tattooed strippers who are black or Hispanic and prefers women who are 5-foot-11 or taller, the Post claims. Meanwhile, attorneys representing the alleged victim  said Monday they have 'devastating' information about the alleged crime. Close: The Rev Al Sharpton, center with Rubenstein to the left, has said there is no place for the alleged behavior - but avoided jumping to the conclusion that he is guilty . Sources familiar with the case have claimed that the 42-year-old woman, who works for Sharpton’s National Action Network, went home with the 70-year-old attorney willingly last week, and even had sex with him a second time the following morning. But attorney Keith White who represents the alleged victim has challenged these assertions, insisting that a crime had been committed. ‘There’s a lot of new information that will be devastating to Mr. Rubenstein,’ White told New York Daily News. ‘We want to give the district attorney a chance to take this information and do the right thing.‘ . White's partner, Kenneth Montgomery, accused Rubenstein and his legal team headed by Benjamin Brafman of trying to 'demonize' his client. Describing the 42-year-old as a mother and a pillar of the community, Montgomery said her 'world has been turned upside down.' Investigators suspect Rubenstein may have used an object to penetrate the 42-year-old woman during the alleged attack in his $7million Manhattan penthouse, making her bleed, sources told the New York Daily News. The anonymous accusation, which emerged Sunday, is at odds with the source close to Rubenstein, who said the alleged attack that night was in fact consensual, and that more sex followed in the morning. The claims came as investigators spent hours searching Rubenstein's apartment on Manhattan's Upper East Side for evidence. Defense: Benjamin Brafman has been taken on as Rubenstein's attorney. Above he denies all allegations to waiting reporters . On Monday afternoon, police removed a dozen evidence bags, among them one marked 'biological evidence.' They also carried a mattress out of Rubenstein's apartment. As part of the investigation, police reportedly set up a call between the alleged victim and Rubenstein, during which the woman asked the 70-year-old attorney, 'What happened last night?' The lawyer replied that they had sex but did not incriminate himself, a police source told the paper. He has not been charged with anything, though law enforcement  sources suggested to the paper that are considering a third-degree rape charge, which means the victim was incapable of consent. Rubenstein is a well-known society figure in New York and has fought high-profile cases linked to the National Action Network, often over the actions of the NYPD. Sharpton also found himself drawn into commenting on the accusations today, telling a crowd: 'I don't care how close we are - if he's wrong, he's wrong.' Although he avoided choosing one side over the other, Sharpton said there is 'no place' for the alleged behavior, the New York Post reported. He said: 'We do not justify disrespecting women. Doesn’t mean you’re guilty, but it does mean if you are, ain’t no place for that in our community.' Rubenstein and his alleged victim were both at Sharpton's lavish 60th birthday party at the Four Seasons restaurant before they went home together, along with a third person, who later left. Other guests at the bash included New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, New York governor Andrew Cuomo, singer Aretha Franklin and director Spike Lee. A police source described the case as 'a classic he said, she said'. Law enforcement sources also described how Rubenstein was allegedly called by the victim, with police listening in, in an attempt to trick him into describing the encounter. But, the source said, the call passed without incident and Rubenstein simply said that they two of them had sex. Rubenstein hit back at the claims Monday through a lawyer of his own - top New York attorney Benjamin Brafman. Brafman spoke to waiting reporters outside Rubenstein's apartment today denying any wrongdoing. He said: 'We do not believe he committed any crime whatsoever and are confident that when the investigation is completed no criminal charges will be filed'.","Rubenstein's law partner announced Wednesday that Rubenstein doesn't want the woman's claims to distract from the Eric Garner case .

"Crystal Palace fans have been urged to trust the judgement of co-chairman Steve Parish over the return of Neil Warnock as manager. Parish has been heavily criticised for his decision to bring Warnock back to Selhurst Park following the departure of Tony Pulis just before the start of the season. But Parish's fellow co-chairman Stephen Browett is convinced the right man has been appointed and appealed to disgruntled fans to support him. Trust him: Crystal Palace's co-chairman Stephen Browett is convinced Neil Warnock is the right man . Browett told the South London Press: 'People need to trust his [Parish's] judgement. He has got everything spot on so far. 'If anyone is doubting the Neil Warnock appointment then just go back to the internet posters when Tony [Pulis] got the job - it was the same then. Steve was accused of going mad. 'Steve works incredibly hard for Palace and refuses to be rushed into anything. He doesn't do spur of the moment. As soon as Tony left he spent all his time interviewing and taking advice from people within the game. 'Steve is tough as old boots and very thick-skinned. He has thought long and hard who he wanted as maanger before coming to this conclusion. He has got the full backing of the rest of us.' 'Thick-skinned': Browett says his co-chairman Steve Parish took due care and consideration before appointing Warnock for a second spell at Selhurst Park . Pulis, who guided Palace from a precarious position in the Premier League relegation zone to a final position of 11th last season, was allowed to leave on the eve of the season. After Keith Millen took caretaker charge for the opening two matches of the season, Parish announced the return of Warnock on a two-year contract at the end of August. Warnock was at the helm between 2007 and 2010, guiding the Eagles to the Championship play-off semi-finals in 2008 before departing for QPR when the club went into adminstration. And Browett insists he is the correct choice: 'He is a sensible fit. Neil is very, very experienced and is not a million miles away from Tony Pulis in management style and experience. Saviour: Tony Pulis guided Palace from the Premier League relegation zone to 11th last season but was allowed to leave the club before the start of the current campaign . 'We didn’t want radical change from what we had under Tony. 'With the group of lads we’ve got and the fantastic team spirit there, it was really important to have as little disruption as possible - albeit that when a manager walks out two days before the season starts it is impossible to have no disruption. 'Neil is a safe pair of hands - he is not going to try and reinvent the wheel.' Palace, who drew 3-3 at Newcastle United in Warnock's first match, host Burnley on Saturday. Meanwhile, midfielder Owen Garvan has moved to loan to Bolton for three months.

"The family of Eric Garner, who died after a police officer placed him in a chokehold, said Tuesday it was suing New York City and the NYPD for $75million, according to Agence France-Presse. His death brought claims of police brutality after video showed the 43-year-old being choked by an officer while being arrested for selling loose cigarettes in July. Garner, who was severely overweight and asthmatic, suffered a heart attack shortly after losing consciousness and was declared dead after being transferred to a hospital. Scroll down for video . Tragedy: Eric Garner's family addresses a group gathered at the House of Justice . In the notice of claim sent to city comptroller Scott Stringer, the family blamed the death on 'negligence, recklessness and carelessness.' The filing is the first step necessary to sue the city, and it also names eight officers and the NYPD in the claim. In July, officers confronted Garner, who was selling untaxed cigarettes in the northeastern Staten Island neighborhood of Tompkinsville. When Garner resisted attempts to arrest him, NYPD officer Daniel Pantaleo put him in a chokehold and along with several other officers, pushed him to the ground. The man began to complain of having trouble breathing and died of a heart attack . Chokeholds were banned by former NYPD chief Ray Kelly in 1993, though a report released Tuesday by the Civilian Complaint Review Board shows their use continues under different names.

"A woman whose car tumbled 500ft down a mountainside, landing upside-down, was found after police used the Find My iPhone app to track her whereabouts. The 28-year-old woman, identified as Melissa Vasquez, was driving on Mount Hamilton near San Jose, California, when her vehicle careered off the road at 3pm on Monday afternoon. As it tumbled down the slope, through thick trees and shrubs, it came to a halt  500ft from the top of the track . Officers began a 15 hour search to find her but were only able to pinpoint her location after guessing the password to her iPad and using the app to find her. Scroll down for video . Wreckage: The 28-year-old woman identified as Melissa Vasquez, was trapped underneath her white Chevy for 17 hours after crashing Monday afternoon . Good detective work: One police officer was able to guess Ms. Vasquez's password and was then able to activate the Find My iPhone app which showed her location with pinpoint accuracy . Apple's Find My iPhone app locates users with a database of Wi-Fi hotspots, cell phone tower locations, as well as the GPS satellite system, and tracks users over time. By comparison, General Motors' OnStar system which the woman's car was equipped with. relies solely on the GPS system. Many smartphone apps that provide navigation information keep track of users' locations over time. but OnStar doesn't work in quite the same way. It only keeps track of users locations at discreet moments in time, such as when an accident happens or when they call in to get driving directions from a particular place. Victim: Ms. Vasquez, was conscious when investigators found her, and could airlift her to safety . Officers were able to track Melissa Vasquez, 28, using the Find My iPhone app location . After using the iPhone app, police contacted other authorities in the area with her iPhone's pinpointed location, and by 5:30 a.m. a sheriffs deputy spotted her car in a steep ravine. The woman had been thrown from the car and was lying face down. The U.S. Coast Guard helicopter were called to airlift her from the scene and be taken to hospital. 'I am amazed that occurred,' Campbell Police Capt. Gary Berg said of finding the woman through the app. 'I hate to think what the outcome would have been.' The search initially began  after the OnStar satellite tracking system on her 2012 Chevy Cruze sent out a distress call. Police spent two hours searching the area for her car, but found no sign of it. The search resumed the following morning after the woman's stepmother called police to report her missing after she failed to return home. It was at that point officers had the idea of using the tracking app to find the missing woman. Rescue: The 28-year-old was airlifted to safety and is  in stable condition . Off road: The Chevy left the road at this bend, on a route round Mount Hamilton, near San Jose, CA . Rescuers: Emergency services traced the woman's cellphone to find her on the wooded slope . After two hours, the woman's cellphone provider said the phone was within a seven-mile radius of downtown San Jose, Berg said. Campbell Police notified San Jose police, who searched the downtown area, but also could not find any sign of the car. Campbell police issued a 'be on the lookout' with the vehicle description to all law enforcement agencies in Santa Clara County. At 3 a.m. Tuesday, the woman's family contacted Campbell police to report her missing, Berg said. 'The family was extremely concerned about her,' Berg said. 'At that point it raised our concern it was something more than on On-Star issue.' Officer Dave Cameron went to the family's home and asked if the woman has a iPhone. Cameron then helped the family use the woman's iPad to use the Find My iPhone, which gave them a location near Mount Hamilton. Berg said Cameron guessed the woman's password - on the third or fourth try - to unlock the iPad and the Find My Phone app. Cameron, who has been an officer with the department since 1998 and has a mind for computers, tinkered on a computer at Vasquez's home, until he figured out her password. 'I just tried to make an educated guess,' he said, describing himself as a 'tech geek.' Area: This is the steep, wooden slope down which the car tumbled a distance of 500ft with the woman inside . If you have an apple device -- an iPhone, iPad or a Mac - you can use the Find My iPhone feature to locate your device on a map. It'll even play a sound so you can track it down. And if you think your phone was stolen or lost, you can lock it and then track it. Or just erase all the information on the phone. All you have to do is log into your iCloud account and activate the app. Campbell police then contacted the CHP and Santa Clara County Sheriff's Office at about 4 a.m. with the new information, including a screen shot of where the iPhone was located. It was 'dead on,' Berg said. When officers found her she was conscious, but said she could feel pain in her lower body, a California Highway Patrol spokesman said. The woman, who lives in Campbell, California, was flown to the San Jose Regional Medical Center, and had arrived by 9am. She is believed to be in a stable condition. Authorities said windy conditions made it harder for the chopper to operate.

"Leonardo Ulloa smiles a lot. That should be noted because even when conversation turns serious, a flash of his sizeable gnashers is not far behind. At 28 years old, he is finally performing at a level he has worked so hard to reach. From a small city in the heart of Argentina he moved 1,000 miles from home, aged 15, to gain attention for his football and then relocated to Spain six years later to support his wife and baby daughter financially. One season in La Liga with Almeria stood out among many more at the second tier, before Nigel Pearson took a calculated £8million gamble to bring him from Brighton to the  Premier League this summer. Leicester City's Argentinian striker Leonardo Ulloa celebrates scoring the winner against Stoke last week . Ulloa also scored this bullet header against Arsenal in what has been a superb start to his Leicester career . Suffice to say, Ulloa’s arrival in Leicester — who face Manchester United at home — was starkly different to that of compatriot Angel di Maria. But strikes against Everton, Arsenal and Stoke have earned his new team five points and give cause for his sunny demeanour as he talks about his tough career, his enlarged family and the tattoos that run along his left arm. ‘I would not change anything of what I have been through to get here,’ says Ulloa, briefly speaking Spanish. ‘What I am doing now is the fruit of what I fought for. Ulloa spent much of his career in the Spanish lower divisions after joining Castellon in 2008 . ‘This year I said to Brighton I would not stay because I had a very important chance and I did not know if it would come again.’ In English, he adds: ‘Because I came from the Championship, maybe people did not expect this from me. But I am a striker and I work every day for that. Now I need to work more because I want to continue to score goals and help the team.’ There are moments that make Ulloa turn sombre, such as when he discloses that his father Adrian Segundo — who he calls ‘Daddy’ in English — has not been able to watch him this campaign as he awaits surgery on his stomach in Argentina. Then there is the tattoo of a symbol representing his grandfather Jose Omar, who would stand over the grill during weekly barbecues and feed his 11 children and their offspring before sitting at the head of the table to hold court. This graphic shows the vast number of South Americans that are now playing in the Premier League . ‘He was really important to the whole family,’ says Ulloa. He kisses that tattoo on his wrist after each goal before pointing to the sky. He also has inkings in tribute to his two girls Sofia and Morena, aged seven and one. ‘This is the time when my daughter Sofia was born,’ he says, pointing to a clock face. ‘And this is the dove of peace for Morena.’ Ulloa grew up in General Roca, a city of 86,000 people in northern Patagonia. Unlike Buenos Aires, home of Sergio Aguero, or Rosario, birthplace of Di Maria and Lionel Messi, few talent-spotters frequent Roca. Arsenal's Chilean forward Alexis Sanchez is another South American who moved to England this summer . He made the lengthy journey to Comodoro Rivadavia to play for Comision de Actividades Infantiles (CAI) aged 15, eventually being spotted by Buenos Aires team San Lorenzo two years later. ‘CAI is a community team that brings young players from Patagonia and develops them,’ explains Ulloa. ‘It was my chance. My mother suffered a lot. She has three sons and I am the youngest. It was hard but worth the pain.’ Aged 21, he joined Castellon in the Spanish second division. ‘I had a wife and a daughter and I was obliged because things were not good. I had no other path.’ There were 16 goals in his debut season but Castellon got relegated in his second. Almeria took him to La Liga in June 2010 and the following January, Ulloa scored an instinctive goal to earn a point against Real Madrid. Argentina's Angel di Maria has joined Manchester United, along with fellow South Americans Marcos Rojo and Radamel Falcao . ‘It’s difficult to explain,’ he smiles. ‘We lost 8-0 against Barcelona and then drew 1-1 with Real Madrid. We played all the time to avoid relegation, but I enjoyed it.’ The drop followed once more, though. That triggered his most prolific spell to date — 28 goals in 38 Segunda Division games. In January 2013, Gus Poyet paid £2m to take him to Brighton and 26 goals in 58 games later, Pearson made him Leicester’s No 1 target. The club record fee was a risk but Esteban Cambiasso has also arrived and Ulloa is grateful he can pick the brains of the Argentine star in his native tongue. But when it is proposed the two are close, he jokes: ‘He’s not my friend!’ Ulloa says of Saturday’s game: ‘We need to have the ball because when United have it, it’s very complicated. I watched the first half against Queens Park Rangers — and Falcao was only on the bench!’ Ulloa was a popular figure at Brighton where he scored 26 goals in 58 games after joining in January 2013 .","Leonardo Ulloa has three goals in four games for Leicester City .

"Fresh accusations are flying at two arms of Rupert Murdoch's media empire as the British Parliament accuses the media mogul of offering big bucks to U.S. soldiers in exchange for a photo of ousted Iraqi president Saddam Hussein in his underwear. The new accusations came during a new debate over reforms suggested by the Leveson Inquiry, and how Murdoch's News Corp got their hands on the photo, taken in an Iraqi prison, that showed the dictator in nothing but his skivvies. The image was splashed across the covers of News Corp publications The Sun and the New York Post in May 2005. Humiliation: The photo was published in May 2005 editions of the New York Post and The Sun . The Sun headline read, 'The Tyrant's in His Pants' while the Post went with 'Butcher of Saghdad.' Now, British lawmakers are charging that Murdoch and other News Corp senior officials are snubbing authorities as they investigate allegations of phone hacking against the firm. 'I urge the [News Corp. Management and Standards Committee] to provide all the emails from Rupert and [his son] James Murdoch to News International staff as a matter of urgency... in particular to the photo of Saddam,' Labour Party MP Chris Bryant told the UK's Parliament. He added it was 'difficult to see' how editors and the reporters involved 'could possibly pretend that they did not know' they obtained the photograph. He demanded answers 'otherwise, people will conclude in this country that News International is still refusing to cooperate with the police.' President George W. Bush had ordered an investigation into how The Sun and the Post obtained the photos, but never found the source of the leak. The Sun’s former managing editor Graham Dudman said at the time that his newspaper paid ‘more than £500 (about $800)' for the photos, but Bryant he had information from 'two well-placed people inside News International' that the newspapers paid 'a substantial sum' to a serving member of the US armed forces. He added that 'a much larger amount was then paid via a specially set up account in the United Kingdom' to the same source. Some reports put the figure at $100,000. Probe coming? Rupert Murdoch’s (right) media firm News Corp could be investigated over claims it obtained photos of the late Saddam Hussein (left) wearing only his underpants in an Iraq jail by bribing a U.S. official . Comment: The Sun's former managing editor Graham Dudman said at the time his newspaper paid 'more than £500' for the photos, but the Daily Beast had now claimed the 'payment was significantly greater' Mr Dudman . said at the time that US military sources handed over the photos to deal . ‘a body blow to the resistance in Iraq’ and that the picture was . obtained by ‘professional journalistic methods’. The Daily . Telegraph has claimed a Sun photographer was sent to California to buy . the pictures. US military officials believe the photos were taken at the Camp Cropper . prison near Baghdad at a time from January to April 2004, before Hussein . was due to be tried for crimes against humanity. Unsuccessful probe: Former US president George W. Bush ordered an investigation into how the Sun and New York Post newspapers obtained the photos, published in May 2005, but never found the source of the leak . Unhappy: News Corp reacted angrily to the new allegations of bribery put forward by the Daily Beast, claiming it was 'just a lame attempt to regurgitate old news' and 'all of this was widely reported on in 2005' A spokesman for News Corp said: ‘We didn’t believe then, and certainly don’t believe now, that it . was wrong to acquire and publish newsworthy photographs of a notorious . war criminal.’ 'We didn’t believe then, and certainly . don’t believe now, that it was wrong to acquire and publish newsworthy . photographs of a notorious war criminal' News Corp spokesman . More than 50 people have been arrested by the Metropolian Police as they investigate alleged payments to public officials in Operation Elveden, but detectives involved with the inquiry are not thought to be probing the Hussein photo. One of those arrested in the probe was Mr Dudman - although he has not been charged with any criminal offence in Britain. Operation Elveden - the investigation into alleged corrupt payments to public officials and other information leaks - is being run alongside two other operations looking at allegations of phone hacking and accusations of computer hacking. News Corp is already being probed in the US by the FBI and other American agencies over whether it committed any crimes under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act by bribing public officials in Britain. The Act means US-owned companies which are proven to have bribed public officials can be fined and senior executives sent to jail. Hussein was executed 18 months after the pictures were published.","Sun managing editor said it paid 'more than £500' for controversial photos .

"Men who were bitter at losing a game of beer pong at a house party opened fire on partygoers, striking one, police have said. Decoris 'Red' Rucker Jr., 24, and Chris 'Crazy Chris' Hackett allegedly played the drinking game with three other men in the backyard of a home in Ames, Texas early Monday when an argument erupted. The men pulled out guns and started running through the home 'firing wildly' at partygoers, witnesses told Liberty County Sheriff Deputy Stephanie Walden, who responded to the call at 1.20am. 'Several witnesses told Deputy Walden that five men from the Cleveland area... became upset about losing at a game,' Captain Ken DeFoore of Liberty County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. Outburst: Decoris 'Red' Rucker Jr., 24, allegedly opened fire after his team lost a game of beer pong at an early-morning house party on Monday. One girl was shot and Rucker also sustained a gunshot wound to his leg . After opening fire, the men fled the scene of the shooting in a 2006 silver Buick. One partygoer, 19-year-old Daihza Jarde Jackson, suffered a bullet wound to her left thigh and was rushed by ambulance to St. Elizabeth Hospital in Beaumont, where she is in stable condition. Just over an hour later, Rucker - one of the alleged shooters - arrived at the emergency room at a Kingwood Hospital with a gun shot wound to his leg. 'Rucker reported to authorities there that he had been shot at some unknown location in the Cleveland area,' police said. Scene: The gunfire erupted at this home in Ames, Texas after the game between a group of men on Monday . Injured: Rucker, pictured left in a previous mugshot and right, fled the scene with another gunman but turned up at hospital an hour later to seek treatment for his gunshot wound. Officials are searching for the other men . Authorities recovered several spent hulls from the scent and investigations are underway. No arrests have yet been made, but authorities expect to charge the men with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, as well as other possible charges. 'As of this early stage of the investigation, no arrests have been made and more statements are being taken from the large number of witnesses attending the party,' the statement goes on to read. Previous reports show that Rucker was arrested in May after he was allegedly found to be in possession of a cache of illegal substances, including Ecstasy, cocaine and marijuana. Drinking game: The men had been playing beer pong (file picture) in the backyard when violence erupted . His criminal background includes two burglary of a habitation charges, assaults and other other drug charges, and in 2011, he was sought for questioning by police in relation to stolen weapons. Police are still seeking the identities of the other three men who fled the scene. Anyone who knows the men's whereabouts are urged to call the Liberty County Sheriff's Department at 936-336-4500.","Decoris 'Red' Rucker Jr., 24, and Chris 'Crazy Chris' Hackett 'opened fire on partygoers after losing a game of beer pong in Texas early on Monday'

"Finally found: The remains of 14-year-old Nicholle Coppler were found under a house in Lima, Ohio. She went missing in 1999 . The skeletal remains of a 14-year-old runaway, who went missing in 1999, have been found after the home where she was last seen was demolished, according to police. The remains of Nicholle Coppler were found in a crawl space as the home's foundations were being dug out on Saturday. The girl, from Ohio, was identified by dental records, according to Allen County Coroner Gary Beasley. The home in Lima was owned by Glen Fryer, who had been a suspect in Miss Coppler's disappearance. Fryer killed himself in 2002 when he was 55, while in prison for the rape of a 12-year-old girl. The home was demolished after the state took possession due to unpaid taxes. Miss Coppler's remains were the only ones found. The girl's mother Krista Coppler, who now lives in Florida, said: 'I knew in my heart it was Nicholle. 'I knew in my heart she never left that house.' Lima Police Chief Kevin Martin said the . discovery meant the homicide investigation has been reopened. Police . said Fryer had also been linked to human trafficking. Distraught: Krista Coppler, Nicholle's mother (left) visits the house where her daughter's remains were found and is comforted at the scene (right) Cold case: Lima Police said the murder investigation would be reopened after the teenager's remains were found on Saturday . Chief Martin said: 'Our goal is still the same: Try to get to the truth. Where exactly that will lead us I cannot say.' 'I knew in my heart it was Nicholle. I knew in my heart she never left that house.' Lieutenant Jim Baker said detectives believed Fryer was involved in the girl's death but that there were other suspects also considered. Police said others knew that the girl was in the house, as at least two other people lived in the home with Fryer. Mrs Coppler said she didn't believe the investigation into her daughter's disappearance had been handled properly in 1999 but that police have since changed policy on runaway teenagers. She said: 'If, in Nicholle's name, she can save some other girls, some good can come out of this.' Miss Coppler was last seen on May 15, 1999 and was known to be in the company of Fryer in June. Suspect: Rapist Glen Fryer was believed to have been involved in Miss Coppler's disappearance . Fryer was arrested on August 30, 2001, and . charged with multiple counts of rape and child pornography involving . local girls. When police searched his house, they found Miss Coppler's ID, photos of her and a hair accessory containing her hair. Fryer pleaded no contest to four counts of rape of a minor on February 14, 2002. He had agreed to talk about Miss Coppler as part of a plea bargain but hanged himself in his jail cell five days later. In 2006, the Coppler family's hopes . of finding the missing girl were dashed after the police searched land . next to Fryer's house with cadaver dogs but found only animal bones, . according to the Toledo Blade newspaper. Authorities initially classified Miss Coppler's disappearance as a runaway. Prior to going missing the ninth-grader had been missing classes at Lima High School and her grades had slipped. Her mother said she had made a new group of friends which changed her behaviour. It is believed she may have been forced into prostitution by Fryer and was killed when she refused to comply. According to the Charley Project, which investigates cold cases, Miss Coppler's diary was also found at the home, which Fryer shared with his mother. In the last entries, the teenager reportedly said she was sorry for running away and wanted to go back to her family - but that the people she was with wouldn't let her leave. Mystery: Miss Coppler's bones were found in a crawl space of the home owned by Glen Fryer, a rapist who killed himself in 2002 . Before being convicted of rape, . Fryer, a Vietnam veteran, was believed to have been involved in the . murder of his ex-wife Connie Ferenczi. Ferenczi . was shot dead at her Ohio home in 1980. Another man was charged with . her murder but during his trial it was implied that Fryer hired him to . murder his estranged wife. The . man was acquitted by a jury and Fryer was never arrested as there was a . lack of  evidence. Fryer consistently maintained his innocence in .

VIDEO Bradford striker Stead reveals what Jose said in Bantams dressing room . Bradford beat Chelsea 4-2 at Stamford Bridge to progress to the fifth round of the FA Cup on Saturday . Mark Yeates beats the Chelsea defence and slots home past Petr Cech to make it 4-2 to Bradford . And that show of professionalism wasn’t something that went unnoticed. ‘He is an incredible manager and an incredible guy and that was a touch of class from him.’ Stead told talkSPORT. ‘He came in, he shook everyone’s hand, came round all the staff and players, and as he was going he said, “big balls, big balls!”’ It’s not the first time Mourinho has opted for that expression this season, either.

"Forget all the bells and whistles of today’s smartphones, these high-tech models are being abandoned in favour of the flip and ‘brick’ style devices of the 1980s and 90s. Celebrities including Anna Wintour, Rihanna and Kate Beckinsale have all been spotted on vintage handsets in recent months. So much so, there are now even crossover devices designed to look like retro handsets but with many of the functionalities of modern-day smartphones. Earlier this year, Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour (pictured) was spotted using a flip phone at the US Open in New York. It was believed to cost just $15 (£10) In particular, the Binatone Brick resembles the Motorola’s DynaTAC device from 1984. It can be used for calls, when used with a pay-as-you-go or contract SIM card, and it also connects to smartphones over Bluetooth. The £28 device even has a version of Snake installed. Demand for these old-school phones is so high, some models of old Nokias, Ericssons and Motorolas are fetching up to €1,000 (£810 or $1,360) a piece online. While they may lack features, these retro phones are simple to use, have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible compared to their smartphone equivalent.

It can be used for calls and also connects to smartphones over Bluetooth . Other celebrities including singer Rihanna (pictured left) and actress Kate Beckinsale (pictured right) have also recently been spotted using flip phones in place of modern smartphones . Demand for these old-school phones is so high, some models of old Nokias (Nokia 8210 pictured), Ericssons and Motorolas are fetching up to €1,000 (£810 or $1,360) a piece. While they lack features, these retro phones are simple to use, have batteries that last the week and are practically indestructible . ‘Some people don't blink at the prices,’ said Djassem Haddad, who started the site vintagemobile.fr in 2009. ‘The high prices are due to the difficulty in finding those models, which were limited editions in their time.’ For instance, a Nokia 8800 Arte Gold was recently listed on the site for €1,000 (£810 or $1,360), while a Nokia 8800 could be purchased for €250 (£200 or $337). Mr Haddad had been hoping to explore what he believed to be a niche market, but since last year, sales have taken off. The £28 Binatone device even has a version of iconic mobile game Snake (pictured on a Nokia) installed . In October last year, an unlocked 8GB iPhone 2G was being offered for £1,399 ($2,190), while another 16GB version was available from the U.S for $1,499 (£957). The trend for retro gadget's celebrity status was cemented in September when Vogue editor-in-chief, Ms Wintour, was pictured glancing at a dated-looking flip phone at the US Open. The 64-year-old fashion maven was seen peering at a device, which appeared to be a $15 pay-as-you go phone from AT&T. In October last year, an unlocked 8GB iPhone 2G was being offered for £1,399 ($2,190), while another 16GB version available from the U.S for $1,499 (£957) Vintage handsets are also said to be growing in popularity because they are more secure than smartphones. For example, they don’t connect to the cloud so photos and other details can’t be hacked into easily. This year was the 20th anniversary of the world's first smartphone, called Simon (pictured left next to an Apple iPhone) August saw the 20th anniversary of the world's first smartphone, called Simon. The phone was developed by firm IBM and the American cellular company BellSouth. IBM said it was called Simon because it was 'simple and could do almost anything you wanted'. The Simon, with its green LCD screen, had a stylus with touchscreen technology. Software allowed users to write notes, draw, update their calendar and contacts, and send and receive faxes, as well as allowing calls. It even had a slot for cartridges that were primitive 'apps'. But at around nine inches long (23cm) it was also about half the size of a house brick. It had an aerial and its battery lasted just an hour when making phone calls. It also weighed the same as half a bag of sugar. The battery life is much longer, up to a month on standby in some cases, and they are more robust, especially if dropped. New York Times journalist Michael Musto recently said: 'Call me a Luddite, the flip phone makes perfect sense to me. 'After all, my apartment still has a VCR and an array of ’90s club costumes and magazine clippings, all of which prove surprisingly useful from time to time. I even have a landline phone. 'If I were suddenly seen taking notes on an iPhone instead of on my usual stained napkin, it would look as wrong as red and green after Christmas.' Earlier this year, a team of designers created a video that plots the major milestones in the 40-year history of the mobile. It starts with the original DynaTAC, and ends with last year's Apples iPhone 5S. The first cellular voice calls were made in 1973 and it took ten years for the first handheld phone, called the DynaTAC 8000x, to go on sale. Since then the number of phones has risen to more than 6 billion and the video shows how market leaders of the 1980s and 90s, such as Nokia and Motorola, have made way for the likes of Apple and Samsung. And it’s not just smartphones that are being ditched in favour of older gadgets. Last month, reports said celebrities are also switching digital cameras for Polaroids following Apple’s iCloud leak. Celebrities such as Miley Cyrus, and members of the public alike, are embracing retro technologies in order to keep their pictures private - and on paper. Sales of Polaroid cameras, which were particularly popular in the 1980s, and produce a developed film image, have risen by around three quarters in less than a year. Kaley Cuoco, who stars in The Big Bang Theory declared: ‘Polaroids are the way to go. 'No one can get those.’ Her comments were made following a recent spate of iCloud leaks, which saw private photos of more than 100 celebrities, including Jennifer Lawrence and Kate Upton, leaked online. The popularity of the retro camera has been attributed to people’s love of Instagram, as well as the number of celebrities embracing the devices, including Lana Del Rey. A Polaroid photo forms the front cover of Taylor Swift’s new album, 1989, making the format fashionable again, too.

"A stick insect measuring almost two feet long has been discovered by biologists in a remote jungle in Vietnam. Entomologists working for the Royal Belgian Institute of Natural Sciences have announced the discovery of two new species and one subspecies of Phasmatodea - the scientific name for stick insects - found during their expeditions in the country's remote forests. The giant insect has also entered the record books - it is officially the second-largest stick insect ever found. The subspecies, named Phryganistria heusii yentuensis (pictured), was found in a Vietnamese nature reserve northeast of the capital Hanoi . Entomologist Joachim Bresseel pictured with the enormous stick insect as it dangles from his hand . Measuring 32cm in length or 54cm with its legs spread, Phryganistria heusii yentuensis is closer in appearance to a small branch than a stick. It is second in size only to a stick insect found in Borneo which measures more than 56cm with its legs outstretched. The record breaking insect was found in the Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve, 150km northeast of the Vietnam capital Hanoi. Researchers found it during an expedition launched after they realised stick insects in Vietnam remain vastly understudied in scientific records. Their method in capturing the insects was also remarkably basic - they beat trees with a pole until the insects fell to the ground. Stick insects are mostly active at night and are adept at mimicking the form of sticks and leaves - even performing a rocking motion similar to that of a stick blowing in the wind. The discovery is considered a giant step towards documenting the various types located in Vietnam, where only 70 species have so far been recorded. Scientists responsible for the latest discovery alone collected hundreds during their recent expeditions, which need to be named and categorised - giving an indication as to the vast numbers yet to be discovered. The insect was found in the Tay Yen Tu Nature Reserve, located in northern Vietnam (pictured) Measuring 54cm in length, the insect takes on the appearance of a small branch when in the wild . Look closely: The stick insect is pictured here as it clings upside down to a branch . Southeast Asia is believed to have the greatest diversity of stick insects on the planet. They are herbivores that feed on leaves, but are subject to predation themselves which they combat using a number of different defence mechanisms. These include changing colours to suit their background like that of a chameleon, mimicking a branch in the wind by slowly swaying back and forth, or simply playing dead.

"Professor Kaper says that disappearance of a Persian army in 524 BC has been solved, thanks to deciphering ancient temple blocks (pictured) In 524 BC, a Persian army of 50,000 men sent by King Cambyses II marched into the Egyptian desert from Thebes - now known as Luxor. But, after entering the desert, they were never heard from again. For centuries. it has been presumed they were swallowed by a sandstorm, but now a researcher claims that wasn’t the case - and instead they must have been defeated in battle. In the 5th century BC, Greek historian Herodotus wrote that the disappearance of the army could be attributed to an unfortunate end involving sand dunes. University of Leiden Egyptologist Professor Olaf Kaper, however, disagrees. ‘Since the 19th century, people have been looking for this army: amateurs, as well as professional archaeologists,’ he said. ‘Some expect to find, somewhere under the ground, an entire army, fully equipped. ‘However, experience has long shown that you can't die from a sandstorm, let alone have an entire army disappear.’ Professor Kaper is now putting forward an entirely different explanation. He argues that the army did not disappear, but was instead, defeated. ‘My research shows that the army was not simply passing through the desert; its final destination was the Dachla Oasis,’ he said. ‘This was the location of the troops of the Egyptian rebel leader Petubastis III. ‘He ultimately ambushed the army of Cambyses, and in this way managed from his base in the oasis to reconquer a large part of Egypt, after which he had himself crowned Pharaoh in the capital, Memphis.’ According to Herodotus, Cambyses II - the son of Cyrus the Great - sent the soldiers from Thebes to attack the Oasis of Siwa in 524 BC. Their mission was to destroy the oracle at the Temple of Amun after the priests there refused to legitimise his claim to Egypt. But after they left, they were never seen or heard from again . Herodotus wrote that the disappearance of the 50,000-strong Persian army (illustrated here) could be attributed to a sandstorm. Professor Kaper, however, claims Egyptian rebel leader Petubastis III ambushed them - but this embarrassment was swept under the rug by King Cambyses II . Kaper said he made the discovery accidentally. In . collaboration with New York University and the University of Lecce, he . was involved for the last ten years in excavations in Amheida, in the . Dachla Oasis. And earlier this year, he deciphered the full list of titles of Petubastis III on ancient temple blocks. ‘That’s when the puzzle pieces fell into place’, said the Egyptologist. ‘The temple blocks indicate that this must have been a stronghold at the start of the Persian period. ‘Once . we combined this with the limited information we had about Petubastis . III, the excavation site and the story of Herodotus, we were able to . reconstruct what happened.’ According to the Greek historian Herodotus (484-425 BC), Cambyses, the son of Cyrus the Great, sent the soldiers from Thebes to attack the Oasis of Siwa in 524 BC. Their mission was to destroy the oracle at the Temple of Amun after the priests there refused to legitimise his claim to Egypt. After walking for seven days in the desert, the army was said to have arrived at an 'oasis', which historians believe was El-Kharga, 120 miles (190 kilometres) west of the Nile in the Libyan Desert. After they left, a great sandstorm sprung up and they were never seen again. Herodotus wrote 'a wind arose from the south, strong and deadly, bringing with it vast columns of whirling sand, which entirely covered up the troops and caused them wholly to disappear'. However, the new research by Professor Kaper says it wasn’t a sandstorm at all that defeated them - but rather another army in an embarrassing defeat, which was later covered up. The fact that the fate of the army of Cambyses remained unclear for such a long time is probably due to the Persian King Darius I, who ended the Egyptian revolt with much bloodshed two years after Cambyses’ defeat. He attributed the shameful defeat of his predecessor to natural elements, and 75 years after the events, all Herodotus could do was take note of the sandstorm story. But now this new research sheds light on one of the greatest archaeological mysteries of all time.","Dutch professor believes he's solved the mystery of missing Persian army .

"Brendan Rodgers hailed Liverpool’s fighting qualities after they overcame a huge fright to make a winning Champions League return. Steven Gerrard held his nerve to fire in a last-gasp penalty, which secured a 2-1 win against FC Ludogrets, but that was only after Liverpool had conceded a 90th minute equaliser to substitute Dani Abalo following another defensive mix-up. Mario Balotelli had earlier opened the scoring but while he was delighted to get Group B off to a winning start, Rodgers admitted there was significant room for improvement in the quality of Liverpool’s performance. Brendan Rodgers praised Liverpool's fighting spirit after they beat Ludogorets 2-1 at Anfield . But the Liverpool manager did say his side would have to improve tactically in the Champions League . ‘If you can win your home games and pick up points away from home, it gives you a chance,’ said Rodgers. ‘We are not at the standard we were last season. We have a lot of players who have come in and are still adapting. We are a work in progress. ‘I thought we showed great determination. At times we had quality and then in the final third we couldn’t make that final pass. Tonight was about perseverance, an attribute you need to have. We kept going. It is a competition that is about winning and winning games. Sometimes you will play well and not get a result. ‘It was very important to be back in the competition. It was always going to be a tricky tie. Technically they were very good. We had to show patience, change the shape from 4-3-3 to a diamond. Mario gets a great goal. I am disappointed with the equaliser we conceded . Mario balotelli scored his first goal for the club after signing from AC Milan this summer . It was Liverpool's first Champions League match since they lost to Fiorentina at Anfield in 2009 . ‘But maybe in the first six months we would have drawn but we showed the experience and character in the group, the young kid (Javier Manquillo) in the box pushing hard to get something and he gets his reward in the penalty that Stevie scores.’ Balotelli came to life after he scored his goal, almost grabbing another with a thumping drive, and Rodgers believes the goal will do wonders for his confidence following his high profile switch from AC Milan. ‘Mario is used to scoring,’ said Rodgers. ‘He had two games when he hadn’t scored. I just feel with him, he needs to be in the box more. I said to him at half-time “make sure when the ball is in wide areas, make sure you are penalty spot and in” ‘He is 6ft 3ins and great in the air. He shows great touch and the finish was a wonderful touch. On top of that I thought he worked very hard. He is still trying to get fit but he showed us his quality.’ Ludogorets thought they had secured an unlikley point after Dani Abalo scored a late equaliser . After conceding an equalise in the 90th minute, Steven Gerrard than converted a penalty to win it . Rodgers, whose side now travel to FC Basel – thumped 5-1 by reigning champions Real Madrid – on matchday two, admitted that Liverpool have to learn to concentrate until the very end if they are to achieve his target of progressing to the knockout stages. ‘No question,’ he said. ‘I think certainly tactically there are questions asked. This is a tournament where mistakes get punished. We made one. The home games are very important for us. Away from home you have got to be compact and impose your style on the game. That is very important. ‘Anfield cranks itself up in terms of the noise level on nights like this. I am happy for the supporters; they are back in the competition they are synonymous with. It was a wonderful occasion and great to have that feeling of being back in the competition.’ VIDEO We showed great resilience - Rodgers .","Liverpool played first Champions League match since 2009 .

"Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane following a remarkable fightback by Kurdish forces who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying. The extremists  have abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east of the city, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said. As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent, with the massively outgunned Kurdish fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre. But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days and force those remaining back into the outskirts of the town. Scroll down for video . Power: Smoke rises in Kobane after a U.S. airstrike destroys an ISIS-held building. The extremists have now abandoned all of their positions in the city, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east .

Now ISIS are on the back foot . Guard: An armed man loyal to the Kurdish People's Protection Unit stands near Kurdish flags on Tel Shair hill in the west of  Kobane this morning. As recently as Monday an ISIS flag was flying over the hill . News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes. Turkish and U.S. officials last week said that ISIS was on the verge of taking Kobane from its heavily outgunned Kurdish defenders after seizing strategic points deep inside the town. But as the tempo of coalition air strikes increased  over the past few days, amid claims the warplanes were coordinating the raids with Kurdish fighters on the ground, ISIS's advances dramatically slowed. The militants were eventually forced to flee from almost all of their locations in the south and west of the city, including the strategic Tal Shair hill, as well as abandoning a number of key buildings and neighbourhoods in the east. Despite their gains, Kurdish leaders say Kobane cannot survive long-term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders, something Turkey - which lies just 200 yards to the city's north - has so far refused to allow. The news comes as the new UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra'ad al Hussein, described ISIS as the antithesis of human rights and 'a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement'. 'The way it has spread its tentacles into other countries, employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe, reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age,' he added.

A photograph taken from Sanliurfa in Turkey, shows smoke rising from Kobane following a U.S. airstrike . As many as 30 Britons may now have died fighting for terror groups in Syria, it was reported on Wednesday night. Researchers believe 24 jihadists have been killed fighting with Islamic State and other groups but think the true figure is higher. Hundreds, and possibly thousands, of Britons are believed to have fled to Syria and Iraq to join radical Islamic groups such as Islamic State (ISIS) and the Al Qaeda affiliated Jabhat al-Nusra. But despite the deaths and the mounting political pressure on extremist groups both at home and abroad, there remains little consensus on how prevent radicalisation of more British nationals. Shiraz Maher of the International Centre for the Study of Radicalisation at King's College London said death reports were rising but it remain hard to verify. Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on Kobane a month ago. Meanwhile more than 160,000 people have fled the mainly Kurdish town. Yesterday the U.S. State Department revealed that one of its officials has held direct talks with a Syrian Kurdish group involved in the fight against ISIS. It is the first time such talks have taken place. Earlier a Kurdish spokesmen said their forces had been providing American warplanes with the precise coordinates of the militants' positions in and around Kobane. ISIS has been keen to take Kobane to consolidate its position in northern Syria after seizing vast swathes of territory both there and in Iraq. A defeat in Kobane would be a major setback for ISIS. Heavy and light weapons fire were audible from across the border in Turkey yesterday afternoon, with one stray mortar hitting Turkish soil close to abandoned tents. Turkish security forces moved civilians and media away from hills overlooking Kobane as the fighting raged. Displaced: Syrian Kurds who fled fighting in Kobane are seen at a refugee camp in the Turkish border town of Suruc in both this picture and the one below . Flee: Rows of tents are seen in a refugee camp in the Turkish border town Suruc. The camp has become home to thousands of Syrian Kurdswho fled the fighting in Kobane . Six air strikes hit eastern Kobane and there was fierce fighting between Kurdish and Islamist fighters overnight on Wednesday, but neither side made significant gains, according to the British-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. Kurdish fighters later managed to seize a street in Kobane that had been held by militants, it added. A journalist inside Kobane said air strikes had allowed Kurdish forces to go on the offensive for the first time since Islamic State launched their assault four weeks ago. 'We walked past some (YPG) positions in the east yesterday that were held by IS only two days ago,' Abdulrahman Gok said. 'Officials here say the air strikes are sufficient but ground action is needed to wipe out IS. YPG is perfectly capable of doing that, but more weapons are needed,' he said, referring to the acronym for the Kurdish People's Protection Units. Islamic State militants have publicly beheaded two of their own fighters after they were accused of 'banditry' and spying on behalf of the Syrian government. The executions took place in the Syrian city of Al-Bukamal after the two men were arrested by members of the terror group's police force and brought before a Sharia law court. One of the men was successfully tried on charges of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money', while the second man was convicted of 'spying and embezzlement', with both being sentenced to being beheaded in the centre of Al-Bukamal, which is on the Euphrates River near the border with Iraq. News of the executions came from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based group monitoring violence in Syria using sources on the ground. The first man, they said, was convicted of 'banditry and robbing Muslims' money' - a charge likely to have been linked to the practice of money lending or usury. The second militants was accused of 'dealing with the regime and throwing electronic chips to keep track of Mujahedeen,' according to the Observatory. The use of the phrase 'electronic chips' is understood to refer to small geolocation devices that can be hidden inside ISIS-held buildings or vehicles belonging to senior militants. The devices can then provide Syrian regime warplanes with detailed information on which to base a bombing raid.

Syrian Kurdish children who fled fighting in Kobane  walk hand-in-hand at a refugee camp in Turkey . Abandoned cars and Kurdish Syrian refugees are seen in 'no-man's land' near the Turkey-Syria border today . ISIS' Kobane offensive is one of several it has conducted after a series of lightning advances since June, which have sent shockwaves through the region and sparked alarm in the West. U.S. officials have ruled out sending troops to tackle the group, but Kurdish forces have been identified as viable partners for the coalition, and Kurds in Iraq have received western arms shipments to bolster their cause. No weapons or ammunition have reached Kobane, however, fighters there say. Islamic State terrorists last night released another propaganda video featuring British hostage John Cantlie, who warns of an impending third war in the Gulf. In a video clip posted online, the abducted photojournalist, who describes himself as the 'British citizen abandoned by my government', accuses the western media of being complicit with America and its allies in trying to drum up support for a ground war against ISIS. He said: 'Obama is terribly busy insisting US ground troops won’t be going back into Iraq. Thus even the Pentagon admits airstrikes are a stop-gap military measure that will not disrupt the Islamic State actvities' Captive: A still from the newly-released video of British Hostage John Cantlie. The photojournalist has been a captive of ISIS for two years . He added: 'Meanwhile, America puts 1,200 troops into Baghdad to protect their embassy and the airport. Surely sounds like boots on ground to me… The rise of the Islamic State give Obama a chance to look tough in the media just as midterm elections approach.' In tonight’s professionally-produced video, the 43-year-old captive from Surrey – wearing a Guantanamo Bay-style orange jumpsuit – said Obama's use of the plight of the Yazidi minority, which has suffered greatly at the hands of ISIS, as justification of military force is disingenuous. He said: 'Since when has America cared about the fate of a minority in the Muslim lands? 'Modern history is sadly littered with religious minorities being crushed and neither the U.S.  nor anyone else said anything.' Mr Cantlie, a photojournalist who was kidnapped in Syria two years ago, also said the public is wrong to support the airstrikes.

"A writer who worked on hit HBO series Sex and the City has revealed that there were 'big arguments' about whether or not the show's central character Carrie Bradshaw should end up with her on-again-off-again lover Mr Big. In an interview with Elle.com, Liz Tuccillo admitted that the show's writing team were on the fence about how to end the final season of the series, in which Carrie is swept off her feet by long-time love Big while in Paris. Surprisingly however, the arguments were not due to doubts over which man shoe fan Carrie, who was played by actress Sarah Jessica Parker, would end up with, but rather because the team were unsure whether she and her co-stars should all end up in the arms of a man. Scroll down for video . Happily never after? Sex and the City writer Liz Tuccillo has revealed that there were many arguments over whether or not Carrie and Big should end up together in the final episode of the show (pictured) The perfect ending: Eventually the writers, including Liz (pictured), realized that a relationship with Big is what Carrie would have 'chosen as her happy ending' '... Carrie Bradshaw couldn't be happy unless she had a guy,' Liz, 50, said. 'That's what kills me.You want to know something serious? That was the big argument when we were ending the show. All of us were arguing about it. 'Not just that she ends up with Big, because I think we all knew, even if we didn’t want to admit it, that she was going to end up with Big. But the fact that all of the women end up with someone. 'That was a huge conversation in the writer’s room. We felt a big responsibility to end the show right. And by having every character with somebody, it means that ultimately, the show is about finding love in the big city and we’re going to be optimists and say that everybody’s found it. Everybody’s happy.' Eventually, the show's writers went with their initial instincts, and in the last episode of the sixth and final series, an estimated 10.6 million fans watched as Carrie, Samantha, Charlotte and Miranda all ended their six-year run on-air in happy relationships. Six years in the making: Carrie and Big's on-again-off-again relationship spanned all six seasons of the show . The end of an era: All four of the show's central characters (pictured left to right: Miranda, Charlotte, Samantha and Carrie) eventually found love . It was, Liz added, the perfect way for Carrie to find true happiness. 'For Carrie Bradshaw, specifically, she believes in love, and her idea of love is always with that perfect guy,' she said. 'Or not perfect, at all. Perfect for her. That's what she would choose as her happy ending. And we wanted to write that for her.' Shortly after the final episode of Sex and the City aired on HBO, Parker, who also served as an executive producer on the show, told TV host Larry King that she was 'thrilled' with the final ending. 'I was really thrilled; I was very pleased,' she said. 'And I think the most gratifying part of it is that I just think the viewers seem to be  happy with the choices we've made. 'And that of a great concern to me that we did right by them... I feel that they have been an enormous part of this show and any success that we've experienced. 'And so I wanted very much for them to feel that we didn't bail, that we did right by them and that we honored the characters that we had been playing and illustrating for so long.' Mr Big . Fans were thrilled to see Carrie end up in the arms of Big, with whom she had enjoyed an on-again-off-again relationship which spanned all six seasons of the show. While their turbulent six-year relationship was not always the easiest of romances, both actress Sarah Jessica Parker and Sex and the City director Michael Patrick King later revealed that they knew deep down he was the person Carrie was meant to end up with. Aidan Shaw . The only people sad to see Carrie and Big finally find happiness were those who had been rooting for her lovable ex-boyfriend Aidan. The furniture designer did all he could to win the heart of Ms Bradshaw - including moving into her apartment and proposing - but the couple were unable to make it work in the end. Jack Berger . Opinions were divided over whether or not Berger was a suitable match for Carrie. While they seemed compatible on the surface, Berger's insecurity about his own career eventually led to the end of their brief relationship when he broke up with Carrie on a post-it note. Aleksandr Petrovsky . Russian artist Aleksandr came into Carrie's life during the final season of the show, when he whisked her away from her friends and her life in New York, in favor of a whirlwind romance in Paris. Once there however, their romance falters, leaving Big with the perfect opportunity to stage a romantic rescue and return Carrie safely home to New York.",Liz Tuccillo revealed that the show's writers were torn as to whether all four women in the show needed a man in order to live happily ever after .

"The future of the chief of police in Ferguson remains unclear amid reports he will step down from this position as soon as next week as the aftermath of the Michael Brown shootings continues to reverberate across the city. Police chief Thomas Jackson is expected to announce plans to leave his post as part of an effort to overhaul the city's police department, CNN is reporting, citing 'government officials'. The move is said to be part of an attempt to show the people of Ferguson the department is taking action regardless of the result of the grand jury trial of Darren Wilson, the officer that killed Brown. It could also be a way of offering the community a 'sacrificial lamb' in the case of the grand jury deciding not to indict Officer Wilson. CNN is reporting that the announcement could come next week. Scroll down for video . 'Stepping down': Ferguson Police Chief Thomas Jackson will step down from his position next week as part of an effort to overhaul the city's police department, according to reports . Jackson has faced major backlash over the way his department handled the shooting of Michael Brown in August . 'The animosity that existed in Ferguson were way before Mike Brown's shooting, justified or not. So, unfortunately, the leadership in the police department has to change,' said CNN legal analyst Mark O' Mara. 'And if he's sort of a sacrificial lamb to get this started, it's going to have to be. Ferguson's going to have to more forward. And it doesn't seem they can move forward with this police chief in place.' As part of the plan the St. Louis County police chief will step in as the interim chief for Ferguson. However the reports are being shot down by Jackson and the local press. 'It’s absolutely not true. Nobody has asked me to resign nor have I been fired,' Jackson told the St. Louis Post Dispatch. Similarly, in a sit-down interview with CNN late last month, Jackson apologized for the way his department handled the Brown incident and its aftermath, with police clashing with protesters. However he maintained he would not be stepping down. 'I've talked to a lot of people who have initially called for that and then changed their mind after having meetings and discussions about moving forward,' Jackson said on September 29. 'Realistically, I'm going to stay here and see this through. 'This is mine, and I'm taking ownership of it.' Missouri police have been brushing up on constitutional rights and stocking up on riot gear to prepare for the grand jury's decision about whether to charge Darren Wilson. The preparations are aimed at avoiding a renewed outbreak of violence during the potentially large demonstrations that could follow an announcement of whether the officer  will face a criminal trial for the August 9 death of Brown. Shot dead: Michael Brown was unarmed when Wilson encountered him walking in the street with a friend . Scene: This image shows investigators inspecting the body of Michael Brown Saturday August 9, 2014 . Aftermath: Demonstrators protest following the shooting death of 18-year-old Michael Brown . Police and protesters have repeatedly clashed since the shooting, which prompted a national conversation about race and police tactics. Grand jury proceedings are secret, but legal analysts say recently leaked information about Wilson's testimony to investigators may be an attempt to prepare the public for the possibility that he might not be charged. The decision could be made public within the next month. In the meantime, law officers have adjusted their tactics for interacting more peacefully with protesters while also honing their procedures for quick, widespread arrests. They plan to have a large contingent of officers at the ready, but have been meeting with clergy, community leaders and students in hopes of building relationships that could ease tensions on the streets. Law enforcement officers expect to receive at least a day's notice before a grand jury announcement. That should provide time for them to execute security plans but may also allow demonstrators to prepare.","Police chief Thomas Jackson could be forced out of his post as soon as next week, it is being reported .

Balotelli, making his Anfield debut after a £16million move from AC Milan, appeared to be targeted by Villa to try and make him lose his temper, particularly when Philippe Senderos kicked him off the ball. Substitute Raheem Sterling was also the victim of a bad, late tackle from Alan Hutton. But any collateral damage in public relations terms will hardly dampen Villa’s spirits after Agbonlahor celebrated his new four-year contract with a goal poacher’s effort after nine minutes.

Manager Lambert will point out that only one Villa player, Hutton, was booked and on Saturday only Chelsea sit above them in the Premier League table. Even though £25m England midfielder Adam Lallana and Manchester United reject Tom Cleverley were making club debuts, one-man publicity machine Balotelli was predictably the centre of attention. Super Mario’s name was cheered louder than anyone else’s and a Liverpool lap-dancing club hired a plane to fly overhead and advertise their wares. Being photographed outside such an establishment was one of Balotelli’s many misdemeanours during his eventful spell at Manchester City. Even with golden boy Sterling left on the bench following his England exertions and Daniel Sturridge out with a thigh injury picked up on international duty, Liverpool made a bright start with Lazar Markovic attempting an ambitious volley from Alberto Moreno’s cross that flew just too high. But Villa were surprisingly adventurous to and there had already been a couple of panicky moments in the home defence when they struck. Ashley Westwood’s corner was met by the head of Senderos. Javier Manquillo blocked unconvincingly and before he could have a second go at clearing, Agbonlahor nipped in to scoop the ball in from a prostrate position. It was the striker’s second goal in consecutive games. Lallana, who had signed from Southampton early in the summer but sidelined by a knee injury until now, showed his frustration by going in late on Cleverley and collecting a booking. The Kop then vented their displeasure when lax Liverpool marking allowed Senderos a free header from Westwood’s free-kick which he missed. As for Balotelli, he was quiet but certainly not anonymous, certainly not to the Villa antagonists. Andy Weimann claimed, unconvincingly, that Balotelli had dived after the Villa man had clipped him from behind. More seriously, the Italian hit the turf again when Senderos kicked him in the calf while referee Lee Mason was looking elsewhere. The Swiss defender was trying to stop Balotelli running into the area and was lucky it went unseen. If Villa assistant Roy Keane – never popular at Anfield – had dared to appear in the technical area before he finally appeared to galvanise the troops in injury-time, you would imagine he’d have been pleased with his centre-half. Then, Hutton caught Balotellli by the touchline, high on the thigh. It was to Balotelli’s credit he kept his cool and even applauded The Kop as he was substituted after a frustrating day.

Data courtesy of the EA SPORTS Player Performance Index, the Official Player Rating Index of the Barclays Premier League . The only piece of real link-up play between him and Lallana in the No 10 role came when Balotelli laid off and Lallana hit a rising half-volley wide with Brad Guzan well beaten. Balotelli’s only other moment was a spectacular solo strike that was deflected for a corner after he’d been brilliantly picked out by Gerrard. Following an insipid start to the second-half, Rodgers succumbed to the temptation of throwing on Sterling after an hour even though he ideally wanted him rested for Tuesday’s Champions League opener against Ludogorets. Within seconds he turned on the turbo’s to reach Philippe Coutinho’s pass and was flattened by a late tackle by Hutton, who was booked. It says a lot for 19-year-old Sterling’s ability how quickly Liverpool now regard him as the go-to man following Luis Suarez’s departure. He was joined by fellow subs Rickie Lambert and Fabio Borini for the last 20 minutes, a remarkable turnaround for Borini who rejected moves to Sunderland and QPR on transfer deadline day. It was Coutinho who came closest to proving an equaliser though. He twisted his way to the edge of the Villa penalty area before hitting a strike against the post with Guzan rooted to the spot. Ultimately though, on a day of great expectation on Merseyide, it was the underdogs who were able to celebrate as they maintained their unbeaten league start to the season, achieved without star defender Ron Vlaar. Last week, the film ‘One Night in Istanbul’ about Liverpool’s legendary 2005 Champions League Final win was premiered to great acclaim in the city.

"One man went above and beyond to surprise his girlfriend with a very romantic engagement.

"ISIS fighters are being trained to fly three captured fighter jets at an air base in Syria, observers claimed yesterday. The reported flights are believed to be the first time the militant group has taken to the air and raises the possibility of attacks on British, US and French targets in neighbouring Iraq. Rami Abdulrahman, who runs the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, said the militants were flying the planes on ‘short flight’ training at the al-Jarrah military airport east of the city of Aleppo, where the group has a major base. Fighter: It is not clear if ISIS' jets are equipped with weaponry nor if the pilots are able to fly long distances, but witnesses said the planes appear to have been seized from the Syrian Air Force (pictured) Power: ISIS has been steadily building a full-equipped military - including large tanks, such as the one pictured here in Raqqa). Much of the equipment in their possession has been seized from Syrian regime forces . Show of strength: ISIS militants take part in a military parade along the streets of Raqqa earlier this year . ‘They have trainers, Iraqi officers who were pilots before for (former Iraqi president) Saddam Hussein,’ Mr Abdulrahman said. ‘People saw the flights, they went up many times from the airport and they are flying in the skies outside the airport and coming back,’ he added, citing witnesses in northern Aleppo province near the base, which is 45 miles south of Turkey. It was not clear if the jets were equipped with weaponry or whether the pilots could fly longer distances. Witnesses near the base in northern Syria said the jets appeared to be decades old MiG21 or MiG23 models captured from the Syrian military. Twitter accounts linked to ISIS, also known as ISIL and Islamic State, had previously posted pictures of captured jets in other parts of Syria, but the aircraft had appeared unusable, according to analysts and diplomats. The group has captured several major military airfields, including the vast Tabqa complex, close to their headquarters in the Syrian city of Raqqa and seized aircraft, helicopters and heavy weapons. The base was reportedly one of the Syrian military’s largest facilities in the region, with several warplane squadrons, helicopters, tanks, artillery and ammunition. Defence analysts say that it unlikely the group's MiGs could be used conventionally as the US-led coalition of Syrian forces would shoot them down. Leader: News of ISIS' test flights comes as Al Qaeda - which has previously condemned ISIS for being too brutal - ostensibly sought to repair ties with the group led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi (pictured) Declaration: Titled 'Statement on the Crusader Coalition', the document is Al Qaeda's strongest show of support for ISIS since leader Ayman al-Zawahiri denounced the group for the brutal tactics late last year . Islamic State militants have been almost entirely driven out of the Syrian city of Kobane after a fightback by Kurdish forces, who vowed to either defeat the terrorists or die trying. The extremists  have abandoned all their positions in the city except two small pockets of resistance in the east, Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal said. As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobane was imminent. The massively outgunned Kurdish fighters had been pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents facing rape and massacre. But with the help of the most intense U.S. and Arab bombing raids of the anti-ISIS campaign so far, the Kurdish forces have been able to kill hundreds of militants over the past two days. They have also managed to force the militants have not been killed to retreat further into the outskirts of the town. News that ISIS have been almost entirely forced out of Kobane comes after two days of heavy air strikes by U.S. warplanes. Instead, they could be deployed for spectacular low-level suicide attacks on western targets in the Kurdish city or Irbil or the Iraqi capital Baghdad where the US and Britain have a major presence. The U.S. military said yesterday it was unaware of any flight operations by the group ‘in Syria or elsewhere’. ‘We’re not aware of ISIL (IS) conducting any flight operations in Syria or elsewhere,’ said Central Command spokesman Colonel Patrick Ryder. ‘We continue to keep a close eye on ISIL activity in Syria and Iraq and will continue to conduct strikes against their equipment, facilities, fighters and centres of gravity, wherever they may be,’ he added. Meanwhile Kurdish forces, backed by US-led air strikes, are said to be continuing to make gains in their fight with militants in the key northern Syrian town of Kobani. US-led warplanes again struck militants' positions yesterday, taking advantage of new coordination with the town’s Kurdish defenders, who are identifying targets. Kurdish commander Baharin Kandal claimed the extremists have abandoned all of their positions in the town, except for two small pockets of resistance in the east. As recently as Monday it looked as if the fall of Kobani was imminent, with the massively outgunned Kurdish fighters pushed back ever closer to the city centre by ISIS militants advancing into the suburbs, leaving hundreds of mainly elderly residents fearing rape and massacre. Advance: The Islamic State and its allied Sunni militants seized the Anbar city of Fallujah, parts of Ramadi and large rural areas of Anbar early this year . Checkpoint: Earlier today, Iraqi officials in the western Anbar province said a curfew has been imposed in the provincial capital Ramadi (pictured) over fears that the Islamic State group might try to advance on the city . Security: ISIS has been making gains around Ramadi in recent weeks against the embattled Iraqi military, despite ongoing U.S.-led coalition airstrikes on the militants . Activists say more than 600 people have been killed since the jihadist group launched its assault on the mainly Kurdish town a month ago. Capturing the town would give the jihadists unbroken control of a massive stretch of the Syrian-Turkish border. Despite their gains, Kurdish leaders say Kobani cannot survive long-term without arms and ammunition reaching the defenders. Claims of Kurdish successes in Kobani came as the new UN human rights commissioner, Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein, described ISIS as the antithesis of human rights and ‘a diabolical, potentially genocidal movement’. ‘The way it has spread its tentacles into other countries, employing social media and the internet to brainwash and recruit people from across the globe, reveals it to be the product of a perverse and lethal marriage of a new form of nihilism with the digital age,’ he added. Six senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban have pledged allegiance to the Islamic State and its leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a symbol of the terrorists' expanding influence among Islamist groups. Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS. The move is likely to have serious consequences for security in Pakistan, particularly near the Afghan border where all six of the men are based, leaving it open to the kind of violence and brutal oppression ISIS has employed in the vast swathes of Syria and Iraq under the group's control. Militants: Withdrawing their loyalty to the Afghan Taliban's leader Mohammad Omar, the men - made up of the group's chief spokesman Shahidullah Shahid (centre) and five regional commanders - said they will remain members of the Pakistani Taliban, but added they now consider themselves affiliates of ISIS . The official announcement of the six men's declaration of allegiance to ISIS came in the form of an audio recording that emerged on Wednesday. However rumours had been circulating for weeks that several senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban were set to declare their loyalty to al-Baghdadi. 'I show allegiance to the commander of faithful, Caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi Qureshi al Hussaini, and will listen and obey every order of you and will follow your orders regardless of what circumstances may be,'  Shahid said in the recording. There is now concern that other senior figures in the Pakistani Taliban may defect to ISIS, including the group's overall leader Maulana Fazlullah, who has previously voiced support for the terror group. Despite several members having declared their ISIS sympathies, the announcement is the first time any senior figure within the Pakistani Taliban has actually sworn allegiance to al-Baghdadi.","Witnesses say ISIS are carrying out test flights at an airport near Aleppo .

"Two leading players questioned why there was no ambulance on site after Fabrizio Zanotti was struck on the head by a ball in the KLM Open on Thursday. Zanotti was on the 16th fairway at Kennemer Golf Club when he was hit by an errant drive from France's Alexandre Kaleka on the 14th. According to the European Tour, Zanotti did not lose consciousness and received treatment on the course from a doctor and a paramedic before he was taken to hospital. VIDEO Scroll down to watch KLM Open - Round 1 highlights . Fabrizio Zanotti of Paraguay is attended to by medical staff after being struck while Alexandre Kaleka  looks on . Zanotti thanked his followers for their support  and confirmed that he would be taking time away from golf . An ambulance eventually arrived and took Zanotti to hospital but he fortunately never lost consciousness . VIDEO KLM Open - Round 1 highlights . The 31-year-old from Paraguay was accompanied by fellow players Felipe Aguilar and Ricardo Gonzalez, who withdrew from the tournament to stay with their friend. Zanotti was later discharged from hospital and wrote on Twitter that he would now take a few weeks off, but the incident caused a delay of almost two hours and left Italian pair Edoardo Molinari and Matteo Manassero particularly unhappy. In reference to the death of caddie Iain McGregor in Madeira earlier this season, Molinari wrote on Twitter: 'Seems like @fabrizanotti is ok. How is it possible there is no ambulance on site after what happened in Madeira.' Manassero added on Twitter: 'Let's hope now that the second incident will guarantee ambulances on site for everybody's safety.' In a statement released to Press Association Sport, tournament director Miguel Vidaor said: 'Fabrizio received impeccable medical care and attention from the team of doctors and paramedics who were already on site as part of the tournament and who are fully equipped to deal with any medical emergency. 'They subsequently deemed it necessary for Fabrizio to go to hospital as a precaution for further assessment and we are pleased to report that he has been discharged after receiving the all clear.' KLM Open director Daan Slooter added: 'We have worked with The European Tour to upgrade the medical provision at this year's KLM Open. 'Unfortunately, there was not an ambulance on site, as requested by The European Tour, since we took the decision not to have one because the first aid provision on site was capable of dealing with an incident like this, and indeed any other medical emergency. Manassero said he hoped the second accident in a short time period would lead to a change in policy . 'Let's hope now that the second incident will guarantee ambulances on site for everybody's safety,' he tweeted . 'The hospitals nearby and the ambulance system in Holland could respond quickly if further assistance was required, and indeed the ambulance responded within the parameters of Dutch law. In light of what happened with Fabrizio, we now have an ambulance on site for the remainder of the tournament.' Zanotti had started his round from the 10th and was level par after six holes when the incident occurred. Molinari carded an opening 66 to lie one shot off the lead held by defending champion Joost Luiten and Scotland's Jamie McLeary. Luiten carded four birdies, an eagle and just one bogey in his 65, while McLeary joined the Dutchman on five under with a birdie on the 16th just before play was suspended for the day. Play in the first round will resume at 8am on Friday. Alexandre Kaleka looks nervous as he watches his fellow professional receive treatment after being hit . 'It is always nice to shoot a 65,' said Luiten, who had downplayed his chances of a repeat victory on Wednesday. 'I played well and didn't make any mistakes. That's the key on this course, keep the ball in play and take your chances. For me it was a good solid round and I hit some nice spots. 'Sometimes you can be conservative and take irons off the tee but if you feel good with the driver you have to hit it and make a tough hole into a birdie hole. It all depends how the winds are but I was hitting my drive well and I tried to take advantage of that.' Italy's Andrea Pavan and France's Gary Stal were alongside Molinari on four under, with Ryder Cup player Thomas Bjorn and vice-captain Miguel Angel Jimenez off the pace on one over.","Zanotti struck on the head by Alexandre Kaleka's shot .

"The rise of breakfast biscuits may have seemed enough of a naughty start to the day for some but the latest food trend to hit the UK gives early birds an even sugary hit at the crack of dawn. It comes in the form of Italy's tasty answer to ice cream - gelato. Making its way over from Italian shores, the UK's first-ever breakfast gelato menu has launched at Comboco in Soho, London. But judging by the array of flavours, it is likely to test even the most sweetest-toothed individuals. A sweet treat: The latest breakfast craze to hit the UK from Italy is gelato, and it comes in a range of quirky flavours . There's cereal milk gelato flavour, inspired by the sweet, starchy milk Americans are fond of adding to their breakfast bowls. Then there is the unusual pancakes and maple syrup flavour, as well as toast with whipped butter. For . those on a diet, frozen yoghurt with granola may be the ideal option, and for those nursing a hangover, there . are few more bracing starts to the day than a Bloody Mary gelato. The cocktail is re-imagined as an ice cool tomato sorbet, spiked . with Tabasco and a heady hit of Worcestershire Sauce. And who . said the morning’s caffeine fix had to be in a tiny cup? Customers can . put some rocket fuel into their day with a rich coffee ice cream, the double espresso gelato. Quirky: On offer is the intriguing toast and whipped butter flavour, left, and the more healthy classic granola and fruit option, right . Depending on the recipe and the person making it, dairy-based gelato contains around 16-24 per cent sugar and 100g of the sugary treat packs around 216 calories. However, while the breakfast ice cream may not aid dieters, it is said to help cure hangovers. Refreshing: Another option is the £3 scoop of Bloody Mary gelato, said to help cure a hangover . The cold effect causes more blood to be sent to the brain as a defence mechanism to try to keep the brain warm. The increased circulation is said to help your brain recover from the dreaded booze-fuelled night before. Also on offer for £3 a scoop at Comboco are other eccentric varieties such as the rich avocado, pear and gorgonzola, the mind-boggling scrambled eggs and, for those with more expensive taste, the . opulent truffle oil and mushroom gelato, alongside more traditional . flavours, such as bronte pistachio, kentish strawberry and Madagascan vanilla.

"World Cup wining defender Mats Hummels has dealt Manchester United a blow in their attempt to sign him by insisting he is happy at Borussia Dortmund. Louis van Gaal is thought to be interested in signing the centre back as he looks to patch up his leaky defence in the January transfer window. But the Germany World Cup winner said although he saw the interest as a compliment, and accepted that he could earn more money with a move away from Dortmund, he has no intention of leaving the club. Mats Hummels challenges Klaas Jan Huntelaar as Borussia Dortmund lost for the third time this season . 'It's nice to hear that big clubs like that are interested in you,' Hummels told Bundesliga Magazine International. 'I take that as a compliment. 'But it doesn't influence me in any way, otherwise. We earn enough here in Dortmund. 'There will always be someone who can pay more than BVB. But Dortmund have made a lot of progress in my time here. 'In any case, I believe that's enough for me. If one day I start thinking about playing abroad, money won't be the reason. 'But I don't even think about that at the moment. We still have so much further to go here.' The Germany defender says he owes his development to Dortmund and doesn't want to leave . Hummels played a big part in Germany's World Cup success, scoring against France in the quarter-finals . Hummels has been at Dortmund since 2008, winning the Bundesliga twice as well as helping Jurgen Klopp's side reach the Champions League final in 2013. And the Germany defender insisted that the club's stature as one of the smaller outfits among Europe's elite makes the successes all the more satisfying. 'I've been here for six and a half years and it's simply more exciting and more difficult to win trophies as an underdog. 'Everybody can win things with 25 superstars in the squad. At BVB, every single player has more responsibility but also more opportunity. 'It's difficult to win trophies with Dortmund but it's always possible. And when it happens, the feeling is simply indescribable.'

And, he says barring any major national disasters, we could soon have huge habitats floating around the planet by the end of the century. Dr Al Globus, a contractor for the Nasa Ames Research Centre in California, says humanity could soon begin to build space settlements. A space settlement (artist's illustration) would be a large structure like a town or city that would house hundreds or thousands of people . Dr Globus is a contract scientist at Nasa Ames research centre and over the years has worked on the Hubble Space Telescope, the ISS, the Space Shuttle and much more. But a few decades ago his interest was piqued by the possibility of space settlements, leading to him setting up Nasa's annual Space Settlement Contest, which challenges students to come up with designs for space colonies. Now he’s a major proponent for living in space, and believes that it won’t be long before people are visiting cities in Earth orbit as readily as they travel from London to New York. A space settlement would be a large structure, comparable in size to a town or small city, built in Earth orbit. It would have similar amenities and services to towns and cities on Earth, and would enable people to live in space. The ISS currently houses six astronauts at a time, but a space settlement would have hundreds or thousands of people on board. Future space settlements may also have artificial gravity by rotating around an axis. ‘Whether [space settlements] will happen or not is really hard to say. Whether it can happen, absolutely,’ Dr Globus tells MailOnline. ‘If we as a people decide to do it, we can do it. We have the scientific capability, financial capability, there is simply no question we can do it. ‘If no major disaster strikes in the next few centuries, I would be astounded if we didn’t do it.’ He explains how our technological know-how it only going to increase barring an enormous catastrophe like a nuclear war. ‘We could have the first space settlement in decades, certainly less than a century.’ Dr Globus (pictured) is a contract scientist at Nasa Ames research centre and over the years has worked on the Hubble Space Telescope, the ISS, the Space Shuttle and much more. He now also runs an annual competition called the Space Settlement Contest . Dr Globus is a proponent of orbiting colonies, while he adds that others like SpaceX CEO Elon Musk are envisaging a future where humans live on Mars. As to the actual purpose of a space settlement Dr Globus says it could be just like a town or city on Earth while also providing a way for humans to expand and survive off Earth. It would be ‘a place to live, raise your kids, where your friends and family have Thanksgiving dinner and celebrate Christmas, and visit Earth on vacation,’ explains Dr Globus. ‘It’s the same purpose as any town or settlement or city has. ‘The way species get endangered and wiped out is by being dependent on a limited environment. ‘Humanity started in East Africa and now live on literally every continent - even Antarctica - albeit for a small time. ‘We live in snow, jungle, deserts, savannahas, forests; we have spread out about as far as we can spread out, and the next step is to move to space.’ SpaceX CEO Elon Musk (left) has been building and launching rockets with the goal of making access to space easier. He hopes that one day humans may be able to colonise Mars (right). Dr Globus says such a goal is achievable, after perhaps building a colony in Earth orbit . But what would that first space settlement look like? Many designs rely upon a central cylinder around which is a rotating habitat. In the rotating section the force of rotation provides artificial gravity for the inhabitants, letting the move around like they would on Earth. ‘That means your children will grow up with strong muscles,’ explains Dr Globus, so even if they spend a prolonged time in space they could still travel to Earth and cope with its gravity. At the centre of the structure though there would be zero-gravity, as there would be no rotation here. This, explains Dr Globus, could be used for recreation or even to film movies. Elsewhere on the station would be agriculture, while the outer hull would need to be partially covered in solar cells. But what would that first space settlement look like? Many designs rely upon a central cylinder around which is a rotating habitat (artist's illustration shown). In the rotating section the force of rotation provides artificial gravity for the inhabitants, letting the move around like they would on Earth . But Dr Globus admits that such an undertaking is something that just isn’t financially feasible - for now. According to Dr Globus there are a number of obstacles that must be overcome before humans can live in space. The first is that the cost of getting to space via rockets must decrease. Next is life support; a future space colony will need to be almost self-sufficient, using indoor farms and solar energy. A colony will also need radiation shielding to protect it from harmful cosmic and solar rays, although recent research says this may not be a big issue. ‘If you have to ask [how much it would cost], you can’t afford it,’ he jokes. He adds: ‘There is one circumstance we could easily afford it, and that’s if the people of Earth decided to stop killing each other and spend all that time and money on space settlements.’ However starting to build a space settlement now is not a good idea, he says, as technology and infrastructure are not yet sufficient. He says we need to progress through several hoops before settling in space can become a viable option. One of these is space tourism. Several private companies such as Boeing and SpaceX are busy building manned spacecraft, while others like Bigelow Aerospace are planning to build ‘space hotels’ in orbit. These orbiting habitats, while much smaller than the large space settlements envisaged by Dr Globus, would allow people to pay for trips to space. Dr Globus even says these could be used to raise money by hosting what he calls a ‘Space Olympics’ in orbit. By sending the world’s top athletes to space and having the compete, people would tune in to watch them compete in a variety of micro-gravity sports. ‘You could get Usain Bolt, a soccer star, a basketball star and so on,’ he says. ‘It would be a level playing field because no one knows how to do sports in microgravity. So that would totally be entertaining.’ Dr Globus says we need to progress through several hoops before settling in space can really be a viable option. One of these is space tourism. Several private companies such as Boeing and SpaceX are busy building manned spacecraft, while others like Bigelow Aerospace are planning to build ‘space hotels’ (concepts shown) The timeline for all this is of course up for debate, but Dr Globus is confident it will happen sooner or later. ‘In two or three decades we might have a couple of small hotels [in orbit], and people moving in on a regular basis,’ he says. ‘Then at some point somebody will notice if you are old and infirm you might like to live on a space hotel, because you wouldn’t be subjected to a 1G hotel and you wouldn’t need a walker or wheelchair. ‘I can foresee someone building a retirement home in low gravity; after a couple of years you won’t be able to come back, but if you’re facing 15 years of sitting in a wheelchair you might not want to do that anyway. ‘And once that step is done, people living in space permanently, then it’s not a big step to build a space settlement in orbit. ‘All that is on a time scale measured in decades, or in the worst case centuries.’ And living in space doesn’t need to stop there. Once a large, floating colony has been built, Dr Globus explains that other locations in the solar system can be explored. Perhaps, using asteroids for additional material, a space settlement could be placed around the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos. Once humans have settled in Earth orbit, Dr Globus says it is not a huge leap to imagine they will want to eventually travel further. This could begin with the solar system in a few millennia and, ultimately, expand further into the Milky Way . ‘I can imagine within a few centuries that the first settlement will be co-orbiting an asteroid,’ says Dr Globus. ‘To really settle the solar system will take millennia, maybe longer.’ And once that goal has achieved, Dr Globus says there is not much to stop us expanding into the rest of galaxy. ‘Imagine you have been living on orbital space settlements for 10,000 years,’ he says. ‘In your settlement there might be 100,000 people or even millions. ‘If people decided to go to Alpha Centauri, even thought it may take a century to get there, it doesn’t matter, because you’ve been living in this settlement for thousands of years anyway. ‘In terms of living situations, does it really matter if you circle Earth or Alpha Centauri? Not really.’","Dr Al Globus, a contractor for the Nasa Ames Research Centre in California, says humanity could soon begin to build space settlements .

"After more than a week of speculation, North Korea has finally admitted its 'Dear Leader' is poorly - sparking new rumours he may have  gout. Kim Jong-un, whose weight has ballooned in recent months thanks in part to an addiction to Swiss cheese, has been struck down by a mystery illness, his henchmen in Pyongyang revealed today, saying only that he was 'suffering from discomfort'. It comes after the 31-year-old vanished from his usual role as centrepiece to the isolated country's propaganda machine after last appearing in public at a concert with his wife on September 3, fuelling speculation he is suffering from bad health. He had been seen walking with a limp since an event with key officials in July and in a pre-recorded documentary broadcast by state media on Thursday appeared to have difficulty walking. Scroll down for video . Unwell? Kim, 31, who is frequently the centrepiece of the isolated country's propaganda, has not been photographed by state media since September 3, fuelling speculation he is unwell. He has also been seen walking with a limp . 'The wealth and prosperity of our socialism is thanks to the painstaking efforts of our marshal, who keeps lighting the path for the people, like the flicker of a flame, despite suffering discomfort,' a voice over for the hour-long documentary said. The documentary was followed by a pre-recorded broadcast of a North Korean Supreme People's Assembly meeting from which Kim Jong Un was notably absent. Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show. North Korea observers speculate Kim's weight and family background may have contributed to his condition. Now and then: Kim has rapidly gained weight since coming to power (right) after his father died of a heart attack in 2011, photos released by state media show . 'Disease of Kings': Historically known as 'the disease of kings', with Henry VIII a known sufferer, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle . 'Based on his gait, it appears he has gout - something (due to) diet and genetic predisposition that has affected other members of the Kim family,' said Michael Madden, an expert on the North Korean leadership and contributor to the 38 North website. Historically known as 'the disease of kings', with Henry VIII a known sufferer, gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis which has long been thought to be caused by an overindulgent lifestyle. The condition used to be rare among young people, but research suggests it is becoming more common with the obese getting it a decade earlier than healthy weight people. Men are more likely to develop gout than women because their uric acid levels rise during puberty and remain higher than women through adulthood. It usually first appears between the ages of 30 to 60 and becomes more common with age. The condition is characterised by sudden onset of acute pain, redness and swelling in the joints such as the big toe. Gout is caused by a build-up of uric acid in the blood. Uric acid is a waste product that forms when the body breaks down chemicals in the cells known as purines. If you produce too much uric acid or excrete too little when you urinate, the uric acid will build up and may cause needle-like crystals in and around the joints, most commonly in the foot (particularly the big toe), but also the knees, fingers, forearms and elbows. The crystals may spill over from the joint cartilage into the joint space, causing a painful attack. Foods naturally high in purines include red meat – such as beef, lamb and pork - seafood, especially shellfish and oily fish, and offal. 'It is protein-rich foods that cause gout,' dietitian Helen Bond told MailOnline. 'Cheese is not a high risk food, although eating a lot of it will mean he is likely to have high calcium – and cholesterol – levels.' Other risk factors include obesity - partly because of extra pressure on the joints and chemical changes as a result of the fat - and heavy alcohol consumption, particularly beer, which is high in purines, and spirits. Smoking is not generally seen as a risk factor for gout. The 31-year-old North Korean leader got a taste for Swiss cheese while a student in Switzerland - and is understood to love it so much that he imports vast quantities, despite Western sanctions. A unhealthy appetite for Emmental, also known as Swiss cheese, is believed to be a key factor in Kim's weight ballooning so much in recent months that he now walks with a limp. Experts believe Kim may be deliberately gaining weight in order to look more like his grandfather Kim Il-sung, who is venerated in North Korea as the nation's founder and even now - exactly 20 years after his death - is still considered the head of state, with the title Eternal President of the Republic. Kim has not been a presence in state media since attending a Pyongyang concert on September 3. There's been no discussion of the absence in the authoritarian North's media. North Korea's official Korean Central Television says the Supreme People's Assembly approved the promotion of Hwang Pyong So as the vice chairman of the country's powerful National Defense Commission. Kim Jong-un's unhealthy obsession with Emmental has led to him importing vast quantities of the cheese for his own consumption - despite millions of North Koreans struggling to find enough to eat. Malnutrition is widespread and famines often break out in the country, which is still reliant on foreign food aid as a result of economic mismanagement and the loss of Soviet support in the 1990s. But despite the suffering of his 25 million citizens, Kim continues to gorge on Swiss cheese in such vast quantities that he is waistline is expanding at a dangerously rapid rate, according to the Mirror. North Koreans who have managed to flee the country believe the weight gain may be deliberate in order to look more like his corpulent late grandfather Kim Il-sung. He established an all-pervasive cult of personality around himself after turning North Korea into a oppressive single-party socialist state in the early 1980s. Defector Cho Myung-Chul, of the Saenuri Party, said: 'North Koreans think being fat is good, unlike South Koreans who want to be skinny. 'There is a high chance Jong-un intentionally gained weight to look like Il-sung.'","Kim Jong-un has not been photographed in public since September 3 .

"One of only four American doctors who perform third-trimester abortions has added to the increasing controversy of her procedures by  speaking out to defend the practice and revealing she encourages mothers to 'hold' their babies after the operation and create a 'memory box' of photos and footprints. Late-term abortionist Dr Susan Robinson - who is at the forefront of new documentary After Tiller, about the small group of professionals who fight to keep late abortion available - has defended her practices, saying that 'honoring' the baby can be a necessary part for the parents accepting their decision. 'With a fetal indications patient—if she refers to it as her baby, I'll refer to it as her baby. If she’s named the baby, I’ll use the baby’s name too,' Dr Robinson said in an interview with The Hairpin. Dr. Susan Robinson, who is at the center of new late-term abortion documentary After Tiller, has defended the controversial practice of inviting mothers to hold their babies and create a 'memory box' of photos and footprints, saying it is important for parents to find closure. Many of the procedures are undertaken because of fetal abnormalities that are only detected in the latter stages of pregnancy . 'I would say that most of these patients do decide to see and hold their baby, although many of them have a hard time dealing with the idea at first. 'We’ll take remembrance photographs, we’ll give them a teddy bear, the footprints. I mean, imagine being six months pregnant and finding out your baby’s missing half its brain, and you’ve got this nursery you’ve painted at home, you’re so ready - I don’t want them to go home from the procedure with absolutely nothing to remember and honor the baby, and its birth.' Dr Robinson and the three other doctors who perform late-term abortions - which take place after the 20th week of gestation - face incredible danger and scrutiny for the work they do, especially following the assassination of their colleague Dr George Tiller, who was shot by an anti-abortion activist as he attended church in May 2009. Dr George Tiller was shot through the head and killed in May 2009 by anti-abortionist Scott Roeder as he attended church in Kansas. A new documentary, After Tiller, which opened in New York last week, follows the fight of the four remaining doctors in the United States to carry onTiller's work and perform late term abortions, or abortions performed after the 20th week of gestation. Tiller was also shot in 1993 in Wichita but survived (pictured left) Late-term abortions are illegal in all-but nine US states and fewer than 1 per cent of abortions are performed in the third trimester. The procedure itself, according to Dr Robinson, can take up to four days and is 'very disagreeable' with the body. A 2011 Gallup poll found only 10 per cent of Americans are in favor of the practice, with many believing it is murder and 'infanticide'. Some 79 per cent of pro choice advocates said abortions in the third trimester should be illegal. However Dr Robinson, who has been performing abortions exclusively for 13 years, said such beliefs were steeped in misconception and misinformation. 'I think that the public perceives first of all that late abortion could be completely eliminated if people would only get their act together and have their abortions earlier, which is completely untrue,' she told The Hairpin. Last of their kind: Doctors LeRoy Carhart, Warren Hern, Susan Robinson and Shelley Sella at the premier of After Tiller at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival. They are the only doctors in America who perform late-term abortions and are forced to deal with endless protests, threats of violence, shot-out windows, and efforts to pass laws making it impossible for them to do their jobs . 'I also think that people assume that women do this casually—that they've known they were pregnant for thirty weeks and then were on their way down to the hair salon and they saw the abortion clinic and they decided to just walk in to avoid the inconveniences of motherhood. 'That also is completely untrue. No matter how available birth control and first-trimester and second-trimester abortion is, you are always going to have the need for later abortions. A woman would never do this casually. The procedure lasts three or four days, and is fairly disagreeable.' Dr Robinson said the time in which the operation can be performed depends on the mother and the health of her baby. Coming out: Dr Shelley Sella was initially reluctant to participate in any interview because Dr Tiller never gave any, saying his reason was that it was about the patient and not him . 'If someone finds out about a significant fetal anomaly that's bad enough that they want to terminate the pregnancy, then I believe that's their discretion,' she told The Hairpin. 'Some feel like, ""Sure, I can take care of a kid with Down's no problem"", and then two months later they're told that the baby also has an irreparable cardiac defect. 'They're told that the baby will have to have a dozen surgeries in its first year, with a very small chance that it will live past a certain age. And in those cases I see it as the parents' discretion, if they think their child's life will be filled with too much pain and suffering. 'There's a disabled-rights side to this ... When parents are saying ""We do not feel we can adequately cope with that issue"", I believe them, and I don't think they'd have an easy time putting a child with severe disabilities up for adoption successfully.'' Dr Robinson also maintained a late-term abortion is no more dangerous than child birth. 'Not often, but things go wrong when you do abortions,' she said. 'They don't usually go seriously wrong, but it’s a complex procedure. Still, if you compare abortion at any gestational age to childbirth, childbirth is significantly more likely to kill the mother than abortion, which is something that no OB-GYN (doctor) will ever tell you.'","Doctor says public are misinformed about the importance of late-term abortion .

"Even in a community shaken to its core by tragedy, nothing can stop Christmas. More than a week after the mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, that claimed 26 lives - 20 of them children - the anguished community is trying to keep the holiday tradition alive. The St Rose of Lima Church - the center of mourning since the December 14 shooting - will still hold its annual Christmas pageant, in which two of the tragic children were to star. Angel: Olivia Engel, pictured in a recent photo at left and while wearing angel's wings at right, was supposed to be in today's Christmas pageant before her life was tragically cut short . One of the slain children, six-year-old Olivia Engel, was to play an angel in the performance. Another child, who was no immediately identified, was due to play a shepherd. The church's Monsignor Bob Weiss told the New York Post that the 4pm pageant at Newtown High School will go on today as scheduled, but as if the children were still there. He told the paper: 'The pageant is dedicated to all the kids who were taken from us,' he said. 'These are little children who loved Christmas.' He admitted that the plans to continue the tradition have been difficult, but said the holiday spirit is important in helping the town heal. Msgr Weiss told the Post: 'I was thinking about that this morning - ""You need a little Christmas"" - trying to get myself going,' he said. 'We all need a little Christmas.' Residents across Newtown, meanwhile, were seeking to move forward through faith, community and a determination to seize their future. Many have taken advantage of counseling services.

'You find yourself not sure what to do or what to say, so this kind of helps.' Connor Collier, 21, of Newtown, said visitors earlier in the week were mostly with the media. But that changed during the weekend to 'just regular people' from as far away as Washington State and Florida. 'Frankly, I like this a lot better. Everybody wants to help,' said Collier, who has spent the past week near . the village Christmas tree selling green and white bracelets that read, . 'Angels of Sandy Hook.'

She choked up as she read the names of the victims and offered a prayer for all of them, including gunman Adam Lanza and his mother Nancy - his first shooting victim. Msgr Weiss thanked the community for giving him strength to get through a week filled with funerals. St Rose of Lima lost eight children and two adults in the massacre. 'This has been the worst week of my life,' Weiss said. Deacon Rick Scinto of St Rose of Lima said church officials will be teamed with professional counselors and therapists to provide assistance. 'I don't see us taking a lead role, but I certainly see us taking a cooperative role in any kind of counseling that they need. We have our niche. We're religious and we can talk about God and how the Lord figures in this whole mess,' Scinto said. To deal with the short-term trauma, the state sent dozens of mental health professionals to Newtown. Sessions were available every day, at a half-dozen locations. Relief also has been provided by therapy and service dogs, massage therapists, acupuncturists and art therapists, from around Connecticut and the nation. Dennis Stratford, who works for the school district, happened to be making a delivery to Sandy Hook Elementary when the gunman attacked. He saw dead children. He saw the remains of dead children on those who survived. He waited agonizing minutes for his own child to emerge unharmed from the school. Two of his neighbors' children did not. 'I go home and cry every night, and I cry every morning,' Stratford said. He went to one counseling session, but the horrific images remain. What helps more is work: sorting through the warehouses full of gifts, delivering them where they need to go or doing whatever else needs to be done for his town.

"Sportsmail asked Manchester United blog Stretty News about the dilemma facing Louis van Gaal as he mulls over who to appoint as his captain to replace the departed Nemanja Vidic. Shortly after the exit of Nemanja Vidic came the arrival of new manager Louis van Gaal. The Serbian’s departure sparked a debate over who will become club captain, but the Dutchman is adamant that he will not rush the awaited decision. Van Gaal speaks regularly on how . important deciding a captain is for his side. He looks for players with . similar outlooks to himself on life and, of course, football philosophy. While leading Holland to a World Cup semi-final, he named Robin van . Persie captain, which reveals the pre-existing trust within their . working relationship, thereby making the striker a prominent . front-runner for the United job. VIDEO Scroll dwon to watch Louis van Gaal closely supervising Man United training . Decision time: Louis van Gaal will name his Manchester United captain before the start of the season . 'For me, it [is] always very important, the choice of the captain, because he is the captain on the pitch, and he can enlarge my influence,' Van Gaal told Sky Sports. 'He more or less needs to have the same philosophy and the way of seeing life. That [person] is not so simple to choose, so I need time to do that.' This summer alone, Manchester United have lost four players that have previously served as captain: Nemanja Vidic, Rio Ferdinand, Patrice Evra, and Ryan Giggs. Each one’s leadership was significant in the dressing room, and will be missed. At the  least, Giggs is still present as assistant manager. In the current squad, Wayne Rooney has most frequently worn the captain’s armband, but, being unfamiliar to Van Gaal, is not a definite shout for the role. At the moment, four players are in contention for captaincy. They are as follows, in no particular order: . Farewell: Nemanja Vidic applauds the Old Trafford crowd for the final time after United beat Sunderland in May . Robin van Persie . Van Persie played six matches (548 minutes in total) at the World Cup, scoring four goals. Yet, Van Gaal was not afraid to substitute his main man up top when they were in search of a goal. Klaas-Jan Huntelaar was the usual replacement, and the Schalke man rewarded his boss with a key goal and an assist in three energetic appearances. The argument against making Van Persie captain would be his well-publicised clashes with David Moyes, last season. Time may have borne out many of his opinions, but issues within the club should stay there, rather that be aired out in the press. The new manager’s previous relationship with the player, however, makes any repeat episodes highly unlikely. It was no secret that Van Persie struggled to get on with Moyes and was tempted on more than one occasion to leave the club. Sir Alex Ferguson had promised to be there the for three seasons of Van Persie's contract but now when he looks at it, things could not have worked out better. Ducth delight: Van Gaal and Van Persie celebrate after the Holland captain's wonder goal vs Spain . Wayne Rooney . Having deputised for others on several occasions, serving as the de facto captain would be a role that Wayne Rooney would relish. Approached with the proper attitude the responsibility could carry him to the next level in his development as a player, building confidence within him, and transforming what has become a tarnished image without. Earning the new manager’s trust, and leading United back into the Premier League title race would also bolster his credentials for the recently-vacated England captaincy. Rooney's previous contract maneuverings, with rumours that he was pushing for a move to City in 2010, and Chelsea last summer, are the same type of dissension in which Van Persie engaged with Moyes. There are also the troubles with his fitness and accusations regarding an off-season regimen erring on the side of light. Van Gaal surely knows about these issues, and will wish to see nothing less than a full commitment to training, and to the club, before he is willing to trust the face of Manchester United with its future. Such a commitment, however, will have supporters looking eagerly towards his ascension up the venerated club's all-time goal-scoring list, on which his 216 trail only Denis Law's 237 and Sir Bobby Charlton's 249. It is said that Moyes had intended to hand the captaincy to Rooney this season, with Nemanja Vidic's retirement to San Siro completed, but, at this point, the United universe is past caring the least what Moyes' plans were. For his own betterment, Rooney should be, as well. He's behind you: Van Gaal keeps a close eye on Rooney during training in LA last month . Jonny Evans . The Northern Ireland centre half has endured a couple of rough patches at Manchester United since he broke into the first team. Evans was often offered up as the sacrificial lamb after poor results, regardless of the self-evidence of his ability and potential. It has become all too familiar for United to have a wrongly acclaimed scapegoat down the years. Like Michael Carrick, Jonny Evans has been successful in terms of proving many doubters wrong, but to this day others remain none the wiser. In fact, of the club’s current defenders, he is arguably the best. Both Chris Smalling and Phil Jones have some work to do. In regards to captaincy, Evans is a personal favourite for the role. The 26-year-old already has already displayed leadership. Many will argue that he remains a work in progress, but if the time is not now, do not be surprised if it arrives soon. Following loan spells at Royal Antwerp and Sunderland, the centre back returned to Old Trafford with vast improvements and it was only a matter of time before Sir Alex Ferguson made use of that. Van Gaal has an eye for talent, and surely will, as well. Good Evans: The centre back has been something of an unsung hero over the last few years . Darren Fletcher . What a U-turn Darren Fletcher has made with his football career. A year or so ago, everyone, including Sir Alex Ferguson, doubted whether he would play again after a difficult battle with an intestinal disease. The Scot has slowly but surely returned, but uncertainty over the permanence of his recovery, and his match fitness, place him on the perimeter of the squad. He seems a newcomer rather than an old veteran. I suspect that Gordon Strachan’s captain with the Scottish national team will have to do more than even Rooney to earn the armband from Van Gaal. Experienced: Fletcher, 30, made his Manchester United debut in the 2002-03 season . Michael Carrick (n/a) Unfortunately, Michael Carrick’s serious ankle injury, suffered prior to the pre-season tour, has put him on the shelf for three months. It goes without saying that the knock completely rules him out of the this race for captaincy. In terms of leadership, Carrick let himself down last season. He was one of the players expected to pull his weight when United’s backs were against the wall. Saying that, it was a season the club need to write off, and, had he not been injured, Carrick would have deserved the same clean slate now being given to Van Persie. The quicker United get Carrick back into the fold the better. Maybe not as captain, mind. Out of the running: Carrick (centre) will miss a large chunk of the season with an ankle injury . Louis van Gaal has come into the job late, but with no preconceptions, and no sense of urgency. Every player in the squad is being given the opportunity to impress. The Dutchman will continue to observe his squad for the remainder of this US tour, searching for the perfect blend of youth, talent, athleticism, experience, and leadership. He is more patient with the process than United supporters who have just endured the worst season in living memory. When he is ready, he will name his squad, and captain. Until then, all the rest of us can do is guess.","Man United captaincy vacant after Nemanja Vidic left to join Inter Milan .

Last week, Robert King, the U.S. special envoy for North Korean human rights issues, said Pyongyang has not accepted American offers to send a high-level envoy to seek release of the three men.

"Conflict: Roger Waters, 70, has been branded an antisemitic after his comments last week . The former frontman of Pink Floyd has sparked outrage after comparing Israel's government to the Nazi regime. Leading rabbis and Jewish writers have blasted Roger Waters as antisemitic for claiming the state's treatment of Palestinians is akin to the oppression of Jews between 1933 and 1946. Waters, 70, who refuses to visit or perform in Israel, said he would not have played in France or Germany during the Second World War either. 'The parallels with what went on in the 1930s in Germany are so crushingly obvious,' he told American magazine Counter Punch last week. 'There were many people that pretended that the oppression of the Jews was not going on. From 1933 until 1946. So this is not a new scenario. Except that this time, it's the Palestinian people being murdered.' He claimed Palestinians are regarded as 'sub-human', and branded the Israeli rabbinate 'bizarre'. Enraged, Rabbi Shmuley Boteach has hit back at Waters, calling his comments an 'antisemitic diatribe' which outstretches any other attack on Israel and Jews. Writing in the New York Observer, Rabbi Boteach said: 'Mr Waters, the Nazis were a genocidal regime that murdered six million Jews. 'That you would have the audacity to compare Jews to monsters who murdered them shows you have no decency, you have no heart, you have no soul.' The conflict comes just months after Waters was forced to explain why he used a pig-shaped balloon decorated with a Star of David on the set of one of his concerts, seen by many to single out Judaism as an evil force. The singer, a vocal supporter of the Palestinian cause, rebuffed his critics by claiming it was one of many religious symbols on the stage. Last night, Waters rejected his critics once again. It follows outrage earlier this year when a pig balloon marked with a Star of David formed part of Waters' set at a concert. Waters rejected claims it was a message to fans that Judaism is a force of evil . Speaking in New York, he said: ‘I do not know Rabbi Boteach, and am not prepared to get into a slanging match with him. I will say this: I have nothing against Jews or Israelis, and I am not antisemitic. ‘I deplore the policies of the Israeli government in the occupied territories and Gaza. They are immoral, inhuman and illegal. I will continue my non-violent protests as long as the government of Israel continues with these policies.’ Karen Pollock, chief executive of the Holocaust Educational Trust, said everyone was ‘entitled to an opinion and to advocate passionately for a cause’. But she added: ‘Drawing inappropriate parallels with the Holocaust insults the memory of the six million Jews – men, women and children – murdered by the Nazis. 'These kinds of attacks are commonly used as veiled antisemitism and should be exposed as such.’","Bassist, 70, said treatment of Palestinians is same as the oppression of Jews during World War Two adding that they are treated as 'sub-human'

"A former Nazi concentration camp guard known only as Horst P keeps a photo scrapbook of his time at Dachau and says he had 'fun' there . Authorities in Germany have opened a probe into a Nazi concentration camp S.S. guard who kept a photo scrapbook of his time at Dachau where he admitted he 'had fun.' Identified only as Horst P., now aged 87, he was a guard at the camp outside Munich between 1943 and the end of the war. Dachau was the first of the Nazi concentration camps, the blueprint for brutality at all other such places in the Third Reich and some 36,000 people were murdered there between 1933 and 1945. Horst P., who lives in Berlin, was reported to the local prosecutor by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre in Israel as a probable war criminal after receiving information about him from camp survivors. He lives in the Gruenau section of Berlin with a female partner 14 years younger than him and has a photo collage of himself in an S.S. uniform in Dachau. Over the photos are inscribed the words 'Mein Kampf' - meaning My Struggle, the title of his one time Fuehrer Adolf Hitler's rabid anti-Semitic autobiography. He told the Bild newspaper in Germany: 'Yes, I wanted to go into the S.S.  It was explained to me that it would be fun.' Bild commented: 'When he talks about his time in Dachau, it sounded like it was.' Horst P. went on: 'We were together with the prisoners each day. They were like colleagues. With some I even played cards. I ate the same things. There was even a certain camaraderie.' But he says nothing about extermination or murder, or the hideous medical experiments carried out on prisoners by air force doctors who wanted to test the human body's reaction to freezing water in a bid to save downed pilots in the English Channel during the Battle of Britain. He only added unrepentantly: 'If a . criminal made trouble I reported him.  Then he was taken away and went . into the special prison.  Sometimes I never saw him again.  But I never . asked questions because I didn't want it to appear that I had something . to do with them.' Horst was overseer of the camp for almost two years between 1943 and 1947. Dachau was the first concentration camp, and the horrors carried out there helped to create a blueprint for all future camps . He added: 'If one was so stupid not to obey, then you can no longer help him. I did not want to help them. I wanted to live.' It is understood that eyewitnesses have placed him at beatings and executions in Dachau. A whipping stool, where prisoners were often flogged to death, is one of the exhibits still on display in the camp to this day. Between 1933 and 1945, more than 200,000 people from 38 countries were held at Dachau and at least 30,000 people were killed, starved or died of disease.

"Peter Lanza, the father of Sandy Hook shooter, hadn't spoken to his son for more than two years and his father is at a loss for what drove Adam to kill 20 students and six teachers at his old elementary school. A family friend told The Wall Street Journal that father Peter Lanza 'is as clueless as everybody' as to what cause the boy to snap. Adam, 20, had not spoken to his brother Ryan or father for upwards of two years at the time of the shooting. Adam reportedly distanced himself from his father Peter when he started to become serious with his new girlfriend, and current wife. Peter and Adam's mother Nancy split in 2001 but did not formally divorce until November 2008. Court records made the split appear amicable as both parties agreed to put their sons needs above any bitterness, but Adam was apparently the one to cut ties with his father in 2010. Trouble brewing: A new report claims that Adam Lanza cut off ties with his father Peter (left) when he began seriously dating his then-girlfriend and current wife Shelley Cudiner (right) in 2010 . New life: Peter Lanza stopped visiting his son Adam in 2010 when he began living in this Stamford house . For the first nine years following the split, Peter visited Adam and Ryan at their mother's home in Newtown from his new house in Stamford, 45 minutes away. The Wall Street Journal reports that Adam cut ties from his father in 2010, right about the time that Peter began living with Shelley Cudiner. Peter has been living with Cudiner in Stamford for about three years and they married last year. Overwhelmed with grief: Newtown, Connecticut has finally laid the last victim to rest but the town continues to grieve as this woman looks for a place to lay her flowers . Remembering the victims: Many of the memorials have included crosses for the Christian victims and Stars of David for the one Jewish victim, Noah Posner . A sign hangs in Newtown, Connecticut thanking first responders of the Sandy Hook shootings . Paying tribute: A couple looks on at one of the many memorials set up throughout Newtown . News of the inner-workings of the Lanza . family comes on the same day that they released a statement saying that a . hoaxer pretended to be Ryan Lanza, Adam's 24-year-old brother and . conducted an interview with The New York Post. The Post conducted the interview over . Facebook chat with an account claiming to be the brother of the dead . shooter. A number of quotes given to the paper included grammatical . mistakes and spelling errors. In the chat, the hoaxer said that 'I am a victim...I loss [sic] my mom and brother.' The . so-called Ryan Lanza posted two photos on Facebook over the weekend, . one of his brother Adam and one of his mother Nancy- who was the first . victim in the shooting spree- with emotional messages in the captions. 'I will miss you bro. I will always love you as long as I live,' he wrote under a picture of a then-teenaged Adam. A . similar sentiment went out to his mother, for whom he said 'I miss you . mom. I love you so much. You will always be in my heart.' Though . this incident seemed unusual given it was the first time Ryan formally . spoke with a reporter, it was not the first time that he took to . Facebook to speak out about the case. On the day of the shooting, Ryan initially posted denials of his involvement on Facebook. Relations were not much better between . Adam and his older brother Ryan, 24, as the paper revealed that the two . brothers had not spoken since after Christmas in 2010. At that time, . Ryan moved away to Manhattan, and though that is not terribly far from . Connecticut, the two siblings do not appear to have been concerned about . staying in touch. Ryan . was initially identified as the shooter in the crazed hours immediately . following the shooting on Friday December 14 when Adam killed his . mother in their Connecticut home and then proceeded to kill 20 young . children, six teachers and himself. Because . Adam had his brother's identification on him at the time of the . shooting, police initially announced that it was Ryan Lanza who was the . murderer. In . reality, Ryan was at work at financial firm Ernst & Young in . Manhattan when television news reports began claiming he was the . shooter. Lanza quickly . told his boss: 'I need to go.' He then walked out of his Times Square . office, according to a co-worker who spoke to MailOnline on condition of . anonymity. Thirty minutes later, New York police officers stormed the office. Between leaving his place of work and being taken in for questioning, Lanza defended himself in a series of bizarre Facebook posts when he was mistakenly named as the killer after his ID was found at the scene. 'Everyone shut the f*** up it wasn't me,' he insisted on his Facebook page on Friday. 'I'm on the bus home now it wasn't me. IT WASN'T ME I WAS AT WORK IT WASN'T ME.' Brett Wilshe, a friend of Ryan . Lanza's, told the AP that he sent Ryan a Facebook message Friday asking . what was going on and if he was alright. According to Wilshe, Lanza's reply was something along the lines of: 'It was my brother. I think my mother is dead. Oh my God.' The . relationship between Ryan and his brother is one that will undoubtedly . come to light as time goes on, but part of the reason why Ryan was ruled . out as a suspect in the shooting was because he has not seen his . brother in over two years. Mourning: A hoaxer pretending to be Ryan Lanza (left) said that he will forever remember his brother Adam (right) who was responsible for 27 deaths and who killed himself during the Sandy Hook shooting . Real words: Immediately after the shooting, MailOnline took a screengrab (pictured above) of Ryan Lanza's Facebook account where he spoke out saying that he had no connection to the actual shooting . Love: The hoaxer claiming to be Ryan said that he loved his mother Nancy, right, who was the first victim of the shooting and was killed in bed at her Newtown home, left . That absence does not seem to have made him any less loyal, however, as he now takes to Facebook to criticize those who criticize his dead brother. For instance, when someone wrote on Ryan's pace that his brother deserved to 'rot in hell' and was the 'scum of the earth', Ryan responded by writing 'I am so tired of people blaming me or something my brother did. I love Adam, hes [sic] my brother.' Ryan continued, saying that the person who commented was a stranger: 'He is calling my brother a monster when he don't [sic] even know him'.","Hoaxer claiming to be Sandy Hook shooter Adam Lanza's brother Ryan gave fake interview to reporter .

'When people are unhappy with one of our honorees, we would hope that they would project their anger in more positive ways than to vandalize a California State landmark,' the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce said in a statement. 'The star is being cleaned up at this time.' Photographs taken on Friday showed workers scrubbing the stone. The incident comes after 20 women, including former super model Janice Dickinson, stepped forward to accuse the comedian of unwanted advances, including drugging and then raping them. In 2005, a Temple University employee accused him of an assault and - although 13 women who claimed they had similar experience were willing to testify in the case - it was settled out of court. Then two months ago, after comedian Hannibal Buress went on a rant about the comedian during a stand-up set, scores of women started coming forward to accuse Cosby of rape. Damage: A vandal scribbled rapist all over the star's Hollywood sign on Thursday, prompting cleaners to scrub the graffiti off . He has most recently been taken to court by a woman, Judy Huth, who claims she was just 15 when Cosby raped her at the Playboy Mansion in 1974. Cosby's lawyers have said she previously tried to extort him and have requested that the case is thrown out, saying the accusations are too old. As the allegations surfaced, NBC dropped a new project with the comedian, while Netflix also shelved a one-off comedy special planned for the day after Thanksgiving. He also resigned from Temple University's board of trustees, which he joined in 1982. Cosby has denied the allegations.","The 68-year-old star of 1970's Roots urged people to 'pray for the people scandalizing' Cosby .

"A North Carolina woman is seeking an apology after staff at a local restaurant told her to cover up while she breastfed her six-month-old son. Karissa Riddle, 22, of Charlotte told the Gaston Gazette that she was in Qdoba Mexican Grill at Gaston Mall Tuesday breastfeeding her son. After she finished, an employee approached her and told her to cover up because the restaurant had received complaints. 'I honestly couldn't believe what I was being asked to do,' Riddle told the Gazette. Apology: Karissa Riddle, 22, of Charlotte is seeking an apology after staff at a local restaurant told her to cover up while she breastfed her six-month-old son . State Law: Riddle told the employee that state law allows her to breastfeed in public, but the employee told her that company policy allowed staff to ask her to cover up . Riddle told the employee that state law allows her to breastfeed in public, but the employee told her that company policy allowed staff to ask her to cover up, FOX News reports. Riddle says she considers herself a modest person and wasn't trying to show off her body at the restaurant. She said she was simply trying to feed her son. The state allows women to breastfeed in any public or private place and exempts breastfeeding from public indecency laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Mike Lari, a Gastonia police captain, told the Gazette there's nothing stopping a woman from walking down the street 'completely bare breasted.' Lari said his department rarely receives complaints from the public about breastfeeding. Riddle hopes to get an apology from restaurant officials, and a Qdoba spokesperson said the incident is being reviewed. 'It’s always in the back of your mind that somebody will say something,' Riddle told the Gazette. 'It’s just a slap back to reality, that we still sexualize breasts. 'It made me ashamed to be a woman.' The Qdoba Mexican Grill has received backlash on its Facebook page. Some have even made erroneous claims that the restaurant called the police on the woman.

"An extraordinary collection of propaganda posters from the Second World War reveals how the authorities aimed to convince the public that Britain was bound to defeat the Nazis. The historic artworks blare out the message that 'victory of the Allies is assured' - but still urged Britons to hoard their kitchen waste for farm animals and keep a sharp eye out for foreign spies. The rousing posters, some of which are written in French and Portuguese, are being sold at auction later this month and are expected to fetch around £7,000. Mixed messages: Some propaganda from the Second World War emphasised the strength of the Allies, but others urged Britons to remain thrifty . Warning: One series of posters shows Britons chatting about the war overheard by nefarious characters, and a deadly results of 'careless talk' Multi-lingual: Most of the posters are aimed at the British themselves, but others aim to reach allies by using foreign languages such as Catalan, right . They show fictional scenes such as Allied tanks destroying their Nazi opponents, marine commandos storming an occupied village and RAF bombers striking German factories. Others feature the capture of a German U-Boat and a British navy cruiser ramming an Italian submarine. A series of posters aimed at the UK's French allies, many of whom had little idea about the progress of the war, says: 'The fall of the dictators is assured'. British citizens were urged to save scraps of food to feed to chickens, and set up clubs to breed pigs. And chilling images from the famous 'careless talk costs lives' campaign dramatise the deadly consequences of being overheard discussing war plans. Quirky: These posters urge thrifty householders to recycle their kitchen scraps so they could be fed to pigs which would then be slaughtered . Boast: Many of the posters are aimed at convincing Allied citizens that their armies were much stronger than the Axis posters . Attractive: Some of the well-designed posters appeal for help for the Merchant Navy, which was vital in maintaining Allied supply lines . Moral support: Some of the posters produced by the Ministry of Information urge members of the public to show their support for the troops . Some of the posters have come from an archive belonging to Edwin Embleton, head of the Ministry of Information department responsible for producing the patriotic artwork. The collection of around 30 posters is going under the hammer at Onslows Auctioneers in Blandford, Dorset on December 20. Auctioneer Patrick Bogue said: 'These propaganda posters are a fascinating reminder of the lengths the Ministry of Information went to to boost moral among troops and civilians. 'They are cartoon-like and all of them depict strong images of the Allies beating the Nazis. 'A lot of the posters would have been sent abroad to places like unoccupied France, Spain and Malta where troops would have had little idea of how the war was going in other areas. On sale: The evocative posters are expected to fetch £7,000 when they go up for auction in Dorset next week . Chilling: These images dramatically illustrate how damaging the consequences of talking about the war effort could be . Thanks: The Merchant Navy launched a propaganda campaign to highlight its own importance to the war effort . 'They would have served as little newsflashes to reassure soldiers that the Allies were winning the war. 'In some cases they would have been sent out when things were looking grim for the Allies as a way of boosting moral. 'A chunk of the posters concentrated on the Home Guard - those who stayed behind to keep the country running. 'Every citizen was expected to do their bit for the war effort and so posters were put up on hoardings and in bus and railway stations urging them to do so. 'The ""dig for victory"" campaign was designed to get people to be self sufficient and part of that was rearing chickens and pigs. 'Some of the more charming posters urge people to start ""pig clubs"" and feed food scraps to chickens. Write caption here . Artistic: The posters are mostly based on evocative paintings paired with striking and readable text . Back them up: The heroic image of inevitable victory projected by the posters was somewhat misleading given the ups and downs of the war . 'However, the ""careless talk costs lives"" series was probably the most successful propaganda campaign of the war. 'These days social networking makes it almost impossible to control information but back then the Ministry of Information was very keen to keep a tight lid on things. 'Posters were put up in public places including pubs and village halls with very obvious warnings not to gossip about anything to do with the war. 'To deter people the posters showed the scenes of devastation that would certainly have come true had Hitler gotten wind of any gossip. 'There is a very strong market for war posters and we expect there to be lots of interest in the sale.'","Proganda posters were meant to raise morale while urging Britons to stay vigilant and help the war effort .

"Rangers were sentenced to death after HMRC torpedoed Charles Green’s hopes of preserving the club in its current form via a CVA. The Revenue, who are owed over £21million by the beleaguered Ibrox club, rendered Thursday’s scheduled creditors’ meeting a formality by declaring they would oppose the proposal — thus ensuring the liquidation of Rangers Football Club plc, incorporated in 1899. Green had hoped his £8.5m offer would be enough to win the day, but with 38 per cent of the current £55m debt belonging to HMRC and 75-per-cent creditor approval required, their compliance was central to his plans. Scroll down to hear from some Rangers fans . Blow: The CVA deal will not be allowed . The Yorkshireman, who last night launched a broadside at HMRC for ‘misleading’ him, will now complete his purchase of Rangers’ assets — Ibrox Stadium, Murray Park and the Albion Car Park — for £5.5m at the end of this week. And the former Sheffield United chief executive will attempt to persuade the SPL to admit a newco Rangers into the top flight next season in the coming month. The new incarnation would require eight of the 12 club representatives to approve the move — a vote is likely to take place at the AGM on July 16 — but, if the newco entry is blocked, the new Rangers are likely to apply to join the Scottish Third Division — with Dundee, who were runners-up in the First Division, replacing them in the top flight. Regardless of what division they are playing in next season, the newco will be unable to compete in European football for three seasons. It will also require the approval of the SFA to compete in any league. Bad news: Charles Green confirmed the blow . And in another potential flashpoint for the club, Green and administrator Duff & Phelps are adamant the contracts of players will automatically transfer over to the new company — an issue hotly disputed by the players’ union, PFA Scotland, and a number of leading agents. On a day of extraordinary drama, which came 120 days after the club entered administration, Green reacted furiously to the mid-morning news that the Revenue would not back his plan. ‘It’s massively disappointing and I think to some extent we have been misled by HMRC,’ he said. ‘Duff & Phelps have consistently said to me that they were in dialogue with HMRC and that they hadn’t rejected the CVA route. ‘Irrespective of what I was being told by HMRC, my own advisors at Deloitte have been in dialogue with them, too. ‘To see them today saying this is a policy decision leaves me speechless.‘If that’s the case, is that a policy that was invented this week? Takeover turmoil: Rangers future hangs in the balance . ‘If not, why weren’t we told that in February or March? We could have gone into a newco then and saved a huge amount of money and time. ‘It would also have removed the false hope from Rangers fans.’ According to a statement from HMRC, ‘liquidation provides the best opportunity to protect taxpayers, by allowing the potential investigation and pursuit of possible claims against those responsible for the company’s financial affairs in recent years’. HMRC also stressed their decision did not undermine the sale of the club but would allow Rangers a ‘fresh start’. However, Green insists any investigation into former directors should not necessarily have precluded HMRC from agreeing to a CVA. He added: ‘I’m not a lawyer but, if a former director has done something wrong, he should be pursued. What next? Rangers face liquidation . ‘I don’t believe turning down a CVA is a price worth paying to pursue previous directors.’ Green promised to finally name his investors following the creditors’ meeting, saying: ‘We’ll reveal who is on the board, what the names of the directors are and all of the things the fans, the SFA and the SPL are looking to see. ‘The consortium’s capabilities are not affected at all.’ Green was given ‘preferred-bidder’ status by Duff & Phelps last month ahead of rival bidders like the Blue Knights, a consortium including former Rangers’ director Paul Murray and businessman Brian Kennedy. Joint administrator Paul Clark last night closed the door on any rival bid for the club’s assets being considered, claiming the agreement with Green’s Sevco consortium was ‘binding’. Men for the job: Paul Clarke and David Whitehouse from Duff & Phelps administrators . ‘We made it clear to the Blue Knights and others some weeks ago when we got to the stage of agreeing Charles Green’s offer, what the position was,’ Clark explained. ‘I very much expect that sale to be concluded later this week but not until after the CVA is rejected on Thursday.’ Clark predicted that the existing company would be wound up in the autumn. ‘To be honest, I don’t know exactly how quickly, but I would suspect it would take six to 10 weeks,’ he said. ‘One of the issues is there’s some ongoing litigation in relation to Collyer Bristow including a hearing in October and what we wouldn’t want to do is have a situation where that is harmed in any way. So we need to think that through.’ Duff & Phelps, administrators: . We have been informed by HMRC they will not support the proposal for a Company Voluntary Arrangement at the meeting of creditors on Thursday, June 14. As a result of this decision, the Sale and Purchase Agreement in place with the consortium led by Charles Green will take effect and Rangers Football Club will continue within a new company structure. The reasons HMRC have given to us for their decision to vote against the proposal are as follows. HMRC has cited its general policy of not agreeing to a CVA where there is strong evidence of non-compliance by a company with its tax liabilities. HMRC had agreed to consider a CVA proposal along with all other options in the case of Rangers but having taken into consideration the extent of funds which will be made available to creditors through the CVA option, they have decided that it is not acceptable given The Rangers Football Club plc's level of indebtedness to HMRC. It has also been made clear to us that other offers tendered for the Club, which took the form of a CVA, would have been treated in the same way and that the rejection is not a reflection of the Green consortium bid. HMRC has taken the view that the public interest will be better served with the liquidation of The Rangers Football Club plc as a corporate entity. The Club will continue to operate as it has always done but within a new company structure. HMRC consider that the decision will enable a liquidator to instigate a wider investigation into all of the financial affairs and management of the Club in recent years and to bring to task those they believe are responsible for its collapse. Furthermore, HMRC believes there will be an enhanced recovery of funds for creditors by pursuing those individuals who they believe are responsible. The consequence of the rejection of a CVA outcome is that sanctions will be applied to the Club by UEFA and that the Club will not be able to participate in Europe for three years and the new company will need the consent of the other SPL clubs to the transfer of the share in the SPL, in order for Rangers to continue playing in the SPL. As we have always stated, administrators have a primary objective to ensure the survival of the company and in this case, this would have been achieved through a CVA. It was with HMRC's approval, that a proposal was placed before creditors for consideration. However, it is the commercial view that the level offered within the CVA was not enough to merit departure from their normal policy of seeking a detailed investigation via a liquidator. However, we have been left in no doubt by HMRC the fundamental reason for the rejection of the CVA proposal is the historical non-compliance with tax liabilities by the former owners and directors of the Club. As we have stated previously, there is a binding contract between ourselves as administrators and Charles Green, who is leading a consortium to acquire the Club. The creditors' and shareholders' meetings will take place at Ibrox on Thursday but the results of those meetings will now be entirely academic given HMRC's decision. As soon as the CVA proposal is formally rejected, Mr Green's consortium will move towards completion of an acquisition of the business and assets of The Rangers Football Club plc. That transaction will be completed within a few days. The sum payable to creditors will be £5.5 million, most of which has already been paid over to us by the Green consortium. Over the coming months, we as administrators will continue to finalise the administration of the Club and we will work in conjunction with BDO who will undertake the liquidation process. We would like to thank the staff and supporters at Rangers for their great determination and professionalism during a very difficult period for the Club. While the Club will continue to face difficulties in the short term, it will survive and continue to play at Ibrox. HMRC: A liquidation provides the best opportunity to protect taxpayers, by allowing the potential investigation and pursuit of possible claims against those responsible for the company's financial affairs in recent years. A CVA would restrict the scope of such action. Moreover the liquidation route does not prejudice the proposed sale of the club. This sale can take place either through a CVA or a liquidation. So the sale is not being undermined, it simply takes a different route. Liquidation will enable a sale of the football assets to be made to a new company, thereby ensuring that football will continue at Ibrox. It also means that the new company will be free from claims or litigation in a way which would not be achievable with a CVA. Rangers can make a fresh start.","Rangers to be liquidated .

"Leave the luxury five-star resorts to mere mortals. To holiday like the truly rich and famous, it simply has to be a private island. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg made headlines earlier this week for shelling out more than $100 million (£62 million) for 700 acres on Kauai's North Shore and that whopping price didn't even buy him the entire island. But there are a number of wealthy names who have purchased their own private paradise - and most for well below what Zuckerberg paid.

"Labour risks being out of power until 2030 if Ed Miliband fails to win next year’s election, former Cabinet minister David Blunkett has warned. In a stark message to the party, the ex-Home Secretary claimed Labour would be left in the ‘wilderness for as much as 15 years’ if the Tories remain in power in 2015. The blunt message came as pressure mounts on Mr Miliband, after a string of gaffes and dire opinion polls which suggest voters do not think he is up to the job of being Prime Minister. Former Home Secretary David Blunkett warned defeat in 2015 for Ed Miliband would leave Labour in the 'wilderness' for 15 years . With less than a year to go, senior Labour figures have begun to voice doubts about Mr Miliband’s ability to seal the deal with the electorate. Mr Blunkett insisted he thought Mr Miliband could win the election and was the 'only man' for the job of leading the party. But he issued a warning that if Labour loses next year, the party will be out of office for a generation. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'I think we would be in the wilderness for as much as 15 years because all the changes that the Conservative majority government would bring in would actually not be about fairness or equity or even sharing power, it would be about excluding the Labour Party. ‘We are talking about the future of the people we care about, we are talking about how we handle continuing levels of austerity and fairness, and whether the rich get richer and those at the very, very sharp end of austerity measures, the loss of public services gets worse. ‘Yes, we are talking about whether the vehicle for achieving everything that I stood for, and I have been in the Labour Party for 51 years, would be made that much more difficult by victory in 2015 by the Conservatives.’ The blind former home secretary told his local party in Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough that he would not seek re-election in next year's contest, ending a career as an MP which began in 1987. Labour is ahead in the opinion polls but voters are less impressed with Mr Miliband as a leader . Just 11 per cent of people think Mr Miliband is a strong leader and only 21 per cent say he is up to the job of being Prime Minister . Meanwhile John Denham, a former frontbencher trying to win back support in the south of England, warned the party is losing working class voters. He told a One Nation conference on June 5 that warned that working-class voters 'don't believe they are in any story that Labour is telling about the future of this country', the Sunday Times reported.. ‘They can list lots of other people that they think are in Labour's story, but not them. And it's not a matter of having a policy for this or for that, but actually including them legitimately in the story and saying: 'You are part of the people that we're here for. He added: 'If they're not part of our story I don't know what the Labour party is for.' A YouGov poll for the Sunday Times showed just 11 per cent of people think Mr Miliband has been a strong leader, 21 per cent say he is up to the job of being Prime Minister and only 25 per cent think he is in touch with ordinary people . To add to the sense of crisis, former leader Neil Kinnock rushed to Mr Miliband’s defence. Lord Kinnock, who led Labour to two crushing defeats in the 1980s and 1990s, praised Mr Miliband’s ‘great personal and political courage’. In an interview with The Observer, Lord Kinnock blamed the media for the leader’s woes and hit out at the 'vindictiveness' of the press. But he added: 'It won't stop him; his genuine strengths of thought, action and toughness will get through and help to win victory.' Former Labour leader Neil Kinnock (left) and shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna (right) have leapt to Mr Miliband's defence . Shadow business secretary Chuka Umunna took to the airwaves to defend his leader as a 'man of great beliefs'. Mr Miliband has faces claims he has developed big political concepts but fails to connect with voters on a day-to-day basis. Mr Umunna told BBC1's Andrew Marr Show: 'We are not playing some game of Celebrity Big Brother. We are talking about big issues that are affecting all of our different communities - how are we going to pay our way in the world, how are we going to ensure that everybody can achieve their dreams and realise their aspirations? 'If Ed is guilty of focusing on the issues that people really care about and taking a serious, deep, hard long look at what needs to happen in our economy to change it, then fine. 'Because that is what he is seriously focused on.'","Blunkett says victory for the Tories will keep them in power for 15 years .

"A Japanese soldier who refused to surrender after the Second World War ended and spent 29 years hiding in the jungle while continuing a guerilla war has died aged 91. Hiroo Onoda remained on an island in the Philippines until 1974 because he did not believe the war was over. He became the last Japanese soldier to surrender – but only after his former commander, who in 1945 had told him to stay behind and spy on American troops, was flown from Japan to order him to give up. Scroll down for video . Onoda (centre) salutes after handing over a military sword on Lubang Island in 1974 . Hiroo Onoda holds a picture of himself (left), taken when he came out of hiding from the jungle. On the right is a shot of Onoda in 1974, wearing his 30-year-old imperial army uniform, cap and sword, saluting to the Philippine Air Force on arrival at a radar site on Lubang Island, Philippines, after he'd come out of hiding in the jungle . His extraordinary determination to . carry on made Mr Onoda a hero in his homeland, although he was said to . have killed 30 people while evading capture. His story was turned into a . film and a book. He had come out of hiding, erect but emaciated, on Lubang island on his 52nd birthday. During . his formal surrender to Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, Mr Onoda . saluted the Japanese flag and symbolically handed over his samurai . sword while still wearing an army uniform that had been patched many . times over. His generation . was taught absolute loyalty to Japan and its emperor. Soldiers in the . Imperial Army observed a code that said death was preferable to . surrender. Mr Onoda, a . lieutenant in army intelligence, had been sent to Lubang, 90 miles . south-west of the Philippine capital Manila, in December 1944. Onoda (second left) walking from the jungle where he had hidden since World War II, on Lubang island in the Philippines . Most . of his comrades surrendered when US troops landed on the island less . than three months later but he refused to give up and remained in the . jungle with three other soldiers. He . later recalled: ‘Every Japanese soldier was prepared for death, but as . an intelligence officer I was ordered to conduct guerilla warfare and . not to die. ‘I became an officer and I received an order. If I could not carry it out, I would feel shame. I am very competitive.’ At . least four attempts were made to find him, during which family members . appealed to him over loudspeakers and flights dropped leaflets urging . him to surrender. Onoda, wearing his 30-year-old imperial army uniform, cap and sword, walks down a slope as he heads for a helicopter landing site on Lubang Island for a flight to Manila, having finally accepted that hostilities had ended . This picture taken on March 11, 1974, shows Onoda (right) offering his military sword to former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos (left) to express his surrender at the Malacanan Palace in Manila . As he . struggled to feed himself, Mr Onoda’s mission became one of survival. He . stole rice and bananas from villagers, and shot their cows to make . dried beef, triggering occasional skirmishes. Three . other soldiers were with him at the end of the war. One emerged from . the jungle in 1950 and the other two died, one in a 1972 clash with . local troops. The turning . point came on February 20, 1974, when Mr Onoda met a young globetrotter, . Norio Suzuki, who had ventured to Lubang in pursuit of the veteran . soldier. Mr Suzuki quietly . pitched camp in jungle clearings and waited. Mr Onoda eventually made . contact with a simple ‘Oi’, and they began to talk. Onoda (centre) waving upon his return home, at Tokyo international airport, on March 12, 1974 . Mr . Suzuki returned to Japan and contacted the government, which called in . the soldier’s superior, Major Yoshimi Taniguchi, to bring about a . surrender. The Philippine . government pardoned Mr Onoda although many in Lubang never forgave him . for the 30 people he killed during his campaign on the island. Mr . Onoda struggled to adapt to life on his return to Japan and he . emigrated to Brazil in 1975 to become a farmer. He finally settled in . his homeland in 1984 and opened nature camps for children. He did not consider his 30 years in the jungle to have been a waste of time. ‘Without . that experience, I wouldn’t have my life today’ he said. ‘I do . everything twice as fast so I can make up for the 30 years. I wish . someone could eat and sleep for me so I can work 24 hours a day.’","Hiroo Onoda was the last Japanese imperial soldier to emerge from hiding .
