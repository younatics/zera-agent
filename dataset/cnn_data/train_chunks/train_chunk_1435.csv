"A media investigation into the allegations of rape featured in Lena Dunham's recently-released memoir has refuted the claims of sexual assault made by the Girls creator. The writer, actor and director dedicates a chapter of her book, Not That Kind Of Girl - for which she received a reported $3.7 million advance - to a boy she met at Oberlin College in Ohio identified as 'Barry', who she alleges raped her one night after a party. The 28-year-old admits in the tome to drinking alcohol and taking Xanax and cocaine before inviting Barry back to her on-campus apartment, but says the encounter quickly turned aggressive, and that Barry twice removed the condom during intercourse without telling her. 'I never gave permission to be rough, to stick himself inside me without a barrier between us,' she wrote. Scroll down for video . Rape claims: In her memoir Not That Kind of Girl, Lena Dunham (seen here in New York on December 2) alleges she was raped in college. A new media investigation claims there is no proof of the man she describes . 'I never gave him permission. 'In my deepest self I know this, and the knowledge of it has kept me from sinking.' Dunham's description of Barry is similarly explicit, explaining him as a 'mustachioed campus Republican' with a 'mustache that rode the line between ironic Williamsburg fashion and big buck hunter', who hosted a radio show called Real Talk With Jimbo, worked in the library stacking shelves and 'wore purple cowboy boots'. She also said that he once punched a girl 'in the boob' at a party and, following a consensual sexual encounter, another girl woke to find blood spattered all over the wall 'like a crime scene'. Furthermore Dunham does not state that 'Barry' is a pseudonym, as she does with other names that appear in her book. An investigation by John Nolte from Breitbart News undertaken at the Oberlin campus, which was published Thursday, concluded that the 'Barry' Dunham describes is a 'ghost', and that no such person appeared to exist at the college during the years she studied there. 'In fact, we could not find anyone who remembered any Oberlin Republican who matched Dunham's colorful description,' Nolte wrote. 'Under scrutiny, Dunham's rape story didn’t just fall apart, it evaporated into pixie dust and blew away.' Scene: It is believed the rape Dunham describes in her book took place at Oberlin College in Ohio (pictured) in the winter of 2005 following a party . The Breitbart report followed an attack on Dunham by The National Review's hard-right columnist Kevin Williamson, who said she was 'grossly irresponsible' for publishing the rape claim in the first place. Williamson said he spoke to a Barry who was a prominent Republican that attended Oberlin and that has been hounded by the media since the release of Not That Kind Of Girl in September. This Barry told Williamson he has never met Dunham and did not have any kind of relationship with her. He said the fact his name is Barry and that he is a Republican who went to Oberlin is 'the 'most unfortunate coincidence of my life'. The man, who is married with kids, said he is petrified that his full name is going to be published. Williamson then wrote of Dunham: 'It is at the very least the deployment of weaponized celebrity without any concern for collateral damage. 'I have my doubts about whether the encounter Dunham describes actually happened at all; in her memoir, she writes about presenting anecdotes from other people’s lives as her own. 'But, for the record, the man to whom I spoke does not believe that Dunham intended to refer to him.' The Breitbart investigation, which describes Dunham as 'one of the most powerful and influential women in America', included the account of Williamson's 'Barry'. It notes that friends of his laughed at the suggestion of him ever having a moustache and that other details given by Dunham also didn't fit. Nolte then goes in search of someone else that might fit the description. He deduces the alleged rape occurred in winter 2005. A search of the campus newspaper archives and Oberlin College graduation announcements did not find any Barry - other than the one Williamson spoke to - who graduated or attended Oberlin College in 2005, 2006, or 2007. Massive publicity tour:  Lena Dunham meets fans and signs copies of her book 'Not That Kind Of Girl' at Waterstones in London on October 29, 2014 . A further search of the campus for someone not named Barry but who fits the description given by Dunham also showed no results. There was no proof of a radio show called Real Talk With Jimbo, he said. 'Nevertheless, no amount of digging could verify even a single detail of Dunham's rape claim,' Nolte wrote. The report criticizes Dunham for pointing the finger at this one Barry in such a public manner, as opposed to reporting what happened to her to the authorities. Dunham has not responded to the Brietbart News piece. Calls to Random House, the publisher of Not That Kind Of Girl, and to Dunham's literary agent made by MailOnline were not immediately returned on Thursday. Dunham did however react to Williamson when his piece was published last month. She took to Twitter to defend her story. Love: Dunham is seen here at the 2014 Golden Globes with her boyfriend, musician Jack Antonoff . 'Some men are enraged by stories of sexual assault that don't have clear cut villains, pimps or men with guns,' she wrote. 'That's because these stories force them to ask hard questions about their history with consent. 'Well, we all have to ask hard questions. Grow the f--- up. 'And I have some news for certain 'news' outlets. No matter how much you thump your keyboards with your meat hands we will not stop talking.' This is not the only controversy to come from Dunham's tome. The New York native cancelled several appearances on her book tour after being accused of molesting her younger sister as a child. In one chapter of the book she describes how, as a seven-year-old, she experimented with her sister Grace, who was one at the time. 'One day, as I sat in our driveway in Long Island playing blocks and buckets, my curiosity got the better of me,' Dunham wrote. 'Grace was sitting up, babbling smiling, and I leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina.' The accusations were mostly spearheaded by Williamson, who said her behavior was child abuse. Dunham came back swinging, writing on Twitter: 'The right wing news story that I molested my little sister isn’t just LOL- it’s really f---ing upsetting and disgusting. Family: Dunham was accused of molesting her younger sister Grace (pictured) by two media outlets following a controversial chapter in her book, where she admits to experiment with her sibling as a child . 'And by the way, if you were a little kid and never looked at another little kid’s vagina, well, congrats to you. 'Usually this is stuff I can ignore but don’t demean sufferers, don’t twist my words, . 'I told a story about being a weird 7 year old. I bet you have some too, old men, that I’d rather not hear. 'And yes, this is a rage spiral.'","Actor, 28, alleges that she was raped at Oberlin College in her memoir Not That Kind Of Girl .

"‘He's the best scaffolder we’ve got’, declares the company boss as his star employee lifts the FA Cup. ‘Big and strong, good pair of hands, reliable,’ the gaffer continues. ‘Don’t drop it,’ hollers one colleague. Not a chance. Peter Jeffries is stood on top of the scaffolding he has just assembled in double-quick time. In his grasp is the iconic cup, glistening amid the gloom of a murky morning on Teesside. Blyth Spartans goalkeeper and scaffolder Peter Jeffries holds the FA Cup at work . Jeffries is clad in a navy boilersuit, luminous jacket and safety harness complete with the tools of his trade. On Friday night, however, he will be wearing nothing more than a goalkeeper’s kit and a pair of gloves. He will be at Hartlepool United’s Victoria Park, just a few miles from his place of work and a goal-kick away from where he grew up and now lives. But Jeffries – a former season-ticket holder at The Vic – will not be turning out for his hometown club. Instead, in front of live television cameras and playing at a ‘proper’ ground for the first time, he will be representing the green and white of one of the competition’s most celebrated minnows. Blyth Spartans, the Northern League club, made it to the fifth round in 1978 – losing 2-1 in a replay to Wrexham in front of 42,000 at St James’ Park - and were beaten 1-0 by Blackburn Rovers in the third round in 2009. The 28-year-old will be in goal for Blyth against his hometown team, Hartlepool United, in the FA Cup . That same year, Jeffries was part of the Travellers Rest pub team which triumphed in the Hartlepool Sunday Morning Cup against Throston Wanderers - victory in the second round of the FA Cup on Friday evening and the likes of Manchester United and Chelsea lie in wait. ‘It’s mad,’ the 28-year-old tells Sportsmail as we sit in the boardroom of his firm’s headquarters and he stares at the FA Cup resting next to us. ‘It’s magic. I know that gets said a lot, but the early rounds is where the magic of the cup is now. This is what it’s all about. ‘I was playing on a Sunday morning not so long ago. Now I’m on telly at a proper ground, at the place I went with my dad and two brothers as a kid and with all my family and friends from Hartlepool in the Blyth end - although I had to convince my dad to go in! ‘We really think we’ve got a chance to win as well. Hartlepool are struggling, they’re bottom of League Two. We’ve been flying in the cup, we love it. From that very first match this is what you dream about. Jeffries (centre) holding the famous old trophy at work with his brother Richard (right) and Michael Sweet . ‘The FA Cup history of the club is the first thing they tell you about when you sign. It’s massive, they get about £70,000 with this being on TV and that could help us with promotion in the long run’. Blyth, like the majority of the other 232 non-League sides who took part in first round qualifying in September, would have been watching this weekend’s ties on the TV had it not been for Jeffries. They were goalless away at Darlington 1883 FC when the hosts and strong favourites were awarded a second-half penalty. Jeffries recalls: ‘Myself and the goalkeeping coach, John Bottensien, had looked the night before at where their lad put his penalties. ‘It was a one-off special game so we did the research. He either goes top left or top right. I decided to dive as far as I could to my left and somehow saved it. I have no idea how I did. I just threw everything I could that way and ended up saving it with my right hand, tipping it on to the post - we might not have been here without that save.’ Jeffries (left) with his brother Richard, holding a trophy he won with the Travellers Rest pub team in 2009 . That same year, Blyth played Premier League side Blackburn in the FA Cup third round . FA Cup second round . Kick-off: 7.55pm, Victoria Park. TV: LIVE on BBC2 from 7.30. Referee: Andrew Madley. Blyth won 3-0 in the replay before negotiating away ties at Skelmersdale United (4-1), Mickleover Sports (2-1) and Leek Town (4-3). They then hammered Conference side Altrincham 4-1 in the first round proper. Jeffries was in the living-room with his wife, Toni, and children Amy, six, and Harry, three, when Hartlepool emerged from the hat in the second round draw. ‘When Hartlepool came out there were still 20-odd balls left in,’ he says. ‘Then it was number 39. I just thought, “Wow, that’s us”. I started jumping all over the living-room, my family didn’t know what was going on. My daughter was a bit scared I think.’ He adds: ‘To go back to The Vic will be special. I was going during their best-ever period – the League One play-off final in 2005 and Sunderland away in the FA Cup when we took nearly 10,000. I went all over the country with them. The play-off final in Cardiff was probably my best day as a fan, even though we got beat.’ All the while, football-mad Jeffries was a striker. Jeffries talks to Sportsmail's Craig Hope in the boardroom of the scaffolding company . ‘I wasn’t a goalkeeper until I was 19, I was a centre forward, or at least I told myself that,’ he reveals. ‘One Sunday morning I got put in goal when we were short. Everyone started telling me that I wasn’t bad. People started to come to watch me. ‘I actually wanted to play in goal when I was about eight, but my dad said no. I often tell him that if I’d started earlier as a keeper I might have made it much higher in the game.’ A move to Hartlepool FC and then Bishop Auckland followed before Blyth paid Spennymoor Town £3,000 for Jeffries in the summer. He is already a crowd favourite at Croft Park. Juggling a young family, work and his football, however, can prove even more difficult than keeping out penalties. Hope and Jeffries pose with the FA Cup ahead of the Hartlepool clash on Friday night . ‘We train twice a week and it’s an hour and 10 minutes up to Blyth,’ he explains. ‘I work from 8am to half four, so it’s quite a gruelling schedule. I get in, get my stuff and head straight out. ‘Scaffolding is hard graft as well, very hard. I’m not a desk, I’m constantly climbing and lifting. I have broken my fingers quite a times. You do feel it and it takes your back and arms a while to adjust. But it keeps me fit and strong and it helps with my goalkeeping I suppose – I’m using my hands all the time anyway!’ On Friday, at least, Jeffries has been afforded some time off. The star scaffolder has a bigger job on his hands across town.","Peter Jeffries will line up for Blyth Spartans against Hartlepool .

"Entertainment reporter Michael Ausiello has revealed in a moving online post that he is taking time off as his husband reaches the end of his cancer battle. Ausiello, a former TV Guide and Entertainment Weekly reporter, made the announcement on his television website, TVLine.com, on Thursday. He revealed that his husband, photographer Kit Cowan, 41, has been battling against 'a rare and aggressive Neuroendocrine cancer' for the past nine months.

"The girlfriend of a man who shot and killed a German exchange student in his garage broke down in tears as her 911 call was re-played to a court. Janelle Pflager's  distraught voice was heard by the court during the 911 call she made after her boyfriend, Markus Kaarma, allegedly shot and killed Diren Dede, 17. She described how the teenager was lying face down 'barely breathing' and bleeding from 'everywhere' in their Missoula, Montana home. Scroll down for video . Family: Marcus Kaarma, right, is followed into Missoula District Court by his girlfriend Janelle Pflager with their child, the court heard a 911 call made by Pflager about the events that unfolded . Fear: Kaarma allegedly felt targeted and increasingly anxious for the safety of Pflager and their infant son . She told dispatchers that Kaarma didn't help her as she tried to aid the  wounded high school student, who died a short time later at a Missoula hospital. Kaarma is charged with baiting the teenager into sneaking into his Missoula garage early on April 27 and killing him with four shotgun blasts after being alerted by a motion detector. Defense attorney Paul Ryan says Montana's 'stand your ground' law allows homeowners to protect their residences with deadly force when they believe they are going to be harmed. But Kaarma didn't know whether the person inside the garage was armed, Ryan said. However he had allegedly felt targeted and increasingly anxious for the safety of Pflager and their infant son after the couple had been burglarized twice in the days leading up to the shooting. On the first day of testimony, two teenagers, Mykle Martin, 17, and Trisitan Staber, 18, described how they went 'garage hopping,' or burglarizing garages, in search of alcohol and other things after dark and hit Markus Kaarma's house. 'I was the previous break-in,' Martin said, his voice at times barely audible. 'I'm the reason he (Kaarma) was waiting for another person.' The court also heard audio tapes of Pflager's police interview after the shooting. She told officers that Dede had pleaded for his life, saying, 'No, no, no, no, no, please!' However, she later testified that Dede had not said anything and that she was 'rambling' to officers because she was traumatized. 'I did not hear those words,' she said. 'I wish I said those words.' Pflager's testimony came during the second day of Kaarma's deliberate homicide trial. Victim: Diren Dede (left), 17, was shot dead on April 27 after allegedly breaking into Kaarma's garage . Trial: Kaarma sits with his legal team during witness testimony in Missoula County Court in Missoula, Montana on December 5, 2014 . Pflager said Thursday that she kept a baseball bat nearby while Kaarma moved a shotgun to the first floor of their home after the previous burglaries. Testimony indicated Kaarma was upset and on edge at the time. Michael McMillan, who works for a local lawn care company told how he came to the Kaarma house on April 23 to spray for insects. While he was setting up, he said an angry Kaarma come out the front door naked, pointed a shotgun at him and asked what McMillan was doing there. 'I was scared, frozen,' McMillan said. He said Pflager started screaming at Kaarma to stop and he went back inside the house. McMillan said Pflager later apologized and told him they were on edge due to burglaries. McMillan said he did not call police. That same day, Kaarma went for a haircut, and three women from the shop testified Thursday that they heard him say he had been waiting up nights to shoot an intruder. The dead teenager's father, Celal Dede, grimaced while listening to the 911 recording and then whispered to his attorneys that accompanied him and his wife.","Janelle Pflager's distraught voice could be heard on the 911 call .

"Wasteful spending by the public sector on useless projects costs every British household £4,500 a year - enough to 'buy a luxury holiday for every family', a pressure group has claimed. The TaxPayers’ Alliance has identified cuts that it says could save about £120billion – effectively wiping out the UK’s budget deficit – without ‘closing a single hospital, firing a single teacher or disbanding a single regiment’. The organisation has collated a list of ‘ludicrous examples of wasteful spending’ – including the Ministry of Defence paying £22 for a light bulb and the Arts Council squandering £95,000 on an installation comprising a skip covered in yellow lights. Waste: Despite Chancellor George Osborne's austerity drive, the TaxPayers' Alliance has identified a long list of 'ludicrous examples of wasteful spending' Some £19,000 was spent by Cotswold District Council on hiring a ‘motivational magician’ to boost staff morale, while Labour-run Durham Council gave chiefs a £12,000 clothing allowance, which Prime Minister David Cameron derided as ‘Geordie Armani’. In other examples: . The alleged wasteful spending - a sixth of the total government expenditure - is more than the whole of the NHS budget and five times the amount spent by the Ministry of Defence. A spokesman for alliance said: ' This equates to a massive £4,500 for every household inn the UK - enough to give every family in the land a luxury holiday or pay their household energy bills three times over.' In its annual Big Bumper Book of Government Waste, the TaxPayers’ Alliance recommends a number of major reforms to claw back cash, including shaving £53billion off the pay and pensions packages of public sector workers. This is the amount it claims these workers are being overpaid compared with the private sector average. ‘Nearly £120billion of taxpayers’ money was wasted or spent on useless projects by the Government in 2011-12,’ the report states. ‘We have identified and listed hundreds of examples of spending by politicians and bureaucrats that can be cut without closing a single hospital, firing a single teacher or disbanding a single regiment.’ According to the research – which the pressure group said is based on official statistics, independent reports and media coverage – £25billion was wasted that year through inefficient public sector procurement and poor use of outsourcing, while £20.3billion was lost through public sector fraud. About £5billion was paid out in benefits to claimants with an income in excess of £100,000, while £1.2billion was paid out in an annual subsidy to foreign farmers through the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy. Frontline services: The TaxPayers' Alliance says it can identify cuts in government spending that would not affect any hospital, education or army expenses . Cheshire East Council spent £30,000 building two ponds for 18 newts which had been displaced by the construction of a bypass. Arts Council paid £2.5 million to decorate the side of inter-continental trucks to promote Lincolnshire Fenlands in Europe. The Government biscuit bill in 2011-2012 was £3 million. Ministry of Justice spent £4.5 million to taxi firms for moving prisoners and staff around the country. Bury Council bought £9,000 iPads for bin collectors to monitor homes that were not recycling. Home Office paid £427,000 on rubber bullets police are not even allowed to use. Cotswold Council hired a 'motivational magician'  to boost staff morale at a cost of £19,000 . The TaxPayers’ Alliance suggests . £2.9billion could be saved by scrapping the Department for Business, . Innovation and Skills and Department for Culture, Media and Sport and . hiving off their essential functions to other departments. It . also questions the need for high spending on locum doctors, suggesting . there could be far fewer now that GPs work out-of hours far less . frequently than they used to. Matthew . Sinclair, chief executive of the TaxPayers’ Alliance, said: ‘George . Osborne must take the golden opportunity offered by the spending review . to get the nation’s finances under control and ease the burden on . taxpayers.’ According . to the report, tens of billions of pounds are still wasted each year and . there is an enormous amount of fat left in the public sector. 'If ministers do something about it, . they can give taxpayers a better deal and still provide the frontline . services which people depend on. ‘More . money must be left in the pockets of struggling households who need it . to support their own families and their own causes.’ The Cabinet Office insisted work was well under way to make government ‘leaner’. A spokesman added: ‘This Government has accelerated its work tackling waste and the Cabinet Office recently announced achieved savings of £10billion over 2012-13. ‘We are taking radical decisions to make Whitehall leaner and more efficient so Britain can compete in the global race, and we are pleased to see the TaxPayers’ Alliance recognises this – but we agree there is more to do.’","Costs include £19,000 spent by council on hiring ‘motivational magician’

"It is often said that the greatest leaders are those who can delegate responsibility. Prime Ministers, Presidents and world leaders have all spoken through history of the effectiveness of spreading the burden of power amongst the right people. This is an approach which Roy Hodgson is adopting as England manager by handing extra responsibility to Daniel Sturridge, Jordan Henderson and Gary Cahill to act as 'unit leaders' among his squad. England boss Roy Hodgson has created 'unit leaders' within his squad to improve performances . The England manager is trying something different in the wake of a diabolical World Cup in Brazil and the need to reignite the national mood around the team. Hodgson has set up 'unit meetings' – split into attack, midfield and defence – in an attempt to get his team animated. Striker Sturridge, midfielder Henderson and defender Cahill have been handed the responsibility of galvanising their respective groups. In these meetings England coaches play videos of matches and training to talk players through how they can improve, but it is no longer a one-way process. Hodgson (left) has appointed striker Daniel Sturridge (right) as his attack 'unit leader' in the England squad . 'There are three units,' Hodgson explained ahead of Euro 2016 qualifiers against San Marino and Estonia next week. 'We're trying to encourage players to take responsibility, to take ownership of their performances and to speak out. 'So the meetings aren't just the coaches with their videos and their principles telling the players this is it, this is what we expect you to do. 'We're asking them to stand up themselves and make certain, so when we leave the meeting we know the players have understood everything completely, that there's no chance they've sat there quietly listening to us, nodding their heads wisely but not fully certain of what's required.' This is a far cry from the scene set by Rio Ferdinand when he claimed that England players were 'treated like complete babies' in the launch of his new book last week. Jordan Henderson (left) and Gary Cahill (right) have been named midfield and defence 'unit leaders' Hodgson pointed out that the Queens Park Rangers defender had never been a part of any of his squads since he took charge two-and-a-half years ago. And this is very much Hodgson empowering his players to stand up and be counted. 'In each of the groups I've asked people like Daniel Sturridge, Gary Cahill and Jordan Henderson to make certain they animate the group, that they prod people,' Hodgson added. 'We'll prod, the coaches, but I've always prodded in every team meeting I've done. I've always asked for questions, but often you don't get a response. 'I'm asking for the prodding to come from the players themselves where one of them will turn round to the group and say, 'Look, what do you think? Do you understand? Is the message clear to you? Do you really now understand what's required?' 'Get people to speak, that's what it's all about.' Hodgson (right) has been quick to defend questions about England captain Wayne Rooney's (left) At the head of them all is captain Wayne Rooney. His temperament and ability to lead the national team has been questioned since he was sent off for kicking Stewart Downing in Manchester United's match against West Ham last weekend. But Hodgson insisted: 'If someone wants to write that Rooney hasn't got the temperament I can't stop them doing it. All I can tell you is: they are wrong. 'I am happy with Rooney, I am happy with the role he is playing, I am happy with the responsibility he is taking, and I think the other players are too. 'He is filling big boots. Not just of Steven Gerrard, he has played in teams with different captains before him and many of them were top men.' Rooney (centre) was sent off in Manchester United's 2-1 win against West Ham last weekend . Rooney (right) was sent off for kicking out at Stewart Downing in their Premier League encounter last week . Hodgson added: 'The great thing with Wayne as it was with Steve, is the passion they have for football, for their country, and for their clubs – both were basically one-club men if you take Rooney leaving Everton at a young age. 'They can transmit that passion to a lot of the younger players. They can get their points across.'","Roy Hodgson has named Daniel Sturridge, Gary Cahill and Jordan Henderson as his 'unit leaders' among his England squad .

"The mother of a diplomat killed during a terrorist raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi has blamed President Barack Obama for her son’s death. Sean Smith was killed along with ambassador Chris Stevens and security men - both former U.S. Navy SEALS - Glen Doherty and Tyrone Woods by terrorists in Libya on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 this year. The families of three of the victims are divided in their reactions to reports that American personnel were refused help, despite several requests. 'Murdered': Pat Smith (right), the mother of diplomat Sean Smith (left) who was killed during a terrorist raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi blames President Barack Obama for her son's death . While Sean’s mother Patricia Smith has said that the president ‘murdered her son’ and Mr Woods’ father has echoed her sentiment, Mr Doherty’s brother has said that civilians could not comment on military tactics with any credibility. Mrs Smith, 72 told the U-T San Diego: ‘I believe that Obama murdered my son.’ She said that her son was a strong supporter of Obama. In an interview with Jon Stewart on Comedy Central last month Obama responded to a question about his administration's confused communication after the assault by saying: 'If four Americans get killed, it’s not optimal.' 'Not optimal': President Barack Obama, left, discussed the killing of four men in Benghazi while speaking to Jon Stewart, right, on The Daily Show said: 'If four Americans get killed, it's not optimal' 'Guilty of murder': Charles Woods (right), the father of Tyrone Woods (left), the former U.S. Navy SEAL who died in the attack, condemned U.S. officials' decisions during the incident . In response, speaking exclusively to . MailOnline last month, Mrs Smith from San Diego said: 'It was a disrespectful thing . to say and I don't think it's right. 'How . can you say somebody being killed is not very optimal? I don't think . the President has the right idea of the English language.' Charles Woods, the father of 41-year-old Mr Woods condemned U.S. officials’ decisions during the attack on Fox News. Rage: A protester hols his rifle during the assault on the Benghazi consulate . Wrong to blame Obama: Barbara Doherty (right), the mother of Greg Doherty (left) who also died during the attack while working as a security contractor said it was 'wrong to use these brave men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama' He said:  ‘I’m a retired attorney, and I know that these actions legally do not constitute murder but in my mind the people in the White House, all of them who have authority to send in reinforcements to prevent what they knew was going to be the death of my son, are guilty of murdering my son.’ He later told the U-T San Diego: ‘I don’t want this to become political and become dishonouring to Ty.’ Greg Doherty, the older brother of former Navy SEAL Mr Doherty, who was working as an American security contractor, said that the pair responded to the attack and that they rescued people during the assault. He said: ‘They had enough people to fight off that battle. ‘I don’t think it is civilians’ job to pick apart an actual battle and talk strategy unless you are a general.' Attack: The men were killed in the September 11 assault on the U.S. embassy in Benghazi, pictured . Killed: Ambassador Chris Stevens died along with three others in the embassy attack . Mr Doherty said people were just looking for ways to point the blame at President Obama. His mother, Barbara Doherty told Fox News: ‘It’s wrong to use these brave men, who wanted freedom for all, to degrade Obama.’ In the interview Stewart asked Obama: 'Is part of the investigation helping the communication between these divisions? Not just what happened in Benghazi, but what happened within. 'Because I would say, even you would admit, it was not the optimal response, at least to the American people, as far as all of us being on the same page.' Obama responded: 'Here's what I’ll say. If four Americans get killed, it’s not optimal.' He said: 'We’re going to fix it. All . of it. And what happens, during the course of a presidency, is that the . government is a big operation and any given time something screws up and . you make sure that you find out what’s broken and you fix it. 'Whatever . else I have done throughout the course of my presidency the one thing . that I’ve been absolutely clear about is that America’s security comes, . and the American people need to know exactly how I make decisions when . it comes to war, peace, security, and protecting Americans. 'And they will continue to get that over the next four years of my presidency.' Inferno: Armed attackers dumped cans of diesel fuel and set ablaze the consulate's exterior . Flames, grenades and gunfire: A burnt-out car in front of the U.S. consulate . Anniversary of 9/11: The embassy in Benghazi was left gutted after the attack done by terrorists in Libya on the 11th anniversary of 9/11 this year . The word 'optimal' was first used by Stewart in the question but Obama's use of it, in a sound bite that could be used to portray him as somewhat casual about the deaths, lit up conservatives on the internet after it was first reported in a White House pool report by Mike Memoli of the Los Angeles Times. It recently emerged that the U.S. government was told that the attack had been carried out by militants, not a spontaneous mob, within just 24 hours of its taking place. A diplomatic cable sent the day after the raid suggested that militants had previously planned to attack the consulate, and used the excuse of protests against the anti-Muslim video as cover for their assault. It is unclear who, if anyone, saw the cable outside the CIA at that point and how high up in the agency the information went. But the statement directly contradicts the explanation of the attack given by the administration over the following two weeks. The debate comes as the presidential election campaign heats up as Election Day, on November 6, draws closer.","Four men were killed in the terrorist raid on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi .

"The Royal Air Force has spent £14,000 of taxpayers' cash on a golf simulator - despite losing 10,000 staff in just four years as part of Ministry of Defence cuts. The indoor device, which enables members of the RAF's golf team to train in the winter, has been installed at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire. But with the salary of a new airman said to be just under £14,500 during basic training, the decision has already sparked anger. The Royal Air Force has spent £14,000 of taxpayers' cash on a golf simulator, it has been revealed (file picture) The Sunday Times reports that the simulator cost a total of £23,000 with £13,960 coming from a grant funded by the taxpayer. It is for the use of both the men's and ladies' golf teams at the RAF - but all armed forces personnel can use it for a £20 annual subscription. The newspaper quotes Flight Sergeant Jai Henderson as telling RAF News: 'It is an excellent coaching tool which will be utilised by the RAF golf team throughout the winter season to develop their players.' But the purchase of the simulator, which is of a standard used by golf professionals, has already attracted criticism. The indoor device, designed to allow members of the RAF's golf team to train in the winter, has been installed at RAF Cranwell (pictured) in Lincolnshire . The Sunday Times reports that the RAF has lost more than 9,500 personnel since 2010 amid deep cuts by the MoD. The newspaper quotes Andy Silverster from the campaign group the Taxpayers' Alliance, as saying the machine 'simply isn't the priority' when it comes to defence spending. But an MoD spokesman told The Sunday Times: 'The golf facility at RAF Cranwell is open to all HM forces serving personnel and, in addition to generating interest and participation in golf, provides an excellent recreational outlet to the balance and wellbeing of our personnel.'","The RAF has installed the £14,000 device at RAF Cranwell in Lincolnshire .

"Success: The way to a woman's heart is simple - wear a t-shirt . Forget expensive designer clothes, a simple T-shirt could be the best way to capture a woman’s heart. Wearing a plain white short-sleeved top with a large black letter T printed on the front can make a man up to 12 per cent more attractive, scientists claim. Researchers suggest it creates an illusion that broadens the shoulders and slims the waist, producing a more V-shaped body – a sign of masculinity. The best results were observed in participants who were most out of shape, with already toned individuals only gaining a slight increase in perceived attractiveness. In contrast, all those wearing a top with an inverted ‘T’ - with the bar running around their waist - were deemed up to 12 per cent less attractive. It suggests shifting the focus to a man’s gut reduces his desirability. The team said a waist-to-chest ratio (WCR) of between 0.7 and 0.8 - where the shoulders are around 20 per cent broader than the hips - was seen as the ideal. Nottingham Trent University psychologist Dr Andrew Dunn said: ‘The wider barred ‘T’ seems to emphasise the upper chest when upright, which accentuates men’s ‘optimum’ shape. The opposite happens when inverted. ‘WCR is one of just a number of body measures that humans use to judge attractiveness and health. 'Our ability to detect, process and use this information appears to be implicit. 'The brain and sensory mechanism . underpinning this are probably evolved and are almost certainly managing . what we look for and how we respond. Improving chances: Women who were shown images of men wearing the white t-shirt with a large black T were 12 per cent more likely to be attracted to them . ‘The effect was most notable for normal men with a waist as wide as their shoulders. Whereas with those who are already in . good shape, the T was simply amplifying the body shape they already . had, so the benefit was less marked.’ The study involved showing 30 female undergraduates, aged 18 to 25, images of five different male body shapes and asked them to mark their perceived attractiveness and health. Each male model wore a plain white t-shirt with no T, and with an upright and inverted T-illusions of varying shapes and sizes. The results showed that upright T-illusions increased attractiveness and health perceptions. Dr Dunn said the horizontal bar on the T-shirt had to be as equal or longer than the vertical bar for optimum effectiveness. He said: ‘Clearly there are individual tastes and preferences, but we can see here how fashion could have an implicit positive or negative effect on perceived attractiveness and health. ‘It suggests that you can use this kind of optical illusion that artists and fashion designers use all the time to tap into our basic sensory psychology.’","Wearing a white t-shirt with the letter T makes men more attractive .

"Poverty levels in the UK have fallen to levels last seen more than two decades ago, new figures showed today. The number of people in relative poverty has fallen by 100,000 over the past year to 9.7 million. Overall, 15 per cent of people were in relative poverty last year, the lowest level since the 1980s. The official figures were released by the Department for Work and Pensions. They show how relative poverty - measured as living on 60 per cent of median average incomes - has been falling gradually since 2008-09 in the wake of the financial crash. Before housing costs are taken into account, the number of people living below the threshold has fallen by 100,000 over the past year to 9.7 million. In 2007-08 the figure hit 11million. Median incomes remained broadly unchanged between 2011/12 and 2012/13, up £2 to £440 a week for a couple with no children. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said: 'Despite the deepest debt-fuelled recession in living memory when £112 billion was wiped off the economy, we have protected the most vulnerable families from falling behind with 300,000 fewer children in poverty since 2010. 'Today's figures underline the need to stick to the Government's long-term economic plan of restoring a strong economy that creates jobs, and a tax and welfare system that helps people into work and makes work pay.' However, the percentage of people in absolute low income after housing costs has increased slightly to 23 per cent, the highest it has been since 2001-02. Among children, 17 per cent are in relative low income before housing costs, the lowest level since the 1980s, although it has not fallen in the last year. Labour's Rachel Reeves, shadow work and pensions secretary, said: 'These figures show the Government's child poverty strategy is failing abysmally with no progress for the millions of children still living in poverty. 'They also include extremely worrying signs that rising housing costs are set to push more children into poverty and that severe poverty is on the rise.' The Gingerbread campaign group said the statistics also showed a steep rise in child poverty for single parent households where the parent works full-time, climbing from 17 per cent of households where the single parent works full-time in poverty in 2011-12 to 22 per cent in 2012-13. Work and Pensions Secretary Iain Duncan Smith said the figures showed that the government had protected the most vulnerable families from falling behind . Almost one in four children whose single mother or father works full-time is now growing up poor, while nearly one in three with a single parent working part-time is in poverty, said the group. Gingerbread chief executive Fiona Weir said: 'It is deeply concerning that while the economy is on the up, hundreds of thousands of families remain trapped into poverty. 'For far too many single parent families, work offers no real promise of escape from hardship, as today's figures show a rise in working poverty where a single mum or dad is working full-time.' TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: 'Today's figures clearly show why living standards are falling. While wages have stagnated, and benefits and tax credits have been cut, prices have been rising - especially the cost of housing. 'Since the last election a million more adults and half a million more children fell into absolute poverty when housing costs are taken into account. 'Without a major affordable home building programme and action to secure fair wages, this type of poverty will continue to grow.' Julia Unwin, chief executive of the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said: 'Today's figures show that we are not making sufficient progress into tackling high levels of poverty, despite rising employment and economic recovery. 'The return to lasting economic growth and long-term prosperity will be hampered if we fail to address the levels of poverty in the UK. We know that individual policies which tinker around the edges do not reduce poverty. 'We need a comprehensive strategy that gets to grips with low pay, the high cost of essentials and reform to the tax and benefits system to ensure work is a route out of poverty.' Prime Minister David Cameron's official spokesman said: 'Child poverty remains at its lowest level since the 1980s. It has fallen by 300,000 since 2009/10. 'Does the Government want to continue to do more in this area? Of course. 'Absolutely at the heart of improving prosperity across the country and for all is the importance of sticking to the long-term economic plan, because at the heart of dealing with poverty is work.' The spokesman added: 'In terms of wider poverty, the target established under the previous government is one of relative income, and that stands at its lowest level since 1982.'","Number of people in relative poverty fell by 100,000 last year to 9.7 million .

Unwelcome surprise: A couple who returned to their apartment at the 5700 block of 95th Street Southwest on Monday found their love seat, matching chair and other belongings gone . A recliner and TV stand were left in their place. Information on a traffic ticket and pizza receipt left by the alleged thief pointed to the neighbor. The suspect told police he thought the couple had moved and abandoned their furniture. Police say he told them he was drunk when he decided to switch furniture, calling his buddy for help. The alleged thief showed police where the property was and led them to find the living room set which consisted of four pillows, two floor lamps, two end tables, a TV stand and an inflatable couch with an air pump. In addition to the set were three blankets, an iron, a picture with an ornamental frame, a floor fan, the military equipment, a black stand with four shelves and a plastic container with three drawers and various items inside. Police also found a chair, a wall mirror, an ironing board and a box of ladies footwear. Police believe that the thief broke into the apartment via a crawl space and this isn’t the first time someone broke into the property that way.

"Eden Hazard may be the best player in the Premier League ‘by a mile’, according to one full-back tasked with shackling the 23-year-old — but Wales would not swap Gareth Bale for even the most gifted of Belgium’s golden generation. Swansea’s Neil Taylor will face Hazard in an important game on the path to Euro 2016 qualification at the King Baudouin Stadium on Sunday night, aware the Chelsea forward can go past defenders ‘like a ghost’. Belgium forward Eden Hazard attempts an acrobatic volley during training on Saturday . But Taylor says Hazard cannot compare to Bale, who thrives under the Welsh spotlight after dealing with the pressure at Real Madrid. ‘Hazard has developed under Jose Mourinho,’ said Taylor. ‘He’s the best player in the Premier League by a mile, I’d say. Mourinho has done that — he’s on a player if they don’t perform. Hazard is doing it week in, week out. He’s a ball carrier, he can take Chelsea from the edge of their box to the opposition area and go past you like a ghost. He can go outside or inside, shoot, or make you foul him. ‘He’s a great player. But we have one of our own. Of course, I’d always have Gareth in my team before Hazard. No question. I played against him when he was at Spurs, but played with him throughout the Welsh age groups. He is one of those freaks of nature who come along every now and then, technically and athletically. He’s world class like the Messis and Ronaldos. They were born to play football. Hazard will line up for Belgium against Wales in Euro 2016 qualifier on Sunday night . ‘The pressure is on him at Real just to train properly, let alone win every game. He’s matured, and physically grown into a proper man. It seems as if he’s learning off Ronaldo and others at Real, how they work day to day. I’m sure England and other nations wish he was their player. But he’s so proud to be Welsh and he wants to be a part of this squad. He has grown in confidence in the last year. He knows the onus is on him now and that he’s our biggest player.’ Bale did not score in the last two qualifiers against Bosnia and Cyprus, which yielded four points to send Wales top of Group B, but he performed superbly in the absence of Aaron Ramsey and Joe Allen. And it is not just his Welsh team-mates who value Bale — so too do his former colleagues at Tottenham, who Bale left behind when he joined Real for a world-record £86 million fee. Nacer Chadli, who should appear alongside Hazard for Belgium, is having a fine season for Spurs and has scored six Premier League goals but his club have struggled and lie 12th in the table. Premier League stars Romelu Lukaku, Eden Hazard and Marouane Fellaini training on Saturday . ‘I feel like the ghost of Bale is still present at Tottenham,’ he said. ‘That’s not strange when you look at how much he meant to the club and the fans. It’s not easy to replace him.’ Belgium’s Jan Vertonghen, another of Bale’s former club mates, will not be man-marking the Real star. ‘It’s very difficult to mark him,’ he said. ‘You mark him as a team. Space is the most important thing for him so communication is important between our defenders and central midfield. He’s an unbelievable player.’ Bale is under no illusions of the task but he remains confident. He said: ‘They’re fourth in the world so they’re a very good side. We know what qualities they have, but we also know what weaknesses they have. We’ll be giving it our best go and hopefully we’ll get the three points.’ Gareth Bale thrives under the Welsh spotlight after dealing with the pressure at Real Madrid .","Eden Hazard may be the best player in the Premier League ‘by a mile’, says Neil Taylor .

"As a blue and red 16-seater plane accelerated along a runway last month in northern England, there was nothing to suggest its voyage was anything out of the ordinary. But minutes later, as the plane turned north and began a 500-mile round trip from Lancashire to Inverness, history was made. Once the craft was safely at cruising altitude, the pilot flicked a switch and handed over to a trained controller sitting at a computer screen many miles away on the ground. Ambitious: For the first time in aviation history, a 'pilotless' passenger plane was flying over mainland Britain recently. This is a file picture . For the first time in aviation history, a ‘pilotless’ passenger plane was flying over mainland Britain. That concept might make many people uneasy. But, according to the air industry, it is the future of flight. Some predict that within five, ten or 20 years, commercial jets will be flown routinely by remote control over our towns and cities. So will we ever get used to climbing aboard our holiday flight to Cyprus or Greece and, instead of being greeted with a welcome from an upbeat and commanding captain, be met only with an automated message? And those soothing words of reassurance in mid-air as the plane is buffeted through a nasty patch of turbulence? They, too, could soon be a thing of the past. Supporters of so-called ‘autonomous  aircraft’ justify their developments on safety grounds. If most accidents are caused by human error, they argue, then surely it makes sense to remove people from the equation? But the arrival of such craft in our skies raises disturbing questions. Some fear it could make passengers more vulnerable to computer failure and put planes at greater risk of being hijacked by cyber-terrorists hacking into control systems. Bold: Some predict that within five, ten or 20 years, commercial jets will be flown routinely by remote control over our towns and cities . And however much the industry might insist on their absolute safety, how many of us would actually dare to go up in such  an aircraft? Britain and the U.S. have been using unmanned military drone aircraft for years. However, the next generation of pilotless planes are not designed for warfare, but to fly passengers and cargo around the globe. Last month’s test flight over the UK was part of the Astraea project — the £62 million Autonomous Systems Technology Related Airborne Evaluation and Assessment programme funded by industry and the Government. The Astraea team took a standard Jetstream aircraft and added banks of computers, sensors and high definition cameras to turn it into an experimental ‘uninhabited  air vehicle’. The craft — nicknamed the Flying Test Bed — is able to cruise in British airspace with no human involvement, though not yet without any humans on board. The high-definition cameras in the cockpit and underneath the craft scan the skies for weather systems and feed the information back to the computerised navigation system, allowing the craft to change course automatically to avoid storms and turbulence. Meanwhile, cameras are on the look out for mid-air hazards such as other aircraft, weather balloons and even parachutes. Worrying: Criticis say there have been 100 drone crashes since 2007 - including nine since the start of the year. This is a file picture of a drone plane . Again, the computer’s ‘sense and avoid’ technology will adjust the navigation if something is on collision course. Manufacturer BAE Systems boasts it can track up to 20,000 objects simultaneously. The aircraft’s progress is  monitored on the ground by an operator who is sent, via radio and satellite, the images taken by the cameras, and the data from the plane’s sensors. The operator can override the plane’s computers and fly or land the craft by remote control if needed. But if contact is lost — say the signals fail — the plane is programmed to land safely  by itself. It is given potential landing strips — such as playing fields or other flat areas — and uses heat sensors and optical cameras to check if they are free from obstacles or people before landing. Under existing UK aviation rules, the Jetstream is unable to take off and land autonomously. So during the most recent test flight, two pilots sat in the cockpit to control both operations. In between, they sipped cups of coffee. On the outbound flight from Warton Aerodrome in Lancashire the pilots passed control to a ground-based operator once take-off was complete. On the return flight, control was given to the onboard navigation and robotics system. BAE Systems says the technology has been tested on 11 aircraft and on 80 flights over the past year, including a simulated search-and-rescue mission using two unmanned craft. In tests, it was shown to be as effective and safe as a human pilot. The firm believes the pilotless craft could be used within five to ten years for scientific experiments — examining weather or volcanic ash clouds — or search-and-rescue missions. After that, they could be used as cargo planes. The industry believes automated planes will be safer — and will do away with pilot error, a major cause of accidents. Lambert Dopping-Hepenstal, Astraea Programme Director at BAE Systems, says: ‘Unmanned civil aircraft are an exciting new opportunity. We see these aircraft undertaking dangerous roles in poor conditions . . . such as search-and-rescue missions.’ There is no talk yet of introducing it for passenger flights, but that could soon change, especially when you consider that another advantage of abolishing cockpit pilots is that it saves money. One ground-based operator could, in theory, keep an eye on several planes at once. Way forward: Pilots could soon be a thing of the past . And, unlike humans, computers don’t get tired, don’t need lavatory breaks, don’t have unions and don’t need regular rest periods (or get drunk at parties with stewardesses the night before they fly). BAE Systems also points out that aircraft have been controlled by computers for years. On a typical long-distance flight, autopilots fly the plane for between 80 and 90 per cent of the trip. And that’s not just the dull bits in the middle either. Many commercial pilots routinely land at Heathrow with the help of automated systems. Before unmanned craft routinely take to the skies, the flight rules would need to be overhauled. To do that, the industry will need to convince regulators that their automated systems are foolproof. Yet computer software, as we are reminded almost daily, has a nasty habit of going wrong. Last year, a fault in the banking software of NatWest and the Royal Bank of Scotland left many of its 17 million customers unable to check accounts or access money. The bank suffered another, unrelated failure in March. Naturally, the aviation industry insists robotic planes will be packed with safety features. But while automation has — statistically speaking — made flying safer than ever, accidents still happen. On February 25, 2009, a Turkish Airlines Boeing 373 dropped out of the sky short of Amsterdam’s Schiphol Airport, killing nine people, including all three of the cabin crew. The crash was caused by a faulty radio altimeter — a device that monitors a plane’s altitude using radio waves — which also controlled the aircraft’s automatic thrust systems. The auto-thrust wrongly believed the plane was just above the runway and cut power to the engines. The crew tried to regain control, but the automatic systems wouldn’t let them and the plane fell into a field. In the same year, Air France flight 447 crashed into the Atlantic, killing 228 people, after the autopilot switched itself off and the plane stalled at 38,000ft. Chris Cole, who runs the website Drone Wars UK, believes remote-controlled planes are unreliable. He has collated details of around 100 drone crashes since 2007 — including nine since the start of the year. ‘There are huge safety concerns, but the industry likes to play them down,’ he says. ‘The technology they use is akin to wireless technology, and we know how hard it is to stay connected when you  are moving.’ On top of all this is the threat from cyber-jackers. In 2011, Iranians took control of a remotely operated  U.S. Predator spy plane. The Iranian government claimed it was brought down by its ‘cyber warfare unit’, which took over the controls and safely landed it. The idea of terrorists doing  the same to a civilian or cargo jet  is terrifying. And there’s a broader concern to the development of this kind of technology. We don’t just face a future of pilotless planes. Scientists are, for example, developing computer-driven buses, lorries, cars and trains — all on ‘safety grounds’. You don’t have to be a fan of science fiction movies such as The Terminator — in which robots try to take over the world — to feel uneasy about taking away the human element from transport. There are times when the operator of any vehicle has to make a split-second moral decision. A lorry driver may have to choose whether to veer away from a car coming in the opposite direction and plough into a group of pedestrians. Do we really want computers making those choices over life and death? ‘There is this view among engineers that humans are the weakest part of any system and should be removed,’ says Mr Cole. ‘But that’s not the case. Human ethics and morality shouldn’t just be programmed away.’","A ‘pilotless’ passenger plane flew over mainland Britain recently .

"Lee Middleton  escaped and committed an armed robbery after stuffing his bed with pillows so it appeared he was fast asleep . An escaped prisoner terrorised a couple in an armed raid at their home – after stuffing his cell bed with pillows to sneak out of an open jail. Lee Middleton, 32, was serving time for a string of armed robberies when he slipped out of HMP Hewell, leaving officers believing he was still asleep. With an unknown accomplice, he travelled to an address in Coventry, 30 miles from the multi-category 1,261-inmate prison near Redditch, Worcestershire. A court head how the masked men, armed with a knuckle duster and a knife, forced their way inside before Middleton threatened to smash terrified resident Matty Grove’s head in with a brick. They made off with cash, mobile phones and Mr Grove’s £10,000 Audi S3 Quattro following the raid in June but Middleton was caught after a police chase. Jail guards had no idea the violent criminal – classed as ‘dangerous’ by his original trial judge – was missing until police rang to say he was in custody. Lal Amarasinghe, prosecuting, said: ‘The prison did not realise he had left until the police contacted them. He had left his bed with two pillows in it.’ Yesterday Mr Grove, 28, and girlfriend Danielle Ismay told of their shock that Middleton was able to sneak out of prison to commit the crime. Miss Ismay, 23, a receptionist, said: ‘It’s disgusting that he was able to get out of a prison to do this to us, particularly as he had been jailed for other burglaries and violent raids in the first place. ‘We have suffered a horrendous ordeal and were left so fearful of our safety that we had to move house.’ She said they could not believe it when police told them Middleton was a serving prisoner. The couple plan to sue the jail for negligence. Scroll down for video . Pictured is HMP Hewell, from where prisoner Lee Middleton was able to escape by stuffing his bed with pillows . Victims: Matthew Grove and Danielle Ismay (pictured) were at home watching TV when Middleton and his unidentified accomplice broke into their home and threatened them with a knife and knuckle duster . 'It was a horrendous ordeal': Matty Grove, left, and his receptionist girlfriend Danielle Ismay, right . ‘If the prison had done its job and kept Middleton locked up, he would never have been able to burgle us,’ Miss Ismay added. On Tuesday Middleton was jailed at Warwick Crown Court for a total of 11 years and six months after earlier pleading guilty to the aggravated burglary, dangerous driving and driving while disqualified. Judge Sylvia De Bertodano said it was ‘not quite clear’ how he had escaped, but added that it was ‘quite clear’ how dangerous he was. She also told the court: ‘There must have been planning to the extent that someone must have met him (outside the prison) to take him there (to Coventry).’ Middleton had been seen by jail staff at 9.30pm, but at 11.40pm he was outside Mr Grove and Miss Ismay’s house in Coventry. They used the brick to smash a pane on the front door to force their way inside, screaming ‘It’s the police!’ before Middleton began rifling through Miss Ismay’s bag. Mr Grove, who works in logistics at a factory, told the Daily Mail: ‘I stood up to try to stop him emptying the bag, but he had picked up the brick and told me, “Sit down now or I will smash your head in”. It was a really nasty incident.’ Middleton, of Wyken, Coventry, had been given an indeterminate sentence, with a minimum of ten years, in 2007 for armed robberies committed with two accomplices. In one they terrorised a pregnant woman and her children before stealing £40,000 in possessions. Pictured left is prisoner Frank Morris, and right, a dummy found in the bed of his accomplice . Lee Middleton's method of escape from HMP Hewell - by stuffing his bed with pillows to make it appear he was fast asleep - is actually tactic devised in one of the most notorious prison escapes of all time. In 1962 Frank Lee Morris, along with fellow prisoners Clarence and John Anglin, escaped from Alcatraz prison by leaving hand built dummies with human-like heads in their beds to fool the patrolling guards. They then crept out of their cells through tunnels they had spent years digging, before boarding a life raft when they reached the water. Although it's been claimed the three men have been spotted in the years since the prison break, there have been no confirmed sightings of the three and it is likely they all died attempting to make it across San Francisco Bay. In the decades since, the stunt has become one of the most infamous prison tales of all time, due to the fact it was remained the only successful escape from Alcatraz, and its portrayal in Hollywood films including 'Escape from Alcatraz' starring Clint Eastwood.

"This cat had two faces - but only nine lives. A feline named Frank and Louie after he was born with two faces, two mouths, two noses and three blue eyes has died at the age of 15. The Telegram of Worcester reports that 'Frankenlouie' died Thursday at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tufts University in North Grafton. The cat's owner, Marty Stevens, said veterinarians believe the cause of death was cancer. Scroll down for video . R.I.P: 'Frankenlouie', the world's oldest Janus cat - a feline with two faces - died at the age of 15 on Thursday December 4, 2014, after suffering what was believed to be cancer . Rare: The Guinness World Record holder passed away at the Cummings School of Veterinary Medicine at Tuft's University in Grafton, Massachusetts, according to owner Martha 'Marty'Stevens . Precious: Marty Stevens is seen here at home with her beloved cat. She called the face on the left Frank, while the face on the right is identified as Louie . The cat's owner, Marty Stevens, said veterinarians believe the cause of death was cancer. Frank and Louie made it into the 2012 edition of Guinness World Records as the longest-surviving member of a group known as Janus cats, named for a Roman god with two faces. Janus cats almost never survive, and most have congenital defects. They usually only live a few days. A breeder brought the rare feline to Stevens, a vet nurse, to be euthanized in September of 1999. However Stevens, not believing the cat would survive, decided to take him home with her and care for him. She fed Frankenlouie using tubes in both mouths, soon realizing that only the 'Frank' side was connected to his esophagus. He did, however, eat enough for two. Stevens said her cat quickly developed a strong personality and loved to walk around her neighborhood in North Grafton. 'He’s just so affectionate and sweet he usually wins people over,' she told The Telegram-Gazette in 2011. Beloved: The Janus cat was set to be euthanized by a breeder in 1999, but Stevens, a vet nurse, decided to bring him home with her . Fascinating: Frankenlouie was blind in his center eye, but his outer eyes function as per usual . He functioned as a regular cat. While blind in his center eye, both his outer eyes worked fine, and while he had two noses and mouths, he had only one brain. Stevens is now understandably devastated to lose her pet of 15 years. She said her fell quite ill around Thanksgiving and she she took him to the Tuffs University clinic. The vet told her it was best to euthanize him, because he was in quite a lot of pain. Stevens says once her sadness passes she wouldn't mind looking for another Janus to bring home with her, just like she did with Frankenlouie in 1999. 'I would love to do it again,' she said.","Frank and Louie - 'Frankenlouie' - was brought to Tuffs University in North Grafton by a breeder in September 1999 to be euthanized .

"These are the 'Ghost' killer thugs pumped up on steroids who are proving key to keeping Syria's brutal President Bashar Assad in power. Covered in tattoos of images of their leader, they are blamed for roaming the nation massacring children and women by slitting their throats or shooting them at point-blank range. Wielding AK-47s and machetes, they are said to carry out the government's dirty work so officials can claim the rampages are not being sponsored by the state. Pumped up: Areen Al Assad, with a tattoo of Bashar Assad on his bicep, is said to be one of the 'Ghost' killers roaming Syria . Meat-head: Known as the 'Shabiha', they wear combat trousers and black t-shirts and are paid the massive sum of £130 per day . Known as the 'Shabiha', translating to 'Ghosts', they wear combat trousers and black t-shirts and are paid the massive sum of £130 per day. Their modus operandi sees them swarm in to towns after the army has stopped shelling. A source said: 'Their mission is to terrorise the civilian population and conduct ethnic cleansing.' A massacre of 108 civilians in Houla two weeks ago, including 49 children, has been blamed on the group who fanatically follow the Muslim Alawite sect. They are also reported to have shot dead 12 workers in Qusayr and 78 villagers in Qubair last week. Messing about: The 'Ghosts' modus operandi sees them swarm in to towns after the army has stopped shelling . Muscle man: Emergence of the death squad pictures comes after William Hague said yesterday he may have to send troops to Syria if the country spirals into a  Bosnian-style civil war . Dr Mousab Azzawi, who runs the Syrian . Network for Human Rights from London but had treated some of the Shabiha . in Latakia, said recently: 'They were like monsters. 'They . had huge muscles, and big bellies and beards. They took steroids to . pump up their bodies. I had to talk to them like children as they like . people with low intelligence. Syria's large chemical weapons stocks could be trained on Israel, the latter's deputy military chief has warned. According to Maj. Gen. Yair Naveh, Syria has the largest arsenal of chemical weapons in the world. If the Syrians had the chance, he said, they would 'treat us the same way they treat their own people'. Syria has not declared its chemical weapons stocks so their exact size is not known. Among other things, Israel is worried that such weapons could fall into the hands of anti-Israel militants should the Syrian regime crumble. Israeli radio stations and newspapers carried Naveh's remarks today. He delivered them Sunday night at a ceremony in Jerusalem commemorating fallen soldiers. Syrian activists estimate more than 13,000 people have died since an uprising against the Syrian regime erupted 15 months ago, drawing a bloody crackdown. Israel has been watching the carnage in neighboring Syria with increasing concern. The two countries have fought major wars and multiple attempts to reach a peace deal failed. Syria has strong ties to Iran, Israel's most fearsome enemy, and to Palestinian and Lebanese militants that have warred with Israel. 'That is what makes them so terrifying — the combination of strength and blind allegiance to the regime.' Emergence of the death squad pictures . comes after William Hague said yesterday he may have to send troops to . Syria if the country spirals into a  Bosnian-style civil war. The . Foreign Secretary said Britain would have to 'greatly increase our . support for the opposition' if the current United Nations plan for a . ceasefire fails, as his office now fears. Mr Hague repeatedly refused to rule out military action yesterday if Syria descends into 'terrible' sectarian violence. And he twice compared the violence raging in the Arab state to the conflict in Bosnia, where 12,000 British soldiers were eventually sent, rather than Libya, where the Government resisted sending in ground troops. Mr Hague told the BBC: 'The reason I don’t rule things out is because we really don't know now how this situation is going to develop or how terrible it is going to become. 'Increasingly the analogy is not with Libya last year but with Bosnia in the 1990s. 'We are on the edge of that kind of sectarian murder on a large scale. So who knows what may be required from the international community to try to deal with that, if it gets going in that way.' As violence continued to rage yesterday, claiming at least 38 lives, Mr Hague reiterated his message on Sky News. He said Syria is now 'on the edge of a sectarian conflict in which neighbouring villages are attacking and killing each other so I don’t think we can rule anything out'. The Foreign Secretary's words will fuel concerns that Britain risks being sucked into another Middle East war with potentially devastating political and humanitarian consequences. Enforcers: Film footage shows the 'Ghosts' walking out and about . Action man: Pictured with guns, the Ghost poses for this photograph . But some diplomats believe the West will be compelled to act if the situation deteriorates and risks dragging in neighbouring countries such as Lebanon and Turkey. Security sources said one scenario under discussion would see troops deploy to protect aid convoys entering Syria, a task Western soldiers also carried out in the early years of the Bosnian war. Mr Hague gave credence to that theory by stressing the problems of providing aid to Syria yesterday. 'One of the great difficulties here is getting aid to them where fighting is going on and where the regime doesn’t provide access,' he said. The UK has already provided £8.5million of medical supplies and emergency aid via international agencies. Battered: The Ghosts filmed beating activists . Violence: A massacre of 108 civilians in Houla two weeks ago, including 49 children, has been blamed on the group who fanatically follow the Muslim Alawite sect . Mr Hague said he 'welcomed in principle' a Russian proposal for an international conference on Syria, but warned it must 'lead to a change and not just buy time for the regime to kill more people'. He said it would be hard to see how Iran could attend the conference - one of Russia's demands - as it had already given Syria technical support and advised the regime on how to suppress protests. Instead, he said the way forward was to adopt the peace plan of former United Nations secretary-general Kofi Annan. Most diplomats, however, believe that plan is dead in the water, and the Foreign Secretary conceded: ‘Every other solution to the Syrian crisis involves a lot more death.’ Today Syrian troops attacked a rebel-held town in the centre of the country with helicopter gunships and shelled other restive areas across the country, activists said. The aerial assault targeted the strategic river crossing town of Rastan that has resisted repeated government offensives for months, they added. It is part of an escalation of violence in recent weeks that comes despite an internationally-brokered cease-fire that was supposed to go into effect on April 12 but never took hold. Destruction: Syrians sit next to a damaged house at the northern town of Ariha, on the outskirts of Idlib, yesterday . Patrol: Syrian troops deployed in Duma, in a suburb of Damascus . 'The regime is now using helicopters more after its ground troops suffered major losses,' said Rami Abdul-Rahman of the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. 'Dozens of vehicles have been destroyed or damaged since the end of May.' Syria's Foreign Ministry spokesman Jihad Makdissi recently said rebels are now using sophisticated anti-tank missiles. Videos posted by activists over the past week have shown many destroyed tanks and armored personnel carriers. The Observatory and the Local Coordination Committees also reported government shelling in the central provinces of Homs and Hama, the southern region of Daraa, the northern province of Aleppo, and suburbs of the capital Damascus and Deir el-Zour in the east. The Observatory reported the deaths of four civilians and an army defector in shelling in the area of Ashara in Deir el-Zour, and said another eight unidentified bodies had been discovered nearby. It reported three dead in the Hama shelling. In Moscow, the Foreign Ministry said Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov will visit Iran on Wednesday. Russia and Iran are Syrian President Bashar Assad's strongest allies. Moscow and China have vetoed two Security Council resolutions that threatened possible sanctions against Syria. The ministry said in a statement that Russia is not playing the role of advocate for certain Middle East regimes. 'We are speaking for the strict observance of the norms and principles of international law in the interest of supporting regional stability and security in the Near and Middle East and North Africa,' it said. Syrian activists say the violence has claimed the lives of more than 13,000 people.  UNICEF Executive Director Anthony Lake said on the killings of children in Syria: 'How many more children need to die? 'Repeated calls for the protection of children by all parties in Syria have not yielded positive action. But we must voice again our outrage when seeing the murder of innocents, especially children and women, as reportedly the case in Al-Qubair village in Hama. 'UNICEF appeals once more: spare and protect the children who are in no way responsible for the violence and must not be its victims.'","They wield AK-47s and machetes to carry out the government's dirty work .

"Masked gunmen dragged Syria's best-known political cartoonist from his car before dawn, broke both his hands and left him bleeding along the side of a road days after he compared Syria's president to Moammar Gaddafi. Ali Ferzat, 60, who had made stinging drawings of Bashar al-Assad, 45, was grabbed yesterday when he left his artist's studio in Damascus, the second-largest city in the Middle East country. Hospitalised with serious injuries, Mr Ferzat appears to have become the most famous victim of the repression of Syria's five-month uprising - a stark reminder that no Syrian is immune to the government crackdown. The artist, who has earned international acclaim for his caricatures of leaders in the Arab world, such as Saddam Hussein and Colonel Gaddafi,  was dumped on a road outside the city. Scroll down to see video of the cartoonist in hosptial . Beaten: The 60-year-old cartoonist was attacked by masked gunmen when he left his studio on Thursday . Bloodied: The 60-year-old cartoonist remained in hospital overnight after four masked gunmen attacked him . The attack came as forces . loyal to president Assad, who has been in charge of the country since 2000, killed eight people across Syria . overnight, in a sustained campaign to re-establish his authority. The protests against his power, which he inherited from his disliked father, have been ongoing for five months, and after seeing the demise of Colonel Gaddafi's reign in Libya he critics believe he is re-asserting his power by attacking those who are against him. In an interview with state television . broadcast on Sunday, Assad said he was responding to armed unrest and . that he would not bow to Western pressure because 'reform for . colonialist states among the West means to offer them all what they want . and sell out all rights'. This cartoon, published earlier in the week, shows Assad attempting to hitch a lift from Colonel Gaddafi, the tyrannical Libyan leader . One of the cartoonist's pictures shows president Assad offering a man being beaten by his troops a cup of tea .

And Today Assad's troups fired at protesters after Friday prayers in the Damascus suburb of Douma . 'Protesters phoned in to say that two people have been killed, but this is an initial report still to be confirmed,' an activist in Damascus said. Other activists and residents reported protests in cities and towns, many of which have been stormed by tanks, stretching from Deir al-Zor province in the east to Deraa in the south to the northwest province of Idlib. Meanwhile, Mr Ferzat lay badly bruised in a hospital bed last night with his hands swathed in bandages. He recalled the gunmen telling him that 'this is just a warning' as they beat him, according to a relative. 'We will break your hands so that you'll stop drawing,' the masked men said, according to the relative. Mr Ferzat, who usually works late . into the night, left his studio at 4am in the early hours of Thursday, . but a jeep with tinted windows quickly cut him off, according to the . relative. Four masked gunmen then dragged him . out of his car, bundled him into the jeep and drove him to the airport . road just outside Damascus, beating him and making threats all the . while. The men then singed the artist's beard, put a bag over his head and dumped him on the side of the road. One of the cartoonist's pictures shows president Assad offering a man being beaten by his troops a cup of tea. Another shows a gunman scribbling out the word 'democracy' and replacing it with 'bloodocracy'. A third - which was published earlier this week - depicts the president with his thumb out, trying to hitch a lift from Colonel Gaddafi, who is seen to be fleeing Libya. 'They broke his hands in the most . disgusting and deplorable way to send a message,' said U.S. State . Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland of the attack. 'It's not only Ali Ferzat that we're . worried about. The regime has also locked up a number of other prominent . dissidents to send a message.' President Assad, who inherited the Syrian leadership in 2000 and is pictured speaking on Thursday in Damascus, used to encourage the cartoonist . Before inheriting Syria's presidency from his father in 2000, Bashar Assad, a British-trained eye doctor, used to visit Mr Ferzat's exhibitions and offer encouraging words, the artist has said. When the new president opened Syria to reforms, Mr Ferzat was allowed to publish the country's first private newspaper in decades, a satirical weekly called The Lamplighter. The paper was an instant hit, with copies of each issue selling out a few hours after hitting the stands. Anti-Assad supporters pictured on Thursday in Casablanca . It was soon shut down, however, as Assad began cracking down on dissent and jailing critics after the brief, heady period known as the Damascus Spring quickly lost steam. Mr Ferzat became a vehement critic of the regime, particularly after the military launched a brutal crackdown on the country's protest movement. His illustrations grew bolder in . recent months, with some of his cartoons directly criticizing Assad, . even through caricatures of the president are forbidden in Syria. Human rights groups said Assad's forces have killed more than 2,000 people since the uprising against his autocratic rule erupted in mid-March, touched off by the wave of revolutions sweeping the Arab world. Assad's crackdown has not spared other Syrian intellectuals and artists who dared to voice criticism. A group of intellectuals and artists, including Syrian actress May Skaff, were rounded up and jailed for a week last month after holding a protest in Damascus. And Damascus-based activist and film producer Shadi Abu Fakher went missing on July 23 and has not been heard of since. Mr Ferzat, however, is the most famous victim of the repression to date. He had been encouraging other Syrian artists to side with the protesters, even publishing on his website a 'List of Shame' that included names of those who were on the side of the regime. 'We were a group of reformers in the country, and suddenly, the doors of hell opened on us. It was a huge disappointment,' Mr Ferzat said earlier this month. 'There are two things in this life that cannot be crushed - the will of God and the will of the people.'","'We will break your hands so that you'll stop drawing'

"The European Space Agency's orbiting telescope has captured striking new images of the huge 'Doomsday' asteroid Apophis that could smash into Earth in 2036 - revealing it is larger than previously thought. Long billed as a potential cause of an Extinction Level Event (ELE) for humanity, today ESA officials announced that its Herschel Space Observatory discovered that the asteroid is 1,066 feet wide, 20 percent larger than the previous estimate of 885 feet. Whizzing past Earth at the relatively close distance of nine million miles tonight, Apophis is being closely tracked because of a 2004 study that predicted the rock has a 2.7 percent chance of hitting Earth in April 2029, which was later revised to 2036. ESAs Herschel Space Observatory captured asteroid Apophis in its field of view during the approach to Earth on January, 5-6, 2013. This image shows the asteroid in Herschels three PACS wavelengths: 70, 100 and 160 microns . 'The 20 percent increase in diameter … translates into a 75 percent increase in our estimates of the asteroid's volume or mass,' study leader Thomas Müller of the Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics in Garching, Germany, said in a statement. In addition to the latest findings two free webcasts will stream live views of the asteroid as it passes, filmed from telescopes in Italy and the Canary Islands. The video streams from Slooh Space Telescope and Virtual Telescope Project will show Apophis as a moving light streaking across the sky - although scientists have said that sadly the large space rock is too small to be seen through home telescopes. 'Alone among all these near-Earth asteroids that have passed our way in recent years, Apophis has generated the most concern worldwide because of its extremely close approach in 2029 and [chances of a] potential impact, albeit small, in 2036,' said Slooh president Patrick Paolucci. Indeed, while scientists have ruled out any possibility of a cataclysmic collision - there remains a very real chance of the asteroid Apophis smashing into Earth in 2036. 'Apophis has been one of those celestial bodies that has captured the public's interest since it was discovered in 2004,' said Steve Chesley at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California. Jan. 8, 2013: At about 36 hours from the minimum distance (9.3 million miles from Earth), potentially hazardous asteroid Apophis was imaged again with the Virtual Telescope . 'Updated computational techniques and newly available data indicate the probability of an Earth encounter on April 13, 2036, for Apophis has dropped from one-in-45,000 to about four-in-a million.' The science of predicting asteroid orbits is based on a physical model of the solar system which includes the gravitational influence of the sun, moon, other planets and the three largest asteroids. NASA detects and tracks asteroids and comets passing close to Earth using both ground and space-based telescopes. The Near Earth-Object Observations Program, commonly called 'Spaceguard,' discovers these objects, characterizes a subset of them and plots their orbits to determine if any could be potentially hazardous to our planet. This year Apophis, named after an Egyptian mythological demon, will not get closer than around nine million miles. Doomsday Asteroid? An artist's rendering of the asteroid Apophis as created by the European Space Agency . Experts say the impact if Apophis struck the Earth would generate a blast equivalent to more than 500 megatons of TNT . Scientists will use the encounter to improve their estimate of just how dangerous the space rock really is to life on Earth. In 2029, Apophis is expected to come uncomfortably close, brushing past the Earth at a distance of just 30,000 kilometres. That will put the asteroid inside the orbit of communication satellites. Current models predict a tiny but real likelihood of Apophis colliding with the Earth in 2036. When the asteroid was discovered in 2004 scientists calculated a one-in-45 chance of an impact in 2029. Improved predictions later lifted the threat. The asteroid's latest near approach will occur at midnight UK time tomorrow. Members of the public can view the event online via the Slooh web-based sky-watching service, which collects images from observatories around the world. 'We are excited to cover this asteroid live for the general public.' Scientists at the American space agency Nasa have calculated that if Apophis struck the Earth it would generate a blast equivalent to more than 500 megatons of TNT. In comparison, the most powerful hydrogen bomb ever detonated, the Soviet Tsar Bomba, released 57 megatons.","1000 foot wide asteroid will brush past the Earth at a distance of 30,000km .

"The future looks bright for Facebook, or at least brighter now that Mark Zuckerberg has released a new map with all the friends connected through the site across the world represented by shining points of light. Countries worldwide are bathed in blue on the striking map, and far more users are represented than were on a similar map released in 2010. The map shows the rising popularity of the social media site in Africa, South America, and India. But it has one undeniably black hole: it sits directly over the nation of China. September 2013: Mark Zuckerberg has proudly made this map his Facebook page's new cover photo. It shows how all the world is connected through the social media behemoth .

Blue planet: According to Facebook, over a billion users logged on to the social media site each month in 2013, up 23 percent from 2012 . As noted by Slate, the People’s Republic is no big fan of Facebook. The communist government has blocked Facebook for years—blaming it, at least in part, on the riots in Urumqi that left 140 dead in 2009—along with Twitter, Youtube, and other sites. Instead of Facebook, Chinese internet users interested in social media log onto the sites Weibo, Weixin, and Renren. Also a dark spot, on both the new and old Facebook connection maps, is the Dark Continent. Africa’s more populous coastal and southern regions are alight, but no connections are leaping out of the continent’s center. Telecom infrastructure here is far less developed, though tech giants like Facebook and Google are working to change that. Russia is another dark area on the map, though that’s owed less to a restrictive government and more to its citizen’s preferences. Facebook is only the second most used social network in Mother Russia after the more popular Vkontakte. While the darker areas of Facebook’s maps have remained relatively unchanged, many of the brighter spots have become even more so. The booming economy of India has no doubt fueled its increased connections on Facebook. Brazil, another rapidly industrializing country, has also increased its Facebook use, despite the longstanding popularity of Google’s Orkut in the South American nation. While Facebook may not be breaking into the Chinese market, just a glance at these maps makes it clear that the site’s popularity is on the rise worldwide and won’t be going away any time soon.","A map using points of blue light to show how Facebook connections across the globe shows a jump in users in India, Africa, and South America .

"Criticism: Headteacher Lyn Corderoy has flown off to Ghana to teach literacy skills to children during term time . A headteacher has been criticised for taking the 'appalling' decision to go to Africa for almost a month during term-time. Lyn Corderoy, headteacher at Grange Primary School in Wickford, Essex, has flown off to Ghana despite parents facing a £60 fine for unauthorised absence during term-time. Her school, which is rated good by Ofsted but its pupils are below average for English, is taking part in a project to help children in Africa with literacy. Last year only 65 per cent of her pupils attained the desired national standard for grammar, punctuation and spelling. Parents have turned on Miss Corderoy, who is taking the time as unpaid leave and accused of 'double standards'. In Essex, where the school is, more than 500 people a year are fined in this way. But the school have said her trip is 'vitally important'. Susan Godfrey, 46, from Wickford, said: 'I think it's absolutely appalling. 'How is the headteacher allowed to go away for such a long time during term-time? There are parents waiting on decisions she has made and she is not even there.' Charlotte Worton, 26, from Pitsea, Essex, added: 'I think it's absolutely unfair headteachers can go in term-time. 'It's unfair on the children. Their job is to look after the children during the term time. If they take time off, they're neglecting the children.' Alan Ball, local UKIP councillor, said he also had concerns about the decision. He said: 'I have not been made aware of it but it seems to be double standards. 'If you are not allowed to take children out of school and the headteacher disappears for a month, it seems to be double standards to me. 'If the head goes away for a month someone has to cover for the headteacher and it will have a knock-on effect on the pupils eventually. 'It must have, unless they are bringing in someone else at the taxpayers' cost. 'I don't know the situation, but on the face of it, I would have concerns.' Anger: Parents of children at  Grange Primary School in Wickford, Essex, said the decision to let the headteacher go is 'appalling' Announcement: Miss Corderoy's time away was announced in the school newsletter last month . Wickford Ukip councillor Nigel Le Gresley said: 'It does to a certain extent smack of double standards, not least because it could perhaps have been done in term time'. Parents have accused Miss Corderoy of double standards because they can be fined for taking their children on a term-time holiday. Previously, head teachers had the discretion to allow pupils up to 10 days of leave from school each year. However, under new measures brought in by former Education Secretary Michael Gove, children can only be taken out of school in 'exceptional circumstances'. Parents who take their children out of school without authorisation, they can face a fine of £60 for every child. Those who refuse to pay can be prosecuted, fined £2,500 and even face jail. In Essex, where Miss Corderoy's school is, more than 500 people a year are fined in this way. News of the headteacher's absence was announced in last month's school newsletter under the headline 'Being a Learning School'. The short explanation stated: 'I'm sure you will agree with the governors and staff that sharing our good learning and teaching practice with other schools and students is vitally important. 'We support learning in many different ways and after half term the school governors have given Miss Corderoy an unpaid secondment to work on the Let's Read phonic project. 'This is an exciting opportunity to share our school's phonic learning skills. 'Mr Hazelgrove will be acting head for the three weeks she is away.' A spokesman for Essex County Council defended the decision saying: 'The headteacher is not on leave and this is not a personal project. 'She is on an unpaid professional secondment that will benefit the children's learning. 'Ghanaian teachers have previously visited Grange to help the children learn about other cultures.' A spokesman for the school governors added: 'The preparation cover arrangements put in place have meant that the good-quality of education and service at the school has been maintained.' Last month a headteacher was branded a 'hypocrite' after she booked a Caribbean holiday for during term time only to cave in to pressure from parents and cancel it. Jenny Winder, 53, head of Elstow Primary School near Bedford, had wanted a week off after the Christmas holidays ended for an exotic beach break. This was despite it being after the start of school term and parents being told in no uncertain terms that they cannot take their children out of lessons. After days of pressure Bedford Borough Council confirmed Mrs Winder has 'cancelled the proposed leave and will be in work from the start of the new spring term on the January 5, 2015'. Earlier  parent governor Reverend Jeremy Crocker called on Mrs Winder to cancel her holiday and apologise because her proposed holiday was blatant 'double standards'. He also said she sent a letter to parents falsely claiming her holiday was 'unanimously' backed by governors like him. Her school, which she has run for 14 years, warns had parents who take their children out of school during term time facing fines of £60 per child for unauthorised absences. Mrs Winder had refused to give an explanation or apologise for trying to take the time off. She said: 'My private life is exactly what it says - private.'","Lyn Corderoy's trip to Africa has upset parents at Grange Primary in Essex .

"CLICK HERE to read the full match report with all the pictures from Wembley . Danny Welbeck cannot wait to play in the 'unbelievable' Celtic Park atmosphere as England look to continue their fine recent run against Scotland. The Three Lions travel north of the border for the first time since 1999 on Tuesday, when international football's oldest rivals meet for the 112th time. The occasion may only be a friendly but the atmosphere inside Celtic Park will be anything but. Danny Welbeck is looking forward to playing at Celtic Park after starring in England's victory over Slovenia . The Arsenal forward watches the ball into the net for his second goal in England's 3-1 victory at Wembley . The Glasgow roar is something Welbeck is looking forward to, with the Arsenal forward confident England will flourish rather than wilt in the hothouse. 'Obviously it is only a friendly but we want to win every single game,' he said. 'We can't go in thinking we are going to do anything else than that. 'It is going to be a great atmosphere. I watched the game against the Republic of Ireland the other night and the atmosphere sounded unbelievable. I just can't wait to get out there and taste it.' Welbeck's opening goal was a scuffed shot, but gave his side the lead for the first time in the game . Welbeck is congratulated by teammate Kieran Gibbs as his hot scoring streak for England continues . As well as bragging rights, Tuesday's match offers England the opportunity to maintain momentum. Emotions remain raw following the World Cup embarrassment, yet Roy Hodgson's men have responded impressively to that disappointment. Saturday's 3-1 win against Slovenia made it five wins on the bounce since Brazil, keeping their 100 per cent start to Euro 2016 qualifying intact. Welbeck's brace complemented a penalty from centurion Wayne Rooney in that win at Wembley, where England recovered impressively from falling behind to a second-half Jordan Henderson own goal. 'It was a good night all round,' Welbeck said. 'It is obviously pleasing to get the win in the end. 'The most important thing was the way the team responded to going a goal down. 'I think what we can do now obviously is play our game and make sure we are prepared for the next match. 'I can't really go back too much to the summer. We can't change anything from there now, so the most important thing is to prepare well for the next game and obviously try to get the win.'

Welbeck may have scored twice but he is all too aware that he was never going to outshine Rooney on such a momentous occasion. The 29-year-old became the youngest-ever English centurion on Saturday, leading the comeback against Slovenia by earning the penalty from which he then levelled. 'Obviously everyone is very pleased for Wayne,' his former Manchester United team-mate Welbeck said. England have moved six points clear in Euro 2016 qualifying Group E . 'In a way it was kind of inevitable he was going to score that goal. 'Once the penalty came around, you just knew he was going to stick it in the back of the net. 'It was great for him to get the goal on his 100th cap, captaining the team.' The win against Slovenia continues England's seemingly unstoppable march towards Euro 2016. Despite only being four games into Group E, their 12-point haul is twice as much as Slovenia, Switzerland and Lithuania in joint-second place. England are virtually guaranteed of reaching the Euro finals after going six points clear in their group . Roy Hodgson applauds after seeing his side continue their impressive response to failure at the World Cup . The top two automatically qualify for the finals and the third-placed side can also progress, yet Welbeck insists qualification is not a formality. 'No, I think we've got to obviously prepare for each and every single game,' he said. 'Every team is going to come to Wembley and try to make it difficult for us. 'Slovenia did that in the first half and we had to kind of change up the tactics a little bit. 'We worked on that throughout the week and in the second half we created some decent chances and put them away.'","England travel to Scotland for an international friendly on Tuesday .

"A great white shark heading for British waters could be bringing some smaller ferocious fish with her, scientists have revealed. The deadly predator – named Lydia – became the first tagged great white shark to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and scientists charting her progress have now revealed that the 15ft shark might be swimming towards Europe to give birth to pups. She is just 800 miles (1,255km) off the coast of Cornwall and Ireland in the Atlantic Ocean and has now turned away from the UK. Scroll down for video . The great white sharked named Lydia has travelled 313 miles in the past 72 hours. She is currently headed west (pictured) But experts believe the shark is pregnant and in search of a nursery for her pups and could be en route to the Mediterranean . Very little is known about the reproduction of great white sharks. Great white sharks are thought to reach sexual maturity aged around 15. The oldest female ever recorded was 40 years old. The predators are ovoviviparous which means that eggs develop and hatch in the uterus and continue to develop until birth. The great white shark has an 11 month gestation period and the pups' jaws start to form at one month. Unborn sharks feed on ova produced by the mother and are born in spring and summer. Mother sharks typically give birth to between two and 12 pups. But experts think she may be aiming for Turkey in search of a nursery in the long-run. Lydia, who weighs 2,000lb (907kg) has covered more than 19,400 miles in the past year since being fitted with a tracking device. She is being tracked as part of a ground-breaking marine life study by Osearch that aims to learn more about sharks' movements. Scientists have been following the ferocious fish for over a year and her progress can be followed on the project’s website. ‘Lydia pinged in this morning headed NW!’ researchers tweeted this morning. Experts say they are shocked by Lydia’s recent dash towards Europe and she has travelled 313 miles in the past 72 hours. Chris Fischer, expedition leader and founding chairman of the Ocearch shark tagging project, said Lydia may be looking for somewhere to rear young. He said: ‘I would guess that Lydia is pregnant and that she has been out in the open ocean gestating her babies and that this spring she will lead us to where those baby white sharks are born - the nursery.’ He thinks her chosen location may end up being off the coast of Turkey. Record breaker: The deadly predator has become the first tagged shark of its species to cross the Mid Atlantic Ridge, an enormous underwater mountain range under the ocean. She is currently swimming to the west (pictured) Deadly cargo: Tagging the shark (pictured) was a feat in itself, with heavy machinery used to hoist Lydia from the water in order to fit the tracking device . The Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) is a ridge found along the floor of the Atlantic Ocean. This rift marks the actual boundary between adjacent tectonic plates, where magma from the mantle reaches the seafloor, erupting as lava and producing new crustal material for the plates. It forms part of the longest mountain range in the world and separates the Eurasian Plate and North American Plate in the North Atlantic, and the African Plate from the South American Plate in the South Atlantic. Great White Sharks normally give birth to between two and 12 pups at a time after a gestation period of 11 months. Blood samples didn't show Lydia was pregnant when researchers used a 34,000kg hydraulic platform to hoist her from the water to fit her tracking device. But Mr Fischer, who has led numerous ocean expeditions, said there is uncertainty over how exactly Great Whites reproduce. ‘The sperm from the male comes in a packet with a shell on it. They [the female sharks] can carry it around for a while until a special organ inside them breaks down the shell and they get pregnant. ‘We know its 18 months from when we discover the breeding aggregation to when they lead us to the nursery. ‘What we don't know is how long they carry that sperm packet and how long is it until their body breaks down the shell.’ Lydia had been heading north but made a sharp turn back towards the U.S. Ladbrokes bookkeepers revealed odds of 2-1 for Lydia visiting Cornwall as her first port of call. Lydia has become the first tagged great white to cross the Mid Atlantic Ridge (pictured) - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American Plates - at around 10am on March 9 . Her GPS tag only gives off a signal when she's near the water's surface so scientists sometimes have to wait days between new readings. Mr Fischer said it was impossible to predict where she'll head next. He said: ‘If you forced me to guess where that was, I'd say it was over in the Mediterranean, near Turkey - but that's long-ball I'm playing. ‘She could turn around right now and head back to Florida.’ She became the first tagged great white to cross the Mid-Atlantic Ridge - an underwater mountain range which separates the Eurasian and North American tectonic plates - on the morning of March 9. Great whites are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the Gulf coast and Hawaii. Shark biologist Ian Fergusson tweeted: ‘WhiteShark Lydia pinged in on the other side of MidAtlanticRidge! Welcome to the history books, #Lydia,’ while Chris Fischer, who is involved in the project, tweeted: '#Lydia turns E toward #UK continuing first doc Trans/Atl migration n hist!’ Lydia was tagged by the Ocearch project, which aims to monitor sharks to learn more about their movements . Dr Gregory Skomal, 52, senior fisheries biologist with Massachusetts Marine Fisheries, said: ‘I have no idea what to expect from her . next. I've been working with sharks for a very long time now and I have . never seen anything like this.' ‘It's anyone's guess where she is going to go next but she has been heading east so she might continue to do so.’ ‘She's just short of 800 miles away from your coast now but in the grand scheme of things that really isn't far for her. It's all very exciting. ‘It's hard to say how long it might take her to get there. If she decides she wants to get to England she could get there in days. ‘Having said that, she is quite likely to meander. It could take her days, it could take her months, or it might not happen at all. ‘I think it would be great to see her turn up in the UK though.’ Though Lydia's journey is impressive, great whites are known for their marathon migrations. In 2003 a great white nicknamed Nicole travelled from South Africa to Australia and back - some 12,400 miles. In recent years there have been several sightings of Great whites off the coast of Britain. In September last year, fisherman David Bond said he had spotted a 14ft beast swimming close to his boat off the coast of Looe in southern Cornwall. The suspected sighting came just a day after a fisherman on board a lobster boat said he spotted a 'giant shark' get close to his vessel. All those who witnessed the shark dismissed the idea it could be a basking shark, saying the creature was much larger, prompting experts to consider the possibility it was a great white. Great white sharks are the largest predatory fish in the world, reaching up to 20ft in length and more than 4,400lb in weight. Satellite tracking of the giant species has afforded researchers and scientists more accurate information about their habits and long-distance journeys. The OCEARCH Global Shark Tracker Project has tagged around 100 sharks since 2009. The study has shown that Great whites can travel up to 3,000 miles in three months. They . are traditionally tracked off the coasts of South Africa, Australia, . New Zealand, the west coast of America from California up to Alaska, the . Gulf coast and Hawaii. The . creatures have a ferocious reputation but are responsible for between a . third and a half of the average 100 shark attacks across the world each . year. They are highly adapted predators, detecting a single drop of blood in 100 litres of water up to three miles away. Their mouths are lined with around 300 serrated teeth, arranged across several rows. Gathering . speed and approaching their prey from beneath, Great whites can leap . clear of the water, breaching like whales to attack. They commonly feed on sea lions, seals, small toothed whales, and sea turtles. The predators live for up to 25 years and eat around 11 tonnes of food each year. If food is scarce, the sharks will try to avoid fighting, instead engaging in a tail-slapping contest along the surface of the water. The winner delivers the most slaps. Scientists . do not have a reliable idea of the species' population across the . world, but agree their number are decreasing due to overfishing and . sharks being caught accidentally in nets. They are listed as an endangered species.","On Friday, Lydia was spotted 1,000 miles from Cornwall and Ireland .

"Steven Gerrard is haunted by that momentary slip three matches from the end of last season which pulled the Anfield turf out from under Liverpool as Premier League champions-elect. Given time to reflect plus the priceless gift of hindsight, his most vital loss of footing can now be seen as his stumbling failure nine years earlier to drive through a transfer to Liverpool’s opponents on that fateful April afternoon. Chelsea, who capitalised on that rare Gerrard error to both defeat Liverpool and deflate their title challenge, had made a £32million bid for him in the summer of 2005. Steven Gerrard checks his studs after slipping against Chelsea at Anfield last season . Gerrard lifts the European Cup in 2005 after the greatest night of his professional career . That came just six weeks after he captained Liverpool to the greatest comeback in Champions League final history, that epic victory over AC Milan from 3-0 down in Istanbul. Liverpool instantly rejected Chelsea’s offer. But Gerrard, although still only 25, was already suspecting that if he was ever to win a Premier League title it would have to be with a different team. Sadly, he has been proved right. In fact the drama and emotion of that astonishing night on the banks of the Bosphorous had brought him only temporary relief from that sense of foreboding, which had been nagging at him since Liverpool finished 30 points off the pace the preceding season. So he asked for a transfer. Coming from a very local hero, that request was perceived as heresy by the Liverpool faithful and they took to burning replicas of his shirt in the streets. As the protests reached a crescendo their Stevie G relented. Instead of insisting on his right to join the then-reigning League champions at Stamford Bridge, he signed a new £100,000 a week contract. The rest, as we always say, is history. Except that for Gerrard  it is not historic. Since 2005 he and Liverpool have won just one FA Cup and one League Cup – and still no Premier League medal for this valiant war-horse for whom the championship of England has been the Holy Grail since he signed for the club round the corner from his house at the age of eight. Nor is he likely to get one now. Chelsea, in that time, have won their first Champions League, four FA Cups, one League Cup, the Europa League once… and that Premier League title which Gerrard so covets, not once but twice. John Terry lifts the Premier League trophy in 2010 - it is an honour that has eluded Gerrard . Right now they lead the championship race by more points than Liverpool can remotely hope to retrieve and Gerrard is in his Last Chance Saloon, with the light fading. Ah, what might have been. Perhaps a life in English football would have been impossible for him, given how threatening the passions on Merseyside would have remained had he left the club for which he was born to play. But for whatever reason he let his heart over-rule his head, these subsequent nine years have been overflowing from midfield with his commitment to a great club striving to recapture the glory days, and last season so close to doing so. This has become a story of uplifting self-sacrifice in this age when footballers change clubs as often as their socks. Loyalty, however, is oft rewarded by a kick in the head. Gerrard (left), Glen Johnson (centre) and Jordan Henderson on the bench at the Bernabeu . The 34-year-old was also among the subs against Stoke on the 16th anniversary of his Liverpool debut . Gerrard was left out of what might well have been his last huge night in that hallowed red shirt – last month’s Champions League match at Real Madrid. Then he was dropped on his 16th anniversary of becoming a Liverpool player . At 34, this one-club servant finds himself embroiled in turmoil as to whether Liverpool want to contract him to end his career with them – or if even he would prefer now to cash in on his last legs with a move to somewhere like the booming US soccer market. Again, emotions are coming to the boil on Merseyside. The Liverpool skipper celebrates scoring his side's second goal against Leicester on Tuesday . Players past and present are urging him to stay. The fans are petitioning the board to extend his contract. And one of the outstanding players of his generation - the dyed-red Liverpool man who told true-blue Chelsea that he couldn’t quite bring himself to ‘jump off the cliff’ - finds himself back on the precipice. This time with the ground crumbling beneath his feet. Let us hope he makes a happy landing. If the Premier League title is not to be, that is the least Steven Gerrard deserves. Gerrard (third right) poses with fellow Liverpool greats (from left) Ron Yeats, Roger Hunt, Ian Callaghan, Phil Thompson, Phil Neal, Alan Kennedy, Alan Hansen, Kenny Dalglish, Ian Rush, Robbie Fowler, Jamie Carragher and youngsters Raheem Sterling and Jordan Rossiter, with Ian Ayre and Brendan Rodgers at the front . Pele and Ali are The Greatest - long may they last . Muhammad Ali posts a smiling selfie and declares himself fit and well to keep up the good fight against Parkinson’s. Pele reports himself back in the game after a spell in hospital. The Greatest Of All Time and the Greatest Footballer Ever… long may they last. The selfie posted by Muhammad Ali to demonstrate that he is getting better . Back to the Future - it's 1-0 to the Arsenal . To the Arsenal, one-nil. What is going on with the team that couldn’t hold on to a dog lead this season, until now. Is it back to the future? Back to the days when one goal was invariably enough for the Gunners? Perhaps not. The answer now seems to be scoring so late – as Alexis Sanchez did to beat Southampton on Wednesday night – that they only have to defend their lead for a minute or two. Alexis Sanchez (left) smiles after scoring Arsenal's only goal against Southampton .","Steven Gerrard asked Liverpool for a transfer in 2005 .

Peter Pan Live! came  a year after NBC's three-hour live telecast of The Sound of Music starring Carrie Underwood revived the idea of a broadcast network mounting a full-scale musical for live TV. That attracted nearly 19 million viewers but came in for criticism with Carrie Underwood, who played Maria, panned for her 'amateur' acting and Stephen Moyer, as Captain Georg Von Trapp, written off for 'clenched' singing. This time, there was much more dancing, the addition of complicated flying routines, some mermaids, sword fights, digital overlays like Tinkerbell and shadows, and a live dog. Director and choreographer Rob Ashford had his work cut out for him. Like The Sound Of Music, Peter Pan Live! wisely leaned on Broadway performers, including five-time Tony Award-nominee Kelli O'Hara, who was sadly underused, as Mrs Darling. The show also starred Jake Lucas (who was in Broadway show Newsies) as John Darling and a very good Taylor Louderman (Bring It On: The Musical) as Wendy. The beefy-armed Christian Borle, a Tony winner and veteran of last year's The Sound of Music Live!, played Mr Darling. (In a twist, Borle won his Tony playing Captain Hook in the Peter Pan play Peter and the Starcatcher.) Borle, who also stars in NBC’s Smash, actually played two characters - the children’s strict dad Mr Darling as well as Hook’s right-hand pirate, Smee, a character he was far more successful at playing. But one of the stand-out performances came from the show’s second biggest star, Minnie Driver, despite only being seen onscreen for the last five minutes. Despite being the first voice we heard as the narrator throughout, Minnie came out at the very end to play Wendy Darling after she was all grown up - a mother who was still longing for Peter Pan’s return. Captain Hook's pirates were also big hits with viewers during the spirited three-hour special performance .

Wendy's emotional moment at the end as Peter Pan finally returns - and she allows her daughter to follow him to Neverland - was one which moved many fans to tears. It was also a more culturally sensitive Peter Pan, with Alanna Saunders, a 22-year-old woman of Cherokee descent, portraying the Native American princess character Tiger Lily, and the offensive song Ugg-a-Wugg transformed into True Blood Brothers. However the biggest reaction went to a rather unexpected cast member - a crazy bright purple-and-blue crocodile, who tormenting Captain Hook and his pirates throughout. 'And the blue crocodile just broke Twitter,’ viewer Zach Brooks tweeted.

Wendy Darling (pictured right) was played by Taylor Louderman who has also appeared in Broadway musical Bring It On .

Katy Perry: 'I believe in you Allison Williams!' Zach Braff joked: 'Brian Williams is crushing this.' Mia Farrow tweeted: 'Christopher Walken = Gold, no matter what.' Anna Kendrick went on stream of tweets as she watched. She posted: 'Dog is already the only character I care about #PeterPanLive.

"Jessica Wynter gave birth to her baby son Kye in a onesie after he was born suddenly as she struggled across a hospital car park . A young mother who gave birth in a onesie as she struggled across a hospital car park has described the moment she found her baby son ‘curled up in the right leg, safe and sound’. Jessica Wynter was taken to hospital by her parents after she went into labour one-week early. But she ran out of time when she got to the car park of King's College Hospital, in Lambeth, south London, and little Kye was born in the onesie. Ms Wynter, 21, described how at the time she thought her waters had broken, saying it 'felt like a rubber duck slapped across my leg'. She said it was lucky she had been wearing the garment as it prevented baby Kye from hitting the floor. She said: 'I got up because I wasn't in pain any more. My mum came over and we could both hear crying coming from inside. 'I unzipped the onesie and Kye was curled up in the right leg, safe and sound. 'He looked really happy just sitting there.' Ms Wynter said she woke up at three in the morning on December 27 suffering from serious back pain. The Coventry University design student, from Streatham, was in pain throughout the day and decided to get into a hot bath at 5.30pm in a bid to soothe her backache. She then realised however that she was going into labour. She put on the polka dot adult-sized babygro as her mother Christine and father Davonne helped her into the car to race to hospital. She was undergoing contractions in the car and ran out of time straight after arriving at the hospital car park. Following the birth, the pair were stretchered into the maternity ward where medics checked little Kye to make sure he was healthy . Kye was suddenly born as his mother struggled across the car park to the hospital. He was caught safely in the leg of his mother's polka dot onesie, given to her at Christmas by her grandmother Enid. Ms Wynter said: 'My contractions were nearly five minutes apart and my back was in agony - I realised I was in labour. 'It . was really scary. I went in the bath a couple of times for the pain. By . the time dad got home I knew that we had to go to the hospital. Ms Wynter gave birth as she made her way across the car park at King's College Hospital, in Lambeth, south London . 'We left around half five in the afternoon. I was yelling ""He's here he's here"". 'I was in the back seat of the car screaming my heart out. Ms Wynter said it was 'so lucky' she put the onesie on before going to the hospital . 'I was really frightened and in pain and I kept worrying we would be stopped because I had no seatbelt.' Her . father parked up in the drop off area but after she got out of the car . Ms Wynter struggled as she tried to make her way to the hospital . She . said: 'And I knew something had come out. I thought it was the water . sack. It felt like a rubber duck slapped across my leg.' Ms Wynter said eight doctors turned up following the birth, with one throwing a blanket over the new mother to keep her warm. She was then stretchered into the maternity ward where medics checked little Kye to make sure he was healthy. Ms Wynter said: 'His temperature was a little bit low because he was born outside but apart from that he seemed fine. 'He was born at 39 weeks, a week early. 'I just threw on the onesie as I came out of the bath. It could have been anything else, it's so lucky. 'If it had been something like a nightie I don't think he would have survived. 'I was in so much shock when I saw him on my leg. I couldn't believe it. Lots of babies don't stick to a time schedule so every day surprise deliveries can regularly be a cause of havoc for parents as well as medical staff. Last summer, MailOnline reported how on Tuesday, June 18, a father delivered his daughter's baby in the front seat of his car, while three days later a baby said hello to the world in a police station. Two weeks previously an eager tot arrived a month early while his blindsided mother was on the toilet. Father-of-three, Tony Hall, described how he delivered his daughter's baby in the front seat of his car on a busy road after he had been driving her to hospital when he was caught up in heavy school traffic in Welling in Bexley, London. And Kayleigh Thompson and Dan Hunt, who worked together to deliver their baby boy in their bathroom on May 31, have a lasting reminder of the big day after they named him Lou. 'I've got to keep the onesie in my keepsake box- it's just so surreal. 'I'm sure I'll tell him all about it when he's older, probably as soon as he can talk.' Doctors said Kye, who was born at 6lb 5oz, was healthy and well enough for the pair to be allowed to return home the same day. The onesie has been washed and will be kept in a keepsake box as a reminder of Kaye's dramatic arrival. Ms Wynter's father Davonne, 48, said: 'It's a real shock to the system. 'When I was coming home from work I had no idea what was about to happen. 'I parked in the drop off area in the hospital and went to call the labour unit to let them know Jessica had arrived. 'I got back and she was on all fours in pain screaming. The next thing I knew, about eight medical staff appeared and it was all over. 'She thought she had given birth to the water sac, not the actual baby. 'We were all in a state of complete shock. If it had been a night dress who knows what could have happened, it's such a blessing really. 'I'm just thankful that she had the onesie on - it's so lucky he's safe. 'I'm sure lot's of young mums are going to want them now.'","Jessica Wynter, 21, was rushed to hospital after going into labour early .

"Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea is set to hand manager Louis van Gaal an almighty boost by declaring himself fit for Saturday evening’s visit to Arsenal. De Gea dislocated his little finger during a Spain training session last week but the injury is understood to have improved to such an extent that he now believes he has a high chance of starting at the Emirates Stadium. Sources close to the Spanish team told Sportsmail on Tuesday evening that the United No 1 has ‘an 80 per cent’ chance of making the starting line-up when his club return to Barclays Premier League action this weekend. Manchester United could be handed a boost with the news David de Gea might play against Arsenal . The Spain stopper injured a finger while away with the national team last week .

It is telling that De Gea has been allowed to remain with Spain despite suffering the injury. He was also named on the bench for the 3-0 victory over Belarus on Saturday and the clash against Germany in Vigo on Tuesday night.

"When the final FIFA FIFPro World XI is announced at the Ballon d'Or award ceremony at the Kongresshaus in Zurich on January 12, it could end up reading a lot like one of Carlo Ancelotti's team-sheets. Real Madrid have one goalkeeper, five defenders, three midfielders and three strikers in the 55-player shortlist. Coach Ancelotti could also pick up the manger's gong and Cristiano Ronaldo, with a record breaking 17 goals in last season's Champions League campaign, is favourite to win the main prize – the Ballon d'Or. Real Madrid forward Cristiano Ronaldo is favourite to retain his Ballon d'Or crown in Zurich next month . Carlo Ancelotti could claim FIFA's coach of the year award after leading Real to Champions League glory . Manuel Neuer, Dani Carvajal, Diego Godin, Sergio Ramos, Philipp Lahm; James Rodriguez, Toni Kroos, Angel di Maria; Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi . *Real Madrid players in bold . The current European champions are on a run of 17 straight wins that should extend to 20 with home games against Celta Vigo, Ludogorets and Almeria to come before they travel to Morocco where they will play the Club World Cup. By the time the awards ceremony comes around they could be sat on top of the world, as well as favourites to become the first side ever to retain the Champions League. The manner in which they have won their last five Champions League games has seen to that. Their La Liga form – brushing aside Barcelona when the two teams in met in October - has them on top and expected to take that crown, too. When FIFA finally announce their team of teams Madrid will have to cede some territory to other clubs. After a poor World Cup, Iker Casillas maybe be back to his best in La Liga but it will surely be too late to prevent Manuel Neuer from being voted best goalkeeper. Atletico Madrid's Diego Godin should be picked in the defence and that will mean that Sergio Ramos and Pepe – both worthy of spots in the XI – will have to contest the other centre-back position. As one of the Ballon d'Or finalists Lionel Messi will make the team so Real Madrid's BBC forward line of Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema and Ronaldo will not be able to make a clean sweep of the front three. Welshman Gareth Bale has been nominated for FIFA's World XI after a fine first season in Madrid . Summer signing James Rodriguez, pictured scoring against Cornella, is one FIFA's nominated midfielders . Ballon d'Or: Cristiano Ronaldo . Best goalkeeper: Iker Casillas . Best defenders: Dani Carvajal, Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Marcelo, Raphael Varane . Best midfielders: Toni Kroos, James Rodriguez, Luka Modric . Best forwards: Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale, Karim Benzema . The midfield could well be made up of current Real stars and players who were integral to Madrid's success last season - Luka Modric, James Rodriguez and Toni Kroos are in competition with Angel di Maria and Xabi Alonso. Whatever shape the final team takes it could comfortably have five Madrid players in it, plus those sold in the summer. And the powers that be at the Bernabeu won't even mind if players let go in August make the cut. Such has been the success of new faces Kroos and Rodriguez that the sales of Alonso and Di Maria, that stung so much at the start of the season, now no longer trouble supporters. Rodriguez already has nine goals – just two short of Di Maria's total of 11 for the last campaign. It now looks a masterstroke especially as the Colombia star is on £1.5million-a-year less than the Argentine would have cost under the terms of the new deal he felt – with some justification after his brilliant season – that he deserved. Scooping the individual prizes in Zurich in January will be no guarantee that come the end of the season Real will have another cupboard full of trophies but there does seem to be a drive about the squad that is missing both from Barcelona and some of the teams they are likely to come up against in the Champions League knockout stages. A clean sweep in the FIFA FIFPro team is unlikely but they look on course to go on dominating football for some time.

"Thousands of Holocaust victims transported to Nazi concentration camps by a French railway company will be entitled to compensation. France and the US have agreed a £40 million ($60 million) settlement fund, that will be financed by the French Government. Survivors who were deported by France's state rail company SNCF during World War II will be able to make a claim. Scroll down for video . Hundreds of holocaust victims transported to Nazi concentration camps by the French state railway company will be entitled to compensation, it has been announced. French President Francois Hollande pictured at a train car that represents the Drancy concentration camp, in Drancy, a Paris suburb, France (file picture) As part of the deal, the US Government will work to end lawsuits and and compensation claims against SNCF. The rail company is currently bidding for a lucrative high-speed rail contract in the US and some State Legislators had been trying to punish it SNCF for its Holocaust actions. 'This is another measure of justice for the harms of one of history's darkest eras,' said the U.S. Special Adviser on Holocaust Issues, Stuart Eizenstat, who spent three years working with French officials on the agreement. SNCF transported about 76,000 French Jews to Nazi concentration camps, though experts disagree on its degree of guilt. It is believed only an estimated 3,000 French Jews survived the horrendous concentration camps. SNCF has expressed regret for what happened, but argues it had no effective control over operations during the Nazi occupation from 1940 to 1944. The French Foreign Ministry and U.S. State Department announced an accord Friday on the compensation fund, which will be financed by the French government and managed by the United States. The agreement will be signed Monday in Washington, but it still must get approval from the French Parliament, which could take months. The French government has already paid more than $6 billion in reparations — but only to French citizens and certain deportees. Victims could be entitled to up to £62,000 as part of the agreement between France and the US. Pictured French Holocaust survivors gathering at the site of the former Drancy detention camp, north of Paris, France (file picture) The French Government are paying for the compensation fund. French President Francois Hollande standing at attention in front of a train car that represents the Drancy camp (file picture) The new deal will allow compensation for Americans, Israelis and some others who were not eligible for other French reparations programs. There are around 250 people in the U.S. who are eligible under the new fund as direct survivors or spouses, according to an advocacy group, but several thousand may be eligible as heirs to survivors or spouses. The money should break down to about $100,000 each for survivors, and tens of thousands of dollars for spouses, Eizenstat said. Although SNCF is not a party to the agreement, the company will contribute $4 million over the next five years to fund Holocaust memorials and museums in the U.S., Israel and France, according to Eizenstat. The French government has pledged to encourage French lawmakers to approve the deal, Eizenstat said. 'The objective today was to be able to provide reparations — even 70 years later — that they could claim, given the trauma, the barbarity and the horror that the deportation represented for them,' said Patrizianna Sparacino-Thiellay, a French ambassador for human rights who was a key architect of the deal. The French government is holding several events marking 70 years since the Allies liberated France from Nazi control in 1944. U.S. Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney of New York, who had pushed the U.S. government to pressure France to agree to compensation, hailed the deal as a 'breakthrough in a decades-long struggle for justice.' The Anti-Defamation League, a Jewish civil rights organization, also welcomed the accord. 'There is no amount of money that could ever make up for the horrific injustice done to these victims and their families,' said Abraham Foxman, ADL's national director and a Holocaust survivor. 'But agreements like this provide some modest redress, an important recognition of their pain, and acknowledge the responsibility of governments and institutions to leave no stone unturned in seeking every possible measure of justice for Holocaust victims.' The deal comes as France, home to western Europe's largest Jewish community, is battling new concerns about anti-Semitism. French authorities and Jewish leaders denounced a rape and robbery attack with anti-Semitic overtones this week against a French couple. The number of anti-Semitic incidents in France has grown 91 percent this year compared to last year, according to CRIF, France's leading Jewish organization. Jewish groups in France are also concerned about rising Islamic extremism and the resurgent far right.","France and US announce £40 million fund for Holocaust survivors .

"Those headed out to Denver are willing to shell out for more than just eggs on Easter weekend which also falls on April 20, the nation's unofficial holiday for the celebration of marijuana. Ever since Colorado made recreational marijuana use legal, the state has felt a boom in tourist revenue and this weekend, the numbers are expected to smoke out old records. CBS reports that Denver hotel searches on Hotels.com have increased by 73 per cent nationwide when compared to the same time frame in 2013. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joe Rey, a grower at 3D Cannabis Center, waters marijuana plants at the company facility in Denver where recreational marijuana use is legal . Hotels.com shows a graph exhibiting the increase in searches for Denver hotels ever since the legalization of marijuana in Colorado .

Ever since marijuana has made Denver an even more popular tourist spot more and more people are expected to visit the city from all over the globe. 'People are coming nationally from all over the U.S. but I’m also seeing a lot of international guests as well,' said Christine Lunsford, operations director at the Denver weed shop 3D Cannabis Center. 'They’re all coming here because cannabis is legal in Colorado and they’re all excited to be here,' CBS spoke with a few of Denver's Easter weekend visitors to see what made them decide to visit Colorado for the special holiday.

Yelvington was unable to check in early at her hotel because it was so busy. The marijuana enthusiast decided to kill some time at a pot shop which she describes as a surreal experience. 'I would say that the 4/20 weekend is a destination weekend here in Denver because we have people coming from all over and for tourism there’s been a huge spike,' Lunsford said.

"Said research house prices will be 13 per cent higher over next 20 years than if migration were at zero . House prices will rise by more than 10 per cent unless mass immigration is controlled, Theresa May warned yesterday. The increases in the years to come would go beyond other pressures on the housing market – dealing a blow to young Britons already struggling to get on the property ladder. In a speech in London, the Home Secretary delivered a blunt analysis of the impact of Labour’s ‘open door’ immigration policy. Home Secretary Theresa May announced plans for a simplified visa applications for overseas students . She said the influx had driven down wages for the working classes and placed huge pressure on schools and social cohesion. Mrs May cited house prices as an . example of how demand created by migrants was having an impact on the . wider public. Her officials pointed to research by Professor Stephen . Nickell which predicted that, if net immigration runs at 190,000 a year, . house prices will end up 13 per cent higher over the next two decades . than they would if migration were at zero. Currently, net migration – the . difference between the number of people arriving in the UK and those . leaving – is 183,000, though Mrs May has vowed to reduce it to the ‘tens . of thousands’. Busy: The need for housing is growing . She said: ‘More than one third of all new housing demand . in Britain is caused by immigration. ‘And there is evidence that without . the demand caused by mass immigration, house prices could be 10 per cent . lower over a 20 year period.’ Mrs May delivered her speech to the . Policy Exchange think-tank only 24 hours after publication of the 2011 . census. The survey showed how, under ten years of Labour, nearly four . million immigrants joined the population of England and Wales. In total, 7.5million people who were . born abroad were living here last year – and more than half of these . have arrived since 2001. In a blistering attack on the Labour . years, Mrs May criticised the last government for failing to measure the . impact of immigration on public services and housing, and for assuming . it had no impact on the jobs and wages of the settled population. She warned that mass immigration . undermines social cohesion by making it ‘impossible’ to establish the . relationships, family ties and social bonds that create a community. Mrs May said the Migration Advisory . Committee, which is a panel of government advisers, had found ‘a clear . association between non-European immigration and employment in the UK’ – . with 160,000 British workers ‘displaced’ between 1995 and 2010. Some 23 British workers were  kept out . of employment for every additional 100 immigrants employed, she said, . adding: ‘For those on lower wages, more immigration means more workers . competing for a limited number of low-skilled jobs. ‘The result is lower wages – and the . people who lose out are working-class families, as well as ethnic . minority communities and recent immigrants themselves.’ In future, government impact . assessments will no longer assume that migrants make a positive . contribution to the economy by paying taxes and spending their wages. The burden they place on public services will also be considered, she said. Mrs May also denounced the student visa policy inherited from Labour as a ‘mess’ which was ‘abused on an industrial scale’. Last night Sir Andrew Green, chairman . of Migration Watch, said: ‘At last we have a Home Secretary who is . honest about the consequences of mass immigration and ready to take on . the bogus arguments for it.’","Home Secretary: ‘More than one third of all new housing demand caused by immigration'

"In October 2004 skeletal remains found on the island of Flores in Indonesia hinted at a previously unknown species of human that existed 15,000 years ago. Called Homo floresiensis, the species was dubbed a ‘hobbit’ as it was smaller than any other known species of human. But reanalysis has revealed that it may not be a new species at all, but rather a human that has features consistent with someone with Down's syndrome. Reanalysis of bones found in Indonesia suggests they are not from a 'hobbit'. Scientists say the finding on Flores Island can be attributed to Down's syndrome. This image compares the skull of the 'hobbit' LB1 (left) to that of Liang Momer E, another skull from Flores, dated in the range of 3,000 to 5,000 years ago . The latest findings, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted by an international team of researchers. They suggest that the single specimen on which the new designation depends, known as LB1 after the cave it was discovered in - Liang Bua - does not represent a new species. Indeed, aside from LB1, no substantial new bone discoveries have been made in the cave since this finding. ‘The skeletal sample from Liang Bua cave contains fragmentary remains of several individuals,’ said Dr Robert Eckhardt, professor of developmental genetics and evolution at Penn State University. ‘LB1 has the only skull and thigh bones in the entire sample.’ The first indicator that the finding could be explained by Down's syndrome was craniofacial asymmetry, a left-right mismatch of the skull that is characteristic of the disorder. The 15,000-year-old skeleton, officially known as Homo floresiensis, got its nickname from its squat stature. The 3-foot (1-metre) tall, 30-year-old female was based on remains that were uncovered in the Liang Bua cave on the remote Indonesian island of Flores in 2003. Since the discovery, scientists debated whether the specimen actually represents an extinct species in the human family tree, perhaps a diminutive offshoot of Homo erectus, a 1.8-million-year-old hominid and the first to have body proportions comparable to those of modern Homo sapiens. The researchers noted this asymmetry in LB1 as early as 2006, but it had not been reported by the excavating team and was later dismissed as a result of the skull's being long buried, he said. Initial descriptions of Homo floresiensis focused on LB1's unusual anatomical characteristics: a cranial volume reported as only 380 milliliters (23.2 cubic inches), suggesting a brain less than one third the size of an average modern human. The skeleton also had short thigh bones, which were used to reconstruct a creature standing only 3.5 feet (1.06 metres) tall. Although LB1 lived only 15,000 years ago, comparisons were made to earlier hominins, including Homo erectus and Australopithecus. Other traits were characterised as unique and therefore indicative of a new species. But a thorough re-examination of the available evidence in the context of clinical studies, the researchers said, suggests a different explanation. In the first place, they write, the original figures for cranial volume and stature are underestimates, ‘markedly lower than any later attempts to confirm them.’ The researchers have consistently found a cranial volume of about 430 milliliters (26.2 cubic inches). 'The difference is significant, and the revised figure falls in the range predicted for a modern human with Down's syndrome from the same geographic region,' Dr Eckhardt said. The latest findings, reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was conducted by an international team of researchers. They suggest that the single specimen on which the new designation depends, known as LB1 after the cave it was discovered in - Liang Buaon Flores Island - is not a new species . LB1 is shown in three different views to illustrate facial asymmetry. A is the actual specimen, B is the right side doubled at the midline and mirrored, and C is the left side doubled and mirrored. Differences in left and right side facial architectures are apparent, and illustrate growth abnormalities of LB1 . The original estimate of 3.5 feet (1.06 metres) for the creature's height was based on extrapolation combining the short thigh bone with a formula derived from an African pygmy population. But humans with Down's syndrome also have diagnostically short thigh bones, Dr Eckhardt said. Though these and other features are unusual, he acknowledged, 'unusual does not equal unique. 'The originally reported traits are not so rare as to have required the invention of a new hominin species.' Instead, the researchers build the case for an alternative diagnosis: that of Down's syndrome, one of the most commonly occurring developmental disorders in modern humans. 'When we first saw these bones, several of us immediately spotted a developmental disturbance,' said Eckhardt, 'but we did not assign a specific diagnosis because the bones were so fragmentary. 'Over the years, several lines of evidence have converged on Down's syndrome.' This reconstruction of what LB1 was once thought to look like was created by researchers in Australia at the University of Woollongong in 2012. Using the skill fragments found in Flores, they added muscle and skin to reveal her face, but the assumption she was a new species of human may now not be true . Here Dr Susan Hayes (right) looks at a replica of Homo floresienses with Penny Williamson from the University of Woollongong's Earth and Environmental Sciences back in 2012. The new research, however, claims the bones have all the markings of an ancient human that suffered from Down's syndrome . A previously unpublished measurement of LB1's occipital-frontal circumference - the circumference of the skull taken roughly above the tops of the ears - allowed the researchers to compare LB1 to clinical data routinely collected on patients with developmental disorders. Here too, the brain size they estimate is within the range expected for an Australomelanesian human with Down's syndrome. LB1's short thigh bones not only match the height reduction seen in Down's syndrome, Dr Eckhardt said, but when corrected statistically for normal growth, they would yield a stature of about 1.26 meters, or just over four feet, a figure matched by some humans now living on Flores and in surrounding regions. These and other Down-like characteristics, the researchers state, are present only in LB1, and not in the other Liang Bua skeletal remains, further evidence of LB1's abnormality. 'This work is not presented in the form of a fanciful story, but to test a hypothesis: Are the skeletons from Liang Bua cave sufficiently unusual to require invention of a new human species?' Dr Eckhardt said. 'Our reanalysis shows that they are not. The less strained explanation is a developmental disorder. 'Here the signs point rather clearly to Down's syndrome, which occurs in more than one per thousand human births around the world.'","Reanalysis of bones found  in Indonesia suggests they are not from a 'hobbit'

"Ukip has been revealed as the laziest party in the whole of Europe, missing more than one in three votes in Brussels. Nigel Farage’s MEPs turned up for just 61.1 per cent of votes, putting them at the bottom of a league table of 76 parties from across the EU. David Cameron has urged voters to back the Tories in next week’s European elections, because his MEPs will ‘turn up and vote for Britain’. An analysis of voting records in the European Parliament reveals Ukip MEPs turn up for fewer votes than any other party . An analysis of voting records of the last five years in the European Parliament reveals Ukip members are the worst attendees. The study by VoteWatch Europe for The Times looked at all parties with more than three MEPs from across the 26 nations in the EU bloc. Ukip was ranked 76th out of 76 parties, attending on average 61.1 per cent of votes over the five-year Parliament. Among the six worst MEPs out of 764, three were from Ukip. It includes controversial figure Godfrey Bloom, who resigned as a Ukip MEP after calling a room of women at a party event ‘sluts’ last year. Mr Bloom attended just 23.11 per cent of votes, the lowest of any politician in the EU, although in 2012 he was treated for cancer and spent time away from Brussels and Strasbourg. By contrast, the 12 Lib Dems in Brussels turned up for 86.9 per cent of votes, putting them at 29th in the league table, Labour ranked 41st on 85 per cent and the Conservatives 60th on 80.4 per cent. Mr Cameron yesterday insisted it was vital that British MEPs take part in votes in the European Parliament to influence new laws. ‘These elections do matter,’ the Prime Minister told LBC 97.3. ‘The European Parliament makes rules that apply to our businesses, it spends money that comes out of our taxpayers’ pockets. ‘We should send people there who are going to turn up and vote for Britain. ‘One of the things about my budget cut in Europe, that saved Britain £8bn, is actually the Ukip MEPs, including Nigel Farage, voted against it in the European Parliament. ‘So, you know, it’s like that expression, a dog is for life not just for Christmas, you’re sending men and women to the European Parliament, send those that have got a plan for sorting our Britain’s relationship and defending our interest.’ David Cameron has insisted voting in the European Parliament elections does matter . Ukip leader Mr Farage was ranked 759th after taking part in 43 per cent of votes. He has previously defended his party’s voting record, , insisting Ukip's policy of engaging ‘sufficiently’ with the EU to provoke debate had proved successful. ‘Our objective as MEPs is not to keep voting endlessly for more EU legislation and to take power away from Westminster,’ he said in March. ‘Our view in 15 years has been that we engage sufficiently here and we use that information to get a debate going back in the United Kingdom. ‘It seems to me, given the debate we are now having on the European Union, that the Ukip policy has been pretty successful.’ However Doru Frantescu, policy director of Vote-Watch, told The Times: ‘The fact that a political group or a national party delegation is less participative than others when voting clearly diminishes its power to influence the outcome of EU legislation.’ ""Many people don’t realise that a vote for UKIP is a vote for the laziest party in the European Parliament"" Richard Howitt, a Labour MEP, said: ‘Ukip has vacated its duties in the European Parliament just as it would leave Britain with an empty seat at the EU table. 'Voters need to understand quite how lazy Ukip MEPs are. They are not only among the fringe parties in Europe but are also the laziest.’ Liberal Democrat MEP Fiona Hall: 'There is no doubt about it, UKIP MEPs offer the worst possible value for money for their constituents. Time and again they fail to turn up for crucial votes that benefit British citizens, whether it's research funding for our leading universities, slashing roaming charges for holidaymakers or ending wasteful overfishing in our seas. 'As the hardest-working delegation in Brussels, Lib Dem MEPs strive day in and day out to stand up for British interests and build a stronger, fairer and greener economy.' The Green Party has two MEPs, so was not included in the study. However, the party said its MEPs turned up to more than 90 per cent of votes. Green MEP Keith Taylor said: 'This new research makes it clear that UKIP simply can’t be trusted to represent their constituents. Their MEPs happily claim the parliamentary salary and expenses, but they don’t even show up to four in ten of the key votes. 'Many people don’t realise that a vote for UKIP is a vote for the laziest party in the European Parliament.'","Ukip ranked bottom in league table of 76 parties from across the EU .

"Zinedine Zidane's eldest son, Enzo, made his debut for Real Madrid's B side during their 2-1 victory at home to Conquense on Sunday - with his father helping lead the team from the touchline. Real Castilla assistant boss Zidane sent his progeny on with just two minutes left of the match on Sunday. The 19-year-old midfielder failed to score in his extremely short cameo appearance but is expected to become more involved with first-team affairs at the Segunda B - or Spanish third division - side in the coming weeks.

Zinedine Zidane (left), playing for Real Madrid back in 2006, and his son Enzo, for their youth side in March . Despite only being on the pitch for a matter of minutes, Enzo managed to pull off an impressive 'roulette' trick. Unsurprisingly, Enzo has been courted by both France and Spain as they look to secure him for their national set-ups. Having already played for the Spanish Under 15 side, the young midfielder was called to France to undertake medical tests with their Under 19 team and has since decided to represent the country of his birth. He was named after Enzo Francescoli, who made 73 appearances for Uruguay and scored 17 goals, as well as playing for French side Marseille. The youngster, who has elected to play for the France Under-19 side, came on in the 88th minute . Enzo Zidane (centre) had represented Spain at Under-15 level but has now switched allegiance to France . Zidane's two younger sons, Theo and Eliza, are also being groomed by Real Madrid's academy and their father hopes they will make it into the squad in the future too. Enzo is renowned for his trickery and below is a Vine showing him performing outrageous skills during the Real youth side's match with Sevilla in June.

"South Korea has displayed for the first time all three DIY drones that have landed on its soil in recent weeks, adding that tests suggest they are highly likely to have been built and sent by North Korea. Wreckage from each of the crude and decidedly low-tech drones was displayed during a press conference by South Korea's Agency for Defense Development in the city of Daejeon this morning. Last week South Korean experts said that although the drones were fitted with simple Nikon and Canon cameras that are available to purchase on the internet for just a few hundred dollars, they underscore a new threat from North Korea that must be taken seriously. Crude: Wreckage of the decidedly low-tech drones was displayed during a press conference by South Korea's state-run Agency for Defense Development in Daejeon this morning . Evidence: The South Korean Defence Ministry said the distinctive sky blue colour of the drones was similar to those displayed to the North's communist leader Kim Jong-un during a recent military parade . Basic: The drones were fitted with simple Nikon and Canon cameras that can be purchased cheaply online . During today's press conference, South Korea's defense ministry spokesman Kim Min-seok was quoted as saying: 'A joint investigation result found several pieces of circumstantial evidence that strongly show the small UAVs were sent by North Korea'. He said the technical specifications of the drones and the photos found on their cameras suggest they had not travelled to the country from China or Japan, according to the Yonhap News Agency. The spokesman reportedly also said the distinctive sky blue colour of the drones was similar to those displayed to the North's communist leader Kim Jong-un during a recent military parade. Kim Min-seok is said to have added that the drones would be show to several other countries - including the United States - before South Korea could formally conclude they were sent from the North. Threat: If, as expected, the drones turn out to have come from North Korea, the South has already warned it will consider a military response, branding the drones a serious provocation . Distance: South Korea's defense ministry reportedly said the technical specifications of the drones and the photos found on their cameras suggest they had not travelled to the country from China or Japan .

If, as expected, that turns out to be . the case, South Korea has already warned it will consider a military response, . branding the drones a serious provocation. Earlier this week South Korea released pictures of one of the small rudimentary drones shortly after it landed on its soil. The wreckage - which looks more like a remote-controlled toy aeroplane than a piece of military hardware - was reported on April 3 after it was found by a 53-year-old wild ginseng digger. The drones have sparked fears that Kim Jong-Un's dictatorship could adapt the technology for terror attacks. Simplistic: A parachute and a large bundle of orange wires were found alongside this simple drone, which crashed in South Korea in recent weeks . Earlier this week South Korea released pictures of one of the small rudimentary drones found on a mountain in Samcheok, South Korea . North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (second from the right) looks at small drones in an image captured from a documentary that aired on Korean Central Television on June 16, 2013 . The most recent unmanned aircraft was found in mountains near Samcheok, in South Korea's Gangwon Province. One had crashed in Paju, a city near the border with North Korea, on March 24. The other crashed on the island of Baengnyeong. The captured drones were basic, at best, South Korean experts told Hani.co.kr, but they if improved they could be used for terrorist attacks. The most recent to crash was equipped with  Japanese-made Canon cameras available on the internet for just a few hundred pounds. The Paju drone was also equipped with a Canon camera and the other one carried a Nikon camera. All three were painted sky blue and probably cost only a few thousand dollars to build. The two earlier drones were smaller, 55in wide by 71in long. The drone was 4ft long with a 6ft wingspan and weighed 15kg . The drone was equipped with Japanese-made cameras available on the internet for just a few hundred pounds . Officials said lettering on the . battery of the drone found at Paju and other forensic evidence suggest . it was of North Korean origin and it had enough fuel to return to North . Korea. In June last year, North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un was filmed looking at small . drones in an image captured from a documentary that aired on Korean . Central Television. According to the military, the third . drone was 4ft long with a 6ft wingspan and weighed 15kg. The site was . approximately 130km from the Military Demarcation Line, making this the . farthest south of the armistice line of any suspected North Korean . drones found to date. Ministry . of National Defense spokesman Kim Min-seok said the military was sent to the site where the . small drone was found after a report was received from a local resident. 'The location was 940 meters above sea level in the area of Cheongok Mountain in Samcheok's Hajang Township,' Kim said. 'The UAV was confirmed to be the same type as the triangular, sky-blue miniature UAV found in Paju,' he added. The camera's memory chip contained photographs, but these were no longer available after the man, called Lee, erased the device for personal use, the military reported. This reconnaissance picture shows an aerial view of Seoul's Jichuk Station: The discovery has prompted fears that South Korea's air defences are not up to the job of in the new era of drone warfare . Spying: This undated handout picture provided by the South Korean Defence Ministry shows an aerial image of Eunpyung New Town, Seoul, from a camera on the unmanned North Korean drone which crashed in Paju . Rudimentary: A suspected North Korean reconnaissance drone found near Paju . A military official quoted Lee as recalling that images of Donggwang Lake (near Samcheok) and coastal regions were present before the data was erased. However hundreds of images were found on the drone found at Paju, including the South Korean president's compound in Seoul. Security has been stepped up at the Blue . House in Seoul, the official residence of current President Park . Guen-hye and location of a 1968 assassination attempt by Pyongyang . against the then South Korean leader, since the discovery. The discovery has sparked fears that Kim Jong-Un's dictatorship could adapt the technology for terror attacks . The Ministry of National Defense said it plans to hold a meeting of major general commanders today to assess the security situation and present detailed guidelines for a firm response. The Joint Chiefs of Staff also plans to hold simultaneous reconnaissance patrols for all its units this week in case additional North Korean drones were deployed. 'If North Korea is determined to be responsible, we plan to respond sternly and in various ways, including possible legal action for the violation of our airspace,' said Kwon Oh-han, an Army major general and director of the JCS operational bureau. Meanwhile, North Korea made its first public mention of the drone controversy on April 5, twelve days after the discovery of the Paju drone was reported in the press on Mar. 25. But the statement neither confirmed nor denied South Korean authorities' claims of North Korea's responsibility for the drones. While criticising a recent missile test launch by South Korea, the statement from a North Korean strategic forces spokesman said Seoul had 'further damaged its already rock-bottom dignity with an out-of-nowhere drone situation.' It went on to say that 'unidentified drones were flying freely around downtown Seoul, including the Blue House and Gyeongbok Palace areas, and blithely traveling the skies over where Baengnyeong Island was being pummeled.'","Three small and basic drones were found in South Korea in recent weeks .

"CLICK HERE to read who Sportsmail Columnists Jamie Redknapp and Martin Keown think will win the two-horse title race between City and Chelsea . For once, the sound of team-mates lavishing praise on a colleague was not laden with toe- curling cliches. It is the norm for players, when pressed on the merits of a comrade, to trot out well-worn words which, ultimately, hold no substance whatsoever. But as Pablo Zabaleta and Stevan Jovetic stood outside the dressing-rooms at the Stadium of Light, there was relief and appreciation that the subject of their post-match reflection was in their team. Sergio Aguero had been awesome and Zabaleta made it plain how much the striker is valued. Sergio Aguero's opening strike at Sunderland was among the best of his  goals so far this season . The reigning champions have closed the gap on Chelsea at the top of the table to six points . The Argentinian forward is almost single-handedly responsible for City's recent resurgence . ‘Everything he does right now looks so quick, sharp and clinical,’ said the defender. ‘He is working really hard for the team off the ball and that is also something you have to appreciate from Sergio, because the strikers normally want to play only with the ball. ‘He is probably the best striker in the world at the moment. We are very lucky to have Sergio in the team.’ A hundred yards along the corridor, Manchester City manager Manuel Pellegrini was echoing their salute, likewise Sunderland boss Gus Poyet. Aguero won warm applause on a cold night from the home fans when, after two goals and an assist during Wednesday’s 4-1 victory, he was substituted late on. Four days earlier, those same supporters had jeered Chelsea’s Diego Costa after he was shackled by Sunderland’s backline during a goalless draw. Aguero's brace this season has taken his league tally to 14 goals - top of the Premier League scoring charts . Argentina team-mate Pablo Zabaleta's only regret is that Aguero was not fit and fully firing at the World Cup . But they, like their striker Jozy Altidore who mouthed ‘Oh my God!’ following Aguero’s stunning equaliser, were in awe of the City marksman. Zabaleta is already a two-time Premier League champion, in large part thanks to Aguero. But he could have been a World Cup winner had his Argentine compatriot not been troubled by a loss of form and fitness in Brazil. ‘Of course you think what might have been in the World Cup if he’d been fit,’ said Zabaleta, who was part of the team beaten in the final by Germany. ‘But I have known him for a long time and this is probably the best moment of his whole career.’ It is little wonder Jovetic was queuing up to join the appreciation society, for he had profited from Aguero’s brilliance to net his fourth goal of the season. Stevan Jovetic points to Aguero after the free-scoring Argentine set up his goal against Sunderland . Jovetic believes Aguero is behind only Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo (right) as the world's best players . Given their proximity on the pitch, the Montenegrin is well placed to offer assessment of his 26-year-old strike partner. ‘He is the best player I have played with — he and David Silva,’ said Jovetic, referencing the Spanish playmaker who could return from a knee injury against Everton tomorrow. ‘But Sergio can score some goals! He is great. He does it every game, and for me it is Messi and Ronaldo and then him — one of the best players in the world. ‘I liked the first goal because when he stopped the ball it was going away from him, and in the last second he did a nutmeg, and scored. ‘Then his assist for me was great as well. He is on fire, and if he is like this we can do big things.’ Manuel Pellegrini will be hoping his side can take advantage of a friendly set of festive fixtures . This, though, is not simply the Sergio Aguero show. Zabaleta, Fernandinho and Jesus Navas were all outstanding in midweek. And that is why — especially given the kindness of their fixtures amid the festive frenzy — it is they who could be top of the tree when the time arrives to take down the decorations; Leicester, Crystal Palace, West Bromwich and Burnley — four of the bottom six — could well represent the 12 points of Christmas for Pellegrini’s men. With Silva and Edin Dzeko set to return and the positive prognosis on Vincent Kompany’s hamstring meaning he could be back at Leicester next weekend, it is looking like a winter of content for a team who have now won four on the spin. Aguero is on the scoresheet and his pals are giving praise from the same songsheet. Suddenly, everything is in tune at the Etihad.","Sergio Aguero leads the Premier League scoring charts with 14 goals .

"Shame: Mostafa Ahmed Awwad, 35, of Yorktown, covers his face as he leaves the federal courthouse in Norfolk . A U.S. Navy civilian engineer has been indicted on charges after he tried to steal schematics of an aircraft carrier under construction and have them sent to Egypt. Mostafa Ahmed Awwad, 35, of Yorktown, Virginia, was arrested on two counts of attempted exportation of defense articles and technical data on Friday. He provided computer drawings downloaded from the Navy to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Egyptian intelligence officer. Prosecutors said Awwad intended to steal technical data about the designs of the USS Gerald R. Ford in late October. He was contacted by an undercover FBI agent speaking in Arabic in September and the pair met the next day at a park in Hampton. At the meeting, Awwad said he intended to use his position of trust with the Navy to obtain military technology for use by the Egyptian government. He met the agent for a second time in October at a hotel where Awwad described his plan to circumvent Navy computer security by installing software enabling him to copy documents without tripping a security alert. Later, the undercover agent was given aircraft carrier drawings marked with warnings that foreign distribution could result in criminal prosecution. The designs were for the 'Ford' the lead ship in a new class of carriers which is scheduled for delivery to the Navy in 2016. Thief: Awwad, 35, was arrested on charges he tried to steal schematics for the under construction Gerald R. Ford aircraft carrier for Egypt . Awwad began working for the Navy last February in the Norfolk Naval Shipyard's nuclear engineering and planning department. He indicated that he understood the computer drawings would be used in Egypt. He also agreed to provide the agent with passport photos to produce a fake Egyptian passport so he could travel without alerting U.S. government officials. The engineer also asked for $1,500 to buy a tiny camera to enable him to photograph restricted material around the shipyard, according to an affidavit. On October 23, Awwad retrieved $3,000 in cash from a pre-arranged drop site along a secluded hiking trail and left behind a container with an external hard drive and two passport photos. The FBI later collected the container. Handcuffs:  Prosecutors said Awwad provided computer drawings downloaded from the Navy to an undercover FBI agent posing as an Egyptian intelligence officer in October . Ship: Awwad tried to steal technical data in the designs of the USS Gerald R. Ford in late October . Awwad was observed at his Navy office on November 28 holding what appeared to be aircraft carrier design schematics, which he placed on the floor and photographed. He is scheduled for a detention hearing on December 10, in federal court in Norfolk. The charges carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison on each count upon conviction.","Mostafa Ahmed Awwad, 35,  was arrested on two counts of stealing .

"David Moyes’ Real Sociedad made it three games without conceding but could only draw the first leg of their last-16 Spanish Cup tie against third tier Oviedo. A third clean sheet will please Moyes but his side will now have to finish the job when they meet again in San Sebastian in two weeks, time just three days after the Basque derby against Athletic Bilbao. Moyes had no luck in the cup at Old Trafford with Manchester United knocked out in the third round against Swansea last season and he watched his side contest a hard-fought goal-less draw at the Carlos Tartiere stadium. Real Oviedo demanded a penalty when Franck Omgba (left) tumbled over Real Sociedad's Alex Callens tackle . The Copa del Rey clash was David Moyes' first since he became Real Sociedad boss in November . Real Oviedo: Esteban, Johannesson, Oscar, J.Vila, David Fdez, Erice, B.Valle (Sergio Garcia 78), Omgba, Cervero (c) (David Gonzalez 60), Sene, Eneko. Subs: Magunazelaia, Nacho Lopez, Generelo. Booked: Cervero, B.Valle, Oscar . Real Sociedad: Rulli, Elustondo (Callens 46), Finnbogason, Pardo, Ansotegi (c), Zurutuza (Oyarzun 66), Castro, Yuri, Zaldua, Gaztanaga, Hervías. Subs not used: Zubikarai, Estrada, Iker Hernandez, Descarte, Aritz Elustondo. Booked: Pardo, Ansotegi . He rested five first team players ahead of this weekend’s visit to Villarreal and a second string side fail to penetrate the second division B team’s defence. Real Sociedad had a penalty shout in the first half when Diego Johannesson looked to have brought down Pablo Hervias inside the area on the half hour but the referee waved away the young winger’s appeals. Hervias was a constant threat for Moyes’ team as Real Sociedad tried to break the deadlock. Midfielder Ruben Pardo, starting the game in place of the rested Markel Bergara and Esteban Granero, also had a deflected shot go just wide before the break but Oviedo defended well and deserved to go in at half-time on level terms. David Zurutuza had the first chance of the second half but the Real Sociedad midfielder headed straight at Oviedo keeper Esteban Suarez after connecting with Chory Castro’s free-kick. Sociedad goalkeeper Geronimo Rulli (right) had to be quick to stop Borja Valle in the second half . Zurutuza went close again with a shot from distance as Real Sociedad pushed for the away goal. They were playing without top scorer Carlos Vela whose hat-trick helped Moyes to his first win at the club last Friday. Leading the line in place of the rested Mexican and the injured Imanol Agirretxe was the Iceland international Alfred Finnbogason and his best chance came on the hour when Castro crossed from the left but from six yards out he failed to beat Esteban.

Ansotegi (left) was promptly booked by the referee after his involvement with Esteban . The Oviedo keeper was in fine form blocking a Castro shot moments later. But the home side were also forcing chances and Josep Sené volleyed over from six yards out. The chance seem to invigorate the minnows and when Franck Omgba tumbled over Alex Callens’ outstretched leg there were calls for a penalty from Oviedo’s players. The referee waved away the appeals and sent coach Sergio Egea off for protesting. The teams take the 0-0 first-leg scoreline into the return game in San Sebastian in two week’s time. The match comes just after three days after the Basque derby with Athletic Bilbao. Moyes may be tempted to play a more first-choice side to ensure progression in the Spanish Cup.","Copa del Rey match was David Moyes' first taste  as Real Sociedad boss .

"It was introduced last Christmas as a special party food treat under the banner of Michelin star chef, Heston Blumenthal. However, the ham hock and piccalilli terrine sold by Waitrose has since proved remarkably elusive. One shopper has revealed that she has tried to order the terrine 13 times in recent months via the supermarket’s website without once seeing it arrive in her kitchen. Scroll down for video . The ham hock and piccalilli terrine sold by Waitrose under the banner of Michelin star chef, Heston Blumenthal, has proved remarkably ellusive . Heston offered a glowing description when the terrine was launched, saying: ‘This is a chunk ham hock and smoked ham mixed with zingy piccalilli – a pork and pickly combo to really get your teeth into.’ The absence of the terrine is something of a mystery and suggests either Waitrose has been unable to keep up with demand or, more worrying for Heston, that production has been restricted because of poor demand. The reviews on the Waitrose website and food blogs offers a distinctly mixed verdict, with some suggesting it has left a nasty taste in the mouth. The single review on the Waitrose website from a woman who lives near Devizes in Wiltshire, appears under the heading ‘Underwhelming’. It adds: ‘Absolutely nothing special about this, nowhere near as good as my own fromage de tête (J Grigson recipe), will not buy again.’ Blumenthal pictured outside his Fat Duck restaurant in, Bray, Berkshire, offered a glowing description when the terrine was launched . A blog on a food lovers website offers an even grimmer description, suggesting the two slices in the pack, ‘do look alarmingly like dog food with a bit of colour added’. It adds: ‘I peeled back the cellophane and it was like someone had just farted in my face.’ The blog concluded: ‘The texture was really good, it wasn’t over processed and had chunks of ham alongside the broken down pulled apart pork, it was a satisfying meaty mouthful. ‘Unfortunately that is where the positives end, because it didn’t taste too good. In fact it tasted just like cheap hot dog sausages.’ However, there were other positive reviews on the web, particularly the Ocado website. One five star rating described it as the ‘nicest pate we’ve had in a long time’. Another reviewer wrote: ‘A rather coarse terrine but tasty all the same. Comes in two slices individually packaged which is extremely handy for picnics or packed lunch. Has a nice mix of flavour with a kick from the pickle.’ A Waitrose spokesman said: 'This is a speciality product and branches don't hold a great deal of stock - so we are sorry this has caused availability problems for this online customer. We are very sorry for any inconvenience caused.'","Heston Blumenthal's ham hock terrine was introduced last Christmas .

"Archaeologists have unearthed hundreds of Roman graves in southwest France, some of which contain skeletons still bound by shackles on their necks and ankles. The incredible excavation is located at a building site about 250m west of the Saintes amphitheatre once used for battles between gladiators and wild animals. Among the hundreds of graves found, five skeletons - four  adults and one child - were found shackled or chained. A skeleton uncovered at the Roman burial site pictured exactly as the individual was buried - with an iron shackle attached to his neck . A wider photo shows the same skeleton - thought to be a man - with a shackle on his ankle as well as his neck . This group of four people were buried head-to-toe in a small, trench-style grave . Dating back to the first and second centuries AD, the grave site is thought to have been an important necropolis used for those massacred at the nearby stadium. Three skeletons were found with iron chains attached to their legs, another was buried in a crude shackle around his neck and a child was found with a device on its wrist. Several of the graves were found to be mass burials - pictures show individuals buried side-by-side, head to toe in trench-style graves. The site was first identified as a possible necropolis last year and scientists are now hoping they can establish the individuals' cause of death. Roman necropoleis were usually constructed in the country as a site for burials and cremations to take place away from tombs built within a city. In this photo, another skeleton can be seen buried with a shackle still attached to its ankle . Unfortunately, the graves at Saintes have yielded almost no artefacts or possessions. Only a few vases were found with the remains of one man, and a child was found with coins resting on his eyes. Roman custom was to place coins on the eyes of the deceased so the person's spirit could pay the ferryman to take them across the river Romans believed divided the world of the living and that of the dead. The period of Roman rule across what is now France is commonly referred to as Gallo-Roman, and the graves discovered in Saintes this week fall within this category. The period in which the graves were used - the first and second centuries AD - corresponds to a time in history when Saintes' was a thriving Roman town. It was established as a regional capital during this period because of its location where the major road between Lyon and Acquitaine met with the Charente River. It is famed for its Roman Colosseum-style arena, which when completed, held up to 18,000 people. Construction on the area started during the reign of Tiberius (14 - 37AD) and finished under Claudius (41 - 54AD). It is the largest and oldest remaining Roman amphitheatre in France.","Archaeologists have discovered hundreds of graves at ancient Roman site .

"A hit man who authorities said was hired by a woman whose three husbands have all died under unusual circumstances has been convicted of second-degree murder in her second spouse's shooting. Alfred 'Terry' Everette, of Mississippi, was convicted on Thursday of gunning down Ernest Smith, 38, in 2006, at the behest of Smith's wife, 50-year-old Emma Raine. Raine has pleaded not guilty in the case and is awaiting trial in March on a second-degree murder charge. Hit man Alfred 'Terry' Everette (pictured right), of Mississippi, was convicted of killing Ernest Smith, 38, in 2006, at the behest of Smith's wife, 50-year-old Emma Raine (left) Mr Smith, a New Orleans preacher, was the second of Raine's three husbands. She has been charged only in Smith's death, but a prosecutor made it clear that the other two deaths were suspicious. 'Her main source of income was killing husbands,' said Assistant District Attorney Laura Rodrigue, who prosecuted the case with her father, District Attorney Leon Cannizzaro. Emma Raine's third husband, James Raine, 37, was shot in their Pearl River, Mississippi, home in 2011. News reports at the time said police were investigating the shooting as a homicide, and that Emma Raine had been out of town at the time. Her first husband, Leroy Evans, was run over by a car in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and then choked to death in his sleep about a year later, in 1994, after his feeding tube was removed. Complicating the case - James Raine has been implicated posthumously in Ernest Smith's death. Prosecutors said James Raine was Emma's boyfriend while she was married to Smith. He also was the foster brother of hit man Everette. Authorities says James Raine had promised Everette up to $100,000 from an $800,000 expected life insurance payment to kill Smith, who was shot outside his New Orleans home. During the trial, a foster brother, Enoch Raine, and two uncles, William and Henry Fowler, all testified that Everette admitted killing Smith when they confronted him two days after James Raine was fatally shot. Everette's defense attorneys, Michael Kennedy and Tanzanika Ruffin, attacked the credibility of Raine's relatives, saying they hoped to benefit from his life insurance policy. 'If James' policy isn't paid to Emma, who gets the money? Ruffin asked the jurors. 'The family does, don't they? Of course they do.' Outside the courtroom, the relatives denied Ruffin's allegations. 'It was never about money,' said Enoch Raine, a Mississippi firefighter. 'Emma and Terry need to be brought to justice for this,' said William Fowler. 'It has messed with our family. We wanted justice for this. We also wanted justice for James.'","Alfred 'Terry' Everette was convicted of killing Ernest Smith, 38, in 2006 at the behest of Smith's wife, 50-year-old Emma Raine .

"‘Good luck finding a Scot,’ smirked one of the bosses in the office when they asked me to choose the all-time greatest combined team from north and south of the border, even as the Auld Enemies gird their loins for this week’s revival of the most ancient fixture in football’s international calendar. Easier than he thinks. The assembling of a mighty composite XI ended up balancing six Englishmen with five Scots. To squeeze in the highest feasible quota of superlative skills requires the selection of a majestic back three in a 3-3-1-3 formation. The starting point, beyond argument, is the Englishman who just happens to be the world's greatest ever goalkeeper: . GORDON BANKS - World Cup winner in 1966, immortalised by that flying save from Pele’s leaping header, stands imposingly at the base of this awe-inspiring team. ALAN HANSEN - one of football’s most cultured centre backs, in his golden years at Liverpool the most decorated of all Scots in the old First Division/Premier League. Gordon Banks won the World Cup for England and makes the No 1 spot and Alan Hansen earns his spot . BILLY McNEILL – the colossus at centre half for Celtic, who he captained to Britain’s first winning of the European Cup. BOBBY MOORE – one of the two greatest defenders of all time, in company with Franz Beckenbauer. The only England captain to raise the World Cup aloft, his statue still guards the gates to Wembley . Scotland's Billy McNeill (left) and England's soon-to-be World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore lead their sides out for a friendly at Wembley in 1965 . GRAEME SOUNESS – tackled like a vice, passed like a laser, scored when it mattered, one of the great all-time, all-round, most-feared midfield men . BRYAN ROBSON – as Captain Marvel for Manchester United and England, embodied all the Souness attributes and was the bravest of never-say-die competitors . Graeme Souness was a tough tackling midfielder for Scotland and here stands over Mark Hateley in 1985 . Bryan Robson was England's Captain Marvel, winning 90 caps for his country . BOBBY CHARLTON – not only the most creative of all English midfield players but also the scorer of stupendous goals, 49 of which still keep him in possession of the England record – after 44 years . PAUL GASCOIGNE – self-destructed before completely fulfilling his phenomenal potential but this maverick remains one of England’s most naturally gifted prodigies . Bobby Charlton (right), shooting against the Scots in 1965, still holds the England goalscoring record with 49 . Paul Gascoigne broke Scottish hearts with this stupendous volley for England at Euro 96 . TOM FINNEY – still the greatest of all English footballers, as deadly at centre forward as he was unplayable on the wing, quite simply a genius . DENIS LAW – scorer of 237 goals for Manchester United and 30 in 55 games for Scotland, the archetypal poacher-striker, widely held to be his country’s second best player ever and their only winner of the Ballon d'Or. Tom Finney heads the ball towards goal in a game against Scotland at Wembley in 1953 . Denis Law celebrates scoring for Scotland against England in 1968 .

"For most parents a set of Lego, a solid climbing frame and well-stocked bookcase would be considered a satisfactory selection of facilities at their child's nursery, but for parents in London's Clapham, it's more than their child's developmental needs that are being met. At the newly opened Clapham Village Nursery, you can drop off your laundry alongside your child in the morning and pick it up ready folded when you come to fetch an expertly-stimulated and (presumably perfectly laundered) child at the end of the day. And there's no stressing about what to make for supper. The nursery will also provide a freshly-cooked meal for the whole family, complete with starter and pudding. A new nursery in Clapham aims to take the stress out of the day for working mums by offering gym classes, laundry services and take-away family suppers . What more could you ask for? How about a choice of yoga, Pilates or boxercise classes so you don't have to rush off to the gym, a selection of tea, coffee and pastries to send you off on your morning commute and IT facilities including computers, ipads and printers at your fingertips? It's all provided at The Village - for a little extra cost, of course. On top of the £80 day rate for children, the adult supplement costs £100 a month, which buys you as many pastries as you can eat, free use of the IT facilities in the 'parent hubb' and four vouchers for the laundry, meal or exercise services. Of course, your children won't do badly either. The nursery has an outdoor beach and tree-house, a fully-equipped mini kitchen and art studio. 'We had a number of meetings with local parents before opening to find out how we could make their life easier and these were some of the aspects that were mentioned,' explains the nursery's manager Malcolm Vickery to the MailOnline. 'Parents feel they're constantly going backwards and forwards so we're trying to reduce their need to rush about,' he adds. The 'parent hub' at Clapham Village Nursery (above) includes a kitchen, stocked with tea, coffee and pastries as well as an IT suite with computers, iPads and printing facilities . The outdoor space at the five-star Clapham Village Nursery allows children to explore their surroundings . Considering that a recent study found that the school or nursery drop-off and cooking dinner for the family were the two most stressful parts of the day, perhaps The Village is onto something. The survey, which was commissioned to mark October's Walk to School Month also found that 83 per cent of parents 'can't cope' juggling drop-offs with getting to work on time. So a little help with the chores, which are often squeezed in before and after drop-off, would no doubt de-stress the day for many a working working mother. But it's not always that simple its it? What about the parents who can't afford to spend £25 a pop on laundering their dirty underpants? Anand . Shukla, Chief Executive of Family and Childcare Trust says more needs to be done for families who aren't on a posh budget. Children at the Clapham Village Nursery can experience real cooking in the mini kitchen . Not just a pot of paint for these lucky tots: the fully-equipped art studio (above) 'Far too . many parents are unable to access childcare that meets their needs,' Shukla tells the MailOnline. 'Where childcare is available, it . is often at a high cost to parents, with parents in Britain paying a . higher proportion of their salary on childcare than all other European . countries except Switzerland. 'Bold . reforms are needed if we are going to achieve high quality childcare that is . affordable and truly meets the needs of modern families,' he adds. Pilates for stressed parents may not be top of the government's proprieties but nurseries that provide auxiliary services for working mothers and reforms that provide more flexibility in the work place could be. But downward dogs and puff pastries aside could ideas like The . Village's 'parent hub' concept also tackle what has been dubbed the 'ghost children' phenomena. Earlier this year the . Association of Teachers and Lecturers Earlier warned that a generation of . children as young as four are stuck in a nursery or school environment for up to ten hours a day without parental touch. Vickery hopes the nursery can go someway . to help parents spend more time with their children. 'The idea is that . parents can tap in and tap out of work all on our premises. Freelancers . use the IT suite as their office and quite often parents who work in an . office use it for conference calls that have to be scheduled at times . that coincide with pick up or drop off, which means they can leave the . office earlier,' he explains. However the nursery does not encourage . parents to make their presence known once they've kissed their little . ones goodbye as it can be 'unsettling for the child'. But Vickery says . the extra facilities mean parents who freelance or work from home can . use the nursery as their office, cutting out journey times and . shortening the hours away from their child. Educational psychologist Hannah Abrahams believes parental presence in the nursery could be beneficial for the children in many ways. 'Anything that encourages parents and carers to work in collaboration and helps communication between the two is good for the children,' she says. The nursery is hoping to cater to parents' needs as well as children's . The slick entrance to Clapham Village Nursery: By creating more facilities for parents on site, they hope parents will be able to spend more time with their children . 'Creating that link between home and nursery can be very useful in managing any difficulties a child might be facing and sharing experiences between parents and carers can have positive affects on their development,' she adds. 'I can also see the appeal for parents. It could feel quite comforting knowing your child is just downstairs - especially if they are young.' But Abrahams agrees that knowing parents are working upstairs could be unsettling for the children. 'It depends on the child, but it could make it harder for children to settle knowing their parents are right there. Part of the experience for children is learning to separate from a parent and understanding that when they say goodbye to you in the morning, you will still come back to collect them at the end of the day.'

"The authors of a study calling for GM crops to be fast-tracked into Britain’s farms and kitchens all have links to the industry, it can be revealed. The report was presented as the work of ‘independent’ scientists and was published on Thursday by a government advisory body. It was used to support a bid to speed up the development of the controversial crops in the UK, but it has emerged that all five authors have a vested interest in promoting GM crops and food – and some are part-funded by the industry. Opposition: Critics of GM described the 'independent' report as 'biased and downright dangerous'. Pictured is an anti-GM protest in 2002 . Critics of GM last night described the report as ‘biased and downright dangerous’, and accused the biotech giants and the Government of mounting a crude propaganda campaign to overturn public opposition. The academics behind the study were chosen by the Council for Science and Technology, the body that advises the Prime Minister on science policy issues. In the report presented at a press conference on Thursday, no information was given about the five scientists beyond their names and the institutions they work for. They include Professor Sir David Baulcombe, from Cambridge University, who works as a consultant for GM firm Syngenta, which gives his department research funding. Syngenta is behind a genetically modified maize or corn, called GA21, which could go into UK farms as early as next spring, making it Britain’s first commercially grown GM crop. Also on the list is Professor Jonathan Jones, of the Sainsbury Laboratory, which is at the centre of Britain’s GM research.  It is part-funded by former Labour science minister, Lord Sainsbury, who is one of the country’s biggest supporters of  the technology. Another co-author was Professor Jim Dunwell, of the University of Reading. He was a founder member of CropGen, which describes its mission as ‘to make the case for GM crops and foods’. The study suggested GM crops could save the hungry in the Third World from starvation and create new plants resistant to disease and pests. 'Sales pitch': Opponents have questioned whether the scientists' conclusions are to be believed . The authors argued that current EU regulation should be re-drawn to allow the UK to go it alone and plant the crops, even if the rest of Europe objects. By contrast, the study pulled a veil over evidence of harm to the countryside, insects and wildlife associated with industrial GM farming practices. The US has seen the emergence of superweeds that are immune to some chemical sprays and are now choking fields. Separately, there has been an absence of research into the health effects of eating GM. A spokesman for GM Watch, Claire Robinson, said: ‘By no stretch of the imagination can these people be described as independent scientists. ‘Their views should be treated with the same scepticism we would apply to any sales pitch.’ Critics say the timing of the release of the study and a supporting letter from the Government’s chief scientist, Sir Mark Walport, are highly suspicious. The details were sent to David Cameron in November – but Sir Mark and ministers delayed going public until now. Food and Farming Secretary Owen Paterson, who is a passionate supporter of GM farming, is trying to convince the EU to allow Britain to plant GM crops even if other states want a ban. The publication of the supposedly independent study calling for exactly this policy is expected to prove useful in those negotiations. The director of GM Freeze, Liz O’Neill, said: ‘A group of scientists with financial interests in the success of GM wrote a letter to the Prime Minister in November but waited four months to tell the Press about it – just in time for EU discussions about regulation. Something certainly smells a bit fishy.’ The administrations in Scotland and Wales have previously made it clear they want nothing to do with GM crops. 'Suspicious': The report is being used to speed up the development of GM crops in the UK . Dr Brian John, of the group GM Free Wales, said: ‘This extraordinary report, published very conveniently to coincide with Owen Paterson’s attempts within the EU to dismantle GM regulations and to repatriate powers to the UK, is in turns naive, biased, disingenuous, cynical and downright dangerous. ‘We find it incredible that five senior scientists can have been  so dismissive of the work of  scores of independent scientists who have discovered that GM organisms are directly and indirectly harmful to mammals and to  the environment. ‘In the world of science there should be respect for those whose findings are “inconvenient”.’ Sir David yesterday confirmed his connection to Syngenta, but said: ‘I am independent in that I am not paid a salary by any corporate organisation. I do receive funding for research in my lab from Syngenta and consult for them – although I do not receive the fee as it goes to a departmental fund.’ Prof Jones said that while  some might question his independence, he was simply ‘very well informed about GM science and technology’. Prof Dunwell said he was a founder of CropGen, but no longer had any ties to the GM lobby group. He added: ‘I am an independent scientist.’ The two other authors were Professor John Pickett, of Rothamsted Research, and Professor Pere Puigdomenech, of the universities of Cambridge and Barcelona. Rothamsted is heavily involved in GM research. Prof Pickett said: ‘I greatly value links with industry, particularly at the technology transfer level, and these are completely transparent interactions.’ Prof Puigdomenech was co-chairman of the seventh International Plant Molecular Biotechnology Congress, sponsored by Monsanto, Bayer and DuPont. He could not be contacted for a comment. Last night, the Science Media Centre, which released the report, insisted the authors were independent. A spokesman said: ‘They are not employed by government or industry and each works for different publicly funded universities and research institutes. For better or worse, it’s not unusual any more for universities and institutions to get bits and pieces of funding from government, charities and industry – indeed many can only access public money on condition that they raise a proportion of their funds from commercial or private sources. ‘This does not automatically undermine their independence.’ But Soil Association chief executive Helen Browning said: ‘It’s really just not good enough for a group of scientists who have a strong interest, it seems, through their funding sources, in persuading a reluctant public to accept the growing of GM crops in the UK, to be the ones who attempt to write the rule book on how that should happen.’ PROFESSOR JONATHAN JONES - Sainsbury Laboratory . Professor Jones proudly wears a T-shirt in his Twitter page image with the slogan: ‘GM food? Am I bovvered? I am not bovvered.’ He is group director at the Sainsbury Laboratory, and is also the founder of and adviser to biotech company Mendel Biotechnology, which counts Monsanto – a GM giant – as a major client. Mendel has been granted more than 20 biotechnology and GM patents. Mendel’s 2009 annual report noted two collaborative partnerships: one with Monsanto and the other with Bayer CropScience. Professor Jones co-founded the UK’s ‘first GM crop company’, Norfolk Plant Sciences, to find ways of commercialising Sainsbury Laboratory’s GM research into a new type of tomato. PROFESSOR SIR DAVID BAULCOMBE - University of Cambridge . Sir David  is a consultant for the GM crop company Syngenta. The fees he receives, which are likely to be many thousands of pounds a year, go into a department fund to support his work. He was previously the head of the Sainsbury Laboratory, which is part of the John Innes Centre (JIC) in Norwich. The Sainsbury Laboratory is at the heart of Britain’s GM research. It has received millions of pounds in donations from Lord Sainsbury, a former Labour science minister and champion of GM. Professor Baulcombe is also Regius Professor of Botany at Cambridge University. PROFESSOR JIM DUNWELL - University of Reading . A founding member of the pro-GM lobby group CropGen in 2000. The group’s stated  mission is to ‘make the case for GM crops and foods by helping to achieve a greater measure of realism and better balance in the UK’s public discussions on agriculture and food’. Professor Dunwell says that he  has not been in contact with CropGen since 2002. However, he remains an advocate for GM. Recently, he wrote an opinion piece in which he accused the EU of slowing down the commercial exploitation of GM crops as a result of ‘unnecessarily tight’ regulation. PROFESSOR JOHN PICKETT - Rothamsted Research Station . He works at Rothamsted Research, which lists biotech firms Aventis, DuPont, Novartis and Syngenta as ‘partners’. Rothamsted, in Hertfordshire, is hosting a trial to grow GM wheat, which contains genes from the mint plant and gives off a scent that deters pests. Professor Pickett suggested the technology could be commercialised to generate money for its developers. In 1998, he was heavily involved  in rubbishing research published by Professor Arpad Pusztai, of Aberdeen’s Rowett Research Institute, which appeared to show that feeding GM potatoes to rats had negative effects on the animals’ stomach lining and immune system. PROFESSOR PERE PUIGDOMENECH - Institute of Molecular Biology at Barceolna CSIC and visiting research fellow at Cambridge . HE has worked closely with Sir David and has links with The Sainsbury Laboratory, the John Innes Centre, and Rothamsted Research Station. Spain is the only country in Europe in which substantial areas are planted with GM maize. Prof Puigdomenech was also co-chairman of the seventh International Plant Molecular Biotechnology Congress, sponsored by Monsanto, Bayer and DuPont.","Government advisory body presented an 'independent' report on Thursday .

"Sunderland defender Wes Brown has warned Manchester City not to take anything for granted as they attempt to succeed where Barclays Premier League leaders Chelsea failed. Jose Mourinho's men left the Stadium of Light with a 0-0 draw - the first time they have failed to score this season - on Saturday evening as the Black Cats turned in a stubborn defensive display and might even have snatched victory in a late flurry of activity. City will follow in their footsteps on Wednesday night when they head for Wearside desperate to end a run of four successive 1-0 league defeats on Wearside, although Brown is looking for more of the same. Sunderland defender managed to keep Chelsea striker Diego Costa quiet at the Stadium of Light . Costa of Chelsea (right) catches Sunderland's Wes Brown with an arm while battling for a header . Asked if Sunderland could extend their remarkable run, the former Manchester United defender said: 'After this result, there's always a possibility. 'Every game, we go into the game looking to win it and if we show the same commitment again, I'm sure we'll have chances. 'If you ask any player which teams they want to play, they'd say the top four or five. I suppose you would be up for it a little bit more and wanting to do really well. 'Everyone is watching and why not play well against the best teams?' Diego Costa's arm connects with the face of Sunderland defender Brown during a challenge in the air . Chelsea arrived in the north east six points clear at the top of the league after a 19-game unbeaten start to the campaign and determined not to allow their hosts a third win on the trot over them inside 12 months. They enjoyed the greater share of the possession, but were rarely able to break through a red and white wall, and although Willian struck a post with a 17th-minute shot, Black Cats defender Santiago Vergini was later denied by the crossbar. Mourinho, who saw striker Diego Costa pick up just a single yellow card - his fifth of the season, which means he will miss Wednesday game against Tottenham - after clashes with central defenders John O'Shea and Brown, was complimentary about Sunderland's defensive resilience and insisted he had nothing for which to reproach his players. Chelsea defender Gary Cahill (left) challenges Sunderland defender O'Shea in the air on Saturday evening . Brown said: 'We made it very difficult. I thought Catts [midfielder Lee Cattermole] was tremendous, like most of the lads, and that gave us a good balance and we showed them they were not going to have it all their own way. 'It helped us. We went in at half-time 0-0 and in the second half, anything can happen. There were a few tired legs, and they had some good chances as well - not perfect chances, but they had a couple of half-chances and then at the end, we probably could have nicked it as well. 'At the beginning of the game, you would have said it would have been a great point earned, but we battled all the way through and then we had a couple of half-chances at the end. Frank Lampard celebrates Manchester City's second at Southampton during the 3-0 win on the south coast . Lee Cattermole robs Eden Hazard of possession during the 0-0 draw against Chelsea on Saturday . 'We are happy with the result. We maybe could have nicked it, but it was a good Chelsea team and we put everything in and managed to stop them scoring and get the draw.' That draw means Sunderland are now unbeaten in four games since their season took an alarming dip with an 8-0 defeat at Southampton and Arsenal's 2-0 victory on Wearside, although Brown insists engineering the transformation has not been complicated. He said: 'If anything, it's just back to basics, doing everything right, not necessarily making it difficult for ourselves, playing simple football, but in a quick way and defending how we know we can defend, where we make it very difficult for teams to score.'","Chelsea were held to a 0-0 draw by a determined Sunderland on Saturday .

"John McEnroe  fanned suggestions that a late-night rumpus with Stan Wawrinka may have contributed to Roger Federer’s late withdrawal from the Barclays ATP World Finals on Sunday night. The world No 2 disappointed more than 17,000 fans at the O2 Arena by pulling out of the final against Novak Djokovic, citing a back injury sustained in his evening semi-final against Wawrinka. But McEnroe also said a post-match spat between the two players, stemming from something Wawrinka said to his opponent’s support bench, would not have helped matters. According to courtside photographers his words were directed either at Federer’s wife Mirka, his father Robbie, or perhaps both. Roger Federer and Stan Wawrinka (right) argued during and after their semi-final match on Saturday . A weary Federer is congratulated by compatriot Wawrinka on Saturday but they argued later on . French TV reported that it had picked up Wawrinka saying: ‘She did the same thing at Wimbledon.’ McEnroe told viewers on ESPN: ‘Afterwards something went on in the locker room, there was a long talk between the players that went on well into the night and the stress of that - I can’t confirm all of this - I don’t think that helped the situation.’ When asked about what happened during the apparent altercation in an unusually feisty third set, Wawrinka replied: ‘Not much, nothing special. Tense match, it’s never easy.’ Roger Federer takes to the court to explain why he couldn't take on Novak Djokovic in the O2 final . ATP executive chairman and president Chris Kermode (right) with Federer as the bad news was delivered . Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho was part of the crowd at the )2 Arena on Sunday . Federer declined to speak to the media on Sunday night after his withdrawal, but apologised to the crowd in person. On Monday Federer and Wawrinka are due to travel to Lille where, starting on Friday, they will make up the Switzerland team that tackles France in the Davis Cup. That is the only major prize in tennis that the Swiss master has not won, and that will incentivise him to quickly smooth things over with his compatriot. Wawrinka’s team were eager to write the tiff off as just one of those things that happen in the heat of battle, while sources in the Federer camp were emphasising that he pulled out of Sunday’s final purely due to the parlous state of his back. Federer looks at his shoes as Wawrinka (right) walks past and off the court on Saturday night . It can only be speculation how much the stress of Saturday’s unexpectedly fractious semi-final contributed to the situation. He and the famously genial Wawrinka have always got on well, although the dynamic in their relationship has changed somewhat this year through the latter’s surge into the elite. He even rated at Swiss No 1 for a time this year before Federer’s excellent run of results. The 17-time Grand Slam winner told the O2 crowd that something pulled in his back during the decisive tiebreak. ‘I have tried treatment on it, medication, tried to turn it round as quickly as possible but I didn’t really feel that much of an improvement,’ said Federer, who does not know how it will affect his chances next weekend. ‘I can’t compete at this level with Novak, it would be too risky at my age to do this right now.’ It was typical Federer class to front up before the disappointed crowd, and in his whole career it is only the third time he has pulled out of a match. Novak Djokovic holds his Tour Finals trophy after a presentation before his exhibition match . VIDEO Djokovic surprised by Federer withdrawal to hand him title . He only gave up the struggle an hour before the final, and by then Chris Kermode, the ATP’s executive chairman, had gone into crisis management mode. He called Andy Murray at his Surrey home at 2pm to ask him to play a replacement exhibition singles against Djokovic, and a lighthearted doubles with Tim Henman, John McEnroe and Pat Cash. ‘He instantly offered to help, he didn’t ask for a fee and wasn’t offered one,’ revealed Kermode, adding that the others had also volunteered to entertain the crowd, which included the likes of Jose Mourinho and Hugh Grant, for free. Given that the doubles final (won by the Bryan brothers) took place along with the exhibitions, Kermode said there would be a partial refund and priority booking next year for ticket holders, who had paid up to £110 for their seats. As this event makes around £10million profit, it is only right. Federer won a taxing semi-final against Stan Wawrinka in a tie-break after two hours and 48 minutes . Overall a good job was done in managing Federer’s non-appearance, although Murray, who lost 6-0, 6-1 to the Swiss earlier in the week, could see the funny side. ‘I have to apologise because clearly I pushed Roger so hard on Thursday,’ the Scot quipped. However, questions might again be asked about how fair it is for one semi-final to be played on Saturday afternoon and another on Saturday night, which happens at many ATP events. It all capped what has been an unfortunate week, which saw so many one-sided matches - not a vintage year. At the end of it all Djokovic was left champion for the third year running, and is very much the man to beat next season.

"While many believed that this season's title race was turning in to a procession for Jose Mourinho's unbeaten Chelsea, Manchester City's recent resurgence has set up an enthralling fight to the finish. Chelsea's 3-0 victory over Tottenham  meant the Blues maintained a six-point lead at the top of the table but free-scoring performances against Southampton and Sunderland have seen Manuel Pellegrini's City stake their intentions.

KEOWN ON THE DEFENSIVE UNITS . Thibaut Courtois’ mistakes are minimal and it never seems to be his fault when Chelsea concede — I’m not sure you can say the same about Joe Hart. Terry and Cahill are formidable and Ivanovic and Azpilicueta solid. Kompany is terrific but, Zabaleta apart, the rest are inconsistent. But the key is the work done in front of them. Chelsea’s pressing and the screen Matic provides means it’s almost impossible to isolate their defenders. City on the other hand are too often left exposed. CHELSEA 8/10 MAN CITY 7/10 .

When everybody is fit, there is very little to choose between these two midfields. Signing Fabregas was a statement of intent and he has given Chelsea subtlety and class. They have lost Lampard’s goals but Fabregas’ assists make up for it. Hazard could get into any team in the world and Matic is a perfect shield. City have struggled to find that balance but injuries have disrupted them. People called Yaya Toure useless and unfit, but he scores a few and all of a sudden he’s purring and David Silva, when he’s fit, is a genius. CHELSEA 9/10 CITY 9/10 .

I said a few weeks ago the title race could be a shootout between Sergio Aguero and Diego Costa. Nothing has changed! Costa has adapted so quickly and he plays on the edge, but I like that. Didier Drogba is useful as Jose’s eyes in the dressing room and Loic Remy provides good back-up. Aguero is on fire and now he’s staying fit his scoring rate is incredible. Edin Dzeko is hit-and-miss and Stevan Jovetic has chipped in, but Aguero has carried City at times.

"A young athlete who dreamed of playing college basketball will get her chance to start in her first game - even though she has an inoperable brain tumor and just weeks to live. Lauren Hill, 19, of Lawrenceburg, Indiana, was a standout high school player who committed to playing at Mount St. Joseph’s University, also in Indiana, in October of last year. Then, last November, she found out she had an inoperable brain tumor. Scroll down for video . Hoop dreams: Lauren Hill (center in uniform) has an inoperable brain tumor and just weeks to live, but will get to play her first college basketball game at Mount St. Joseph's on November 1 . Inspiration: The teenager, who was a high school standout (left) and prom queen (right) has stayed positive despite her diagnosis . While doctors at first gave the teenager two years to live, a recent MRI showed that her tumor had grown, and she now just has weeks left. Not that even that was enough to stop Hill, who has Diffused Intrinsic Pentene Gleoma, a cancer with roots at the base of her brain stem with growing tentacles weaving through her nerves. 'I never gave up for a second even when I got a terminal diagnosis; never thought about sitting back and not living life anymore,' she told Local 12. And now she will be getting to fulfill her dream of playing college ball, thanks to some help from her school and the NCAA. During her surprise birthday party on October 1, exactly one year from the date she signed to play at Mt. Saint Joseph's, Hill learned that the school contacted the NCAA who agreed to move up their opening game against Hiram College from November 15 to November 1 so she can take the court. It will be her first, and last, time playing college basketball. Hope: Instead of being scared of death, Hill (above with mother Lisa) says she is just excited about getting to play basketball for her team just once . Mount Saint Joe's basketball coach, Dan Benjamin, said, 'She's a special person. This girl is so strong, she's dealing with death and all she's thinking about is everyone else. Her team first her family first, and just to give her that one last wish would be incredible for our program and our players.' As for Hill, those few weeks she has left won't be filled with fear or tears it seems, but rather excitement and hope. Said the teenager, 'I love the roar of the crowd, the squeaking of the shoes. I can't wait to be on this court and wearing #22.'","Lauren Hill, a college freshman at Mount St. Joseph's, will get to play her first college basketball game on November 1 .

"To the cheers of her family and the ka-thunk of her 77-year-old car, a 91-year-old Northern California woman recently made good on a bucket-list wish to once again steer the 1937 Ford coupe she learned to drive in. Clara Mae Blasingame, a long-retired schoolteacher, had repeatedly expressed nostalgia for the black Ford she had inherited from her father, Blasingame's two sons, Ron and Ken Blasingame, told the Santa Rosa Press Democrat. 'She wanted to drive it once again before she went home,' Ken Blasingame told the newspaper. Scroll down for video .

Blasingame's sons tweaked the engine - a replacement transplanted decades ago from a Ford Mustang - enough to get the car running again, barely.

"Click here for more stats and heat maps from Sportsmail's fantastic Match Zone service . Well, the atmosphere was certainly better, although the performance took a while to warm-up. And this time Jose Mourinho took out his frustration on his players rather than the Chelsea supporters as he fumed on the touchline. Mourinho criticised his players after hauling off Andre Schurrle and Willian at half-time and Filipe Luis once Maribor, a team thumped 6-0 at Stamford Bridge last month, had taken the lead with a brilliant goal. Diego Costa, Oscar and Ramires - who he had hoped to keep fresh for Saturday's game at Liverpool - were scrambled as was an unusual three-at-the-back system in a bid to rescue pride.

They emerged with a point after an equaliser by Nemanja Matic and they would have taken all three had Eden Hazard not missed a penalty, five minutes from time. Mourinho praised Maribor and grumbled about the Italian officials who ruled a late goal by Costa to be offside and only added two minutes of stoppage time at the end, when he clearly thought he should have been be more. Generally, the he cut a disgruntled figure and his mood was not enhanced when the travelling fans, offended by his remarks that the Bridge had been like an 'empty stadium' during last Saturday's win against QPR, started to tease him. 'Cheer up Mourinho,' they sang, in the first half, and then: 'Jose Give us a Song'. They left him alone once it was clear the manager was not amused. When asked to comment on the songs, he shook his head and said: 'Forget it'. At the end of the game, he congratulated Maribor boss Ante Sumundza and then stalked straight down the tunnel as John Terry led the players to salute the 600 Chelsea supporters who made the trip. At half-time, Mourinho had made the same purposeful march across the pitch and into the dressing rooms, staring at the floor with clipboard tucked under his arm like a man about to deliver a few home truths. One of his backroom staff emerged moments later, sent to retrieve the electronic board used by the fourth officials to indicate substitutions. 'In the first half we were not good,' said Mourinho. 'Very slow; no intensity, no creativity. It was easy for Maribor to control the game and reach what they wanted to reach, a 0-0. 'I tried to improve my team. When you try to improve your team, sometimes it's for tactical reasons. Other times it's for individual performances. I think I was successful with the changes I did. 'In the second half the team were much better than in the first half. I thought we played magnificently: creative, fast, good dynamic, a lot of chances to score. Only when Maribor scored did the players realise the game was in danger. After that, a fantastic reaction. 'We deserved to win, clearly.We didn't reach the number of goals that we should have in the second half, but the team played well. And we scored a great second goal.'

No English side won a single group match this week, the first time that happened since November 5, 2008. The 'second goal' was a reference to the disallowed goal prodded in by Costa moments before Hazard's 85th-minute penalty miss. It looked very tight, perhaps marginally onside, and he did not miss the chance to take a swipe at referee Daniele Orsato. They have history stretching back to Mourinho's time with Inter Milan. 'We scored two goals, two very good goals,' said the Chelsea boss. 'The second goal, the referee decided to disallow but it's a clear goal. Normally we should win because we scored two goals. But we have to accept it and to praise a fantastic stadium with lots of enthusiasm. 'For the people, it was a fantastic night, and Maribor gave everything. They fought. They had a fantastic goalkeeper. And the referee's team didn't have a good night.'

Perhaps it had all felt a little too comfortable because, after scoring six against the Slovenians in London. The Barclays Premier League leaders started well, creating chances and missing them until Kurt Zouma was forced to clear off the goal-line from Sintayehu Sallalich. Confidence washed through the home team and they passed the ball with more assurance. Sallalich caused problems with his pace and trickery and Agim Ibraimi's goal was a delicious piece of skill, curled into the top corner with his left foot from wide on the Maribor right past Petr Cech. It was the first time Chelsea had been behind since September 13 against Swansea. Mourinho made his third substitution and switched to a three-man defence, with Hazard at wing-back. Maribor ought to have doubled the lead when Mitja Viler's cross from the left found Luka Zahovic at the far post. The teenager only had to tap it in, but somehow lifted it over the goal. Here was an escape for Chelsea, and they took advantage by summoning a strong finish. The leveller came from Matic with 17 minutes left after Terry had headed a corner from Cesc Fabregas towards goal. Hazard came to life but could not find a finish and Costa was denied, and that goal that never was. Oscar thought he might have won a penalty and yet Maribor could have won it when Tavares fired wide after a break by Sallalich.

Amid the chaotic closing spell, Hazard was tripped by Viler, climbed to his feet and saw his spot-kick saved by Jasmin Handanovic. It summed the night up. Maribor clung on and the home crowd could barely contain their joy, chanting, jumping, burning flares and waving their giant flags. At the end they did not want to leave. They have never seen anything like it. For Chelsea, as the dust settled, it did not seem quite so bad. They remain top of Group G, in a good position to qualify and remain unbeaten in 16 games this season in all competitions.

"Sir John Armitt argued power blackouts are the 'best possible' thing for the country . One of Ed Miliband’s most senior advisers sparked fury yesterday by saying that power blackouts would be good for the country. Sir John Armitt argued that the blackouts would be the ‘best possible thing’ because they would bring home the scale of the energy crisis facing the country. Sir John’s inflammatory remarks – which coincided with forecasts of the first Arctic blast of the winter – revived the fierce debate over energy prices and supplies which was triggered by Mr Miliband’s party conference pledge in October to freeze gas and electricity bills. The Conservatives immediately lept on Sir John’s comments, claiming that blackouts would be an indictment of Mr Miliband’s failure to plan for the future when he was Energy Secretary. Sir John, who is advising Labour on the future of the country’s long-term infrastructure needs, said: ‘In harsh political terms [blackouts] would be the best possible thing because this country is extremely good in a crisis.’ In the interview with construction industry magazine Building, he added that the UK was nearing the crisis because too little was being done to replace ageing coal-fired and nuclear power stations. He said: ‘We are down to (just a) 4 per cent (surplus of energy capacity) because we’ve gone slower than we should have done on nuclear.’ His remarks are particularly  controversial because of the continuing fury within the energy industry over Mr Miliband’s plans for an energy price freeze. Energy bosses said that his move would threaten the security of supply and mean ‘the lights would go out’. The comments have revived the debate surrounding Labour party leader Ed Miliband's promise to freeze gas and electricity bills . Tory MP Charlie Elphicke said: ‘Labour had 13 years to take the long-term decisions to meet Britain’s energy needs, including when Ed Miliband was Energy Secretary, but failed to do so. 'Instead they took short-term decisions. And now Labour’s key economic adviser thinks it would be a good thing for families, vulnerable older people, and even hospitals treating patients to suffer power cuts.’ Last night, Energy Minister Greg Barker said: ‘This is utter madness, but if Sir John thinks power cuts will be a good thing for Britain then he is certainly working for the right man – because Ed Miliband would deliver them.’","Senior adviser said blackouts would bring home scale of energy crisis .

"This is the moment a pensioner had to be rescued after 'deliberately' driving into the sea in front of tourists at millionaires' resort Sandbanks. The woman sat motionlessly as the water poured into her Volkswagen Golf off the Dorset coast today. Witnesses described how she wound down both front windows of her car before speeding down a ferry slipway and into the water at around midday. The silver car was swept 100 yards out to sea by the fast tide the unnamed woman refused to move despite cries from the quayside to get out as it went down. Scroll down for video . Rescue: This is the moment a woman had to be rescued after apparently driving deliberately into the sea off Sandbanks . Submerged: The VW sank  yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp on the Sandbanks peninsula . Rescue: The woman is led away to safety by RNLI and emergency workers after she was freed from the sinking car . Drama: The woman's car had to be dragged from the water shortly after she herself was pulled from the car . Lucky to be alive: The unnamed woman was rescued by fishermen who jumped into the sea and dragged her out . But the crew  of a passing fishing boat then dived into the water and pulled the woman free just moments before her vehicle sank. The soaked casualty was lifted on board next to the Sandbanks to Studland chain ferry - which sits yards from the home of Premier League football manager Harry Redknapp. After being pulled to safety  her rescuers went back to the sinking vehicle to retrieve the woman's handbag. Witness Steve Chater-Lea, 45, said the woman drove past a queue of cars waiting for the ferry before heading down the slope at speed. He said: 'She drove past the ferry queue and accelerated down the ramp. It was definitely deliberate, you could tell from the way she revved the engine and the force with which she hit she the water. 'Both her windows were down and you could see her just sat there oblivious to people shouting out to her to get out. She made no movement or attempt to leave the car. 'There were 20 or 30 people stood on the quay about 15 feet away shouting for her to get out. 'There was a strong outgoing tide and the car went about 100 yards towards the sea, getting lower and lower in the water. 'A fishing boat came alongside the car but she still wouldn't get out and one of the crew dived in and pulled her out of the passenger side. 'She was alive and taken to the jetty for the Brownsea Island ferry and into an ambulance.' Shock: Witnesses described how the motorists sped down this ferry ramp and crashed into the water . Fear: This picture was taken shortly after the car went into the sea and quickly it was swept 100 yards out . Witnesses: People on the busy ferry crossing the estuary also captured the moment the boat began to sink . Brave: Workers on a passing fishing vessel saw the woman and dived in to save her from the deep water . This barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water . Damage: The car's bumper and windscreen were both smashed  in the impact with the water . Holidaymaker Bob Smallman said: 'I saw the car in the water and we were all screaming for her to get out but she was just holding on to the steering wheel. 'A fishing boat went round to get her out but she didn't want to go, she looked frightened. They were dragging her in the water for a bit. 'They managed to get her out before the car went completely underwater. 'An inflatable boat that took her to safety then went back to the car and rescued her handbag before it sunk. She must have told them about her bag and been adamant they needed to get it.' Witness Ash Naik said 'I was on the phone talking to my friend ad just said 'I have to go'. 'I saw her flying down the ferry jetty really fast. She jumped the queue of traffic and just shot off the end. She was going so fast one of her wipers came off. 'The car windows were open and the car started to sink when it hit the water but she just sat there and didn't move. 'Someone threw a life-ring in the water but she didn't try to get it. One guy jumped in but she was clung onto the door. They pulled her into the boat.' The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia. The woman was taken to hospital where she was treated for shock and the effects of hyperthermia . Busy: Numerous families with children on school half-term and other tourists were on the quayside and surrounding area when the woman drove in . Solent coastguard said they were called in and the woman and the car were both recovered safely . The roof of the submerged car could be seen a few inches beneath the surface of the water. A barge with a lifting crane on arrived on the scene about an hour later and hoisted the sunken vehicle out of the water. Numerous families with children on school half-term were on the quayside and witnessed the incident at 11.58am today. A spokesman for Solent coastguard said: 'A lady driving a Volkswagen car managed to go into the water off the slipway. 'She has been recovered safely. The car was located 30 metres offshore and collected by a local fishing vessel. A spokesman for the Bournemouth-Swanage Motor Road and Ferry Company, which operates the chain ferry, confirmed the ferry had left the Sandbanks slipway and was halfway across the entrance to Poole Harbour at the time. In 2005, a 30-year-old woman deliberately drowned herself by driving off the same slipway into the sea. Helen Hogan lit a cigarette while she waited for her Rover 416 car to sink with her inside it.","Witnesses describe how woman drove into the water off Dorset at speed .

"An Illinois auction house says it is selling the revolver that almost killed former Alabama Governor George Wallace. Rock Island Auction Company specializes in rare firearms. It listed the revolver for sale on Friday. Company vice president Judy Voss says it's the same gun used to shoot Wallace during a 1972 assassination attempt. Voss says the serial number on the gun matches that listed on police reports. Voss says a date etched in to the gun also matches law enforcement records. Governor George Wallace blocks the entrance to the University of Alabama as he turned back a federal officer attempting to enroll two black students at the university campus in Tuscaloosa, Alabama in 1963 . The gun that almost killed former Alabama Gov. George Wallace in an assassination attempt in 1972, is being sold by an Illinois auction house . In this June 11, 1963 photo, Vivian Malone and James Hood stand in the doorway of Foster Auditorium where they hold what they called their 'first and final news conference' after the two African-American students registered at the University of Alabama . Arthur Bremer shot Wallace during a Maryland stop as the governor campaigned for president. It left Wallace paralyzed from the waist down. The auction company gave a presale estimated value of between $15,000 and $30,000. Voss did not say who was selling the gun. Nine years before his assassination, one of the most iconic moments in the history of America's civil rights movement took place with the infamous 'stand in the schoolhouse door'. It was on June 11, 1963, when then governor George Wallace tried to stop two black students from registering for classes at the University of Alabama. Governor George Wallace, right, attempted to prevent James Hood and Vivian Malone from registering for classes at the university in 1963 . President John F Kennedy, who ordered Wallace to stand aside, delivers a speech at a rally in Fort Worth, Texas, several hours before his assassination in 1963 . Alabama Governor George C. Wallace and his wife Cornelia. The Governor was paralyzed from the waist down by one one of four gunshot wounds he suffered while campaigning at a shopping center in Maryland . He stood in the door at the university's Foster Auditorium and, in defiance of federal law, refused Vivian Malone and James Hood entry. When federal marshals intervened, he stood firm and delivered an impassioned speech against desegregation. Wallace eventually relented when a U.S. general acting under orders issued by President John F Kennedy demanded he make way. Malone and Hood then entered. The incident brought Wallace into the national spotlight and led to the desegregation of the university as Malone and Hood made history by becoming the first black students to enroll.

Former four-term Alabama Governor George Wallace in an emotional moment in 1994 as he hugged friend Connie Harper at a celebration of Wallace's 75th birthday. Wallace's daughter, Peggy Wallace Kennedy, said her family has lived in the shadow of the schoolhouse door ever since . George Wallace's symbolic attempt to stop black students enrolling followed his inaugural promise of 'segregation now, segregation tomorrow, segregation forever' and stop the desegregation of schools. Eleven years earlier, the U.S. Supreme Court handed down its landmark decision in Brown Vs Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas, in which it was argued the education of black children separate from white children was unconstitutional. The Brown case meant the University of Alabama had to be desegregated. But in the years that followed hundreds of African-Americans applied for admission, but all were denied. The university worked with police to find any disqualify them, or when this failed, intimidated the applicants. But in 1963, three African-Americans with perfect qualifications - Vivian Malone Jones, Dave McGlathery and James Hood - applied, and refused to be intimidated. In early June a federal district judge ordered that they be admitted, and forbade Governor Wallace from interfering. Then on June 11, Malone and Hood arrived to register, with Wallace attempting to uphold his promise. Federal marshals told Wallace to step aside but Wallace cut Katzenbach off and refused, giving a speech on States' rights. It took General Henry Graham to command Wallace to step aside, saying: 'Sir, it is my sad duty to ask you to step aside under the orders of the President of the United States.' Wallace, who survived an assassination attempt that left him in a wheelchair, died in 1998 having renounced segregationism.","Gun’s serial number was checked with the police records and it was confirmed to be the same weapon used in the attempted killing of Wallace .

"Manchester United are ready to spend another £150million next summer to complete the Gaal-actico revolution at Old Trafford. United are convinced they are heading in the right direction under Louis van Gaal and want to copy the Real Madrid blueprint by having an elite player in every position. After backing the Dutchman by making six signings last summer — including smashing the British transfer record to sign Angel di Maria for £59.7m — the club are preparing for another massive investment, with senior sources insisting that the rebuilding has only just begun. Manchester United boss Louis van Gaal, waving to the crowd, looks set to continue an overhaul of his squad . Bayern Munich and Holland star Arjen Robben is a potential target of Van Gaal's at Old Trafford . United have spent £215m on players since September 2013 in a bid to reverse the alarming decline of the past 18 months, and another spree on the scale of last summer would take their investment beyond £350m. Van Gaal has made centre back, right back and winger his main target areas. United have not ruled out making signings in the January transfer window — as was the case with Juan Mata’s £37.1m arrival from Chelsea at the start of this year — but suspect they will have to wait until the summer to find the right players. The list includes Barcelona right back Dani Alves, Bayern Munich winger Arjen Robben, central defenders Mats Hummels of Borussia Dortmund and Diego Godin of Atletico Madrid, and Roma defensive midfielder Kevin Strootman. Roma's Kevin Strootman (left) and Barcelona's Dani Alves could be set for moves to Man United . Kevin Strootman (Roma) - Likely fee: £30m . The Roma midfielder, 24, might have been a United player already had he not suffered a knee injury in March and the club have retained a strong interest. Diego Godin (Atletico Madrid) - Likely fee: £28.5m . The experienced Atletico Madrid centre back, 28, is on United’s list of targets but they would have to trigger the £28.5m release clause in his contract. Dani Alves (Barcelona) - Likely fee: Free . United want elite players and signing the 31-year-old Brazil right back, out of contract at Barca next summer, would be a coup. Mats Hummels (Borussia Dortmund) - Likely fee: £32m . United’s inquiry for the Germany centre-back, 25, was rebuffed last summer but the Old Trafford paymasters are ready to try again. Arjen Robben (Bayern Munich) - Likely fee: £20m . Van Gaal has made little secret of his desire to be reunited with the Bayern Munich winger, 30, a key member of his Holland squad at the World Cup. As Borussia Dortmund struggle at the bottom of Bundesliga, Mats Hummels could seek a transfer . Atletico Madrid centre back Diego Godin has been highlighted as a transfer target at OId Trafford . United also have a big decision to make over striker Radamel Falcao, who will cost a further £46m on top of his £6m loan fee if his move from Monaco is made permanent. The Colombia striker has struggled with injury so far, scoring just once. A fresh influx of signings will be followed by another major clear-out after 20 players were cut from the first-team squad last summer. Reserve goalkeeper Anders Lindegaard could be the first to go in January, paving the way for United to offer a contract to former Barcelona No 1 Victor Valdes who has been training at Carrington as he recuperates from a serious knee-ligament injury. United have decided to keep Anderson until the end of his contract in the summer rather than give him a £1.4m pay-off next month, but a number of Brazilian clubs are interested in taking the midfielder back to his homeland and Old Trafford sources are optimistic a buyer can be found. Striker Radamel Falcao needs to prove his fitness in order to force a permanent move to Manchester United . Mexican Javier Hernandez celebrates scoring for Real Madrid, where he is on loan this season . Robin van Persie, who has one year left on his contract, has only scored four goals for United this season . Nani has been in impressive form on loan at Sporting Lisbon but United are unlikely to recall the Portugal winger and will look to sell to any club prepared to take on his wages of £120,000 a week. Javier Hernandez, Tom Cleverley, Wilfried Zaha and Nick Powell are also out on loan and unlikely to return. Darren Fletcher is out of contract at the end of the season, while Robin van Persie, Ashley Young, Phil Jones, Chris Smalling and Rafael will have one year left on their deals. It means that up to 10 players could leave Old Trafford in addition to last summer’s exodus. That represents a massive turnover for a club that grew accustomed to stability under Sir Alex Ferguson. Chris Smalling (top) could be one of 10 Manchester United players to leave the club in January or the summer . Juan Mata , who has recently regained his top form, was a January window signing from Chelsea this year . However, United are satisfied with the way Van Gaal has overhauled the squad and remain confident they can return to the European elite with the right investment and approach. Despite a poor start, the new manager has taken his team into fourth place in the Premier League table after signing Di Maria, Falcao, Ander Herrera, Daley Blind, Marcos Rojo and Luke Shaw in the summer. Two players United do want to keep are goalkeeper David de Gea and Michael Carrick. De Gea has matured into one of the best goalkeepers in Europe since joining United in the summer of 2011 but the Spaniard will be out of contract in 18 months time. Goalkeeper David de Gea has been in inspirational form Manchester United so far this season . That has alerted Real Madrid but a United source insisted they are ‘completely relaxed’ over De Gea’s situation, even though negotiations with his representatives have yet to begin in earnest. The club also have an option to extend Carrick’s contract by a further 12 months and seem likely to do so following the veteran midfielder’s return from ankle surgery. Meanwhile, United have yet to decide whether to arrange a prestige friendly abroad or a warm-weather training trip to the Middle East in January and will leave the final decision to Van Gaal.","Louis van Gaal set to add key players to his Manchester United side .

"President Barack Obama and the first family have lit the national Christmas tree. And this time, his daughters Sasha and Malia remembered to smile. Flanking their father, their mother Michelle, and their maternal grandmother Marian Robinson, the teenagers beamed as they clustered around the light switch just feet away from the White House. SCROLL DOWN FOR VIDEO . Joyful joyful! The entire first family looked full of Christmas spirit at the annual tree-lighting ceremony . The big moment: Malia, 16, beamed out at the crowds and Sasha, 13, stared excitedly at the light-switch as their father told citizens to remember those on military service when they look at the tree, a symbol of hope . Not so spritely: The first daughters' sullen expressions on Thanksgiving prompted a wave of reaction . It was a welcome change after the pair appeared less than festive at the annual turkey pardon for Thanksgiving, which prompted former Republican communications officer Elizabeth Lauten to call them 'classless'. Her controversial comments sparked outrage and Lauten's subsequent resignation. There was no sign of sullenness on Thursday night's event though - both girls, wrapped up warm in J Crew coats, were seen smiling and giggling. Michelle read from The Night Before Christmas at the event hosted by Tom Hanks and his wife Rita Wilson, while the major musical performances came from singers Patti LaBelle and Steve Miller . In his address, Obama said the national tree is a 'symbol of hope and holiday spirit.' He urged Americans to remember members of the U.S. military serving overseas, as well as their families. Glittering: The ceremony was the 92nd to be held outside the White House, with crowds gathered to watch . Joking around: The scene was a change in tone from Malia and Sasha's somber attitude on Thanksgiving . The moment: The girls, both wrapped up warm in J Crew coats, pushed the button together to turn on the glittering red, white and green light display . Hundreds gathered to watch the 47-foot tree light up before speeches and festive story-telling . Support: The Obama girls were accused of failing to show their father support on Thanksgiving but their jovial attitude on Thursday night, walking arm-in-arm with their father, sent a clear message to their critics . 'As we hold our loved ones tight, let's remember the military families whose loved ones are far from home,' Obama said. 'They are our heroes.' There followed performances from artists including singer NE-YO, pop performers Nico & Vinz, singing group The Tenors, and country singer Chely Wright. This year's ceremony marks the 92nd annual lighting of the Christmas tree just steps from the White House. The tradition was started by President Calvin Coolidge in 1923, according to the National Parks Service. A festive kiss: Tom Hanks planted a kiss on Michelle Obama's cheek as they celebrated the annual event .

"Lewis Hamilton — forlorn, curt and quiet-voiced — had rarely looked more vulnerable than as he left the paddock to spend a night alone with his hopes and thoughts. The world championship is still his to lose. He is 17 points ahead of his Mercedes colleague Nico Rosberg — who took pole — and will start only one place behind him on the grid at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. If he finishes where he starts — second — he will be enshrined in Formula One history as only the fourth Briton to win two championships. Graham Hill is one, the others are Jim Clark and Sir Jackie Stewart, the last to accomplish the feat 43 years ago. Lewis Hamilton appeared vulnerable ahead of the final race of the season at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix . Hamilton will battle Mercedes team-mate Nico Rosberg for the drivers' championship on Sunday . Hamilton qualified in second place and will win the title if he can finish in the same position . But to observe Hamilton here after Rosberg’s virtuoso lap was not to see a man happily embracing his destiny. Damon Hill, the 1996 champion and son of Graham, summed it up perfectly: ‘Nico is doing everything — and I mean everything — to get the high ground over Lewis. Lewis looks sometimes as if Nico is getting to him. I am concerned about that for Lewis’s sake.’ Rosberg was 0.386sec faster in qualifying, giving him an 11th pole to his rival’s seven this season. Hamilton, a venerated one-lap specialist, must find that perturbing and inexplicable. Both men made a few mistakes over the three sessions. Hamilton locked up and ran far on to the kerbs; Rosberg ran dramatically wide in the second session. When he set the fastest lap, Rosberg’s wife Vivian and the Mercedes’ hierarchy celebrated. The man himself put up a thumb and thrust a forearm out as he drove back into the pit lane. It was a gesture of intent. Rosberg celebrates after wining his 11th pole position of the season with the fastest qualifying lap . Rosberg is still in contention for the championship as double points are on offer in the season finale . The German driver appeared more confident as the season reaches its nail biting conclusion . This title fight is now going to be won as much in the six inches between the ears as the 3.47 miles of hot track. And Rosberg seems to be winning the psychological battle. ‘Pressure,’ said the German, ‘is one of the hopes that I have, a bit like today and in the last race in Brazil. ‘They are the kind of opportunities I am looking for. I am pushing to keep the [pressure] level extremely high. Lewis has everything to lose; I have everything to gain, so the pressure is on him.’ Hamilton has made a virtue of having no friends or family with him in the paddock here. There is just him and his Finnish trainer Ville Vihola. But is his singular approach really a help? Or did he miss the companionship of more familiar faces when the going got tough under the night’s sky? By contrast, Rosberg’s little throng of friends tucked into beer and pasta on a table outside the Mercedes hospitality area. They clapped when their man walked over with his plate of rice and chicken. Hamilton had to suffice with the brief company of rapper Pharrell Williams, their meeting making the British driver so late for his 7pm engineering debrief that technical director Paddy Lowe had to fetch him. Rosberg walked briskly there, sipping his water bottle. The up-and-at-‘im attitude was obvious. There are several permutations but Hamilton will be assured victory if he finishes second . Hamilton speaks with international artist Pharrell Williams (left) behind the scenes in Abu Dhabi . Hamilton takes time out to pose for a picture with Williams and Tyrese Gibson (right) How the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix course is set up . So was Hamilton’s dejection. ‘I don’t know whether he puts on looking sad,’ said Hill. ‘His body language in the post-qualifying interview told me he could hardly bare to sit next to Nico. ‘It’s not dislike; it’s just very difficult emotionally to cope with this type of situation. It’s a total psychological game. That’s all it is.’ We should not lose sight of the fact that Hamilton remains favourite for the title. The maths favours him: if he finishes first or second there is nothing Rosberg can do about it, even with the absurdity of the points counting double. And coming in the top two should be straightforward enough so quick are their cars. Yet the Williamses of Valtteri Bottas and Felipe Massa will start third and fourth and cannot be discounted. If Hamilton should not get cleanly through the first corner in at least second place, he is liable to be caught in the scramble behind. Hill knows the dangers of this better than most. For he admits he was ‘not on full attack’ when he led the standings going into his title decider in 1996 and was hit by Gerhard Berger’s Benetton. Former world champion has questioned whether Hamilton has got his tactics clear ahead of the race . Hamilton races as night falls in Abu Dhabi in his quest to be crowned drivers' champion for a second time . Hamilton's racing style does not lend itself to driving for second place . ‘It’s like golf,’ said Hill. ‘The hard bit comes when you get nearer the hole. It’s the 50-yard chip with a half swing. I am not sure Lewis is so good at that.’ Hamilton is supreme as an all-out attacker but that is not his task here. He seems confused about what tactic to employ. Asked how he would conduct the race, he offered a brief response: ‘Same as always.’ Fine, but later, when asked whether he would race for second, he said: ‘You are right it’s not my style. But we will decide tomorrow.’ A couple of hours later, he was a touch more relaxed. ‘I don’t really pay much attention to Nico,’ he said. ‘Of course Nico, for sure, is trying everything possible in his head to come up with some kind of way of dealing with things I guess. That’s just how he deals with it. I just keep things to myself and do my talking on the track.’ Hamilton gives a thumbs up after qualifying, although having Valtteri Bottas behind him could be a concern . Hamilton and Rosberg share the stage together - but who will be standing on the winner's podium? Hamilton takes his Mercedes around the track for the final time before judgement time . By late evening, the Red Bulls were under investigation after the technical delegate Jo Bauer spotted the front wings of the cars driven by Daniel Ricciardo and Sebastian Vettel, due to be fifth and sixth on the grid, were flexing illegally. They were relegated down the grid, so Jenson Button of McLaren moved up to sixth and now could have a say among the fray in what may be his last ever F1 race. His qualifying session was eventful: he had to go back to the pits because McLaren had forgotten to fuel him. ‘Are you joking?’ he said. He still beat his rival for a seat at the team next year, Kevin Magnussen, who will start 11th. The slowest cars on the grid were the Caterhams of Kamui Kobayashi and British rookie Will Stevens. But just making it here was a triumph of sorts for the team, whose affairs are being overseen by an Irishman called Finbarr O’Connell, the administrator and a ballroom dance devotee, who now finds himself on the pit wall.","The F1 drivers' championship will be decided at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix .

"A newborn boy blinded by a hunter's stray bullet that shot through his living room window has returned home. Shayne Iverson from Clarksburg, Pennsylvania, spent more than two months at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and underwent numerous surgeries following the near-fatal incident. But on Wednesday, his mother Stefanie's 31st birthday, doctors gave him the all-clear. Recovery: Shayne Iverson, who was blinded by a hunter's stray bullet that shot through his living room window at six days old, has returned home in time for his first Christmas . His father, 42-year-old Jeremie Iverson, told the The Pittsburgh Tribune-Review that the infant is doing well. He and his wife haven't been able to work since the accident happened on September 25. They have also been fitting in hospital visits around caring for their other two children, nine-year-old son Caden and Gabi, aged two. Shayne was six days old when he was accidentally shot in the head by a deer hunter in late September. Around the clock care: The infant spent more than two months at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh and underwent numerous surgeries following the near-fatal incident . Touch and go: Doctors removed a blood clot to prevent his brain from swelling and battled to save his vision . At the time his father was cuddling him on the couch at home. It was around 7pm. After he was helicoptered to hospital, doctors removed a blood clot to prevent his brain from swelling and battled to save his vision with no joy. They said Shayne likely survived the shooting because the bullet that hit his head exited through his eye socket rather than hitting his brain. Although the two-month-old no longer requires around the clock care he will need to return to hospital for future surgeries. His father, who works as a carpenter, said their home is filled with medical equipment, medications and 'boxes and boxes of medical supplies.' The Iverson family have set up a GoFundMe page where they released a picture of baby Shayne with his big brother Caden, nine, and two-year-old sister Gabi when he was a day old . Mother Stefanie Iverson (pictured with her newborn son) said that her son Shayne's life was spared when the bullet exited through his eye socket . Jeremie Iverson and his wife Stefanie haven't been able to work since their son was accidentally shot . Indiana County District Attorney Pat Dougherty has said the hunter had an agricultural deer control permit. No charges have been filed, though investigators have continued to review whether game regulations or other laws were violated. The hunter was reportedly 300 yards from the home and using a 308 hunting rifle on private farm opposite the Iversons' home. Almost $18,000 dollars has  been donated by well-wishers towards the baby's medical costs after his aunt set up a GoFundMe page. In a heartfelt note to The Ellen DeGeneres Show announcing Shayne's return home this week, his great uncle, Jim Coughlin, thanked people for their generosity. He concluded: 'Although Shayne is no longer able to see with his eyes, he has reminded us that real sight comes from the heart.'","Shayne Iverson was just six days old when he was hit by a stray bullet while in his father's arms at his Pennsylvania home .

However, Aden initially told authorities that he had lost control of his vehicle and struck the teen because he thought he looked like a man who'd threatened him several days earlier. FBI spokeswoman Bridget Patton said: 'Federal agents are assisting in the investigation and have opened this matter as a federal civil rights investigation as a potential hate crimes violation.' Patton said she could not release any information on why the case could be considered a hate crime, but Muslim leaders had called for such an investigation early Friday. Scene: The crash unfolded outside the Somali Center, pictured, which the boy's father heads. Community members said that the driver had previously pulled a gun on people there for being Muslim . Death: Teenager Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein, who also called himself 'Adam' is seen here in Facebook photos . In the weeks before the crash, worshipers said they saw a black SUV painted with threatening messages at the center and cruising around a nearby shopping area. Mohamed Ahmed, 13, of Kansas City said: 'One of the messages was 'Islam Is Worse Than Ebola.' 'I would have thought the police would have taken care of it, but they didn't,' he said. But there was no mention of those incidents in court records and police didn't immediately comment on whether they're connected to the teen's death. Prayer: Men gather to pray the day after 15-year-old Abdisamad Sheikh-Hussein was struck and killed by a hit-and-run driver in front of the Somali Center of Kansas City, Mo., Friday, Dec. 5, 2014 . Mohamed Farah, 50, a  friend of the boy's family, said he called police more than once in October about a suspicious man who was coming around the center. 'I feel like I lost a part of my body,' he said after the teen's death. Bakar Abdalla, 31, of Kansas City, said the boy's father was a teacher at the center. He said the man who had been frequenting the area with hateful messages was like a bullet in a gun waiting to be triggered. Khadra Dirir, the victim's aunt, said her nephew regularly studied the Quran and had delivered a group prayer the night he died. 'If you asked him a verse, he could tell the chapter,' she said. 'I feel like I woke up in a bad dream.'","Ahmed H. Aden, 34, of Kansas City, was charged Friday in Jackson County .

"The official portrait of former California Govenor Arnold Schwarzenegger was hung Friday alongside past governors at the state Capitol after getting a touch-up on the spot where his wife's image was removed. Austrian artist Gottfried Helnwein smoothed out a smudge that once featured a lapel button showing the face of wife Maria Shriver, Capitol curator Koren Benoit said. That part had been noticeably painted over when the portrait was unveiled in September. Capitol Curator Koren Benoit, center, helps  Greg Scarlato, left, and Blake Robison of the Department of General Services, straighten the portrait of former Govenor  Arnold Schwarzenegger . The two separated after revelations emerged about an affair Schwarzenegger had with his maid that produced a son. It's not clear who removed the Shriver image in the first place. 'The original artist fixed it,' Benoit said. The painting of the two-term Republican governor was hung on the third floor of the Capitol next to his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. Schwarzenegger was elected governor in the same special election in 2003 in which Davis was recalled.

New addition: The picture now hangs on the third floor of the Capitol in Sacramento, California . The realist-style portrait features a steel frame and captures a youthful Schwarzenegger standing in front of the state seal. Benoit said there's some concern about people touching the portrait because of its photograph-like feel. Portraits are deliberately raised high on the wall because some have been damaged in the past with squirted ketchup or key scratches. Alison Parks, a tour guide with the state Department of Parks and Recreation, stopped with a group of children in front of the portrait minutes after it went up.

"Chelsea have announced Ron Gourlay is to leave his role as chief executive. The Scot, who joined the club in 2004 and worked as chief operating officer before succeeding Peter Kenyon as chief exec in 2009, departs on amicable terms to seek new opportunities. Marina Granovskaia, one of Roman Abramovich's advisers, is set for a bigger role behind the scenes at Chelsea. Here, Sportsmail tells you everything you need to know about the situation at Stamford Bridge. Marina Granovskia with Didier Drogba in 2010 and the Premier League trophy, FA Cup and Community Shield . Granovskaia (left) with Drogba (and his son Isaac), Salomon Kalou (second right) and Michael Emenalo . A smiling Granovskaia, Roman Abramovich's former PA who is set to hold much more power at Chelsea . GOURLAY’S GONE, WHAT’S NEXT? 'Chelsea Football Club announces that Ron Gourlay, after 10 successful years at the club including five as chief executive, is leaving Chelsea in order to pursue new business opportunities. 'The club, and in particular the owner (Roman Abramovich) and directors, wish to thank Ron for his many years of service to Chelsea and support his desire to seek new challenges. 'Ron's efforts have helped the club to achieve its position as one of the leading football clubs in the world. 'Pending additional appointments, chairman Bruce Buck and director Marina Granovskaia will assume additional executive responsibilities.' Marina Granovskaia. Keep hold of her coat-tails, she is the next big thing at Chelsea Football Club and is clearly going places after the announcement that Gourlay is on his way out. Gourlay was responsible for the day-to-day running of the club from Stamford Bridge. He was initially commercial director at Chelsea and filled Kenyon's shoes in 2009. Thankfully, we have never had to endure the type of press conference Kenyon squirmed through when Avram Grant was appointed Mourinho’s successor in September 2007. ‘He’s the right man for the job, we are absolutely convinced.’ Gourlay - or ‘Galloping’ as he was affectionately nicknamed by the media - negotiated Chelsea’s massive kit deal with Adidas, although as one industry insider said: ‘They pay, we wear, not difficult’. Gourlay was in the boardroom suite at Crystal Palace on Saturday and there was no hint the chief executive was about to quit Chelsea. Director of football Michael Emenalo was there, along with affable secretary Dave Barnard, chairman Bruce Buck and the up-and-coming figure of Granovskaia. She runs the show now. Ron Gourlay has worked at Chelsea for 10 years, including five as chief executive . HOW POWERFUL IS A CHELSEA CHIEF EXECUTIVE? The most powerful man at Chelsea is Roman Abramovich, period. Beyond that Eugene Tenenbaum, chairman Bruce Buck and the highly-influential Granovskaia jostle for position within Abramovich’s inner circle. To be fair to Gourlay he has overseen a period when Chelsea have become an acceptable face in European football and they are now respected by some of the biggest clubs on the continent. He is a decent, all-round nice guy. Gourlay was famously at the club's training ground on the day Jacob Mellis set off a smoke bomb. Mellis was later fired. Public speaking was never his thing and he gave an awkward interview with Buck to talkSPORT when John Terry had been banned for insulting Anton Ferdinand. Owner Abramovich, pictured celebrating against Arsenal, wields the most power at Chelsea . WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR CHELSEA IN THE SHORT-TERM? The accounts department at Chelsea might notice fewer receipts coming in from Lucio Italian restaurant on Fulham Road. It’s a regular haunt for the power-brokers at Stamford Bridge and takings won’t be down for long. Beyond that, Jose Mourinho will give a gushing tribute to Gourlay at his press conference on Friday and his departure will be recorded in the matchday programme for the fixture with QPR at Stamford Bridge on November 1. AND FURTHER DOWN THE LINE? The next chief executive will come under pressure to find a solution to Chelsea’s long-running problem over a new stadium. Rebuilding Stamford Bridge appears to be impossible and they have lost out on the regeneration project of Battersea Power Station. Gourlay (left) pictured with Chelsea chairman Bruce Buc, who will assume additional responsibilities . 'It has been a privilege to have played a role in the club's considerable achievements both on and off the pitch over the last 10 years, but I feel the time is right to move on to other challenges. 'I would like to thank Mr Abramovich, the directors, the manager and players and all the staff for their support during my time at the club, and wish them much continued success in the future.' They floated the idea of ground-sharing with the RFU at Twickenham for a season while they remodelled Stamford Bridge, but it was met with fierce opposition from local MP Vince Cable. Finding somewhere in the borough to build a new super-stadium - to compete with the biggest clubs in Europe in terms of attendances and matchday revenue - will become more acute over the next few years. WILL THIS AFFECT JOSE MOURINHO’S ROLE? Mourinho was used to being the main man in his first period in charge at Chelsea, but he accepted a different set of conditions and criteria when he returned to the club at the start of last season. He reports to the football club board now and they make the big decisions in terms of policy. Mourinho has his say, but his job is to coach the team and make transfer recommendations. The Chelsea chief executive pictured with former England manager Fabio Capello at Stamford Bridge . MARINA GRANOVSKIA WILL ASSUME 'ADDITIONAL EXECUTIVE RESPONSIBILITIES' - WHO IS SHE? Abramovich’s former PA. She has been close to a number of players in the past and has been on texting terms with them, which is not unusual for a modern-day executive. ANY WORD ON A LONG-TERM SUCCESSOR? Marina Granovskaia. Her time is now.","Ron Gourlay has been chief executive at Chelsea for the past five years .

"Environmentalists have hit out at a giant new solar farm in the Mojave Desert as mounting evidence reveals birds flying through the extremely hot 'thermal flux' surrounding the towers are being scorched. After years of regulatory . tangles around the impact on desert wildlife, the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating . System opened on Thursday but environmental groups say the nearly 350,000 gigantic mirrors are generating 1000 degree Fahrenheit temperatures which are killing and singeing birds. According to compliance documents released by developer BrightSource Energy last year, dozens of birds were found injured at the site during the building stage. State and federal regulators are currently conducting a two-year study of the Ivanpah plant's effects on birds, with environmental groups questioning the the value of cleaner power when native wildlife is being killed or injured. Scroll down for video . 'Tower-power': Heat emanating from the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the world's largest solar farm of its kind, has allegedly killed and injured dozens of birds and other wildlife in the Mojave desert . Injured wildlife: Environmentalists say there is growing evidence the technology is scorching birds that fly through the intense heat surrounding the towers, which can reach 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit . Big changes: The Mojave Desert has been transformed from a wilderness which homes tortoises and coyotes to a $2.2billion green energy complex with the power to produce nearly 400 megawatts . Bright future: Jeff Holland walks near some of 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors that reflect sunlight to boilers that sit on 459-foot towers at the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System . Shine on: The computer-controlled mirrors, all 300,000 of them, are used to heat water in the boilers' tubes and make steam, which in turn drives turbines to create electricity . Looking for some hot stuff: A boiler at The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System on the California-Nevada border vents steam as the field is set to finally open today after years of regulatory and legal tangles . Ivanpah, a joint project uniting NRG Energy Inc., Google Inc. and BrightSource Energy, can produce enough electricity to power 140,000 homes. Larger projects are on the way, but for now, Ivanpah is being described as a marker for the United States' emerging solar industry. While solar power accounts for less than one per cent of the nation's power output, thousands of projects from large, utility-scale plants to small production sites are under construction or being planned, particularly across the sun-drenched Southwest. 'The opening of Ivanpah is a dawn of a new era in power generation in the United States,' said Rhone Resch, president of the Solar Energy Industries Association, a trade group. 'We are going to be a global leader in solar generation.' The plant's dedication comes as government continues to push for development of greener, cleaner power. President Barack Obama has mounted a second-term drive to combat climate change, proposing first-ever limits on carbon pollution from new and existing power plants. His plan aims to help move the U.S. from a coal-dependent past into a future fired by wind and solar power, nuclear energy and natural gas. According to U.S. Energy Information Administration data, the cost of building and operating a new solar thermal power plant over its lifetime is greater than generating natural gas, coal or nuclear power. It costs a conventional coal plant $100, on average, to produce a megawatt-hour of power, but that figure is $261 for solar thermal power, according to 2011 estimates. The figures do not account for incentives such as state or federal tax credits that can impact the cost. Ken Johnson, a spokesman for the solar association, said in a statement that solar systems have seen 'dramatic price declines' in the last few years. That's good for utilities in California, which must obtain a third of their electricity from solar and other renewable sources by 2020. Supervising power: Jeff Holland, left, talks with Noel Hanson as they look out over a part of the five-square-mile field of gigantic mirrors set to produce enough electricity to power 140,000 homes . Shining beacon: While solar power accounts for less than one per cent of the nation's power output, thousands of projects from large, utility-scale plants to small production sites are under construction or being planned, particularly across the sun-drenched Southwest . Nice view: One of the three boiler towers with uses the reflections from the mirrors to heat water and create steam which powers the turbines to create electricity . The Ivanpah site, about 45 miles southwest of Las Vegas, has virtually unbroken sunshine most of the year and is near transmission lines that carry power to consumers. Using technology known as solar-thermal, more than 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors roughly the size of a garage door reflect sunlight to boilers atop 459-foot towers. The sun's power is used to heat water in the boilers' tubes and make steam, which drives turbines to create electricity. While many people are familiar with rooftop solar, or photovoltaic panels, 'these are a little bit different. This takes the sun's rays and reflects them onto towers,' said NRG spokesman Jeff Holland. The plant can be a startling sight for drivers heading toward Las Vegas along busy Interstate 15. Amid miles of rock and scrub, its vast array of 7-by-10-foot mirrors creates the image of an ethereal lake shimmering atop the desert floor. In fact, it's built on a dry lakebed. Google announced in 2011 that it would invest $168million in the project. As part of its financing, BrightSource also lined up $1.6billion in loans guaranteed by the U.S. Energy Department. Ivanpah can be seen as a success story and a cautionary tale, highlighting the inevitable trade-offs between the need for cleaner power and the loss of fragile, open land. The California Energy Commission concluded that while the solar plant would impose 'significant impacts on the environment ... the benefits the project would provide override those impacts.' Uniting powers: The gigantic green energy project is a joint mission between  NRG Energy Inc., Google Inc. and BrightSource Energy . Looking at the man in the mirror: Noel Hanson stands near some of 300,000 computer-controlled mirrors on The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System . All under control: Workers monitor more than 300,000 mirrors from The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System's high tech control room . Field of (green) dreams: The field of mirrors sprawls over five square miles of the Mojave Desert on the border of Nevada and California, about 45miles southwest of Las Vegas . Such disputes are likely to continue for years as more companies seek to develop solar, wind and geothermal plants on land treasured by environmentalists who also support the growth of renewable energy. At issue is what is worth preserving and at what cost, as California pushes to generate more electricity from renewable sources. In 2012, the federal government established 17 'solar energy zones' in an attempt to direct development to land it has identified as having fewer wildlife and natural-resource obstacles. The zones comprise about 450 square miles in six states — California, Nevada, Arizona, Utah, Colorado and New Mexico. The Western Watershed Project is continuing to push a lawsuit against federal agencies that reviewed the Ivanpah project. Its California director, Michael J. Connor, said alternatives to the site were not considered and serious environmental impacts, including fragmenting the tortoise population, were ignored. 'Do we really need to have these giant plants first, or is it better to generate solar power on people's roofs, the place it's going to be used?' Connor asked. NRG did not respond to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Resch said a key issue for the industry will be maintaining government policies that encourage development, including tax credits for solar projects that are set to expire in 2016 and government loan guarantees. 'The direct result of these policies is projects like Ivanpah,' he said. According to statistics compiled by the Energy Department, the solar industry employs more than 140,000 Americans at about 6,100 companies, with employment increasing nearly 20 percent since the fall of 2012.","The Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System, the world's largest solar plant of its kind, recently switched on .

"It is one of the key bonding experiences for a mother and child: breastfeeding. So lesbian partners Heidi and Maryellen Olson wanted to share that with their first-born Sequoia. They both nurse their one-month-old daughter. Phenomenon: Maryellen Olson, 25, nurses her daughter Sequoia despite not giving birth . Both breastfeeding: Her wife Heidi, 26, naturally lactates meaning they can both nurse their first-born . Dubbed 'co-nursing', the little-known practice requires Maryellen, who didn't give birth, to induce lactation and take a natural drug to boost breastmilk. According to the new parents, it has changed everything. 'It is so worth it for the closeness I feel with Sequoia, and also for the sanity-saving it provides both of us,' graduate student Maryellen, 25, told MailOnline from the family's home in Santa Cruz, California. 'We both feel pretty amazed. 'It's amazing to see what our bodies can do, and we felt lucky to have this additional bonding experience available for both of us.' The couple, who married in 2012, discovered the treatment - more common among adoptive families - in a group for lesbians trying to conceive and immediately agreed to pursue it. Maryellen followed a program named the Newman-Goldfarb protocol, which made her body simulate pregnancy. Starting four months before the birth, she took birth control pills and a breastmilk-enhancing drug called Domperidone. The drug does not yet have FDA approval but is prevalent in Europe, some US states, and Canada, where Heidi and Maryellen eventually bought their dosage. Experience: The couple from Santa Cruz, California, said it has made them stronger as a family . Journey: Maryellen (right) started taking birth control pills and a drug called Domperidone four months before Heidi (left) gave birth to Sequoia on November 7. They conceived using artificially inseminated donor sperm . Maryellen stopped the birth control pills six weeks before Heidi's due date, to make her body believe she had given birth, and started 'pumping' up to six times a day. The pump is designed to make a woman's body produce more milk. By the time Sequoia was born on November 7, Maryellen was ready to nurse. She will continue with Domperidone and herbal tablets called 'More Milk Special Blend' until Sequioa is no longer breastfeeding. 'Our friends are fascinated by the fact that my wife and I both breastfeed our daughter,' Heidi, a 26-year-old nurse, said. 'We get a lot of: ""Wow, that's amazing!"" and ""I didn't know that was possible!""' It came after a long battle to conceive. Heidi endured a year-long battle with endometriosis and ovarian cysts that threatened to affect her fertility. In spring this year, she was finally able to undergo an intrauterine insemination (IUI) to implant a donor's sperm in her uterus. But it took ten cycles before the pregnancy test flashed pink. 'It was a heart wrenching time and very hard on us both,' Heidi said. 'Every cycle and negative test was harder than the last, and the doctors were less and less hopeful. Birth: Having followed the meticulous program, Maryellen was able to nurse Sequoia as soon as she was born . Joy: They celebrated the birth at their family home and say they are already easing into their nursing routine . 'Our positive pregnancy test came just in the nick of time, and we were so glad.' Now, four weeks after their home birth, photographed by Santa Cruz Birth Photography, Heidi, Maryellen and Sequoia are easing into their unconventional routine. For Sequoia, it means she doesn't have to wait around - even though she is sometimes stubborn ('she really makes us work for it!'). 'We don't really have a set schedule or rotation,' Maryellen said. 'Whoever is near the baby or holding her will feed her, and the other will try to pump then or shortly after.' 'We are able to sleep in longer chunks due to this, since it's not all on one mama to have to feed her and stay awake. We switch whenever the awake mama feels like she needs help or sleep.' Makes everything easier! Both nursing, it means either can respond to Sequoia's cries if the other is busy . But the crucial benefit is their connection. Maryellen said: 'For me, I am able to feel even closer to her. 'I am absolutely in love with her and feel incredibly connected to her ever since she was in utero, but since she's been out of the womb and I'm breastfeeding, I feel even more connected. 'I know other non-carrying lesbian mothers who feel like they are not as close to their child as the mom who carried the baby, and I know that breastfeeding has helped me feel incredibly bonded to her. 'When she is breastfeeding and falls asleep on me or lays her hand on me, I feel an overwhelming amount of love for her that I wouldn't have were I not breastfeeding.'","Heidi and Maryellen Olson conceived first daughter using donor sperm .
Heidi gave birth to Sequoia on Nov 7, Maryellen wanted to breastfeed too .

"The England bid team for the 2018 World Cup should come clean if they attempted any vote swaps, a former chairman of the Football Association has said. Lord Triesman, who was also chairman of the 2018 bid until 2010, said England should not advocate greater transparency from other countries than it was prepared to apply to itself. His comments came as he launched a renewed attack on the world governing body FIFA during a House of Lords debate on sports governance. Lord Triesman (left) pictured alongside Prince William at the FA Cup final between Chelsea and Portsmouth . In the latest in a string of allegations about the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups, won by Russia and Qatar respectively, both countries, along with England have been accused of breaking FIFA rules. A dossier compiled by the Sunday Times and published at the weekend by the Culture, Media and Sport select committee accused Russia and Qatar of engaging in vote-trading and vote-buying while England's 2018 bid are alleged to have engineered a failed vote-swap with their counterparts in the South Korea 2022 bid. All three organisations have always denied any wrongdoing in their bids to host the tournaments, and a report recently by Hans-Joachim Eckert, the chairman of the adjudicatory chamber of FIFA's ethics committee, cleared Russia and Qatar to stage the tournaments. The Sunday Times claims the allegations it submitted to Parliament were contained within a database which it says was compiled by England's 2018 bidding team. The chairman of the Culture, Media and Sport select committee, John Whittingdale, admitted none of the allegations in the Sunday Times dossier had been proven but said they gave the impression of FIFA being a 'deeply corrupt organisation'. After setting out the recent attempts by FIFA to investigate corruption claims, Lord Triesman said: 'It would all beggar belief, but not quite enough disbelief in a way. Triesman (left) pictured alongside FIFA president Sepp Blatter (right) in Zurich, Switzerland . 'The England 2018 bid team apparently also have a secret dossier with potential evidence of corruption. 'When asked by Mr Justice Dingemans and also I think by the select committee, they said they had no further information. 'I would love to have seen it. It would have gone immediately to Mr John Whittingdale and his committee and they would have been the people to judge whether it was appropriate to move further and not those who really didn't want it to be seen. 'FIFA needs root and branch reform. Its culture will not be changed by tweaking the processes. Culture is always stronger than process. Mr (Sepp) Blatter (FIFA president) and the old school must go. His intention to run again is bad for sport. 'The Swiss government should be involved, the major sponsors should be involved and I believe the bids for the World Cup in 2018 and 2022 should be re-run. 'If England has anything to say about vote swapping that is not to its credit then let's come clean as well and not advocate for others what we are not prepared to do for ourselves.' Triesman (right) seen alongside former England manager Fabio Capello (right) at Wembley Stadium . Setting out the recent situation at FIFA, Lord Triesman, a Labour peer, said: 'Systematic corruption over decades overseen by a group who have been there for decades; World Cups awarded by committee nearly half of whom have been compelled to go and some of whom jumped before that point. 'Whistle blowers and investigative journalists disregarded; no embarrassment quite enough to prompt any action. 'A senior United States lawyer appointed to investigate but not to see the people who had already been exposed as corrupt, nor to view the huge Sunday Times documentation. 'Mr (Michael) Garcia writes a long report that isn't to be published. A German lawyer employed by FIFA writes a summary. Mr Garcia denounces it four hours later as inaccurate and defective. Still no one wants to publish the actual document. 'Candidly, I was surprised to be criticised for not helping Mr Garcia although I was subject to a sub judice restriction because I was being sued by a member of the FIFA executive for suggesting there might be corruption in that organisation.' Triesman added his voice to calls for Michael Garcia's (left) report into FIFA ethics to be fully published . Garcia's report has only been published as a summary by FIFA, something Garcia himself quickly denounced . Opening the debate, Lord Moynihan, a former chairman of the British Olympic Association and sports minister, called for a wide-ranging overhaul of British sports governance. The Tory peer has put forward a backbench Bill on the issue that would bring in a string of measures aimed at improving the situation. 'The need for good governance in sport is no less or more than the requirement for FTSE companies and is essential if we are to protect the interests of athletes in the future,' he said. 'Only by demonstrating good governance in sport, can governance and British sports administrators use their influence internationally to good effect.'","Lord Triesman chaired England's bid to host the 2018 World Cup until 2010 .

"Luis Suarez's first appearance for Uruguay since sinking his teeth into the shoulder of Italy's Giorgio Chiellini saw the Barcelona forward produce a beautifully-controlled volley that created the opening goal - and leave the pitch to visit the toilet during the game. The 27-year-old was named in the starting XI for the friendly fixture after his ban for four months and nine international matches was restricted to 'official matches only' by the Court of Arbitration for Sport on appeal. And Uruguay's No 9 set about proving why he should be given another chance by striking a right-footed volley that hit the post and forced an own goal from Hassan Muath Fallatah, before Saudi Arabia substitute Naif Hazazi equalised in the dying minutes.

After the match, he said: 'Happy to wear this shirt again which gives me so much joy. You never lose your love for the shirt. Uruguay!' It took until the second half for Suarez to muster the chance for Uruguay in Jeddah, but it was single-handedly created by the controversial £75million striker. Suarez won the initial free-kick after a rash challenge by Omar Hawsawi near the half-way line before peeling away from defenders to meet the resulting cross. He hit the left post as  goalkeeper Abdullah Faisal Alarraf remained rooted, and defender Fallatah could do little to prevent the ball ricocheting off him into the back of his own net. Suarez could and should have doubled Uruguay's lead in the 66th minute, too. Latching on to a poor back pass, he found himself one-on-one with Abdullah, but the Saudi Arabia goalkeeper did well to get a palm to the ball as Suarez sluggishly tried to go  around.

"A £15 million British military base will be established in Bahrain marking Britain's clear commitment to a 'sustained presence east of Suez', the Foreign Secretary has said. Philip Hammond told a security summit that bolstering the Royal Navy's presence in the Gulf would allow the UK and its allies in the region to 'tackle the threats we face together'. Britain already has four minehunters permanently based at the Mina Salman Port, but the plans will allow for an increase in the number and size of warships sent to the area. Scroll down for video . £15million development: Britain is to establish a new military base in Bahrain in a Gulf security deal . Under the deal – described by Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton as 'symbolic and strategically important' – the port will be expanded and a forward operating base established, with Bahrain paying most of the costs. Although military chiefs are understood to have been working towards the move for around two years, the threat from Islamic State has heightened the focus on Britain's presence in the region. 'To our partners in the Gulf my message is this: Your security concerns are our security concerns,' Mr Hammond said in a speech in Manama, Bahrain. 'So our strategic priority for the Gulf and for the wider region is to build partnerships. Partnerships for security; partnerships for prosperity; partnerships for stability.' He added: 'The expansion of our footprint that this arrangement will now allow means we will have the capability to send more and bigger ships, and to sustain them and their crews in permanent facilities. Philip Hammond said the new base would accommodate ships including Type 45 destroyers, such as the HMS Dauntless, above . 'A clear statement of our commitment to our sustained presence east of Suez. 'A reminder of our historic and close relationship with Bahrain and one example of our growing partnership with Gulf allies to tackle the threats we face together. 'And those threats have taken on a new and insidious form: in Benghazi and in Mosul, in Yemen and in Northern Nigeria, we face a common but shadowy enemy: extremists who seek to hijack Islam to impose their own perverted agenda by fear and by the sword; who reject all norms of civilised behaviour; who challenge all structures of established order.' The move was described as 'symbolic' by Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Houghton and reverses a 1960s' decision to withdraw British forces stationed 'east of Suez'. Under the deal, existing facilities at the port will be expanded and a forward operating base established, with Bahrain paying most of the £15 million infrastructure costs. Defence Secretary Michael Fallon said: 'This will enable Britain to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability in the Gulf.' Britain already has four minehunters naval ships permanently based at the Mina Salman Port, above . Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond (left) said the plans would help 'tackle the threats we face together' while Defence Secretary Michael Fallon (right) said more ships will be sent to the Gulf . 'This new base is a permanent expansion of the Royal Navy's footprint and will enable Britain to send more and larger ships to reinforce stability. We will now be based again in the Gulf for the long term.' Mr Hammond signed the deal with Bahrain's foreign minister Sheikh Khalid bin Ahmed bin Mohammed Al-Khalifa. Sheikh Khalid said: 'It reaffirms our joint determination to maintain regional security and stability in the face of challenging circumstances, and gives further strength to our multifaceted partnership. 'Bahrain looks forward to the early implementation of today's arrangement and to continuing to work with the UK and other partners to address threats to regional security.' A string of human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch, have criticised the state's human rights record, and anti-arms campaigners protested outside a This is Bahrain conference in Westminster earlier this year, demanding the Government and royal family sever all ties with the regime. General Houghton told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: 'It's the strategic importance of this. Rather than just being seen as a temporary deployment to an area for a specific operational purpose, this is more symbolic of the fact that Britain does enjoy interests in the stability of this region. The £15million expansion of Mina Salman Port means more ships and larger ships will be sent to the Gulf. Above, the HMS Duncan arriving in Cardiff earlier this year . 'And the fact that the Bahraini authorities and government agreed to fund infrastructure within the country to base our maritime capability forward, both is a recognition from their perspective of the quality of the relationship with the United Kingdom, but also of our interest over time in maintaining the stability of this very important area.' Shadow Defence Secretary Vernon Coaker said: 'Labour supports the Royal Navy having a strong international footprint with the ability to respond quickly to events in a uncertain global environment. 'British defence policy must be strategically-led. The Strategic Defence and Security Review and a National Security Strategy are due to take place next year, and it was expected long term issues like this would be assessed and decided then. 'The Government should therefore clearly set out its reasons for making this particular decision at this time.'","Philip Hammond told security summit of plans to bolster presence in Gulf .

"A retired investment banker who took his own life at his Kensington mansion had become ‘very anxious’ about authorities investigating his former employer, an inquest has heard. William ‘Bill’ Broeksmit, 58, who was a former executive at Deutsche Bank, killed himself in January after leaving several suicide notes for family and friends. The inquest at London's High Court heard how Mr Broeksmit retired from his position at the bank in February last year. William 'Bill' Broeksmit, 58, was found hanged at his home in South Kensington, central London, left, on January 26, by his wife Alla, far right, who is pictured with Stella Hayes at a book launch party in 2008 . Written medical evidence said he was ‘very anxious’ last summer about authorities investigating areas of banking where he had worked, but did not give any further details. The former senior manager, who had close ties to the bank's co-Chief Executive Anshu Jain, was found dead at his South Kensington home by his wife, Alla, on January 26. None of his family was present for the inquest but his lawyer handed a note from his wife to reporters afterwards which said: ‘Bill was a loving husband and devoted father. The children and I are heartbroken by our loss.’ The inquest was told how he had not appeared anxious or depressed when he last saw a doctor in December 2013. Psychologist William Mitchell said Mr Broeksmit recognised his concerns were due to a state of anxiety rather than reality. Coroner Fiona Wilcox said there was ‘clear suicidal intent’ in the notes he left but did not give details of their content. Mr Broeksmit worked in investment banking and lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, pictured, which has an average property value of £1.9million . She said: ‘These notes do provide evidence of intention. I am therefore satisfied … that William Broeksmit did take his own life.’ Mr Broeksmit worked in investment banking - specifically risk and securities - and lived on exclusive Evelyn Gardens in South Kensington, which has an average property value of £1.9million. He was also registered to a high-value property a stone's throw from New York's Central Park. Mr Broeksmit's name appears on US government records for the Broeksmit Family Foundation, which is based in the palatial 1185 Park Avenue building. Mr Broeksmit is linked by US documents to a three-bedroom apartment in this building, yards from Central Park in New York . The three-bedroom, three-bathroom apartment to which he is linked was worth around £2million when it was last sold in June 2000. Mr Broeksmit, who was born in the United States, was a key founder of Deutsche's investment bank and one of many bankers, including Mr Jain, who joined Germany's flagship lender from Merrill Lynch in the 1990s when Deutsche launched plans to compete on Wall Street. He was involved in the process of rescuing the bank in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, when many investment banks found their debts were 'toxic', and unlikely ever to be repaid. Co-chairmen of Deutsche Bank, Juergen Fitschen (left) and Anshu Jain (right) called Mr Broeksmit 'a dear friend and colleague to many of us who benefited from his intellect and wisdom' William Broeksmit worked at Deutsche Bank from 1996 to 2001, then from 2008 until he retired (file picture) Mr Broeksmit, a renowned risk expert, assisted the bank's efforts to shift the worst of the debt, and reduce its total amount of lending. Chiefs at Deutsche Bank had planned to promote Mr Broeksmit to its management board in 2012, but stopped when the German financial regulator expressed doubts about his experience as a leader. Deutsche Bank said in a statement after yesterday’s inquest: ‘Bill was not under suspicion of wrongdoing in any matter.’ Sorry we are not currently accepting comments on this article.","William Broeksmit was found dead at South Kensington home in January .

"Japan has given the Scotch whisky industry a ‘wake up call’ - after a single malt from the Far East was named the best in the world. Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013 has been given the title by Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible - which describes the drink as a work of ‘near incredible genius’. For the first time, the 2015 edition of the renowned publication features no Scottish distillery in its top five. Scroll down for video . Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013 has been given the title by Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible - which describes the drink as a work of ‘near incredible genius’ And to rub salt in Scotland’s wounds, the auld enemy has won European Whisky of the Year - the honour going to Chapter 14 Not Peated, from the English Whisky Company. The Yamazaki Single Malt, from Japan’s oldest distillery which dates back to 1923, was given 97.5 marks out of 100 by Murray - who hailed its ‘nose of exquisite boldness’ and finish of ‘light, teasing spice’. Varieties of Scotch whisky has been named best in the world by Murray in two of the last three years - Old Pulteney’s 21 year-old single malt in 2012 and Glenmorangie Ealanta in 2014. Varieties of Scotch whisky has been named best in the world by Murray in two of the last three years - Old Pulteney’s 21 year-old single malt in 2012 and Glenmorangie Ealanta in 2014. But the expert says that the emergence of such high quality overseas tipples should be a ‘wake up call’ for the Scottish industry. He accused producers of taking their ‘eye off the ball’ adding that the Yamazaki drink is ‘a single malt which no Scotch can at the moment get anywhere near’. Robert Burns (left) loved his whisky and even has a single malt named after him (right) Murray said he had sampled hundreds of Scotch whiskies while tasting 4,700 varieties from around the world for his 2015 bible. In a savage critique of the Scottish industry - whose quality was written into folklore by the likes of Robbie Burns, he complains: ‘Where were the complex whiskies in the prime of their lives?’ Scottish bard Burns’s 1785 poem Scotch Drink celebrates whisky as ‘thy strong heart’s blood’ and ‘guid auld’ drink. But Murray bemoans the lack of innovation in the present-day industry. He writes: ‘Where were the blends which offered bewildering layers of depth? ‘Where were the malts which took you on hair-standing journeys through dank and dingy warehouses? ‘Some have taken their eye off the ball and not brought into account the changes which have altered the face of whisky. ‘They began to believe their own PR hype and standard brands started standing still or going backwards.’ The winning Yamazaki whisky - of which only 18,000 bottles were made - is only sold in a few hundred specialist shops in the UK and retails for £100.","Yamazaki Single Malt Sherry Cask 2013 given title by Jim Murray’s Whisky Bible .

The attack is a rare strike in Punjab, Pakistan's richest and most populous province. The area, which is also the power-base of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, has been spared the worst of the bloody wave of Islamist violence that has assailed the country in recent years. Mushtaq Sukhera, the Punjab provincial police chief, said: 'It appears to have been a suicide attack. At least 55 people have been killed and more than 120 wounded. Women and children were also killed.' Lahore police chief Amin Wains confirmed it was a suicide attack. It appears the blast took place some distance from the famous crossing point itself. 'People were returning after watching the parade at Wagah border when the blast took place. Ball bearings were found at the scene,' he said.

Mushtaq Sukhera, the Punjab police chief, said the blast happened when a suicide attacker approached a restaurant after the Wagah ceremony and detonated his explosives. He said the attacker had struck when security had been 'a bit relaxed'. There are several security checkpoints on the road leading to the border post, which is equipped with a ceremonial gate and banked seating. Before entering, spectators are security checked, though searches are not always particularly rigorous. Dozens of people use the Wagah crossing to enter India and Pakistan every day as it is the only road crossing between the two countries. It is also a crucial trade facility, where truck-loads of goods coming from and going to India are loaded and unloaded.

Tonight, Pakistani opposition politician Imran Khan condemned the blast as an 'act of terror'. 'Shocked and saddened by suicide attack near Wagah border,' the former international cricketer tweeted. Meanwhile Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi condemned the attack as a 'dastardly act of terrorism'. India has in the past accused Pakistan of sponsoring jihadi groups in the region. The two countries, which have fought three wars against each other, have been engaged in a long-running conflict over the region of Kashmir, which both sides claim. An Indian security official said the Indian side of the border was not affected by the explosion. Devastated relatives stand beside the victims of the attack, which various umbrella groups of the Tehreek-e-Taliban group have claimed credit for . In recent weeks, the homegrown Pakistani Taliban group has become fragmented and the differing factions have all laid claim to the suicide bomb attack which has killed at least 55 people . Pakistan has been wracked by a homegrown Taliban insurgency, the Tehreek-e-Taliban (TTP) movement that has killed thousands of people in recent years. In recent weeks the movement has become fragmented, which has meant several conflicting claims of responsibility for the attack. Abdullah Bahar, a spokesman for a TTP faction loyal to its dead chief Hakimullah Mehsud, said they carried it out to avenge Mehsud's killing in a US drone strike last year. But the Jamat-ul-Ahrar faction, which broke away from the main TTP leadership in September, rubbished the claim and said they were behind the blast. Group spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan said in an email statement the attack was revenge for those killed in the ongoing military operation in North Waziristan tribal area, on the Afghan border. Ehsan said they would soon release video footage of the attack. TV channels also ran claims from a third militant faction, called Jundullah. Pakistani paramilitary soldiers stand guard at the road leading to the scene of the attack in Lahore . Attacks by the homegrown Taliban insurgency were once a near-daily occurrence but have tailed off since the army launched its anti-militant offensive in the north-west. In June the army began the long-awaited operation against militant hideouts in North Waziristan after a bloody raid on Karachi Airport ended faltering peace talks between the government and the Taliban. More than 1,100 militants and 100 soldiers have been killed since the start of the operation, and more than 100 militants have surrendered, according to the military.","At least 55 people killed and 120 wounded during ceremony at sunset .

"A popular restaurant has made the controversial decision to add a section to its credit card receipts that gives diners the option to leave a second tip for kitchen staff. Zach Pollack, owner/chef at Alimento, a popular Italian eatery in Los Angeles, said he added the second gratuity after two of his cooks left for higher paying jobs. 'They couldn't make it work on their end, and I couldn't make it work on mine - this is a small restaurant,' he told Los Angeles Magazine. 'But at the same time, the servers are walking away with a lot of money. That's great, but it put an issue in the spotlight that I've been aware of for a while.' Would you leave a second tip? Alimento, an Italian restaurant in Los Angeles, has added a second line on its credit card receipts in hopes of retaining its kitchen staff . The kitchen gratuity will be divided evenly between Alimento's line cooks, prep cooks and dishwashers. The sous chefs and Pollack himself will not get a cut. Traditionally, kitchen staff make a higher hourly wage than front-of-house staff - like bartenders and waitresses - to compensate for the fact they aren't making tips. Still, the take-home pay doesn't even out: According to a study cited by Grubstreet, back-of-house workers make an average of $18,720 per year while the people in front make $24,123. Mr Pollack says he hopes other eateries adopt his policy so that ultimately 'the best restaurants would be able to sustain better cooks, rather than losing them to hotels, country clubs, or lounge restaurants that are able to subsidize kitchen labor with extra income.' Ready for dinner! Alimento is located in Los Angeles's trendy Silver Lake neighborhood . Restaurant employees are divided about Pollack's plan. Oliver Levius, a chef at Italian restaurant Pastai in Manhattan, told MailOnline he thinks the kitchen gratuity is 'a little tacky' and 'overly forward.' 'It also pits the servers against the kitchen team, and restaurants tend to work better if the whole joint is pulling together,' he said. Pastai's manager Charles Fenwick Elliott, who is a former waiter, offered another scenario: 'I've had bad tips before as a direct result of the kitchen screwing up. Conversely, great food can go unrewarded if the service is bad. So in my utopic restaurant scenario, I'd like to see tips split down the middle between servers and kitchen staff.' Bob Wilkerson, who worked as a cook in high-end restaurants in Roanoke, Virginia, for more than 15 years, said Pollack's plan is something he always wished for. 'There was nothing worse than working a 500 plate service and then hearing the servers brag about the money that they had made,' Mr Wilkerson said. 'Working a Friday night dinner rush is probably one of the most stressful things I have ever done. Having a few bucks tossed my way at the end of a shift like that would certainly make my day. 'Kitchen workers are the unsung heroes of the food industry, and they can make or break a restaurant's reputation. I don't think there needs to be an industry standard for what to tip the kitchen, but what is it to throw an extra dollar to the cooks? Those dollars would add up.' Although the industry may be divided, none of the potential patrons the Mail interviewed seemed perturbed by the suggestion to leave a second tip for kitchen staff. 'When a meal is really great, why would I not want to reward the kitchen?' said Amelia Mattix, a resident of Brooklyn, New York.. 'I'm in law school, so it's not like I'm exactly rolling in dough at the moment, but a few extra dollars for an awesome meal isn't going to keep me from paying rent.' Chicago resident Jourdan Crouch agrees: 'If the restaurant is tiny - which it sounds like this place is - the owner probably can't afford to raise the hourly wage by much. If this is what I can do to support small businesses that I love, I'm happy to do it. Plus, having a second tip section gives you the option to distinguish great food from great service. I won't punish the server for bad food, and I won't punish the kitchen for bad service.' Mr Pollack insists that the kitchen tip is completely optional - and he's reminding Alimento's diners of this by sending a tiny card out with the bill. 'At Alimento, we believe a great meal comes together not from the effort of any single person, but from the successful cooperation of a team of people, from servers and hosts, to cooks and bussers. Nevertheless, traditional tipping has created a very sizeable gap between the earnings of cooks and servers, and current State law prohibits restaurants from sharing servers' tips with kitchen staff. Rather than imposing a mandatory 'service fee' or 'kitchen surcharge' as many are doing, we'd like to leave the choice in your, the diner's, hands. If you're perfectly happy with tipping as usual, there's no need for you to do anything differently. But, if you'd like to send a little love to the lads and ladies hustling in the back, we'd be honored to provide you the means to do so. All such tips will go to line cooks and other kitchen staff; no one in management will participate.L.A. has many great restaurants, and we're thrilled you've chosen to dine with us today. We will continue to work hard to bring you the best dining experience we possibly can.Thanks for your ongoing support!' This is not the first restaurant that has experimented with a different model for paying its employees. Los Angeles restaurants Republique, Animal, Hungry Cat and others have added a 3per cent surcharge to bills to pay for employees' health insurance, according to the LA Times. And Michelin-star chef Daniel Patterson, who owns Coi in San Francisco, recently announced plans to do away with tips and service charges altogether at his new restaurant Aster. Instead, he will raise menu prices by 15per cent and pay all employees hourly. 'This way, price is all inclusive,' he told Eater. 'There's no healthy San Francisco surcharge. There's no tip, there's no service charge. There's just one price. 'I really do think in five years that's how every restaurant will run.'","L.A restaurant Alimento implemented the idea in an effort to keep talent from leaving for higher paying jobs .

"A film about homosexual wartime codebreaker and father of modern computing Alan Turing has been attacked by his biographer. Enigma hero Turing played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during the Second World War while working at Bletchley Park. He is credited with saving thousands of lives during the conflict. But a new American funded film about his life has been lambasted for exaggerating a love affair with a woman, played by Keira Knightley, and making a fictional connection to a notorious spy. Turing was a well known homosexual. Enigma hero Turing (left) played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during the Second World War while working at Bletchley Park. Benedict Cumberbatch (right) is set to play him in an American funded film . The Imitation Game is based on a biography by Andrew Hodges, an Oxford maths academic. It is set to star Benedict Cumberbatch as Turing and fellow Bletchley codebreaker Joan Clarke will be played by Keira Knightley as Turing's girlfriend - despite the fact that he was gay. The Sunday Times reports that Mr Hodges has been sent a script of the film and is 'alarmed by the inaccuracies it'. He said: 'They have built up the relationship with Joan much more than it actually was.' He said while the couple had been 'briefly engaged', it was said that he liked her because he could talk to her as if she were really another man' and there had never been much physical contact. He said the casting of Keira Knightley in the role, did not 'strike him as right.' Fellow Bletchley codebreaker Joan Clarke (left) is set to be played by Keira Knightley (right) as Turing's girlfriend - despite . the fact that he was gay . He said: 'I'm not being rude about her, but Joan Clarke was no glamourpuss.' The film follows the break-up of their relationship, which happened because Turing was unable to live a lie by marrying her. But Hodges is said to be more concerned about the main story line, which invents a fictional relationship between Turing and John Cairncross, who was later identified as the fifth man in the British spy ring that included Kim Philby and Guy Burgess. People who worked on separate projects at Bletchley were kept apart and Hodges labeled the scenario 'ludicrous'  adding that Turing and Cairncross would never have met. He said: 'Their relationship is invented.' The paper reports that a line in the script, which sees Turing confronted by a colleague who tells him 'No wonder they think you are a spy', has now been removed. The film was written by Graham Moore and is to be directed by the Norwegian Morten Tyldum whose last production was the violent thriller Headhunters, and produced by Teddy Schwarzmann. Enigma hero Turing played a key role in breaking the German Enigma code during the Second World War while working at Bletchley Park (pictured). He is credited with saving thousands of lives during the conflict .

"Dangerous: 19-year-old Breona Synclair Watkins was arrested early Tuesday after officers found her driving with her 5-month-old baby in the trunk of the car . A young mother was arrested early Tuesday after she put her 5-month-old baby into the trunk of her car, to avoid getting a ticket for not driving with a car seat. Broward County, Florida sheriff's deputies first spotted 19-year-old Breona Synclair Watkins driving a car with a headlight out around 1am, when she pulled out 15 feet into an intersection at a red light, and then backed up. They then attempted to pull her over, but she continued through the green light and another quarter-mile before coming to a stop. The 14-year-old sitting in the passenger seat said the 2005 Dodge Stratis belong to her mother. When another deputy showed up and heard crying from the trunk, so they opened it up and found  Watkins' 5-month-old laying on a pair of large hedge-cutting shears. The temperature in the trunk was noticeably warmer than outside, and was littered with other hazardous materials like a rusty metal hanger and tire iron, a plastic CD case and a used gas can. Watkins told police officers that the 14-year-old was holding the baby in her lap when she noticed the cops. Not wanting to get ticketed for driving without a car seat, Watkins had the passenger put the baby in the truck through an opening in the back seat. She then had the passenger close the opening and continued to drive before being pulled over. Watkins was arrested on seven charges including child abuse, resisting an officer, driving without a license and failure to have a child restraint. She was held overnight at Broward County Jail on $7,000 bond.","Breona Synclair Watkins, 19, was pulled over around 1am Tuesday morning .

"Gordon Strachan compared Scotland's bruising, euphoric victory over the Republic of Ireland to a heavyweight title fight. Shaun Maloney's sublime goal 15 minutes from the end of a tight, nip-and-tuck qualifier with the Irish completed a memorable and crucial Euro 2016 victory. Drawing level with the Republic on seven points after Poland's emphatic 4-0 win in Georgia, the Scots secured all three points in a frenetic clash. VIDEOS Scroll down to watch . Shaun Maloney (left) celebrates as Steven Naismith (centre) gives chase after Scotland open the scoring . Strachan will now ring the changes for Tuesday's friendly with England after admitting the game wrung every ounce of effort from his men. 'I think so,' confirmed the Scots boss. 'They put so much into that game tonight. That was like one of those big heavyweight boxing matches. 'I absolutely wouldn't second-guess the outcome of this group now.' The Scots had some sterling individual displays in goalscorer Maloney and man-of-the-match Charlie Mulgrew, called into midfield after an illness to James Morrison before the game. 'Charlie was immense, absolutely immense,' said Strachan. 'Normally we would come in here and say: 'What a game Scott Brown has had'. But Charlie has actually taken the mantle tonight and ably backed up by the people round about him. Scotland manager Gordon Strachan celebrates on the touchline at full-time as his side win 1-0 . 'I am really pleased with Shaun as well, as I am with Steven Naismith, Ikechi Anya and others but Charlie was the best man on the pitch I think — ably backed by the others. 'But the smaller ones like Andrew Robertson, Maloney, Naismith and Anya showed brave play when the ball was flying about and there were tackles everywhere. 'They showed bravery on the ball.' Poland's triumph in Tblisi ramped up the pressure on the Scots before kick-off. Strachan had dismissed talk of a 'must-win' beforehand, but the joyous celebrations of the Tartan Army afterwards told another tale. 'People have been telling me since the Georgia game it is must-win,' the Scotland boss said. 'They said it before Poland and this one. Every game seems to be a must-win. 'I said before the game that one goal had decided all of the previous games in the group, apart from the one involving Gibraltar. It has happened again. 'We did say set plays were going to be vital and it happened. 'As for a pure footballing spectacle, it wasn't that great. Maloney curls a low strike into the far corner as Scotland take the lead in Glasgow on Friday . 'But as a spectacle of two groups of players not wanting to give an inch, it was mesmerising. They all wanted to jump higher than each other, run quicker and battle harder.' The Scots blew a raft of chances in both halves and survived a moment of anxiety in injury time when Grant Hanley's defensive header almost spun into his own net, crashing off the bar. Insisting his team now believe in themselves after one defeat in four matches — to world champions Germany in the opener — Strachan added: 'When we've played we've believed we can play football. Tonight it was a more physical duel. Charlie Mulgrew (centre) celebrates the victory as Scotland move up to third in Group D . 'We dealt with that as well because the players trust each other. 'They know fine well if they're not having a great night the guy next to him will help them out. 'And I think that's what happened tonight.' Asked what his over-riding emotions were ahead of an England friendly at the same venue, Strachan said: 'There are lot of emotions chucked in there, every emotion possible. But the good thing is I can go home, get to my bed and chill. That's what I'll do, go home and watch a bit of telly and fall asleep. I'm looking forward to that.' Steven Fletcher will miss the England game after limping off in the second half with an ankle injury.","Scotland beat the Republic of Ireland 1-0 at Celtic Park on Friday night .

"Researchers claim an age bias in the NHS is denying the elderly of life-saving cancer treatment. Stock picture used . The elderly are being denied life-saving cancer surgery due to an age bias in the NHS, researchers warn. They found that patients’ chances of undergoing vital operations decline sharply with age for all of the most common types of tumour. For prostate cancer, almost nobody has surgery once they reach 75 whereas it is offered to more than a quarter of men under 55. And women with ovarian cancer over the age of 75 are half as likely to have surgery as those under 55, according to a major study by Cancer Research UK. Britain has among the worst cancer survival rates in Western Europe and the gap is even wider for the elderly who are more likely to die from the disease than those in France, Germany and Scandinavia. One explanation is that they are being written off before the first consultation by doctors who only look at their date of birth. Nick Ormiston-Smith, Cancer Research UK’s head of statistics, said: ‘These figures provide further detail about the age bias that older cancer patients face. If older patients are not being offered a surgical option, that is wrong. ‘We do have lower treatment rates than other countries and this is more pronounced in older people. We have lower survival rates in older people, that could be explained by lower access to treatment.’ The research – overseen by the National Cancer Intelligence Network, the government agency which analyses data – looked at 367,000 patients who underwent surgery in England between 2006 and 2010. This covered 21 types of cancer and for each one, academics worked out the percentage of patients having surgery in five age groups. They found that while 29 per cent of men with prostate cancer aged 15 to 54 had surgery, it fell to 0.1 per cent for those aged 75 to 84 – and nobody had it over 85. This means that just 48 potentially life-saving operations to remove prostate cancer are carried out in men over 75 in England every year. For women with ovarian cancer, just 37 per cent aged 75 to 84 had operations to remove tumours compared to 89 per cent in the 15 to 54 age group. Duleep Allirajah, head of policy at the charity Macmillan Cancer Support, said: ‘This is yet more upsetting evidence that older cancer patients in England are getting a raw deal, despite the fact that half of people diagnosed with cancer are in this age bracket.’ The table above shows the likelihood of cancer surgery for each age group as a percentage . Surgery is considered the most effective treatment for cancer and is responsible for half of the cases where the illness is cured. Not all elderly patients will be suitable for treatment and those with other health problems such as dementia or heart disease may just be too frail. Others may not want to undergo a potentially risky procedure particularly if they would also need gruelling chemotherapy. In October 2012 new laws came into force banning all NHS staff from denying any treatment to the elderly based on their age alone. Although this research took place two years before this came into force, there is ample evidence the age discrimination is still widespread. Sean Duffy, national clinical director for cancer at NHS England, said: ‘A person’s age should not be a barrier to getting the most effective treatments. It’s clear that more needs to be done to ensure older patients have equal access to treatment.’ Hundreds of thousands of cancer patients are going through the distressing ordeal of hospital treatment on their own, figures show. The charity Macmillan Cancer Support estimates that 89 per cent of those with the illness went to at least one appointment alone – the equivalent of 270,000 sufferers in the UK a year. Nearly a third said it was because they didn’t want to be a burden or that a relative or close friend wasn’t available. One in 20 patients said they had no choice as there wasn’t anyone to ask. Many patients say they feel incredibly lonely having to sit around for hours waiting for chemotherapy, radiotherapy or an appointment where they might be given bad news. Jacqui Graves, head of health and social care for Macmillan Cancer Support which surveyed 2,000 cancer patients, said: ‘It is deeply saddening that cancer patients are facing one of the most frightening moments of their lives without having anyone with them to offer support.’","Researches claim elderly have lower chance of undergoing cancer surgery .

"Mark Wahlberg is seeking a pardon from the state of Massachusetts for a vicious racially-charged attack he committed as a teenager that left a man blind in one eye. Court documents reveal just how horrifying the 1988 attack was - including startling racial slurs he shouted at the victim and others - but the actor insists he is now 'a better person and citizen'. Wahlberg, who served 45 days in jail after the assault, says his record continues to impact him and could prevent businesses, such as restaurants, that work with him from getting licenses. He insists he has come a long way since April 1988, when he attacked Thanh Lam with a five-foot stick while yelling slurs at him in order to steal the two cases of beer he was carrying. Scroll down for video . Troubled past: Mark Wahlberg served 45 days in prison after he blinded a man in a 1988 assault . Documents included in his pardon request show he called the Vietnamese immigrant a 'Vietnam f***ing s***' before striking him so hard that the stick broke in two and knocked Lam unconscious, according to the documents shared by The Smoking Gun. He then fled the scene and approached a second man, Hoa Trinh, put his arm around his shoulder and asked him to help him hide. But once police passed, Wahlberg hit him, leaving him blind in one eye. When Boston cops tracked Wahlberg down and took him back back to the scene of the assault outside a convenience store in Dorchester, he told officers: 'You don't have to let him identify me, I'll tell you now that's the motherf***** whose head I split open', the documents show. Authorities wrote that he also made 'numerous unsolicited racial statements about 'gooks' and ""slant-eyed gooks"".' In his plea, Wahlberg said that he was under the influence of alcohol and drugs at the time. 'From later accounts of the incident, it is my understanding that I may have caused serious injuries'  to the men, he wrote. Other documents show that, in an earlier attack in Dorchester, he and two friends saw a group of black siblings and chased them. Changed man: Now, Wahlberg is hoping to get a pardon for his past actions . Scene of the crime: The liquor store where Wahlberg attacked a man with a stick and then ran away . 'We don't like black n****** in the area so get the f*** away from the area,' the boys shouted at the group, according to the documents. They then chased the boys, shouting: 'Kill the n*****, kill the n*****'. The following day, the group encountered one of the boys again and threw rocks at him. One of the rocks thrown by Wahlberg and one of his friends hit a nearby girl. The trio caused 'a high level of anxiety, fear and intimidation', the documents said. Though he was then only 16 at the time of the 1988 attack, he was charged as an adult and convicted of assault. According to NECN the initial charge was attempted murder. After emerging from prison, Wahlberg went on to find success in music with Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch and as a Calvin Klein model. Family guy: Wahlberg (above with wife Rhea Durham and three of his children and Kevin Hart) is now committed to multiple charities and attends church every day . But it was his appearance in the 1996 film Boogie Nights that really changed things, catapulting Wahlberg into the critically-acclaimed box office juggernaut that he is today. 'I am deeply sorry for the actions that I took on the night of April 8, 1988, as well as for any lasting damage that I may have caused the victims,' Wahlberg wrote in the pardon application. 'Since that time, I have dedicated myself to becoming a better person and citizen so that I can be a role model to my children and others.' He devotes much of his time and a large amount of his money to various charities, including the Mark Wahlberg Youth Foundation and the Dorchester Boys and Girls Club. He is also a family man now, married to former model Rhea Durham and the father of four children, and attends church daily. The Board of Pardons will investigate the petition to decide if it warrants a hearing before it is recommended to the governor who by that time will be the recently elected Charlie Baker. Pardon? It will ultimately be up to newly elected Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker (above) to decide whether or not Wahlberg should be pardoned . And while erasing the past is important, Wahlberg points out that he still talks about what he did to show how much a person can change. But he said that, as a convicted criminal, there are still some things he cannot do  and for that he needs a pardon, including working with law enforcement to help at-risk youth. In the end, however, it is about showing his growth. 'The more complex answer is that receiving a pardon would be a formal recognition that I am not the same person that I was on the night of April 8, 1988,' Wahlberg explains. 'It would be formal recognition that someone like me can receive official public redemption if he devotes himself to personal improvement and a life of good works.'","Mark Wahlberg is seeking a pardon from the state of Massachusetts for an assault he committed in 1988 that left a man blind in one eye .

"Five officials with connections to FIFA and who were all involved in the bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 World Cups are at the centre of a Swiss criminal investigation, according to the man who wants to be FIFA’s next president. And Jerome Champagne, a former long-standing FIFA insider who is the only currently declared rival to Sepp Blatter for next year’s presidential race, has told the Mail on Sunday that if any of the five are found guilty of wrong-doing, the entire bidding process should be invalidated. Russia was awarded the 2018 tournament and Qatar the 2022 event in a vote that happened four years ago next month. But corruption allegations have persistently swirled around those decisions and FIFA announced last week they had lodged a criminal complaint with the Office of the Attorney General of Switzerland into ‘the possible misconduct of individual persons in connection with the awarding of the hosting rights of the 2018 and 2022 World Cups.’ Jerome Champagne told the Mail on Sunday that five FIFA officials are to face a Swiss criminal investigation . No information has been confirmed by FIFA about the number of individuals or their identities although it is believed more than one are FIFA ExCo voters who influenced the destination of the 2018 and 2022 events. This development came amid the ongoing controversy of the FIFA ethics judge Hans-Joachim Eckert’s summary of FIFA investigator Michael Garcia’s investigation into the process. ‘I am a strong defender of the principle of innocent until proven guilty but it is clear that what is at stake is enormous,’ Champagne told The Mail on Sunday. ‘We need to know how the voting unfolded and how it was influenced. Even if one vote was improperly influenced that is too many. ‘Was it one or none? Or five? If it was five then is that enough to change outcome? Yes. Qatar won 14-8. The problem is we need to know and we don’t know.’ Corruption allegations have swirled around the decision to award Russia and Qatar World Cups . Champagne added that it is his belief that FIFA’s probe into corruption allegations is effectively ongoing. ‘It is an unfinished FIFA ethics investigation … the request [to the Swiss Attorney General] is about five officials of FIFA.’ Champagne called for the full findings of Garcia’s report to be made public, even though Eckert has insisted that will never happen. ‘I’ve consistently and repeatedly called for transparency,’ Champagne said. ‘What has happened over the past week only reinforces the need for that, more than ever. ‘It has been almost four since that vote on 2 December 2010 and it continues to make me sad that the World Cup, the pinnacle of our game, remains tainted. We need to know what happened.’ This Brazilian fan holds up a sign towards the end of the 2014 World Cup, saying 'See you Russia 2018' Eckert’s 42-page summary caused huge controversy in identifying - and then traducing - two whistleblowers who gave extensive assistance to Garcia. Bonita Mersiades, a former Australian bid insider, and Phaedra Almajid, who worked for Qatar 2022, spoke out in these pages last week about their disgust at their treatment. They both subsequently made formal complaints to FIFA about Eckert allegedly breaching article 16.1 of FIFA’s own ethics code in making them clearly identifiable in his summary. They have not even received any acknowledgement of their complaint, let alone any explanation. ‘I was stunned that the whistleblowers were described in the way they were so that they could be identified,’ Champagne says. ‘They are courageous people and they were failed by this report.’ Eckert effectively dismissed both Mersiades and Almajid as inaccurate and unreliable. But the Mail on Sunday can exclusively reveal that Garcia found them so valuable to his intelligence-gathering that he used tens of thousands of dollars of FIFA money to facilitate meeting them. Meanwhile, campaigning MP Damian Collins, who has a track record of pushing for FIFA reform, has secured a parliamentary debate on December 1 in the House of Commons on the subject of the Serious Fraud Office and FIFA. It is expected that various allegations of corruption surrounding the world governing body and the 2018 and 2022 process will be aired under parliamentary privilege.","Jerome Champagne wants to take Sepp Blatter's job as FIFA president .

As much as the Special One wants to escape it, he can’t ignore the ‘U’ word. And nor, it seems, can his players. ‘The unbeaten run is on our minds,’ admitted Oscar. ‘But the team just starts again every time and plays for a win, and if we win or if we draw it is OK. What is important is that we don’t lose. ‘Of course, we feel confident because we are not losing games. So you start confidently, but we need to continue like this.’ With Mourinho around, though, any bouts of over-confidence will be nipped in the bud. The Portuguese, despite his own self-confidence, isn’t one to tolerate arrogance in his players. Before Wednesday’s win over Tottenham, Mourinho was adamant an undefeated season in all competitions was ‘impossible’. As quickly as the subject is broached, the Chelsea manager does his best to leave the issue behind. He views it as unnecessary pressure on his players when he wants them focused on winning matches — not producing an undefeated season. With Manchester City building up a head of steam behind them, Mourinho’s men do not need any other distractions. ‘The manager speaks before every game and he tells us not to be too confident,’ revealed Oscar. ‘Mourinho speaks before the games and makes sure our feet stay on the floor. We have so many games to play and we need to continue to win them. Of course he wants us to stay confident, but not too much because that can be dangerous. ‘He tells the attacking players to go for goals, to play our football, but when you don’t have the ball you have to defend. That is the way we have been winning games.’ Belgium forward Eden Hazard (centre) celebrates after scoring the opening goal against Spurs . Hazard insists the whole team has bought into Mourinho's philosophy of defending without the ball . Chelsea have a six point lead over City at the top . That was backed up by Eden Hazard, who said: ‘Defensively we are very strong. All the players want to defend for the team, even the attacking players, even me. We are very strong and it’s important.’ You could, though, forgive Mourinho for briefly turning his mind to an undefeated campaign. He isn’t new to success but such an achievement would cement his place — if it isn’t already — as one of the greatest managers in history. His squad is certainly strong enough to make a decent fist of it, too. Question marks over how the Blues would deal without the suspended Diego Costa against Spurs were emphatically answered by Didier Drogba who scored one and made another goal in the 3-0 win. It prompted Mourinho to reveal he is keen for the striker to continue playing for the club past his current deal that expires in the summer. Didier Drogba wheels away after turning back the clock with an inspirational performance against Tottenham . Mourinho has hinted that Drogba could stay at Stamford Bridge beyond this season . Sources close to the Blues legend insisted no decision would be made until after talks with Mourinho towards the end of the season. But Oscar made his opinion on Drogba crystal clear, saying: ‘Ah, Didier — he is fantastic. Fantastic player, fantastic person and I am so happy he is a part of the team. ‘I learn from him. He speaks before the game to the attacking players. He wants to score every game. I watched him on TV when I was young, and we now play together.’ They’ll be lifting trophies together soon enough, too.

"New genetic research has revealed that a small group of hunter-gatherers now living in Southern Africa once was so large that it comprised the majority of living humans. Only during the last 22,000 years have the other African ethnicities, including the ones giving rise to Europeans and Asians, have become the bigger populations, researchers say. However, their fall has been quick - the Khoisan (who sometimes call themselves Bushmen) now number about 100,000 individuals, while the rest of humanity numbers 7 billion. Scroll down for video . The Khoisan (who sometimes call themselves Bushmen) now number about 100,000 individuals, while the rest of humanity numbers 7 billion. however, they once comprised the biggest group on Earth, new analysis has found. The Khoisan speak in 'click' languages, and have also maintained the greatest genetic diversity known among human populations. The distinct clicks of their language have been incorporated into Zulu and Xhosa speech. They have also contributed to the richness of Afrikaans and South African English with words such as 'eina' (ouch) and 'aikhona' (absolutely not). Khoisan traditions include snuff and makaranga tobacco. This is a very strong tobacco that is mixed with wild honey and made into a paste before being allowed to dry. Their lives and ways have remained unaltered for hundreds of generations, with only recent events endangering their hunter-gatherer lifestyles, according to the study set to be published in Nature Communications. By comparing nearly all the genes of these individuals with the genomes of 1,462 people from around the world, the researchers discovered that the inflow of new genes into the Khoisan peoples has been quite restricted the past 150,000 years, indicating that this large hunter-gatherer culture was physically isolated for most of its history and that its men typically did not take wives from outside the group. 'Khoisan hunter-gatherers in Southern Africa always have perceived themselves as the oldest people' said Stephan Schuster, a former Penn State University professor now at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. Researchers on the project included scientists at Penn State and other research universities in the United States, Brazil, and Singapore. The Nature Communication paper analyses five study participants from different tribes in Namibia. The study investigated 420,000 genetic variants across 1,462 genomes from 48 ethnic groups in populations worldwide. These analyses reveal that Southern African Khoisans are genetically distinct not only from Europeans and Asians, but also from all other Africans. Video kind courtesy of FOP Films. The Khoisan speak in 'click' languages, and have also maintained the greatest genetic diversity known among human populations. The paper's first author Hie Lim Kim, formerly at Penn State and now at Nanyang Technological University, said 'It is fascinating to unravel the population history of humankind over the last 150,000 years.' By conducting extensive computational analyses, the team demonstrated that two of the sequenced individuals showed no signs of having inherited any genetic material from members of other ethnic groups. Interestingly, these individuals are the oldest members of the Ju/'hoansi tribe, which still live in protected areas of Northwest Namibia. 'This and previous studies show that the Khoisan peoples and the rest of modern humanity shared their most recent common ancestor approximately 150,000 years ago, so it was entirely unexpected to find that this group apparently did not intermarry with non-Khoisan neighbors for many thousand years,' said Webb Miller, professor of Bioinformatics at Penn State and a member of the research team. 'The current Khoisan culture and tradition, where marriage occurs either among Khoisan groups or results in female members leaving their tribes after marrying non-Khoisan men, appears to be long-standing.' The Khoisan tribes, found in southern Africa, lived in near-isolation from the rest of humanity for thousands of years. The distribution of the three language families spoken by Khoisan people is shown on this map in green . The cultural and genetic persistence of the Ju/'hoansi tribe is intriguing, the researchers say, because genetic and genomic analysis of ancient hominid lineages such as the Neanderthals, as well as non-African humans, have shown that intermarrying does occur frequently in these groups and is traceable over the entire time span of 150,000 history during which anatomically modern humans have lived. 'We also observed gene flow for some of the other Khoisan groups, as defined by their largely varying language, but a key finding of this study is that, even today, individuals without genes from other communities can be identified within the Ju/'hoansi population and possibly others,' Schuster said. 'Having identified non-admixed Khoisan individuals, we could compare the effective population size of the Khoisan with that of other humans over more than 100,000 years,' said research-team memberAakrosh Ratan, an assistant professor at the University of Virginia. 'In a twist of fate, the major ethnic groups today in Africa, Asia, and Europe increased in size only after overcoming a population decline about 20,000 years ago.' The researchers also investigated the hypothesis that climatic changes resulted in less-favorable living conditions, first in Western Africa and later in all of central sub-Saharan Africa. 'Using a paleoclimate model and data, we were able to show that glaciation in the northern hemisphere resulted in drier conditions in Western/Central Africa, while wetter conditions prevailed in Southern Africa,' said Alvaro Montenegro, an assistant professor at Ohio State University and the Sao Paulo State University in Brazil. 'A hypothesis suggested by our new study is that the wetter climate conditions in the Khoisan-inhabited parts of Southern Africa may have resulted in more-favorable living conditions.' Researchers previously identified two migrations: One about 3,000 years ago, of non-Africans entering east Africa, and a second one 900–1,800 years ago.","Khoisan, or Bushmen, now number about 100,000 individuals .

"Demonstrators marching from Ferguson to Missouri's capital to protest the police shooting death of Michael Brown were met with opposition as they passed through a rural town. Some people in Rosebud, population 400, shouted racial epithets and held signs telling them to 'go home.' According to the Missourian, the marchers even encountered a 'display of fried chicken, a melon and a 40-ounce beer bottle' that was placed in the street. Scroll down for video . Racist reception: Activists marching Wednesday in response to the Michael Brown verdict got a racist reception as they passed through the town of Rosebud, Missouri on a 120-mile trek to the state capital . Shocking: One stared down the group of 50 marchers on the Journey for Justice through what was quite clearly a nod to the Ku Klux Klan hoods the once struck terror in black communities across America . Several of the 200 or so protesters held signs, like this boy's which read 'Hands down! Go to work!'--a joke about what has become the call to arms for recent protests, 'Hands up, don't shoot' In video taken as the group passed through the tiny town, marchers appeared to keep their heads high as the hostile protesters--one of them wearing something akin to a KKK hood--yelled obscenities and told them to get back to work. I've been brought up to know how to deal with people like that,' marcher Cheyenne Willis told the Missourian. 'I ignore them and keep moving forward...The comments that we saw are pure ignorance.' The Missourian reports that at least one person displayed a Confederate flag, and the back window of a bus traveling with the marchers was broken by a bullet. The protest march began after a grand jury decided last week not to indict Ferguson Police Officer Darren Wilson, who was white, for the Aug. 9 shooting of Brown, who was black and unarmed. Activists gathered in Ferguson, Missouri, on Saturday to begin a 120-mile march to the state capital Jefferson City to protest the killing of an unarmed black teen by a white police officer, a case that has rekindled a national debate over U.S. race relations. Unwelcome: The group stood along the marchers' route and angrily yelled as they passed by . Many of the counter-protesters said they were out to support the police, specifically Officer Wilson . About 100 people were expected to take part in the seven-day march organized by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), with more joining segments of the long walk, NAACP staff member Jamiah Adams told Reuters. The march, which is reminiscent of the civil rights marches of the 1960's, was set to begin at midday on Saturday at the Canfield Green Apartments, the residential complex near where 18-year-old Michael Brown was shot and killed on Aug. 9 by Ferguson police Officer Darren Wilson. A grand jury's decision not to charge Wilson ignited protests in Ferguson and a riot that left buildings torched and stores looted. The NAACP expects about 1,000 people to be part of the final leg of the ""Journey for Justice"" march. The civil rights group is asking participants to protect themselves against icy conditions expected along the route by wearing hand warmers and wool socks. The NAACP is also calling for a new police chief in Ferguson and a national law to prevent racial profiling by police.","The 7-day Journey for Justice march to Jefferson was met by some 200 angry protesters in the town of Rosebud on Wednesday .

"After Arsenal qualified for the second round of the Champions League for the 15th successive season, Arsene Wenger joked that he would send someone different to the draw. When they have played their final group game against Galatasaray in Istanbul next month, where Wenger is ‘90 per cent’ sure they will finish second in the group, the last 16 will hold all the usual pitfalls. It is an achievement to reach the second round, but nothing more than that. Arsenal beat Borussia Dortmund at the Emirates on Wednesday to qualify for the last 16 . Yaya Sanogo celebrates scoring his first Arsenal goal with supporters at the Emirates Stadium . 1. Real Madrid (£411.5m) 2. Barcelona (£382.39m) 3. Bayern Munich (£341.66m) 4. Manchester United (£335.80) 5. Paris St Germain (£316m) 6. Manchester City (£250.54m) 7. Chelsea (£240.4m) 8. Arsenal (£225.26) Based on Arsenal’s status within the game, progressing to the last 16 of the Champions League is standard for a club of this size. They are up there now with the biggest teams in the world and expectations at a club with the commercial clout of Arsenal are high. This club charges more than any other to watch their football and yet they consistently sell their supporters short in the Champions League. They are much, much bigger than the club will allow you to believe because it gets them off the hook when they are beaten by Bayern Munich or Barcelona when the competition gets serious. The minimum acceptable target for one of the biggest teams in world football is to reach the quarter-finals as a matter of course. Arsenal's victory over Dortmund meant they have now qualified for the second round 15 years in a row . Alexis Sanchez celebrates after scoring in Arsenal's 2-0 victory on Wednesday . Arsene Wenger's side are yet to win the competition despite making the second round 15 years in a row . 1. Manchester City (£102,653 per week) 2. Real Madrid (£96,027) 3. Barcelona (£94,256) 4. Bayern Munich (£84,671) 5. Manchester United (£83,120) 6. Chelsea (£76,626) 7. Arsenal (£75,037) (average wage per player) At least Wenger, who developed an obsession with the competition, accepts that it is not enough to reach the second phase. He wants more, just as he did when his team came close to beating Barcelona in the 2006 Champions League final in the Stade de France. ‘When you work at the football club we realise it’s not a waste to have that continuity and consistency and I’m very proud of that,’ he admitted. ‘The club deserves a lot of credit for that. But it’s not enough. We want more than that.’ His ambition is admirable, but this club is geared up for far more than the occasional appearance in the quarter-final of the competition. Arsenal's team may not be as expensively assembled as their rivals, but their wage bill is right up there . Arsenal were beaten 2-1 by Barcelona in the 2006 final at the Stade de France in Paris . Steven Gerrard scores a penalty in Liverpool's 5-3 quarter-final victory in 2008 . 1. Borussia Dortmund (80,295) 2. Manchester United (75,205) 3. Barcelona (72,115) 4. Real Madrid (71,565) 5. Bayern (71,000) 6. Schalke 04 (61,570) 7. Arsenal (60,015) (average attendances per game) Since reaching the final in 2006, they have lost in the second round to PSV Eindhoven, Barcelona, Milan and Bayern Munich (twice). They were beaten by Liverpool in 2008, cuffed by Manchester United in the second leg of the semi-final in 2009 and taken apart by Barcelona in 2010, when they lost 6-3 on aggregate. Winning it takes a special team and a good slice of luck, but we still laud the achievements of 10-time winners Real Madrid, Milan (7), Bayern (5), Liverpool (5), Barcelona (4) and Ajax (4). Every which way you look at the set-up around the Emirates, from matchday revenue to salaries to stadium and training ground facilities to transfers, Arsenal should be doing better in Europe. According to Deloitte’s Money League, published last January, Arsenal are the eighth biggest club in European football by revenue. Last year, Arsenal were beaten 3-1 on aggregate by Bayern Munich in the first knockout round . David Villa scores for Barcelona as they beat Arsenal 4-3 on aggregate in the last 16 in 2011 . Here they are: Real Madrid (£411.5m), Barcelona (£382.39m), Bayern Munich (£341.66m), Manchester United (£335.80), Paris St Germain (£316m), Manchester City (£250.54m), Chelsea (£240.4m) and Arsenal (£225.26). In terms of wages, sportingintelligence.com’s salary survey, which was published in April claims the Arsenal squad have the seventh biggest wage packets in world football. Here is the list: Manchester City (£102,653 per week), Real Madrid (£96,027), Barcelona (£94,256), Bayern Munich (£84,671), Manchester United (£83,120), Chelsea (£76,626) and Arsenal (£75,037). This team, which qualified for the next phase of the competition after beating Borussia Dortmund 2-0 last night, also has the seventh biggest attendances in European football. Borussia Dortmund (80,295), Manchester United (75,205), Barcelona (72,115), Real Madrid (71,565), Bayern (71,000), Schalke 04 (61,570) and Arsenal (60,015). With a state-of-the-art stadium, always packed with fans, Arsenal need to start acting like a club of their size . Manchester United got the better of Arsenal in 2009 in the Champions League semi-finals . Where Arsenal really are streets ahead of the competition is, of course, their season ticket prices. That is where their fans are forced to pay through the nose. According to a BBC study last month, the cheapest season ticket at the Emirates is £1014, although this does include seven cup credits on top of 19 games in the Barclays Premier League. Remember, you can buy a season ticket to watch Cristiano Ronaldo play every other week at Real Madrid, who won the Champions League last season, for £174.65. You can watch the other best player in the world Lionel Messi, who has already won the Champions League three times, at the Nou Camp for £103.38. The seats will be up in the gods, but Barcelona fans can still get to watch a genuine great setting records. A season ticket to watch Real Madrid play costs as little as £174.65 . A season ticket to watch Lionel Messi's Barcelona in action starts at £103.38 . At Arsenal, where ticket prices can fetch £97 for a seat, they get to admire the brilliance of Alexis Sanchez now that he is wearing their famous red and white shirt. It is something of a shame that Arsenal continue to announce their official attendance because it is actually the number of seats sold. Last night, for example, there were perhaps 5,000 more empty seats dotted around the stadium. Still, the cash has already been counted from the fans who pay through the nose to watch this team and that means they can pay the bills. When the draw for the second round of the Champions League on December 15, it is time for Arsenal to pay them back.","Arsenal beat Borussia Dortmund on Wednesday to seal place in last 16 .
Victory means Arsenal have reached second round 15 years in a row .
Arsenal have eighth highest revenue and seventh highest wage bill .
North London club have seventh highest attendance in Europe .

"A Hawaiian man has claimed the Guinness World Record for the largest non-surgically made stretch earlobes - which are so big you can fit a hand through them. Kala Kaiwi, who unsurprisingly works as a tattoo and body modification artist, has earlobe stretches or 'flesh tunnels' measuring 109mm (4.3 inches) in diameter, to go with his hundreds of other wacky body adaptations. He has just returned from Milan, Italy where he picked up his award, almost certainly setting off airport security scanners on his way. Kala Kaiwi is the new Guinness World Record holder for the largest non-surgically made stretch earlobes in the world. They measure 109mm in diameter and can fit a hand through . Kala has hundreds of other body modifications, including nostril piercings, face tattoos and horns on his head . Along with his flesh tunnels, he has had silicon horns implanted on his head, stretches in his nostrils, tattooed eyebrows and studs all over his face. He even split his own tongue using dental floss, and has bolt holes on his forehead with spikes screwed in. Kala trained in Las Vegas in 1999 before moving back to Hawaii to open Sin City Body Modification and Tattoo shop. To find out more about Kala Kaiwi and body modification click here . Ear stretches have become increasingly popular in recent years. The practice originated from indigenous people but has now become mainstream in the western world. Ancient Egyptian Pharaoh King Tutankhamen is known to have had them, although these days, you are far more likely to see them on a regular person than you are royalty. The trendsetter was Otzi the Ice Man, who dates all the way back to 3300BC and is the oldest human mummy in the world. He was discovered by German tourists in the Italian Alps in 1991 and as well as having 7-11mm ear stretches, he is covered in tattoos. When they first filtered into western cultures they were adopted by subcultures such as punks and rockers, but nowadays, you can find stretches on celebrities such as McBusted's Dougie Poynter or rapper Lil Wayne, as well as all over the streets of any town or city. However, extra large flesh tunnels are still associated with counter culture. Professor Victoria Pitts-Taylor, from the Graduate Center of the City University of New York, says they are 'a slightly more committed body art than temporary practices or ear piercing. The more you stretch the skin, the more commitment you are expressing to a counter cultural look.'","Kala Kaiwi now holds record for largest 'non-surgically made' flesh tunnels .

"Organizers of a University of Missouri demonstration held Tuesday in protest of the exoneration of Darren Wilson asked that 'only people of color' participate in their 'die-in.' The group's email blast about the event asked  'non-people of color to stand holding hands in solidarity' at the Columbia, Missouri campus event.

The College Fix spoke to one organizer about the decision. 'The ""die-in"" is meant to represent black bodies that are killed unjustly. It was requested that others stand in a circle holding hands,' explained student Ebony Francis. The demonstration lasted four-and-a-half minutes as a nod to the four-and-a-half hours that Michael Brown's body lay on the street after he was shot dead by Officer Darren Wilson. Demonstrations lasted about an hour and a half total on Tuesday and were meant to protest the grand jury decision not to indict Wilson. It was also meant as a demand for an equal justice system. One student told the College Fix that demonstrators failed, at least with that goal. 'If they are trying to make a message that is against racism,' said junior Daniel Beaman, 'I think they may have failed. The email makes it appear as if white people are not victims of police brutality. Like it’s only a black issue.'

"The two Americans killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip followed in the footsteps of scores of Jews from around the world who have volunteered to fight for Israel. Israel calls them the lone soldiers: They are men and women in the prime of their lives who have left their parents and often comfortable lives behind in places like Sydney, London, Los Angeles and elsewhere to join the Israel Defense Forces, marching in the desert and taking up arms to defend the Jewish state. There are about 2,000 lone soldiers currently serving in the military, said Marina Rozhansky, spokeswoman at the Israel Consul General in Los Angeles. Max Steinberg, left, grew up in Southern California's San Fernando Valley and Nissim Sean Carmeli, 21  right, was from South Padre Island, Texas. The two Americans killed in fighting in the Gaza Strip . Groups for families of lone soldiers have recently started in Los Angeles and other cities, providing a support network as the fighting intensifies. For Jews who left Israel before the age of 15 or who never lived there, their service is voluntary. For many, it is a calling, a way to get back to their roots and unite the world's Jewish population. Some have dual citizenship. Others speak little to no Hebrew and have only recently been to Israel. Max Steinberg, 24 , joined six months after he visited Israel for the first time on a Birthright Israel trip with his younger brother and sister in June 2012, according to his brother Jake Steinberg . Max was a sharpshooter in the Golani Brigade, was among 13 Israeli soldiers and scores of Palestinians over the weekend who died during the first major ground battle in two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas .

Max was a sharpshooter in the Golani Brigade, was among 13 Israeli soldiers and scores of Palestinians over the weekend who died during the first major ground battle in two weeks of fighting between Israel and Hamas. The Jewish Journal was first to report Steinberg's death. 'He got there and felt a connection to Israel, saw that as a place he could live and be successful, and he went for it,' Jake Steinberg said. Israeli soldiers carry the coffin of Sgt. Nissim Sean Carmeli, during his funeral at the military cemetery in the northern Israeli city of Haifa . Thousands of people attended Carmeli's funeral in the northern Israeli port town of Haifa after a Facebook status called for Israelis to come in droves so that the lone soldier would be not be alone at this final resting place. Carmeli was the youngest of three and has two sisters who currently live in Israel. He was 'loved by his parents infinitely' Nissim Sean Carmeli, 21, the second American killed, was from South Padre Island, Texas, and he felt that same strong connection to the country he had only moved to four years ago. 'Lone soldiers are a kind of star in Israel,' according to the Jewish Journal in a report. 'For Israeli kids, army service is a rite of passage. But because it is a choice for the young members of the Diaspora who re-direct their own life paths to protect Israel, those enlistees are given a hero's welcome - and a lifetime of Shabbat dinner invitations from their fellow soldiers, who become their surrogate families.' Thousands of people attended Carmeli's funeral in the northern Israeli port town of Haifa after a Facebook status called for Israelis to come in droves so that the lone soldier would be not be alone at this final resting place. Tearful mourners rested their heads on his coffin, which was draped in an Israeli flag. Before it was lowered into the grave, piles of flowers were set upon the coffin, as mourners cried beside it. Mike Fishbein, who grew up in Los Angeles, said he felt like he was missing a connection to his Jewish identity in California. He spent a year volunteering and studying in Israel, but that experience only deepened his desire to do more.

I believe in the Jewish people and the country's reason to exist, so I thought I can't just go back home to Los Angeles,' said Fishbein, who served about two years with the Israel Defense Forces starting in 2009. After Fishbein enlisted, he spent 30 days learning Hebrew along with more than two dozen others from Panama, South Africa, Australia and other nations. He then went through basic training, which included a 40-mile nighttime march through the desert. He lived for almost four months inside a worn tent from the Vietnam War era. Israeli troops wondered why he would leave the palm trees and beaches they had seen in movies. 'They didn't understand why a kid from Hollywood was there,' he said. 'But after you stuck around, they would respect you and understand (that) we're here together to try and protect the same thing.' When Fishbein heard of the two Americans killed, it touched him deeply, he said. He has struggled to post on his Facebook page his emotions or even give an explanation to his friends in California as to why he felt the need to serve. He never wanted to join the U.S. armed forces, Fishbein said.

In ninth grade, he accompanied his father with a documentary crew filming the unearthing of Jewish artefacts in a once largely Jewish town in Poland that was destroyed in the Holocaust. 'That was a surreal experience for a ninth-grade kid to go through, but it set me up to go to Israel and serve,' he said. 'Every lone soldier has had something similar.'

He served in the same unit as the two Americans killed during the weekend. He did not know either of them, but he did know one of the fallen Israeli troops. Reznick believes the Steinberg and Carmeli will be 'shining examples' for other lone soldiers. He was inspired by Michael Levin, a lone soldier from Pennsylvania killed fighting for Israel in 2006. He visited his grave site in Israel, where his tombstone is covered in Phillies baseball hats and Eagles jerseys. 'It's very nice living in America and everything is fine. But I'm sure people right before WWII felt the same way about living in Germany,' he said. 'If only there had been a place to run to for the Jews. That's why it's important to keep Israel, a Jewish nation, alive.' Isaac Cohen, 18, of Silver Spring, Maryland, starts this month at an Israeli military prep school before joining the army next year. He isn't deterred by the recent violence. 'They teach you how to survive in Israel,' said Cohen, who lived there for six years. 'You kind of have to survive there. I feel a lot stronger when I'm there.'","Men and women join the Israel Defense Forces to defend the Jewish state .

"The homeowner accused of deliberately shooting dead a German exchange student allegedly told his barber just days before: 'I've been up three night with a shotgun waiting to kill some kids'. Markus Kaarma is charged with baiting Diren Dede, 17, into his garage on April 27 before firing at him four times with a shotgun. It came weeks after two teenagers stole from Kaarma's garage - a move prosecutors say  sparked the Montana father-of-one to plot his revenge. Kaarma has pleaded not guilty and claimed that he was legally defending his life and his property when he opened fire. But that argument took a blow today as his hair stylist Tanya Colby told a court he said: 'I've been up three night with a shotgun waiting to kill some kids.' He added: 'I'm not kidding, you're seriously going to see this on the news,' she claimed. Case opened: Markus Kaarma listened as the court heard he said he was waiting to kill teenagers with a gun . The development came as prosecutors opened their case on Thursday. On the first day of testimony, two teenagers, Mykle Martin, 17, and Trsitan Staber, 18, described how they went 'garage hopping,' or burglarizing garages, in search of alcohol and other things after dark and hit Markus Kaarma's house. Martin and Staber have been convicted in the incident in which they stole a wallet, marijuana, alcohol and an iPhone from Kaarma's garage about a week before Dede was shot. Staber said he acted as lookout while Martin stole the items. 'I was the previous break-in,' Martin said, his voice at times barely audible. 'I'm the reason he (Kaarma) was waiting for another person.' Both teens said Kaarma and his partner made a call to Karma's iPhone. Staber said he heard Kaarma's partner Janelle Pflager make a threat; Martin said the couple didn't. Victim: Diren Dede (left), 17, was shot dead on April 27 after allegedly breaking into Kaarma's garage . Tearful: Dede's mother Gulcin (left) and father Celal (center) were emotional as they watched proceedings . Kaarma has pleaded not guilty to deliberate homicide, citing fear of harm to his family and property after he had been burglarized twice before the shooting. Deputy County Attorney Jennifer Clark said Kaarma gave no warning before firing in the darkened garage four times after tripping the motion sensor, and that Kaarma paused between the third and fourth shots. 'Neighbors heard the sequence of shots,' Clark said. 'They heard boom, boom, boom, pause, boom.' She held the pump-action shotgun used in the slaying and simulated firing it. Clark said Dede may have been crouching behind a car after the first shots were fired. 'We'll be back to ask you to hold this man responsible for deliberately taking the life of Diren Dede,' she said. Days before the shooting, Kaarma had gone for a haircut at a Great Clips and three women from the shop testified Thursday that they heard Kaarma say his house had been burglarized twice and that he had been waiting up nights to shoot an intruder. Arguments: Jennifer Clark, chief criminal deputy county attorney, demonstrates the pump action of the Mossberg 590-series shotgun, which Kaarma used to kill Diren Dede on April 27, 2014, in her opening words . 'I've been up three nights with a shotgun waiting to kill some kids,' hair stylist Tanya Colby said when asked what Kaarma talked about during the hair cut. She said he later told her, 'I'm not kidding, you're seriously going to see this on the news.' Colby also said Kaarma believed police weren't doing anything about the burglaries. Defense attorney Paul Ryan said Montana law allows homeowners to protect their residences with deadly force when they believe they are going to be harmed. Kaarma didn't know whether the person inside the garage was armed, Ryan said. He said Kaarma is a man who doesn't like to be around a lot of people, and he felt targeted and increasingly anxious for the safety Pflager and their infant son after the first burglaries. Montana's 'stand your ground' law makes it easier for people to avoid prosecution in a shooting if they felt an imminent danger, whether or not the person shot was armed. Dede, from the German city of Hamburg, was not carrying a weapon. Dede's parents, Celal and Gulcin Dede, are attending the trial. 'We have lost a bit of our joy for life,' Celal Dede said in a prepared statement to Germany's RTL Television. 'We can no longer laugh, no longer be happy. A huge part of us was taken from our lives - a part that made our family very happy.'","Markus Kaarma fired four bullets into Diren Dede, 17, in his garage .

"Locals in northern New Jersey believe they filmed a black bear hunting for food hours before a 22-year-old hiker was mauled to death in nearby woods at the weekend. Two men splitting wood on Saturday captured a video of a bear going through garbage just a few feet from where they were working, before scampering off into the woods, according to CNN. On Sunday, Darsh Patel,  a senior majoring in information technology and informatics at Rutgers University, was found dead in Apshawa Preserve - about 45 miles northwest of New York City - with a 300-pound bear guarding his body. Officials say the attack was the first fatal bear-human encounter on record in New Jersey. Scroll down for video . Attacks: Northern New Jersey locals captured this black bear looking for food in their garbage in September. Just a day after the footage was shot,  a black bear mauled a 22-year-old student to death in the woods nearby . Patel had been hiking with four friends in the 526-acre woods. The five friends noticed the bear beginning to follow them and ran, splitting up as they did. When they couldn't find Patel, they called police, who found his body about two hours later. The bear was about 30 yards from the body and circling, Department of Environmental Protection spokesman Larry Ragonese said, and wouldn't leave even after officers tried to scare it away by making loud noises and throwing sticks and stones. The male bear was killed with two rifle blasts and is being examined at a state lab for more clues as to why it may have pursued the group of five hikers. Kelcey Burguess, principal biologist and leader of the state Division of Fish and Wildlife's black bear project, said the bear could have been predisposed to attack but more likely was looking for food. State and local officials stressed that bear attacks are rare even in a region of the state that may have as many as 2,400 bruins in its dense forests. 'This is a rare occurrence,' West Milford police Chief Timothy Storbeck said, noting that his department receives six to 12 calls per week regarding bears, usually involving them breaking into trash cans. Locals: Residents in northern New Jersey often spot bears in and around their yards. There are as many 2,400 bruins in the area's dense forests, but until now had never been a fatal human-bear attack . Preserve: This photo from NJUrbanForest.com shows the Apshawa Preserve, a 526-acre park with hiking trails . Wildlife officials believe there is a current shortage of the acorns and berries that bears eat. The hikers had granola bars and water with them, Storbeck said. Officials don't believe the hikers provoked the bear but they may have showed their inexperience when they decided to run. The safest way to handle a bear encounter is to move slowly and not look the bear in the eye, DEP spokesman Larry Ragonese said. New Jersey Division of Fish and Wildlife guidelines direct law enforcement to euthanize 'Category I' bears, which are deemed an 'immediate threat to human safety.' NJ Advance Media reports that the New Jersey State Medical Examiner, the Fish and Wildlife Division of the state Department of Environmental Protection and the West Milford Police Department are looking into the circumstances of Patel's death. Idyllic: The wooded preserve provides hiking trails and a peaceful setting for visitors to the northern New Jersey site . 'Bear sightings are not unusual by any stretch in New Jersey,' said Bob Considine, spokesperson for the Department of Environmental Protection. 'They have been seen in all 21 counties, although they’re obviously most common in the northwest part of the state.' Black bears rarely pose a threat to humans and often retreat when confronted. In 2006, a tabby cat scared a black bear up a tree in West Milford. The bear only climbed down and left after the cat's owner had called it back into the house.","Darsh Patel, 22, was hiking with friends in the Apshawa Preserve in West Milford on Sunday when a bear started following them .

"A Nebraska man described by one prison psychiatrist as a 'psychopath' and 'one of the most dangerous people' the doctor had ever evaluated was found guilty Wednesday of shooting dead four people last summer. Nikko Jenkins, 27, who is representing himself, filed a handwritten motion to the Douglas County District Court last week stating his intention to plead guilty to all felony counts against him. But on Wednesday, he pleaded no contest to the murder counts, eight weapons counts associated with the killings and two separate counts of being a felon with a gun. Judge Peter Bataillon found him guilty of all charges. Scroll down for video . Guilty: Nikko Jenkins, pictured Wednesday, was found guilty of four counts of first-degree murder in the slayings of four Omaha people last summer. He is led from court by Douglas County deputies in Omaha . A no-contest plea acknowledges there is sufficient evidence to convict but is not an admittance of guilt. Prosecutors say Jenkins shot Juan Uribe-Pena, Jorge Cajiga-Ruiz, Curtis Bradford and Andrea Kruger in three separate ambushes over 10 days last summer after his July 30 release from prison without supervision. While prosecutors say that Jenkins planned the killings to cover up robberies of the victims or to keep them from identifying him, Jenkins insisted he did not remember killing anyone, only that an Egyptian god named Ahpophis ordered him in a foreign language to kill the four as human sacrifices. Dr. Eugene Oliveto, who serves as a psychiatrist for the prison system in Douglas County, testified in a February hearing on Jenkins' competency that Jenkins was a 'psychopath' and 'one of the most dangerous people I have ever evaluated.' Bataillon found Jenkins competent to stand trial. Jenkins had flipped between expressing his guilt and declaring his innocence since being charged with the killings in September. After initially pleading not guilty, he declared in November that he wanted to plead guilty. He had changed his mind again by late January, saying he is mentally ill and should be released from jail. Psychopath: A psychiatrist called Jenkins, pictured, a 'psychopath' and said he was 'one of the most dangerous' people he'd ever evaluated . Scene: Prosecutors say Jenkins shot Juan Uribe-Pena, Jorge Cajiga-Ruiz, Curtis Bradford and Andrea Kruger in three separate ambushes over 10 days last summer after his July 30 release from prison without supervision. Seen is the scene of two of the deaths . During a contentious two-hour hearing in which Jenkins cursed and attempted to introduce various arguments rejected by the judge, he said Wednesday that he wanted to plead guilty because he believes his constitutional rights are being violated and that he can't get a fair trial in state court. The judge later let him plead no contest to the charges. Jenkins had tried to plead no contest to all the charges earlier this month, but the judge refused to accept the plea because of the severity of the charges. The judge later allowed Jenkins to plead no contest to the murder counts, as well, when Jenkins denied prosecutors' version of how Jenkins carried out the fatal shootings. 'My problem is, he disagrees with your factual analysis of the case,' Bataillon said to Douglas County Attorney Don Kleine, in explaining why he could not accept Jenkins' guilty pleas to the murder counts. 'He's not admitting to anything.' Police say Jenkins used a sawed-off 12-gauge shotgun loaded with deer slugs August 11 to kill Cajiga-Ruiz and Uribe-Pena, whose bodies were found inside a pickup truck in southeast Omaha. Eight days later, he used a small-caliber gun to kill Bradford, a one-time prison acquaintance. Then, on August 21, police say, Jenkins pulled Andrea Kruger from her SUV as she drove home from work and shot her four times before speeding off in her vehicle. Death: Prosecutors said Wednesday they will still seek the death penalty for Jenkins . Prosecutors said Wednesday they will still seek the death penalty for Jenkins, who waived his right to a jury trial on the question of whether he should be put to death or sentenced to life in prison without parole. A three-judge panel will instead decide his fate. Kleine said he doesn't know of a Nebraska case in which a person has been executed after pleading no contest to first-degree murder, but said Jenkins is not the first defendant to plead no contest and be convicted of first-degree murder. Jenkins' release from prison is one of several that have prompted the state to reconsider its supervised release programs. He had threatened violence while incarcerated and begged corrections officials to commit him to a mental health institution. A state ombudsman's report released in January faulted the department for its handling of the case. Two bills introduced by Senator Brad Ashford of Omaha on the topic were passed by the Nebraska Legislature this year and are awaiting the governor's approval. One would provide more supervision for former inmates and another would create programs that help them transition back to society.","Prosecutors say Nikko Jenkins, 27, shot Juan Uribe-Pena, Jorge Cajiga-Ruiz, Curtis Bradford and Andrea Kruger in three separate Omaha ambushes over 10 days last summer .

"Luis Suarez is now the third most valuable footballer in the world according to an authoritative new report, published today, that rates the Liverpool striker as worth £79million - at least. Only Barcelona’s Lionel Messi, with a ‘starting price’ of £161.5m and Real Madrid’s Cristiano Ronaldo, worth at least £85.2m, are valued more highly in the study, compiled by a Swiss-based expert research centre. The CIES Football Observatory has detailed knowledge of actual prices paid in thousands of transfers to ‘Big Five’ divisions over recent years, and have now published their annual review of players - including ‘market values’. VIDEO Scroll down to watch Messi scoring from behind the goal in training . Hit man: Luis Suarez was the Premier League's top scorer last season with Liverpool . Revealed: The 20 most valuable players in Europe . A huge range of information is considered for each player to produce a ‘real world’ price tag of what each star should objectively be worth in the transfer market this summer. Age, the length of contract remaining, position, performance data, international experience and the level at which the players are working are all considered. The stunning season enjoyed at Anfield by Uruguay forward Suarez, 27, has propelled him up the rankings of ‘most wanted’ among a string of elite clubs. The CIES study brackets his market value at between £79.4m and £92.3m. Suarez cost Liverpool £22.8m from Ajax in January 2011 and has been linked with some of Europe’s top clubs in recent days, from Real Madrid to Manchester United, who are reportedly ready to bid £65m. On the basis of the CIES study, that would represent a huge under-valuation of the player. The fourth most valuable man on the list is Chelsea’s Belgium starlet, Eden Hazard, 23, reckoned to be worth at least £61.2m. Chelsea paid around half that sum two years ago. Genius: Messi didn't have his best season at Barcelona, but is still the most valuable player in the world . The top 10 is completed by Paul Pogba of Juventus, Real Madrid’s Gareth Bale - rated at £47.1m at least, or considerably less than he cost last summer - then Arsenal’s Mesut Ozil, PSG’s Edinson Cavani and Bayern Munich’s Mario Gotze. Four England players make the top 20: Wayne Rooney plus three of the young Lions from Roy Hodgson’s World Cup squad - Raheem Sterling, Ross Barkley and Daniel Sturridge. Rooney is thought to be worth £29.6m, a bit less than the younger Sterling (£31.2m) and Barkley (£29.7m) and very lightly more than Sturridge (£29.4m). Outside the top 20, Arsenal’s Jack Wilshere is rated as worth at least £27.6m and Southampton’s Luke Shaw is worth £23.2m. Wizard: Ronaldo was named Ballon d'Or winner, with the Portugal striker enjoying a superb campaign . Value: Chelsea's Eden Hazard (left) is fourth, and Gareth Bale, the most expensive player on earth, was seventh . Any footballer is only worth what a club will pay for him, of course, but the CIES study shows that their evaluation process stands up to scrutiny, with only a small historical variation between their valuations on players and the prices they actually move for. The margin of error is fairly insignificant 7.5 per cent. Of the 20 highest valued players, nine of them play in the Premier League, for now at least, seven in Spain’s La Liga, two in Germany’s Bundesliga (Mario Gotze and Thomas Muller at Bayern Munich), one in France’s Ligue 1 (Cavani at PSG) and one in Italy’s Serie A (Pogba). At the top end of the chart, Messi’s value is almost twice that of Ronaldo’s. The report’s author’s say: ‘This is mainly related to the younger age of the Argentinian prodigy, who was born 28 months after the Portuguese superstar. ‘However, with respect to the last year, Messi’s market value has gone down (by €19m) while that of Ronaldo increased (by €4m). Prospect: Everton star Ross Barkley was ranked in the top 20 most valuable players in the World . England's future: Raheem Sterling was also in the top 20 after rising to fame with Liverpool .

"Russia's deputy prime minister has tweeted a picture mocking Barack Obama's masculinity just days after the U.S. president announced a fresh wave of sanctions against the country. Dmitry Rogozin uploaded an image of Russian president Vladimir Putin posing with a leopard alongside an image of Obama holding a white poodle. The peculiar display of one-upmanship was captioned 'We have different values ​​and allies,' making it clear what the Kremlin thinks of the U.S. president and his Western counterparts amid heightened tensions following the shooting down of flight MH17 in Ukraine, which left 298 people dead. Scroll down for video . Mockery: Russian deputy prime minister Dmitry Rogozin uploaded this image of Russian president Vladimir Putin posing with a leopard alongside an image of Obama holding a white poodle . Macho: Rogozin's image is the latest attempt by Russian officials to present Putin as an ultra-manly figure. He has previously posed for staged photographs topless on horseback . Rogozin's image has so far been retweeted more than 1,000 times and is the latest attempt by Russian officials to present Putin as an ultra-manly figure. He has previously posed for staged photographs topless on horseback, swimming at sea, embracing a polar bear and hang-gliding with migratory birds. The image of his posing with a snow leopard is believed to have been taken during a visit to a sanctuary in the run-up to the Sochi Winter Olympics last year. The photograph of Obama, meanwhile, is understood to have been taken in the mid-2000s when he was campaigning to become Senator of Illinois. It is not the first time Rogozin has taken to social media to defend his country's might. Earlier he tweeted a short YouTube documentary on the history of the Russian-made Ural tank.

Tough guy: Vladimir Putin has long been keen to show off his physical prowess as well as his political strength . Obama himself, meanwhile, is not exactly the most popular in the U.S., with his approval rating close to an all-time low in the crucial Ohio swing state. In many Democrat-voting areas of U.S. he is now seen as a less-popular figure than potential presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton, amid anger over his domestic policies on illegal immigration, health care and gun control. He has also been criticised for being more concerned about his celebrity image than foreign policy and was accused of 'partying while the world burns' when hosting a Katy Perry concert at the White House last night. As violence intensifies in Gaza, ISIS militants continue their brutal campaign in Iraq and Syria, and tensions with Russia reach Cold War levels, Obama introduced the pop star on stage with the words 'I love Katy Perry. She is just a wonderful person... for her to take time out to do this is really special.' Winning mentality: Putin is a fan of judo and often arranges photo shoots where he will take on and occasionally beat professional athletes . Not so tough: Although Rogozin suggested Obama was weak for posing with a dog, Putin obviously considers doesn't consider it a faux-pas.  Here he is seen snuggling up to his puppy he was given during a visit to Bulgaria . Rogozin's mocking tweet comes after EU countries and the United States tightened sanctions on Russia over its role in the Ukraine crisis.

"The nine-year-old daughter of a black, unarmed man  shot dead by a white Phoenix police officer who mistook a pill bottle for a gun is speaking out in an emotional interview. Rumain Brisbon, 34, was killed after an officer feared the suspect was armed during a struggle. Now his daughter Aiyana has made an emotional a plea to law enforcement across the country as she talks about how unnecessary the killing was, and how her father will never see her grow up. 'I felt like that it really didn't need to happen,' Aiyana Raines told Fox10. Scroll down for video . Emotional plea: Aiyana Raines, nine, (above) gave an emotional interview after an officer shot her father and said: 'The officer did not have the right to shoot my dad or kill him' Tragedy: Rumain Brisbon (above with his youngest daughter) was killed after an officer feared he was armed during a struggle, but it was just a pill bottle. The officer shot him twice in the torse . 'He is going to miss our birthdays and how my little sisters grow up, and how we grow up because she is the only one and I am only nine, and my sister is only 10, and my dad is not going to be here for our happy moments and our sad moments.' As for the moment she found out that her father had been killed, little Aiyana said, 'I started crying cause I really didn't believe that my dad got killed.' The Phoenix Police Department claim Brisbon was sitting in a Cadillac SUV on Tuesday evening and that witnesses told an officer he was selling drugs. Police approached him and made several demands for him to show his hands, but Brisbon fled. During a scuffle, the officer - a 30-year-old male officer with seven years experience on the force - felt a pill bottle in his waistband, which he believed was a gun. 'The officer gave the suspect several commands to get on the ground but he refused to comply, yelling profanities at the officer,' the Department said in a statement. 'Fearing Brisbon had a gun in his pocket the officer fired two rounds striking Brisbon in the torso.' He was pronounced dead at the scene. Questions: Police said Brisbon (above with his youngest daughter) was carrying a vial of oxycodone pills at the time of the incident. They had earlier received reports that he was selling drugs . Missed: The sisters, who are aged nine and 10, have said they won't have a father to watch them grow up . Rap sheet: Court documents show that Brisbon was known to authorities and had a criminal record including burglary, DUI, narcotics, and paraphernalia related charges . Police said Brisbon was carrying a vial of oxycodone pills, and that a semi-automatic handgun and a jar of marijuana were found in the SUV. A nearby resident told The Arizona Republic that he went over to the window after hearing the shooting and saw the officer 'walking out, and he was cussing, you know, he was screaming, ""F***, f***"", like upset that he shot the guy'. Sergeant Trent Crump, a Phoenix police spokesman, said at the Wednesday news conference that 'this one went bad from the standpoint of how it ended' but that they stood by the officer's actions. 'Let's be very clear,' he said. 'The officer was doing what we expect him to do, which is investigate crimes that neighbors are telling him are occurring in that part of the complex.' Friends, including the man who had been in the SUV with Brisbon, said that the victim was simply on his way to deliver fast food to his children in the apartment block. One witness said he did not see police officers trying to speak with Brisbon before the altercation. 'The Phoenix Police Department does not treat white people this way,' The Rev. Jarrett Maupin, who organized a march in the city on Thursday night, told KPNX. 'What that officer did was harass and accost them.' Gathering: Crowds formed on Thursday night in Phoenix to march to the police department . Planning: There are also rallies planned for the city on Friday evening as well . Aiyana also has a message for the officer . 'To the officer that killed my dad, let me tell you something,' she said. 'You hurt three little girls that looked up to their dad. 'I am hurting, but I have to stay strong for my dad and my little sister.' More importantly, she wants people to know that above all else, her dad was a 'good dad' and that 'the officer did not have the right to shoot my dad or kill him'. Marci A. Kratter, an attorney for Brisbon's family, told The Arizona Republic that witnesses disputed the official police account and that 'we intend to pursue this to the full extent of the law'. Court documents show that Brisbon had a criminal record including burglary, DUI, narcotics, and paraphernalia related charges. About 100 people marched to the Phoenix Police Department on Thursday evening to protest the fatal shooting, which was likened to the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York. Outrage: As the protests were underway in Phoenix, hundreds of demonstrators marched through Manhattan and across the Brooklyn Bridge (pictured) following the deaths of Eric Garner and Michael Brown . Both were unarmed black men who died after altercations with white police officers. Grand juries in both cities have decided not to indict the officers - sparking massive protests across the U.S. In Cleveland, there have also been protests after a black 12-year-old boy, Tamir Rice, who was shot dead by a white rookie police officer after he mistook the boy's fake gun for a real weapon. A grand jury is deciding whether or not to pursue charges in that case. In the protests in Phoenix on Thursday, demonstrators demanded to know the identity of the police officer who killed Brisbon. Another protest is scheduled for Friday night.","Rumain Brisbon, 34, was killed after Phoenix police say an officer feared the suspect was armed during a struggle .

"Legalising assisted suicide is a slippery slope toward widespread killing of the sick, MPs and peers were told yesterday. A former euthanasia supporter warned of a surge in deaths if Parliament allowed doctors to give deadly drugs to their patients. ‘Don’t do it Britain,’ said Theo Boer, a veteran European watchdog in assisted suicide cases. ‘Once the genie is out of the bottle, it is not likely ever to go back in again.’ Scroll down for video . How the toll has risen: The Netherlands has seen deaths double in just six years . His . native Netherlands, where euthanasia has been legal since 2002, has . seen deaths double in just six years and this year’s total may reach a . record 6,000. Professor . Boer’s intervention comes as peers prepare to debate the Assisted Dying . Bill, promoted by Lord Falconer, a Labour former Lord Chancellor. The . bill, which has its second reading next week, would allow doctors to . prescribe poison to terminally ill and mentally alert people who wish to . kill themselves. Professor . Boer, who is an academic in the field of ethics, had argued seven years . ago that a ‘good euthanasia law’ would produce relatively low numbers of . deaths. Peers are preparing to debate the Assisted Dying Bill which was promoted by Lord Falconer, a Labour former Lord Chancellor . But, speaking in a . personal capacity yesterday, he said he now believed that the very . existence of a euthanasia law turns assisted suicide from a last resort . into a normal procedure. A . ‘slippery slope’ for assisted dying in Britain would mean that . euthanasia would follow the same path as abortion, which was legalised . in 1967. There are now . nearly 200,000 terminations a year. Anti-euthanasia campaigners and . disability activists called on politicians to listen to the professor’s . warning. The Paralympian, Baroness Tanni Grey-Thompson, said: ‘What Dr Boer says comes as no surprise. ‘An . assisted dying law is playing with fire, especially when there are no . safeguards in place. Lord Falconer’s bill just isn’t fit for purpose.’ Baroness . Jane Campbell, who is a disability rights campaigner, said: ‘As happens . in Holland, Lord Falconer’s bill could end up encompassing significant . numbers of seriously ill people.’ Euthanasia . is now becoming so prevalent in the Netherlands, Professor Boer said, . that it is ‘on the way to becoming a default mode of dying for cancer . patients’. He said . assisted deaths have increased by about 15 per cent every year since . 2008 and the number could hit a record 6,000 this year. He . said he was concerned at the extension of killing to new classes of . people, including the demented and the depressed, and the establishment . of mobile death units of ‘travelling euthanasing doctors’. Activists, . Professor Boer said, continue to campaign for doctor-administered death . to be made ever easier and ‘will not rest’ until a lethal pill is made . available to anyone over 70 who wishes to die.‘Some slopes truly are slippery,’ he added. The . Utrecht University academic has been a member since 2005 of a review . committee charged with monitoring euthanasia deaths. Its role includes a . duty to ‘tell doctors how their actions in particular cases are likely . to stand up to legal, medical and ethical scrutiny’. Professor Boer admitted he was ‘wrong – terribly wrong, in fact’ to have believed regulated euthanasia would work. ‘I used to be a supporter of the Dutch law. But now, with 12 years of experience, I take a very different view. Theo Boer (left) warned of a surge in deaths which Tanni Grey-Thompson (right) said came as no surprise . ‘Whereas . in the first years after 2002 hardly any patients with psychiatric . illnesses or dementia appear in reports, these numbers are now sharply . on the rise. ‘Cases have . been reported in which a large part of the suffering of those given . euthanasia or assisted suicide consisted in being aged, lonely or . bereaved. ‘Some of . these patients could have lived for years or decades. Pressure on . doctors to conform to patients’ – or in some cases relatives’ – wishes . can be intense. ‘Pressure . from relatives, in combination with a patient’s concern for their . wellbeing, is in some cases an important factor behind a euthanasia . request. Not even the review committees, despite hard and conscientious . work, have been able to halt these developments.’ The latest euthanasia figures for the Netherlands show that nearly one in seven deaths are at the hands of doctors. Dignitas is Zurich-based organisation which helps people to kill themselves.  Candidates have to fill in an official form to prove they want to commit suicide . In . 2012, there were 4,188 deaths by direct euthanasia – 3 per cent of all . deaths – and 3,695 deaths by direct euthanasia in 2011. The . figures do not include deaths by terminal sedation, where patients are . rendered unconscious before they are dehydrated and starved to death, an . act often referred to as ‘euthanasia by omission’. This practice accounts for more than 12 per cent of all deaths in the country. The . Netherlands is following a pattern that anti-euthanasia campaigners say . has happened wherever the practice has been legalised. Doctors . in neighbouring Belgium are collectively killing an average of five . people every day by euthanasia – with a 27 per cent surge in one year. Dignity . in Dying, the pressure group which supports Lord Falconer’s bill, . dismissed fears that the legislation might lead to similar horrors. Its . spokesman James Harris said: ‘Lord Falconer’s Assisted Dying Bill will . not legalise euthanasia, rather assisted dying for adults who are . terminally ill and mentally competent, similar to legislation in Oregon . which has been working safely for over 17 years and has never been . extended beyond the criteria of terminal illness.’ Anti-euthanasia campaigners dispute that the Oregon law is safe or that limited numbers are dying at their own request. Elspeth . Chowdharay-Best, honorary secretary of Alert, the anti-euthanasia . pressure group, said legalising assisted suicide would be like ‘stepping . off a precipice’. ‘It means that you would lose the right to live,’ she . said. ‘It is more serious than people realise.’ Under Lord Falconer’s bill, a terminally-ill patient would be able to ask for drugs to kill him or herself. Two . doctors would need to approve, and to be satisfied the patient was of . sound mind and settled view, and had not been influenced by others. In 2001 The Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalise euthanasia and, along with it, assisted suicide. Various ‘safeguards’ were put in place to show who should qualify and doctors acting in accordance with these ‘safeguards’ would not be prosecuted. Because each case is unique, five regional review committees were installed to assess every case and to decide whether it complied with the law. For five years after the law became effective, such physician-induced deaths remained level - and even fell in some years. In 2007 I wrote that ‘there doesn’t need to be a slippery slope when it comes to euthanasia. A good euthanasia law, in combination with the euthanasia review procedure, provides the warrants for a stable and relatively low number of euthanasia.’ Most of my colleagues drew the same conclusion. But we were wrong - terribly wrong, in fact. In hindsight, the stabilisation in the numbers was just a temporary pause. Beginning in 2008, the numbers of these deaths show an increase of 15% annually, year after year. The annual report of the committees for 2012 recorded 4,188 cases (compared with 1,882 in 2002). 2013 saw a continuation of this trend and I expect the 6,000 line to be crossed this year or the next. Euthanasia is on the way to become a ‘default’ mode of dying for cancer patients. Alongside this escalation other developments have taken place. Under the name ‘End of Life Clinic,’ the Dutch Right to Die Society NVVE founded a network of travelling euthanizing doctors. Whereas the law presupposes (but does not require) an established doctor-patient relationship, in which death might be the end of a period of treatment and interaction, doctors of the End of Life Clinic have only two options: administer life-ending drugs or send the patient away. On average, these physicians see a patient three times before administering drugs to end their life. Hundreds of cases were conducted by the End of Life Clinic. The NVVE shows no signs of being satisfied even with these developments. They will not rest until a lethal pill is made available to anyone over 70 years who wishes to die. Some slopes truly are slippery. Other developments include a shift in the type of patients who receive these ‘treatments’. Whereas in the first years after 2002 hardly any patients with psychiatric illnesses or dementia appear in reports, these numbers are now sharply on the rise. Cases have been reported in which a large part of the suffering of those given euthanasia or assisted suicide consisted in being aged, lonely or bereaved. Some of these patients could have lived for years or decades. Whereas the law sees assisted suicide and euthanasia as an exception, public opinion is shifting towards considering them rights, with corresponding duties on doctors to act. A law that is now in the making obliges doctors who refuse to administer euthanasia to refer their patients to a ‘willing’ colleague. Pressure on doctors to conform to patients’ (or in some cases relatives’) wishes can be intense. Pressure from relatives, in combination with a patient’s concern for their wellbeing, is in some cases an important factor behind a euthanasia request. Not even the Review Committees, despite hard and conscientious work, have been able to halt these developments. I used to be a supporter of the Dutch law.  But now, with twelve years of experience, I take a very different view. At the very least, wait for an honest and intellectually satisfying analysis of the reasons behind the explosive increase in the numbers. Is it because the law should have had better safeguards? Or is it because the mere existence of such a law is an invitation to see assisted suicide and euthanasia as a normality instead of a last resort? Before those questions are answered, don’t go there. Once the genie is out of the bottle, it is not likely to ever go back in again.Theo Boer has been a Member of a Regional Review Committee since 2005. For the Dutch Government, five such committees assess whether a euthanasia case was conducted in accordance with the Law. In the past nine years, Prof. Boer has reviewed almost 4,000 euthanasia cases. The views expressed here represent his views as a professional ethicist, not of any institution.","Theo Boer, a European assisted suicide watchdog, said 'don't do it'

"A group calling itself 'The Women of the 99 Percent' is making robocalls across the United States in an attempt to link Republican members of the House of Representatives to 'the war on women led by Rush Limbaugh'. The automated calls are illegal because they do not state who they are from (there is no known group called The Women of the 99 Percent) or provide a callback number, as required under the U.S. Telephone Consumer Protection Act of 1991. They appear to be the most aggressive attempt yet by Democrats to exploit politically the recent furore over comments by the controversial conservative radio talk show host. Scroll down to hear the call . Controversy: Rush Limbaugh kicked off a national firestorm with his comments . Limbaugh apologised last Sunday for his 'insulting word choices' when speaking about Sandra Fluke, a student activist campaigning for contraception to be paid for by Georgetown University, a Catholic institution, under President Barack Obama's healthcare reform. The radio host had said she was a 'slut' because she was asking to be paid for having sex and then commented that she should repay the public by releasing videos of her sexual activities 'so we can all watch'. Limbaugh's comments had been widely denounced, including by John Boehner, Republican Speaker of the House of Representatives, and Barack Obama, in what Republicans branded an attempt to make political capital, telephoned Fluke to commiserate. Democrats have been taking Republicans to task over the comments. David Axelrod, the Obama campaign's top strategist, said that Mitt Romney, the Republican frontrunner, had failed 'a test of leadership' over 'the Limbaugh thing'. He ask how if a candidate couldn't stand up to 'the most strident voices in your party, how can he stand up to Ahmadinejad?' Activist: The radio host called Sandra Fluke a 'slut' after she spoke out in favour of easy access to contraception . A call left on the answering machine of Paula Bolyard of Doylestown, Ohio yesterday stated: 'Hello, this is a message from Women of the 99 Percent. Congressman Jim Renacci is condoning the war on women led by Rush Limbaugh, who has become the de facto leader of the Republican party. 'Call Congressman Renacci at 330-489-4414 and ask him why he remains silent while Republican spokesman Rush Limbaugh insults, degrades, and verbally abuses women. Tell Congressman Renacci that it’s just plain shameful that he that he allows Rush Limbaugh’s behaviour to continue. We are the Women of the 99 Percent and we won’t be silent anymore.' As well Mrs Bolyard's Ohio-16 district of Representative Jim Renacci, there were similar calls in Rep. Roscoe Bartlett's Maryland-6, Rep. Dan Benishek's Michigan-1, Rep. Judy Biggert's Illinois-13, Rep. Tim Johnson's Illinois-15, Rep. Bobby Schilling's Illinois-17 and Rep. Scott Rigell's Virginia-2. The robocalls prompted hundreds of angry calls to Republican congressional offices. Target: Constituents of Ohio Republican Jim Renacci have been contacted by a robocall focussed around Mr Limbaugh . Mrs Bolyard sent out a tweet about the call and then posted an audio file of it on the RedState website after being contacted by MailOnline. In a blog post, she wrote: 'Apparently, unless you are throwing a public temper tantrum about Rush’s inappropriate and malicious comments, you are ""condoning"" them. By this standard, 99 per cent of the country is guilty.' She added: 'We should all feel great compassion for the poor souls who had to answer the phones and listen to the angry rants that resulted from these robocalls.' A blogger called 'Corinthian Scales' from Michigan wrote that the claim against Rep Dan Benishek was 'one wildly outrageous accusation to make by an unidentified ""group"" who, by the way, is now intruding into the privacy of my home. 'Hmmm... no number shows on the caller ID, and *69 only prompts the phone company's recorded message that they are unable to determine the phone number used.' Criticism: John Boehner, Speaker of the Hous of Representatives, is one of many Republicans to have spoken out against Mr Limbaugh . Last week, the Democratic . Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) organised a petition accusing . Republicans of having 'launched an all-out war on women'. The . petition said that Republicans were 'trying to silence women who stand . against their radical agenda' and Americans had witnessed 'top . Republican leaders squirm at denouncing or even criticising Rush . Limbaugh after he called women's health care advocate Sandra Fluke a . ""slut"" and a ""prostitute"" on his radio show.' Phil Bloomer, spokesman for Rep. Johnson, said that some people calling as a result of the robocalls were not even in the congressman's district but part of a new district created after boundary changes he will be running for in November - a sign the calls are linked to this year's elections. He said: 'How do we not ""allow"" Rush Limbaugh to say what he wants? We believe in free speech. At the same time, we don’t condone name-calling or caustic language from either the Left or Right. That is why Representative Johnson formed the Center Aisle Caucus in 2005 and continually advocates civility.' Andrea Pivarunas, spokeswoman for Rep. Schilling, said: 'We were surprised to hear this since Representative Schilling spoke out about this days ago. 'He stated Mr Limbaugh’s comments on the religious freedom issue are deplorable and wrong, just as he also feels that the Obama Administration is wrong to violate the religious conscience rights of others. We hope the organisation spreading these inaccurate statements will issue a retraction.' Telephone calls and emails to the DCCC and the Democratic National Committee asking whether either organisation was connected to the robocalls were not returned. Listen to the call .

"Most men enjoy a good pint of lager or real ale while they are watching football or relaxing with friends. Very few would dedicate themselves for more than two decades to the world's longest pub crawl. But six friends from the West Midlands have embarked on a special quest to drink in a different pub every Saturday night - and have done so for 28 years. Peter Hill, 56, his father John Hill, 81, John Drew, 48, Kelvin Price, 34, Richard Hill, 30, and Gary Mountain, 54, make up the Black Country Ale Tairsters (BATs) and have been to a total of 16,337 pubs, hotels and wine bars. Cheers! Peter Hill (left), John Drew (middle) and Kelvin Price (right) from the Black Country Ale Tairsters  enjoying a pint at their local . Living the dream: BATs have visited a new pub every Saturday night for 28 years, they've been to more than 16,000 . Originally a team of 20 when it started in 1984, the BATs have now slimmed down to half a dozen men on a serious mission. They have vowed to visit very single pub in the West Midlands even going as far as fashioning a rather fetching uniform out of beer towels. While it may seem as simple as walking into a pub and ordering a pint, there’s a strict science behind holding the longest bar crawl world record, as organiser of the group Peter, from West Bromwich explains. Stylish: They group were so dedicated that they decided to make their own uniform fashioned out of beer towels . Banter: The friends look happy together as they share a joke and a pint on an overcast afternoon in West Bromwich . He said: 'We have our own score cards which we fill in and give to the pub we go to. 'We write the number of the pub on the card, and ask the landlord to sign the book we have which has information in from every pub we go to. 'We also keep a record of the pubs we go to by taking a photo of the pub, inside and out and make a note of anything special about the place.'The men believe they hold the title for the world’s longest pub crawl, and have kept thousands of souvenirs to prove it. Including 130 box files full of beer mats and menus and 35,000 photos. Stamp of approval: The BATs legendary commitment has turned them into real ale connoisseurs . Lads: Peter, John and Kelvin are three of six that make up the mighty Black Country Ale Tairsters - there used to 20 members when the club was founded in 1984 . Every pub they visit is rated, photos are taken and information is noted down and BATs approval is a recognised accolade in the local pub trade. Their almost obsessive hobby demands a certain amount of patience from their partners who sometimes accompany them to the pub - but are strictly banned from the BATs regular four-day boozy weekends away. Girlfriend Crystal Tromans, 24, from Tipton, West Midlands, spoke of her six year relationship with Kelvin Price. She said: 'When I started going out with Kelvin, it was clear from the start that beer was part of the package. 'They have done it for so long, you know what you’re getting into - you can’t complain. The BATs are committed to finding new pubs in Britain and Europe - this picture was taken during a visit Bankss, in Budvar . Day out: The gang are photographed at the Smiths Arms, Godmanstone, as they continue the world's longest bar crawl . 'He enjoys his hobby and he lets me do what I want to do, plus it’s nice to get some time to myself! 'I do sometimes go to the pub with him on a weekend if they’re meeting nearby, as some of the other partners do but we’re not allowed to go on the lads’ weekends - that’s definitely more of a man thing! 'When we go away I can’t keep him away from new pubs and breweries - he’s always trying to hunt out some real ale. 'Kelvin wants me to learn to drive so that I can ferry him about on his pub trips - good try.' Dedication: The BATs keep a detailed log of pubs they have visited - their approval has become something of an accolade in the local pub trade . The BATs raise money for childrens’ hospitals along their way by asking each pub landlord they buy beer from to donate £1 to a deserving cause, so far raising over £15,000. They have also made trips to pubs right across Europe but they say these pubs don't count because they are not in the UK. The Tame Bridge public house in Great Bridge, West Bromwich, West Midlands is one of the team’s favourite local pubs. That's better: Peter raises his pint as the other BATs take a sip of their first pint of the day outside their favourite pub . Local: The BATs allow their wives and girlfriends to come for a drink in the week but they are strictly banned from the boozy weekends away . Owner, David Parsons, 67, said: 'These men are incredible - they are such a presence in the pub here. 'They have changed this pub, we used to serve a lot of lager but since they started coming with the knowledge they have of real ales, we sell a lot of the stuff. 'We get a different crowd in here now, and I love being educated about what they know about real ale. Calling card: The group invested in personalised beer mats - which they leave in every pub they visit . Pub number 15,440! The Old Moseley Arms in Birmingham - the BATs have visited 16,337 and have vowed to drink in every pub in the West Midlands . 'What they don’t know about beer, no-one does! 'I don’t think their quest will ever end, they will always find new territories when it comes to beer.' The BATs latest quest is to have been to every pub in the Midlands by the end of 2014. Sunshine: The Bats were lucky to have a good weather when they visited pub number 15,499 The Paddock, Penally . Rain: The boys endured summer showers to visit pub number 15,520 - The Cresselly Arms, Pembrokeshire . Historical: Pub number 15,491 The Charlton, Pembroke Dock, looks staunchly traditional from the outside . Peter added: 'It’s great to have made it to many milestones, and exciting to think of what we have to come. 'It’s hard to think of a hobby which is so much fun. 'When we’ve finished our current quest, we will just move on to another county. I’ll be doing this for as long as I can - I intend to visit every pub I can.' Beer there and everywhere: BAT member Peter Hill has even written a book about his many experiences .","The Black Country Ale Tairsters have been to 16,337 pubs, hotels and wine bars .

"A Facebook page seeking to preserve the 'Black Pete' clowns in blackface who accompany St. Nicholas to the Netherlands during the holidays has become the fastest-growing Dutch-language page ever, receiving 1 million 'likes' in a single day. The popularity of the 'Pete-ition' page reflects the emotional attachment most Dutch have to a figure that helped launch the tradition of Santa Claus. It also reflects their anger at critics who call it racist. Those critics include foreigners who they feel don't understand the tradition. They also include many of the country's most prominent black people. Facebook page: The U.N. has condemned the Christmas tradition but a Facebook page set up in support of it has attracted huge attention . 'Don't let the Netherlands' most beautiful tradition disappear,' the page says. On Tuesday, the chairwoman of a U.N. Human Rights Commission panel condemned it. 'The working group does not understand why it is that people in the Netherlands cannot see that this is a throwback to slavery, and that in the 21st century this practice should stop,' Verene Shepherd told television program EenVandaag. In stories told to children, St. Nicholas - Sinterklaas in Dutch - arrives by steamboat from Spain in mid-November accompanied by a horde of helpers: 'Zwarte Pieten,' or 'Black Petes', who have black faces, red lips and curly hair. A public broadcaster produces a daily fictional news program about Sinterklaas and the Petes that is shown in schools for several weeks. On December 5, families read poems and exchange presents as part of the Dutch-Belgian festival that is one of the main sources of the Santa Claus traditions. Opponents say Pete is an offensive caricature of black people. Supporters say Pete is a positive figure whose appearance is harmless. Popular: A musician dressed up as 'Black Pete' during last year's Christmas celebrations . The traditional song refers to Pete as a 'servant' to the elderly saint, but in recent years those references have been replaced with the idea that he is black from chimney soot as he scrambles down to deliver toys and sweets for children who leave their shoes out overnight. Discussion about Zwarte Piet has escalated since 2011, when a prominent opponent was thrown to the ground, handcuffed by police and dragged away for wearing a T-shirt reading 'Black Pete is Racism'. Opposition has been centered in Amsterdam, home to the Netherlands' largest black community. Mayor Eberhard van der Laan this month said he would support changing Pete's appearance - but only gradually, as it has changed over time in the past. 'If it appears that Amsterdammers feel pain as a result of this tradition, that's a good reason for new development,' he said. Controversial: Many claim that the tradition is offensive towards black people . Organizers of the festival and the broadcaster also said they would be open to changes if people want them. The latest public figure to speak out against the tradition was the man who has played the part of 'Head Pete' on the Sinterklaas news program for more than a decade. His commentary appeared in a top Dutch newspaper on Tuesday, entitled 'Make me less black and less a servant.' Others to question the tradition include Victoria's Secret model Doutzen Kroes. But their campaign has failed to draw widespread support and the overwhelming majority of Dutch people don't want change. 'Message for the U.N.: Isn't there a war somewhere, starvation or genocide going on that you could better be concerned about?' Dutchman Peter Udo commented on the Facebook page. His comment attracted more than 2,000 likes. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said it isn't his place to intervene in a folk tradition. 'Black Pete: The name says it already. He's black,' he said. 'I can't change much about it.'","Facebook page supporting tradition gains one million 'likes' in a day .
